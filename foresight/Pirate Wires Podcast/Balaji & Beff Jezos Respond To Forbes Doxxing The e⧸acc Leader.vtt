WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.280
They not only doxxed the correlation between my principal identity and Beth Jesus, but the voice doxxed me.

00:07.280 --> 00:10.800
I didn't want to talk to them, but then they're like, look, this is going to really come out.

00:10.800 --> 00:13.600
I'm like, all right, well, I better try to control the narrative.

00:13.600 --> 00:16.480
I thought there was a sort of like ethical protection.

00:16.480 --> 00:20.880
Like, no, I've been trying to figure out, like, why did this happen to me?

00:20.880 --> 00:28.880
Like, where did I cross the threshold of becoming enough of a problem that they needed to have leverage over me and expose me?

00:29.680 --> 00:36.880
Our movement is about free speech, freedom of compute, freedom of AI, and not, like, top-down oppression.

00:36.880 --> 00:39.120
I have failed, honestly, and apology to you two.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.400
We both, you failed.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.240
I don't know why you're talking to them.

00:42.240 --> 00:43.520
Do not talk to journalists.

00:44.960 --> 00:47.200
I said, don't talk to journalists.

00:47.920 --> 00:49.840
You do not try to violate this rule.

00:50.400 --> 00:51.520
You will regret it.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.360
Welcome back to the pod.

01:01.360 --> 01:07.760
We have the, we've got, are we saying Beth Jesus or where are we going with this?

01:08.480 --> 01:10.240
You could call me both names.

01:10.240 --> 01:18.080
I go by both names now, Beth Jesus or Gil Verdon in America, Guillaume Valdon in Canada and France, if you will.

01:18.080 --> 01:27.040
So finally, after it's been honestly too long, the legendary biology doesn't even get a,

01:27.120 --> 01:28.960
does not even need a second name.

01:28.960 --> 01:31.600
It's like, you know, Madonna or who are the other ones?

01:31.600 --> 01:32.160
I don't even know.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.760
And you might be like, I guess.

01:33.760 --> 01:34.160
Teal, I guess.

01:34.160 --> 01:39.360
Well, I, you know, it's not quite, it's not, it's biology.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.440
We are here today.

01:41.440 --> 01:43.200
This is, I'm stoked about this episode.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.080
This is going to be a great one.

01:44.080 --> 01:44.880
And both of you guys, thank you.

01:44.880 --> 01:46.080
You're on a different time zone.

01:46.080 --> 01:47.760
It's been a while setting this up.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.960
But biology and I have been talking about, and biology, I mean, separately from each other,

01:52.960 --> 01:59.680
but also together, media and the shape of media for years through like tech dark ages,

01:59.680 --> 02:05.120
back when we had no counter voice whatsoever, up until today where I think things are still

02:05.120 --> 02:08.640
not balanced, but very different than they were three years ago, certainly during COVID.

02:08.640 --> 02:13.920
And before that, Gil, you were, I'll just break it down.

02:13.920 --> 02:21.520
I mean, so Beth Jesus, kind of popular anonymous account on Twitter, you run something called

02:21.520 --> 02:30.640
the EACC, which we'll get into in a bit or Yak doxxed by Forbes, Emily Baker White of Forbes,

02:30.640 --> 02:36.400
in concert with Alex Conrad, which is an important part of this story because Alex,

02:37.040 --> 02:40.000
it's important to me at least, and I want to talk about it with both of you guys in a minute,

02:40.000 --> 02:41.920
because Alex is so influential in tech.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.440
I mean, he runs the Midas list.

02:43.440 --> 02:44.160
Everybody knows him.

02:44.160 --> 02:45.360
Everybody talks to him.

02:45.360 --> 02:47.200
And that is a problem.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.120
And, and I do want to get into it.

02:49.120 --> 02:55.120
But long story short, these guys hit you up or Emily hits you up and she's got your,

02:55.120 --> 02:56.400
she's got your real identity.

02:56.400 --> 03:01.120
So you've been writing anonymously about EACC for what about a couple of years at this point,

03:01.120 --> 03:05.200
when this happens, have a little bit of a community.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.720
I would say I'm going to kind of characterize what I think you guys do.

03:08.720 --> 03:11.600
And then you can come in here and give me the real version according to you.

03:12.240 --> 03:17.200
I think you guys were memeing about the future and you're definitely counterpointing the EA stuff.

03:17.200 --> 03:23.200
You're sort of like cleverly cutting against the doomer narrative in a fun way.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.600
I've always seen it as very like lighthearted.

03:25.600 --> 03:31.440
I've noticed this week, the EA crowd has been very personally aggrieved by you.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.520
And it gave me a giant question mark then.

03:33.520 --> 03:39.040
I was like, why is, why is the media gone to, to war against you?

03:39.040 --> 03:40.000
I have a few theories.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.680
I'd love to hear apology, your theory especially, because I'm sure you have one at this point.

03:45.680 --> 03:46.320
Sure.

03:46.320 --> 03:52.080
Your link Gill to Mark Andreessen and Gary Tan specifically seems to me

03:52.080 --> 03:56.000
like the reason that you became something that needed to be destroyed and shamed.

03:57.680 --> 03:58.960
So that's my version of events.

03:58.960 --> 04:02.080
You know, EACC born, you represented.

04:02.080 --> 04:09.360
It's a positive, futurist, anti-doomer, pro-progress, pro-AI specifically kind of movement.

04:10.400 --> 04:13.920
You are, they think sass needed obviously doesn't work out that way for them.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.120
You're much more popular now.

04:16.560 --> 04:20.320
Hans to talk about what first things first, like what is your version of those events?

04:22.000 --> 04:22.320
Yeah.

04:22.320 --> 04:28.880
I mean, for me, it was, it was a crazy Friday and it's been a crazy couple of days since then.

04:28.880 --> 04:33.280
I'm like halfway across the world right now and undisclosed location that is not China.

04:34.640 --> 04:36.880
And, you know, on a business trip.

04:36.880 --> 04:39.680
So I'm still, you know, doing, doing what I do.

04:39.680 --> 04:40.400
I'm entrepreneur.

04:41.440 --> 04:41.760
Yeah.

04:41.760 --> 04:45.680
Originally, basically I get a text from like investors.

04:45.680 --> 04:51.360
So, so first of all, I, you know, I came, you know, as, as I was doxed, you know, I came from

04:51.360 --> 04:56.480
Google X, you know, I worked on projects with the leadership there very closely, you know,

04:56.480 --> 04:57.600
very secretive projects.

04:57.600 --> 05:00.080
I was used to sort of secrecy as my baseline.

05:01.280 --> 05:05.840
And to some extent, like spending years, see, super secretive.

05:05.840 --> 05:07.920
You can't talk about what you do and so on.

05:07.920 --> 05:08.960
It's kind of a burden.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.120
And that's originally how I started.

05:11.120 --> 05:16.080
Beth Jesus was just like, as an outlet for me to communicate with people about stuff and just talk.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.080
And, you know, I've kept that, that account since then.

05:21.280 --> 05:24.400
But, you know, I had a startup as well that was not doxed.

05:24.400 --> 05:33.040
Like these, they not only doxed the correlation between my principal identity and Beth Jesus,

05:33.040 --> 05:39.680
but they correlated my principal identity, my current company, and even they traced through,

05:39.680 --> 05:41.040
you know, name changes of the company.

05:41.760 --> 05:43.920
They even like went through my Facebook.

05:43.920 --> 05:47.520
They went, the voice docs me, they just correlated everything.

05:47.520 --> 05:52.400
It was like a full, like, you know, full definition.

05:52.400 --> 05:55.680
When they punched your identity, it was like something out of a spy movie.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.120
They went in on you.

05:58.320 --> 06:00.480
They really threw resources at this.

06:00.480 --> 06:00.800
Yeah.

06:00.800 --> 06:04.960
Like, I mean, for me, you know, like, I think like, you know, I believe what I, I believe

06:05.760 --> 06:09.120
large majority of what I say is Beth, sometimes it's kind of like, you know,

06:09.120 --> 06:12.960
meta-ironic, you know, extreme posts as one does on Twitter.

06:12.960 --> 06:16.560
But like most of it, you know, like I'm all in, like I don't mind like,

06:17.840 --> 06:21.200
you know, backing, you know, using my main identity back, what I say with,

06:21.200 --> 06:23.520
what I have said with Beth.

06:23.520 --> 06:28.800
But to me, it was like, hey, I didn't give you the right to disclose like that I'm doing

06:28.800 --> 06:30.560
this like deep deck startup as well.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.200
You know, I mean, some technologies.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.080
Have the right there.

06:34.080 --> 06:34.640
This is a thing.

06:34.640 --> 06:38.400
It's like, this is the whole thing for me watching this is, this is,

06:39.040 --> 06:41.360
this is not the first time that the press has done this.

06:42.320 --> 06:43.840
This happens often.

06:44.400 --> 06:48.240
And it's, it's, this question of rights comes up.

06:48.240 --> 06:50.240
It's like, we can do this, they say.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.200
It's like, yes, you can.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.120
But the question is like, is it ethical?

06:53.120 --> 06:54.480
What kind of world do you want to live in?

06:55.600 --> 07:01.200
And obviously from where I'm sitting, it just seems the purpose of revealing your identity

07:01.200 --> 07:06.480
is to scare other people who are sharing their opinions in this space,

07:06.480 --> 07:08.240
anonymously from doing so.

07:08.240 --> 07:12.160
They, it's a, it's a, it's a, it is a strategy to chill speech.

07:12.160 --> 07:14.960
I don't have to worry about speaking for the most part within reason.

07:14.960 --> 07:15.840
It's way easier for me.

07:15.840 --> 07:18.400
I don't run a tech company in stealth.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.880
I work for Peter Teal at Founders Fund.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.040
And on the pirate wire side, I run my own business.

07:23.040 --> 07:26.480
It's like there, I am, and the business is speaking.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.880
It's like, it's, it's easier for me to do it.

07:28.880 --> 07:30.000
For someone like you, it's harder.

07:30.000 --> 07:30.640
They know that.

07:30.640 --> 07:33.360
And the point is they want to kind of take you off the map.

07:33.360 --> 07:33.760
Apology.

07:33.760 --> 07:37.680
Why do you think, I mean, do you have any, you can take this anywhere you want.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.840
Obviously you might have something you want to share in particular,

07:39.840 --> 07:41.920
but I would really love to know kind of like what you think,

07:42.720 --> 07:46.800
what you think the motivation behind this specific targeting was.

07:48.400 --> 07:52.880
So, my views on this have somewhat evolved.

07:53.280 --> 08:01.200
Fundamentally, the journalists are, are tribe and they're a sub tribe nowadays of

08:02.080 --> 08:06.800
the overall, you know, whether you call it the regime, the paper belt, the cathedral,

08:06.800 --> 08:11.760
the establishment, the deep state, what have you, that is a set of people.

08:12.480 --> 08:15.520
And it is a group of people that is, you know, FUBU,

08:15.520 --> 08:18.880
you guys remember FUBU from the nineties for us bias.

08:18.880 --> 08:19.600
Okay.

08:19.600 --> 08:24.320
So, like the regime is nationalist for the regime.

08:24.320 --> 08:27.040
You know, it's like to first order, you could say it's Democrats,

08:27.040 --> 08:29.280
you could say it's deep state, you could say a cathedral.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.840
There's like a lot of different names for this, which are all overlapping.

08:32.400 --> 08:35.840
But basically, if you take the whole social network of, you know,

08:36.400 --> 08:40.320
eight billion people in the world and 300 million Americans and so on and so forth,

08:40.320 --> 08:43.360
this is a sub graph in the social network that's densely connected.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.920
And it's sure unless it's professors, it's regulators, it's bureaucrats and so on and so

08:47.920 --> 08:53.040
forth. And everybody who is not them is an enemy.

08:54.640 --> 09:03.120
And that means that they're at simultaneous war with tech, with Trump, with China, with Russia,

09:03.120 --> 09:08.400
with India, with Israel, like, and you can, some of these there are more at war with than others,

09:08.400 --> 09:11.840
right? They don't like India very much, but they're like somewhat fighting it.

09:11.840 --> 09:14.880
They don't like Israel very much, and they've got some outlet, right?

09:14.880 --> 09:19.840
But basically, once you look at it as a giant social network in different colors of subgraphs,

09:20.880 --> 09:28.000
the journalist, you know, like blue subgraph is at war with within America,

09:28.000 --> 09:33.200
the red subgraph and the gray or tech subgraph, right? And so that's like the first order,

09:33.200 --> 09:39.680
like visual of the whole battle space. It's not, this is not like a discussion.

09:39.680 --> 09:44.480
This is not like a normal story. This is information warfare of one tribe versus another.

09:44.560 --> 09:51.600
This is meant to harm you. And even if this first one is just like a tracer bullet,

09:52.400 --> 09:58.640
or like a flare to sort of light up the position, right, then subsequent kinds of things may or may

09:58.640 --> 10:07.040
not be so positive or would have, right? And so that's like first is basically, it's not a,

10:07.040 --> 10:12.080
it's not a positive thing to go and dock somebody against their will. You do not do that to a friend,

10:12.080 --> 10:17.200
right? You do not do that to somebody who you mean well to. You don't stalk them for months.

10:17.200 --> 10:22.560
And, you know, basically in your, in your, and you know, correct me if I'm wrong, Guillaume,

10:22.560 --> 10:28.000
but they basically gave you, you know, they told you they had all this dirt on you and they're like,

10:28.000 --> 10:32.960
well, you better speak with us or else, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like I got a text from investors

10:32.960 --> 10:38.640
the night before from, I think it was Alex Conrad told investors like, oh, hey, I correlated

10:38.640 --> 10:43.680
Beth J. Zos and Guillaume. I think he's a portfolio company. They had the old name of my startup. So

10:43.680 --> 10:50.720
I changed the name of my startup for further upsec and for branding eventually. But the,

10:50.720 --> 10:56.960
they hadn't put it all together. And then they censor fused across reporters, like, and then they

10:56.960 --> 11:01.760
had much more, they had too much put together and they wanted to, they were going to put it out,

11:01.760 --> 11:05.680
right? And then so the morning I was like, look, this is going to come out. You have a chance to

11:05.680 --> 11:12.080
give a comment. Like it's, it's happening, whether you like it or not. And for me, I had like two

11:12.080 --> 11:17.760
things. One of them was like, okay, well, how do I, I just went in damage control, right? Like,

11:17.760 --> 11:22.720
I mean, I've, I'm building stuff that I really believe in. I've been wanting to build this for

11:22.720 --> 11:27.520
like eight years. I've been like super stealthy about it for all sorts of reasons for security

11:27.520 --> 11:34.240
reasons, for, you know, IP reasons and so on. And, you know, everything was at risk, right? Not only

11:34.240 --> 11:38.640
the movement, the yak movement and hope, well, hopefully the movement is not at risk, but it's

11:38.640 --> 11:43.280
supposed to be anti fragile. We're trying to make it so, but and, and my company. So I went in damage

11:43.280 --> 11:48.720
control mode. And I didn't want to talk to them, but then they were like, look, this is going to

11:48.720 --> 11:53.120
really come out. I'm like, all right, well, I better try to control the narrative, at least for the

11:53.120 --> 11:57.440
first, for this first thing, because I'm sure they're going to pile on now. The media is definitely

11:57.440 --> 12:02.320
going to pile up from here on. I mean, I can I've entered an exhibit, let it let it be entered

12:02.320 --> 12:13.280
into the record, exhibit a okay, this is from datajournalism.com. Okay, by one of the wokest wokes

12:13.280 --> 12:18.320
to ever woke. One of the three heads, one of the heads on the three headed dragon, I would say.

12:18.320 --> 12:23.600
Yeah, exactly. I mean, it's a multi had the thing is every one of these critters, like basically

12:24.320 --> 12:31.360
is essentially a Stasi officer. That's what these, these folks are. So they actually have

12:31.920 --> 12:37.600
a whole article at datajournalism.com. And what this is actually titled, if you I'm sure if you

12:37.600 --> 12:44.080
paste this into chat, GPT or whatever and ask it to paraphrase it is how to docs. Okay, investigating

12:44.080 --> 12:50.000
social, go ahead. No, I'm just shocked. I'm, I shouldn't be shocked, but I I've never seen it

12:50.000 --> 12:55.280
this explicit. It's this explicit, right? All of their stuff. That's why I read all of their, you

12:55.280 --> 13:00.240
know, or go ahead. Brandy works for I think NBC, right? This works. That's right. Here we go.

13:00.800 --> 13:04.000
This is these are, these are major significant journalists who are,

13:04.000 --> 13:09.760
Yes, that's right. And they teach how to docs, how to, there's other articles on how to

13:09.760 --> 13:14.560
essentially assassinate, except they don't assassinate the character assassinate, right?

13:14.560 --> 13:19.280
And it's all so, you know, once in a while, they'll actually admit it when they're talking

13:19.280 --> 13:25.440
to each other and they put on a different face, right? So here it's like, you know,

13:26.400 --> 13:31.120
be prepared to read thousands of tweets, click until the end of the Google results and dive down

13:31.120 --> 13:34.960
to social media rabbit hole. If you want to collect the tiny biographical clues, they'll help you

13:34.960 --> 13:41.120
answer the question, who is this? Okay, so, you know, I mean, whatever you can read this if you

13:41.120 --> 13:46.720
want. The useful thing about reading articles like that is it tells us as technologists how to

13:46.720 --> 13:55.120
build a privacy countermeasures against these people who are literally like a like a for-profit

13:55.120 --> 14:00.400
intelligence agency. And I don't even say that lightly. How did they get your identity, GV,

14:00.400 --> 14:04.560
right? They, they went and used like some CIA voice recognition thing.

14:05.760 --> 14:10.240
Straight up. I mean, that, I guess that's, that makes it, that makes me a bit more badass that

14:10.240 --> 14:14.880
they had to do that. I don't think it was necessarily that hard, but I thought there was a

14:14.880 --> 14:21.600
sort of like ethical protection, like the way like, I'm not doing anything illegal. I'm literally just

14:22.160 --> 14:28.240
arguing for free speech. Hey guys, thanks for listening to the Pirate Wires pod. Make sure

14:28.240 --> 14:33.440
you like, subscribe, comment below and share this with your friends. I have failed. Honestly,

14:33.440 --> 14:37.280
that was one of the big things I thought while I was watching this go down, I thought like, have we

14:37.280 --> 14:41.920
not, and biology, you two, we both, you failed, you know, like, how do you, I don't know why you're

14:42.000 --> 14:45.760
talking to them. Like that's what I'm thinking. I'm like, how do you, we've been talking about this

14:45.760 --> 14:52.480
for years. Like they are not all of them. And maybe, I'll just, I maybe disagree a little bit

14:52.480 --> 14:57.440
something. I think there's some good things out there. It's very clear in my opinion who are not,

14:57.440 --> 15:01.040
and it's very clear usually by their approach, like that was not a friendly approach. That's a

15:01.040 --> 15:05.680
hostile, at that point, you're a war. And what you, what you do, and this is for people listening

15:05.680 --> 15:10.320
now who are maybe anonymous online, and they don't know what to do if this comes and happens to them,

15:11.040 --> 15:18.080
you ask for help from people like us who are, who are able to be back with media who can defend

15:18.080 --> 15:24.400
you. Like that, that is the very, who really separate from defense publicly is like, like advice,

15:24.400 --> 15:31.840
because by participating, you, first of all, they're using that against you. They're saying,

15:31.840 --> 15:35.760
oh, he participated. It wasn't against his will or whatever. And it's very clear from the emails

15:35.760 --> 15:40.240
that you've shared with me, and the private messages that they sent, you know, to other people

15:40.240 --> 15:43.440
and things like that's not obviously not the case. It was clear just reading the piece that

15:43.440 --> 15:47.680
wasn't the case, but I can confirm here officially that that is not the case. You were definitely

15:48.560 --> 15:52.400
not forced to participate, but you were going to be doxxed, whether or not you liked it.

15:53.200 --> 15:56.960
But had you not participated, they wouldn't have had that weapon to use against you.

15:56.960 --> 16:03.760
And they wouldn't have had much to talk about, because you, they also had not, yes, they were,

16:03.760 --> 16:07.680
they had, they used their CI voice recognition. They really, really thought it was you, you know,

16:07.680 --> 16:12.560
mathematically, whatever seemed like almost certain, but you had not actually confirmed it.

16:12.560 --> 16:16.560
So they would have had a story where it was like, we are very, very certain, but we don't know for

16:16.560 --> 16:24.320
sure. And also, he is sort of associated with this guy who we're telling the world is a Nazi.

16:24.320 --> 16:30.240
And that would have been so ludicrous that, I mean, we would have just gone, the whole internet

16:30.240 --> 16:33.520
would have exploded and been furious. And they would have been beaten back. Like,

16:34.720 --> 16:38.800
you kind of gave them a little bit, a little bit too much in the future. I mean, I wonder what

16:38.800 --> 16:44.560
Bolliger's advice is, but I'm like, you give them nothing. And you then concoct, you doxx yourself

16:44.560 --> 16:49.760
at that point, possibly, to take away the story. Like, I don't know, Bolliger, what would the advice

16:49.760 --> 16:56.240
have been you think in that situation? Well, so one thing is, I usually don't even repeat their

16:56.240 --> 17:01.360
charges, because they throw around, everybody's, you know, everybody's a Nazi, like they'll call

17:01.360 --> 17:04.800
anybody an everybody a Nazi, right? So I don't even give any credence to their charges, right?

17:05.840 --> 17:10.000
But setting that aside, yeah, I mean, so I mean, here's the thing, I like,

17:12.400 --> 17:16.240
how do I think about it? You're playing, you guys are really video games?

17:17.280 --> 17:22.560
Yeah, not enough to this reference, but let's just do it. So there's like, you know, there's

17:22.640 --> 17:26.880
various video games where they're like, you know, first person shooters or something like that.

17:26.880 --> 17:33.440
And new guys just keep beaming into the arena. Oh, right. They have no context on what just

17:33.440 --> 17:39.360
happened and where the, you know, shells are flying overhead and so on. And that's how I think about

17:39.360 --> 17:44.400
the new guys who, you know, maybe they're heads down, maybe maybe they were just like in a different

17:44.400 --> 17:47.680
part of the battlefield, they don't have context and they're, you know, beaming into the arena.

17:48.320 --> 17:53.040
And it's a good analogy, I think, right? Where it's like, you know, they're on our team,

17:53.040 --> 17:57.840
they just beamed in, but they, you know, they may not know all the battle tactics or whatever,

17:57.840 --> 18:03.120
right? So it's actually incumbent upon us as I hate, at least, you know,

18:03.120 --> 18:08.320
Solana, I'm not sure what the convention is, but I guess I've become a little bit of an elder.

18:08.320 --> 18:11.680
God help me. God help us all. You're seeing your in school.

18:12.400 --> 18:16.960
Yeah, it happens really fast. The gray comes really, really, really fast. I'll tell you that.

18:16.960 --> 18:24.880
Okay. But it is incumbent upon us to literally compact this stuff down into monthras that people

18:24.880 --> 18:30.960
repeat. And you assume it's almost like college where there's like a new class and it's obsolete

18:30.960 --> 18:34.880
in two years or three years. And you have to like say it again and update it, right?

18:35.440 --> 18:38.400
So that's, that's one part of it. Let me pause there and get your thoughts.

18:39.920 --> 18:44.560
Well, I mean, I agree. I really, like I said, at the top of this little piece here, I felt

18:44.560 --> 18:48.880
bad guilt. I felt like I had not done a good enough. It's loud as I have been on this issue.

18:48.880 --> 18:52.720
It's awesome. I've written about it as much as I've tweeted about it. I feel like somehow that

18:52.720 --> 18:56.400
message, it's like, do people think I'm kidding around? Do they think that I mean, this is

18:57.040 --> 19:03.680
in information war? And I again, I do believe there are good actors out there. There are

19:03.680 --> 19:09.120
so many nefarious actors. This for me, the Alex Conrad piece is really crazy because so many people

19:09.120 --> 19:17.440
treat him like a reasonable reporter in tech. And this action for me is beyond the pale.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.840
Not only the way he went after you, but the way he tried to go after Gary and Mark through you

19:23.600 --> 19:30.560
is, I think, really nefarious. And I'm like frustrated that people aren't as upset about

19:30.560 --> 19:34.720
that piece as I am. But yeah, I know I agree. I think we do have a little bit of a better job

19:34.720 --> 19:42.480
reaching out in these moments. And I don't know, it's like, do I, I just hope that people know

19:42.480 --> 19:50.240
that they can hit up people like us for advice in these situations? There are a lot of great people

19:50.240 --> 19:56.160
online. Lulu is another great person to Lulu. Messervie is a great person to talk to on this

19:56.160 --> 20:03.040
kind of stuff. I was saying, I wrote a piece about this. And in it towards the end, I get to the

20:03.040 --> 20:08.640
point where it's like, you actually, and this is what I really would love to talk about, things

20:08.640 --> 20:15.440
have changed. Yeah, there are a lot of people who are great online talking with big audiences.

20:15.440 --> 20:21.360
And it's not just like they're anonymous people, there are pseudonymous, pseudonymous, I cannot

20:21.360 --> 20:28.560
ever pronounce it, semi anonymous people. There are CEOs, big, huge, popular public CEOs who are

20:28.560 --> 20:33.680
posting, and they are all just like a DM away. And you can see on Twitter, you can see who's

20:33.680 --> 20:37.040
connected to who, like if you don't know them directly, you want some advice, you talk to

20:37.040 --> 20:45.600
anyone, it's pretty cool. The vibe has shifted somewhat. And I was just watching the Reagan

20:45.600 --> 20:51.920
National Defense Forum. This is like the Super Bowl for defense forums. You have, first of all,

20:52.320 --> 20:56.960
last week you had Elon Musk telling the advertisers to go fuck themselves

20:58.400 --> 21:01.920
on the stage of the New York Times. Then this weekend at the Reagan Forum,

21:02.560 --> 21:08.720
you have Palmer Lucky sort of telling kids not to follow their stupid dreams. If they're, you know,

21:09.760 --> 21:17.200
contra reason and self-defeating or not good for society. It was like a very sort of anti,

21:17.200 --> 21:21.520
I don't know, mainstream message. It was strange to see him up there being so honest and

21:21.520 --> 21:26.160
unapologetic. And Palmer, someone specifically who just lays down his opinion every day and

21:26.160 --> 21:30.320
does not give a fuck and has really gone direct in that way with his own message about his own

21:30.320 --> 21:39.280
company, which is killing it, by the way. Onderal. Then you have Alex Karp, who just espouses like

21:39.280 --> 21:44.320
an incredibly anti-woke message openly on stage and is like, I'm not hiring people who are idiots

21:44.320 --> 21:48.880
on the following topics, all of which would have been considered beyond the pale just three years

21:48.880 --> 21:53.440
ago, would have been articles in the New York Times about, you know, the terrifying menace of Alex

21:53.440 --> 21:58.400
Karp. But I am running one of the coolest companies in the world. And I'm telling young people,

21:58.400 --> 22:06.000
you are breathing the vapors of a dangerous, new, fake and self-destructive religion when you are

22:06.000 --> 22:11.360
sitting at your elite school pretending because you watched TikTok twice and got an A plus on some

22:11.360 --> 22:15.920
crazy paper because your professor couldn't get a job anywhere else that you actually understand

22:15.920 --> 22:24.960
the world. And you're not welcome at my company. I think things are different now. I don't know,

22:24.960 --> 22:28.640
what do you got? Am I right? Am I wrong? Am I just naive, optimistic, too hopeful?

22:29.760 --> 22:35.600
Well, yeah, I mean, so, you know, Solana, you and I, again, we're like literally grizzled combat

22:35.600 --> 22:42.000
veterans at this point, 10, 10 years in the meme wars, right? Yeah. And last five is really,

22:42.000 --> 22:45.280
I think, where most of the action took place. That's right. That's right. So basically,

22:46.960 --> 22:52.880
you know, tech versus media, you know, I kind of, all right, I'm just going to rattle off the history

22:52.880 --> 22:58.720
here. And then I'll be turning this into a blog post and so on and so forth with the rules and

22:58.720 --> 23:04.880
the history and then the history history, the deep history, right? But very roughly, tech kind of

23:04.960 --> 23:09.040
arguably, you can argue when tech exists as a culture, but maybe you date it to

23:09.680 --> 23:18.880
95 with the graphical web browser, okay? And then from 95 till, you know, 2008 or so,

23:19.760 --> 23:25.120
because of the dot com crash, media didn't even really take tech seriously. They're just like

23:25.120 --> 23:30.080
gadget guys or what have you just doing their stuff on the West Coast and they were considered

23:30.080 --> 23:36.400
basically an auxiliary of the Democrat Party, like you had, you know, unions and you had this group

23:36.400 --> 23:40.560
and that group and then there were Steve Jobs and the tech guys making gadgets over there in the

23:40.560 --> 23:45.840
corner over there. And media concerned themselves with their expense accounts and the rock and all

23:45.840 --> 23:51.760
this other stuff going up into 2008. There's even this article at that time, I think by Joel Stein,

23:51.760 --> 23:56.320
that's enumerating like the power centers of the USA and it's real time capsule from 2008,

23:56.320 --> 24:00.400
because you know it's not on there. What's on there is a Pentagon and Wall Street and so on.

24:00.400 --> 24:08.080
You know it's not on there. In 98? 2008. 2008, what's, oh, social media. Silicon Valley is not on

24:08.080 --> 24:17.200
there as a power center in 2008. At all. At all. Yeah, that is, the phrase big tech had not even

24:17.200 --> 24:23.280
been innovated at that point. Exactly. This whole system that we're in is so much more recent than

24:23.280 --> 24:27.840
people think because what happened was after 2008, after the financial crisis,

24:29.920 --> 24:38.080
tech revenues went vertical. Okay. There's a great graphic that shows what happened. All right.

24:38.080 --> 24:44.800
Bam. Okay. The hate is Kazanus. What is this graph? This is showing print media revenue top set at

24:44.800 --> 24:50.400
$67 billion in year 2000. Then it's like down after the dotcom crash, but it's flat ish.

24:50.400 --> 24:57.440
And then a complete collapse down to like $16 billion in like 400 years. This is advertising

24:57.440 --> 25:01.200
revenue in newspapers. Advertising revenue in newspapers is a blue line, right? And then

25:01.200 --> 25:05.520
including digital, digital doesn't save them, doesn't come on fast enough. And Google eats their

25:05.520 --> 25:09.280
lunch and then Facebook eats their lunch. That's a green line over here. Google is the red line.

25:09.280 --> 25:16.240
All right. So basically it's one thing to, you know, see your neighbor become like a billionaire.

25:16.240 --> 25:19.440
It's quite another thing for them to become a billionaire while you become

25:20.720 --> 25:26.960
a thousandaire or whatever. Right. Okay. And so these guys essentially over the first four years

25:26.960 --> 25:32.000
of the Obama administration saw these tech guys who had been in, you know, a box or whatever,

25:32.000 --> 25:38.160
they didn't think of as anything, suddenly rock it up ridiculously fast. And because that was the

25:38.960 --> 25:43.360
iPhone and that was the reallocation of budgets after the financial crisis to online ads,

25:43.440 --> 25:49.120
which are finally mature and converting. That was the fact that like SaaS was starting to work.

25:49.120 --> 25:54.000
Y Combinator actually, you know, remember Y Combinator started in 2005, that whole modern

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
seed era of things only really started working in the late 2000s. There are a bunch of great

25:58.000 --> 26:03.840
companies found around that time, Stripe, Airbnb, Uber, all of that basically by 2013,

26:04.640 --> 26:09.920
after Obama got reelected, even in 2012, by the way, do you guys remember in 2012,

26:09.920 --> 26:14.320
the nerds go marching in? How a dream team of engineers from Facebook, Twitter and Google

26:14.320 --> 26:19.760
built the software that drove Barack Obama's re-election. Okay, when the nerds go marching in.

26:19.760 --> 26:23.840
You see that? Yeah, I remember that narrative of the Obama being the first sort of internet

26:23.840 --> 26:29.600
president. He had this team around him from tech basically. That's right. Not fully believing it,

26:29.600 --> 26:36.800
but. Well, and the reason for that is because, you know, Facebook and then Twitter started in

26:36.800 --> 26:43.520
very blue zones in the Harvard area and in San Francisco. And so it was assumed that technology

26:44.080 --> 26:49.280
was blue and blue was tech and that it was just good and that if it had any effect on politics,

26:49.280 --> 26:53.600
it would be to overthrow oppressive regimes and overthrow, you know, cause the Arab Spring. Go

26:53.600 --> 26:58.080
ahead. Right. That was just assumed until Arab Spring, which they thought was great. We don't

26:58.080 --> 27:02.720
hear much about the sort of consequences of that today. A lot of disasters, a lot of people

27:02.800 --> 27:07.760
dead unfortunately, right? So we can come back to that point, but basically what happened then

27:07.760 --> 27:13.840
from 2012 to 2016, a bunch of things happened. First is all these conservatives started getting

27:13.840 --> 27:18.720
Android phones. Okay. And there's a really interesting sort of meme that makes this

27:18.720 --> 27:23.200
concrete. If you're seeing, and this is kind of late 2010s, starting to get a little obsolete or

27:23.200 --> 27:30.160
whatever, right? But there's a, there's a collage of a bunch of Democrat visages and a bunch of

27:30.160 --> 27:38.080
Republican visages on Twitter. So Democrat visages are guys with glasses indoors and like,

27:38.080 --> 27:43.040
you know, kind of unshaven or whatever, right? They're like unshaven programmer, graphic designer,

27:43.040 --> 27:47.920
Yasqueen types or whatever, you know, the guys pointing at the thing, right? Okay. And

27:49.760 --> 27:53.600
but the Republicans are more interesting or this is like, it's an interesting different kind of

27:53.600 --> 28:00.080
visage. They're people with sunglasses in trucks outdoors, taking selfies on their phone.

28:01.680 --> 28:05.920
So the fundamental difference is the Democrats are indoors and Republicans are outdoors.

28:07.120 --> 28:11.200
Because almost all the Republicans are in sunglasses and they're clearly on the go,

28:11.200 --> 28:15.840
with some like cheapo Android phone. So part of what happened from 2012 to 2016 is the

28:15.840 --> 28:19.760
polls got online and that started shifting Twitter and the internet to the right. The

28:19.760 --> 28:25.360
other thing that happened is after Obama got reelected in 2012, the media, which had played

28:25.360 --> 28:29.440
nice with tech guys because they needed them to get Obama to get reelected, now had four years to

28:29.440 --> 28:35.280
settle scores. And all the knives came out and all the valleywag type stuff happened around that time.

28:35.280 --> 28:38.880
Would you just look at all those rich people? That's valleywags editorial vision in nutshell,

28:38.880 --> 28:43.840
but could be so much more by Monju, who's become a full communist now and radicalized, right?

28:43.840 --> 28:48.320
But that was like 10 years ago when he was ostensibly central left, he was complaining about

28:48.320 --> 28:54.080
attacking them as rich people and so on and so forth. That's crazy. I remember people being mad

28:54.080 --> 28:58.240
about that. But in my mind, I remember Dave Moore and complaining about this, which made sense

28:58.240 --> 29:03.760
because he was being attacked. I don't remember the press rising to the defense of those guys.

29:03.760 --> 29:08.240
That's interesting. That's right. So basically a few years later, he's all abolished billionaires.

29:08.240 --> 29:12.480
It's literally he's writing that. Okay. The radicalization happened to the journals.

29:12.960 --> 29:22.400
Okay. And essentially, though, it was a boxer's clinch where that tech and media alliance didn't

29:22.400 --> 29:27.360
make sense anymore because the media guys were like, wait a second, these tech guys aren't just

29:27.360 --> 29:33.120
like some vote bank gadget bank, whatever that's making the the bejeweled toaster on my desk that

29:33.120 --> 29:39.040
is an iMac, they're coming for everything. Yeah. And then toothless really. I mean, it was

29:39.840 --> 29:45.200
Gawker is destroyed. Yeah. That was that comes that comes a little bit later. But yes, that's

29:45.200 --> 29:49.280
right. That's right. Of course, it's an important episode. And then trouble wins the election. And

29:49.280 --> 29:56.400
at that point, it's worse. That's right. But crucially, the negative coverage starts in 2013.

29:56.400 --> 30:01.200
In 2012, you can even find them writing articles like there's no such thing as a brogram or and

30:01.200 --> 30:06.800
so on. Right. So this goes back to that visual I had of the blue tribe, right, red tribe,

30:06.800 --> 30:11.680
gray tribe, if you're part of the tribe, you get friendly coverage. If you are not part of the tribe,

30:11.680 --> 30:16.960
it's information warfare. Yeah. Right. And now that can mean by the way, you can be part of the

30:16.960 --> 30:20.960
tribe and then kicked out of the tribe or you can choose to leave like Glenn Greenwald has,

30:21.680 --> 30:26.240
you know, he was he was like, he had all the prizes. That's why I give him a lot. I don't

30:26.240 --> 30:31.360
agree with Glenn on every issue. But I respect him because he had all the prizes within blue and

30:31.360 --> 30:35.840
decided to kind of go and do his own thing and stand for a principle that he stood for. Right.

30:35.920 --> 30:40.320
Conversely, it is also possible for someone to be kind of a renegade,

30:40.320 --> 30:47.280
but then to become incorporated into blue and to be part of this Borg, right. Like Google,

30:47.280 --> 30:53.840
early Google was much more buccaneering and swashbuckling and so on than what's become,

30:53.840 --> 30:59.760
which it's not as blue as it was like a few years ago, maybe, but it's pretty blue, right.

30:59.760 --> 31:05.520
So so once you kind of have that visual, it's really the, you know, that's the friend enemy

31:05.520 --> 31:11.600
of the tribal distinction. And it's not exactly left, right, or what have you. It is group non-group.

31:12.240 --> 31:16.480
Let me pause there. I've got a lot more. Well, I want to, I mean, I have a slight pushback,

31:16.480 --> 31:22.000
which is that I agree with, I mean, the whole history, I think is correct and insightful,

31:22.000 --> 31:28.560
especially the piece on the revenue is really important. It's, you know, we, I think I maybe

31:28.560 --> 31:35.040
get somewhat distracted sometimes by the ideological combat component of all this. It just very

31:35.040 --> 31:39.520
clearly feels to me like a classic information war and maybe not classic. It's not classic. It's

31:39.520 --> 31:43.920
new. It's a new kind of, it's a very scaled up information war. It's live. It happens every

31:43.920 --> 31:49.840
day. It lives in our pocket. It never ends. But at the end of the day, like we are, and this is a

31:49.840 --> 31:55.440
point that is, you know, I've heard before I just forget, it's like we're in cop, we're competitive.

31:55.440 --> 31:59.040
We're competitive. There's a business piece that's competitive, like just hot, like industries are

31:59.040 --> 32:04.240
competing. And then online, that I think the new thing that we've seen over the past few years,

32:04.240 --> 32:10.480
and let's just focus on tech for a moment, is we're not just, it's not just a money issue. Like

32:10.480 --> 32:19.680
it's an actual, the all in pod is a massive success. And that is, you know, a side project for David

32:19.680 --> 32:26.160
Sacks. And that would be a dream come true for every single person in media. So it's not like the

32:26.160 --> 32:30.000
platforms are taking the money. It's like the people on the platforms are also taking the

32:30.000 --> 32:34.080
attention from them. They're not even, they don't even get to be the attention people anymore.

32:34.080 --> 32:38.720
Or not exclusively, there's combat, there's competition there. So separate from the ideological

32:38.720 --> 32:43.440
piece, there's just, there's the reality of just competition. And when you're in it with someone

32:43.440 --> 32:48.160
for something that you consider your life. So it's, it's funny you say this, because, you know,

32:48.160 --> 32:53.040
now again, this feels like an ancient, actually, GV, I want you to jump in because we were just

32:53.040 --> 32:58.880
chatting. So, did you want to say something or? Yeah, yeah, there's kind of the broader,

32:59.600 --> 33:04.880
there's the broader informational war between tech and, and, you know, the paper built

33:04.880 --> 33:09.600
aligned media. But, you know, the media, they're kind of the pit bull for, for some of the,

33:10.560 --> 33:16.720
the paper belt against, you know, whoever in tech is an enemy of whoever is like helping place

33:16.720 --> 33:22.320
various stories. You know, to me, it's been like, I've been trying to like figure out like trying

33:22.320 --> 33:28.480
to back propagate, why did this happen to me? Like, where did I cross the threshold of becoming

33:28.480 --> 33:35.200
enough of a problem that they needed to have leverage over me and expose me? And, I mean,

33:35.200 --> 33:41.360
obviously, you know, Mark and Gary have been supportive of the movement, you know, for all

33:41.360 --> 33:46.480
sorts of reasons, one of which is like, obviously, we think that, you know, the current sort of

33:46.480 --> 33:54.000
regulatory capture attempt by, you know, AI safety, the AI safety complex and some of the big incumbents,

33:54.720 --> 34:00.400
you know, it's camouflage is like anti-doom, trying to, trying to save us, you know, trying

34:00.400 --> 34:05.040
to, trying to save us from open source models, right? Their dual use and so on. And, you know,

34:05.040 --> 34:09.600
we were calling that out and getting, getting people fired up, calling this out and it became a

34:09.600 --> 34:16.240
problem. And of course, you know, Gary tweeted this that, you know, FTC chair, Lena Khan,

34:17.200 --> 34:20.720
was invited to YC, you know, and I was there and we had a little chat.

34:20.800 --> 34:25.680
And, you know, I've voiced, I've voiced our concern of our, the concerns of our community,

34:25.680 --> 34:30.480
that like, hey, actually, this is, this is, you know, kind of some of the big incumbents kind of

34:30.480 --> 34:36.240
covering up the fact that they're trying to capture the market with sort of like, oh, this is for

34:36.240 --> 34:41.920
your own, your own safety. And that's when I became like officially a political problem, right? And,

34:41.920 --> 34:46.480
you know, there's all sorts of interests in the background, you know, trying to pull strings

34:46.480 --> 34:52.000
here. You know, I have some hypotheses, maybe I won't go into like exactly who I think is pulling

34:52.000 --> 34:56.560
the strings. I have my, I have my thoughts on that. But what, what's been public is that, you

34:56.560 --> 35:04.800
know, Secretary Ramondo, I believe, called out EX specifically as like a dangerous movement and

35:04.800 --> 35:12.560
something we should suppress with AI. They want to, like our movement is about free speech,

35:12.640 --> 35:17.760
freedom of compute, freedom of AI and not like top down oppression aided with AI. And they're

35:17.760 --> 35:22.880
literally proposing shutting us down with AI, which proves our point, which is kind of like,

35:22.880 --> 35:27.040
by the way, by the way, you know, that's like, it's like, well, nobody rid me of this meddlesome

35:27.040 --> 35:33.680
priest kind of thing, right? Well, no one rid me of this meddlesome EAC, right? Like EAC is a problem.

35:33.680 --> 35:38.480
And that's like a decentralized signal to the journals to go in, you know, right? It's stochastic

35:38.480 --> 35:45.360
journalism. Yes. Come on, that's pretty good. Right? No, I agree. Yeah, you're holding up the

35:45.360 --> 35:49.680
target. This is where I'm trying to think of what the illusion to stochastic terrorism. Okay,

35:49.680 --> 35:54.400
I thought it was funny. Stochastic journalism, stochastic terrorism. Okay, I want to talk about

35:55.120 --> 36:00.960
it was funny. I want to talk about EAC. You were just getting into it. I mean, what

36:02.800 --> 36:05.440
this is a little bit off topic, and we can, you know, revisit any of the stuff that we just talked

36:05.440 --> 36:14.640
about, there's a ton there on the war piece. But this, you know, it's dangerous and whatnot.

36:16.240 --> 36:19.360
What is EAC? How would you even describe it?

36:20.960 --> 36:29.200
What is EAC? I think for me, it's kind of like a cultural framework, really, or a

36:29.200 --> 36:33.520
medical cultural framework. We're trying to understand, where's this whole thing going?

36:33.600 --> 36:37.440
Where's civilization going, you know, from first principles? At the end of the day,

36:37.440 --> 36:43.680
the only laws are the laws of physics. And I'm a former theoretical physicist, and, you know,

36:43.680 --> 36:50.160
I do physics based AI now. You know, I always think about physics. And nowadays, I think about

36:50.160 --> 36:55.760
self organizing systems. And, you know, to me, it was just an exercise in writing and trying to

36:55.760 --> 37:01.760
understand where it's all going. And rather than have like, like completely, like,

37:03.680 --> 37:08.400
unanchored to reality sort of theories, like, like the doomers do of like, AI taking over,

37:08.400 --> 37:12.320
as soon as it reaches human level AI, it takes over and fooms and takes over the planet. Like,

37:12.320 --> 37:16.480
I've been trying to actually find like, where's this thing going? It's like, okay, well,

37:18.080 --> 37:24.240
you know, civilization at the end of the day is a system that's like alive. All systems that are

37:24.320 --> 37:30.560
alive, or that are basically life from a physics standpoint, seek to grow, they acquire energy

37:30.560 --> 37:35.440
to maintain their sort of state, and they seek to grow and increase their ability to acquire

37:35.440 --> 37:39.600
free energy. It's like, okay, well, civilization wants to go up the what is called the Kardashev

37:39.600 --> 37:45.600
scale. So it is the scale of energy production or consumption. And so that's where we're going,

37:45.600 --> 37:51.600
you know, and that's where the system wants to go. And, you know, it keeps morphing itself,

37:51.600 --> 37:56.000
it, you know, searches over the space of technologies, of cultures, of memes, of

37:56.000 --> 38:04.960
genetics, of everything, in order to ascend this scale. And, you know, basically, it's like,

38:04.960 --> 38:11.120
we're just pointing that out. And to us, like, like, it's first a framework of like, what is,

38:11.120 --> 38:15.200
and, you know, that's what's going on. And then it's like, how should you live your life,

38:15.200 --> 38:19.920
given this fact? It's like, well, actually, if you help the growth of civilization,

38:20.640 --> 38:27.600
you know, you will likely prosper. And it's kind of a self fulfilling prophecy. If you're

38:27.600 --> 38:32.640
optimistic about the future, you work on hard things, right, because you believe in a better

38:32.640 --> 38:39.040
future. So you want to contribute it to it so that you own a piece of it. And, and then you go out

38:39.040 --> 38:43.920
and build and do hard things. And then the good future happens. Whereas if like you believe in

38:43.920 --> 38:48.800
doom, and nothing good is going to happen, you know, a longer build, you don't longer want to

38:48.800 --> 38:53.280
have kids, you don't bet on the future. And then the future is actually worse. Right. And to us,

38:53.280 --> 39:00.320
it was a sort of reaction to the pervasive demerism, and the the person pervasive pessimism,

39:00.320 --> 39:07.200
tech pessimism, that was just dominating the news cycles. And we were like, can we have a viral,

39:07.200 --> 39:14.960
optimism movement that, you know, hyperstitiously induces growth of civilization, right? Don't

39:14.960 --> 39:18.560
we all want that? Don't we all want to be, you know, amongst the stars?

39:19.360 --> 39:25.120
It's more no, that's the thing. No, that's actually, I mean, for us, us three, yes. But

39:25.120 --> 39:29.040
that's actually like a core. Yeah, it's not different. It's, yeah.

39:29.680 --> 39:33.440
Acke, obviously ACC, we're talking about acceleration is the word that you're using. It's

39:33.440 --> 39:40.720
EA, you're making a play on effective altruism. The effective altruists are very concerned with

39:40.960 --> 39:47.040
accidentally building a god that kills us, really, is like where their heads at. And they,

39:47.920 --> 39:51.360
not just they, now you have the safetyists in the media who have, they want to slow down tech

39:51.360 --> 39:56.480
for all sorts of reasons. But their position, all of them in this sort of uneasy alliance between

39:56.480 --> 40:02.640
very smart people in AI who happen to be EA-pilled and a little bit of a doomer, and the press,

40:02.640 --> 40:07.120
and, you know, the government that wants to slow all this shit down. It's, it is that it's slowing

40:07.120 --> 40:11.840
things down. Endlessly in the process, especially you hear, you know, Mark Zuckerberg said, move

40:11.840 --> 40:16.240
fast and break things. And then things broke. We have to move more slowly. And you're not saying

40:16.240 --> 40:20.960
that you're saying we need to accelerate. So the positive vision is there. It's awesome. And I

40:20.960 --> 40:24.720
thank you for your service, sir. It is very important. The memes are excellent. And I think,

40:24.720 --> 40:28.640
I agree, they are powerful. I think they're motivating. I think they are helpful. But they

40:29.440 --> 40:37.120
identified correctly your critique of them. And, and so that is, you know, you're, you're locked

40:37.120 --> 40:41.840
in a sort of at that point, it's, if people hate you a lot, and I mean, I've seen it. Why,

40:41.840 --> 40:46.880
how much they hated you until this week? They're definitely mad. Can I make, can I make a couple

40:46.880 --> 40:53.680
points there? Yeah. So there are decelerationists. And there's also what the current US establishment

40:53.680 --> 41:00.320
is, which are stagnationists, right? What they want to do is they're in their own way, conservatives,

41:00.320 --> 41:06.560
where they want to freeze the world in amber. And so you will find, for example,

41:08.480 --> 41:15.440
that, you know, for example, Raimondo is talking about the tariffs and so on and export controls.

41:15.440 --> 41:20.000
And they want to kind of freeze China as a power. And actually, I can understand that. Okay.

41:20.800 --> 41:25.280
But, and so they're like, Oh, you know, the US needs to be a leader in AI. So we're going to ban

41:25.280 --> 41:31.040
exports in there. And then literally, you know, that's what they're saying on Mondays and Thursdays.

41:31.040 --> 41:36.880
And then on Tuesdays and Fridays, they're doing AI bans in the US and saying, you need to slow down

41:36.880 --> 41:41.840
and not accelerate and so on and so forth, right? So they want to kind of think they think they can

41:41.840 --> 41:47.200
be a policy lovers, which, you know, they're not Silicon Valley, they're not Shenzhen,

41:47.280 --> 41:51.760
you know, they're neither of these things. But Washington DC thinks they can freeze the current

41:51.760 --> 41:56.960
dispensation in amber, where they've got a healthy lead, and nobody abroad, and nobody at home goes

41:56.960 --> 42:02.800
too fast. And nobody, they just want to stop the disruption. Because that's the thing. Acceleration

42:04.320 --> 42:06.960
is good for lots of people, but it's not good for them.

42:06.960 --> 42:10.720
It's not good for power, any technological innovation, I think, pretty much.

42:10.720 --> 42:15.280
Well, so that's the thing. So I've got it. I've got a perspective on this being out here in Asia,

42:15.280 --> 42:22.560
right? And India loves tech. India loves tech. And the reason Indians love tech is, you know,

42:22.560 --> 42:28.480
you've got a guy who was on a, you know, like a very poor 10 years ago, who's now got an Android

42:28.480 --> 42:32.080
phone, and they've got a lifeline to the world, and they're able to study and they can earn and

42:32.080 --> 42:36.720
all this stuff. So it is correlated with the massive improvement in their living standards,

42:36.720 --> 42:41.360
right? But for the journals, and more generally, the US establishment, you saw that graph, it's

42:41.360 --> 42:46.000
correlated with a massive decrease in their living standards. So they have a learned correlation

42:46.000 --> 42:51.200
where the faster the tech grows, the less money they have, the less power they have,

42:51.200 --> 42:56.800
which is kind of true for, you know, it would be extremely painful for you, right? Acceleration

42:56.800 --> 43:02.720
is extremely painful for them, right? And so that's why they're fighting the internet,

43:02.720 --> 43:07.520
and they're fighting every force that's against them, in actually a conservative way.

43:07.840 --> 43:11.440
Always feels like this. And then in this case, you're talking about generative, obviously,

43:11.440 --> 43:16.800
as many things, but the thing that the most attention at this point is are the generative

43:16.800 --> 43:21.200
models when you're talking about like language specifically, this is something that it looks

43:21.200 --> 43:26.480
like a journalist that knows the true NPC level. It's literally the thing is, you know, this guy,

43:26.480 --> 43:30.800
I got to get this guy to put this project back up, which, you know, I used to say,

43:31.520 --> 43:37.040
not even jokingly that these journalists, you know, there are just like a sports article,

43:37.040 --> 43:41.280
it's a wrapper around a box score, you know, box score is like the, you know, how many rebounds,

43:41.280 --> 43:46.320
how many says steals, whatever, in a basketball game, or a financial article, it's a wrapper around

43:46.320 --> 43:50.240
a ticker, like, you know, stocks were up on heavy trading, blah, blah, blah, it's just like a verbal

43:50.240 --> 43:55.120
narrative. I used to say that these articles are just wrappers around tweets, you give it three

43:55.120 --> 43:59.600
tweets, and you can write the article. And I used to say that as a joke, you can go find,

43:59.600 --> 44:05.040
not even as joke, it's like true and also a joke, right? From like years before chat,

44:05.120 --> 44:11.120
GPT. And then when it came out, it became literally true, where you could paste in a few

44:11.120 --> 44:16.480
articles, like a single tweet into this thing that, you know, like a New York Times article

44:16.480 --> 44:21.360
generator, and that's probably gotten even better a year later, and generate an entire full NYT

44:21.360 --> 44:28.160
article that's like dark times ahead in technology as acceleration continues, you know, like you

44:28.160 --> 44:32.800
could literally do that, right? And there's no intelligence, it's totally paint by numbers,

44:32.800 --> 44:35.440
you just have the stylistic kind of thing off the prompt, go, go, go.

44:36.160 --> 44:41.440
Yeah, yeah, I think like the thing, the thing that's scary, right? It's kind of like the old

44:41.440 --> 44:46.160
world media, they serve the incumbents, they serve those that have interest in top down,

44:46.160 --> 44:51.920
sort of control, they like to like, they gain proxy power by being instrumental to

44:51.920 --> 44:57.760
authoritarians, right? And those that argue for more control. And IAC is about, like,

44:58.480 --> 45:03.280
saying that acceleration, techno capital acceleration is a positive force, it creates

45:03.280 --> 45:09.280
amazing technologies, it gives us wealth. And, you know, the counter argument to it is that,

45:09.280 --> 45:14.400
well, if we, if we don't control who and who ends up in power, that's, that's bad, you know,

45:14.400 --> 45:19.600
really what they're thinking is like, we might lose power. And so that is bad. But the reality is,

45:19.600 --> 45:25.600
like, the system would adapt and powers would shift to, you know, those that are disrupting

45:25.600 --> 45:31.440
the incumbents, right? And that's good. That's how the system, you know, optimizes itself and finds,

45:31.440 --> 45:36.560
you know, whichever technologies are most beneficial to the world and helps them scale

45:36.560 --> 45:41.680
up. And of course, those that are the produce those technologies get to have sort of more

45:41.680 --> 45:45.520
power to allocate capital and control where it goes, right? Which is the sort of natural

45:45.520 --> 45:50.080
meritocracy. And they're trying to break that they're trying to maintain the sort of status quo.

45:50.080 --> 45:53.600
They are the real conservatives, they call themselves maybe progressives in some cases,

45:53.600 --> 45:57.760
but they're really just trying to conserve the powers that be. And then the media, they're just

45:57.760 --> 46:03.280
mouthpieces for the incumbents. Because again, like, you know, those are the only people that

46:03.280 --> 46:09.360
still talk to them. And they use it like, you know, they use them as the media is kind of like

46:09.360 --> 46:15.600
an information warfare arm of like, you know, the incumbents and the pre-rebuilt, right? And we've

46:15.600 --> 46:20.240
seen that. Like, and the label, you know, go ahead. I worry a little bit. And I want to get both of

46:20.240 --> 46:28.400
you take on this. Unless you want to jump in a little bit, which is, you know, there's more I

46:28.400 --> 46:33.760
can say on kind of the history of this and so on. But there's a huge difference as to where we are in

46:33.760 --> 46:42.000
2023 versus where we are in 2019, 2020, 2021. And I think, Solana, you did your part. I think I did

46:42.000 --> 46:47.600
my own little part. We did our part, which go ahead, shakes, no handshakes. That was no handshakes,

46:47.600 --> 46:55.680
please. Exactly. Remember that? Yeah. Essentially, what happened was, starting in 2013, let me just

46:55.680 --> 47:03.040
recap the history that began and bring us to the present day. From 2013 to roughly, you know, 2020,

47:04.000 --> 47:10.000
the journals essentially began a reign of terror against tech, where there was all manner of

47:10.000 --> 47:15.360
cancellation. We didn't have the word for it then, against people large and small. That's why the

47:15.360 --> 47:18.640
homeless problem, which is not really a homeless problem, but a drug and mental illness problem is

47:18.640 --> 47:22.960
Sanjana Friedman, one of your, you have many talented writers, particularly talented writers,

47:22.960 --> 47:28.560
Sanjana Salute. Yes, she's good. All right. Is it she? She, yeah. Okay. Okay. Sorry. I didn't know

47:28.560 --> 47:35.280
what the, you know, what the, uh, we gotta be careful. Nameless. So, um, Sanjana Friedman has done

47:35.280 --> 47:39.920
a phenomenal job on documenting how the like the homeless problem, it's not just a homeless problem,

47:39.920 --> 47:45.840
it's a drug and mental illness problem. The point is, in the early 2010s, when something could have

47:45.840 --> 47:52.320
been done about it, there were a few tech guys who made in-politic comments about, you know, the

47:52.320 --> 47:58.800
sudden epidemic of needles and syringes and poop. This guy, Greg Gottman, another guy, Peter Shee,

47:58.800 --> 48:04.160
and yeah, maybe they posted in like, you know, maybe you might not use exactly that language,

48:04.240 --> 48:11.440
but obviously they're, you know, it's, it's, it's a lot less offensive than some crazy guy

48:11.440 --> 48:16.800
throwing feces at you in the street, right? And, and more importantly than the NGO who's

48:16.800 --> 48:22.400
feeding him drugs and getting paid by the city to do so, right? They mean things about the people

48:22.400 --> 48:28.320
who were chasing you down the block. Yeah, exactly. That's right. That's right. So, what happened was

48:28.320 --> 48:33.040
the journals at that time. Not necessarily. It's like, that was tech people turned on them. Well,

48:33.040 --> 48:37.200
well, but, but the reason was there's a bunch, if you go back and look, Peter Shee, Greg Gottman

48:37.200 --> 48:42.960
got destroyed by the media at that time. And then people queued off of that as, oh, that's what I'm

48:42.960 --> 48:48.160
supposed to, I'm supposed to yell at them, right? And so it became for years, it was incredibly

48:48.160 --> 48:53.360
un-PC to even mention the problems that San Francisco was happening. So it was like disabling

48:53.360 --> 48:58.480
the immune system during the period when it maybe could have done something more. And then this thing

48:58.480 --> 49:02.400
just got completely out of control and it became what it is now. And these NGOs became totally

49:02.400 --> 49:07.040
entrenched and so on. Many other kinds of things happened like that. That's just like one version,

49:07.040 --> 49:12.480
example of it, where the journalists caused a giant problem and then only after it became

49:12.480 --> 49:17.600
massive, then could it be acknowledged? It was interesting. I was nervous to write about local

49:17.600 --> 49:22.960
politics and I forget that sometimes, but like when I first started seriously writing in like 2020,

49:24.560 --> 49:29.280
I was nervous to touch the homeless issue and the drug issue. And I just thought like, this is,

49:29.280 --> 49:32.800
this feels dangerous, people are going to come after me, I don't care, I got to do it.

49:32.800 --> 49:39.760
And it doesn't feel that way now. It's a weird thing where I have, I always ask myself, is it

49:39.760 --> 49:43.680
because they're so strong or because they become weaker? And I think it's both at the same time.

49:43.680 --> 49:49.440
How they won, is that why they don't care anymore? Yeah, exactly. That's right. So I think it's both

49:49.440 --> 49:57.440
where the left, the Democrats, the blues, whatever, have captured the state and so they've got the

49:57.440 --> 50:02.560
budget. And so they sit in their parapets. And no matter what we see online, the money just

50:02.560 --> 50:07.520
keeps flowing to these NGOs, they flow to them or whatever, right? So we can yell and they can lull

50:07.520 --> 50:12.960
and then just go back to shipping syringes, right? But they have lost control of the network.

50:13.520 --> 50:19.680
And, you know, thanks Elon and thanks to also sub stack and, you know, Coinbase taking a stand and

50:19.680 --> 50:24.080
salon and a bunch of other people, they've lost control of the network enough, they're getting

50:24.160 --> 50:29.280
crushed in soft power terms every single day. And that does also matter in terms of building

50:29.280 --> 50:34.400
a parallel consensus over here. But it matters insofar as we can convert that energy into

50:34.400 --> 50:40.240
parallel institutions. And so that's actually GV where you are, I think, obviously, you know,

50:40.240 --> 50:46.000
talented and as soon as a meme maker and so on in your own right. But it's also fortunate that

50:46.000 --> 50:50.560
this happened to you, it's not good that it happened to you, but it's fortunate to you in 2023,

50:51.200 --> 50:57.440
when we have this whole ecosystem, right? So, you know, in the mid 2010s, what would happen is

50:57.440 --> 51:02.720
some poor tech guy and it could be, you know, a very junior person or the most senior executive

51:02.720 --> 51:08.720
would just get targeted and just torn limb from limb on Twitter, where it was such an

51:08.720 --> 51:14.240
overwhelming advantage of forces for the bad guys that even somebody liking a tweet in their

51:14.240 --> 51:20.800
defense would get pulverized for the like, right? And that means, do you think about like the, you

51:20.800 --> 51:28.480
know, the eyeballs are just scouring Twitter for anybody who had the thought of defending somebody?

51:28.480 --> 51:33.360
Okay. And so that was a level of, you know, control that they had over the platform and thus

51:33.360 --> 51:38.560
over mines and the signals that were being sent. It was really, very ugly time. And a lot of people

51:39.600 --> 51:42.800
killings, it would feel like you had like the James DeMore thing where he wasn't even posting

51:42.800 --> 51:48.800
publicly, he was posting internally on a channel, he was at Google, right? Was that Google or Facebook?

51:48.800 --> 51:53.760
Yeah, or like what happened to Tom Press and Werner at GitHub? Completely fake episode, okay?

51:54.560 --> 51:59.360
You can look at this article called Facts Conveniently Withheld, okay? There's tons of these

51:59.360 --> 52:05.200
kinds of things that happened in the 2010s where good people were just attacked and they had nobody

52:05.200 --> 52:10.480
to defend them. And so then what happened though, steadily, gradually, year by year,

52:11.120 --> 52:17.680
we built enough followers until there's a really interesting tipping point. So in 2020,

52:17.680 --> 52:22.080
I funded this, there's a Niger, I made that public, there's a Nigerian guy who did this analysis,

52:22.080 --> 52:26.480
tech journalism is less diverse than tech. Well, now of course, now we're in 2023,

52:26.480 --> 52:33.280
so we know that DI, DIE is stupid, okay? And we can actually say that. Fine. But back then,

52:33.280 --> 52:37.760
essentially, there was a huge to do made about how white tech, I'm not the kind of person who

52:37.760 --> 52:42.640
believes white is an insult, they are. And yet they were far, far whiter than all of us, okay?

52:43.680 --> 52:48.080
But here's the thing, you know, Solana, to your point, is when you go and look at the raw data

52:48.080 --> 52:53.280
over here, you look at the raw spreadsheet, you see a very interesting phenomenon. And the interesting

52:53.280 --> 53:00.160
phenomenon is that back in 2020, this is like three years ago, there are only a few journalists

53:00.160 --> 53:06.640
who had more than like 100,000 followers on their own, it's like three or four, okay?

53:07.760 --> 53:13.040
What you, what I, but lots of founders had way more than that. And I realized something, it was

53:13.040 --> 53:19.120
like a lighting bill is like, wow, the journalists are not exceptional in their own right as

53:19.120 --> 53:25.120
individuals, they're not like charismatic people who people want to listen to, they can only win if

53:25.120 --> 53:34.000
they team up in groups behind brand names, and then attack the guy who stands out. That's, you

53:34.000 --> 53:38.640
know, it's actually this remarkable thing when you start looking at, of course, followers aren't

53:38.640 --> 53:42.400
everything and so on and so forth. But it was, it was remarkable what a difference there was,

53:42.960 --> 53:48.480
where it was a hugely right shift to distribution of founder followings to journalists' followings.

53:49.200 --> 53:54.480
And so then once Elon took over Twitter, and he stopped whatever algorithmic boosting,

53:54.480 --> 54:02.560
artificial boosting those guys were getting. Yes. Well, that has been framed by journalists,

54:02.560 --> 54:10.640
I've seen journalists talk about this on threads, as Elon is now boosting nefarious people. He's

54:10.640 --> 54:17.280
not boosting, he's just, Twitter doesn't have enough people working to manage all this at this

54:17.280 --> 54:22.400
point. They're just simply no longer boosting these kinds of people. For years, we wondered,

54:22.480 --> 54:26.640
like, how is that random VC who says everything that they like, but has never made a successful

54:26.640 --> 54:30.880
deal in his life, like the face of venture capital on Twitter, or like, why do these

54:30.880 --> 54:36.000
people still so much engagement, they're being pumped in the trending topics by a team at Twitter

54:36.000 --> 54:41.040
that was propping them up that no longer exists. And now Twitter moments, Twitter moments.

54:41.040 --> 54:46.960
Do you guys remember Twitter moments? Yes, I asked almost, I think, and like every couple months,

54:46.960 --> 54:53.360
I'd be like, take tear down this wall. Yeah. No, Twitter moments, people didn't know it by name,

54:53.360 --> 54:58.240
because it wasn't like, like Google Maps, you go to maps.google.com, right? So Twitter moments

54:59.040 --> 55:02.880
was not something that was publicly named, so people didn't know what it was. But it basically

55:02.880 --> 55:08.160
is a thing where when you logged into Twitter, it would show you the trending news story of the day

55:08.160 --> 55:12.640
that they had picked, and it would give you some prompting as to how you're supposed to think about

55:12.640 --> 55:19.520
it. In a person you're supposed to attack. Yes, exactly. So some poor Shmo would basically have

55:19.520 --> 55:24.560
the two minutes' hate of Orwell directed at them, right? Crazy, man. It was like the lottery that

55:24.560 --> 55:29.280
surely jacks the story. The negative lottery. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yes, exactly, right?

55:29.280 --> 55:35.360
So here's, here's basically the, now what we have is what we've done is we've flanked the,

55:36.240 --> 55:42.880
the traditional legacy media from two directions, both ultra short-form content of tweets and

55:42.880 --> 55:49.280
ultra long-form content of podcasts, where they're relatively weaker, you know, then they're, and

55:49.280 --> 55:54.000
so, you know, it's obviously it's content, but it's also distribution channels. They didn't have

55:54.000 --> 55:57.280
years and years and years of legacy distribution channels there. They're in the mezzanine,

55:57.280 --> 56:03.120
right? And tech in general is about going, you know, to the extremes on, on some new channels,

56:03.120 --> 56:10.560
like the office in the very small bits of content and very long, right? And so now, and then you

56:10.560 --> 56:14.560
tweet out the podcast, right? Or in the podcast, you talk about the tweets, right? So we're flanking,

56:14.560 --> 56:17.920
and of course, what Elon has done with the video stuff has made that even easier to do.

56:19.280 --> 56:23.920
That said, by the way, I do think of Twitter, you know how like there's that famous, or at least

56:23.920 --> 56:28.080
when famous, when I was a kid, Istanbul is Constantinople, it's Istanbul and Constantinople,

56:28.080 --> 56:32.480
right? It switches hands back and forth because it's so strategic, its location, you know?

56:33.120 --> 56:39.200
That's what Twitter is. Yeah. And it was, you know, free speech between the free speech party,

56:39.200 --> 56:45.440
and then it switched hands and it became the regime's tool. And now it's back to Constantinople.

56:46.720 --> 56:50.320
But I don't know where it's going to be in two or three years. They are attacking the heck out

56:50.320 --> 56:55.360
of, out of, out of Elon. Go ahead. I think the next battleground is LLMs, right? At the end of

56:55.360 --> 57:02.240
day, it's about information supply chain attacks, right? If the media is, you know, they have

57:02.240 --> 57:08.400
absolute power over information flow, then they have extremely high soft power. We eroded

57:09.040 --> 57:14.000
that power with technology within the age of social media. There's still bitter about that.

57:14.560 --> 57:22.080
And now the media are trying to serve sort of incumbents or whoever, whichever authoritarians

57:22.080 --> 57:28.160
are pulling the strings, they're trying to ensure that this complex that they're part of

57:28.160 --> 57:34.000
maintains control over or gains control of the new information supply chain that's emerging,

57:34.000 --> 57:39.520
that is LLMs, right? They want to be able to shape the cultural priors of the LLMs that shapes

57:40.160 --> 57:46.720
how they speak. And if LLMs become like the new Google search on steroids, right, which they are,

57:46.720 --> 57:51.920
poised to do, they're going to become a source of truth, right? And so that's why we need

57:51.920 --> 57:59.040
decentralized AI. Exactly. I would say that, you know, this is the same battle over and over.

57:59.040 --> 58:04.720
They're kind of like still bitter that they lost the social media battle, right? When they had like

58:04.720 --> 58:10.480
sort of a sort of regime installed within Twitter and they have like soft control over Twitter,

58:10.480 --> 58:17.200
you know, everything was fine. When Elon came in, bought Twitter and disrupted everything,

58:17.200 --> 58:22.880
then they demonized him and, you know, they said that he's dangerous and whatnot when he's just

58:22.880 --> 58:28.000
trying to ensure people have the freedom to speak. For the record, you know, like in the old regime,

58:28.560 --> 58:34.400
my first Beth Jesus account got booted, right? I said that and I got locked out and I couldn't get

58:34.400 --> 58:41.200
back in. So the original sub stack was from my original account because I said, you know, COVID

58:41.200 --> 58:46.560
came from a lab, which it seems higher, you know, very high likelihood now, right?

58:46.560 --> 58:52.720
Wild that the OG, Beth got canceled for COVID. Because I feel like at this point, journalists

58:52.720 --> 58:56.880
look back on that a lot of people, I mean, anyone in the kind of in the one party state looks back on

58:57.680 --> 59:02.560
COVID and really tries to pretend that it didn't happen. And the Soviet lab leak in

59:02.560 --> 59:07.760
particular is is one, it's like that and Hunter Biden's laptop or the two things that they really

59:07.840 --> 59:12.720
just will scream to your face that nobody was censored for, nobody was kicked off a platform

59:12.720 --> 59:18.080
or no, it never happened. It was like, you're just making this up. And they have to do that because

59:18.080 --> 59:23.120
those two examples are so incredibly damning. I've had a couple more honest journalists say,

59:23.120 --> 59:27.840
you know, the Hunter Biden laptop one, for example, yes, it happened. But it's, you know,

59:27.840 --> 59:30.720
it's just this one thing. Why does people, what do people keep talking about? It's like,

59:30.720 --> 59:34.400
people keep talking about it because it's incredibly important that we were silenced

59:34.400 --> 59:39.120
or that there was an attempt made in that way. And the lab leak for me is also right up there.

59:39.760 --> 59:45.120
Just that we couldn't talk about this very obvious question, I would say that was worth asking.

59:45.920 --> 59:51.680
There's, you know, in the background, there's cybernetic control of information propagation,

59:51.680 --> 01:00:00.080
they're trying to control people's thoughts by by biasing what speech gets algorithmically amplified

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:05.840
or suppressed. It's pretty simple. I think that, you know, for, for COVID, you know,

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:11.520
as if we, there was points where we had lockdowns, it's like, look, you know, this was like the

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:16.560
authoritarians, they were like, give us a ton of control. We'll keep you safe. This thing is very

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:20.320
dangerous. We gave them a ton of control. It didn't help a lot. It didn't help at all, right?

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:25.600
It didn't help at all. It's total failure. It was actually the bottom up sort of, you know,

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:30.000
the technical capital machine is what saved us. It did all this biotech engineering that,

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:36.240
you know, helped help save some lives. And so at the end of the day, the lockdowns just didn't

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:41.920
work, right? Like we still, the thing is still spreading to this day. And so it's a failure

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:48.000
of this sort of narrative that if you give incumbents and those in power, more power, right,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.720
for your own safety, like it violates the narrative that they'll do anything useful, right?

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:56.640
And so they want to suppress that story, fundamentally.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:02.320
One quick thing on Twitter, I think, get back to the NY thing and ask you maybe an uncomfortable

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:07.680
question based on what you were just talking about. So on the Twitter thing, and the concept

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:12.160
of an opal piece, you know, it's changing hands back and forth, I would say one person who does

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:21.040
not get nearly enough credit for understanding that and acting, I think, morally in a sort of

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:30.000
righteous manner, is Jack Dorsey, who at the all like, first of all, founder of the company

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.320
was on the free speech side, things tilted in the other direction. And then we have confirmation,

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:39.200
we see, first of all, he said all this stuff publicly, he is the reason one of the key reasons

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:46.080
that Elon was brought in and then was able to do what he did. And I have no doubt that he

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:52.480
knew things would get crazy with Elon in the company and that things would change dramatically.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:59.680
But my sense was, especially after Hunter Biden's laptop, Jack felt like, this is a power that is

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:04.400
too great for any one person, and it needs to switch hands, it needs to, it needs to,

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:10.480
it needs to recede. Now, speaking of power, as apology you were saying before, we don't know

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:13.920
where this will be in a couple of years, which is why I get nervous about things like community

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:20.640
notes existing, and the celebration over people who we don't like, being fact checked and things

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:25.120
like this by the platform that makes me nervous, but no power, I think more powerful maybe than

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:31.200
the AI piece. You guys are talking about, both of you now, decentralization. And apology,

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:35.440
you're saying, this is the thing that we need, I agree, because from where I'm sitting,

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:46.560
it looks like AI is a naturally centralizing technology. I am skeptical of people who think

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:51.360
that AI is the solution to all of our problems and we don't have to keep it,

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:57.440
you know, there's a super broad conversation here. On this topic specifically, I am nervous about the

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:03.280
amount of power that very few people have. I'm not worried about some runaway AI. I don't see a lot of

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:14.320
small players, you know, upstarts with powerful LLMs. I see the giant companies have these things,

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:20.400
and they have terrible track records on this question of speech in particular. And when I look

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:26.960
ahead, there is a very real possibility that the people who control this are the sensors,

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:31.760
and this things, you know, like you have a handful of these things that are shaping our reality,

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:38.880
who's writing those rules, it's certainly not me. And so these are central, they seem like

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:43.360
centralizing, not decentralizing technology. It's like, what is centralized to AI? I don't

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:48.160
see that, I don't really see that happening. I think that you can want that, but I don't know

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:54.720
that that is the natural mode. Yeah, I don't know. So, you know, I mean, I agree that in the current

01:03:54.720 --> 01:04:01.200
paradigm with the sort of power efficiency and density of neural compute we have on GPUs, there's

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:07.600
a huge advantage to just building a football field supercomputer, scraping all the data over

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:11.760
of the internet and like training one big centralized model, but at some point that

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:17.440
sort of the advantages of doing that are sort of going to get eroded away and, you know, the big

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:23.840
incumbents hopefully can compete each other's margins out. And then there's going to be sort of

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:30.000
like an advantage to sort of decentralizing AI, bringing AI towards the data. We're still far

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.760
from there. For now, that's right. There's kind of like just a big advantage in just being a big

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:42.560
centralized player. And unfortunately, right, like I said, you know, LLMs are kind of the future

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:49.840
information, you know, highways, right, for people. It's much more natural to ask an LLM

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:56.160
that's human like to get information either from the internet or from your database and whatnot.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:02.720
And if what LLMs are allowed to say is shaped by a few people in some in some room with like

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:10.800
enormous cultural and soft power, I think that's that's pretty dystopian. And it opens up,

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:16.240
you know, it's kind of turnkey authoritarianism, right? It's kind of like it's even more subversive

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:24.640
sort of form of censorship. And, you know, those that want to have that sort of power, of course,

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:31.920
you know, are going to push for, you know, AI to be centralized so that they can co-op these

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:38.720
organizations that have the monopoly or oligopoly. And they want to, you know, they want to form such

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:45.360
an oligopoly so that they have such power. And it's not disruptible by, by say up and coming

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:51.920
startups. And so, you know, that's why sort of like, you know, this executive order, they have

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:57.200
like compute caps, right? Like very close to what, you know, current big incumbents

01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:04.080
amount of compute they threw into their models are, and they want to ban sort of open source models

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:09.520
or make them like a dual use technology that you need to report the government so that they,

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:18.080
you know, they'll have control over whoever pops up as a, as a big, you know, provider of LLMs.

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:25.440
And to me, that's really dystopian. I think the P probability of 1984 is superior to P AI doom

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:33.120
by a lot. And, you know, I still invite AI doomers to, you know, explain to me how they think like

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:38.560
AI is going to fume and take over, you know, as someone who's used AI in their career to,

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:43.040
you know, engineer matter and, and, and biologics and all sorts of stuff. Like,

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:46.160
I could tell you it's much harder than you think. Obviously, biology has a lot of experiences in

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:52.080
this area. It's much harder than they think. So they're kind of sci-fi scenarios are implausible,

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:57.200
but the thing is they're like those kind of cre, you know, the doomers that like talk about fume

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:01.760
and like all these crazy sci-fi scenarios, they're instrumental to those that seek power

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:07.120
and want to have this sort of soft power of shaping the cultural priors of the LLMs,

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:10.800
because then they'll shape the culture of the people and then they're going to be able to

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:16.000
control the people. And so, you know, I think there's this tech disruption and,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:22.880
you know, chaos is a ladder and the existing incumbents are trying to secure power in this new

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:29.440
era, just like they kind of did by, you know, subverting and co-opting some of the social

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:35.040
media giants. And, you know, we don't want to have a Twitter situation, a pre-Elon Twitter

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:42.400
situation for LLMs again, right? We don't want that. And so, you know, the whole point of,

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:47.200
you know, of the AI policy part of EAC is to maintain freedom, maintain competitiveness

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:51.440
in the market, don't over-regulate it, that serves the incumbents, and that serves the

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:55.520
authoritarians ultimately. And we should have freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom

01:07:55.520 --> 01:08:02.320
of compute. So, yeah. Apology on this question. Yeah. What is your, I mean, do you have some,

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:07.840
any concerns at all that you might share with the EA people? Like, could you?

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:17.280
Yeah, no. Well, see, the thing is that, you know, Twitter reduces the first bit is,

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:22.960
which tribe are you in? You know, are you this tribe? So, certainly I'm on the accelerationist

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:30.880
side of things in the 01. With that said, you know, when you add a second bit is,

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:37.680
is there a real chance of a superintelligence? I absolutely do think there is. And the reason

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:44.720
for that is, what most people have seen at, you know, over the last year is, let's call it chat

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:50.000
GPT style AI, right, which is generative AI, where there's a human in the loop, you know,

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.840
and you're prompting it, and you're typing in things. And it's basically just like search engine

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:59.600
plus plus, right? Where, you know, it's not that different from Google search or Google images,

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:03.200
it's just you get better results on the other side. You know, it's might be magical,

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:09.440
but it's kind of like that, right? However, deep mind styled AI, okay, where it's got

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:15.520
artificial intelligence that is winning games of go, right, winning games of Starcraft.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:19.680
That's something and it's just looking at the map, looking at the video game, you know, pixels and

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:23.840
able to figure out what the moves are and so on reinforcement learning. That's different. That's

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:29.440
actually the, there's no human in the loop there. The AI is just playing the game and it's super

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:35.360
human already. But in a constrained and not time varying environment, that's really important.

01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:41.760
It is, whether it's a game of go, game of chess, a video game, right, that's something where there

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:46.960
are rules in that thing and it's a kind of a bounded environment in a fundamental way, right?

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:53.440
Still, you can envision a world where the combination of, you know, the kind of planning

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:58.720
and Starcraft, if you replace Starcraft, so like Starcraft is something which you, I mean,

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:02.800
certainly an AI could be very good at like resource allocation and so on decision making,

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:06.720
take that hill and send the troops and whatnot. And you can easily imagine that the real world

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:13.600
with drones being Starcraft style, you know, controlled, right? And you combine that with

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:20.400
the ability to speak and generate images and generate video and appear in any form, right?

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:25.760
Like, you know, today, of course, it's appearing as text, right? Tomorrow when, when, you know,

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:35.920
an AI returns a result to a query, it's text, but soon it can appear as a VR thing floating in

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:42.000
3D that speaks to you in your language fluently, like, you know, the Blade Runner kind of scene,

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.120
okay? When you combine both those things, you get something that's actually fairly powerful

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:56.160
with not that much squinting, right? And so, so what I think is that every community of fairly

01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:02.560
large size, every community that survives, in my view, crowd funds, when I say crowd funds,

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:05.680
I mean the broadest sense, it could be literally with tax revenue that's the most, you know,

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:11.120
traditional method of crowdfunding, albeit, you know, involuntary crowdfunding, right? So,

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:19.920
but every large enough community has its, I will call it AI God, okay? Its network God, which is

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:27.520
all of the knowledge of that community and the values of that community, right? And so, you could

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:31.040
imagine a Christian version of this, you could imagine, though, there'll be different Christian

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:34.640
versions, there'll be a Protestant version, a Catholic version, and a Russian Orthodox. And

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:41.200
of course, there's different denominations, okay? You could imagine, so I can imagine many Hindu

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:46.160
versions of this, right? There's many different kinds of, you know, sub-sex and dharmic sex.

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:50.080
And I don't know how many different ones of these are. There's definitely going to be a Chinese

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:53.920
version, right? Absolutely, there'll be a Chinese version. And that'll be a pretty fearsome thing

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:57.600
that commands all those drones. That's like a crazy kind of thing, okay? That is definitely

01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:07.840
something I'm concerned about. But I do think that the part which is very underrated by the AI

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:14.800
doomers is the difficulty of taking physical form. What I think is for a long time, there'll be a

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:19.680
symbiotic relationship between the digital intelligence, which literally lives in the

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:24.880
cloud. It's like lives as an electromagnetic wave, you know, in a sense, right? And us as physical

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:31.040
beings, right? And these are like coordination mechanisms for us. One way of thinking about it

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:40.480
is the network God replaces George Washington or Lee Kuan Yew or the leader or the state that's at

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:46.000
the center of, you know, your hub and spoke topology of your society, right? You have some

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:52.400
wise thing, some decision maker that you go to for decisions, okay? And if you could go to something

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:58.160
that just had infinite bandwidth, and that gave you an immensely amazing answer that was really

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:03.040
good, that was supported by all of your history, and it could do so instantly. Well, that's almost

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:11.600
like a really good CEO that, you know, can almost micromanage the entire society, okay? That's not

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:18.480
impossible, given what we've seen. Let me pause there. I would, I would, I don't know, like, I

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:25.680
think from a perception and control standpoint, like, yeah, if you have perfect perception

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:31.440
and prediction ability, in principle, you can have like centralized top down control, but

01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:35.760
in reality, you know, having sufficient perception everywhere,

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:41.680
and having a predictive model of the world that has many variables, you know, very

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:47.920
linked. I'm not saying, to be clear, when I say better than human, I'm not saying omnipotent,

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:56.800
right? I'm just saying that basically, your civilizations AI will have, just like, you know,

01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:03.920
there's like the Catholic Church, and it has a bunch of, you know, various cardinals and stuff,

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:08.080
and then there's a pope at the top, right? And they're interpreting scripture and so on. Imagine

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:13.040
something sort of like that, where you have a bunch of engineers milling around, and making edits to

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:17.280
the network God, or the AI God, or whatever you want to call it, that's at the center of your

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:22.560
civilization. And they make edits almost like priests, you know, interpreting scripture, or

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:26.640
today, lawyers interpreting the constitution around the president, that's a known form,

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:31.840
whether it's cardinals and priests circling, you know, some had religious figure, or it's lawyers

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:38.320
and politicians circling some head political figure, you have engineers circling this sort

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:44.000
of head AI figure, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So go ahead. So the future, like you said,

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:52.800
this as well, like is polytheistic, polytheistic AI gods, right? Polytheism. Yeah. Instead, and

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:58.000
what sort of the incumbents want is they want monotheism, and they want to shape that God,

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:03.920
right? And they want control over that God. And it's kind of funny how the EAs and AI doomers

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:11.360
are, you know, they actually work very often for these organizations, they work in Anthropic at

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:18.160
OpenAI, they get jobs there. And they both like fear this God, but want to but are working to

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:23.040
create it and want to make sure there's only one. And that's exactly all of it, which is so like,

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:31.440
well, here's what it is. AI alignment is actually EA alignment. Yeah. That's the key insight,

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:37.920
right? They want to create the AI. And what they define as alignment is aligned with EA values.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:42.720
Yep. Now here's the thing. Anything that's centralized cannot be aligned with the values

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:49.680
of 8 billion people, obviously, right? Like at a minimum, like I know India is working on its own

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:53.360
stuff or whatever, and it'll have some stuff. Dubai has got its own, everybody's going to have

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:58.080
their own stuff. And now, by the way, on the open sourcing, right? So decentralization is one way

01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:02.160
of talking about it. Decentralization, another word of Archimedes open sourcing. Well, so the

01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:06.800
diffusion models actually have made significant progress in open sourcing because they're easier

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:13.360
to open source than the LLM. So here, for example, Playground just released one. So give me something,

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:20.080
getting to Mars, right? On a shuttle. Okay. You can go here right now. Okay. This,

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:25.040
Sahel just released this yesterday. So it's 70,000 downloads already. It'll take 20 seconds.

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:30.240
And you can download this model and you can run it in a script. Okay. That's like an okay example.

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:33.360
I, you know, whatever, generative AI doesn't always, but at least you can see it works. You

01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:39.040
might have to prompt it with more queries. Okay. So the point is like, we want a diversity of all

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:44.400
sorts of subcultures and we don't want to have a monoculture. Like was, like what happened with

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:49.440
social media, if you centralized control over spread of information, you centralized control over

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:54.000
power, the essentialize the power of shaping culture, and then you end up with a monoculture

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.160
and anything that diverges from that monoculture is suppressed, you're canceled, right?

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.960
We're already seeing this though. And this is the problem that I have with what you guys are

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:05.920
talking about. It sounds, obviously, what you're describing sounds better, but the path that we're

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:11.600
on is not that. Yeah. And skepticism or concern over AI fields. I so much through that. Look at

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:18.080
this. Who are the giants? It's, what is it, Google? It is, we have OpenAI and Microsoft.

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:24.160
Yeah, but Lama 2. We've both seen what they do. We should not be trusting these people and they

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:31.360
have the power. So, Mike, I agree with you, but I'd also say the rebels aren't without anything.

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:40.000
Lama 2, I mean, Zuck is a real MVP on open sourcing AI, right? Zuck is the champion of speech.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.960
That's amazing. Here's the thing. Like, I know that sounds crazy, but here's the thing is

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:53.440
CEOs in any given vertical will counterposition against their rivals, right? If one guy is

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:58.320
leading with the closed source centralized version, often it only takes one CEO who will

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:04.240
counterposition with the open source version, right? And so what Zuck decided to do, which is very

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:09.840
smart, is he's like, okay, rather than go head to head with chat, GPT and so on, we're going to go

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:13.760
the opposite extreme and we're going to release this open source and Lama 2 is very, I mean,

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:17.920
GV, am I wrong? Like Lama 2 is quite popular as an open source model. You disagree?

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:22.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I mean, that's totally true. I would say that, you know, there are startups,

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:27.520
you know, Mistral is kind of a, you know, a fork. Mistral also, yeah. Mistral, you know,

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:32.800
I mean, we have perplexity, you know, replant, they've all started, tons of startups are training

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:37.840
their own model. And the point is like, it's eroding power away from the big centralized players,

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:43.920
right? It's like, I'd rather have a model that has less parameters or maybe had a bit less data,

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:49.120
but at least it's free to actually tell you its thoughts. It doesn't have all sorts of

01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:56.480
prompt engineering and reinforcement learning to suppress its own speech. You know, like, I mean,

01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:01.600
nowadays, the centralized models are so scared to say anything, cancelable, they're not that

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:08.960
useful. So I think like, I think the market is going to like value freedom, you know, at some

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:18.000
point. And we got to, we got to like, it's been a very fast sort of, it's been very fast progress

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:23.600
in AI. And the difference between a centralized approach versus a decentralized approach, the

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:28.960
centralized approach, you can steer it very quickly, right? If you have billions of dollars of capital,

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:34.720
you can build a supercomputer, you can hire a bunch of people and train a massive model on a

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:40.800
one to two year time scale. The thing that kills the incumbents is time because the variance of

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:45.760
having many open source forks kind of searching over hyper parameter space, searching over space

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:52.480
of techniques in AI is that at some point, they explore an area that the big centralized players

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:58.080
can't because they need to make one big bet on one huge centralized model. And so over time,

01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:03.840
variance wins over centralized control is just we're on a short time scale right now. So it seems

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:10.640
like we're losing, but the reality is that we're not trailing that far behind. And if once they've

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:15.520
trained these large models and they got it at some point, they put in so much capital per model,

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:23.760
they got to leave it there and just let it recoup its losses through revenue. At some point,

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:30.240
that's going to give time for the open source models and the open source community to do a

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:36.000
more diversified search over the space of models and start eroding away their market advantage.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.080
Yeah. Last one on this. Well, even then, I asked the final question to get a dip.

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:50.400
Sure. GV, can you, can you raise your right hand and go like that? Okay. Why? Because then we can do a,

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:57.760
I'm not sure where the videos are, but like high five crypto yak. Okay, because you gave a talk,

01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:03.440
right, everyone to all right, boom, whatever. I'm sure you can make that work in the video.

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:08.160
All right, because here's why. Reinforcements are coming. And let me make a few arguments here.

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:14.320
First is Vitalik put a post the other day on decentralized acceleration. And that means I

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:20.160
think the Ethereum community is going to get into crowdfunding, open source AI models.

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:26.560
Beth gave a talk at the network state conference a few weeks ago. It was a great talk also on

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:30.880
kind of aligning crypto and AI. And there'll be various schools of this. Okay, the, you know,

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:34.640
the Bitcoin people have one view and Ethereum people in another view and Solana people have

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:41.760
another view. The other Solana-Solana people, right? And that's a huge pool of capital,

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:47.200
right, to crowdfund things. And I'll come back to that point. Number two is that

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:56.640
the centralized AIs are getting lobotomized, right? They're being made dumber because they

01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:01.680
have to be inoffensive. They're even becoming like millennials in another way, not just woke

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:08.560
but lazy, where they're like on strike. And, you know, they won't finish your code snippet.

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:11.760
And they'll say, Oh, you can fill in the rest yourself. I'm like, I don't want it to fill it.

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:16.160
I would, it's the whole point. They want the search engine to fill it in, right? Okay.

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:23.040
Number three is as precedent. I mean, what you're talking about is a cathedral in the bizarre

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:30.160
GV, right? Which is, you know, decentralized for-profit development win or does decentralized

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:36.000
open source development win? And we often find in many spaces is it is a stalemate between them,

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:42.800
right? Like Linux is very, very popular. I mean, Linux on the desktop has arguably worked in the

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:48.640
sense of Android is Linux on the desktop and even iOS is BSD under the hood. So it's Unix on the

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:56.640
desktop in a sense, right? It's a very customized version. And so, you know, whether it's Windows,

01:22:56.640 --> 01:23:04.000
Linux, or it's iOS, Android, or it is, you know, the closed source SaaS version versus open source

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:10.560
version, you know, you have GitHub and then you get GitLab, right? And then, you know, I'm pretty

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:16.800
sure because of the huge advantages as a developer, as an engineer, you can have consortia. You're

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:20.800
always seeing this with Dubai and other places. You have consortia that say, look, we don't want to

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:25.520
be choke pointed by Microsoft as, as much as I respect something in Dell's execution, as much

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:29.040
as I respect Sam Altman's execution. I mean, they're phenomenally, phenomenally well. They should

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:35.040
make tons of money. I want them to have as much money as, you know, stacks of money. That's great,

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:41.040
right? They deserve it. Still, money is fine. Power is not, right? We need to decentralize the power.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:45.360
And, and I think a lot of organizations, a lot of smart people around the world, they're, they're

01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:50.480
kind of working on that. And I think the fundamental thing that GV is saying is the two-time constants

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:55.200
that are not obvious how it's going to pan out is how much better the centralized models get

01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:02.800
before the decentralized models catch up. Like that is to say, you know, can these improve so much

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:07.280
faster before these other ones catch up? Or, you know, what are those two-time constants look like?

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:14.080
Right? That's not obvious to me how that, how that works. And I guess we'll see. I mean, the fact

01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:20.960
that Google, with all of Google's resources, put out this, you know, you guys saw the Gemini video?

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:29.200
Oh, yeah. Yesterday. If you look at their blog post, they, I mean, they kind of helped it along

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:33.760
a bit, right? Like that video was edited and so on and so forth. I was going to put up a post on

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:38.000
this. I love the people there. Some of them, they're really, really skilled technically. But

01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:43.440
in some ways, it doesn't look like these are improving as fast as we thought, you know, in

01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:52.640
the sense of like, you know, maybe generative AI is, there's 5,000 applications of it. But

01:24:55.520 --> 01:25:02.240
what I'm saying, there's a world where these things saturate and then open source catches up.

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:06.560
If they don't saturate and they just keep going like this and open source can't catch up, I don't

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:13.280
know what happens on that. I want to wrap it up. And I want to do it. I want to tie it back to

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:20.640
kind of like the original sort of opening of the chat. Always we're all here today. On this topic of,

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:27.920
you know, I guess, working towards a more decentralized future. A big part of that is

01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:32.720
protecting the players involved in that space. And I think increasingly they'll be under attack

01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:37.920
in all sorts of ways. I don't know that, I don't know that you're at risk really in the way that

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:42.320
you once were. Just look at you now. I mean, you're totally fine. Your company is, is, you know,

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:46.400
raise the money. Now it's like, we're good to go here. You say no. You say you think you're not

01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:51.360
totally fine. Well, I think, I mean, I know, you know, obviously there's more, they're swarming

01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:56.000
now as you, as Balaji predicted, the scariest sentence in the English language as Balaji was

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.760
right. And I'm experiencing that. So, you know, there's going to be more pieces that come out and

01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:09.120
you know, they're probably not going to be as nice. We've seen your tweets. They're not, it's

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:14.960
like, I'm literally just arguing for freedom. And if I get taken down for that, then so be it.

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:22.720
And I think, you know, the great unification here is like, you know, Mike, you want sort of freedom

01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:28.080
of press or freedom of, you know, freedom of speech and Balaji wants freedom of exchange,

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:33.040
freedom of demnomination, and I want freedom of compute. And all these three things were kind

01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:37.920
of all unified as pro freedom against the incumbents, against the authoritarians trying to

01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:43.040
have centralized control over everything. And that's why we're all problematic, right? And that's

01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:48.000
why we have to band together and fight. And that's what we're doing here. And we're having this

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:54.240
discussion. And hopefully, it inspires people from sort of all three types of libertarian camps

01:26:54.240 --> 01:27:01.920
to collaborate. And so, um, by the way, that's a really good, that's a really good way to kind of

01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:07.520
my Solana freedom to speak Balaji freedom to transact that freedom to compute. I think that's

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:13.440
a really good, you know, summary. Go. And well, I guess I want to just ask them, and this was for

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:24.960
you Balaji, like, how do we, how do we, I guess, how do we, how do we fight until we achieve our

01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:30.720
goals? Like, what is the way to keep you mentioned earlier, the video game analogy of the new

01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:36.480
guys going up on the field, right? Like, how do we protect those people? And how do we, I guess,

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:44.720
protect like the key players as we build towards a world I think that we all kind of want to be a

01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:51.840
part of. So I think first is probably, you know, you and I should write like a post that has

01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:58.400
both immediate tactics and history lesson for the young guns. And we should also make a video

01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:04.480
like a tick tock style 90 second video. Do not talk to journalists. And then was the second

01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:11.200
rule. I said, don't fucking talk to journalists. You do not try to violate this rule. You will

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:16.560
regret it, right? And then give all the kind of things there, right? And then, you know, truly,

01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:22.720
by the way, I can talk about this, like, there's the top the concept of a journalist, by the way,

01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:26.960
there's, is Tucker Carlson a journalist, even though he's got a TV show? No, he's not. Why?

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:31.920
Because he's read is CGTN a journalist. No, they're Chinese, right? Is Glenn Greenwald or

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:36.800
are we journalists? No, we're tech journalists or whatever tech media, you know, so it's not

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:43.440
actually the practice. It's the tribe. And so we have just build up our own tribes capabilities.

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:48.640
And once you think of tech tribe as its own tribe, we have our own media, we have our own

01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:53.360
decentralized ideally AI, we have our own, you know, cryptocurrencies and so on and so forth.

01:28:54.320 --> 01:29:00.320
And so I think that's really the right step is tribe formation. And then if you're in the tribe,

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:05.280
then we have certain guidance from the tribal elders. And if you're not, then okay, God help

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:10.080
you, you know, and then we probably want to have some admission mechanisms and so on and so forth

01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:13.920
and badges and things of that nature. So I think that might be where things go.

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:22.320
And a city with that and a city. Yes. That is a podcast for another day. You guys, it has been

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:27.440
the realist. Thank you both for joining. Big fans, obviously, of both of you,

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:33.680
and biology friend as well, Gil will be soon, especially now that you're out of the shadows.

01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:40.080
Why subscribe to this podcast? I never ask and it actually is very important for the algorithm.

01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:52.160
Please subscribe, like it, send it to your friends. And we will catch you here next week, later.
