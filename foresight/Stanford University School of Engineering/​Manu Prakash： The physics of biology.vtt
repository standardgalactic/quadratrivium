00:00.000 --> 00:15.200
from the campus of stanford university people are worried about data they're

00:15.200 --> 00:18.600
worried about their privacy and their security they should be we need secure

00:18.600 --> 00:23.360
systems this is the future of everything but we can't have a system that

00:23.360 --> 00:28.720
closes that data off it is too rich of a source of inspiration innovation and

00:28.720 --> 00:35.200
discovery for new things in medicine today on the future of everything the

00:35.200 --> 00:41.800
future of using physics to understand biology and to build new devices now

00:41.800 --> 00:46.040
when we think of physics we often think of the study of fundamental forces in

00:46.040 --> 00:51.080
the world gravity the theory of relativity electricity the big bang

00:51.080 --> 00:55.960
black holes dark matter we may think about the big experimental facilities

00:55.960 --> 01:00.880
around the world big telescopes particle beams and linear accelerators the

01:00.880 --> 01:07.040
detection of cosmic events black holes we may not think however about biology

01:07.040 --> 01:13.080
biological systems of course of course must obey the rules of physics but

01:13.080 --> 01:17.520
somehow those rules seem distant and not directly applicable in biological

01:17.520 --> 01:22.400
systems we may not always think of a physicist studying fundamental forces

01:22.400 --> 01:27.440
relevant to biology life on earth and creating devices for measuring these

01:27.440 --> 01:33.440
phenomenon but of course physicists do do this indeed life on earth has had to

01:33.440 --> 01:38.040
evolve in response I'm saying obvious things here to the physical world to

01:38.040 --> 01:43.600
solve some remarkable problems how do we encode the shapes of living organisms

01:43.600 --> 01:47.520
so that with just their DNA with just their genome they can

01:47.560 --> 01:54.040
reproducibly form their expected shape how can living organisms work with water

01:54.040 --> 01:58.480
water is a fascinating substance it has special properties in terms of its

01:58.480 --> 02:03.960
chemical makeup its electrical activity how it interacts with itself and its

02:03.960 --> 02:09.120
ability to host other molecules that are dissolved within it how can we build

02:09.120 --> 02:14.240
physical systems in living systems that perceive signals how do we perceive

02:14.400 --> 02:20.400
visual signals audio signals touch taste these must all be sensed at a

02:20.400 --> 02:25.040
molecular physical level and then integrated into useful signals that

02:25.040 --> 02:29.480
the organism can then integrate to figure out the key things like where's the

02:29.480 --> 02:32.960
light where's the food pretty much that's actually that's pretty much

02:32.960 --> 02:37.160
everything where's the light where's the food where's the mate so these are the

02:37.160 --> 02:41.880
basic functions of living systems now a fascinating branch of biology is the

02:41.920 --> 02:46.400
study of how biological systems take advantage of physics to accomplish

02:46.400 --> 02:52.680
complex tasks tasks that appear to be difficult or even impossible so what am

02:52.680 --> 02:57.480
I talking about well this includes the study of self-assembly where individual

02:57.480 --> 03:03.120
units of a biological system can create a complex structure without any

03:03.120 --> 03:07.880
explicit instructions let me give an example there are viruses spherical

03:07.880 --> 03:13.360
viruses that are particles made up of 180 identical subunits that form these

03:13.360 --> 03:19.280
beautiful perfect spheres that contain these beautiful perfect spheres that

03:19.280 --> 03:25.600
contain the DNA that makes the virus infectious just based on how these

03:25.720 --> 03:31.200
individual proteins they are interact with one another they can spontaneously

03:31.200 --> 03:35.400
form these shells there's no need to build a scaffold there's no need to say

03:35.400 --> 03:40.400
okay now you go there you go there they just kind of because of their intrinsic

03:40.400 --> 03:44.120
physical features they assemble with one another and they form these spheres

03:44.120 --> 03:49.520
similarly the outer membrane of a cell which is lipids that create a boundary

03:49.520 --> 03:54.440
between the inside and the outside of the cell are made of lipid molecules that

03:54.440 --> 03:59.400
self-assemble to form these compartments that support the living machinery

03:59.400 --> 04:03.640
imagine having a bunch of fabric and saying could you please make me a tent

04:03.880 --> 04:08.800
and whoosh the fabric spontaneously forms a tent in the case of the virus

04:08.800 --> 04:13.080
imagine just having pieces Lego pieces lying around which will spontaneously

04:13.080 --> 04:17.400
form a sphere without any effort this is what happens in many times in biology

04:17.400 --> 04:21.880
or how DNA of course forms these beautiful double helices that look a lot

04:21.880 --> 04:26.840
like helical staircases imagine wanting a helical staircase in your mansion not a

04:26.840 --> 04:31.880
problem that I have where you just get all the materials and they self-assemble

04:31.920 --> 04:37.880
into a beautiful double helix without any instruction we do not understand all

04:37.880 --> 04:42.480
the ways in which by lock biological systems have harnessed physics to solve

04:42.480 --> 04:46.080
these problems but we have examples where where it has this is worth

04:46.080 --> 04:50.880
understanding big both because of natural curiosity of how biological systems

04:50.880 --> 04:55.560
work and because it may elucidate principles that allow us to take

04:55.560 --> 05:01.400
advantage of these same are the of these rules to build devices and new

05:01.400 --> 05:06.320
capabilities in in our world that can advance our technology and our

05:06.320 --> 05:12.160
understanding my guest today is professor Manu Prakash from the

05:12.160 --> 05:16.520
department of bioengineering at Stanford University and Manu is an expert

05:16.520 --> 05:21.800
physicist working on biological systems he studies the physics of biological

05:21.800 --> 05:26.880
systems at the molecular cellular and tissue level and he also takes the

05:26.880 --> 05:31.080
insights that he learns from this deep dive into the physics of biological

05:31.080 --> 05:36.920
systems to build cool devices we'll get to the devices but Manu as someone who

05:36.920 --> 05:41.480
trained as a physicist applied physics what drew you to biological systems and

05:41.480 --> 05:46.920
what do you tell your fellow physicists about what's exciting or challenging

05:46.920 --> 05:55.960
about biology you know it's once in a life you get this moment where you take

05:55.960 --> 06:01.200
a backseat and you think you know what do you want your life to be and that

06:01.200 --> 06:05.120
happens a couple of times in our lives and that happened to me right after grad

06:05.120 --> 06:12.480
school and anybody who's peered through a microscope would know that there is a

06:12.480 --> 06:17.560
piece of matter that we do not understand that we cannot write down a

06:17.560 --> 06:26.200
bunch of equations to explain and it's so us you know biology so us so I mean you

06:26.200 --> 06:31.080
know I was studying many different things in the past but that that emotional

06:31.080 --> 06:35.600
connection you have with aha you know not only am I trying to understand this

06:35.600 --> 06:40.120
piece of matter but my act of understanding it is that piece of matter

06:40.400 --> 06:45.600
very meta yeah that was that's the philosophical times that you go in and

06:45.600 --> 06:51.240
then you ask this is what I want to do for my life and I think I find it's a

06:51.240 --> 06:55.000
little bit strange sometimes I mean you're right I have to explain some

06:55.000 --> 06:58.320
times to my physics friends that hey this is the most exciting thing in the

06:58.320 --> 07:03.280
world and sometimes I think that sense of wonder if you just share that sense of

07:03.280 --> 07:08.400
wonder first yes I mean the aesthetic and beauty in biology is incredible and

07:08.400 --> 07:14.120
if you're not working on a beautiful problem then you know find a new problem

07:14.120 --> 07:18.160
now I want to give you credit though because I know many physicists who take

07:18.160 --> 07:24.040
a little they dip their toes into biology they love mathematical equations

07:24.040 --> 07:28.160
that explain the world if you've taken any physics you know f equals ma it's

07:28.160 --> 07:32.720
very famous force equals mass times acceleration based on that very simple

07:32.880 --> 07:37.920
equation you can derive how we got men to the moon how we build devices that

07:37.920 --> 07:41.320
work and that don't break and and sometimes my physics friends that you

07:41.320 --> 07:47.080
know biology is too squishy there's no right angles there's no real underlying

07:47.080 --> 07:52.360
mathematical formalism and I'm out I'm sorry yeah this did not happen to you

07:52.360 --> 07:59.640
yeah or did it not yet not yet I think I'm naive and I am perfectly happy being

07:59.680 --> 08:05.080
naive sometimes and I mean I actually tell most of my students you have to be

08:05.080 --> 08:09.920
naive sometimes to have the guts that we will try to understand this piece of

08:09.920 --> 08:16.400
matter and I think I mean to your point about the complexity it's it is what

08:16.400 --> 08:22.120
makes biology so much more fun that although there are these rules there is

08:22.120 --> 08:28.200
every time an exception to that rule yes and I find that fascinating so so you

08:28.280 --> 08:31.520
have worked on this self-assembly issue I talked about the viruses and some

08:31.520 --> 08:34.800
other things tell us what what is the state of our understanding of self

08:34.800 --> 08:39.880
assembling systems and are we just at at a baby point or are we beginning to

08:39.880 --> 08:44.000
really understand the what's going on when these systems do these amazing

08:44.840 --> 08:50.560
activities of creating complex objects from simple subunits yeah so I mean I

08:50.560 --> 08:55.200
would argue we're really at the beginning and the reason for that is most

08:55.200 --> 08:59.160
of our insights initially in that field have come from just watching biology

08:59.680 --> 09:03.960
the fact that now we have the capability of really ripping apart a virus

09:03.960 --> 09:08.440
particle and really see the sets of components gives us the sense that we

09:08.440 --> 09:12.600
are starting to understand the list of components but how they come together

09:12.600 --> 09:18.040
and build things that are not one even two or three orders of magnitude larger

09:18.040 --> 09:22.960
than the component like your example of truly bringing a grant grand staircase

09:23.320 --> 09:29.880
from a point of view of a molecule a cell is a gigantic staircase we don't

09:29.880 --> 09:33.960
really understand where these lens scales are set up you know where is that

09:33.960 --> 09:39.520
encoded shape and form at higher levels hierarchy has been really fantastic so I

09:39.520 --> 09:45.080
think we we don't exploit that too much in and I think the other aspect of the

09:45.080 --> 09:51.160
field has really grown when we had tried to take small components and then ask

09:51.200 --> 09:55.120
ourselves we are going to build something out of it so for example the

09:55.120 --> 10:01.440
entire world of DNA all algorithmic assembly or even general ideas where you

10:01.440 --> 10:06.360
take and now make components that are literally dead but still demonstrate the

10:06.360 --> 10:11.040
principles that's where the most exciting bits that I see because I start to see

10:11.040 --> 10:15.280
an inkling of things that we would never been able to manufacture before this is

10:15.280 --> 10:19.200
the future everything of everything I'm Russ Altman I'm speaking with Professor

10:19.200 --> 10:23.800
Manu Prakash about physics and its influences these days on biology what

10:23.800 --> 10:27.920
is your favorite current system to look at to understand self-assembly I'm

10:27.920 --> 10:31.840
trying to get this down to a real system that you find fascinating that you think

10:31.840 --> 10:39.280
you might be able to understand yeah so this is kind of it's slightly ironic but

10:39.280 --> 10:44.920
sometimes what ends up happening is the biology inspires an insight and then you

10:44.920 --> 10:49.120
can take that insight and even work on that system in an abiotic manner

10:49.120 --> 10:53.640
non-biological non-biological and so there is a system in the lab that we've

10:53.640 --> 10:58.160
been trying to build now for several years to really demonstrate that we can

10:58.160 --> 11:06.400
do algorithmic self-assembly using droplets droplets yeah there is a two

11:06.400 --> 11:11.440
years ago we demonstrated a type of an active droplet system that demonstrates

11:11.440 --> 11:14.960
are you talking about fluid droplets that's correct fluid droplets but they

11:14.960 --> 11:20.280
can actually be phase droplets they can be protein droplets very fluid like phases

11:20.280 --> 11:25.160
that demonstrate very phenomena that you would not be able to distinguish from

11:25.160 --> 11:30.920
chemotaxis for example they can sense each other they can crawl they can chase

11:30.920 --> 11:36.040
each other but they're not living they're just physical literally small bits

11:36.040 --> 11:40.440
molecules of fluid and they're communicating with each other now

11:40.440 --> 11:43.680
that sounds like magic you got you have to tell us I have to stop you then you

11:43.680 --> 11:48.160
have to give us a sense of how that could possibly happen yeah so you can do

11:48.160 --> 11:53.120
this in your kitchen go right now and find some food coloring in your kitchen

11:53.120 --> 11:59.000
and some water and mix it up on a clean glass slide and put these two drops next

11:59.000 --> 12:03.560
to each other in a few moments you will notice that these two food coloring

12:03.560 --> 12:07.720
droplets will be talking to each other what they do is they send out a water

12:07.720 --> 12:13.320
signal there is a vapor cloud around it vapor cloud yes and that vapor cloud is

12:13.320 --> 12:17.800
interacting and there is more vapor between the two than around the

12:17.800 --> 12:22.320
surroundings and that leads to this incredible phenomena which is not so

12:22.320 --> 12:26.920
far from retrograde flows in cells where cells are these engines with all these

12:26.920 --> 12:32.880
motors moving around but this purely arises in a physical system and so the

12:32.880 --> 12:38.440
reason I brought that example is sometimes we although biology is complex

12:38.440 --> 12:44.960
the phenomena's and the basic principles could actually be very very simple in

12:44.960 --> 12:49.440
components yes yes so what I'm hearing from you and this is this really does

12:49.440 --> 12:54.320
make sense is that whereas we might say that because it's a living cell it has

12:54.320 --> 12:59.360
a complex communication with its neighboring cell you have shown that

12:59.360 --> 13:03.920
these two drops which are obviously not living cells still have communication

13:03.920 --> 13:09.400
challenges and we may not need to invoke complex cellular communication to

13:09.400 --> 13:13.640
explain some of the phenomenon that we see yeah and even to a point where not

13:13.640 --> 13:19.160
only do they sense then based on that signal you act on it and you can move

13:19.160 --> 13:24.440
and you can sense quite literally the same phenomena that white blood cells are

13:24.440 --> 13:28.840
doing trying to chase bacteria during an infection an infection we replicate with

13:28.840 --> 13:32.320
two drops of water this is the future of everything I'm Russ Alvin I'm speaking

13:32.320 --> 13:36.600
with Dr. Manu Prakash from bioengineering at Stanford I know a little

13:36.600 --> 13:39.800
bit about your work and I know that that droplet work has also led to some

13:39.800 --> 13:44.160
intriguing demonstrations of doing computation with droplets can you give

13:44.160 --> 13:47.400
us a sense of what the heck I mean I think of computation as silicon

13:47.400 --> 13:52.840
electrons transistors but you've written papers about how droplets can be used to

13:52.840 --> 13:57.480
simulate some of not simulate to perform some of the functions that we have

13:57.520 --> 14:03.480
traditionally associate with silicon and transistors tell us about that yeah so

14:03.480 --> 14:07.880
you know when we think of a computer we're thinking of processing information

14:07.880 --> 14:12.480
and that information revolution has led us here but there is a bit that got

14:12.480 --> 14:19.000
missed out which is that every bit in a computer is also physical you know every

14:19.000 --> 14:23.680
electron that's running around you can make optical computers photons running

14:23.720 --> 14:30.280
around and I had this notion of thinking about could we use computation to

14:30.280 --> 14:35.160
actually assemble matter if that bit could be a grocery bag that I could put

14:35.160 --> 14:39.640
molecules and another things in run a computation and walla instead of getting

14:39.640 --> 14:44.880
a number out I would get an object out so that's been the mission for the last

14:44.880 --> 14:48.600
12 years have been working on this and at this point we're at a stage where we

14:48.600 --> 14:53.920
have demonstrated universal synchronous computation using these droplets that

14:53.920 --> 14:58.480
interact with each other they form all kinds of logic gates they're completely

14:58.480 --> 15:03.840
modular so the system is scalable but the goal is not wordpress or word

15:03.840 --> 15:09.240
processing but the goal is to actually build using this material so imagine you

15:09.240 --> 15:14.480
write a little two-line code that codes for the Serpentski triangle but I have

15:14.520 --> 15:19.520
no idea what that is so you can think of the Pascal triangle for example or you

15:19.520 --> 15:23.480
could think of a fractal yes it's a fractal like structure with a

15:23.480 --> 15:28.560
hierarchical structure and if I was to place every element of that fractal one

15:28.560 --> 15:32.560
at a time serially which is what 3d printing kind of tries to do it would

15:32.560 --> 15:36.480
take forever forever but if you can teach it to do the computation it

15:36.480 --> 15:41.440
algorithmically builds and local parts interact with each other to build a

15:41.480 --> 15:45.720
local structure that interacts with the rest of it so just to help us just I

15:45.720 --> 15:49.360
just want to go a little bit more for this computation with droplets so is it

15:49.360 --> 15:53.760
the is the right analogy that in the same way that we have wires with electrons

15:53.760 --> 15:57.400
moving on them and we get the electrons to go to the left to the right and by

15:57.400 --> 16:02.920
bringing them together they can do ads or subtracts or other numerical that you

16:02.920 --> 16:07.440
can get the droplets to flow through perhaps like a microfluidic channel split

16:07.760 --> 16:12.360
come together and do very similar things as what electrons are doing in wire is

16:12.360 --> 16:17.440
that the general yeah that's a that's a good basic way of describing this and

16:17.440 --> 16:21.160
the droplets are interacting with each other just like electrons interact with

16:21.160 --> 16:25.440
electromagnetic fields and charges they're interacting with hydrodynamic

16:25.440 --> 16:29.880
fields and in the latest system we demonstrated there actually there are no

16:29.880 --> 16:35.080
wires that it's essentially a flat surface of water that they're moving

16:35.080 --> 16:39.560
around and because they're interacting with each other they provide the

16:39.560 --> 16:44.400
structure they need and we inject energy in the system in a way to control it

16:44.400 --> 16:51.680
from outside unbelievable so we can look forward to these computational fluid

16:51.680 --> 16:56.600
systems that are helping us get solve problems through an analogy with

16:56.600 --> 17:00.840
electronic computer systems yeah sort of my hope is that we're able to build

17:00.840 --> 17:04.640
some of these systems that can make materials that we've never been able to

17:04.680 --> 17:09.280
make for example heterogeneous material you know like my hand right has

17:09.280 --> 17:13.320
thousands of different materials multi-component we don't know we're

17:13.320 --> 17:17.680
close to that in the context of our manufacturing capability so speaking of

17:17.680 --> 17:21.480
manufacturing capabilities I want to move to the part that everybody loves

17:21.480 --> 17:26.800
when they talk to you which is your focus on what we call frugal science and

17:26.800 --> 17:32.040
the creation of devices using the rules of physics but with an extreme emphasis

17:32.040 --> 17:35.800
on affordability and I think the one of the first ones that first of all the

17:35.800 --> 17:39.160
computation with fluids could be that already but let's move to a something

17:39.160 --> 17:43.320
that got a lot of press which was your creation of the fold scope can you tell

17:43.320 --> 17:49.600
us what the fold scope is and why it exists yeah so I think we have one in

17:49.600 --> 17:52.600
front of us that's correct we have something sitting here and you should

17:52.600 --> 17:57.160
think of this as a pencil of microscopy you know many of many of us are

17:57.160 --> 18:01.400
carrying pencils and pens around and it's important you know it's a point of

18:01.400 --> 18:06.920
making about literacy that I can have my thoughts be heard and seen and share

18:06.920 --> 18:12.240
it's a tool and very much what ends up happening in science sometimes with you

18:12.240 --> 18:16.920
know two billion kids on this planet and one billion of them technically living

18:16.920 --> 18:22.040
under poverty it starts realizing this idea that access to science is not a

18:22.040 --> 18:27.120
common thing we're just the lucky ones who sort of made it through somebody you

18:27.160 --> 18:31.960
know helped us along and we're here and billions of other kids can also be here

18:31.960 --> 18:35.320
except at the same time they haven't had the access and they don't have the tools

18:35.320 --> 18:39.760
and they don't have the tools there are a lot of knowledge and actually the

18:39.760 --> 18:43.960
information revolution is really changing that Wikipedia Khan Academy many

18:43.960 --> 18:49.200
of these miracles of knowledge there's incredible knowledge but science

18:49.200 --> 18:53.600
composed of knowledge and experience and we're missing the experience without

18:53.760 --> 18:57.280
the experience there is no aha moment without an aha moment I wouldn't be

18:57.280 --> 19:02.800
sitting here so what we decided to do almost six years ago now is to make a

19:02.800 --> 19:09.320
microscope that was gonna cost a dollar and can do resolutions that are sub

19:09.320 --> 19:13.640
cellular and there was this challenge of let's do something where cost and

19:13.640 --> 19:18.880
performance really try to push the limits yes and this is where comes in a

19:18.960 --> 19:23.920
new manufacturing tools so fold scope is an origami microscope so I for those of

19:23.920 --> 19:28.240
you can't see we are looking at what looks like a bunch of cutout paper and

19:28.240 --> 19:32.480
colorful and it has a bunch of cutouts and this you should think of this as

19:32.480 --> 19:36.800
art and craft essentially that it should feel so natural to you it's a piece of

19:36.800 --> 19:41.760
paper you can drop it bang on it but then once it's folded together there's a

19:41.760 --> 19:46.360
little place I insert a little slide of water that I just collected outside I

19:46.400 --> 19:52.120
clip it on and at this point is now holding up to his eye this little piece

19:52.120 --> 19:57.160
of cardboard and I have transported into a new world for a second I forgot about

19:57.160 --> 20:05.440
your eyes because I was watching single cells of a moss which is a plant like

20:05.440 --> 20:10.320
structure but except that little tiles of little pieces of bricks all assembled

20:10.320 --> 20:13.680
together so let me clarify if I may hold that for a moment yeah I'm gonna

20:13.720 --> 20:18.720
actually give this to you I've lost him he is in the microbiome hold here and

20:18.720 --> 20:22.680
here on the two sides and just bring it close to your eye pointing to the light

20:22.680 --> 20:26.600
so let me just first describe that this is fundamentally made out of a kind of

20:26.600 --> 20:31.480
card subcard board grade paper like a what you might get a greeting card on it's

20:31.480 --> 20:36.240
an elaborate folded piece with there but in the middle there is something that's

20:36.240 --> 20:40.040
not paper and I want you to because I don't this is not magic there's still I

20:40.080 --> 20:44.960
guess a lens so could you tell us about the lens set up what it's made out of and

20:44.960 --> 20:49.000
I is that an expensive component or is that not expensive no so I think one of

20:49.000 --> 20:53.160
the questions we really asked ourselves is given constraints in physics and this

20:53.160 --> 20:57.160
is why I call it frugal science because there's a lot of rigor that went into

20:57.160 --> 21:04.000
manufacturing this lens I am seeing things in this lens and one of the threads

21:04.000 --> 21:08.160
that you start thinking about is given two optical surfaces what is the

21:08.800 --> 21:13.320
theoretical resolution best possible resolution you can achieve so you had to

21:13.320 --> 21:17.880
use pretty deep optical theory so we solve that analytical equation that took

21:17.880 --> 21:22.640
33 pages to solve but then once you have it we have a design tool that suddenly

21:22.640 --> 21:26.720
and so rather than asking that I will keep piling up pieces of glass after

21:26.720 --> 21:31.480
glass we asked a question given minimal number of surfaces what is the best thing

21:31.480 --> 21:36.280
you can do and then we built robots this would not be possible because at this

21:36.320 --> 21:41.000
point in the lab itself we shipped around 80,000 of these instruments around

21:41.000 --> 21:46.680
the world how much do they cost so at so we as a disclosure we spun off last year

21:46.680 --> 21:49.920
as a startup company that I'm a co-founder of and at this point for a

21:49.920 --> 21:55.160
$1.50 you can buy a full scope and is that is that an actual piece of glass

21:55.160 --> 22:00.920
that's correct the last lenses it has magnetic couplers it couples to your

22:00.920 --> 22:04.920
phone so you can share the data with friends now for people who have used a

22:04.920 --> 22:09.240
microscope and they know that there's like 10x 40x 100x what is this this

22:09.240 --> 22:14.200
would be equivalent to 140x objective okay and the thing that you start

22:14.200 --> 22:19.600
thinking about is the data that we collect is I can watch individual bacteria

22:19.600 --> 22:23.240
so if we had more time I would have asked you to give me a little spit sample

22:23.240 --> 22:27.480
and then we would have watched single bacteria swimming around and you know and

22:27.480 --> 22:31.200
then and the magnification is sufficient sufficient enough to actually watch

22:31.520 --> 22:35.640
bacteria was this motivated by a real health need or is this mostly for the

22:35.640 --> 22:40.200
education of the youth no I think it's both and it was this realization that

22:40.200 --> 22:45.600
you cannot provide health surfaces around the world if you don't provide

22:45.600 --> 22:50.040
health education if you don't provide I mean I've been out in the field many

22:50.040 --> 22:53.680
times with the fancy hospital in the middle of nowhere but the patients

22:53.680 --> 22:58.080
don't even believe in medicine they have never experienced the germ theory for

22:58.080 --> 23:02.600
that matter you know so seeing a germ might be a transformational experience

23:02.600 --> 23:06.160
for them so there is a social context to this which is really we should open up

23:06.160 --> 23:10.480
science so people get a chance to really understand the beginnings and at that

23:10.480 --> 23:15.680
same time the same sets of tools that are Peruvian doctors who have used this

23:15.680 --> 23:19.880
for cervical cancer we have demonstrated diagnostics applications for these not

23:19.880 --> 23:25.520
just for humans but for plants and animals there is a sailor right now in

23:25.760 --> 23:31.120
the middle of the Pacific Ocean fold scoping on his you know 15-foot boat

23:31.120 --> 23:34.920
unbelievable now can you give me an example of what kind of diagnosis might

23:34.920 --> 23:39.360
a fold scope be capable of making yeah so any stool samples for example if you

23:39.360 --> 23:43.600
really start thinking about from the very beginning of where we started this

23:43.600 --> 23:49.160
the question of helmet infections eggs and stool you can start with urine

23:49.160 --> 23:53.000
absolutely and I think one of the threads is we've demonstrated we can

23:53.040 --> 23:58.640
even image malaria parasites we can image many blood-borne pathogens one of

23:58.640 --> 24:01.720
the things that we have and I want to stress when he says image when you say

24:01.720 --> 24:05.560
image you're talking about with this one dollar and 50 cent cardboard plus a

24:05.560 --> 24:09.280
piece of glass and a piece of metal yeah and one of the things that's valuable

24:09.280 --> 24:13.200
about diagnostics when we started doing this is we realize diagnostics is about

24:13.200 --> 24:17.680
searching for a needle in a haystack and sometimes if the needle is right in

24:17.680 --> 24:21.920
front of your lens you could to see it but sometimes it's not so we invented a

24:21.960 --> 24:26.240
way to around that to find the needle this is the future of everything I'm

24:26.240 --> 24:30.600
Russ Altman and I'm speaking with Manu Prakash about how physics can turn into

24:30.600 --> 24:35.240
extreme frugal instrumentation so you were just about to talk about a new

24:35.240 --> 24:40.120
device I believe it's called the paper huge what's the paper fuge all about

24:40.120 --> 24:44.720
yeah so it sort of stems from this idea that if you're searching for a needle in

24:44.720 --> 24:48.320
a haystack if you could just pick out the needle then you won't be searching

24:48.520 --> 24:53.000
anymore and that process in the scientific context is called centrifugation so

24:53.000 --> 24:57.160
that's usually I think of a big machine that spins very fast and it separates

24:57.160 --> 25:01.120
the thicker things go to the bottom the thinner things stay at the top and we

25:01.120 --> 25:06.560
are able to separate yes and so by density and it turns out parasites have

25:06.560 --> 25:11.080
different density than our native cells so if there is one blood cell that has

25:11.080 --> 25:16.440
a malaria parasite the density has changed now and we'll be able to pull that

25:16.440 --> 25:20.440
out by separating by separating it but now the question is if I'm in the

25:20.440 --> 25:25.560
middle of nowhere under a tree with no electricity no power no nothing that big

25:25.560 --> 25:29.000
centrifuge that I described is not an option that's correct it's not an option

25:29.000 --> 25:32.920
I'm looking at Manu and he's holding an odd-looking thing which I'm sure he's

25:32.920 --> 25:37.800
about to talk about when I shut up but it looks like two cylindrical cardboard

25:37.800 --> 25:41.160
pieces with string and then something in the middle what are we looking at Manu

25:41.560 --> 25:47.760
you are looking at one of the oldest toy in the history of mankind this is a

25:47.760 --> 25:53.000
5,000 year old toy which in many cultures is called button on a string and we

25:53.000 --> 25:58.080
made this realization that if we study all possible toys that spin could we

25:58.080 --> 26:03.920
mathematically write down equations to beat the world record for fastest

26:03.920 --> 26:08.080
spinning object in human with human power human engineered oh and human

26:08.320 --> 26:14.160
powered so we have this object that I'm now spinning it is spinning very fast

26:14.160 --> 26:18.560
he's doing kind of a back-and-forth motion with the string and the central

26:18.560 --> 26:23.920
disc is spinning I have no idea I'm sure Manu will tell us very fast yeah so

26:23.920 --> 26:30.080
this specific one right now itself was spinning around 20,000 rpm 20,000

26:30.080 --> 26:34.440
rotations per minute and then there are many versions of this we make and our

26:34.520 --> 26:39.960
fastest spinning one is actually 125,000 rpm now does that actually set the

26:39.960 --> 26:43.640
record you were seeking that is correct that sets the world record at this point

26:43.640 --> 26:47.640
for the fastest spinning object and I think the reason I'm stressing this is I

26:47.640 --> 26:52.040
really do want people to break that record right if we were a challenge it is a

26:52.040 --> 26:58.280
challenge and of course it took us again going back to the rigor 20 bits of

26:58.280 --> 27:01.960
equations to really describe the parameters because although people had

27:02.840 --> 27:06.280
played with this toy nobody had asked this question how this toy actually works

27:07.000 --> 27:11.880
and so you know the joy going back to the beauty in science is the joy for us was

27:11.880 --> 27:15.560
really figuring that out and of course there is a phenomenal outcome of that

27:15.560 --> 27:19.560
but I would have been happy just figuring out the toy as well so we set the record

27:19.560 --> 27:23.960
for rotations but I guess it begs the question are we able to use this device to

27:23.960 --> 27:28.280
do the kinds of separations you described to actually make some kind of useful

27:28.280 --> 27:32.440
diagnoses find that heavy malarial cell if you will yeah so I think they're in

27:32.440 --> 27:36.840
here if some of you can see there's a little glass slide a glass capillary that

27:36.840 --> 27:41.320
I had put and if we had more point time and I had my lancet I would have done a

27:41.320 --> 27:46.200
little finger prick take the capillary fill the blood within 90 seconds of

27:46.200 --> 27:50.760
going back and forth going back and forth we have separated all of blood plasma

27:50.760 --> 27:55.720
from the blood cells itself and pure plasma is extremely useful and important

27:55.720 --> 28:00.040
for rdt tests all these rapid diagnostics yes because all the enzymes have to get

28:00.040 --> 28:04.040
rid of the red blood cells and you want kind of the clear fluid that you get this

28:04.040 --> 28:08.200
fantastic sensitivity and specificity using that and then of course if we just

28:08.200 --> 28:12.920
spend for a little bit longer for around between seven to ten minutes you

28:12.920 --> 28:17.160
actually separate out every single malaria parasite malaria is a tough one

28:17.160 --> 28:21.080
because it's a really tiny parasite but that in itself this thing is spinning

28:21.080 --> 28:28.200
around 30 000 g forces 30 000 g that's correct so you are experiencing if you

28:28.200 --> 28:31.880
were that little cell you're experiencing a very high force well this is just

28:31.880 --> 28:37.560
fantastic because we've gone from a very for the lack of a better phrase high

28:37.560 --> 28:43.000
falutin conception of what physics can bring to biology to a series of

28:43.000 --> 28:47.640
inventions that are bringing science and the ability to make uh experiential

28:47.640 --> 28:51.400
observations really globally to everyone in the world who has any interest in

28:51.400 --> 28:54.120
