1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,200
from the campus of stanford university people are worried about data they're

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,600
worried about their privacy and their security they should be we need secure

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,360
systems this is the future of everything but we can't have a system that

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,720
closes that data off it is too rich of a source of inspiration innovation and

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,200
discovery for new things in medicine today on the future of everything the

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,800
future of using physics to understand biology and to build new devices now

7
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,040
when we think of physics we often think of the study of fundamental forces in

8
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:51,080
the world gravity the theory of relativity electricity the big bang

9
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,960
black holes dark matter we may think about the big experimental facilities

10
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,880
around the world big telescopes particle beams and linear accelerators the

11
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:07,040
detection of cosmic events black holes we may not think however about biology

12
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,080
biological systems of course of course must obey the rules of physics but

13
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,520
somehow those rules seem distant and not directly applicable in biological

14
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,400
systems we may not always think of a physicist studying fundamental forces

15
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,440
relevant to biology life on earth and creating devices for measuring these

16
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:33,440
phenomenon but of course physicists do do this indeed life on earth has had to

17
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,040
evolve in response I'm saying obvious things here to the physical world to

18
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,600
solve some remarkable problems how do we encode the shapes of living organisms

19
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,520
so that with just their DNA with just their genome they can

20
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:54,040
reproducibly form their expected shape how can living organisms work with water

21
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,480
water is a fascinating substance it has special properties in terms of its

22
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,960
chemical makeup its electrical activity how it interacts with itself and its

23
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,120
ability to host other molecules that are dissolved within it how can we build

24
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,240
physical systems in living systems that perceive signals how do we perceive

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,400
visual signals audio signals touch taste these must all be sensed at a

26
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,040
molecular physical level and then integrated into useful signals that

27
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,480
the organism can then integrate to figure out the key things like where's the

28
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,960
light where's the food pretty much that's actually that's pretty much

29
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,160
everything where's the light where's the food where's the mate so these are the

30
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,880
basic functions of living systems now a fascinating branch of biology is the

31
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,400
study of how biological systems take advantage of physics to accomplish

32
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,680
complex tasks tasks that appear to be difficult or even impossible so what am

33
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,480
I talking about well this includes the study of self-assembly where individual

34
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,120
units of a biological system can create a complex structure without any

35
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,880
explicit instructions let me give an example there are viruses spherical

36
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:13,360
viruses that are particles made up of 180 identical subunits that form these

37
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,280
beautiful perfect spheres that contain these beautiful perfect spheres that

38
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,600
contain the DNA that makes the virus infectious just based on how these

39
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,200
individual proteins they are interact with one another they can spontaneously

40
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,400
form these shells there's no need to build a scaffold there's no need to say

41
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,400
okay now you go there you go there they just kind of because of their intrinsic

42
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,120
physical features they assemble with one another and they form these spheres

43
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,520
similarly the outer membrane of a cell which is lipids that create a boundary

44
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,440
between the inside and the outside of the cell are made of lipid molecules that

45
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:59,400
self-assemble to form these compartments that support the living machinery

46
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,640
imagine having a bunch of fabric and saying could you please make me a tent

47
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,800
and whoosh the fabric spontaneously forms a tent in the case of the virus

48
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,080
imagine just having pieces Lego pieces lying around which will spontaneously

49
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,400
form a sphere without any effort this is what happens in many times in biology

50
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,880
or how DNA of course forms these beautiful double helices that look a lot

51
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,840
like helical staircases imagine wanting a helical staircase in your mansion not a

52
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,880
problem that I have where you just get all the materials and they self-assemble

53
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,880
into a beautiful double helix without any instruction we do not understand all

54
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,480
the ways in which by lock biological systems have harnessed physics to solve

55
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,080
these problems but we have examples where where it has this is worth

56
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,880
understanding big both because of natural curiosity of how biological systems

57
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,560
work and because it may elucidate principles that allow us to take

58
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,400
advantage of these same are the of these rules to build devices and new

59
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,320
capabilities in in our world that can advance our technology and our

60
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,160
understanding my guest today is professor Manu Prakash from the

61
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,520
department of bioengineering at Stanford University and Manu is an expert

62
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,800
physicist working on biological systems he studies the physics of biological

63
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,880
systems at the molecular cellular and tissue level and he also takes the

64
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,080
insights that he learns from this deep dive into the physics of biological

65
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,920
systems to build cool devices we'll get to the devices but Manu as someone who

66
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,480
trained as a physicist applied physics what drew you to biological systems and

67
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,920
what do you tell your fellow physicists about what's exciting or challenging

68
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:55,960
about biology you know it's once in a life you get this moment where you take

69
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,200
a backseat and you think you know what do you want your life to be and that

70
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,120
happens a couple of times in our lives and that happened to me right after grad

71
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:12,480
school and anybody who's peered through a microscope would know that there is a

72
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,560
piece of matter that we do not understand that we cannot write down a

73
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:26,200
bunch of equations to explain and it's so us you know biology so us so I mean you

74
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,080
know I was studying many different things in the past but that that emotional

75
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,600
connection you have with aha you know not only am I trying to understand this

76
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,120
piece of matter but my act of understanding it is that piece of matter

77
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,600
very meta yeah that was that's the philosophical times that you go in and

78
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,240
then you ask this is what I want to do for my life and I think I find it's a

79
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,000
little bit strange sometimes I mean you're right I have to explain some

80
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,320
times to my physics friends that hey this is the most exciting thing in the

81
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,280
world and sometimes I think that sense of wonder if you just share that sense of

82
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,400
wonder first yes I mean the aesthetic and beauty in biology is incredible and

83
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,120
if you're not working on a beautiful problem then you know find a new problem

84
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,160
now I want to give you credit though because I know many physicists who take

85
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,040
a little they dip their toes into biology they love mathematical equations

86
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:28,160
that explain the world if you've taken any physics you know f equals ma it's

87
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,720
very famous force equals mass times acceleration based on that very simple

88
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,920
equation you can derive how we got men to the moon how we build devices that

89
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,320
work and that don't break and and sometimes my physics friends that you

90
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:47,080
know biology is too squishy there's no right angles there's no real underlying

91
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,360
mathematical formalism and I'm out I'm sorry yeah this did not happen to you

92
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:59,640
yeah or did it not yet not yet I think I'm naive and I am perfectly happy being

93
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,080
naive sometimes and I mean I actually tell most of my students you have to be

94
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,920
naive sometimes to have the guts that we will try to understand this piece of

95
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:16,400
matter and I think I mean to your point about the complexity it's it is what

96
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,120
makes biology so much more fun that although there are these rules there is

97
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:28,200
every time an exception to that rule yes and I find that fascinating so so you

98
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,520
have worked on this self-assembly issue I talked about the viruses and some

99
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,800
other things tell us what what is the state of our understanding of self

100
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,880
assembling systems and are we just at at a baby point or are we beginning to

101
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,000
really understand the what's going on when these systems do these amazing

102
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:50,560
activities of creating complex objects from simple subunits yeah so I mean I

103
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,200
would argue we're really at the beginning and the reason for that is most

104
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,160
of our insights initially in that field have come from just watching biology

105
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,960
the fact that now we have the capability of really ripping apart a virus

106
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,440
particle and really see the sets of components gives us the sense that we

107
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,600
are starting to understand the list of components but how they come together

108
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,040
and build things that are not one even two or three orders of magnitude larger

109
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,960
than the component like your example of truly bringing a grant grand staircase

110
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:29,880
from a point of view of a molecule a cell is a gigantic staircase we don't

111
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,960
really understand where these lens scales are set up you know where is that

112
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:39,520
encoded shape and form at higher levels hierarchy has been really fantastic so I

113
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:45,080
think we we don't exploit that too much in and I think the other aspect of the

114
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:51,160
field has really grown when we had tried to take small components and then ask

115
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,120
ourselves we are going to build something out of it so for example the

116
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,440
entire world of DNA all algorithmic assembly or even general ideas where you

117
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,360
take and now make components that are literally dead but still demonstrate the

118
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,040
principles that's where the most exciting bits that I see because I start to see

119
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,280
an inkling of things that we would never been able to manufacture before this is

120
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,200
the future everything of everything I'm Russ Altman I'm speaking with Professor

121
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,800
Manu Prakash about physics and its influences these days on biology what

122
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,920
is your favorite current system to look at to understand self-assembly I'm

123
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,840
trying to get this down to a real system that you find fascinating that you think

124
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:39,280
you might be able to understand yeah so this is kind of it's slightly ironic but

125
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,920
sometimes what ends up happening is the biology inspires an insight and then you

126
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,120
can take that insight and even work on that system in an abiotic manner

127
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,640
non-biological non-biological and so there is a system in the lab that we've

128
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,160
been trying to build now for several years to really demonstrate that we can

129
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:06,400
do algorithmic self-assembly using droplets droplets yeah there is a two

130
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:11,440
years ago we demonstrated a type of an active droplet system that demonstrates

131
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,960
are you talking about fluid droplets that's correct fluid droplets but they

132
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,280
can actually be phase droplets they can be protein droplets very fluid like phases

133
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,160
that demonstrate very phenomena that you would not be able to distinguish from

134
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,920
chemotaxis for example they can sense each other they can crawl they can chase

135
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,040
each other but they're not living they're just physical literally small bits

136
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,440
molecules of fluid and they're communicating with each other now

137
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,680
that sounds like magic you got you have to tell us I have to stop you then you

138
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,160
have to give us a sense of how that could possibly happen yeah so you can do

139
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,120
this in your kitchen go right now and find some food coloring in your kitchen

140
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,000
and some water and mix it up on a clean glass slide and put these two drops next

141
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,560
to each other in a few moments you will notice that these two food coloring

142
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,720
droplets will be talking to each other what they do is they send out a water

143
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,320
signal there is a vapor cloud around it vapor cloud yes and that vapor cloud is

144
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,800
interacting and there is more vapor between the two than around the

145
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,320
surroundings and that leads to this incredible phenomena which is not so

146
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,920
far from retrograde flows in cells where cells are these engines with all these

147
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:32,880
motors moving around but this purely arises in a physical system and so the

148
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,440
reason I brought that example is sometimes we although biology is complex

149
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:44,960
the phenomena's and the basic principles could actually be very very simple in

150
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,440
components yes yes so what I'm hearing from you and this is this really does

151
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,320
make sense is that whereas we might say that because it's a living cell it has

152
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,360
a complex communication with its neighboring cell you have shown that

153
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,920
these two drops which are obviously not living cells still have communication

154
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,400
challenges and we may not need to invoke complex cellular communication to

155
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,640
explain some of the phenomenon that we see yeah and even to a point where not

156
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:19,160
only do they sense then based on that signal you act on it and you can move

157
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,440
and you can sense quite literally the same phenomena that white blood cells are

158
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,840
doing trying to chase bacteria during an infection an infection we replicate with

159
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,320
two drops of water this is the future of everything I'm Russ Alvin I'm speaking

160
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,600
with Dr. Manu Prakash from bioengineering at Stanford I know a little

161
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,800
bit about your work and I know that that droplet work has also led to some

162
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,160
intriguing demonstrations of doing computation with droplets can you give

163
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,400
us a sense of what the heck I mean I think of computation as silicon

164
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,840
electrons transistors but you've written papers about how droplets can be used to

165
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,480
simulate some of not simulate to perform some of the functions that we have

166
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:03,480
traditionally associate with silicon and transistors tell us about that yeah so

167
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,880
you know when we think of a computer we're thinking of processing information

168
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,480
and that information revolution has led us here but there is a bit that got

169
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:19,000
missed out which is that every bit in a computer is also physical you know every

170
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,680
electron that's running around you can make optical computers photons running

171
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:30,280
around and I had this notion of thinking about could we use computation to

172
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:35,160
actually assemble matter if that bit could be a grocery bag that I could put

173
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,640
molecules and another things in run a computation and walla instead of getting

174
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,880
a number out I would get an object out so that's been the mission for the last

175
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,600
12 years have been working on this and at this point we're at a stage where we

176
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,920
have demonstrated universal synchronous computation using these droplets that

177
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,480
interact with each other they form all kinds of logic gates they're completely

178
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,840
modular so the system is scalable but the goal is not wordpress or word

179
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:09,240
processing but the goal is to actually build using this material so imagine you

180
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,480
write a little two-line code that codes for the Serpentski triangle but I have

181
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:19,520
no idea what that is so you can think of the Pascal triangle for example or you

182
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,480
could think of a fractal yes it's a fractal like structure with a

183
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,560
hierarchical structure and if I was to place every element of that fractal one

184
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,560
at a time serially which is what 3d printing kind of tries to do it would

185
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,480
take forever forever but if you can teach it to do the computation it

186
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,440
algorithmically builds and local parts interact with each other to build a

187
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,720
local structure that interacts with the rest of it so just to help us just I

188
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,360
just want to go a little bit more for this computation with droplets so is it

189
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,760
the is the right analogy that in the same way that we have wires with electrons

190
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,400
moving on them and we get the electrons to go to the left to the right and by

191
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,920
bringing them together they can do ads or subtracts or other numerical that you

192
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,440
can get the droplets to flow through perhaps like a microfluidic channel split

193
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,360
come together and do very similar things as what electrons are doing in wire is

194
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,440
that the general yeah that's a that's a good basic way of describing this and

195
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,160
the droplets are interacting with each other just like electrons interact with

196
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,440
electromagnetic fields and charges they're interacting with hydrodynamic

197
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,880
fields and in the latest system we demonstrated there actually there are no

198
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:35,080
wires that it's essentially a flat surface of water that they're moving

199
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,560
around and because they're interacting with each other they provide the

200
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,400
structure they need and we inject energy in the system in a way to control it

201
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:51,680
from outside unbelievable so we can look forward to these computational fluid

202
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,600
systems that are helping us get solve problems through an analogy with

203
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,840
electronic computer systems yeah sort of my hope is that we're able to build

204
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,640
some of these systems that can make materials that we've never been able to

205
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:09,280
make for example heterogeneous material you know like my hand right has

206
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,320
thousands of different materials multi-component we don't know we're

207
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,680
close to that in the context of our manufacturing capability so speaking of

208
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,480
manufacturing capabilities I want to move to the part that everybody loves

209
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,800
when they talk to you which is your focus on what we call frugal science and

210
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:32,040
the creation of devices using the rules of physics but with an extreme emphasis

211
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,800
on affordability and I think the one of the first ones that first of all the

212
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,160
computation with fluids could be that already but let's move to a something

213
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,320
that got a lot of press which was your creation of the fold scope can you tell

214
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:49,600
us what the fold scope is and why it exists yeah so I think we have one in

215
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,600
front of us that's correct we have something sitting here and you should

216
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,160
think of this as a pencil of microscopy you know many of many of us are

217
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,400
carrying pencils and pens around and it's important you know it's a point of

218
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,920
making about literacy that I can have my thoughts be heard and seen and share

219
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:12,240
it's a tool and very much what ends up happening in science sometimes with you

220
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,920
know two billion kids on this planet and one billion of them technically living

221
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:22,040
under poverty it starts realizing this idea that access to science is not a

222
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:27,120
common thing we're just the lucky ones who sort of made it through somebody you

223
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,960
know helped us along and we're here and billions of other kids can also be here

224
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,320
except at the same time they haven't had the access and they don't have the tools

225
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,760
and they don't have the tools there are a lot of knowledge and actually the

226
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,960
information revolution is really changing that Wikipedia Khan Academy many

227
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,200
of these miracles of knowledge there's incredible knowledge but science

228
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,600
composed of knowledge and experience and we're missing the experience without

229
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,280
the experience there is no aha moment without an aha moment I wouldn't be

230
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,800
sitting here so what we decided to do almost six years ago now is to make a

231
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:09,320
microscope that was gonna cost a dollar and can do resolutions that are sub

232
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,640
cellular and there was this challenge of let's do something where cost and

233
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,880
performance really try to push the limits yes and this is where comes in a

234
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,920
new manufacturing tools so fold scope is an origami microscope so I for those of

235
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,240
you can't see we are looking at what looks like a bunch of cutout paper and

236
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,480
colorful and it has a bunch of cutouts and this you should think of this as

237
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,800
art and craft essentially that it should feel so natural to you it's a piece of

238
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,760
paper you can drop it bang on it but then once it's folded together there's a

239
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,360
little place I insert a little slide of water that I just collected outside I

240
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,120
clip it on and at this point is now holding up to his eye this little piece

241
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:57,160
of cardboard and I have transported into a new world for a second I forgot about

242
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:05,440
your eyes because I was watching single cells of a moss which is a plant like

243
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,320
structure but except that little tiles of little pieces of bricks all assembled

244
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,680
together so let me clarify if I may hold that for a moment yeah I'm gonna

245
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,720
actually give this to you I've lost him he is in the microbiome hold here and

246
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,680
here on the two sides and just bring it close to your eye pointing to the light

247
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,600
so let me just first describe that this is fundamentally made out of a kind of

248
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,480
card subcard board grade paper like a what you might get a greeting card on it's

249
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,240
an elaborate folded piece with there but in the middle there is something that's

250
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,040
not paper and I want you to because I don't this is not magic there's still I

251
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,960
guess a lens so could you tell us about the lens set up what it's made out of and

252
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,000
I is that an expensive component or is that not expensive no so I think one of

253
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,160
the questions we really asked ourselves is given constraints in physics and this

254
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,160
is why I call it frugal science because there's a lot of rigor that went into

255
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:04,000
manufacturing this lens I am seeing things in this lens and one of the threads

256
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,160
that you start thinking about is given two optical surfaces what is the

257
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,320
theoretical resolution best possible resolution you can achieve so you had to

258
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,880
use pretty deep optical theory so we solve that analytical equation that took

259
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,640
33 pages to solve but then once you have it we have a design tool that suddenly

260
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,720
and so rather than asking that I will keep piling up pieces of glass after

261
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,480
glass we asked a question given minimal number of surfaces what is the best thing

262
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:36,280
you can do and then we built robots this would not be possible because at this

263
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,000
point in the lab itself we shipped around 80,000 of these instruments around

264
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,680
the world how much do they cost so at so we as a disclosure we spun off last year

265
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,920
as a startup company that I'm a co-founder of and at this point for a

266
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:55,160
$1.50 you can buy a full scope and is that is that an actual piece of glass

267
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:00,920
that's correct the last lenses it has magnetic couplers it couples to your

268
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,920
phone so you can share the data with friends now for people who have used a

269
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,240
microscope and they know that there's like 10x 40x 100x what is this this

270
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,200
would be equivalent to 140x objective okay and the thing that you start

271
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:19,600
thinking about is the data that we collect is I can watch individual bacteria

272
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,240
so if we had more time I would have asked you to give me a little spit sample

273
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,480
and then we would have watched single bacteria swimming around and you know and

274
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,200
then and the magnification is sufficient sufficient enough to actually watch

275
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,640
bacteria was this motivated by a real health need or is this mostly for the

276
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,200
education of the youth no I think it's both and it was this realization that

277
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,600
you cannot provide health surfaces around the world if you don't provide

278
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,040
health education if you don't provide I mean I've been out in the field many

279
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,680
times with the fancy hospital in the middle of nowhere but the patients

280
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,080
don't even believe in medicine they have never experienced the germ theory for

281
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,600
that matter you know so seeing a germ might be a transformational experience

282
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,160
for them so there is a social context to this which is really we should open up

283
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,480
science so people get a chance to really understand the beginnings and at that

284
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,680
same time the same sets of tools that are Peruvian doctors who have used this

285
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,880
for cervical cancer we have demonstrated diagnostics applications for these not

286
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:25,520
just for humans but for plants and animals there is a sailor right now in

287
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,120
the middle of the Pacific Ocean fold scoping on his you know 15-foot boat

288
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,920
unbelievable now can you give me an example of what kind of diagnosis might

289
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,360
a fold scope be capable of making yeah so any stool samples for example if you

290
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,600
really start thinking about from the very beginning of where we started this

291
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,160
the question of helmet infections eggs and stool you can start with urine

292
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,000
absolutely and I think one of the threads is we've demonstrated we can

293
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:58,640
even image malaria parasites we can image many blood-borne pathogens one of

294
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,720
the things that we have and I want to stress when he says image when you say

295
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,560
image you're talking about with this one dollar and 50 cent cardboard plus a

296
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,280
piece of glass and a piece of metal yeah and one of the things that's valuable

297
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,200
about diagnostics when we started doing this is we realize diagnostics is about

298
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,680
searching for a needle in a haystack and sometimes if the needle is right in

299
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,920
front of your lens you could to see it but sometimes it's not so we invented a

300
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,240
way to around that to find the needle this is the future of everything I'm

301
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,600
Russ Altman and I'm speaking with Manu Prakash about how physics can turn into

302
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,240
extreme frugal instrumentation so you were just about to talk about a new

303
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,120
device I believe it's called the paper huge what's the paper fuge all about

304
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,720
yeah so it sort of stems from this idea that if you're searching for a needle in

305
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,320
a haystack if you could just pick out the needle then you won't be searching

306
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,000
anymore and that process in the scientific context is called centrifugation so

307
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,160
that's usually I think of a big machine that spins very fast and it separates

308
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,120
the thicker things go to the bottom the thinner things stay at the top and we

309
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,560
are able to separate yes and so by density and it turns out parasites have

310
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,080
different density than our native cells so if there is one blood cell that has

311
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:16,440
a malaria parasite the density has changed now and we'll be able to pull that

312
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,440
out by separating by separating it but now the question is if I'm in the

313
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,560
middle of nowhere under a tree with no electricity no power no nothing that big

314
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,000
centrifuge that I described is not an option that's correct it's not an option

315
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,920
I'm looking at Manu and he's holding an odd-looking thing which I'm sure he's

316
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:37,800
about to talk about when I shut up but it looks like two cylindrical cardboard

317
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,160
pieces with string and then something in the middle what are we looking at Manu

318
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:47,760
you are looking at one of the oldest toy in the history of mankind this is a

319
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,000
5,000 year old toy which in many cultures is called button on a string and we

320
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,080
made this realization that if we study all possible toys that spin could we

321
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,920
mathematically write down equations to beat the world record for fastest

322
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:08,080
spinning object in human with human power human engineered oh and human

323
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:14,160
powered so we have this object that I'm now spinning it is spinning very fast

324
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,560
he's doing kind of a back-and-forth motion with the string and the central

325
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:23,920
disc is spinning I have no idea I'm sure Manu will tell us very fast yeah so

326
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:30,080
this specific one right now itself was spinning around 20,000 rpm 20,000

327
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,440
rotations per minute and then there are many versions of this we make and our

328
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:39,960
fastest spinning one is actually 125,000 rpm now does that actually set the

329
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,640
record you were seeking that is correct that sets the world record at this point

330
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,640
for the fastest spinning object and I think the reason I'm stressing this is I

331
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,040
really do want people to break that record right if we were a challenge it is a

332
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:58,280
challenge and of course it took us again going back to the rigor 20 bits of

333
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,960
equations to really describe the parameters because although people had

334
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,280
played with this toy nobody had asked this question how this toy actually works

335
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,880
and so you know the joy going back to the beauty in science is the joy for us was

336
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,560
really figuring that out and of course there is a phenomenal outcome of that

337
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,560
but I would have been happy just figuring out the toy as well so we set the record

338
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,960
for rotations but I guess it begs the question are we able to use this device to

339
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,280
do the kinds of separations you described to actually make some kind of useful

340
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:32,440
diagnoses find that heavy malarial cell if you will yeah so I think they're in

341
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,840
here if some of you can see there's a little glass slide a glass capillary that

342
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,320
I had put and if we had more point time and I had my lancet I would have done a

343
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:46,200
little finger prick take the capillary fill the blood within 90 seconds of

344
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,760
going back and forth going back and forth we have separated all of blood plasma

345
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,720
from the blood cells itself and pure plasma is extremely useful and important

346
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,040
for rdt tests all these rapid diagnostics yes because all the enzymes have to get

347
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,040
rid of the red blood cells and you want kind of the clear fluid that you get this

348
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:08,200
fantastic sensitivity and specificity using that and then of course if we just

349
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,920
spend for a little bit longer for around between seven to ten minutes you

350
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,160
actually separate out every single malaria parasite malaria is a tough one

351
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,080
because it's a really tiny parasite but that in itself this thing is spinning

352
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:28,200
around 30 000 g forces 30 000 g that's correct so you are experiencing if you

353
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,880
were that little cell you're experiencing a very high force well this is just

354
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:37,560
fantastic because we've gone from a very for the lack of a better phrase high

355
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:43,000
falutin conception of what physics can bring to biology to a series of

356
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,640
inventions that are bringing science and the ability to make uh experiential

357
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,400
observations really globally to everyone in the world who has any interest in

358
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,120
