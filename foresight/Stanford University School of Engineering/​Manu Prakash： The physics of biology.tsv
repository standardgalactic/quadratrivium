0	15200	from the campus of stanford university people are worried about data they're
15200	18600	worried about their privacy and their security they should be we need secure
18600	23360	systems this is the future of everything but we can't have a system that
23360	28720	closes that data off it is too rich of a source of inspiration innovation and
28720	35200	discovery for new things in medicine today on the future of everything the
35200	41800	future of using physics to understand biology and to build new devices now
41800	46040	when we think of physics we often think of the study of fundamental forces in
46040	51080	the world gravity the theory of relativity electricity the big bang
51080	55960	black holes dark matter we may think about the big experimental facilities
55960	60880	around the world big telescopes particle beams and linear accelerators the
60880	67040	detection of cosmic events black holes we may not think however about biology
67040	73080	biological systems of course of course must obey the rules of physics but
73080	77520	somehow those rules seem distant and not directly applicable in biological
77520	82400	systems we may not always think of a physicist studying fundamental forces
82400	87440	relevant to biology life on earth and creating devices for measuring these
87440	93440	phenomenon but of course physicists do do this indeed life on earth has had to
93440	98040	evolve in response I'm saying obvious things here to the physical world to
98040	103600	solve some remarkable problems how do we encode the shapes of living organisms
103600	107520	so that with just their DNA with just their genome they can
107560	114040	reproducibly form their expected shape how can living organisms work with water
114040	118480	water is a fascinating substance it has special properties in terms of its
118480	123960	chemical makeup its electrical activity how it interacts with itself and its
123960	129120	ability to host other molecules that are dissolved within it how can we build
129120	134240	physical systems in living systems that perceive signals how do we perceive
134400	140400	visual signals audio signals touch taste these must all be sensed at a
140400	145040	molecular physical level and then integrated into useful signals that
145040	149480	the organism can then integrate to figure out the key things like where's the
149480	152960	light where's the food pretty much that's actually that's pretty much
152960	157160	everything where's the light where's the food where's the mate so these are the
157160	161880	basic functions of living systems now a fascinating branch of biology is the
161920	166400	study of how biological systems take advantage of physics to accomplish
166400	172680	complex tasks tasks that appear to be difficult or even impossible so what am
172680	177480	I talking about well this includes the study of self-assembly where individual
177480	183120	units of a biological system can create a complex structure without any
183120	187880	explicit instructions let me give an example there are viruses spherical
187880	193360	viruses that are particles made up of 180 identical subunits that form these
193360	199280	beautiful perfect spheres that contain these beautiful perfect spheres that
199280	205600	contain the DNA that makes the virus infectious just based on how these
205720	211200	individual proteins they are interact with one another they can spontaneously
211200	215400	form these shells there's no need to build a scaffold there's no need to say
215400	220400	okay now you go there you go there they just kind of because of their intrinsic
220400	224120	physical features they assemble with one another and they form these spheres
224120	229520	similarly the outer membrane of a cell which is lipids that create a boundary
229520	234440	between the inside and the outside of the cell are made of lipid molecules that
234440	239400	self-assemble to form these compartments that support the living machinery
239400	243640	imagine having a bunch of fabric and saying could you please make me a tent
243880	248800	and whoosh the fabric spontaneously forms a tent in the case of the virus
248800	253080	imagine just having pieces Lego pieces lying around which will spontaneously
253080	257400	form a sphere without any effort this is what happens in many times in biology
257400	261880	or how DNA of course forms these beautiful double helices that look a lot
261880	266840	like helical staircases imagine wanting a helical staircase in your mansion not a
266840	271880	problem that I have where you just get all the materials and they self-assemble
271920	277880	into a beautiful double helix without any instruction we do not understand all
277880	282480	the ways in which by lock biological systems have harnessed physics to solve
282480	286080	these problems but we have examples where where it has this is worth
286080	290880	understanding big both because of natural curiosity of how biological systems
290880	295560	work and because it may elucidate principles that allow us to take
295560	301400	advantage of these same are the of these rules to build devices and new
301400	306320	capabilities in in our world that can advance our technology and our
306320	312160	understanding my guest today is professor Manu Prakash from the
312160	316520	department of bioengineering at Stanford University and Manu is an expert
316520	321800	physicist working on biological systems he studies the physics of biological
321800	326880	systems at the molecular cellular and tissue level and he also takes the
326880	331080	insights that he learns from this deep dive into the physics of biological
331080	336920	systems to build cool devices we'll get to the devices but Manu as someone who
336920	341480	trained as a physicist applied physics what drew you to biological systems and
341480	346920	what do you tell your fellow physicists about what's exciting or challenging
346920	355960	about biology you know it's once in a life you get this moment where you take
355960	361200	a backseat and you think you know what do you want your life to be and that
361200	365120	happens a couple of times in our lives and that happened to me right after grad
365120	372480	school and anybody who's peered through a microscope would know that there is a
372480	377560	piece of matter that we do not understand that we cannot write down a
377560	386200	bunch of equations to explain and it's so us you know biology so us so I mean you
386200	391080	know I was studying many different things in the past but that that emotional
391080	395600	connection you have with aha you know not only am I trying to understand this
395600	400120	piece of matter but my act of understanding it is that piece of matter
400400	405600	very meta yeah that was that's the philosophical times that you go in and
405600	411240	then you ask this is what I want to do for my life and I think I find it's a
411240	415000	little bit strange sometimes I mean you're right I have to explain some
415000	418320	times to my physics friends that hey this is the most exciting thing in the
418320	423280	world and sometimes I think that sense of wonder if you just share that sense of
423280	428400	wonder first yes I mean the aesthetic and beauty in biology is incredible and
428400	434120	if you're not working on a beautiful problem then you know find a new problem
434120	438160	now I want to give you credit though because I know many physicists who take
438160	444040	a little they dip their toes into biology they love mathematical equations
444040	448160	that explain the world if you've taken any physics you know f equals ma it's
448160	452720	very famous force equals mass times acceleration based on that very simple
452880	457920	equation you can derive how we got men to the moon how we build devices that
457920	461320	work and that don't break and and sometimes my physics friends that you
461320	467080	know biology is too squishy there's no right angles there's no real underlying
467080	472360	mathematical formalism and I'm out I'm sorry yeah this did not happen to you
472360	479640	yeah or did it not yet not yet I think I'm naive and I am perfectly happy being
479680	485080	naive sometimes and I mean I actually tell most of my students you have to be
485080	489920	naive sometimes to have the guts that we will try to understand this piece of
489920	496400	matter and I think I mean to your point about the complexity it's it is what
496400	502120	makes biology so much more fun that although there are these rules there is
502120	508200	every time an exception to that rule yes and I find that fascinating so so you
508280	511520	have worked on this self-assembly issue I talked about the viruses and some
511520	514800	other things tell us what what is the state of our understanding of self
514800	519880	assembling systems and are we just at at a baby point or are we beginning to
519880	524000	really understand the what's going on when these systems do these amazing
524840	530560	activities of creating complex objects from simple subunits yeah so I mean I
530560	535200	would argue we're really at the beginning and the reason for that is most
535200	539160	of our insights initially in that field have come from just watching biology
539680	543960	the fact that now we have the capability of really ripping apart a virus
543960	548440	particle and really see the sets of components gives us the sense that we
548440	552600	are starting to understand the list of components but how they come together
552600	558040	and build things that are not one even two or three orders of magnitude larger
558040	562960	than the component like your example of truly bringing a grant grand staircase
563320	569880	from a point of view of a molecule a cell is a gigantic staircase we don't
569880	573960	really understand where these lens scales are set up you know where is that
573960	579520	encoded shape and form at higher levels hierarchy has been really fantastic so I
579520	585080	think we we don't exploit that too much in and I think the other aspect of the
585080	591160	field has really grown when we had tried to take small components and then ask
591200	595120	ourselves we are going to build something out of it so for example the
595120	601440	entire world of DNA all algorithmic assembly or even general ideas where you
601440	606360	take and now make components that are literally dead but still demonstrate the
606360	611040	principles that's where the most exciting bits that I see because I start to see
611040	615280	an inkling of things that we would never been able to manufacture before this is
615280	619200	the future everything of everything I'm Russ Altman I'm speaking with Professor
619200	623800	Manu Prakash about physics and its influences these days on biology what
623800	627920	is your favorite current system to look at to understand self-assembly I'm
627920	631840	trying to get this down to a real system that you find fascinating that you think
631840	639280	you might be able to understand yeah so this is kind of it's slightly ironic but
639280	644920	sometimes what ends up happening is the biology inspires an insight and then you
644920	649120	can take that insight and even work on that system in an abiotic manner
649120	653640	non-biological non-biological and so there is a system in the lab that we've
653640	658160	been trying to build now for several years to really demonstrate that we can
658160	666400	do algorithmic self-assembly using droplets droplets yeah there is a two
666400	671440	years ago we demonstrated a type of an active droplet system that demonstrates
671440	674960	are you talking about fluid droplets that's correct fluid droplets but they
674960	680280	can actually be phase droplets they can be protein droplets very fluid like phases
680280	685160	that demonstrate very phenomena that you would not be able to distinguish from
685160	690920	chemotaxis for example they can sense each other they can crawl they can chase
690920	696040	each other but they're not living they're just physical literally small bits
696040	700440	molecules of fluid and they're communicating with each other now
700440	703680	that sounds like magic you got you have to tell us I have to stop you then you
703680	708160	have to give us a sense of how that could possibly happen yeah so you can do
708160	713120	this in your kitchen go right now and find some food coloring in your kitchen
713120	719000	and some water and mix it up on a clean glass slide and put these two drops next
719000	723560	to each other in a few moments you will notice that these two food coloring
723560	727720	droplets will be talking to each other what they do is they send out a water
727720	733320	signal there is a vapor cloud around it vapor cloud yes and that vapor cloud is
733320	737800	interacting and there is more vapor between the two than around the
737800	742320	surroundings and that leads to this incredible phenomena which is not so
742320	746920	far from retrograde flows in cells where cells are these engines with all these
746920	752880	motors moving around but this purely arises in a physical system and so the
752880	758440	reason I brought that example is sometimes we although biology is complex
758440	764960	the phenomena's and the basic principles could actually be very very simple in
764960	769440	components yes yes so what I'm hearing from you and this is this really does
769440	774320	make sense is that whereas we might say that because it's a living cell it has
774320	779360	a complex communication with its neighboring cell you have shown that
779360	783920	these two drops which are obviously not living cells still have communication
783920	789400	challenges and we may not need to invoke complex cellular communication to
789400	793640	explain some of the phenomenon that we see yeah and even to a point where not
793640	799160	only do they sense then based on that signal you act on it and you can move
799160	804440	and you can sense quite literally the same phenomena that white blood cells are
804440	808840	doing trying to chase bacteria during an infection an infection we replicate with
808840	812320	two drops of water this is the future of everything I'm Russ Alvin I'm speaking
812320	816600	with Dr. Manu Prakash from bioengineering at Stanford I know a little
816600	819800	bit about your work and I know that that droplet work has also led to some
819800	824160	intriguing demonstrations of doing computation with droplets can you give
824160	827400	us a sense of what the heck I mean I think of computation as silicon
827400	832840	electrons transistors but you've written papers about how droplets can be used to
832840	837480	simulate some of not simulate to perform some of the functions that we have
837520	843480	traditionally associate with silicon and transistors tell us about that yeah so
843480	847880	you know when we think of a computer we're thinking of processing information
847880	852480	and that information revolution has led us here but there is a bit that got
852480	859000	missed out which is that every bit in a computer is also physical you know every
859000	863680	electron that's running around you can make optical computers photons running
863720	870280	around and I had this notion of thinking about could we use computation to
870280	875160	actually assemble matter if that bit could be a grocery bag that I could put
875160	879640	molecules and another things in run a computation and walla instead of getting
879640	884880	a number out I would get an object out so that's been the mission for the last
884880	888600	12 years have been working on this and at this point we're at a stage where we
888600	893920	have demonstrated universal synchronous computation using these droplets that
893920	898480	interact with each other they form all kinds of logic gates they're completely
898480	903840	modular so the system is scalable but the goal is not wordpress or word
903840	909240	processing but the goal is to actually build using this material so imagine you
909240	914480	write a little two-line code that codes for the Serpentski triangle but I have
914520	919520	no idea what that is so you can think of the Pascal triangle for example or you
919520	923480	could think of a fractal yes it's a fractal like structure with a
923480	928560	hierarchical structure and if I was to place every element of that fractal one
928560	932560	at a time serially which is what 3d printing kind of tries to do it would
932560	936480	take forever forever but if you can teach it to do the computation it
936480	941440	algorithmically builds and local parts interact with each other to build a
941480	945720	local structure that interacts with the rest of it so just to help us just I
945720	949360	just want to go a little bit more for this computation with droplets so is it
949360	953760	the is the right analogy that in the same way that we have wires with electrons
953760	957400	moving on them and we get the electrons to go to the left to the right and by
957400	962920	bringing them together they can do ads or subtracts or other numerical that you
962920	967440	can get the droplets to flow through perhaps like a microfluidic channel split
967760	972360	come together and do very similar things as what electrons are doing in wire is
972360	977440	that the general yeah that's a that's a good basic way of describing this and
977440	981160	the droplets are interacting with each other just like electrons interact with
981160	985440	electromagnetic fields and charges they're interacting with hydrodynamic
985440	989880	fields and in the latest system we demonstrated there actually there are no
989880	995080	wires that it's essentially a flat surface of water that they're moving
995080	999560	around and because they're interacting with each other they provide the
999560	1004400	structure they need and we inject energy in the system in a way to control it
1004400	1011680	from outside unbelievable so we can look forward to these computational fluid
1011680	1016600	systems that are helping us get solve problems through an analogy with
1016600	1020840	electronic computer systems yeah sort of my hope is that we're able to build
1020840	1024640	some of these systems that can make materials that we've never been able to
1024680	1029280	make for example heterogeneous material you know like my hand right has
1029280	1033320	thousands of different materials multi-component we don't know we're
1033320	1037680	close to that in the context of our manufacturing capability so speaking of
1037680	1041480	manufacturing capabilities I want to move to the part that everybody loves
1041480	1046800	when they talk to you which is your focus on what we call frugal science and
1046800	1052040	the creation of devices using the rules of physics but with an extreme emphasis
1052040	1055800	on affordability and I think the one of the first ones that first of all the
1055800	1059160	computation with fluids could be that already but let's move to a something
1059160	1063320	that got a lot of press which was your creation of the fold scope can you tell
1063320	1069600	us what the fold scope is and why it exists yeah so I think we have one in
1069600	1072600	front of us that's correct we have something sitting here and you should
1072600	1077160	think of this as a pencil of microscopy you know many of many of us are
1077160	1081400	carrying pencils and pens around and it's important you know it's a point of
1081400	1086920	making about literacy that I can have my thoughts be heard and seen and share
1086920	1092240	it's a tool and very much what ends up happening in science sometimes with you
1092240	1096920	know two billion kids on this planet and one billion of them technically living
1096920	1102040	under poverty it starts realizing this idea that access to science is not a
1102040	1107120	common thing we're just the lucky ones who sort of made it through somebody you
1107160	1111960	know helped us along and we're here and billions of other kids can also be here
1111960	1115320	except at the same time they haven't had the access and they don't have the tools
1115320	1119760	and they don't have the tools there are a lot of knowledge and actually the
1119760	1123960	information revolution is really changing that Wikipedia Khan Academy many
1123960	1129200	of these miracles of knowledge there's incredible knowledge but science
1129200	1133600	composed of knowledge and experience and we're missing the experience without
1133760	1137280	the experience there is no aha moment without an aha moment I wouldn't be
1137280	1142800	sitting here so what we decided to do almost six years ago now is to make a
1142800	1149320	microscope that was gonna cost a dollar and can do resolutions that are sub
1149320	1153640	cellular and there was this challenge of let's do something where cost and
1153640	1158880	performance really try to push the limits yes and this is where comes in a
1158960	1163920	new manufacturing tools so fold scope is an origami microscope so I for those of
1163920	1168240	you can't see we are looking at what looks like a bunch of cutout paper and
1168240	1172480	colorful and it has a bunch of cutouts and this you should think of this as
1172480	1176800	art and craft essentially that it should feel so natural to you it's a piece of
1176800	1181760	paper you can drop it bang on it but then once it's folded together there's a
1181760	1186360	little place I insert a little slide of water that I just collected outside I
1186400	1192120	clip it on and at this point is now holding up to his eye this little piece
1192120	1197160	of cardboard and I have transported into a new world for a second I forgot about
1197160	1205440	your eyes because I was watching single cells of a moss which is a plant like
1205440	1210320	structure but except that little tiles of little pieces of bricks all assembled
1210320	1213680	together so let me clarify if I may hold that for a moment yeah I'm gonna
1213720	1218720	actually give this to you I've lost him he is in the microbiome hold here and
1218720	1222680	here on the two sides and just bring it close to your eye pointing to the light
1222680	1226600	so let me just first describe that this is fundamentally made out of a kind of
1226600	1231480	card subcard board grade paper like a what you might get a greeting card on it's
1231480	1236240	an elaborate folded piece with there but in the middle there is something that's
1236240	1240040	not paper and I want you to because I don't this is not magic there's still I
1240080	1244960	guess a lens so could you tell us about the lens set up what it's made out of and
1244960	1249000	I is that an expensive component or is that not expensive no so I think one of
1249000	1253160	the questions we really asked ourselves is given constraints in physics and this
1253160	1257160	is why I call it frugal science because there's a lot of rigor that went into
1257160	1264000	manufacturing this lens I am seeing things in this lens and one of the threads
1264000	1268160	that you start thinking about is given two optical surfaces what is the
1268800	1273320	theoretical resolution best possible resolution you can achieve so you had to
1273320	1277880	use pretty deep optical theory so we solve that analytical equation that took
1277880	1282640	33 pages to solve but then once you have it we have a design tool that suddenly
1282640	1286720	and so rather than asking that I will keep piling up pieces of glass after
1286720	1291480	glass we asked a question given minimal number of surfaces what is the best thing
1291480	1296280	you can do and then we built robots this would not be possible because at this
1296320	1301000	point in the lab itself we shipped around 80,000 of these instruments around
1301000	1306680	the world how much do they cost so at so we as a disclosure we spun off last year
1306680	1309920	as a startup company that I'm a co-founder of and at this point for a
1309920	1315160	$1.50 you can buy a full scope and is that is that an actual piece of glass
1315160	1320920	that's correct the last lenses it has magnetic couplers it couples to your
1320920	1324920	phone so you can share the data with friends now for people who have used a
1324920	1329240	microscope and they know that there's like 10x 40x 100x what is this this
1329240	1334200	would be equivalent to 140x objective okay and the thing that you start
1334200	1339600	thinking about is the data that we collect is I can watch individual bacteria
1339600	1343240	so if we had more time I would have asked you to give me a little spit sample
1343240	1347480	and then we would have watched single bacteria swimming around and you know and
1347480	1351200	then and the magnification is sufficient sufficient enough to actually watch
1351520	1355640	bacteria was this motivated by a real health need or is this mostly for the
1355640	1360200	education of the youth no I think it's both and it was this realization that
1360200	1365600	you cannot provide health surfaces around the world if you don't provide
1365600	1370040	health education if you don't provide I mean I've been out in the field many
1370040	1373680	times with the fancy hospital in the middle of nowhere but the patients
1373680	1378080	don't even believe in medicine they have never experienced the germ theory for
1378080	1382600	that matter you know so seeing a germ might be a transformational experience
1382600	1386160	for them so there is a social context to this which is really we should open up
1386160	1390480	science so people get a chance to really understand the beginnings and at that
1390480	1395680	same time the same sets of tools that are Peruvian doctors who have used this
1395680	1399880	for cervical cancer we have demonstrated diagnostics applications for these not
1399880	1405520	just for humans but for plants and animals there is a sailor right now in
1405760	1411120	the middle of the Pacific Ocean fold scoping on his you know 15-foot boat
1411120	1414920	unbelievable now can you give me an example of what kind of diagnosis might
1414920	1419360	a fold scope be capable of making yeah so any stool samples for example if you
1419360	1423600	really start thinking about from the very beginning of where we started this
1423600	1429160	the question of helmet infections eggs and stool you can start with urine
1429160	1433000	absolutely and I think one of the threads is we've demonstrated we can
1433040	1438640	even image malaria parasites we can image many blood-borne pathogens one of
1438640	1441720	the things that we have and I want to stress when he says image when you say
1441720	1445560	image you're talking about with this one dollar and 50 cent cardboard plus a
1445560	1449280	piece of glass and a piece of metal yeah and one of the things that's valuable
1449280	1453200	about diagnostics when we started doing this is we realize diagnostics is about
1453200	1457680	searching for a needle in a haystack and sometimes if the needle is right in
1457680	1461920	front of your lens you could to see it but sometimes it's not so we invented a
1461960	1466240	way to around that to find the needle this is the future of everything I'm
1466240	1470600	Russ Altman and I'm speaking with Manu Prakash about how physics can turn into
1470600	1475240	extreme frugal instrumentation so you were just about to talk about a new
1475240	1480120	device I believe it's called the paper huge what's the paper fuge all about
1480120	1484720	yeah so it sort of stems from this idea that if you're searching for a needle in
1484720	1488320	a haystack if you could just pick out the needle then you won't be searching
1488520	1493000	anymore and that process in the scientific context is called centrifugation so
1493000	1497160	that's usually I think of a big machine that spins very fast and it separates
1497160	1501120	the thicker things go to the bottom the thinner things stay at the top and we
1501120	1506560	are able to separate yes and so by density and it turns out parasites have
1506560	1511080	different density than our native cells so if there is one blood cell that has
1511080	1516440	a malaria parasite the density has changed now and we'll be able to pull that
1516440	1520440	out by separating by separating it but now the question is if I'm in the
1520440	1525560	middle of nowhere under a tree with no electricity no power no nothing that big
1525560	1529000	centrifuge that I described is not an option that's correct it's not an option
1529000	1532920	I'm looking at Manu and he's holding an odd-looking thing which I'm sure he's
1532920	1537800	about to talk about when I shut up but it looks like two cylindrical cardboard
1537800	1541160	pieces with string and then something in the middle what are we looking at Manu
1541560	1547760	you are looking at one of the oldest toy in the history of mankind this is a
1547760	1553000	5,000 year old toy which in many cultures is called button on a string and we
1553000	1558080	made this realization that if we study all possible toys that spin could we
1558080	1563920	mathematically write down equations to beat the world record for fastest
1563920	1568080	spinning object in human with human power human engineered oh and human
1568320	1574160	powered so we have this object that I'm now spinning it is spinning very fast
1574160	1578560	he's doing kind of a back-and-forth motion with the string and the central
1578560	1583920	disc is spinning I have no idea I'm sure Manu will tell us very fast yeah so
1583920	1590080	this specific one right now itself was spinning around 20,000 rpm 20,000
1590080	1594440	rotations per minute and then there are many versions of this we make and our
1594520	1599960	fastest spinning one is actually 125,000 rpm now does that actually set the
1599960	1603640	record you were seeking that is correct that sets the world record at this point
1603640	1607640	for the fastest spinning object and I think the reason I'm stressing this is I
1607640	1612040	really do want people to break that record right if we were a challenge it is a
1612040	1618280	challenge and of course it took us again going back to the rigor 20 bits of
1618280	1621960	equations to really describe the parameters because although people had
1622840	1626280	played with this toy nobody had asked this question how this toy actually works
1627000	1631880	and so you know the joy going back to the beauty in science is the joy for us was
1631880	1635560	really figuring that out and of course there is a phenomenal outcome of that
1635560	1639560	but I would have been happy just figuring out the toy as well so we set the record
1639560	1643960	for rotations but I guess it begs the question are we able to use this device to
1643960	1648280	do the kinds of separations you described to actually make some kind of useful
1648280	1652440	diagnoses find that heavy malarial cell if you will yeah so I think they're in
1652440	1656840	here if some of you can see there's a little glass slide a glass capillary that
1656840	1661320	I had put and if we had more point time and I had my lancet I would have done a
1661320	1666200	little finger prick take the capillary fill the blood within 90 seconds of
1666200	1670760	going back and forth going back and forth we have separated all of blood plasma
1670760	1675720	from the blood cells itself and pure plasma is extremely useful and important
1675720	1680040	for rdt tests all these rapid diagnostics yes because all the enzymes have to get
1680040	1684040	rid of the red blood cells and you want kind of the clear fluid that you get this
1684040	1688200	fantastic sensitivity and specificity using that and then of course if we just
1688200	1692920	spend for a little bit longer for around between seven to ten minutes you
1692920	1697160	actually separate out every single malaria parasite malaria is a tough one
1697160	1701080	because it's a really tiny parasite but that in itself this thing is spinning
1701080	1708200	around 30 000 g forces 30 000 g that's correct so you are experiencing if you
1708200	1711880	were that little cell you're experiencing a very high force well this is just
1711880	1717560	fantastic because we've gone from a very for the lack of a better phrase high
1717560	1723000	falutin conception of what physics can bring to biology to a series of
1723000	1727640	inventions that are bringing science and the ability to make uh experiential
1727640	1731400	observations really globally to everyone in the world who has any interest in
1731400	1734120	doing that thank you for listening to the future of
