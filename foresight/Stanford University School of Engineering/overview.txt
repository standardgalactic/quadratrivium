1. **Centrifugation**: Centrifugation is a process used in laboratories to separate components of a mixture based on their density by using centrifugal force. It's commonly used to separate blood cells from plasma, especially for diagnosing malaria as it separates the parasite-infected cells from the rest.

2. **Manual Centrifuge Alternative**: In the absence of electrical power or sophisticated centrifuges, a simple and ancient toy called "button on a string" (also known as a whirligig or spindizzy) can be used to create centrifugal force by human power. It consists of two cylindrical cardboard pieces with a central disc attached by string, which is spun manually.

3. **World Record**: Researchers used this manual centrifuge to set the world record for the fastest spinning object powered by human engineering at 125,000 rpm.

4. **Diagnostic Use**: The same manual centrifuge can be used to separate blood cells from plasma, which is useful for rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and identifying malaria parasites. The device can generate up to 30,000 g-forces, which is sufficient to perform this separation efficiently.

5. **Accessibility and Impact**: This innovation demonstrates how basic scientific principles can be applied creatively to address global challenges, making advanced diagnostics accessible even in resource-limited settings. It emphasizes the importance of understanding fundamental physics and its applications in biology.
