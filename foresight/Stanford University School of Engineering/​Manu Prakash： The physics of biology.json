{"text": " from the campus of stanford university people are worried about data they're worried about their privacy and their security they should be we need secure systems this is the future of everything but we can't have a system that closes that data off it is too rich of a source of inspiration innovation and discovery for new things in medicine today on the future of everything the future of using physics to understand biology and to build new devices now when we think of physics we often think of the study of fundamental forces in the world gravity the theory of relativity electricity the big bang black holes dark matter we may think about the big experimental facilities around the world big telescopes particle beams and linear accelerators the detection of cosmic events black holes we may not think however about biology biological systems of course of course must obey the rules of physics but somehow those rules seem distant and not directly applicable in biological systems we may not always think of a physicist studying fundamental forces relevant to biology life on earth and creating devices for measuring these phenomenon but of course physicists do do this indeed life on earth has had to evolve in response I'm saying obvious things here to the physical world to solve some remarkable problems how do we encode the shapes of living organisms so that with just their DNA with just their genome they can reproducibly form their expected shape how can living organisms work with water water is a fascinating substance it has special properties in terms of its chemical makeup its electrical activity how it interacts with itself and its ability to host other molecules that are dissolved within it how can we build physical systems in living systems that perceive signals how do we perceive visual signals audio signals touch taste these must all be sensed at a molecular physical level and then integrated into useful signals that the organism can then integrate to figure out the key things like where's the light where's the food pretty much that's actually that's pretty much everything where's the light where's the food where's the mate so these are the basic functions of living systems now a fascinating branch of biology is the study of how biological systems take advantage of physics to accomplish complex tasks tasks that appear to be difficult or even impossible so what am I talking about well this includes the study of self-assembly where individual units of a biological system can create a complex structure without any explicit instructions let me give an example there are viruses spherical viruses that are particles made up of 180 identical subunits that form these beautiful perfect spheres that contain these beautiful perfect spheres that contain the DNA that makes the virus infectious just based on how these individual proteins they are interact with one another they can spontaneously form these shells there's no need to build a scaffold there's no need to say okay now you go there you go there they just kind of because of their intrinsic physical features they assemble with one another and they form these spheres similarly the outer membrane of a cell which is lipids that create a boundary between the inside and the outside of the cell are made of lipid molecules that self-assemble to form these compartments that support the living machinery imagine having a bunch of fabric and saying could you please make me a tent and whoosh the fabric spontaneously forms a tent in the case of the virus imagine just having pieces Lego pieces lying around which will spontaneously form a sphere without any effort this is what happens in many times in biology or how DNA of course forms these beautiful double helices that look a lot like helical staircases imagine wanting a helical staircase in your mansion not a problem that I have where you just get all the materials and they self-assemble into a beautiful double helix without any instruction we do not understand all the ways in which by lock biological systems have harnessed physics to solve these problems but we have examples where where it has this is worth understanding big both because of natural curiosity of how biological systems work and because it may elucidate principles that allow us to take advantage of these same are the of these rules to build devices and new capabilities in in our world that can advance our technology and our understanding my guest today is professor Manu Prakash from the department of bioengineering at Stanford University and Manu is an expert physicist working on biological systems he studies the physics of biological systems at the molecular cellular and tissue level and he also takes the insights that he learns from this deep dive into the physics of biological systems to build cool devices we'll get to the devices but Manu as someone who trained as a physicist applied physics what drew you to biological systems and what do you tell your fellow physicists about what's exciting or challenging about biology you know it's once in a life you get this moment where you take a backseat and you think you know what do you want your life to be and that happens a couple of times in our lives and that happened to me right after grad school and anybody who's peered through a microscope would know that there is a piece of matter that we do not understand that we cannot write down a bunch of equations to explain and it's so us you know biology so us so I mean you know I was studying many different things in the past but that that emotional connection you have with aha you know not only am I trying to understand this piece of matter but my act of understanding it is that piece of matter very meta yeah that was that's the philosophical times that you go in and then you ask this is what I want to do for my life and I think I find it's a little bit strange sometimes I mean you're right I have to explain some times to my physics friends that hey this is the most exciting thing in the world and sometimes I think that sense of wonder if you just share that sense of wonder first yes I mean the aesthetic and beauty in biology is incredible and if you're not working on a beautiful problem then you know find a new problem now I want to give you credit though because I know many physicists who take a little they dip their toes into biology they love mathematical equations that explain the world if you've taken any physics you know f equals ma it's very famous force equals mass times acceleration based on that very simple equation you can derive how we got men to the moon how we build devices that work and that don't break and and sometimes my physics friends that you know biology is too squishy there's no right angles there's no real underlying mathematical formalism and I'm out I'm sorry yeah this did not happen to you yeah or did it not yet not yet I think I'm naive and I am perfectly happy being naive sometimes and I mean I actually tell most of my students you have to be naive sometimes to have the guts that we will try to understand this piece of matter and I think I mean to your point about the complexity it's it is what makes biology so much more fun that although there are these rules there is every time an exception to that rule yes and I find that fascinating so so you have worked on this self-assembly issue I talked about the viruses and some other things tell us what what is the state of our understanding of self assembling systems and are we just at at a baby point or are we beginning to really understand the what's going on when these systems do these amazing activities of creating complex objects from simple subunits yeah so I mean I would argue we're really at the beginning and the reason for that is most of our insights initially in that field have come from just watching biology the fact that now we have the capability of really ripping apart a virus particle and really see the sets of components gives us the sense that we are starting to understand the list of components but how they come together and build things that are not one even two or three orders of magnitude larger than the component like your example of truly bringing a grant grand staircase from a point of view of a molecule a cell is a gigantic staircase we don't really understand where these lens scales are set up you know where is that encoded shape and form at higher levels hierarchy has been really fantastic so I think we we don't exploit that too much in and I think the other aspect of the field has really grown when we had tried to take small components and then ask ourselves we are going to build something out of it so for example the entire world of DNA all algorithmic assembly or even general ideas where you take and now make components that are literally dead but still demonstrate the principles that's where the most exciting bits that I see because I start to see an inkling of things that we would never been able to manufacture before this is the future everything of everything I'm Russ Altman I'm speaking with Professor Manu Prakash about physics and its influences these days on biology what is your favorite current system to look at to understand self-assembly I'm trying to get this down to a real system that you find fascinating that you think you might be able to understand yeah so this is kind of it's slightly ironic but sometimes what ends up happening is the biology inspires an insight and then you can take that insight and even work on that system in an abiotic manner non-biological non-biological and so there is a system in the lab that we've been trying to build now for several years to really demonstrate that we can do algorithmic self-assembly using droplets droplets yeah there is a two years ago we demonstrated a type of an active droplet system that demonstrates are you talking about fluid droplets that's correct fluid droplets but they can actually be phase droplets they can be protein droplets very fluid like phases that demonstrate very phenomena that you would not be able to distinguish from chemotaxis for example they can sense each other they can crawl they can chase each other but they're not living they're just physical literally small bits molecules of fluid and they're communicating with each other now that sounds like magic you got you have to tell us I have to stop you then you have to give us a sense of how that could possibly happen yeah so you can do this in your kitchen go right now and find some food coloring in your kitchen and some water and mix it up on a clean glass slide and put these two drops next to each other in a few moments you will notice that these two food coloring droplets will be talking to each other what they do is they send out a water signal there is a vapor cloud around it vapor cloud yes and that vapor cloud is interacting and there is more vapor between the two than around the surroundings and that leads to this incredible phenomena which is not so far from retrograde flows in cells where cells are these engines with all these motors moving around but this purely arises in a physical system and so the reason I brought that example is sometimes we although biology is complex the phenomena's and the basic principles could actually be very very simple in components yes yes so what I'm hearing from you and this is this really does make sense is that whereas we might say that because it's a living cell it has a complex communication with its neighboring cell you have shown that these two drops which are obviously not living cells still have communication challenges and we may not need to invoke complex cellular communication to explain some of the phenomenon that we see yeah and even to a point where not only do they sense then based on that signal you act on it and you can move and you can sense quite literally the same phenomena that white blood cells are doing trying to chase bacteria during an infection an infection we replicate with two drops of water this is the future of everything I'm Russ Alvin I'm speaking with Dr. Manu Prakash from bioengineering at Stanford I know a little bit about your work and I know that that droplet work has also led to some intriguing demonstrations of doing computation with droplets can you give us a sense of what the heck I mean I think of computation as silicon electrons transistors but you've written papers about how droplets can be used to simulate some of not simulate to perform some of the functions that we have traditionally associate with silicon and transistors tell us about that yeah so you know when we think of a computer we're thinking of processing information and that information revolution has led us here but there is a bit that got missed out which is that every bit in a computer is also physical you know every electron that's running around you can make optical computers photons running around and I had this notion of thinking about could we use computation to actually assemble matter if that bit could be a grocery bag that I could put molecules and another things in run a computation and walla instead of getting a number out I would get an object out so that's been the mission for the last 12 years have been working on this and at this point we're at a stage where we have demonstrated universal synchronous computation using these droplets that interact with each other they form all kinds of logic gates they're completely modular so the system is scalable but the goal is not wordpress or word processing but the goal is to actually build using this material so imagine you write a little two-line code that codes for the Serpentski triangle but I have no idea what that is so you can think of the Pascal triangle for example or you could think of a fractal yes it's a fractal like structure with a hierarchical structure and if I was to place every element of that fractal one at a time serially which is what 3d printing kind of tries to do it would take forever forever but if you can teach it to do the computation it algorithmically builds and local parts interact with each other to build a local structure that interacts with the rest of it so just to help us just I just want to go a little bit more for this computation with droplets so is it the is the right analogy that in the same way that we have wires with electrons moving on them and we get the electrons to go to the left to the right and by bringing them together they can do ads or subtracts or other numerical that you can get the droplets to flow through perhaps like a microfluidic channel split come together and do very similar things as what electrons are doing in wire is that the general yeah that's a that's a good basic way of describing this and the droplets are interacting with each other just like electrons interact with electromagnetic fields and charges they're interacting with hydrodynamic fields and in the latest system we demonstrated there actually there are no wires that it's essentially a flat surface of water that they're moving around and because they're interacting with each other they provide the structure they need and we inject energy in the system in a way to control it from outside unbelievable so we can look forward to these computational fluid systems that are helping us get solve problems through an analogy with electronic computer systems yeah sort of my hope is that we're able to build some of these systems that can make materials that we've never been able to make for example heterogeneous material you know like my hand right has thousands of different materials multi-component we don't know we're close to that in the context of our manufacturing capability so speaking of manufacturing capabilities I want to move to the part that everybody loves when they talk to you which is your focus on what we call frugal science and the creation of devices using the rules of physics but with an extreme emphasis on affordability and I think the one of the first ones that first of all the computation with fluids could be that already but let's move to a something that got a lot of press which was your creation of the fold scope can you tell us what the fold scope is and why it exists yeah so I think we have one in front of us that's correct we have something sitting here and you should think of this as a pencil of microscopy you know many of many of us are carrying pencils and pens around and it's important you know it's a point of making about literacy that I can have my thoughts be heard and seen and share it's a tool and very much what ends up happening in science sometimes with you know two billion kids on this planet and one billion of them technically living under poverty it starts realizing this idea that access to science is not a common thing we're just the lucky ones who sort of made it through somebody you know helped us along and we're here and billions of other kids can also be here except at the same time they haven't had the access and they don't have the tools and they don't have the tools there are a lot of knowledge and actually the information revolution is really changing that Wikipedia Khan Academy many of these miracles of knowledge there's incredible knowledge but science composed of knowledge and experience and we're missing the experience without the experience there is no aha moment without an aha moment I wouldn't be sitting here so what we decided to do almost six years ago now is to make a microscope that was gonna cost a dollar and can do resolutions that are sub cellular and there was this challenge of let's do something where cost and performance really try to push the limits yes and this is where comes in a new manufacturing tools so fold scope is an origami microscope so I for those of you can't see we are looking at what looks like a bunch of cutout paper and colorful and it has a bunch of cutouts and this you should think of this as art and craft essentially that it should feel so natural to you it's a piece of paper you can drop it bang on it but then once it's folded together there's a little place I insert a little slide of water that I just collected outside I clip it on and at this point is now holding up to his eye this little piece of cardboard and I have transported into a new world for a second I forgot about your eyes because I was watching single cells of a moss which is a plant like structure but except that little tiles of little pieces of bricks all assembled together so let me clarify if I may hold that for a moment yeah I'm gonna actually give this to you I've lost him he is in the microbiome hold here and here on the two sides and just bring it close to your eye pointing to the light so let me just first describe that this is fundamentally made out of a kind of card subcard board grade paper like a what you might get a greeting card on it's an elaborate folded piece with there but in the middle there is something that's not paper and I want you to because I don't this is not magic there's still I guess a lens so could you tell us about the lens set up what it's made out of and I is that an expensive component or is that not expensive no so I think one of the questions we really asked ourselves is given constraints in physics and this is why I call it frugal science because there's a lot of rigor that went into manufacturing this lens I am seeing things in this lens and one of the threads that you start thinking about is given two optical surfaces what is the theoretical resolution best possible resolution you can achieve so you had to use pretty deep optical theory so we solve that analytical equation that took 33 pages to solve but then once you have it we have a design tool that suddenly and so rather than asking that I will keep piling up pieces of glass after glass we asked a question given minimal number of surfaces what is the best thing you can do and then we built robots this would not be possible because at this point in the lab itself we shipped around 80,000 of these instruments around the world how much do they cost so at so we as a disclosure we spun off last year as a startup company that I'm a co-founder of and at this point for a $1.50 you can buy a full scope and is that is that an actual piece of glass that's correct the last lenses it has magnetic couplers it couples to your phone so you can share the data with friends now for people who have used a microscope and they know that there's like 10x 40x 100x what is this this would be equivalent to 140x objective okay and the thing that you start thinking about is the data that we collect is I can watch individual bacteria so if we had more time I would have asked you to give me a little spit sample and then we would have watched single bacteria swimming around and you know and then and the magnification is sufficient sufficient enough to actually watch bacteria was this motivated by a real health need or is this mostly for the education of the youth no I think it's both and it was this realization that you cannot provide health surfaces around the world if you don't provide health education if you don't provide I mean I've been out in the field many times with the fancy hospital in the middle of nowhere but the patients don't even believe in medicine they have never experienced the germ theory for that matter you know so seeing a germ might be a transformational experience for them so there is a social context to this which is really we should open up science so people get a chance to really understand the beginnings and at that same time the same sets of tools that are Peruvian doctors who have used this for cervical cancer we have demonstrated diagnostics applications for these not just for humans but for plants and animals there is a sailor right now in the middle of the Pacific Ocean fold scoping on his you know 15-foot boat unbelievable now can you give me an example of what kind of diagnosis might a fold scope be capable of making yeah so any stool samples for example if you really start thinking about from the very beginning of where we started this the question of helmet infections eggs and stool you can start with urine absolutely and I think one of the threads is we've demonstrated we can even image malaria parasites we can image many blood-borne pathogens one of the things that we have and I want to stress when he says image when you say image you're talking about with this one dollar and 50 cent cardboard plus a piece of glass and a piece of metal yeah and one of the things that's valuable about diagnostics when we started doing this is we realize diagnostics is about searching for a needle in a haystack and sometimes if the needle is right in front of your lens you could to see it but sometimes it's not so we invented a way to around that to find the needle this is the future of everything I'm Russ Altman and I'm speaking with Manu Prakash about how physics can turn into extreme frugal instrumentation so you were just about to talk about a new device I believe it's called the paper huge what's the paper fuge all about yeah so it sort of stems from this idea that if you're searching for a needle in a haystack if you could just pick out the needle then you won't be searching anymore and that process in the scientific context is called centrifugation so that's usually I think of a big machine that spins very fast and it separates the thicker things go to the bottom the thinner things stay at the top and we are able to separate yes and so by density and it turns out parasites have different density than our native cells so if there is one blood cell that has a malaria parasite the density has changed now and we'll be able to pull that out by separating by separating it but now the question is if I'm in the middle of nowhere under a tree with no electricity no power no nothing that big centrifuge that I described is not an option that's correct it's not an option I'm looking at Manu and he's holding an odd-looking thing which I'm sure he's about to talk about when I shut up but it looks like two cylindrical cardboard pieces with string and then something in the middle what are we looking at Manu you are looking at one of the oldest toy in the history of mankind this is a 5,000 year old toy which in many cultures is called button on a string and we made this realization that if we study all possible toys that spin could we mathematically write down equations to beat the world record for fastest spinning object in human with human power human engineered oh and human powered so we have this object that I'm now spinning it is spinning very fast he's doing kind of a back-and-forth motion with the string and the central disc is spinning I have no idea I'm sure Manu will tell us very fast yeah so this specific one right now itself was spinning around 20,000 rpm 20,000 rotations per minute and then there are many versions of this we make and our fastest spinning one is actually 125,000 rpm now does that actually set the record you were seeking that is correct that sets the world record at this point for the fastest spinning object and I think the reason I'm stressing this is I really do want people to break that record right if we were a challenge it is a challenge and of course it took us again going back to the rigor 20 bits of equations to really describe the parameters because although people had played with this toy nobody had asked this question how this toy actually works and so you know the joy going back to the beauty in science is the joy for us was really figuring that out and of course there is a phenomenal outcome of that but I would have been happy just figuring out the toy as well so we set the record for rotations but I guess it begs the question are we able to use this device to do the kinds of separations you described to actually make some kind of useful diagnoses find that heavy malarial cell if you will yeah so I think they're in here if some of you can see there's a little glass slide a glass capillary that I had put and if we had more point time and I had my lancet I would have done a little finger prick take the capillary fill the blood within 90 seconds of going back and forth going back and forth we have separated all of blood plasma from the blood cells itself and pure plasma is extremely useful and important for rdt tests all these rapid diagnostics yes because all the enzymes have to get rid of the red blood cells and you want kind of the clear fluid that you get this fantastic sensitivity and specificity using that and then of course if we just spend for a little bit longer for around between seven to ten minutes you actually separate out every single malaria parasite malaria is a tough one because it's a really tiny parasite but that in itself this thing is spinning around 30 000 g forces 30 000 g that's correct so you are experiencing if you were that little cell you're experiencing a very high force well this is just fantastic because we've gone from a very for the lack of a better phrase highfalutin conception of what physics can bring to biology to a series of inventions that are bringing science and the ability to make uh experiential observations really globally to everyone in the world who has any interest in doing that thank you for listening to the future of everything i'm ross altman if
