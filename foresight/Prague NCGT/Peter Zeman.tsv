0	7720	All right. Welcome to this week's Non-Pictive Geometry and Topology Seminar. It's our pleasure
7720	12760	today to have Petr Zeeman from the Technical University of Denmark, who will tell us about
12760	16280	quantum automorphism groups of graphs.
16280	25080	Thank you for inviting me. So in this talk, I will talk about, as you said, quantum automorphism
25080	38480	groups of graphs, and this work is based on those two quite recent papers with those
38480	41280	people that are listed here.
41280	50720	And so I'm currently a postdoc with David Robertson, and the project we are working
50720	56960	on is in the intersection of graph theory and quantum information theory.
56960	64240	So somehow, graph theory is used to study some concepts in quantum information theory.
64240	68720	In particular, the area of graph theory is graphomorphisms, which I will talk about a
68720	82320	little bit. And at some point in some works, quantum groups of graphs occur, and these
82320	95480	two works are sort of like a bridge between those two areas in some sense, since probably
95480	105280	from the quantum group side, there are two groups of people that work on quantum groups
105280	111760	and that work on graph theory, and those groups usually don't know much about the things
111760	113960	that the other ones work on.
113960	119400	And basically, what I would like to a lot focus on in this talk is to show you some
119400	128800	techniques from combinatorics that we used to obtain some, like in combinatorics, the
128800	134240	combinatorial analog would be some simple results about automorphism groups of graphs,
134240	141320	but for some reason, these results did not at all exist in the relatively recent but
141320	145920	not that recent field of quantum automorphism groups of graphs.
145920	153840	So let's start with just the notion of the graph isomorphism. So two graphs are isomorphic.
153840	159600	Basically, if we can find a permutation or a bijective mapping between the vertices of
159600	166640	one graph to the other graph, such that this mapping preserves adjacencies and non-agencies.
166640	173880	So in other words, the graphs are exactly the same up to some relabeling of the vertices.
173880	181560	We denote it like this. And so alternatively, this alternative two points of view will play
181560	189240	a role here. So alternatively, one could view it if you take the adjacency matrices of the
189240	195400	corresponding graphs and you would have a permutation matrix that has to commute with
195400	202040	those adjacency matrices. So that's an equivalent definition of isomorphism of graphs.
202040	210440	And another very impressive theorem was given by Lova's in a previous century in 1967, which
210440	217040	basically characterizes this relation of being isomorphic by the following counting of homomorphism.
217040	224920	So homomorphism of between two graphs is like isomorphism, but you relax the condition a
224920	231800	little bit. It's a mapping that only has to preserve adjacencies. So for example, you
231800	241880	can have a homomorphism from a bipartite graph to an edge. So and this notation means that we
241880	251000	count the number of possible homomorphisms from some graph F to the graph G. So the isomorphism
251000	256280	relation between two graphs is characterized by homomorphism counting. So the homomorphism counts
256280	261160	the number of homomorphism from each possible graphs to those two graphs. If it's the same,
261160	269560	then the graphs are isomorphic and also the other way. Now it's not necessary to just restrict
269560	278440	ourselves to all graphs. We can use various families of graphs. So there is a similar
278440	285960	notion of homomorphism indistinguishability, where we take some family of graphs and do these
285960	294200	homomorphism counts within that family of graphs. And then we get a notion of homomorphism
295160	299720	indistinguishability, which depends on that particular cross of graphs. So here we have
299720	307640	a table of some results. And this is the Lovaas theorem, where we take the family of graphs
307640	313240	to be all graphs. And when you take various other, let's say, natural families of graphs,
313240	318840	you get other similarity relation between those classes of graphs, like for cycles. If you just
319400	324760	take cycles, then this corresponds to the cospectrality of adjacency matrices, which means
324760	329800	that the multisets of eigenvalues of the adjacency matrices of graphs is the same.
330520	337560	Cycles and paths would be cospectral components. Trees, this is actually fractional isomorphism.
338200	347240	So fractional isomorphism, you get by relaxing this equation here. So instead of a permutation
347240	354440	matrix, you would use something called doubly stochastic matrix, which is basically that the
354440	364920	rows have to sum to one. And then there is a class of bounded trivids, trivided most k.
365720	373880	And this corresponds to indistinguishability by something called k-dimensional Weisfer-Lehmann
373880	382280	algorithm, which I will talk about later. But it's just some procedure on graphs, but I will
382280	387720	talk about it. But trivid k is some parameter of graphs, which tells you how much the graph is
387720	393800	close to a tree. And then tree depth is something similar. So for various classes, we have notions,
393800	400360	and then this is the important one here, that if you take planar graphs, this is a quite recent
400360	410120	result that actually corresponds to a notion of quantum isomorphism. So homomorphism indistinguishability,
412040	417880	homomorphism indistinguishability when you restrict yourself to planar graphs. So in other words,
417880	423880	what we will see being quantum isomorphic, the result is that it's like having the same
423880	433320	homomorphism counts from planar graphs. So, okay, so just a little bit about what is this
434760	438200	quantum isomorphism. So this
438920	445000	that this small home, this is just numbers, numbers, yeah, yeah.
449160	455720	Number of homomorphism, yes. So this notion of quantum isomorphism comes from the notion of
455720	462840	a non-local game, which is an important concept in quantum information theory. I will just briefly
462840	470040	introduce it. So in the game, you have two players, Alice and Bob, and a verifier. And
470040	476120	both of the players have some finite input sets, X, A, X, B corresponding to those players,
476120	481160	and some finite output sets, Y, A, Y, B. And then you have a Boolean predicate, which is basically
481160	490280	a function, zero one function from this Cartesian product. And so basically the players are asked
490280	498200	a question from the input, and they have to answer, and the players win if this is evaluated to one.
499240	504760	They cannot communicate after receiving questions, but they can decide on a strategy,
504760	511400	what they will do. And there is only one round of the game, and one is concerned with perfect
511400	518120	strategies in which players win the probability one. And now what kind of strategies can you have?
518280	527720	You can have deterministic strategies, where you have just some functions, which deterministically
527720	534440	say what will be the answers for Alice and Bob. Then you can have randomized strategies, which
536680	541400	are not that much better, but where you can use some randomness potentially. And then you can
541480	548840	have quantum strategies, where this Alice and Bob will share some entangled quantum state and
548840	559560	use it to get answers. So let's immediately look at this GH isomorphism game. So we have two graphs,
559560	565960	G and H. And the intuition is that Alice and Bob want to convince the referee that the graphs
566760	576360	are isomorphic. So here is the setup basically similar that the Alice and Bob are asked some
576360	583560	questions. Well, now the questions are the input sets are the vertices of the graph,
583560	590120	also the output set. And what must be satisfied is that the relation between H and H prime is the
590120	598680	same as a relation between G and G prime. So relation in the sense adjacency, not adjacency.
598680	603000	So again, the players cannot communicate, there is only one round, and they must win with the
603000	609640	probability one. And the theorem is that basically these classical players can win classical in the
609640	615640	sense that they have like a deterministic strategy, if and only if the graphs are isomorphic. And now
615640	624600	to define the quantum isomorphism is to basically turn this definition around and say that the graphs
624600	633320	are quantum isomorphic if quantum players can win this game. So that's basically a definition that
633320	639320	the graphs are quantum isomorphic if quantum players can win this GH isomorphism game.
640040	646680	What does it mean just briefly is that here we have a shared entangled state between those
646680	654760	players. And basically, so Alice and Bob share this quantum system in some states psi,
654760	662120	which is basically a unit vector in some Hilbert space. And upon receiving this vertex G, Alice
662120	669240	performs some measurement e g and this e g is basically some set of operators satisfying
669240	675320	these conditions, which is based on the quantum formalism. And the same same is done by Bob,
676040	683240	that he he does the same, these operators can commute. And there is some probability
684040	692920	probability that the players respond H H prime, given G G prime.
696680	705560	So one can reformulate this in using the notion of quantum permutation matrix. So here we have this
706520	715880	that a matrix whose entries are p i j. And these are elements of some sister algebra is a quantum
716520	724520	permutation matrix also called magic unitary. If we have this that each p i j is a projection,
724520	733640	so it must satisfy these relations. And these these matrices in the sort of in the row and
733640	743640	column must sum up to one. And the theorem by Lupini-Manchi-Sky-Robertson is that this
744840	753160	graph quantum graph isomorphism is equivalent with commuting with a quantum permutation
754040	761320	permutation matrix. So so it's it's can be expressed in a similar framework as the other
761320	766520	similarity notions like isomorphism is just commuting or fractional isomorphism with
766520	773160	with doubly stochastic matrix. And here we have commuting with this quantum permutation matrix.
774200	781560	So formally formally this this is just written out what does it mean formally that these things
781560	790040	commute. Yes, and it's important to say that quantum isomorphism is actually undecidable problem
791000	796920	compared to the graph isomorphism problem which is clearly decidable where you just can
797640	808360	can try all bijections between two graphs. And there I'm not stating not showing it here but
808360	815880	there is an example of graphs that are not isomorphic but are quantum isomorphic.
820200	825800	Right now I want to get to the somehow into the quantum isomorphism groups of graphs
827000	831880	and let's just recall that the isomorphism groups of graphs basically express the symmetries of
831880	840520	graphs and so so basically an isomorphism is just an isomorphism from a graph to itself.
841240	847960	So it's a bijective mapping with which again preserves adjacencies and similarly
848040	858200	automorphisms form a group under composition and it can be equivalently expressed using such equation
858200	864200	that the adjacency matrix has to commute with a permutation matrix.
866280	874920	Yeah so this in particular graph has a dihedral group d5 as an automorphism group we can do just
874920	885560	reflections and rotations here. Okay so you probably know much more about these things but
885560	892680	I'm just mentioning here that we have the notion of compact groups there is a correspondence between
892680	900040	compact groups and commutative sister algebras then when we take the sister algebras to be
900040	909560	non commutative then from there we go to compact quantum groups. So we now immediately
910520	918680	say what is a quantum automorphism group of a graph. So this is definition according to
918680	926680	Banica and basically so we say what is this sister algebra in this case so the
929080	934760	c of qg that's how we'll denote the quantum automorphism group of graph is the universal
934760	941320	sister algebra generated by the elements pij and satisfying basically these following
941320	948680	relations which we had similar relations before and these first two relations correspond
948680	957160	to the fact that sort of the p made up of this entries pij is a quantum permutation matrix
957800	965240	and this last one corresponds sort of to this commuting equation.
965400	978200	So if we require those pij to commute then then we get that the c of algae the algebra of functions
978200	985640	on the automorphism group of graph and the pij would be a function taking an automorphism
985640	993160	to the ij entry of the matrix representation and this matrix p is then called a fundamental
993160	1006520	representation of qg. Now let's connect it to quantum isomorphisms and so let p be the fundamental
1006520	1016120	representation of qg and we can define the following relation that ij corresponding to some
1016120	1025480	vertices let's say of the graph i is in relation with j if pij is not a zero.
1026920	1031800	Now the theorem or lemma is that this is actually an equivalent relation
1033000	1040920	and the orbits of the or quantum orbits are defined to be these equivalence classes
1040920	1050440	of this of this relation and so the how we connected with the isomorphism quantum isomorphism is that
1052200	1060920	if g and h are connected graphs then they are quantum isomorphic if and only if there exists g
1061960	1067400	one vertex in the first graph and one vertex in the second graph which are in the same orbit
1067400	1073400	of the union of the graphs which is sort of mimicking what is expected in classical
1073400	1078440	automorphism groups of graphs i will mention it also later. It is a very important theorem
1078440	1085160	which will actually provide us with the combinatorial tools that can be used to study
1085160	1092200	quantum automorphism groups of graphs and this is exactly the following so let g be a graph and
1093000	1096840	now i will define this two-dimensional Weissfer-Lehmann algorithm shortly
1097880	1103240	but it's some kind of algorithm that creates a partition on the graph which is
1103880	1110360	automorphism invariant in the classical automorphism group so we have this partition
1111320	1118600	of the vertices and which is constructed let's say by this two-dimensional Weissfer-Lehmann algorithm
1118600	1123160	and if two vertices belong in two different colors or partitions
1125160	1131160	then this pij is equal to zero so in other words they are in different quantum orbits
1132440	1139400	so so this is very important very very useful tool in general and it's actually
1140520	1148200	this result is due to also these people and this is very powerful tool powerful combinatorial tool
1148280	1155560	to use and it appears in many many different areas so it's actually i think quite fascinating result
1156600	1161720	and there is also and i will talk about this there is also a better version of this two-dimensional
1161720	1167000	Weissfer-Lehmann algorithm but it is no longer useful for quantum groups because as far as i
1167000	1174360	understand it's not really possible to define quantum quantum orbitals
1178120	1184040	like analogs of orbitals which are basically the orbits of the action of the group induced
1184040	1187400	on the Cartesian product of the set on which is acting so
1188280	1196760	yeah so if you remember in the beginning we had this slide where this notion of
1196760	1200840	k-dimensional Weissfer-Lehmann indistinguishability is equivalent to
1202280	1210360	homomorphism counts into graphs of this bounded trivite so then there was the result by
1210360	1217000	robertson manjiska which says that quantum isomorphism is equivalent to counting homomorphisms
1217000	1224280	from planar graphs so this is another reason why higher dimensional Weissfer-Lehmann doesn't work
1224280	1233160	here is this because all planar like all trivite graphs at most two are planar but trivite graphs
1233160	1241880	at most three are not all planar so that's another let's say reason why this Weissfer-Lehmann
1241880	1248200	doesn't work anymore in higher dimension now let's finally talk about this okay Weissfer-Lehmann
1248200	1253080	in a bit so now i want to a little bit talk about the graph isomorphism problem because that's
1253080	1258440	actually the motivation for this Weissfer-Lehmann algorithm so the graph isomorphism problem is
1258440	1265000	just the computational variant of this graph isomorphism so basically we'd get two graphs and
1265000	1271560	we want to answer yes if and only if the the graphs are isomorphic and there is actually
1271560	1277480	a polynomial time equivalent problem which is computing the generating set of the
1277480	1285960	automorphism group of the graph so actually this is very similar to what we said before about
1285960	1294440	quantum groups and quantum isomorphism that to to see this why why this is equivalent or at least
1294440	1299800	one direction is to just consider two connected graphs and then take the disjoint union and
1299800	1307480	basically if there is an automorphism taking one to the other then then we know that they
1307480	1312280	must be isomorphic when there is a generator in the generating set of the automorphism group
1312520	1320760	so the currently best known algorithm for graph isomorphism runs in this time which is called
1320760	1328760	quasi polynomial and it is actually heavily based on group theory and just why this problem is
1328760	1337000	actually interesting is that from the complexity theory point of view actually you can have basically
1337800	1344200	things that can happen and each of them would be very interesting like if so the goal is usually
1344200	1350280	to solve some problem in polynomial time and if you could solve it in polynomial time then it means
1350280	1357560	that you probably have to invent some new mathematics if it was mp complete which is like the notion of
1357560	1365880	algorithmic hardness then then something called polynomial time hierarchy collapses which is
1365880	1372040	basically part of complexity theory and if this collapses then many people believe that this doesn't
1372040	1378520	collapse so they believe there is evidence so that it should not be mp complete and when it's
1378520	1384360	intermediate somewhere in between then it would resolve the famous p versus mp question so so this
1384360	1388840	problem originated from some practical applications but actually for practical applications it's
1388840	1394040	pretty much solved actually by these vise or lemma that I will mention it works very well
1394040	1403960	in most of the practical cases but yeah so why is this problem actually difficult is that
1405320	1410920	these algorithms are actually heavily based on group theory and
1414360	1420920	one of the one of the main parts is to do some recursive algorithm and
1421320	1428600	the problem the problem are are different complication complicated actions of some large group
1428600	1436760	like if we have this simple graph then it has the automorphism group Sn and it has the so-called
1436760	1442280	natural action on the set one to five which basically doing what you expect to just permeate
1442280	1449160	the vertices but if you care to guess okay I'm missing an edge here oh no what is the
1449240	1452600	automorphism group of this graph which is the well-known peterson graph
1458360	1466040	yeah it's also s5 sorry s5 yes it was s5 yeah it's s5 but now it's acting like on 10 points
1467000	1477720	and actually you cannot find like partition into into non-trivial blocks
1480120	1488760	so like partition that is preserved by the action you can only partition it trivially
1489320	1495480	and this means that action is primitive and you cannot do recursion so the problem is in
1495480	1502600	this isomorphism testing with large large groups which have not quasi-polynomial order
1502600	1511880	but it is a large order and complicated action that you cannot decompose okay so let's get to this
1512600	1518520	vise-for-lemon so first the simpler version of the vise-for-lemon is just a color refinement
1518520	1523480	algorithm which is something that probably if you were given as a homework to solve the
1523560	1529560	isomorphism problem then probably this would be the first thing that would occur to you is that you
1529560	1539880	just take two graphs and you first color all the vertices uniformly and now you look at each vertex
1539880	1546360	and see how many what is the degree of that vertex and if you know that the degree is different then
1546360	1553400	you surely cannot map it to some other vertex with a different degree so then you can recall
1554040	1559240	the graph based on this you see that the blue vertices have the same degrees
1559240	1569320	and the red vertices have the same degrees now you iterate this process until you get something
1569320	1577560	stable that no longer can be refined and then basically if you end up with a different colorings
1577640	1585560	then you can say that these these things are definitely not isomorphic but if you end up
1585560	1592440	with somehow the same colorings then you really do not know now the vise-for-lemon algorithm
1592440	1600280	does something better so instead of just coloring the vertices it's coloring the pairs of vertices
1600920	1606360	right so how does it how does it work so here we have just this very simple
1606920	1614120	graph and if you want to depict the pairs of vertices we can just depict them by some arrows
1615720	1622600	so here is the the pairs of vertices that occur in this graph and we give it some
1622600	1628760	initial coloring or initial partition so this green color corresponds that there to the fact
1628760	1635720	that there is no edge here and this red color corresponds to the to the pairs of the form
1636520	1646120	uu let's say and this blue corresponds to the edges now we count we construct a new partition in the
1646120	1659160	next step yes in the initial coloring we and actually it will be recolored as you will see
1659160	1666760	so the in the initial coloring all pairs that correspond to the edges to the actual edges
1666760	1672120	will be colored the same and all pairs that correspond to the non-edges and the diagonal of the
1676520	1694440	yeah and in the next iteration we do the following counting so for each pair uv of some color k
1695800	1702600	and every ij we count the number of vertices such that there is such a triangle in the graph
1703160	1712440	so the base of the triangle is the uv with color k and we count the number of vertices w such that
1712440	1719560	there is the first step in color i and the second step in color j of course this k ij can be possibly
1720520	1727320	the same they don't have to be all distinct and then for each pair we do this count and then in the
1727320	1736840	next step we recolor the pairs based on these counts so the next step here would look something
1736840	1748600	like this so actually you will get some some new colors on on here and the color and the new colors
1748600	1755560	here and this actually makes sense because it should be approximating the orbits of the automorphism
1755560	1761880	group and this that this vertex got orange these two vertices got orange color and this
1761880	1767080	remained red actually makes sense because these two vertices here should be in a different orbit
1767080	1774120	and these vertex and of course it doesn't work perfectly but it works very well and of course
1774120	1780680	you can construct some examples where it doesn't work but it's a very as i said the connection
1780680	1786200	with the quantum groups is actually also approximates the quantum orbit so basically whatever
1786200	1792440	is distinguished by the vise for lemma you can also use it when studying the quantum group
1793720	1799800	okay so what we actually did we colored the aj-sense matrix and now the idea of this vise
1799800	1804120	for lemma you can think of it as basically constructing invariants in mathematics we
1804120	1812040	distinguished objects by constructing invariants like the dimension of a vector space of or more
1812040	1818600	complicated like in algebraic topology some homology groups so this is something similar
1818600	1826200	basically because we colored the aj-sense matrix and we actually constructed some coherent algebra
1826200	1833080	which is generated by the following matrices so to each color you can actually assign a zero
1833080	1842200	zero one matrix so like this uh so here you have uh some these these are basically zero one matrices
1842200	1848760	where the ones are exactly at those places which are of the same color and so in this case this
1848760	1855000	coordinate algebra would be generated by these five matrices and it is like a matrix algebra
1855000	1861880	satisfying the following condition so the first condition is that all of the matrices so this
1861880	1869240	generating matrices might sum up to all ones matrix so which is here clear that if you sum it all up
1869240	1879560	you get the all ones matrix so then there has to be has to be some some subset of the matrices
1879560	1885400	that sum up to identity so in this case it would be this orange matrix and this red matrix they
1885400	1892360	sum up to the identity so this basically tells you that is actually also approximating not only the
1892360	1898040	two orbits of the graph but also the orbits so it should be more powerful than just the degree
1898040	1907720	refinement and then if you take any pair of matrices if you use the bad student product the
1907720	1915240	component wise product or true product then then you get the zero matrix and then you have the
1915240	1923560	transpose matrix there it's like for example here we have a pair of transpose matrices and
1924200	1931560	then the last condition is that the product of the matrix can be expressed in such a in such a sum
1931560	1939400	and this number c i j actually are some constants that corresponds to this counting of triangles
1939400	1947080	when it's finally stable so we have this kind of matrix algebra on top of the graph and if these
1947080	1952920	algebras are isomorphic then or non-isomorphic then we can distinguish the graphs by this
1952920	1961800	Weisfer Lehmann and if they are the same then we cannot make a conclusion now you can go even
1973480	1982040	yes yes it's like basically it's the Weisfer Lehmann actually doesn't only have to be applied
1982120	1989640	for graphs you can start with any because each each each of these matrices zero matrices can be
1989640	1995880	also interpreted as just some binary relation right so you are basically starting with a bunch of
1995880	2001720	relations and the Weisfer Lehmann algorithm will find what is called a coherent closure
2003080	2008600	so the smallest coordinate algebra satisfying these conditions that contains those relations so
2008600	2013560	but when you want to apply it for graphs you start with the specific three relations that
2013560	2015800	I depicted but it's not necessary to do that
2026600	2033000	yeah yes in this case it's just the adjacency matrix but in general you can get you can start
2033000	2039640	with any bunch of relations yeah and you can go further you can do k-dimensional Weisfer Lehmann
2039640	2047560	so here instead of coloring k tuples sorry two tuples you will be coloring k tuples but I don't
2047560	2053800	want to get too much in today's because as I said it's not anymore relevant for quantum groups but
2055080	2061400	but there are some very interesting connections like for example the k-dimensional Weisfer Lehmann
2061400	2068120	distinguishes two graphs if and only if these graphs are distinguishable by k plus one
2068840	2077800	variable sentence with counting quantifiers so for example here you have two graphs that
2079640	2087960	this cycle and these two triangles so these are all regular graphs so one-dimensional Weisfer
2087960	2092680	which was the color refinement is actually also called one-dimensional Weisfer Lehmann algorithm
2094520	2099080	this doesn't distinguish these two graphs because all the vertices are the same degree
2099080	2104040	so it doesn't do anything basically but you can distinguish them with two-dimensional Weisfer Lehmann
2105480	2111480	and this would correspond to some formula in three variables
2111800	2119240	you can implement this distance formula between the two vertices with one extra variable so this
2119240	2126600	would be like a three variable formula that also distinguishes those two graphs so that's a
2126600	2131800	connection to logic and then there are many more very interesting connections like integer linear
2131800	2136360	programming as I said in the beginning the homomorphism counting that this homomorphism
2136360	2146360	in distinguishability for bounded three-width graphs is equivalent to to being distinguishable
2146360	2155720	by k-dimensional Weisfer Lehmann okay let's go somehow back to the quantum groups and
2156600	2163400	um so I uh what what we did in our work we basically
2166120	2173720	did a quantum group quantum underwater group of graph version of two classical results
2174760	2181240	and I will mention them now so first of all like uh Frux theorem is quite old and it says that for
2181320	2188360	every graph there or sorry for every group there you can construct a graph with the isomorphic
2188360	2194280	automorphism group and actually the quantum analog of this Frux theorem does not hold
2194920	2201080	even for quantum permutation groups and so but we are still interested in some quantum
2201080	2209480	automorphism groups of restricted classes of graphs because a lot of the results about quantum
2209480	2220120	automorphism groups of graphs were were in the spirit of analyzing whether a given graph has
2220120	2233960	or does not have quantum symmetry or maybe some calculations for for some for some specific
2233960	2241080	graphs let's say but uh it's it's kind of interesting that uh the the quantum
2241080	2250360	automorphism groups of trees which we looked at uh was was not so much now and so to do that I want
2250360	2256920	to recall a first product of groups so first product of groups and we will need the quantum
2256920	2262280	analog of that first product of groups uh is like when we want to determine the automorphism
2262280	2267480	group of two graphs if they are not isomorphic we can just use a direct product to construct the
2267480	2275640	automorphism group but if they are isomorphic no longer works with uh the uh direct product
2275640	2283000	because if you look at the structure of the automorphism group uh it's actually uh not a
2283000	2288440	direct product if it was a direct product then this uh front square and the back square is the
2288440	2295400	Cayley graph would be different so sorry the same if it was a direct product so it's just a
2295400	2300760	depiction nice depiction of the structure of the group uh but this uh is described by the
2300760	2310360	rest product and by that I just mean the following so uh if I have two groups and uh a set omega on
2310360	2318040	on which q is acting then I can take the direct product like for each for each element of the
2318040	2328680	set omega I take a group a copy of the group D and take the direct product of this and um
2330920	2337320	and then the rest product is actually naturally defined as a semi-direct product uh and the
2338120	2346600	the semi-direct product is defined by this action of of of q on the coordinates of this
2347160	2354680	let's say vectors or uh omega tuples in in in this direct product in a natural way
2355400	2362440	so just by action on the coordinates so that's the rest product and what we can do with this
2362440	2367080	red product is for example to determine the automorphism group of a disconnected graph
2367720	2374200	by the following formula so if we have like a bunch of copies of some graph then this
2374200	2381320	automorphism group will be just the automorphism group of the component uh rest producted with
2381320	2391160	the symmetric group and so in general if we have a bunch of connected components xi then we can use
2391160	2397240	the following formula to compute the whole automorphism group uh based on the automorphism
2397240	2404520	groups of the individual graphs and this actually can already give us a proof of a very neat theorem
2404520	2414040	and this is one of the result that we will have a quantum analog for so this maybe is a very
2414040	2420360	interesting theorem that could probably be even in some undergraduate course which basically gives
2420360	2428200	a description of all the automorphism groups of trees and it's and it's quite quite simple so
2428200	2436520	it's basically just an inductive description so there is a trivial group in the class and if
2436520	2440280	there are two groups then there is a direct product and if there is a group then there is
2440280	2448840	it's worth product with a symmetric group no so how to see this so if if we have uh if we have a
2448920	2454680	group g and h then we can construct a tree with the direct product just by putting those trees
2454680	2462040	onto a common root and maybe if g and h is the same so g equals h we can just add one vertex to
2462040	2467720	prevent swapping so that we have the direct product and if you want to construct the rest
2467720	2474680	product it's also easy we just take a copy of one tree uh or n copies of the tree then attach it to
2474680	2483400	the common root and we get the rest product with the symmetric group on the other hand if you want
2483400	2489800	to prove that these are all the groups then we can just take any tree delete delete the root
2490600	2495880	it's okay enough to consider root trees delete the root apply the formula from the previous
2495880	2502600	slides for disconnected graphs and notice that only only rest products and direct products
2502600	2508040	occur there so so so the group must be in this in this class
2510200	2517080	so now we have um let so the class qt is the class of all quantum automorphism groups of trees
2517640	2523320	that can be described as follows so here instead of the direct product we will have a free product
2523320	2529480	of the of the quantum groups and instead of the rest product we'll just have uh the so-called
2529480	2536920	free rest product with a quantum symmetry group s and plus there is which which contains the
2538760	2547160	contains the classical symmetry group and here um yeah it's just mentioned what I already said
2547160	2553640	and there was a result by Fulton in 2006 who actually showed that the automorphism that the
2553640	2561880	trees which have classical automorphism group s2 to the k have quantum symmetry but uh yeah this is
2562520	2571880	of course contained in our result as well and um only recently only recently uh there has been
2571880	2576200	almost at the same time publish a paper by some other person who I forgot the name
2576200	2582840	but he actually also arrived to this result that we have and also for maybe some other classes of
2582840	2592040	graphs uh by using completely different methods so doesn't use vice for lemma or so on so here I
2592040	2599480	have again the definition of the quantum automorphism group of a graph but I can just go quickly
2599480	2607880	because here um we have um just what we need something more is to add some condition so
2607880	2613240	because we want to work with colored graphs right so we want to have uh some colors on the
2613240	2620120	vertices and we want to preserve these colors so we just there is just some extra condition for that
2620760	2626680	here is mentioned again quantum isomorphism let's just go further and uh so with quantum
2626680	2633080	automorphism groups something that is uh very easy in the classical automorphism groups has to be
2633080	2639640	checked very carefully so we have some bunch of operations that we use and for each we have to
2639640	2645480	prove that this actually preserves the quantum automorphism group uh but this may be very obvious
2645480	2650920	in the classical way but still we need it so one of the operation is for example that if you have
2650920	2657640	just an independent set which is a union of colors then we can add edges between all the pairs of
2657640	2664520	vertices in s so just something like this right so you have two color classes and you just add
2664520	2670040	all the edges between that uh I mean it's a very simple thing but it has to be checked carefully
2670040	2676200	with quantum groups um or adding a complete bipartite graph between two disjoint sets that
2676200	2683880	are also union of color classes so something like this you have some color classes and you add like
2683880	2689080	a complete bipartite graph between these so this also preserves quantum automorphism group
2689880	2696440	or changing this is like very very seems very trivial that changing the color of some monochromatic
2696440	2702840	vertex set to a different color or adding an isolated vertex of a color that no longer existed
2703560	2708360	so because what do what we want to do we want to with quantum groups we also want to use some
2708360	2717960	similar kind of induction as is used for regular trees but um we need to transfer from regular
2717960	2725000	trees um sorry regular automorphism groups of trees we need to transfer from under unrooted
2725000	2731480	trees to rooted trees so that we have some option for an induction and we we basically use this
2731480	2738040	simple operation that we proved that preserve quantum automorphism groups to to replace undirected
2738040	2746040	trees with rooted trees so how is it done like using this operation is very simple so you just
2746040	2752440	color the vertices then you remove an edge so you can also reverse the operation then you add a
2752440	2758840	vertex of a different color then you add like the complete bipartite graph between two color
2758840	2764840	classes and then you uncolor and so it seems very trivial but somehow with quantum groups one has
2764840	2770520	to check everything carefully that it works so it's like the process of rotification you can just
2771400	2778520	basically introduce a root to to an unrooted tree oh i forgot to mention that every tree has a center
2779320	2785000	which is either a vertex and edge which is like a vertex and edge which is like a subset of vertices
2785000	2793960	that is equally distant from the leaves of the tree and we do this this process that was depicted
2793960	2800760	here with the center and that is also de-rotification so so really that the class of rooted trees is
2800760	2806360	exactly the same as an unrooted tree so rooted trees are basically just like trees with one
2806360	2813240	distinguished vertex with one colored vertex which has to be preserved so here we if we have a rooted
2813240	2819320	tree what we can do is basically attach a very long path to it and then basically we force
2819800	2824200	force the center to be somewhere on the path because it will be very very long
2825560	2830440	longer than any path in the tree and then we then then we can
2832280	2838120	unrooted and basically we we will get that the automorphism or quantum automorphism group is the same
2840120	2848680	so then i will maybe not define everything just go over this probably you're familiar with
2849320	2856120	free products of quantum groups and then there is a free breast product of a quantum group so
2857240	2865720	it's basically this analog of the the direct product and and
2867640	2878360	breast product of groups and we have two important lemmas that are also analog of what is what we
2878360	2885800	proved for this or what is known for these classical automorphism groups that if we if we
2885800	2892120	basically have a bunch of color color graphs that are all connected we have some components
2893000	2898680	and these components are not quantum isomorphic in this case then actually the quantum automorphism
2898680	2903960	group of this de-joint union of graphs can be just expressed as a free pre-product of this
2903960	2913880	quantum automorphism groups and similarly if we have like a connected vertex color graph and if
2913880	2921800	we take n copies of this graph then the quantum automorphism group of this digital union is
2921800	2927240	expressed as a free breast product with the quantum symmetry group and i didn't actually
2927240	2932440	mentioned how we are actually using the vice for lemma here but the vice for lemma here is used
2932440	2943640	in such a way that basically vice for lemma can distinguish all trees so since it can distinguish
2943640	2953320	all trees then it's enough to decide isomorphism for them so it's also enough to decide quantum
2953320	2961640	automorphisms for them so in other words thanks to these trees are isomorphic if and only if there
2961640	2969640	are quantum isomorph so that's why we can apply these things for trees and putting these things
2969640	2976760	together we get this equivalent or equivalent the quantum version characterization of the
2976760	2986920	quantum automorphism groups of trees another result that i will mention is the sabidusis theorem
2987640	2996520	so this theorem says about lexicographic products of graphs so here is like some
2997240	3001960	technical definition but it's very easy what is a lexicographic product of
3001960	3008760	product of graphs so basically this is a lexicographic product of a cycle with k2 which is an edge
3009560	3016920	so basically we take for each vertex of the outer graph we take a copy of the inner graph so
3016920	3026760	like here we have four red edges and put all possible edges between the copies if there was
3026760	3033480	an edge in the c4 so basically we just take a bunch of for each vertex of the outer graph
3033480	3041400	we take a copy of the inner graph and and put complete bipartite graphs between those copies
3041400	3049640	if there was an edge in the outer graph x and the sabidusis theorem says that the automorphism group
3049640	3059160	of of this lexicographic product of two graphs is described as a breath product of the corresponding
3059160	3067560	automorphism groups if and only if some condition holds what is the condition so this is actually
3067560	3076440	two conditions written in one so if this inner graph is disconnected then the outer graphs should
3076440	3084440	have no twins twins are vertices that have see exactly the same neighborhoods so you can imagine
3084520	3091160	if this inner graph was disconnected and there were twins in the outer graph you can think of
3091160	3097000	how you could create extra automorphisms that are actually not in this breath product so this
3097000	3103080	breath product will be a subgroup always but the equality happens if this kind of condition is
3103080	3113160	satisfied for for the graphs right so in this case this is like s2 breath product with d4
3113160	3122360	the dihedral group and the quantum version is just that we replace we replace automorphism groups
3122360	3133880	with quantum automorphism groups and we get a free breath product in there and just in all proved
3133880	3143880	the result by completely different methods some years ago just for regular graphs so just for
3143880	3150280	graphs which have the same degree at every vertex so we obtained basically probably a much more
3150280	3158680	elementary proof for this and we prove it for all graphs so we we make a quantum version of the
3158680	3167400	sabidu CTRM and here we actually use the Weisner-Lehmann algorithm more deeply
3169560	3174360	so I'm not going to now go into these counts let's just ignore that for now
3175640	3180520	so but basically what we have to do we have to just follow the Weisner-Lehmann algorithm
3180520	3186520	and see that the inner and outer edges so what we want to basically prove
3186520	3193640	because what are these what are these automorphisms in a classical case what what should they do
3194760	3200520	you should have if this is just an equality you should have just two types of automorphisms those
3201080	3209080	that follow the structure of the outer graph and those that act inside the inner graphs
3210040	3216680	this is just two types of automorphisms that should be there in case there is an equality
3217960	3225960	and what we use the Weisner-Lehmann to do is that we prove that the Weisner-Lehmann actually
3225960	3231400	distinguishes all the inner edges and all the outer edges so this is just a purely
3231400	3238200	combinatorial result but thanks to the connection of Weisner-Lehmann and the quantum groups we can
3239400	3246840	it actually helps to also analyze the quantum groups so it's not clear how actually Sabidouci
3246840	3254760	proved it in his original paper because this is something from the 50s and it was there were
3254760	3261000	several iterations for the papers there were several mistakes in it like it was at least
3261000	3267240	three times corrected or two times and but he must have done something similar he must
3267960	3271160	somehow distinguish the inner edges and outer edges but
3273080	3278760	but the Weisner-Lehmann algorithm is much more elegant way to do it and we also
3279880	3285800	not only update the quantum version of Sabidouci but I think we prove the Sabidouci theorem in an
3285800	3293640	elegant way and maybe I'm coming to it to the end and
3297000	3305640	okay let's just quickly go over this thing here so we could we could then actually also prove this
3308200	3313880	yeah so we actually do the then do the same we could prove it by ourselves but it's easier to
3313880	3321240	use this existing result by Banika and Bishon where they actually define yet another kind of
3321240	3329240	product of graphs which is the free they call it free product of graphs but and they I'm not going
3329240	3336280	to define it because it's not that important now and they prove that this quantum automorphism group
3336280	3343000	of this free product of graphs is also the rest product so and for us to use the free product
3343080	3349880	is actually exactly what we need from the Weisner-Lehmann is this partition of this inner
3350520	3357240	and outer edges and non-edges and then we can just very simplifying it now then we can plug in
3357240	3362600	to this Banika and Bishon and this is exactly what is doing just in all who proved this only
3362600	3371160	for regular graphs he's also using this result by Banika and Bishon and yeah and just just
3374760	3379400	yeah so we prove that under the sabidusi condition the quantum automorphism group
3380120	3386840	of this lexicographic product of graphs what we what we want is exactly equal to the quantum
3386840	3394600	automorphism group of this free product of these graphs where they are colored based on these colors
3394600	3401960	that we obtained from Weisner-Lehmann and with this color because this free product of graphs by
3401960	3409160	Banika and Bishon is by is using some colors and we use exactly these colors from Weisner-Lehmann
3409160	3419880	to plug into their product basically and yeah so maybe I almost ran out of time here is just
3421240	3429240	a very small cherry on top is that you can also you you can prove a version of this sabidusi
3429240	3436360	TORM for vertex transitive graphs this means that the two the graphs have just one orbit
3436360	3445720	in their automorphism group and yeah let's just not go over this anymore but the theorem is basically
3445720	3454840	that if it's not the case that the equality occurs in the sabidusi theorem then for vertex
3454840	3461720	transitive graphs you can still find a formula for the automorphism group and the quantum version
3461800	3471160	happens to be exactly the same okay so let's just mention some problems at the end so something
3471160	3478680	that we already have in progress is to and there we have to do much more quantum groups
3479320	3486680	is to define inhomogeneous free rest product so you have this rest product of groups
3487560	3495720	where you have a group acting on some set and now to each element of this set you assign a group
3495720	3503160	now you can consider the orbits in this action and for each orbit you could pick a different group
3503160	3509000	so in this way you get an inhomogeneous rest product of groups which somehow generalizes
3509000	3515080	the rest product and it would be interesting to have a quantum group analog of that and see
3515800	3522040	what it what can be done with it so maybe apply it for some further graph classes
3523160	3527880	like planar graphs for example and planar graphs this there are some problems even in planar
3527880	3533400	graphs that are not clear and it might be very interesting for people working in geometry because
3535080	3540520	if you wanted to determine the automorphism groups of planar graphs there is a key case
3540520	3547720	of so-called three connected planar graphs if you don't want to so three connected planar graphs
3548760	3557800	basically corresponds to the graphs of polytopes and Mani's theorem says that they can be uniquely
3557800	3562600	embedded into the sphere in such a way that the automorphisms of the three connected planar
3562600	3568200	graphs exactly correspond to isometries of the sphere so the automorphism groups of three
3568200	3575880	connected planar graphs are exactly the finite subgroups of O3 and so these are some infinite
3575880	3586040	families of groups and the symmetric groups of platonic solids and so quantum Mani's theorem or
3586360	3597960	or yeah or and maybe because there is a quantum group O plus three so there might be something
3597960	3604760	there so look at maybe quantum automorphism groups of three connected planar graphs even that would
3604760	3608440	be very interesting I think so that's it
3617560	3623320	answer very much for that very interesting talk do we have any questions either in person or perhaps
3623320	3628920	we have something
3639720	3644920	yes
3644920	3649920	How do they respond to this?
3649920	3670920	Quantum on the resume group of a complete graph should be the SM plus, the quantum permutation group.
3670920	3690920	Actually, I don't know much about the result, I just heard a talk which claimed this, but yeah, I think it should be definitely true that there is no quantum analog for proof theorem, but I don't know exactly the statement from the top of my head, what is exactly the statement that they proved in that.
3690920	3700920	It was proven by, I think, Bishop McCarthy.
3700920	3715920	And when you mentioned the flux sum and the failure in the quantum sense, what I was wondering is there, so if it fails for graphs, I mean, is there some other structure for which there is a version, a quantum version of.
3715920	3724920	Yeah, I don't know, but yeah, it's an interesting question, but I don't know.
3725920	3734920	Well, classically, the point is that every group is a permutation group.
3734920	3748920	So every group acts on itself, but if you have a quantum group, then one group is not a classical space, and quantum permutation groups in this sense are symmetries of classical spaces.
3748920	3772920	So if you want it, a quantum proof theorem, you actually should not consider classical graphs, but quantum graphs, some graph structure on quantum, on some algebra, non-quimitorial algebra.
3773920	3791920	I wanted to ask, again, for the difference between the Weisfeller-Lehmann and the quantum isomorphism, so is the difference quantified somehow more precisely, how much is different?
3791920	3818920	So in terms of computability, there's a huge difference, but for how many graphs, the orbits are different by Weisfeller-Lehmann or quantum automorphism, or do we know some examples of pairs of graphs that cannot be distinguished by Weisfeller-Lehmann,
3818920	3822920	but they are not quantum isomorphic or something in this sense.
3822920	3835920	Like, if I understand it correctly, like if you, so if they are not distinguished by two-dimensional Weisfeller-Lehmann, or because...
3835920	3839920	I don't think it tries strongly regular graphs.
3839920	3840920	Yeah, I...
3840920	3847920	Because Weisfeller-Lehmann says classically, it tries strongly regular graphs, it stops in the beginning.
3847920	3853920	That's like, yeah, maybe.
3853920	3863920	Then maybe you want the other extreme where Weisfeller-Lehmann works fine, but the quantum algorithm or whatever...
3863920	3864920	Isomorphism.
3864920	3865920	Isomorphism.
3865920	3880920	It is basically the same, but classically, more complex than these, but far from strongly regular graphs.
3880920	3881920	Yeah, yeah, right.
3881920	3889920	That would also be interesting to have some larger class of graphs where we know that Weisfeller-Lehmann would answer the question.
3889920	3891920	Well, power graphs.
3891920	3893920	Well, power graphs is not clear.
3893920	3902920	For power graphs, it's not clear whether two-dimensional Weisfeller-Lehmann will answer the question.
3902920	3915920	So power graphs is actually the open problem, whether two-dimensional Weisfeller-Lehmann will distinguish them, but currently it's known that three-dimensional Weisfeller-Lehmann distinguishes power graphs.
3915920	3919920	And the open question is whether also two-dimensional distinguish them.
3919920	3921920	And yeah, maybe.
3921920	3930920	But people believe it's going to be true.
3930920	3937920	Like you mean it's conjectured that it works even for the classical automobiles.
3937920	3938920	Yes.
3938920	3939920	Yeah, right.
3939920	3952920	But for the classical, it is not clear whether two-dimensional, two-dimensional, three-dimensional, five-dimensional, about one-thousand.
3952920	3960920	Yeah, well, if the classical conjecture was true, then it's not that interesting for the quantum place.
3960920	3963920	But if it was not true, then maybe it is.
3963920	3964920	Yeah.
3964920	3968920	Yeah, that's a good question.
3968920	3979920	Not any other.
3979920	3985920	So can you explain where this undiscibility comes from?
3985920	3987920	Why it is not decidable?
3987920	3991920	Because in the classical case, you just check all the bijections.
3991920	3997920	But why here there is problem that there is no algorithm?
3997920	4002920	Yeah, I don't know the problem.
4002920	4010920	But you must check, I mean, it should be the problem that you have to check infinitely many possibilities.
4010920	4014920	Otherwise stupid algorithms would exist.
4014920	4020920	Yep.
4020920	4021920	What?
4021920	4030920	So if there's nothing further, then maybe let's thank our speaker again.
4030920	4036920	And next week, we will have somebody.
4036920	4038920	I hope you will join us.
