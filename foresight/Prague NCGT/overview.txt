Checking Prague NCGT/Peter Zeman.txt
1. The talk was about the difference between classical and quantum graph isomorphism problems. In the classical setting, the Graph Isomorphism Problem (GIP) is decidable, meaning there's an algorithm that can determine if any two given graphs are isomorphic. However, in the quantum setting, this problem becomes undecidable due to the complexity of quantum states and operations.

2. The speaker mentioned a result by Bishop McCarthy regarding the automorphism group of a complete graph. The quantum analog should be the symmetric measuring plus (SMP+) group, which is a quantum permutation group. There's no quantum equivalent of the proof theorem for graphs, as there is in the classical case.

3. The flux sum and its failure in the quantum context was discussed, indicating that while certain properties may translate from the classical to the quantum realm, others do not, necessitating a different approach for quantum structures.

4. Quantum permutation groups are symmetries of classical spaces within quantum theory. A quantum proof theorem would require considering quantum graphs or other quantum structures where groups are represented non-commutatively.

5. The Weisfeller-Lehmann theorem and the quantum isomorphism were compared. The Weisfeller-Lehmann theorem provides a computable method to determine if two finite undirected graphs are isomorphic classically. In contrast, quantum isomorphisms may differ even when Weisfeller-Lehmann says they are the same, due to the non-commutative nature of quantum operations.

6. It was pointed out that for certain classes of graphs like power graphs, it's not clear if two-dimensional Weisfeller-Lehmann can distinguish them, although three-dimensional Weisfeller-Lehmann does. This is an open question in the classical setting, and its implications for the quantum case are still being explored.

7. The undecidability of the quantum graph isomorphism problem stems from the fact that there are infinitely many possibilities to check, which precludes the existence of a finite algorithm. In contrast, the classical GIP can be solved by checking all possible bijections between the sets of vertices of the two graphs, assuming we have a finite number of graphs to consider.

8. The session concluded with a thank you to our speaker and an announcement for next week's talk, inviting everyone to join.
