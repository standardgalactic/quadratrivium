00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Howdy! The goal of this series of classes is to make you fall in love with bioinformatics.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,240
Whatever you are studying now, computer science or biology or mathematics, we want you to

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,560
consider bioinformatics as well. Why? Because bioinformatics is a new frontier in all these

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:28,720
disciplines and because it is built on all of them. I first learned about bioinformatics

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,280
when I was completing my PhD in discrete mathematics a quarter-century ago. And the

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,400
moment I heard about this futuristic new discipline on the interface of computing and biology,

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:48,920
I instantly switched and never looked back. At that time, bioinformatics was an obscure

8
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:55,400
discipline, but today it is a huge field that is making a digital revolution in biology

9
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:04,000
and that opened the era of personalized medicine. But one thing has not changed. Bioinformatics

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,640
remains the same frontier, the same wild west as it was a quarter-century ago. And that

11
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,320
is why we are wearing this crazy outfit. You mean apart from the fact that they look

12
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,480
good on us? Sure. In this specialization, we're going to discuss many questions that

13
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:28,160
are asked in modern biology and medicine, such as which animal gave us SARS? Or do we

14
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:34,800
have a clock gene? Or how is it that we find disease-causing mutations? After we ask each

15
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,920
of these biological questions, we'll then learn about the computational approaches

16
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,800
that are used to solve them, from clustering algorithms to evolutionary tree construction

17
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,840
to machine learning approaches. Along the way, we're going to travel back in time to

18
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,920
solve a 300-year-old mathematical problem. Wander around Manhattan as tourists. We'll

19
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,960
even get lost in a Japanese casino run by Yakuza. All of these adventures may sound like risky

20
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:08,600
propositions, but we hope that you will join us to see what they have to do with bioinformatics.

21
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,720
Although these instructors may appear crazy, they are not quite as mad as they look. Dr.

22
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,160
Pavel Pevzner is a distinguished professor of computer science at the University of

23
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,600
California, San Diego, and a leading authority on bioinformatics. He's dressed this way

24
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,680
because he sometimes thinks that he's a sheriff of bioinformatics, a frontier discipline underpinning

25
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,960
the digital revolution in biology and personalized medicine. Dr. Philip Campo is an assistant

26
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,040
professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. To learn why he is dressed

27
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,440
this way, you'll need to take this course or read the textbook by bioinformatics algorithms

28
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,280
and active learning approach co-authored by the two speakers.
