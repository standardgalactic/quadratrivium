Howdy! The goal of this series of classes is to make you fall in love with bioinformatics.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.240
Whatever you are studying now, computer science or biology or mathematics, we want you to

00:15.240 --> 00:21.560
consider bioinformatics as well. Why? Because bioinformatics is a new frontier in all these

00:21.560 --> 00:28.720
disciplines and because it is built on all of them. I first learned about bioinformatics

00:28.720 --> 00:35.280
when I was completing my PhD in discrete mathematics a quarter-century ago. And the

00:35.280 --> 00:41.400
moment I heard about this futuristic new discipline on the interface of computing and biology,

00:41.400 --> 00:48.920
I instantly switched and never looked back. At that time, bioinformatics was an obscure

00:48.920 --> 00:55.400
discipline, but today it is a huge field that is making a digital revolution in biology

00:55.400 --> 01:04.000
and that opened the era of personalized medicine. But one thing has not changed. Bioinformatics

01:04.000 --> 01:11.640
remains the same frontier, the same wild west as it was a quarter-century ago. And that

01:11.640 --> 01:17.320
is why we are wearing this crazy outfit. You mean apart from the fact that they look

01:17.320 --> 01:22.480
good on us? Sure. In this specialization, we're going to discuss many questions that

01:22.480 --> 01:28.160
are asked in modern biology and medicine, such as which animal gave us SARS? Or do we

01:28.160 --> 01:34.800
have a clock gene? Or how is it that we find disease-causing mutations? After we ask each

01:34.800 --> 01:38.920
of these biological questions, we'll then learn about the computational approaches

01:38.920 --> 01:43.800
that are used to solve them, from clustering algorithms to evolutionary tree construction

01:43.800 --> 01:48.840
to machine learning approaches. Along the way, we're going to travel back in time to

01:48.840 --> 01:54.920
solve a 300-year-old mathematical problem. Wander around Manhattan as tourists. We'll

01:54.920 --> 02:00.960
even get lost in a Japanese casino run by Yakuza. All of these adventures may sound like risky

02:00.960 --> 02:08.600
propositions, but we hope that you will join us to see what they have to do with bioinformatics.

02:08.600 --> 02:13.720
Although these instructors may appear crazy, they are not quite as mad as they look. Dr.

02:13.840 --> 02:18.160
Pavel Pevzner is a distinguished professor of computer science at the University of

02:18.160 --> 02:23.600
California, San Diego, and a leading authority on bioinformatics. He's dressed this way

02:23.600 --> 02:29.680
because he sometimes thinks that he's a sheriff of bioinformatics, a frontier discipline underpinning

02:29.680 --> 02:35.960
the digital revolution in biology and personalized medicine. Dr. Philip Campo is an assistant

02:35.960 --> 02:41.040
professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. To learn why he is dressed

02:41.040 --> 02:46.440
this way, you'll need to take this course or read the textbook by bioinformatics algorithms

02:46.440 --> 02:50.280
and active learning approach co-authored by the two speakers.
