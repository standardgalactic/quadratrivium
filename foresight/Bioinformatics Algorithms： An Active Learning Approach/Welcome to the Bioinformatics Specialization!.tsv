0	10000	Howdy! The goal of this series of classes is to make you fall in love with bioinformatics.
10000	15240	Whatever you are studying now, computer science or biology or mathematics, we want you to
15240	21560	consider bioinformatics as well. Why? Because bioinformatics is a new frontier in all these
21560	28720	disciplines and because it is built on all of them. I first learned about bioinformatics
28720	35280	when I was completing my PhD in discrete mathematics a quarter-century ago. And the
35280	41400	moment I heard about this futuristic new discipline on the interface of computing and biology,
41400	48920	I instantly switched and never looked back. At that time, bioinformatics was an obscure
48920	55400	discipline, but today it is a huge field that is making a digital revolution in biology
55400	64000	and that opened the era of personalized medicine. But one thing has not changed. Bioinformatics
64000	71640	remains the same frontier, the same wild west as it was a quarter-century ago. And that
71640	77320	is why we are wearing this crazy outfit. You mean apart from the fact that they look
77320	82480	good on us? Sure. In this specialization, we're going to discuss many questions that
82480	88160	are asked in modern biology and medicine, such as which animal gave us SARS? Or do we
88160	94800	have a clock gene? Or how is it that we find disease-causing mutations? After we ask each
94800	98920	of these biological questions, we'll then learn about the computational approaches
98920	103800	that are used to solve them, from clustering algorithms to evolutionary tree construction
103800	108840	to machine learning approaches. Along the way, we're going to travel back in time to
108840	114920	solve a 300-year-old mathematical problem. Wander around Manhattan as tourists. We'll
114920	120960	even get lost in a Japanese casino run by Yakuza. All of these adventures may sound like risky
120960	128600	propositions, but we hope that you will join us to see what they have to do with bioinformatics.
128600	133720	Although these instructors may appear crazy, they are not quite as mad as they look. Dr.
133840	138160	Pavel Pevzner is a distinguished professor of computer science at the University of
138160	143600	California, San Diego, and a leading authority on bioinformatics. He's dressed this way
143600	149680	because he sometimes thinks that he's a sheriff of bioinformatics, a frontier discipline underpinning
149680	155960	the digital revolution in biology and personalized medicine. Dr. Philip Campo is an assistant
155960	161040	professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. To learn why he is dressed
161040	166440	this way, you'll need to take this course or read the textbook by bioinformatics algorithms
166440	170280	and active learning approach co-authored by the two speakers.
