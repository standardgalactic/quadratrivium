1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
It is a great honor to be introducing, albeit virtually, the holder of the Vannevar Busch

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,400
endow chair and a distinguished professor in the biology department at Tufts, Professor

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,200
Michael Levin.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,680
Director of the Island Discovery Center at Tufts, as well as the Tufts Center for Regenerative

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,960
and Developmental Biology, Michael studies the bioelectrical codes that cells use during

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,200
the development, injury or regeneration of an organism, and deciphering these codes,

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,080
cellular language gives you access to the messages these cells exchange with each other.

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,520
So if you can start speaking it, you can make repurposing suggestions, you can instruct

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,520
the cellular decisions.

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,960
It is probably impossible to summarize neatly the work that Michael Levin has done.

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,240
He's working at the, like his work actually is the epitome between computer science and

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:01,160
biology, and I will just mention two of his projects, Xenobots, and distinguishing left

13
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,320
from right, and I will leave the stage to him for his talk from physics to mind, the

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,320
journey of cognition seen through the lens of embryonic development.

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:18,320
Thank you so much, let's see, here we go, hopefully you can see my slides.

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Thank you for, let's start from the beginning.

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,400
Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to share some ideas with you at this amazing

18
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,400
workshop.

19
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,400
Anyone who's interested can contact me or get any of the primary data sets, the software,

20
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,400
all the details, all the protocols, everything else you can get here.

21
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,400
What I thought I would try to do is give you an overview of some of the ideas that we've

22
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,480
been working on and some of their practical implications.

23
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,480
So one of the kind of key things to think about is that many people, when they think

24
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,480
about a cognition, they think about a human, and we all think we know what a human is.

25
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,480
But as Cyril says, sometimes we have to look a little closer at these ideas.

26
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:11,480
And the fact is that all of us began life as just physics, that is, we were all a quiescent

27
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,560
oocyte at one point, a little blob of chemicals, and that one might look and might say, well,

28
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,560
that's just chemistry, there's no cognition or decision making there.

29
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,560
But eventually this becomes, through an extremely slow and gradual process, step by step, this

30
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,560
becomes one of these complex creatures, including perhaps one with metacognition that makes

31
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,560
claims about anthropomorphisms and being different from other types of physical objects

32
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,560
and so on.

33
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,640
And so it's really important to ask ourselves, how is it that we make this journey across

34
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,640
the Cartesian cut?

35
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,640
How do we get from here to here?

36
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,640
Now, Alan Turing needs no introduction, and he was very interested in unconventional

37
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,640
embodiments of mind, he wanted to know what intelligence was as abstracted from current

38
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,640
implementations in the natural world.

39
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,720
But interestingly enough, he also wrote a paper on morphogenesis, on the creation of

40
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,720
shape in chemical systems.

41
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,720
And you might wonder, why would somebody who's interested in intelligence and computation

42
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,720
be interested in developmental biology in that way?

43
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,720
And I think that this is yet another facet of his brilliance in that he saw, I think,

44
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,720
a deep truth, which is that these two questions are fundamentally the same question, the question

45
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:33,800
of intelligence, unified intelligence in the mind and the self-assembly of the body are

46
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
fundamentally the same question.

47
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,800
And this is a perspective from which we do a lot of our work.

48
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,800
So one thing that people will often say is that things like ant colonies and flocks of

49
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,800
birds and so on, our collective intelligence is maybe, and we can sort of argue about whether

50
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,800
it makes sense for any given collective to call it a collective intelligence.

51
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,880
But then we think, well, we are not like that.

52
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,880
We are not like a flock of birds or a collection of ants.

53
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,880
We have our true unified intelligence.

54
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:10,880
But I think we need to be very clear that this is just a matter of scale and a particular

55
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,880
lens that we use to view ourselves.

56
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,880
If you actually dig in, what you find out that we are all made of parts, in fact, I

57
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,880
would say that all intelligences are collective intelligences.

58
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,880
We are all made of parts.

59
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,960
So inside of our supposedly unified brain and inside the pineal gland that Descartes

60
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,960
thought was very important because there was just one of them.

61
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,960
Sure, there's just one of them.

62
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,960
But if you look in, what do you see?

63
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,960
You see cells.

64
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,960
And inside of these cells, you see this unbelievably rich mosaic of functional systems that are

65
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,960
doing all kinds of stuff.

66
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,960
This is what's inside every single cell of your body.

67
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,960
So we are all collective intelligences and we are made of something that looks a little

68
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,960
bit like this.

69
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,040
This is a free living organism known as the lacrimaria.

70
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,040
There is no brain.

71
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,040
There's no nervous system.

72
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,040
But you can see what's going on here.

73
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,040
This creature is incredibly competent in handling its small scale goals, so single cell level

74
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:11,040
goals, such as physiological goals, anatomical goals and metabolic goals.

75
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,040
And if you're into soft robotics or something like that, you'd be very jealous of this.

76
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,040
We don't really have anything that has this incredible level of control.

77
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:27,120
And we are, in fact, made of diverse cells with all kinds of competencies such as these

78
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,120
that work together on very large projects, whereas individual cells work on single level

79
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,120
cell goals, such as proliferation and metabolic states.

80
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,380
What I'm going to show you is that collections of cells can work on very large goals, such

81
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,180
as making things like this.

82
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,120
So let's think about what this kind of architecture, this is a very unique architecture, what does

83
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,120
allow us to do?

84
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,400
Well, for example, it raises some profound questions.

85
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,480
So here's a caterpillar.

86
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,320
This is a soft-bodied creature.

87
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,400
It has a brain suitable for crawling around on leaves and eating leaves.

88
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,280
So it sort of lives in a two-dimensional world.

89
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,120
It has to turn into this, which is a butterfly, which lives in a three-dimensional world.

90
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,200
It's a hard-bodied kind of creature, completely different controller needed to drive this than

91
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
to drive this.

92
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,560
It has a different brain.

93
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,700
During this process, the brain is largely taken apart.

94
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,100
Many of the cells die, most of the connections are taken apart.

95
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,700
But one of the amazing things is that there are data that show that memories persist.

96
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,300
So if you teach something to a caterpillar, the moth or a butterfly actually retains the

97
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:33,380
information despite this incredible rearrangement of the cognitive medium here.

98
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,060
So you can ask some very basic questions.

99
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,660
We've thought about this issue of what's it like to be a butterfly, but moreover, what's

100
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,380
it like to be a caterpillar changing into a butterfly?

101
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:52,500
You are an agent and during your lifetime, your mind, your body completely rearranged,

102
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,180
but some of the memories remain.

103
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,700
This is even taken even further by this model system.

104
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,700
These are planaria.

105
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,060
These are flatworms.

106
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,100
And the thing about flatworms is that they are incredibly regenerative.

107
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,580
So every part of the body can be regenerated.

108
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,860
So pieces regrow a whole new head with a brain and everything.

109
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:15,980
And what McConnell found in the 1960s, and we have since replicated using modern automated

110
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,580
equipment that we've made, is this amazing fact that if you take a planarian and you

111
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:28,340
train them on a specific task, so to look for food in these little bumpy kinds of regions,

112
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,900
then what you can do is you can amputate the entire head.

113
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,100
The tail will sit there doing nothing for about eight to 10 days.

114
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,660
Then eventually they regrow a new brain, behavior begins.

115
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,060
And then you find out that actually during this time, what had happened was information

116
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:46,100
that was stored in the rest of the body was somehow imprinted onto this new brain.

117
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,620
Not only is information stored outside the brain, and they have a true centralized brain

118
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:56,420
that would just like we do, they're not like a distributed starfish or anything.

119
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:01,460
Not only can information be stored outside of the brain, but actually can be moved through

120
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,180
the body and can be imprinted onto a brand new fresh brain.

121
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,540
And so then you can sort of ask philosophical questions like that, the malfunctioning transporter

122
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,540
experiment.

123
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,820
What happens if somebody makes a copy of you and forgets to destroy the original?

124
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,140
This actually happens in planaria.

125
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:23,540
You can cut this thing into pieces, and every piece is in an important way, both in physical

126
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:27,260
and somatic and cognitive continuity with the original.

127
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,620
So you can see there's this biology has this amazing plasticity and also this relationship

128
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,300
between behavioral memories and anatomical memories.

129
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:41,140
And when we'll talk more about this, that plasticity extends to vertebrates.

130
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,020
So what we've done here is, this is the work of Doug Blackistan in our group.

131
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,660
This is a tappel of the frog Xenopus lavas.

132
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,660
Here are the nostrils.

133
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,660
Here's the mouth.

134
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,660
Here's the brain.

135
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,900
And you'll notice there are no eyes up here.

136
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,700
We prevented these eyes from forming, but we did put an eye on the tail.

137
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,860
And I'll show you in a few minutes how we do that.

138
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,780
What we find out is that when you make animals like this and you test them using this behavior

139
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:06,340
testing apparatus that we built, it's an automated training and testing device, what

140
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,260
you find is that these animals can see quite well.

141
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,260
And in fact, these eyes form, even though they're sitting in the middle of muscle instead

142
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,380
of in their normal position in the brain, they make an optic nerve.

143
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,940
The optic nerve does not connect to the brain, at best it connects to the spinal cord right

144
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,940
here.

145
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:27,340
And without eons of evolutionary adaptation, without any of that, immediately out of the

146
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:33,340
box, these animals can see with this radically different sensory architecture.

147
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:38,300
So as we think about what does life perceive and how does it handle novelty, we can do

148
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,100
these kinds of experiments and find out that it's really much broader than the standard

149
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,060
reliability of development would lead us to believe.

150
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:53,940
So biology uses this multi-scale competency architecture where not only are we structurally

151
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:59,100
a nested set of nested dolls, but actually each of these layers solves problems in their

152
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,460
own spaces.

153
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:05,580
So these are transcriptional spaces, physiological spaces, and anatomical morpho space.

154
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,900
And when you're traversing, when you're some sort of a system that traverses these problem

155
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,620
spaces, we can ask with what level of competency.

156
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,500
And so we study different kinds of intelligence.

157
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,500
I like this due to William James, which is the ability to reach the same goal by different

158
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
means.

159
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:28,060
And then simply some sort of feed forward emergence where local rules give rise to some kind of

160
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,060
complexity.

161
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,180
There's potentially a whole other factor here.

162
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:40,740
And Wiener and colleagues produce this kind of cybernetic scale to express the different

163
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,220
kinds of competencies that you might have in navigating these sorts of spaces.

164
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:51,980
So we are all very good at, as most animals are, very good at noticing agency and intelligence

165
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,940
in the three-dimensional world.

166
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:59,900
All of our senses are primed for that to recognize medium-sized objects moving at medium speeds

167
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,380
and doing intelligent things.

168
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,940
But there are also some other spaces where we're really just beginning to understand

169
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,900
what intelligence looks like in these spaces.

170
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,100
And I only have time to talk about one, and this is my favorite one, anatomical morpho

171
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,300
space, which is the space of possible shapes that you can make out of cells.

172
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,460
So let's just ask a very basic question.

173
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,780
Where do anatomies come from?

174
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,620
This is a section through a human torso.

175
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,140
You can see the amazing order, the amazing invariant order of all this structure.

176
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,220
So where is it?

177
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,140
And you might be tempted to think it's in the DNA, but of course, we can read genomes

178
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,660
now and we know what's in the DNA, which is the instructions for micro-level hardware

179
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,580
of every cell, so the proteins.

180
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:43,940
We still need to understand how does the behavior of these cells give rise to something

181
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,940
like this?

182
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,260
How, if something is missing, we could cause these cells to rebuild?

183
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:54,420
So regenerative medicine in its engineers, and I'll show you at the end a synthetic organism.

184
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,540
What else can we make the exact same cells do?

185
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,200
So what is the plasticity here?

186
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,540
So one example of this kind of problem solving is something that we discovered a few years

187
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:08,180
ago, which is that when tadpoles turn into frogs, they have to rearrange their face.

188
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,940
So the eyes, the jaws, the nostrils, the mouth, everything has to move and you get from this

189
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,780
state to this state.

190
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,780
This was thought to be a hard-wired process.

191
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,380
Every organ just moves the right distance in the right direction and you get your frog.

192
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:26,740
We decided to test that hypothesis and ask actually how much competency is in this scheme.

193
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,100
And so we created so-called Picasso tadpoles.

194
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,100
Everything here is in the wrong place.

195
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:36,060
The eyes off to the side, the mouth is maybe on top of the head, everything is shifted.

196
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:40,660
And what you find is that remarkably, these animals tend to make pretty normal frogs because

197
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:46,300
all of this stuff will move around through abnormal paths and sometimes go too far and

198
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,460
actually have to come back until it gets to a correct frog face and then it stops.

199
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:55,340
So what the genetics actually gives you is a system that can do an error minimization

200
00:12:55,340 --> 00:13:00,860
scheme and it can navigate this morpho space and reach the correct goal from different

201
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,860
starting positions.

202
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,260
It doesn't just do the same thing every single time.

203
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:09,500
It actually is able to get around, for example, local maxima and things like that and get

204
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,940
to where it's going in morpho space.

205
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,940
Mammals do this too.

206
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,320
If you cut an early embryo in half, you don't get two half embryos.

207
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,340
You get two perfectly normal monosygotic twins.

208
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,820
My favorite example of this kind of thing is this.

209
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,340
This is very old work now.

210
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:29,940
This is a cross section through a kidney tubule in a salamander and you can see that basically

211
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:35,280
eight to 10 cells normally work together, cell to cell signaling, they make this lumen.

212
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:41,040
If you force the cells to be a larger size and you can do these tricks in this model,

213
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,560
then fewer cells will get together to give you the exact same size lumen.

214
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,160
That's pretty cool already, but the best part is, if you make the cells truly gigantic,

215
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:56,200
then one single cell will bend around itself and give you the exact same lumen.

216
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,040
Now, what's cool about that is this is a great example of top-down causation because this

217
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,240
is a completely different molecular mechanism.

218
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,640
This is cell-to-cell communication.

219
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,000
This is cytoskeletal bending.

220
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,160
In the service of a large-scale anatomical structure, meaning a particular location with

221
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:16,080
an anatomical morphospace, different molecular mechanisms get called up to enable the behavior

222
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,120
that gets you to the right place.

223
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,860
The microstates and the mechanisms are called up as needed to serve a large-scale sort of

224
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,800
executive kind of navigation policy in this space.

225
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,840
How could this possibly work?

226
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,080
Well, we have a precedent, of course.

227
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,400
The precedent is the brain and nervous system.

228
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:44,480
That's exactly what happens in neuroscience, which is that we have large-scale cognitive

229
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:52,440
goals, in that case in three-dimensional space, which what the nervous system does is transduce

230
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,280
that level of information processing down into the molecular steps that activate your

231
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,520
muscles and your glands and everything else.

232
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,480
You've got this hardware-software scheme where the output of these electrical networks drives

233
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,360
the movement of your body through three-dimensional space, and then you can do this neural decoding

234
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,600
kind of thing where, well, can we learn to read this information and make predictions

235
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
and so on?

236
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,480
But the super interesting thing is that actually this scheme is incredibly old.

237
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,440
It's way older than neurons and brains, evolutionarily.

238
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,640
Evolution discovered the benefits of electrical networks somewhere around the time of bacterial

239
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,640
biofilms.

240
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:37,200
Actually, it's very isomorphic to this system where prior to neurons and the nervous systems

241
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:44,120
and brains, what bioelectric networks through the rest of the body did was that they controlled

242
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,680
the movement of your body configuration through morpho space.

243
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,960
Very similar thing, except that what evolution did was pivot from one space into another,

244
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,720
and actually in many ways pivoted from control of spatial patterns to control of temporal

245
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,360
patterns in neural processing, but otherwise all the same tricks are usable and all the

246
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,880
same techniques are usable.

247
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,560
We developed some of the first tools to read and write electrical pattern memories in tissues

248
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,280
that were not neurons, but basically we took a lot from neuroscience, both conceptually

249
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,240
and practically.

250
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,920
We use optogenetics and active inference frameworks and all the same stuff.

251
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:31,000
This allows us to do things like this, to specifically try to learn to communicate different

252
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,320
morphological paths to groups of cells.

253
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,840
So frogs, unlike salamanders, do not regenerate their legs, and through asking what kind of

254
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:45,520
a signal would convince these cells to go down, build a leg trajectory versus the scar

255
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,280
and stop trajectory, we were able to come up with a very simple trigger, literally lasts

256
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:55,840
just one day, and what it does is it induces leg regeneration for over a year and a half.

257
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,760
We're not there 3D printing it, we're not there managing stem cells.

258
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,440
Our job is right at the beginning to convince this group of cells that what they're going

259
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,000
to be doing is embarking on this particular path through morpho space.

260
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,800
And so what happens is within 45 days you've got your regenerative genes, you've got your

261
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,640
toes, you've got a toenail, and eventually you get a pretty respectable looking leg that's

262
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,600
both touch sensitive and motile.

263
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,600
So and this, of course, we're now pushing this into rodents, I have to do a disclosure

264
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,560
here because Dave Kaplan and I are co-founders of this company that's going to try to move

265
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,920
this towards patients, but the idea here is to learn to communicate with this cellular

266
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,840
collective to understand what does it measure, what can it sense in morpho space, and what

267
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,800
are the efficient stimuli, the trigger points that can get it to make the decisions we want

268
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
to make.

269
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,200
So let me give you one particular example.

270
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,160
What you're seeing here is this is our method of visualizing bioelectrical gradients in

271
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,160
vivo.

272
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
So we call this the electric face.

273
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,880
This was first made by my colleague Danny Adams in our group.

274
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,520
And what you can see here is that before the genes come on to pattern the face and before

275
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,200
the anatomy, already you can see where everything is going to be.

276
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,040
Here's where the mouth is going to be, here's the eye, here are the placodes.

277
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,720
This is what you're seeing is resting potential.

278
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,440
This is a dye that reports resting potential.

279
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:19,680
Even before we had seen this pattern, we had asked this simple question, could we reproduce

280
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,040
these kinds of patterns elsewhere in the body and convince cells to build a completely

281
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,040
different organ?

282
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,240
So here, this is an early experiment by my grad student, Sherry Owl.

283
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:35,640
And what she did was inject potassium channel RNA into specific cells to induce this kind

284
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,320
of bioelectrical state.

285
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,760
And sure enough, you can make an eye anywhere.

286
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,760
In fact, outside of the region that's normally thought to be the only one competent to make

287
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,080
eyes, you can do this anywhere.

288
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,760
You can do it on the tail and the gut, anywhere you want.

289
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,320
And of course, we're not providing enough information to specify an eye.

290
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,400
These eyes have lens and retina and optic nerve and all that kind of stuff.

291
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,800
We don't have to specify any of that.

292
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,520
What we have to do is give the collective here a pattern that basically, it's a subroutine

293
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,520
call.

294
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,240
It's a pattern that says build an eye here.

295
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,600
And there are other patterns for hearts and legs and brains and various other things.

296
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:14,640
And one of the cool, so that's kind of neat, but one of the cool competencies here is this.

297
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,800
This is a lens sitting out in the flank of a tail somewhere.

298
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:23,280
What you'll notice is that the blue cells, so these are marked by a genetic tracer.

299
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,320
The blue cells are the ones that have our ion channel.

300
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,000
These are all wild type cells.

301
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,820
What happens here is two levels of instruction.

302
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,840
We instruct these cells, you need to make an eye.

303
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,600
They can somehow perceive that there's not enough of them to do the job and they end

304
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,840
up communicating and recruiting their neighbors.

305
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,360
So these are the perfectly normal wild type neighbors that get pulled away from their

306
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,520
task of making skin and muscle and various other things and induce now into this eye

307
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,840
building project of exactly the right shape and size.

308
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:58,280
It's possibly parallels with recruitment in insect swarms and ants and termites and things

309
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,780
like that.

310
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:04,920
So there's some really interesting dynamics and decision making here that's multi-level.

311
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,520
The other example that I just wanted to show you was planaria.

312
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,440
So these are our flatworms.

313
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,840
I told you they're extremely reliable, but one thing that we want to do if we believe

314
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:21,000
that the morphogenetic process involves a collective intelligence of these cells building

315
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,920
things, we want to be able to read and write the memories of this collective intelligence.

316
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:31,480
And so we characterized the electric circuit that determines head number because once you

317
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,560
cut off the head and the tail, this middle fragment has to decide how many heads should

318
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,720
a proper planarian have, one, two, zero, maybe more.

319
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,160
And so what we were able to do is this, by reading the electrical pattern, this is the

320
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,960
electrical pattern that says one head, one tail, we can change that pattern.

321
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,200
This is done with ion channel drugs, no electric fields, no electrodes.

322
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,520
This is manipulating the native interface that these cells are exposing.

323
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,760
And so what you get is you can say two heads here if it's kind of messy, still the technology

324
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,080
is being worked out.

325
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,480
And what this fragment will then do is build a two-headed animal.

326
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,080
This is not Photoshop, these are real two-headed animals.

327
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,200
And here's the most important part.

328
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,440
This electrical map is not a map of this creature down here.

329
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,760
This electrical map is a map of this guy who will not do anything different, still one

330
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,680
head, one tail, normal gene expression.

331
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,900
But if you injure him, if you cut the head and tail, this is the memory that these cells

332
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,480
will use to determine what a correct planarian looks like and then they will build.

333
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,880
It's a counterfactual memory.

334
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,760
It's a representation of something that might be true later.

335
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,240
It's definitely not true now.

336
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,440
And it's a kind of a latent memory.

337
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,280
And so the planarian body can hold one of two different, probably a lot more, but we

338
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:47,200
found two different representations of what a normal planarian looks like and we can rewrite

339
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,700
it at will.

340
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,480
Here they are, these two-headed worms.

341
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,680
The reason I call this a memory is because if you take these two-headed worms and cut

342
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,840
them again in plain water, no more manipulation, they continue to regenerate to the new shape.

343
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,920
So it's got all the properties of memory.

344
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,640
It's long-term stable, but it's rewriteable.

345
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,680
It has conditional recall, which I just showed you, and there are discrete possible behaviors.

346
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,560
So the question of how many heads should a planarian have is actually, it's a subtle,

347
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,560
where is that information?

348
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,660
Well, it's not in the genome.

349
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:21,760
What the genome gives you is a piece of electrical hardware that, by default, reliably generates

350
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,720
the memory for one head, but it doesn't have to be that way.

351
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,360
And the very last thing I want to show you, and then I'll stop, is this synthetic kind

352
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:35,480
of project, where we really want to understand where do these morphogenetic goals come from?

353
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,320
The standard answer is evolution, but we want to see, and again, this is work with Joshua

354
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:47,240
Bongard, Doug Blackiston did all the biology, Sam Kriegman did the programming, and this

355
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,640
is in our ICDO Institute.

356
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,320
So what we wanted to do was to ask a question about plasticity of these cells.

357
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,800
So we took a frog embryo, Xenopus lavis, Doug collected some of these skin cells from

358
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:06,920
the animal cap, dissociated them, let them re-associate in a little pile here.

359
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,920
What could they do?

360
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,920
Well, they could die.

361
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,560
They could spread out and go away from each other.

362
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,640
They could form a two-dimensional monolayer.

363
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:19,880
Instead, what they do is, overnight, they coalesce like this, and they make this little

364
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:25,240
thing we call a Xenobot for Xenopus lavis and Biobot.

365
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,600
So you can see what it's doing, it moves, because it has little cilia, normally these

366
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,480
are used to redistribute mucus on the surface of the frog, but this thing can use them to

367
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,480
move around.

368
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,480
They can go in circles.

369
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,880
They can patrol back and forth.

370
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,240
They can have collective behaviors, all sorts of different behaviors.

371
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,200
Here's what they look like navigating a maze.

372
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,920
So here it is.

373
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,440
It's going to take this turn here without actually bumping into the opposite wall, so

374
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,440
he takes the turn.

375
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,320
And then at this point, for some reason, we don't know why it decides to turn around

376
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,320
and go back where it came from.

377
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,320
They have a wide variety of behaviors.

378
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,320
You can do calcium imaging.

379
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:04,960
They have a very rich set of signals, and we can start to use all the tools from behavioral

380
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,680
neuroscience to ask what kind of information integration is happening.

381
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,120
Are they actually communicating?

382
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,040
Is there mutual information?

383
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,040
Stay tuned for that.

384
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,520
But remember, there are no neurons here.

385
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,680
This is just skin.

386
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,960
And so this is what skin does when left to its own devices.

387
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,840
Here's one last thing that it does.

388
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:28,080
If you give these guys loose materials, so these are just loose skin cells sitting out.

389
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,680
We'll just sprinkle them.

390
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:35,040
What we find is that these xenobots, their motion is able to corral these cells into

391
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:40,080
little piles, and then they continue to polish these little piles and sort of push them together.

392
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,560
And because they're working with an agential material, these are not passive particles.

393
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,760
These are cells.

394
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:50,360
And so we as engineers, evolution, and xenobots are all working in this agential material.

395
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,280
So what they do is they make these little piles, the little piles mature, and become

396
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,680
the next generation of xenobots.

397
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,680
Well, what do they do?

398
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,880
They run around and do exactly the same thing, and now you've got the next generation and

399
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,880
the one after that.

400
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,240
It's sort of von Neumann's dream of a robot making copies of itself from materials at

401
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,240
fine.

402
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,640
So we call this kinematic replication.

403
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,360
And so the last thing I just want to point out is this.

404
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,440
This is the genome of Xenopus lavas.

405
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,440
That's what's in these cells.

406
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,080
We didn't add any genes.

407
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,320
There are no synthetic circuits.

408
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,920
There are no nanomaterials.

409
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,880
So now the question is, what does the genome actually specify?

410
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,920
Well, under default conditions, it specifies this developmental sequence and some tadpole

411
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,920
behavior.

412
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,760
But actually, if you engineer by subtraction, if you take away the influence of a whole

413
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,480
bunch of cells, you get to find out what the skin cell really wants to be doing.

414
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,640
The normal sort of boring two-dimensional life that it has on the outside of the organism

415
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,200
is what it does when it's behavior-shaped by the other cells.

416
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,320
Move that, and you find out what the default behavior is.

417
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,720
The default behavior is this.

418
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,200
Xenobot, a weird developmental sequence, a few weeks later, it turns into this.

419
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,000
We have no idea what this is, completely new.

420
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,200
And then they have this kinematic cell for application behavior.

421
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,160
So unlike all the other creatures we all study, they have no straightforward evolutionary

422
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,160
backstory.

423
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,360
There's never been selection to be a good Xenobot.

424
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,280
Of course, the frog cells were selected.

425
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,920
But they have novel morphological and behavioral outcomes that don't have a straightforward

426
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,960
story.

427
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,880
And we're still working to understand what the cognitive capacities are.

428
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:27,320
So I'll just end by saying that because biology, as I showed you in the kidney tubule example

429
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:33,160
and others, the embryo really doesn't have firm expectations or assumptions about what's

430
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,160
going to happen.

431
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,440
You don't know how many cells you're going to have.

432
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,400
You don't know what size your cells are going to be.

433
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,680
You don't know what your genetics are going to be like.

434
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,760
And evolution makes these amazing problem-solving machines that will do something adaptive in

435
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,760
a wide range of circumstances.

436
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,120
And that means that almost any combination of evolved material, designed material, and

437
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,840
software is some kind of agent.

438
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:02,200
So you've got cyborgs and hybrids and all kinds of synthetic beings.

439
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,640
Everything that Darwin was talking about when he said endless forms most beautiful is a

440
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,080
tiny corner of this enormous option space of beings.

441
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,120
And what that means is that in the future, when we're surrounded by these things, and

442
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:18,640
I firmly believe that we will be, the old criteria by which we decided how we relate

443
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,200
to something, which is what are you made of and how did you get here, meaning evolved

444
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,360
or designed, those criteria are not going to survive the next decade or two.

445
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,760
We need a completely different basis for ethics to learn to relate to organisms that are very

446
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,120
different from us.

447
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,720
So I will just end here, because I'm already running out of time, just to thank all the

448
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:45,320
post-docs and students who did this work, our funders, the animals who do all the heavy

449
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:51,520
lifting in this kind of work, and the two disclosures for commercial relationships.

450
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,520
So thank you very much.

451
00:27:54,520 --> 00:28:02,440
Thank you very much for this very interesting talk, Michael, can you hear me?

452
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,440
Yep.

453
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,440
Great.

454
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,080
So I will be conveying the questions that the audience has, and I would like to ask

455
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:13,240
the audience to keep them short and simple, we have time maybe for two questions, and

456
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,240
I cannot see hands.

457
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:21,680
Are there two hands maybe there?

458
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:31,400
Hello, thank you very much for a very interesting talk.

459
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:38,520
I just have one little point to make, and that is to do with your very first slide.

460
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:46,440
You said that to begin with, it's all physics, and thereafter processes take place, biological

461
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,200
processes.

462
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,160
The point is that life comes from life.

463
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:57,800
There were two living organisms, certainly in terms of sperm and egg.

464
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,880
So it's not a case of just physics.

465
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,440
I wonder what you have to say about that.

466
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,760
So can you hear the questions?

467
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,920
No, I apologize, I couldn't hear any of them.

468
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,600
So it goes back to your first slide that you said the first there was physics, and then

469
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,960
biology kind of kicks in, and the comment is like everything in life starts from life,

470
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:21,280
so from the egg, and what do you think the role, like would you like to comment on that?

471
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,680
What do you mean by everything starts with physics?

472
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,680
Yeah.

473
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:33,040
So, of course, the line between living and non-living is not a sharp line.

474
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:38,200
There are many people doing some very interesting work on really minimal systems that have important

475
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:43,640
aspects of self-organization and problem solving that you probably wouldn't call alive.

476
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,560
Honestly, I don't spend very much time trying to get a definition of life.

477
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,280
I know other people do, and I'm not an expert on that.

478
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,760
To me, the spectrum of intelligence, including very, very basal examples that you wouldn't

479
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:06,800
call alive, I think that spectrum is more interesting than the live-not-live kind of

480
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
a distinction.

481
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,880
And I think that there are many things that are going to have degrees, including very

482
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,760
basic things, but also more complex things, that we should be considering as important

483
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,640
intelligent agents that do not overlap with the set of living agents, and I think that's

484
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,240
the more important criterion.

485
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,240
Thank you.

486
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,440
Is there a second one?

487
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,440
Short, please.

488
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,440
There are a couple of hands here.

489
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,800
Just a question about the idea of self-replication.

490
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:50,600
In this example, it seemed that the cells needed to be provided to create what could

491
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:56,680
be otherwise interpreted as maybe an incidental self-replication, whereas I imagine in most

492
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:02,000
other systems that are considered self-replicating, the materials for that replication must also

493
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
be acquired.

494
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,400
So I just wonder if you can comment on this distinction between materials being provided

495
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,520
and materials being acquired.

496
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,040
So the question is about self-replication in the examples that you showed, and whether

497
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:21,240
the materials need to be provided or acquired, and what do we actually mean in the end by

498
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,240
self-replication?

499
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,520
Yeah, well, great question.

500
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:31,200
I think like with everything else that I've been talking about, self-replication is a

501
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,200
continuum.

502
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,200
So this is an extremely minimal self-replicating system.

503
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:41,360
It is not a full kind of, you wouldn't call this a full replicating organism, for example.

504
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,520
It does not have strong heredity, so all of the bots that are made don't bear more resemblance

505
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,800
to their parents than they do to random members of the population.

506
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,360
So there's not that element of strong heredity here.

507
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,360
You're absolutely right.

508
00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:01,240
The cells, the material must be provided by us, so these bots will not go out and bite

509
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:06,360
little cells off of some other source to release them, although they could be made to do so,

510
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,000
and if they were evolvable, maybe at some point they would do that.

511
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,160
As far as I know, no other creature on Earth does this kind of kinematic replication.

512
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:19,520
So we see this as a very minimal kind of example along the continuum of self-replication that

513
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:25,120
starts with nothing and ends with a full kind of completely autonomous replication cycle

514
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,080
that some advanced life forms are able to do.

515
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,040
So this is somewhere in between, and for sure they must be provided with these cells.

516
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,000
They will not acquire these cells by themselves.

517
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Great.

518
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Thank you very much.

519
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,840
Michael, and at this point we can move on to our next speaker, so thank you once again

520
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,840
for being with us.

521
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,840
I'll make virtually.

522
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,840
Thank you very much.

523
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,840
Thank you very much.

524
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,840
Thank you very much.

525
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,840
Thank you very much.

526
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,840
Thank you very much.

527
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,840
Thank you very much.

528
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,340
Thank you very much.
