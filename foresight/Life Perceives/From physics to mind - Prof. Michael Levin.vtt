WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.720
It is a great honor to be introducing, albeit virtually, the holder of the Vannevar Busch

00:05.720 --> 00:10.400
endow chair and a distinguished professor in the biology department at Tufts, Professor

00:10.400 --> 00:12.200
Michael Levin.

00:12.200 --> 00:15.680
Director of the Island Discovery Center at Tufts, as well as the Tufts Center for Regenerative

00:15.680 --> 00:21.960
and Developmental Biology, Michael studies the bioelectrical codes that cells use during

00:21.960 --> 00:28.200
the development, injury or regeneration of an organism, and deciphering these codes,

00:28.680 --> 00:34.080
cellular language gives you access to the messages these cells exchange with each other.

00:34.080 --> 00:39.520
So if you can start speaking it, you can make repurposing suggestions, you can instruct

00:39.520 --> 00:42.520
the cellular decisions.

00:42.520 --> 00:48.960
It is probably impossible to summarize neatly the work that Michael Levin has done.

00:48.960 --> 00:54.240
He's working at the, like his work actually is the epitome between computer science and

00:54.240 --> 01:01.160
biology, and I will just mention two of his projects, Xenobots, and distinguishing left

01:01.160 --> 01:06.320
from right, and I will leave the stage to him for his talk from physics to mind, the

01:06.320 --> 01:10.320
journey of cognition seen through the lens of embryonic development.

01:10.320 --> 01:18.320
Thank you so much, let's see, here we go, hopefully you can see my slides.

01:18.400 --> 01:22.400
Thank you for, let's start from the beginning.

01:22.400 --> 01:27.400
Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to share some ideas with you at this amazing

01:27.400 --> 01:30.400
workshop.

01:30.400 --> 01:36.400
Anyone who's interested can contact me or get any of the primary data sets, the software,

01:36.400 --> 01:40.400
all the details, all the protocols, everything else you can get here.

01:40.400 --> 01:44.400
What I thought I would try to do is give you an overview of some of the ideas that we've

01:44.480 --> 01:48.480
been working on and some of their practical implications.

01:48.480 --> 01:54.480
So one of the kind of key things to think about is that many people, when they think

01:54.480 --> 01:59.480
about a cognition, they think about a human, and we all think we know what a human is.

01:59.480 --> 02:04.480
But as Cyril says, sometimes we have to look a little closer at these ideas.

02:04.480 --> 02:11.480
And the fact is that all of us began life as just physics, that is, we were all a quiescent

02:11.560 --> 02:15.560
oocyte at one point, a little blob of chemicals, and that one might look and might say, well,

02:15.560 --> 02:19.560
that's just chemistry, there's no cognition or decision making there.

02:19.560 --> 02:25.560
But eventually this becomes, through an extremely slow and gradual process, step by step, this

02:25.560 --> 02:30.560
becomes one of these complex creatures, including perhaps one with metacognition that makes

02:30.560 --> 02:36.560
claims about anthropomorphisms and being different from other types of physical objects

02:36.560 --> 02:37.560
and so on.

02:37.640 --> 02:42.640
And so it's really important to ask ourselves, how is it that we make this journey across

02:42.640 --> 02:43.640
the Cartesian cut?

02:43.640 --> 02:46.640
How do we get from here to here?

02:46.640 --> 02:51.640
Now, Alan Turing needs no introduction, and he was very interested in unconventional

02:51.640 --> 02:57.640
embodiments of mind, he wanted to know what intelligence was as abstracted from current

02:57.640 --> 03:01.640
implementations in the natural world.

03:01.720 --> 03:07.720
But interestingly enough, he also wrote a paper on morphogenesis, on the creation of

03:07.720 --> 03:09.720
shape in chemical systems.

03:09.720 --> 03:14.720
And you might wonder, why would somebody who's interested in intelligence and computation

03:14.720 --> 03:17.720
be interested in developmental biology in that way?

03:17.720 --> 03:22.720
And I think that this is yet another facet of his brilliance in that he saw, I think,

03:22.720 --> 03:27.720
a deep truth, which is that these two questions are fundamentally the same question, the question

03:27.800 --> 03:33.800
of intelligence, unified intelligence in the mind and the self-assembly of the body are

03:36.800 --> 03:38.800
fundamentally the same question.

03:38.800 --> 03:42.800
And this is a perspective from which we do a lot of our work.

03:42.800 --> 03:46.800
So one thing that people will often say is that things like ant colonies and flocks of

03:46.800 --> 03:51.800
birds and so on, our collective intelligence is maybe, and we can sort of argue about whether

03:51.800 --> 03:55.800
it makes sense for any given collective to call it a collective intelligence.

03:55.880 --> 03:58.880
But then we think, well, we are not like that.

03:58.880 --> 04:01.880
We are not like a flock of birds or a collection of ants.

04:01.880 --> 04:04.880
We have our true unified intelligence.

04:04.880 --> 04:10.880
But I think we need to be very clear that this is just a matter of scale and a particular

04:10.880 --> 04:12.880
lens that we use to view ourselves.

04:12.880 --> 04:17.880
If you actually dig in, what you find out that we are all made of parts, in fact, I

04:17.880 --> 04:20.880
would say that all intelligences are collective intelligences.

04:20.880 --> 04:22.880
We are all made of parts.

04:22.960 --> 04:27.960
So inside of our supposedly unified brain and inside the pineal gland that Descartes

04:27.960 --> 04:30.960
thought was very important because there was just one of them.

04:30.960 --> 04:32.960
Sure, there's just one of them.

04:32.960 --> 04:33.960
But if you look in, what do you see?

04:33.960 --> 04:34.960
You see cells.

04:34.960 --> 04:39.960
And inside of these cells, you see this unbelievably rich mosaic of functional systems that are

04:39.960 --> 04:41.960
doing all kinds of stuff.

04:41.960 --> 04:44.960
This is what's inside every single cell of your body.

04:44.960 --> 04:49.960
So we are all collective intelligences and we are made of something that looks a little

04:49.960 --> 04:50.960
bit like this.

04:51.040 --> 04:55.040
This is a free living organism known as the lacrimaria.

04:55.040 --> 04:56.040
There is no brain.

04:56.040 --> 04:57.040
There's no nervous system.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.040
But you can see what's going on here.

04:59.040 --> 05:05.040
This creature is incredibly competent in handling its small scale goals, so single cell level

05:05.040 --> 05:11.040
goals, such as physiological goals, anatomical goals and metabolic goals.

05:11.040 --> 05:16.040
And if you're into soft robotics or something like that, you'd be very jealous of this.

05:16.040 --> 05:20.040
We don't really have anything that has this incredible level of control.

05:20.120 --> 05:27.120
And we are, in fact, made of diverse cells with all kinds of competencies such as these

05:27.120 --> 05:32.120
that work together on very large projects, whereas individual cells work on single level

05:32.120 --> 05:35.120
cell goals, such as proliferation and metabolic states.

05:35.120 --> 05:39.380
What I'm going to show you is that collections of cells can work on very large goals, such

05:39.380 --> 05:41.180
as making things like this.

05:41.180 --> 05:46.120
So let's think about what this kind of architecture, this is a very unique architecture, what does

05:46.120 --> 05:47.120
allow us to do?

05:47.200 --> 05:51.400
Well, for example, it raises some profound questions.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.480
So here's a caterpillar.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.320
This is a soft-bodied creature.

05:54.320 --> 05:58.400
It has a brain suitable for crawling around on leaves and eating leaves.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.280
So it sort of lives in a two-dimensional world.

06:01.280 --> 06:05.120
It has to turn into this, which is a butterfly, which lives in a three-dimensional world.

06:05.120 --> 06:10.200
It's a hard-bodied kind of creature, completely different controller needed to drive this than

06:10.200 --> 06:11.200
to drive this.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.560
It has a different brain.

06:12.560 --> 06:15.700
During this process, the brain is largely taken apart.

06:15.700 --> 06:19.100
Many of the cells die, most of the connections are taken apart.

06:19.100 --> 06:23.700
But one of the amazing things is that there are data that show that memories persist.

06:23.700 --> 06:27.300
So if you teach something to a caterpillar, the moth or a butterfly actually retains the

06:27.300 --> 06:33.380
information despite this incredible rearrangement of the cognitive medium here.

06:33.380 --> 06:37.060
So you can ask some very basic questions.

06:37.060 --> 06:40.660
We've thought about this issue of what's it like to be a butterfly, but moreover, what's

06:40.660 --> 06:44.380
it like to be a caterpillar changing into a butterfly?

06:45.220 --> 06:52.500
You are an agent and during your lifetime, your mind, your body completely rearranged,

06:52.500 --> 06:54.180
but some of the memories remain.

06:54.180 --> 06:57.700
This is even taken even further by this model system.

06:57.700 --> 06:58.700
These are planaria.

06:58.700 --> 07:00.060
These are flatworms.

07:00.060 --> 07:04.100
And the thing about flatworms is that they are incredibly regenerative.

07:04.100 --> 07:06.580
So every part of the body can be regenerated.

07:06.580 --> 07:09.860
So pieces regrow a whole new head with a brain and everything.

07:09.860 --> 07:15.980
And what McConnell found in the 1960s, and we have since replicated using modern automated

07:15.980 --> 07:20.580
equipment that we've made, is this amazing fact that if you take a planarian and you

07:20.580 --> 07:28.340
train them on a specific task, so to look for food in these little bumpy kinds of regions,

07:28.340 --> 07:30.900
then what you can do is you can amputate the entire head.

07:30.900 --> 07:34.100
The tail will sit there doing nothing for about eight to 10 days.

07:34.100 --> 07:37.660
Then eventually they regrow a new brain, behavior begins.

07:37.660 --> 07:41.060
And then you find out that actually during this time, what had happened was information

07:41.060 --> 07:46.100
that was stored in the rest of the body was somehow imprinted onto this new brain.

07:46.100 --> 07:49.620
Not only is information stored outside the brain, and they have a true centralized brain

07:49.620 --> 07:56.420
that would just like we do, they're not like a distributed starfish or anything.

07:56.420 --> 08:01.460
Not only can information be stored outside of the brain, but actually can be moved through

08:01.460 --> 08:05.180
the body and can be imprinted onto a brand new fresh brain.

08:05.180 --> 08:10.540
And so then you can sort of ask philosophical questions like that, the malfunctioning transporter

08:10.540 --> 08:11.540
experiment.

08:11.540 --> 08:15.820
What happens if somebody makes a copy of you and forgets to destroy the original?

08:15.820 --> 08:17.140
This actually happens in planaria.

08:17.140 --> 08:23.540
You can cut this thing into pieces, and every piece is in an important way, both in physical

08:23.540 --> 08:27.260
and somatic and cognitive continuity with the original.

08:27.260 --> 08:32.620
So you can see there's this biology has this amazing plasticity and also this relationship

08:32.620 --> 08:36.300
between behavioral memories and anatomical memories.

08:36.300 --> 08:41.140
And when we'll talk more about this, that plasticity extends to vertebrates.

08:41.140 --> 08:45.020
So what we've done here is, this is the work of Doug Blackistan in our group.

08:45.020 --> 08:47.660
This is a tappel of the frog Xenopus lavas.

08:47.660 --> 08:48.660
Here are the nostrils.

08:48.660 --> 08:49.660
Here's the mouth.

08:49.660 --> 08:50.660
Here's the brain.

08:50.660 --> 08:51.900
And you'll notice there are no eyes up here.

08:51.900 --> 08:55.700
We prevented these eyes from forming, but we did put an eye on the tail.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.860
And I'll show you in a few minutes how we do that.

08:57.860 --> 09:01.780
What we find out is that when you make animals like this and you test them using this behavior

09:01.780 --> 09:06.340
testing apparatus that we built, it's an automated training and testing device, what

09:06.340 --> 09:09.260
you find is that these animals can see quite well.

09:09.260 --> 09:13.260
And in fact, these eyes form, even though they're sitting in the middle of muscle instead

09:13.260 --> 09:16.380
of in their normal position in the brain, they make an optic nerve.

09:16.380 --> 09:19.940
The optic nerve does not connect to the brain, at best it connects to the spinal cord right

09:19.940 --> 09:20.940
here.

09:20.940 --> 09:27.340
And without eons of evolutionary adaptation, without any of that, immediately out of the

09:27.340 --> 09:33.340
box, these animals can see with this radically different sensory architecture.

09:33.340 --> 09:38.300
So as we think about what does life perceive and how does it handle novelty, we can do

09:38.300 --> 09:43.100
these kinds of experiments and find out that it's really much broader than the standard

09:43.100 --> 09:47.060
reliability of development would lead us to believe.

09:47.060 --> 09:53.940
So biology uses this multi-scale competency architecture where not only are we structurally

09:53.940 --> 09:59.100
a nested set of nested dolls, but actually each of these layers solves problems in their

09:59.100 --> 10:00.460
own spaces.

10:00.460 --> 10:05.580
So these are transcriptional spaces, physiological spaces, and anatomical morpho space.

10:05.580 --> 10:08.900
And when you're traversing, when you're some sort of a system that traverses these problem

10:08.900 --> 10:12.620
spaces, we can ask with what level of competency.

10:12.620 --> 10:16.500
And so we study different kinds of intelligence.

10:16.500 --> 10:21.500
I like this due to William James, which is the ability to reach the same goal by different

10:21.500 --> 10:22.500
means.

10:22.500 --> 10:28.060
And then simply some sort of feed forward emergence where local rules give rise to some kind of

10:28.060 --> 10:29.060
complexity.

10:29.060 --> 10:32.180
There's potentially a whole other factor here.

10:32.180 --> 10:40.740
And Wiener and colleagues produce this kind of cybernetic scale to express the different

10:40.740 --> 10:45.220
kinds of competencies that you might have in navigating these sorts of spaces.

10:45.220 --> 10:51.980
So we are all very good at, as most animals are, very good at noticing agency and intelligence

10:51.980 --> 10:53.940
in the three-dimensional world.

10:53.940 --> 10:59.900
All of our senses are primed for that to recognize medium-sized objects moving at medium speeds

10:59.900 --> 11:01.380
and doing intelligent things.

11:01.380 --> 11:04.940
But there are also some other spaces where we're really just beginning to understand

11:04.940 --> 11:06.900
what intelligence looks like in these spaces.

11:06.900 --> 11:11.100
And I only have time to talk about one, and this is my favorite one, anatomical morpho

11:11.100 --> 11:15.300
space, which is the space of possible shapes that you can make out of cells.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.460
So let's just ask a very basic question.

11:17.460 --> 11:18.780
Where do anatomies come from?

11:18.780 --> 11:22.620
This is a section through a human torso.

11:22.620 --> 11:27.140
You can see the amazing order, the amazing invariant order of all this structure.

11:27.140 --> 11:28.220
So where is it?

11:28.220 --> 11:32.140
And you might be tempted to think it's in the DNA, but of course, we can read genomes

11:32.140 --> 11:36.660
now and we know what's in the DNA, which is the instructions for micro-level hardware

11:36.660 --> 11:38.580
of every cell, so the proteins.

11:38.580 --> 11:43.940
We still need to understand how does the behavior of these cells give rise to something

11:43.940 --> 11:44.940
like this?

11:44.940 --> 11:48.260
How, if something is missing, we could cause these cells to rebuild?

11:48.260 --> 11:54.420
So regenerative medicine in its engineers, and I'll show you at the end a synthetic organism.

11:54.420 --> 11:57.540
What else can we make the exact same cells do?

11:57.540 --> 11:59.200
So what is the plasticity here?

11:59.200 --> 12:02.540
So one example of this kind of problem solving is something that we discovered a few years

12:02.540 --> 12:08.180
ago, which is that when tadpoles turn into frogs, they have to rearrange their face.

12:08.180 --> 12:11.940
So the eyes, the jaws, the nostrils, the mouth, everything has to move and you get from this

12:11.940 --> 12:13.780
state to this state.

12:13.780 --> 12:15.780
This was thought to be a hard-wired process.

12:15.780 --> 12:20.380
Every organ just moves the right distance in the right direction and you get your frog.

12:20.380 --> 12:26.740
We decided to test that hypothesis and ask actually how much competency is in this scheme.

12:26.740 --> 12:30.100
And so we created so-called Picasso tadpoles.

12:30.100 --> 12:31.100
Everything here is in the wrong place.

12:31.100 --> 12:36.060
The eyes off to the side, the mouth is maybe on top of the head, everything is shifted.

12:36.060 --> 12:40.660
And what you find is that remarkably, these animals tend to make pretty normal frogs because

12:40.660 --> 12:46.300
all of this stuff will move around through abnormal paths and sometimes go too far and

12:46.300 --> 12:50.460
actually have to come back until it gets to a correct frog face and then it stops.

12:50.460 --> 12:55.340
So what the genetics actually gives you is a system that can do an error minimization

12:55.340 --> 13:00.860
scheme and it can navigate this morpho space and reach the correct goal from different

13:00.860 --> 13:01.860
starting positions.

13:01.860 --> 13:04.260
It doesn't just do the same thing every single time.

13:04.260 --> 13:09.500
It actually is able to get around, for example, local maxima and things like that and get

13:09.500 --> 13:11.940
to where it's going in morpho space.

13:11.940 --> 13:12.940
Mammals do this too.

13:12.940 --> 13:16.320
If you cut an early embryo in half, you don't get two half embryos.

13:16.320 --> 13:19.340
You get two perfectly normal monosygotic twins.

13:19.340 --> 13:22.820
My favorite example of this kind of thing is this.

13:22.820 --> 13:24.340
This is very old work now.

13:24.340 --> 13:29.940
This is a cross section through a kidney tubule in a salamander and you can see that basically

13:29.940 --> 13:35.280
eight to 10 cells normally work together, cell to cell signaling, they make this lumen.

13:35.280 --> 13:41.040
If you force the cells to be a larger size and you can do these tricks in this model,

13:41.040 --> 13:45.560
then fewer cells will get together to give you the exact same size lumen.

13:45.560 --> 13:50.160
That's pretty cool already, but the best part is, if you make the cells truly gigantic,

13:50.160 --> 13:56.200
then one single cell will bend around itself and give you the exact same lumen.

13:56.200 --> 14:00.040
Now, what's cool about that is this is a great example of top-down causation because this

14:00.040 --> 14:02.240
is a completely different molecular mechanism.

14:02.240 --> 14:03.640
This is cell-to-cell communication.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.000
This is cytoskeletal bending.

14:05.520 --> 14:10.160
In the service of a large-scale anatomical structure, meaning a particular location with

14:10.160 --> 14:16.080
an anatomical morphospace, different molecular mechanisms get called up to enable the behavior

14:16.080 --> 14:20.120
that gets you to the right place.

14:20.120 --> 14:24.860
The microstates and the mechanisms are called up as needed to serve a large-scale sort of

14:24.860 --> 14:29.800
executive kind of navigation policy in this space.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.840
How could this possibly work?

14:31.840 --> 14:34.080
Well, we have a precedent, of course.

14:34.080 --> 14:37.400
The precedent is the brain and nervous system.

14:37.400 --> 14:44.480
That's exactly what happens in neuroscience, which is that we have large-scale cognitive

14:44.480 --> 14:52.440
goals, in that case in three-dimensional space, which what the nervous system does is transduce

14:52.440 --> 14:57.280
that level of information processing down into the molecular steps that activate your

14:57.280 --> 15:01.520
muscles and your glands and everything else.

15:01.560 --> 15:06.480
You've got this hardware-software scheme where the output of these electrical networks drives

15:06.480 --> 15:11.360
the movement of your body through three-dimensional space, and then you can do this neural decoding

15:11.360 --> 15:14.600
kind of thing where, well, can we learn to read this information and make predictions

15:14.600 --> 15:15.600
and so on?

15:15.600 --> 15:20.480
But the super interesting thing is that actually this scheme is incredibly old.

15:20.480 --> 15:24.440
It's way older than neurons and brains, evolutionarily.

15:24.440 --> 15:28.640
Evolution discovered the benefits of electrical networks somewhere around the time of bacterial

15:28.640 --> 15:29.640
biofilms.

15:29.760 --> 15:37.200
Actually, it's very isomorphic to this system where prior to neurons and the nervous systems

15:37.200 --> 15:44.120
and brains, what bioelectric networks through the rest of the body did was that they controlled

15:44.120 --> 15:49.680
the movement of your body configuration through morpho space.

15:49.680 --> 15:53.960
Very similar thing, except that what evolution did was pivot from one space into another,

15:53.960 --> 15:58.720
and actually in many ways pivoted from control of spatial patterns to control of temporal

15:58.720 --> 16:04.360
patterns in neural processing, but otherwise all the same tricks are usable and all the

16:04.360 --> 16:06.880
same techniques are usable.

16:06.880 --> 16:12.560
We developed some of the first tools to read and write electrical pattern memories in tissues

16:12.560 --> 16:17.280
that were not neurons, but basically we took a lot from neuroscience, both conceptually

16:17.280 --> 16:19.240
and practically.

16:19.240 --> 16:24.920
We use optogenetics and active inference frameworks and all the same stuff.

16:24.920 --> 16:31.000
This allows us to do things like this, to specifically try to learn to communicate different

16:31.000 --> 16:34.320
morphological paths to groups of cells.

16:34.320 --> 16:38.840
So frogs, unlike salamanders, do not regenerate their legs, and through asking what kind of

16:38.840 --> 16:45.520
a signal would convince these cells to go down, build a leg trajectory versus the scar

16:45.520 --> 16:50.280
and stop trajectory, we were able to come up with a very simple trigger, literally lasts

16:50.280 --> 16:55.840
just one day, and what it does is it induces leg regeneration for over a year and a half.

16:55.840 --> 16:59.760
We're not there 3D printing it, we're not there managing stem cells.

16:59.760 --> 17:03.440
Our job is right at the beginning to convince this group of cells that what they're going

17:03.440 --> 17:07.000
to be doing is embarking on this particular path through morpho space.

17:07.000 --> 17:12.800
And so what happens is within 45 days you've got your regenerative genes, you've got your

17:12.800 --> 17:17.640
toes, you've got a toenail, and eventually you get a pretty respectable looking leg that's

17:17.640 --> 17:20.600
both touch sensitive and motile.

17:20.600 --> 17:24.600
So and this, of course, we're now pushing this into rodents, I have to do a disclosure

17:24.600 --> 17:29.560
here because Dave Kaplan and I are co-founders of this company that's going to try to move

17:29.560 --> 17:33.920
this towards patients, but the idea here is to learn to communicate with this cellular

17:33.920 --> 17:38.840
collective to understand what does it measure, what can it sense in morpho space, and what

17:38.840 --> 17:43.800
are the efficient stimuli, the trigger points that can get it to make the decisions we want

17:43.800 --> 17:44.800
to make.

17:44.800 --> 17:47.200
So let me give you one particular example.

17:47.200 --> 17:52.160
What you're seeing here is this is our method of visualizing bioelectrical gradients in

17:52.160 --> 17:53.160
vivo.

17:53.160 --> 17:54.160
So we call this the electric face.

17:54.160 --> 17:58.880
This was first made by my colleague Danny Adams in our group.

17:58.880 --> 18:02.520
And what you can see here is that before the genes come on to pattern the face and before

18:02.520 --> 18:06.200
the anatomy, already you can see where everything is going to be.

18:06.200 --> 18:09.040
Here's where the mouth is going to be, here's the eye, here are the placodes.

18:09.040 --> 18:10.720
This is what you're seeing is resting potential.

18:10.720 --> 18:13.440
This is a dye that reports resting potential.

18:14.440 --> 18:19.680
Even before we had seen this pattern, we had asked this simple question, could we reproduce

18:19.680 --> 18:24.040
these kinds of patterns elsewhere in the body and convince cells to build a completely

18:24.040 --> 18:25.040
different organ?

18:25.040 --> 18:29.240
So here, this is an early experiment by my grad student, Sherry Owl.

18:29.240 --> 18:35.640
And what she did was inject potassium channel RNA into specific cells to induce this kind

18:35.640 --> 18:37.320
of bioelectrical state.

18:37.320 --> 18:39.760
And sure enough, you can make an eye anywhere.

18:39.760 --> 18:43.760
In fact, outside of the region that's normally thought to be the only one competent to make

18:43.760 --> 18:45.080
eyes, you can do this anywhere.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.760
You can do it on the tail and the gut, anywhere you want.

18:47.760 --> 18:51.320
And of course, we're not providing enough information to specify an eye.

18:51.320 --> 18:55.400
These eyes have lens and retina and optic nerve and all that kind of stuff.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.800
We don't have to specify any of that.

18:56.800 --> 19:00.520
What we have to do is give the collective here a pattern that basically, it's a subroutine

19:00.520 --> 19:01.520
call.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.240
It's a pattern that says build an eye here.

19:03.240 --> 19:07.600
And there are other patterns for hearts and legs and brains and various other things.

19:07.600 --> 19:14.640
And one of the cool, so that's kind of neat, but one of the cool competencies here is this.

19:14.640 --> 19:17.800
This is a lens sitting out in the flank of a tail somewhere.

19:17.800 --> 19:23.280
What you'll notice is that the blue cells, so these are marked by a genetic tracer.

19:23.280 --> 19:26.320
The blue cells are the ones that have our ion channel.

19:26.320 --> 19:28.000
These are all wild type cells.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.820
What happens here is two levels of instruction.

19:29.820 --> 19:32.840
We instruct these cells, you need to make an eye.

19:32.840 --> 19:36.600
They can somehow perceive that there's not enough of them to do the job and they end

19:36.600 --> 19:39.840
up communicating and recruiting their neighbors.

19:39.840 --> 19:43.360
So these are the perfectly normal wild type neighbors that get pulled away from their

19:43.360 --> 19:47.520
task of making skin and muscle and various other things and induce now into this eye

19:47.520 --> 19:50.840
building project of exactly the right shape and size.

19:50.840 --> 19:58.280
It's possibly parallels with recruitment in insect swarms and ants and termites and things

19:58.280 --> 19:59.780
like that.

19:59.780 --> 20:04.920
So there's some really interesting dynamics and decision making here that's multi-level.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.520
The other example that I just wanted to show you was planaria.

20:08.520 --> 20:10.440
So these are our flatworms.

20:10.440 --> 20:14.840
I told you they're extremely reliable, but one thing that we want to do if we believe

20:14.840 --> 20:21.000
that the morphogenetic process involves a collective intelligence of these cells building

20:21.000 --> 20:25.920
things, we want to be able to read and write the memories of this collective intelligence.

20:25.920 --> 20:31.480
And so we characterized the electric circuit that determines head number because once you

20:31.480 --> 20:34.560
cut off the head and the tail, this middle fragment has to decide how many heads should

20:34.560 --> 20:37.720
a proper planarian have, one, two, zero, maybe more.

20:37.720 --> 20:42.160
And so what we were able to do is this, by reading the electrical pattern, this is the

20:42.160 --> 20:45.960
electrical pattern that says one head, one tail, we can change that pattern.

20:45.960 --> 20:50.200
This is done with ion channel drugs, no electric fields, no electrodes.

20:50.200 --> 20:54.520
This is manipulating the native interface that these cells are exposing.

20:54.520 --> 20:59.760
And so what you get is you can say two heads here if it's kind of messy, still the technology

20:59.760 --> 21:01.080
is being worked out.

21:01.080 --> 21:04.480
And what this fragment will then do is build a two-headed animal.

21:04.480 --> 21:07.080
This is not Photoshop, these are real two-headed animals.

21:07.080 --> 21:09.200
And here's the most important part.

21:09.200 --> 21:13.440
This electrical map is not a map of this creature down here.

21:13.440 --> 21:18.760
This electrical map is a map of this guy who will not do anything different, still one

21:18.760 --> 21:21.680
head, one tail, normal gene expression.

21:21.680 --> 21:25.900
But if you injure him, if you cut the head and tail, this is the memory that these cells

21:25.900 --> 21:29.480
will use to determine what a correct planarian looks like and then they will build.

21:29.480 --> 21:30.880
It's a counterfactual memory.

21:30.880 --> 21:33.760
It's a representation of something that might be true later.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.240
It's definitely not true now.

21:35.240 --> 21:37.440
And it's a kind of a latent memory.

21:37.440 --> 21:41.280
And so the planarian body can hold one of two different, probably a lot more, but we

21:41.280 --> 21:47.200
found two different representations of what a normal planarian looks like and we can rewrite

21:47.200 --> 21:48.700
it at will.

21:48.700 --> 21:50.480
Here they are, these two-headed worms.

21:50.480 --> 21:55.680
The reason I call this a memory is because if you take these two-headed worms and cut

21:55.680 --> 22:00.840
them again in plain water, no more manipulation, they continue to regenerate to the new shape.

22:01.400 --> 22:02.920
So it's got all the properties of memory.

22:02.920 --> 22:05.640
It's long-term stable, but it's rewriteable.

22:05.640 --> 22:10.680
It has conditional recall, which I just showed you, and there are discrete possible behaviors.

22:10.680 --> 22:14.560
So the question of how many heads should a planarian have is actually, it's a subtle,

22:14.560 --> 22:15.560
where is that information?

22:15.560 --> 22:16.660
Well, it's not in the genome.

22:16.660 --> 22:21.760
What the genome gives you is a piece of electrical hardware that, by default, reliably generates

22:21.760 --> 22:24.720
the memory for one head, but it doesn't have to be that way.

22:24.720 --> 22:29.360
And the very last thing I want to show you, and then I'll stop, is this synthetic kind

22:29.360 --> 22:35.480
of project, where we really want to understand where do these morphogenetic goals come from?

22:35.480 --> 22:41.320
The standard answer is evolution, but we want to see, and again, this is work with Joshua

22:41.320 --> 22:47.240
Bongard, Doug Blackiston did all the biology, Sam Kriegman did the programming, and this

22:47.240 --> 22:50.640
is in our ICDO Institute.

22:50.640 --> 22:55.320
So what we wanted to do was to ask a question about plasticity of these cells.

22:55.320 --> 22:59.800
So we took a frog embryo, Xenopus lavis, Doug collected some of these skin cells from

22:59.800 --> 23:06.920
the animal cap, dissociated them, let them re-associate in a little pile here.

23:06.920 --> 23:07.920
What could they do?

23:07.920 --> 23:08.920
Well, they could die.

23:08.920 --> 23:10.560
They could spread out and go away from each other.

23:10.560 --> 23:12.640
They could form a two-dimensional monolayer.

23:12.640 --> 23:19.880
Instead, what they do is, overnight, they coalesce like this, and they make this little

23:19.880 --> 23:25.240
thing we call a Xenobot for Xenopus lavis and Biobot.

23:25.240 --> 23:28.600
So you can see what it's doing, it moves, because it has little cilia, normally these

23:28.600 --> 23:33.480
are used to redistribute mucus on the surface of the frog, but this thing can use them to

23:33.480 --> 23:34.480
move around.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.480
They can go in circles.

23:35.480 --> 23:36.880
They can patrol back and forth.

23:36.880 --> 23:41.240
They can have collective behaviors, all sorts of different behaviors.

23:41.240 --> 23:44.200
Here's what they look like navigating a maze.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.920
So here it is.

23:45.920 --> 23:49.440
It's going to take this turn here without actually bumping into the opposite wall, so

23:49.440 --> 23:50.440
he takes the turn.

23:50.440 --> 23:54.320
And then at this point, for some reason, we don't know why it decides to turn around

23:54.320 --> 23:55.320
and go back where it came from.

23:55.320 --> 23:58.320
They have a wide variety of behaviors.

23:58.320 --> 23:59.320
You can do calcium imaging.

23:59.320 --> 24:04.960
They have a very rich set of signals, and we can start to use all the tools from behavioral

24:04.960 --> 24:09.680
neuroscience to ask what kind of information integration is happening.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.120
Are they actually communicating?

24:11.120 --> 24:13.040
Is there mutual information?

24:13.040 --> 24:14.040
Stay tuned for that.

24:14.040 --> 24:15.520
But remember, there are no neurons here.

24:15.520 --> 24:16.680
This is just skin.

24:16.680 --> 24:19.960
And so this is what skin does when left to its own devices.

24:19.960 --> 24:22.840
Here's one last thing that it does.

24:22.840 --> 24:28.080
If you give these guys loose materials, so these are just loose skin cells sitting out.

24:28.080 --> 24:29.680
We'll just sprinkle them.

24:29.680 --> 24:35.040
What we find is that these xenobots, their motion is able to corral these cells into

24:35.040 --> 24:40.080
little piles, and then they continue to polish these little piles and sort of push them together.

24:40.080 --> 24:43.560
And because they're working with an agential material, these are not passive particles.

24:43.560 --> 24:44.760
These are cells.

24:44.760 --> 24:50.360
And so we as engineers, evolution, and xenobots are all working in this agential material.

24:50.360 --> 24:54.280
So what they do is they make these little piles, the little piles mature, and become

24:54.280 --> 24:55.680
the next generation of xenobots.

24:55.680 --> 24:56.680
Well, what do they do?

24:56.680 --> 24:59.880
They run around and do exactly the same thing, and now you've got the next generation and

24:59.880 --> 25:00.880
the one after that.

25:00.880 --> 25:06.240
It's sort of von Neumann's dream of a robot making copies of itself from materials at

25:06.240 --> 25:07.240
fine.

25:07.240 --> 25:08.640
So we call this kinematic replication.

25:08.640 --> 25:13.360
And so the last thing I just want to point out is this.

25:13.360 --> 25:16.440
This is the genome of Xenopus lavas.

25:16.440 --> 25:17.440
That's what's in these cells.

25:17.440 --> 25:19.080
We didn't add any genes.

25:19.080 --> 25:20.320
There are no synthetic circuits.

25:20.320 --> 25:21.920
There are no nanomaterials.

25:21.920 --> 25:25.880
So now the question is, what does the genome actually specify?

25:25.880 --> 25:30.920
Well, under default conditions, it specifies this developmental sequence and some tadpole

25:30.920 --> 25:31.920
behavior.

25:31.920 --> 25:35.760
But actually, if you engineer by subtraction, if you take away the influence of a whole

25:35.760 --> 25:40.480
bunch of cells, you get to find out what the skin cell really wants to be doing.

25:40.480 --> 25:44.640
The normal sort of boring two-dimensional life that it has on the outside of the organism

25:44.640 --> 25:48.200
is what it does when it's behavior-shaped by the other cells.

25:48.200 --> 25:50.320
Move that, and you find out what the default behavior is.

25:50.320 --> 25:51.720
The default behavior is this.

25:51.720 --> 25:56.200
Xenobot, a weird developmental sequence, a few weeks later, it turns into this.

25:56.200 --> 25:59.000
We have no idea what this is, completely new.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.200
And then they have this kinematic cell for application behavior.

26:02.200 --> 26:06.160
So unlike all the other creatures we all study, they have no straightforward evolutionary

26:06.160 --> 26:07.160
backstory.

26:07.160 --> 26:09.360
There's never been selection to be a good Xenobot.

26:09.360 --> 26:13.280
Of course, the frog cells were selected.

26:13.280 --> 26:17.920
But they have novel morphological and behavioral outcomes that don't have a straightforward

26:17.960 --> 26:18.960
story.

26:18.960 --> 26:21.880
And we're still working to understand what the cognitive capacities are.

26:21.880 --> 26:27.320
So I'll just end by saying that because biology, as I showed you in the kidney tubule example

26:27.320 --> 26:33.160
and others, the embryo really doesn't have firm expectations or assumptions about what's

26:33.160 --> 26:34.160
going to happen.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.440
You don't know how many cells you're going to have.

26:36.440 --> 26:38.400
You don't know what size your cells are going to be.

26:38.400 --> 26:40.680
You don't know what your genetics are going to be like.

26:40.680 --> 26:45.760
And evolution makes these amazing problem-solving machines that will do something adaptive in

26:45.760 --> 26:47.760
a wide range of circumstances.

26:47.760 --> 26:53.120
And that means that almost any combination of evolved material, designed material, and

26:53.120 --> 26:55.840
software is some kind of agent.

26:55.840 --> 27:02.200
So you've got cyborgs and hybrids and all kinds of synthetic beings.

27:02.200 --> 27:05.640
Everything that Darwin was talking about when he said endless forms most beautiful is a

27:05.640 --> 27:09.080
tiny corner of this enormous option space of beings.

27:09.080 --> 27:12.120
And what that means is that in the future, when we're surrounded by these things, and

27:12.120 --> 27:18.640
I firmly believe that we will be, the old criteria by which we decided how we relate

27:18.640 --> 27:22.200
to something, which is what are you made of and how did you get here, meaning evolved

27:22.200 --> 27:27.360
or designed, those criteria are not going to survive the next decade or two.

27:27.360 --> 27:32.760
We need a completely different basis for ethics to learn to relate to organisms that are very

27:32.760 --> 27:35.120
different from us.

27:35.120 --> 27:39.720
So I will just end here, because I'm already running out of time, just to thank all the

27:39.720 --> 27:45.320
post-docs and students who did this work, our funders, the animals who do all the heavy

27:45.320 --> 27:51.520
lifting in this kind of work, and the two disclosures for commercial relationships.

27:51.520 --> 27:54.520
So thank you very much.

27:54.520 --> 28:02.440
Thank you very much for this very interesting talk, Michael, can you hear me?

28:02.440 --> 28:03.440
Yep.

28:03.440 --> 28:04.440
Great.

28:04.440 --> 28:07.080
So I will be conveying the questions that the audience has, and I would like to ask

28:07.080 --> 28:13.240
the audience to keep them short and simple, we have time maybe for two questions, and

28:13.240 --> 28:14.240
I cannot see hands.

28:14.240 --> 28:21.680
Are there two hands maybe there?

28:21.680 --> 28:31.400
Hello, thank you very much for a very interesting talk.

28:31.400 --> 28:38.520
I just have one little point to make, and that is to do with your very first slide.

28:38.520 --> 28:46.440
You said that to begin with, it's all physics, and thereafter processes take place, biological

28:46.440 --> 28:48.200
processes.

28:48.200 --> 28:52.160
The point is that life comes from life.

28:52.160 --> 28:57.800
There were two living organisms, certainly in terms of sperm and egg.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.880
So it's not a case of just physics.

28:59.880 --> 29:02.440
I wonder what you have to say about that.

29:02.440 --> 29:04.760
So can you hear the questions?

29:04.760 --> 29:06.920
No, I apologize, I couldn't hear any of them.

29:06.920 --> 29:10.600
So it goes back to your first slide that you said the first there was physics, and then

29:10.600 --> 29:14.960
biology kind of kicks in, and the comment is like everything in life starts from life,

29:14.960 --> 29:21.280
so from the egg, and what do you think the role, like would you like to comment on that?

29:21.280 --> 29:23.680
What do you mean by everything starts with physics?

29:23.680 --> 29:24.680
Yeah.

29:25.680 --> 29:33.040
So, of course, the line between living and non-living is not a sharp line.

29:33.040 --> 29:38.200
There are many people doing some very interesting work on really minimal systems that have important

29:38.200 --> 29:43.640
aspects of self-organization and problem solving that you probably wouldn't call alive.

29:43.640 --> 29:48.560
Honestly, I don't spend very much time trying to get a definition of life.

29:48.560 --> 29:52.280
I know other people do, and I'm not an expert on that.

29:53.000 --> 29:59.760
To me, the spectrum of intelligence, including very, very basal examples that you wouldn't

29:59.760 --> 30:06.800
call alive, I think that spectrum is more interesting than the live-not-live kind of

30:06.800 --> 30:07.800
a distinction.

30:07.800 --> 30:11.880
And I think that there are many things that are going to have degrees, including very

30:11.880 --> 30:16.760
basic things, but also more complex things, that we should be considering as important

30:16.760 --> 30:20.640
intelligent agents that do not overlap with the set of living agents, and I think that's

30:20.640 --> 30:22.240
the more important criterion.

30:22.240 --> 30:23.240
Thank you.

30:23.240 --> 30:24.440
Is there a second one?

30:24.440 --> 30:25.440
Short, please.

30:25.440 --> 30:29.440
There are a couple of hands here.

30:39.440 --> 30:43.800
Just a question about the idea of self-replication.

30:43.800 --> 30:50.600
In this example, it seemed that the cells needed to be provided to create what could

30:50.600 --> 30:56.680
be otherwise interpreted as maybe an incidental self-replication, whereas I imagine in most

30:56.680 --> 31:02.000
other systems that are considered self-replicating, the materials for that replication must also

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
be acquired.

31:03.000 --> 31:07.400
So I just wonder if you can comment on this distinction between materials being provided

31:07.400 --> 31:11.520
and materials being acquired.

31:11.520 --> 31:16.040
So the question is about self-replication in the examples that you showed, and whether

31:16.040 --> 31:21.240
the materials need to be provided or acquired, and what do we actually mean in the end by

31:21.240 --> 31:24.240
self-replication?

31:24.240 --> 31:26.520
Yeah, well, great question.

31:26.520 --> 31:31.200
I think like with everything else that I've been talking about, self-replication is a

31:31.200 --> 31:32.200
continuum.

31:32.200 --> 31:35.200
So this is an extremely minimal self-replicating system.

31:35.200 --> 31:41.360
It is not a full kind of, you wouldn't call this a full replicating organism, for example.

31:41.360 --> 31:46.520
It does not have strong heredity, so all of the bots that are made don't bear more resemblance

31:46.520 --> 31:49.800
to their parents than they do to random members of the population.

31:49.800 --> 31:53.360
So there's not that element of strong heredity here.

31:53.360 --> 31:54.360
You're absolutely right.

31:54.360 --> 32:01.240
The cells, the material must be provided by us, so these bots will not go out and bite

32:01.240 --> 32:06.360
little cells off of some other source to release them, although they could be made to do so,

32:06.360 --> 32:10.000
and if they were evolvable, maybe at some point they would do that.

32:10.000 --> 32:14.160
As far as I know, no other creature on Earth does this kind of kinematic replication.

32:14.160 --> 32:19.520
So we see this as a very minimal kind of example along the continuum of self-replication that

32:19.520 --> 32:25.120
starts with nothing and ends with a full kind of completely autonomous replication cycle

32:25.120 --> 32:28.080
that some advanced life forms are able to do.

32:28.080 --> 32:32.040
So this is somewhere in between, and for sure they must be provided with these cells.

32:32.040 --> 32:35.000
They will not acquire these cells by themselves.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
Great.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Thank you very much.

32:38.000 --> 32:42.840
Michael, and at this point we can move on to our next speaker, so thank you once again

32:42.840 --> 32:43.840
for being with us.

32:43.840 --> 32:44.840
I'll make virtually.

32:44.840 --> 32:45.840
Thank you very much.

32:45.840 --> 32:46.840
Thank you very much.

32:46.840 --> 32:47.840
Thank you very much.

32:47.840 --> 32:48.840
Thank you very much.

32:48.840 --> 32:49.840
Thank you very much.

32:49.840 --> 32:50.840
Thank you very much.

32:50.840 --> 32:51.340
Thank you very much.
