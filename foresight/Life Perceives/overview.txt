Checking Life Perceives/From physics to mind - Prof. Michael Levin.txt
1. The question about the origin of life touched on the idea that "life comes from life," referring to the union of a sperm and an egg cell as the starting point for new life. Michael responded by emphasizing the spectrum of intelligence, including non-living systems that exhibit self-organization and problem-solving abilities. He suggested that focusing on the distinction between living and non-living entities may be less interesting than considering a range of intelligent agents along this spectrum.

2. The question regarding self-replication in Michael's examples highlighted that the materials for replication (cells) were provided by humans, rather than being acquired autonomously by the system. Michael clarified that the minimal self-replicating system demonstrated does not possess strong heredity like living organisms do, and it requires external input of cells to replicate. He also noted that this example is a step along the continuum of self-replication, ranging from very basic forms, as shown, to fully autonomous replication cycles found in advanced life forms.
