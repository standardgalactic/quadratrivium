0	5720	It is a great honor to be introducing, albeit virtually, the holder of the Vannevar Busch
5720	10400	endow chair and a distinguished professor in the biology department at Tufts, Professor
10400	12200	Michael Levin.
12200	15680	Director of the Island Discovery Center at Tufts, as well as the Tufts Center for Regenerative
15680	21960	and Developmental Biology, Michael studies the bioelectrical codes that cells use during
21960	28200	the development, injury or regeneration of an organism, and deciphering these codes,
28680	34080	cellular language gives you access to the messages these cells exchange with each other.
34080	39520	So if you can start speaking it, you can make repurposing suggestions, you can instruct
39520	42520	the cellular decisions.
42520	48960	It is probably impossible to summarize neatly the work that Michael Levin has done.
48960	54240	He's working at the, like his work actually is the epitome between computer science and
54240	61160	biology, and I will just mention two of his projects, Xenobots, and distinguishing left
61160	66320	from right, and I will leave the stage to him for his talk from physics to mind, the
66320	70320	journey of cognition seen through the lens of embryonic development.
70320	78320	Thank you so much, let's see, here we go, hopefully you can see my slides.
78400	82400	Thank you for, let's start from the beginning.
82400	87400	Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to share some ideas with you at this amazing
87400	90400	workshop.
90400	96400	Anyone who's interested can contact me or get any of the primary data sets, the software,
96400	100400	all the details, all the protocols, everything else you can get here.
100400	104400	What I thought I would try to do is give you an overview of some of the ideas that we've
104480	108480	been working on and some of their practical implications.
108480	114480	So one of the kind of key things to think about is that many people, when they think
114480	119480	about a cognition, they think about a human, and we all think we know what a human is.
119480	124480	But as Cyril says, sometimes we have to look a little closer at these ideas.
124480	131480	And the fact is that all of us began life as just physics, that is, we were all a quiescent
131560	135560	oocyte at one point, a little blob of chemicals, and that one might look and might say, well,
135560	139560	that's just chemistry, there's no cognition or decision making there.
139560	145560	But eventually this becomes, through an extremely slow and gradual process, step by step, this
145560	150560	becomes one of these complex creatures, including perhaps one with metacognition that makes
150560	156560	claims about anthropomorphisms and being different from other types of physical objects
156560	157560	and so on.
157640	162640	And so it's really important to ask ourselves, how is it that we make this journey across
162640	163640	the Cartesian cut?
163640	166640	How do we get from here to here?
166640	171640	Now, Alan Turing needs no introduction, and he was very interested in unconventional
171640	177640	embodiments of mind, he wanted to know what intelligence was as abstracted from current
177640	181640	implementations in the natural world.
181720	187720	But interestingly enough, he also wrote a paper on morphogenesis, on the creation of
187720	189720	shape in chemical systems.
189720	194720	And you might wonder, why would somebody who's interested in intelligence and computation
194720	197720	be interested in developmental biology in that way?
197720	202720	And I think that this is yet another facet of his brilliance in that he saw, I think,
202720	207720	a deep truth, which is that these two questions are fundamentally the same question, the question
207800	213800	of intelligence, unified intelligence in the mind and the self-assembly of the body are
216800	218800	fundamentally the same question.
218800	222800	And this is a perspective from which we do a lot of our work.
222800	226800	So one thing that people will often say is that things like ant colonies and flocks of
226800	231800	birds and so on, our collective intelligence is maybe, and we can sort of argue about whether
231800	235800	it makes sense for any given collective to call it a collective intelligence.
235880	238880	But then we think, well, we are not like that.
238880	241880	We are not like a flock of birds or a collection of ants.
241880	244880	We have our true unified intelligence.
244880	250880	But I think we need to be very clear that this is just a matter of scale and a particular
250880	252880	lens that we use to view ourselves.
252880	257880	If you actually dig in, what you find out that we are all made of parts, in fact, I
257880	260880	would say that all intelligences are collective intelligences.
260880	262880	We are all made of parts.
262960	267960	So inside of our supposedly unified brain and inside the pineal gland that Descartes
267960	270960	thought was very important because there was just one of them.
270960	272960	Sure, there's just one of them.
272960	273960	But if you look in, what do you see?
273960	274960	You see cells.
274960	279960	And inside of these cells, you see this unbelievably rich mosaic of functional systems that are
279960	281960	doing all kinds of stuff.
281960	284960	This is what's inside every single cell of your body.
284960	289960	So we are all collective intelligences and we are made of something that looks a little
289960	290960	bit like this.
291040	295040	This is a free living organism known as the lacrimaria.
295040	296040	There is no brain.
296040	297040	There's no nervous system.
297040	299040	But you can see what's going on here.
299040	305040	This creature is incredibly competent in handling its small scale goals, so single cell level
305040	311040	goals, such as physiological goals, anatomical goals and metabolic goals.
311040	316040	And if you're into soft robotics or something like that, you'd be very jealous of this.
316040	320040	We don't really have anything that has this incredible level of control.
320120	327120	And we are, in fact, made of diverse cells with all kinds of competencies such as these
327120	332120	that work together on very large projects, whereas individual cells work on single level
332120	335120	cell goals, such as proliferation and metabolic states.
335120	339380	What I'm going to show you is that collections of cells can work on very large goals, such
339380	341180	as making things like this.
341180	346120	So let's think about what this kind of architecture, this is a very unique architecture, what does
346120	347120	allow us to do?
347200	351400	Well, for example, it raises some profound questions.
351400	352480	So here's a caterpillar.
352480	354320	This is a soft-bodied creature.
354320	358400	It has a brain suitable for crawling around on leaves and eating leaves.
358400	361280	So it sort of lives in a two-dimensional world.
361280	365120	It has to turn into this, which is a butterfly, which lives in a three-dimensional world.
365120	370200	It's a hard-bodied kind of creature, completely different controller needed to drive this than
370200	371200	to drive this.
371200	372560	It has a different brain.
372560	375700	During this process, the brain is largely taken apart.
375700	379100	Many of the cells die, most of the connections are taken apart.
379100	383700	But one of the amazing things is that there are data that show that memories persist.
383700	387300	So if you teach something to a caterpillar, the moth or a butterfly actually retains the
387300	393380	information despite this incredible rearrangement of the cognitive medium here.
393380	397060	So you can ask some very basic questions.
397060	400660	We've thought about this issue of what's it like to be a butterfly, but moreover, what's
400660	404380	it like to be a caterpillar changing into a butterfly?
405220	412500	You are an agent and during your lifetime, your mind, your body completely rearranged,
412500	414180	but some of the memories remain.
414180	417700	This is even taken even further by this model system.
417700	418700	These are planaria.
418700	420060	These are flatworms.
420060	424100	And the thing about flatworms is that they are incredibly regenerative.
424100	426580	So every part of the body can be regenerated.
426580	429860	So pieces regrow a whole new head with a brain and everything.
429860	435980	And what McConnell found in the 1960s, and we have since replicated using modern automated
435980	440580	equipment that we've made, is this amazing fact that if you take a planarian and you
440580	448340	train them on a specific task, so to look for food in these little bumpy kinds of regions,
448340	450900	then what you can do is you can amputate the entire head.
450900	454100	The tail will sit there doing nothing for about eight to 10 days.
454100	457660	Then eventually they regrow a new brain, behavior begins.
457660	461060	And then you find out that actually during this time, what had happened was information
461060	466100	that was stored in the rest of the body was somehow imprinted onto this new brain.
466100	469620	Not only is information stored outside the brain, and they have a true centralized brain
469620	476420	that would just like we do, they're not like a distributed starfish or anything.
476420	481460	Not only can information be stored outside of the brain, but actually can be moved through
481460	485180	the body and can be imprinted onto a brand new fresh brain.
485180	490540	And so then you can sort of ask philosophical questions like that, the malfunctioning transporter
490540	491540	experiment.
491540	495820	What happens if somebody makes a copy of you and forgets to destroy the original?
495820	497140	This actually happens in planaria.
497140	503540	You can cut this thing into pieces, and every piece is in an important way, both in physical
503540	507260	and somatic and cognitive continuity with the original.
507260	512620	So you can see there's this biology has this amazing plasticity and also this relationship
512620	516300	between behavioral memories and anatomical memories.
516300	521140	And when we'll talk more about this, that plasticity extends to vertebrates.
521140	525020	So what we've done here is, this is the work of Doug Blackistan in our group.
525020	527660	This is a tappel of the frog Xenopus lavas.
527660	528660	Here are the nostrils.
528660	529660	Here's the mouth.
529660	530660	Here's the brain.
530660	531900	And you'll notice there are no eyes up here.
531900	535700	We prevented these eyes from forming, but we did put an eye on the tail.
535700	537860	And I'll show you in a few minutes how we do that.
537860	541780	What we find out is that when you make animals like this and you test them using this behavior
541780	546340	testing apparatus that we built, it's an automated training and testing device, what
546340	549260	you find is that these animals can see quite well.
549260	553260	And in fact, these eyes form, even though they're sitting in the middle of muscle instead
553260	556380	of in their normal position in the brain, they make an optic nerve.
556380	559940	The optic nerve does not connect to the brain, at best it connects to the spinal cord right
559940	560940	here.
560940	567340	And without eons of evolutionary adaptation, without any of that, immediately out of the
567340	573340	box, these animals can see with this radically different sensory architecture.
573340	578300	So as we think about what does life perceive and how does it handle novelty, we can do
578300	583100	these kinds of experiments and find out that it's really much broader than the standard
583100	587060	reliability of development would lead us to believe.
587060	593940	So biology uses this multi-scale competency architecture where not only are we structurally
593940	599100	a nested set of nested dolls, but actually each of these layers solves problems in their
599100	600460	own spaces.
600460	605580	So these are transcriptional spaces, physiological spaces, and anatomical morpho space.
605580	608900	And when you're traversing, when you're some sort of a system that traverses these problem
608900	612620	spaces, we can ask with what level of competency.
612620	616500	And so we study different kinds of intelligence.
616500	621500	I like this due to William James, which is the ability to reach the same goal by different
621500	622500	means.
622500	628060	And then simply some sort of feed forward emergence where local rules give rise to some kind of
628060	629060	complexity.
629060	632180	There's potentially a whole other factor here.
632180	640740	And Wiener and colleagues produce this kind of cybernetic scale to express the different
640740	645220	kinds of competencies that you might have in navigating these sorts of spaces.
645220	651980	So we are all very good at, as most animals are, very good at noticing agency and intelligence
651980	653940	in the three-dimensional world.
653940	659900	All of our senses are primed for that to recognize medium-sized objects moving at medium speeds
659900	661380	and doing intelligent things.
661380	664940	But there are also some other spaces where we're really just beginning to understand
664940	666900	what intelligence looks like in these spaces.
666900	671100	And I only have time to talk about one, and this is my favorite one, anatomical morpho
671100	675300	space, which is the space of possible shapes that you can make out of cells.
675300	677460	So let's just ask a very basic question.
677460	678780	Where do anatomies come from?
678780	682620	This is a section through a human torso.
682620	687140	You can see the amazing order, the amazing invariant order of all this structure.
687140	688220	So where is it?
688220	692140	And you might be tempted to think it's in the DNA, but of course, we can read genomes
692140	696660	now and we know what's in the DNA, which is the instructions for micro-level hardware
696660	698580	of every cell, so the proteins.
698580	703940	We still need to understand how does the behavior of these cells give rise to something
703940	704940	like this?
704940	708260	How, if something is missing, we could cause these cells to rebuild?
708260	714420	So regenerative medicine in its engineers, and I'll show you at the end a synthetic organism.
714420	717540	What else can we make the exact same cells do?
717540	719200	So what is the plasticity here?
719200	722540	So one example of this kind of problem solving is something that we discovered a few years
722540	728180	ago, which is that when tadpoles turn into frogs, they have to rearrange their face.
728180	731940	So the eyes, the jaws, the nostrils, the mouth, everything has to move and you get from this
731940	733780	state to this state.
733780	735780	This was thought to be a hard-wired process.
735780	740380	Every organ just moves the right distance in the right direction and you get your frog.
740380	746740	We decided to test that hypothesis and ask actually how much competency is in this scheme.
746740	750100	And so we created so-called Picasso tadpoles.
750100	751100	Everything here is in the wrong place.
751100	756060	The eyes off to the side, the mouth is maybe on top of the head, everything is shifted.
756060	760660	And what you find is that remarkably, these animals tend to make pretty normal frogs because
760660	766300	all of this stuff will move around through abnormal paths and sometimes go too far and
766300	770460	actually have to come back until it gets to a correct frog face and then it stops.
770460	775340	So what the genetics actually gives you is a system that can do an error minimization
775340	780860	scheme and it can navigate this morpho space and reach the correct goal from different
780860	781860	starting positions.
781860	784260	It doesn't just do the same thing every single time.
784260	789500	It actually is able to get around, for example, local maxima and things like that and get
789500	791940	to where it's going in morpho space.
791940	792940	Mammals do this too.
792940	796320	If you cut an early embryo in half, you don't get two half embryos.
796320	799340	You get two perfectly normal monosygotic twins.
799340	802820	My favorite example of this kind of thing is this.
802820	804340	This is very old work now.
804340	809940	This is a cross section through a kidney tubule in a salamander and you can see that basically
809940	815280	eight to 10 cells normally work together, cell to cell signaling, they make this lumen.
815280	821040	If you force the cells to be a larger size and you can do these tricks in this model,
821040	825560	then fewer cells will get together to give you the exact same size lumen.
825560	830160	That's pretty cool already, but the best part is, if you make the cells truly gigantic,
830160	836200	then one single cell will bend around itself and give you the exact same lumen.
836200	840040	Now, what's cool about that is this is a great example of top-down causation because this
840040	842240	is a completely different molecular mechanism.
842240	843640	This is cell-to-cell communication.
843640	845000	This is cytoskeletal bending.
845520	850160	In the service of a large-scale anatomical structure, meaning a particular location with
850160	856080	an anatomical morphospace, different molecular mechanisms get called up to enable the behavior
856080	860120	that gets you to the right place.
860120	864860	The microstates and the mechanisms are called up as needed to serve a large-scale sort of
864860	869800	executive kind of navigation policy in this space.
869800	871840	How could this possibly work?
871840	874080	Well, we have a precedent, of course.
874080	877400	The precedent is the brain and nervous system.
877400	884480	That's exactly what happens in neuroscience, which is that we have large-scale cognitive
884480	892440	goals, in that case in three-dimensional space, which what the nervous system does is transduce
892440	897280	that level of information processing down into the molecular steps that activate your
897280	901520	muscles and your glands and everything else.
901560	906480	You've got this hardware-software scheme where the output of these electrical networks drives
906480	911360	the movement of your body through three-dimensional space, and then you can do this neural decoding
911360	914600	kind of thing where, well, can we learn to read this information and make predictions
914600	915600	and so on?
915600	920480	But the super interesting thing is that actually this scheme is incredibly old.
920480	924440	It's way older than neurons and brains, evolutionarily.
924440	928640	Evolution discovered the benefits of electrical networks somewhere around the time of bacterial
928640	929640	biofilms.
929760	937200	Actually, it's very isomorphic to this system where prior to neurons and the nervous systems
937200	944120	and brains, what bioelectric networks through the rest of the body did was that they controlled
944120	949680	the movement of your body configuration through morpho space.
949680	953960	Very similar thing, except that what evolution did was pivot from one space into another,
953960	958720	and actually in many ways pivoted from control of spatial patterns to control of temporal
958720	964360	patterns in neural processing, but otherwise all the same tricks are usable and all the
964360	966880	same techniques are usable.
966880	972560	We developed some of the first tools to read and write electrical pattern memories in tissues
972560	977280	that were not neurons, but basically we took a lot from neuroscience, both conceptually
977280	979240	and practically.
979240	984920	We use optogenetics and active inference frameworks and all the same stuff.
984920	991000	This allows us to do things like this, to specifically try to learn to communicate different
991000	994320	morphological paths to groups of cells.
994320	998840	So frogs, unlike salamanders, do not regenerate their legs, and through asking what kind of
998840	1005520	a signal would convince these cells to go down, build a leg trajectory versus the scar
1005520	1010280	and stop trajectory, we were able to come up with a very simple trigger, literally lasts
1010280	1015840	just one day, and what it does is it induces leg regeneration for over a year and a half.
1015840	1019760	We're not there 3D printing it, we're not there managing stem cells.
1019760	1023440	Our job is right at the beginning to convince this group of cells that what they're going
1023440	1027000	to be doing is embarking on this particular path through morpho space.
1027000	1032800	And so what happens is within 45 days you've got your regenerative genes, you've got your
1032800	1037640	toes, you've got a toenail, and eventually you get a pretty respectable looking leg that's
1037640	1040600	both touch sensitive and motile.
1040600	1044600	So and this, of course, we're now pushing this into rodents, I have to do a disclosure
1044600	1049560	here because Dave Kaplan and I are co-founders of this company that's going to try to move
1049560	1053920	this towards patients, but the idea here is to learn to communicate with this cellular
1053920	1058840	collective to understand what does it measure, what can it sense in morpho space, and what
1058840	1063800	are the efficient stimuli, the trigger points that can get it to make the decisions we want
1063800	1064800	to make.
1064800	1067200	So let me give you one particular example.
1067200	1072160	What you're seeing here is this is our method of visualizing bioelectrical gradients in
1072160	1073160	vivo.
1073160	1074160	So we call this the electric face.
1074160	1078880	This was first made by my colleague Danny Adams in our group.
1078880	1082520	And what you can see here is that before the genes come on to pattern the face and before
1082520	1086200	the anatomy, already you can see where everything is going to be.
1086200	1089040	Here's where the mouth is going to be, here's the eye, here are the placodes.
1089040	1090720	This is what you're seeing is resting potential.
1090720	1093440	This is a dye that reports resting potential.
1094440	1099680	Even before we had seen this pattern, we had asked this simple question, could we reproduce
1099680	1104040	these kinds of patterns elsewhere in the body and convince cells to build a completely
1104040	1105040	different organ?
1105040	1109240	So here, this is an early experiment by my grad student, Sherry Owl.
1109240	1115640	And what she did was inject potassium channel RNA into specific cells to induce this kind
1115640	1117320	of bioelectrical state.
1117320	1119760	And sure enough, you can make an eye anywhere.
1119760	1123760	In fact, outside of the region that's normally thought to be the only one competent to make
1123760	1125080	eyes, you can do this anywhere.
1125080	1127760	You can do it on the tail and the gut, anywhere you want.
1127760	1131320	And of course, we're not providing enough information to specify an eye.
1131320	1135400	These eyes have lens and retina and optic nerve and all that kind of stuff.
1135400	1136800	We don't have to specify any of that.
1136800	1140520	What we have to do is give the collective here a pattern that basically, it's a subroutine
1140520	1141520	call.
1141520	1143240	It's a pattern that says build an eye here.
1143240	1147600	And there are other patterns for hearts and legs and brains and various other things.
1147600	1154640	And one of the cool, so that's kind of neat, but one of the cool competencies here is this.
1154640	1157800	This is a lens sitting out in the flank of a tail somewhere.
1157800	1163280	What you'll notice is that the blue cells, so these are marked by a genetic tracer.
1163280	1166320	The blue cells are the ones that have our ion channel.
1166320	1168000	These are all wild type cells.
1168000	1169820	What happens here is two levels of instruction.
1169820	1172840	We instruct these cells, you need to make an eye.
1172840	1176600	They can somehow perceive that there's not enough of them to do the job and they end
1176600	1179840	up communicating and recruiting their neighbors.
1179840	1183360	So these are the perfectly normal wild type neighbors that get pulled away from their
1183360	1187520	task of making skin and muscle and various other things and induce now into this eye
1187520	1190840	building project of exactly the right shape and size.
1190840	1198280	It's possibly parallels with recruitment in insect swarms and ants and termites and things
1198280	1199780	like that.
1199780	1204920	So there's some really interesting dynamics and decision making here that's multi-level.
1205000	1208520	The other example that I just wanted to show you was planaria.
1208520	1210440	So these are our flatworms.
1210440	1214840	I told you they're extremely reliable, but one thing that we want to do if we believe
1214840	1221000	that the morphogenetic process involves a collective intelligence of these cells building
1221000	1225920	things, we want to be able to read and write the memories of this collective intelligence.
1225920	1231480	And so we characterized the electric circuit that determines head number because once you
1231480	1234560	cut off the head and the tail, this middle fragment has to decide how many heads should
1234560	1237720	a proper planarian have, one, two, zero, maybe more.
1237720	1242160	And so what we were able to do is this, by reading the electrical pattern, this is the
1242160	1245960	electrical pattern that says one head, one tail, we can change that pattern.
1245960	1250200	This is done with ion channel drugs, no electric fields, no electrodes.
1250200	1254520	This is manipulating the native interface that these cells are exposing.
1254520	1259760	And so what you get is you can say two heads here if it's kind of messy, still the technology
1259760	1261080	is being worked out.
1261080	1264480	And what this fragment will then do is build a two-headed animal.
1264480	1267080	This is not Photoshop, these are real two-headed animals.
1267080	1269200	And here's the most important part.
1269200	1273440	This electrical map is not a map of this creature down here.
1273440	1278760	This electrical map is a map of this guy who will not do anything different, still one
1278760	1281680	head, one tail, normal gene expression.
1281680	1285900	But if you injure him, if you cut the head and tail, this is the memory that these cells
1285900	1289480	will use to determine what a correct planarian looks like and then they will build.
1289480	1290880	It's a counterfactual memory.
1290880	1293760	It's a representation of something that might be true later.
1293760	1295240	It's definitely not true now.
1295240	1297440	And it's a kind of a latent memory.
1297440	1301280	And so the planarian body can hold one of two different, probably a lot more, but we
1301280	1307200	found two different representations of what a normal planarian looks like and we can rewrite
1307200	1308700	it at will.
1308700	1310480	Here they are, these two-headed worms.
1310480	1315680	The reason I call this a memory is because if you take these two-headed worms and cut
1315680	1320840	them again in plain water, no more manipulation, they continue to regenerate to the new shape.
1321400	1322920	So it's got all the properties of memory.
1322920	1325640	It's long-term stable, but it's rewriteable.
1325640	1330680	It has conditional recall, which I just showed you, and there are discrete possible behaviors.
1330680	1334560	So the question of how many heads should a planarian have is actually, it's a subtle,
1334560	1335560	where is that information?
1335560	1336660	Well, it's not in the genome.
1336660	1341760	What the genome gives you is a piece of electrical hardware that, by default, reliably generates
1341760	1344720	the memory for one head, but it doesn't have to be that way.
1344720	1349360	And the very last thing I want to show you, and then I'll stop, is this synthetic kind
1349360	1355480	of project, where we really want to understand where do these morphogenetic goals come from?
1355480	1361320	The standard answer is evolution, but we want to see, and again, this is work with Joshua
1361320	1367240	Bongard, Doug Blackiston did all the biology, Sam Kriegman did the programming, and this
1367240	1370640	is in our ICDO Institute.
1370640	1375320	So what we wanted to do was to ask a question about plasticity of these cells.
1375320	1379800	So we took a frog embryo, Xenopus lavis, Doug collected some of these skin cells from
1379800	1386920	the animal cap, dissociated them, let them re-associate in a little pile here.
1386920	1387920	What could they do?
1387920	1388920	Well, they could die.
1388920	1390560	They could spread out and go away from each other.
1390560	1392640	They could form a two-dimensional monolayer.
1392640	1399880	Instead, what they do is, overnight, they coalesce like this, and they make this little
1399880	1405240	thing we call a Xenobot for Xenopus lavis and Biobot.
1405240	1408600	So you can see what it's doing, it moves, because it has little cilia, normally these
1408600	1413480	are used to redistribute mucus on the surface of the frog, but this thing can use them to
1413480	1414480	move around.
1414480	1415480	They can go in circles.
1415480	1416880	They can patrol back and forth.
1416880	1421240	They can have collective behaviors, all sorts of different behaviors.
1421240	1424200	Here's what they look like navigating a maze.
1424200	1425920	So here it is.
1425920	1429440	It's going to take this turn here without actually bumping into the opposite wall, so
1429440	1430440	he takes the turn.
1430440	1434320	And then at this point, for some reason, we don't know why it decides to turn around
1434320	1435320	and go back where it came from.
1435320	1438320	They have a wide variety of behaviors.
1438320	1439320	You can do calcium imaging.
1439320	1444960	They have a very rich set of signals, and we can start to use all the tools from behavioral
1444960	1449680	neuroscience to ask what kind of information integration is happening.
1449680	1451120	Are they actually communicating?
1451120	1453040	Is there mutual information?
1453040	1454040	Stay tuned for that.
1454040	1455520	But remember, there are no neurons here.
1455520	1456680	This is just skin.
1456680	1459960	And so this is what skin does when left to its own devices.
1459960	1462840	Here's one last thing that it does.
1462840	1468080	If you give these guys loose materials, so these are just loose skin cells sitting out.
1468080	1469680	We'll just sprinkle them.
1469680	1475040	What we find is that these xenobots, their motion is able to corral these cells into
1475040	1480080	little piles, and then they continue to polish these little piles and sort of push them together.
1480080	1483560	And because they're working with an agential material, these are not passive particles.
1483560	1484760	These are cells.
1484760	1490360	And so we as engineers, evolution, and xenobots are all working in this agential material.
1490360	1494280	So what they do is they make these little piles, the little piles mature, and become
1494280	1495680	the next generation of xenobots.
1495680	1496680	Well, what do they do?
1496680	1499880	They run around and do exactly the same thing, and now you've got the next generation and
1499880	1500880	the one after that.
1500880	1506240	It's sort of von Neumann's dream of a robot making copies of itself from materials at
1506240	1507240	fine.
1507240	1508640	So we call this kinematic replication.
1508640	1513360	And so the last thing I just want to point out is this.
1513360	1516440	This is the genome of Xenopus lavas.
1516440	1517440	That's what's in these cells.
1517440	1519080	We didn't add any genes.
1519080	1520320	There are no synthetic circuits.
1520320	1521920	There are no nanomaterials.
1521920	1525880	So now the question is, what does the genome actually specify?
1525880	1530920	Well, under default conditions, it specifies this developmental sequence and some tadpole
1530920	1531920	behavior.
1531920	1535760	But actually, if you engineer by subtraction, if you take away the influence of a whole
1535760	1540480	bunch of cells, you get to find out what the skin cell really wants to be doing.
1540480	1544640	The normal sort of boring two-dimensional life that it has on the outside of the organism
1544640	1548200	is what it does when it's behavior-shaped by the other cells.
1548200	1550320	Move that, and you find out what the default behavior is.
1550320	1551720	The default behavior is this.
1551720	1556200	Xenobot, a weird developmental sequence, a few weeks later, it turns into this.
1556200	1559000	We have no idea what this is, completely new.
1559000	1562200	And then they have this kinematic cell for application behavior.
1562200	1566160	So unlike all the other creatures we all study, they have no straightforward evolutionary
1566160	1567160	backstory.
1567160	1569360	There's never been selection to be a good Xenobot.
1569360	1573280	Of course, the frog cells were selected.
1573280	1577920	But they have novel morphological and behavioral outcomes that don't have a straightforward
1577960	1578960	story.
1578960	1581880	And we're still working to understand what the cognitive capacities are.
1581880	1587320	So I'll just end by saying that because biology, as I showed you in the kidney tubule example
1587320	1593160	and others, the embryo really doesn't have firm expectations or assumptions about what's
1593160	1594160	going to happen.
1594160	1596440	You don't know how many cells you're going to have.
1596440	1598400	You don't know what size your cells are going to be.
1598400	1600680	You don't know what your genetics are going to be like.
1600680	1605760	And evolution makes these amazing problem-solving machines that will do something adaptive in
1605760	1607760	a wide range of circumstances.
1607760	1613120	And that means that almost any combination of evolved material, designed material, and
1613120	1615840	software is some kind of agent.
1615840	1622200	So you've got cyborgs and hybrids and all kinds of synthetic beings.
1622200	1625640	Everything that Darwin was talking about when he said endless forms most beautiful is a
1625640	1629080	tiny corner of this enormous option space of beings.
1629080	1632120	And what that means is that in the future, when we're surrounded by these things, and
1632120	1638640	I firmly believe that we will be, the old criteria by which we decided how we relate
1638640	1642200	to something, which is what are you made of and how did you get here, meaning evolved
1642200	1647360	or designed, those criteria are not going to survive the next decade or two.
1647360	1652760	We need a completely different basis for ethics to learn to relate to organisms that are very
1652760	1655120	different from us.
1655120	1659720	So I will just end here, because I'm already running out of time, just to thank all the
1659720	1665320	post-docs and students who did this work, our funders, the animals who do all the heavy
1665320	1671520	lifting in this kind of work, and the two disclosures for commercial relationships.
1671520	1674520	So thank you very much.
1674520	1682440	Thank you very much for this very interesting talk, Michael, can you hear me?
1682440	1683440	Yep.
1683440	1684440	Great.
1684440	1687080	So I will be conveying the questions that the audience has, and I would like to ask
1687080	1693240	the audience to keep them short and simple, we have time maybe for two questions, and
1693240	1694240	I cannot see hands.
1694240	1701680	Are there two hands maybe there?
1701680	1711400	Hello, thank you very much for a very interesting talk.
1711400	1718520	I just have one little point to make, and that is to do with your very first slide.
1718520	1726440	You said that to begin with, it's all physics, and thereafter processes take place, biological
1726440	1728200	processes.
1728200	1732160	The point is that life comes from life.
1732160	1737800	There were two living organisms, certainly in terms of sperm and egg.
1737800	1739880	So it's not a case of just physics.
1739880	1742440	I wonder what you have to say about that.
1742440	1744760	So can you hear the questions?
1744760	1746920	No, I apologize, I couldn't hear any of them.
1746920	1750600	So it goes back to your first slide that you said the first there was physics, and then
1750600	1754960	biology kind of kicks in, and the comment is like everything in life starts from life,
1754960	1761280	so from the egg, and what do you think the role, like would you like to comment on that?
1761280	1763680	What do you mean by everything starts with physics?
1763680	1764680	Yeah.
1765680	1773040	So, of course, the line between living and non-living is not a sharp line.
1773040	1778200	There are many people doing some very interesting work on really minimal systems that have important
1778200	1783640	aspects of self-organization and problem solving that you probably wouldn't call alive.
1783640	1788560	Honestly, I don't spend very much time trying to get a definition of life.
1788560	1792280	I know other people do, and I'm not an expert on that.
1793000	1799760	To me, the spectrum of intelligence, including very, very basal examples that you wouldn't
1799760	1806800	call alive, I think that spectrum is more interesting than the live-not-live kind of
1806800	1807800	a distinction.
1807800	1811880	And I think that there are many things that are going to have degrees, including very
1811880	1816760	basic things, but also more complex things, that we should be considering as important
1816760	1820640	intelligent agents that do not overlap with the set of living agents, and I think that's
1820640	1822240	the more important criterion.
1822240	1823240	Thank you.
1823240	1824440	Is there a second one?
1824440	1825440	Short, please.
1825440	1829440	There are a couple of hands here.
1839440	1843800	Just a question about the idea of self-replication.
1843800	1850600	In this example, it seemed that the cells needed to be provided to create what could
1850600	1856680	be otherwise interpreted as maybe an incidental self-replication, whereas I imagine in most
1856680	1862000	other systems that are considered self-replicating, the materials for that replication must also
1862000	1863000	be acquired.
1863000	1867400	So I just wonder if you can comment on this distinction between materials being provided
1867400	1871520	and materials being acquired.
1871520	1876040	So the question is about self-replication in the examples that you showed, and whether
1876040	1881240	the materials need to be provided or acquired, and what do we actually mean in the end by
1881240	1884240	self-replication?
1884240	1886520	Yeah, well, great question.
1886520	1891200	I think like with everything else that I've been talking about, self-replication is a
1891200	1892200	continuum.
1892200	1895200	So this is an extremely minimal self-replicating system.
1895200	1901360	It is not a full kind of, you wouldn't call this a full replicating organism, for example.
1901360	1906520	It does not have strong heredity, so all of the bots that are made don't bear more resemblance
1906520	1909800	to their parents than they do to random members of the population.
1909800	1913360	So there's not that element of strong heredity here.
1913360	1914360	You're absolutely right.
1914360	1921240	The cells, the material must be provided by us, so these bots will not go out and bite
1921240	1926360	little cells off of some other source to release them, although they could be made to do so,
1926360	1930000	and if they were evolvable, maybe at some point they would do that.
1930000	1934160	As far as I know, no other creature on Earth does this kind of kinematic replication.
1934160	1939520	So we see this as a very minimal kind of example along the continuum of self-replication that
1939520	1945120	starts with nothing and ends with a full kind of completely autonomous replication cycle
1945120	1948080	that some advanced life forms are able to do.
1948080	1952040	So this is somewhere in between, and for sure they must be provided with these cells.
1952040	1955000	They will not acquire these cells by themselves.
1955000	1956000	Great.
1956000	1958000	Thank you very much.
