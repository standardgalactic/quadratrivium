Processing Overview for DevGAMM
============================
Checking DevGAMM/Preventing the Collapse of Civilization â§¸ Jonathan Blow (Thekla, Inc).txt
1. The speaker acknowledges the question about Edsger Dijkstra's "The Humble Programmer" from 1968, where Dijkstra expressed skepticism about whether programming would ever be made easy enough for non-specialists.
2. The speaker believes that simplifying tools and interfaces can make a significant difference in how accessible programming is, even if it doesn't eliminate all complexity.
3. The goal is to reduce the actual complexity we face when programming, which is distinct from the inherent complexity of certain problems.
4. The speaker aims to get closer to an "ideal complexity" where the tools and languages we use align better with our thought processes and reduce unnecessary complications that interfere with creativity and flow.
5. While it's not guaranteed that this will make programming completely understandable for everyone, the speaker believes that these efforts can bring us closer to a more user-friendly programming experience.
