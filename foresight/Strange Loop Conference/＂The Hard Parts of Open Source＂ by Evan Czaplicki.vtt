00:00.000 --> 00:14.960
Welcome, everybody. Thanks for coming to this session. So I'm Evan Trepliki. I'm the designer

00:14.960 --> 00:20.520
of the Elm programming language. And I got started on it about seven years ago with a

00:20.520 --> 00:25.960
paper called Elm Concurrent FRP for Functional Goose. And I was like, I really think I can

00:25.960 --> 00:31.040
make this functional programming stuff easier. And I didn't nail it immediately with that

00:31.040 --> 00:37.840
title. But I had this idea of this experience with type functional programming that was

00:37.840 --> 00:43.640
really joyful. And what I wanted to get out with Elm was I wanted to take that part that

00:43.640 --> 00:49.480
I felt was so fun and make it accessible to other people and share that joy that I had

00:49.480 --> 00:53.720
felt. And so part of that is technical. You have to write a compiler and all this kind

00:53.720 --> 01:00.040
of stuff. But another part is like practical stuff. Like getting set up should be easy.

01:00.040 --> 01:04.880
And that was part of what was important to me having spent a whole day just trying to

01:04.880 --> 01:09.060
learn something, trying to see if something was interesting and being really frustrated.

01:09.060 --> 01:13.240
Another piece of that was if program is going to be fun, I want the community to be friendly.

01:13.240 --> 01:18.400
I didn't want it to be a cool club for the cool kids. You know, oh, we're functional

01:18.400 --> 01:24.560
programmers and you're not because you're dumb. Like, I didn't relate to that. I just

01:24.560 --> 01:29.280
had a nice time programming and I wanted to share that nice time in the same way that

01:29.280 --> 01:35.480
I like sushi. And I might say, hey, you should try it out. It's pretty nice. And so I might

01:35.480 --> 01:43.200
say, no, thanks. Oh, okay. You know, that's the kind of interactions I wanted to have

01:43.200 --> 01:50.080
because it was just about having this experience. So as I've talked to more open source developers,

01:50.080 --> 01:55.080
people who design languages, people work on databases, people work on machine learning

01:55.080 --> 02:01.720
or discussion platforms or environmental sensors, however much we disagree on design

02:01.720 --> 02:07.560
or what our goals are, we all have stories in common about like having a friendly community

02:07.560 --> 02:11.360
is really, really difficult. And that's one of the places in open source where, you know,

02:11.360 --> 02:16.240
as good as you can be at the technical stuff, like you don't have a lot of, ultimately, you

02:16.240 --> 02:20.680
can't control what's going to happen. And if someone's going to yell, it's like, I wish

02:20.680 --> 02:27.360
that didn't happen. So I've been doing this for about seven years now and I've started

02:27.360 --> 02:32.040
to notice some patterns of behavior that I think probably a lot of people who've worked

02:32.040 --> 02:39.440
in open source with larger prize will relate to. So one is this, why don't you just? And

02:39.440 --> 02:45.000
in Elm, it's like, why don't you just get the JS API directly or release an incremental

02:45.000 --> 02:51.520
version instead of a bigger release or, hey, can we derive JSON decoders? And the short

02:51.520 --> 02:56.920
answer in all these cases is that it's more complex than it sounds. Like if there's something

02:56.920 --> 03:02.600
that you can think of in five minutes or an hour or a day, probably someone has thought

03:02.600 --> 03:06.280
about that and considered it. And there might be implications that you don't see from your

03:06.280 --> 03:10.620
perspective, but someone else in the community might have a problem with that that's not

03:10.620 --> 03:15.800
obvious to you. So when you're doing design, why don't you just? It's like, well, there's

03:15.800 --> 03:20.720
all these different parties that we have to sort of make things work for. And I can do

03:20.720 --> 03:25.400
my best on my intuition, but ultimately, even after I spend like a week trying to design

03:25.400 --> 03:28.960
something that way, I need to go out and show it to people and see what objections they

03:28.960 --> 03:35.320
bring and then maybe do it with another design. So this why don't you just is like, it's quite

03:35.360 --> 03:39.520
frustrating. And one thing that happens is there's a lot of people who are new to the

03:39.520 --> 03:43.160
project. So maybe there's 10,000 people who might be curious, like, oh, why don't you

03:43.160 --> 03:48.440
just try out this kind of thing? And the number of people who know the full context is pretty

03:48.440 --> 03:54.080
small. So maybe there's like 10, 20 people. So if it takes five minutes to say, why don't

03:54.080 --> 03:58.160
you just blah, blah, blah? And it takes two pages of writing. And you have to write it

03:58.160 --> 04:02.200
very carefully because if you're an influential community member, people will refer back to

04:02.240 --> 04:07.080
what you said four or five years ago and say like, man, there's such a jerk here. Here's

04:07.080 --> 04:13.200
the evidence. They said this in 2013. And it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I said that in

04:13.200 --> 04:23.040
2013. Yeah. So one thing that's common is like, well, if it's so much work, like, why don't

04:23.040 --> 04:29.160
you just delegate the work, right? So this is a comment I got in real life and the italics

04:29.240 --> 04:34.120
are from the person talking to me. They said there's another way to deal with this, like,

04:34.120 --> 04:39.120
delegation. And then they go on to describe how delegation works and what benefits it might

04:39.120 --> 04:46.160
have. I was like, oh, very interesting. Yes, I hadn't thought about that. And they describe

04:46.160 --> 04:51.000
a person who can do all this work. And they say this somebody, again, that is their italics,

04:51.000 --> 04:58.320
can also be a proxy who's gathering feedback. So like, you don't have to be in these discussions.

04:58.480 --> 05:06.680
So I was initially very upset about this. So like the unfiltered in my own mind version was

05:06.680 --> 05:12.960
like, oh, hello, is this the somebody store? Yes, we'd like someone to take unsolicited advice on

05:12.960 --> 05:18.080
the internet. Oh, yeah, it's it's really mean. Yeah, it's it's going to be rough. And no, yeah,

05:18.080 --> 05:25.160
no one's going to say thank you. Yeah, no, it's it's unpaid. Yeah, it's unpaid. It takes you

05:26.040 --> 05:34.120
don't have any. I was told there would be somebody who would do this. And, you know, so this was

05:34.120 --> 05:42.160
me in my own life, like walking around my room, just like, and that's, you know, that's not a

05:42.160 --> 05:46.440
healthy place to be. That's not how I want to look to a community. That's not what I want the

05:46.440 --> 05:52.520
community. I'm a part of to be either. And when I took some time and thought about it more, I

05:52.560 --> 05:57.160
realized there's actually like a pretty reasonable assumption going on here, which is like free

05:57.160 --> 06:03.880
rice means you can take as much as you want. The rest is free. Take a lot of rice. And so does

06:03.880 --> 06:10.000
that imply that free labor means you can use as much as you want? Well, the labor's free. But in

06:10.000 --> 06:15.960
fact, this isn't how labor works. If you don't pay for labor, you get less. And so I think that's

06:15.960 --> 06:20.920
sort of the root thing. It's like, Oh, well, it should be unlimited. Anyone can help. Now, let's

06:20.960 --> 06:25.760
assume it is unlimited that everybody in the world actually can help. In practice, you actually

06:25.760 --> 06:33.080
have to work together, right? These are highly technical projects. Are you able to work well

06:33.080 --> 06:37.480
together? Is your goals with the project aligned? How much time does it take to coordinate with

06:37.480 --> 06:41.520
that person to get stuff done? So even if you can work with anybody you want, there's still

06:41.520 --> 06:46.960
these limitations on like who is going to be really effective in doing the right stuff. So I

06:47.000 --> 06:54.800
wrote about that a little bit in this post. I think, no, sorry, Richard wrote about that in this

06:54.800 --> 07:01.800
post here of like, what actually does it take to get involved? And it's like, it's not just somebody

07:01.800 --> 07:08.120
store. So, you know, some people may be thinking like, you know, Evan, you're doing a lot of telling

07:08.120 --> 07:14.480
us what's the situation, but like, who are you to say that? And so this is another pattern that I

07:14.520 --> 07:20.360
see a lot. It's like on who's authority. And this is actually the title of a post that was sent

07:20.360 --> 07:30.360
to the closure community. And the post started out, F closure. There I said it, and God, it feels

07:30.360 --> 07:41.320
good. I say it with much admiration and respect to all the community members. And then they go on

07:41.320 --> 07:46.960
to say some criticisms and talk about the relationship with women. And it's quite a roller

07:46.960 --> 07:58.040
coaster of a post. But what's interesting, besides sort of like it as a journal entry, is that it

07:58.040 --> 08:03.560
gets a lot of engagement, right? So 320 comments on the Reddit thread. I'm sure people talked about

08:03.560 --> 08:10.680
it in other contexts as well, where there would have been more comments. And, you know, as someone

08:10.680 --> 08:16.400
who's been working on an open source project for a bunch of years now, enough people have told me

08:16.400 --> 08:21.760
that Elm is going to die next month. That I'm like, I don't think they're right this time. You know,

08:21.760 --> 08:29.880
like I have that fear doesn't speak to me anymore because I have the experience. But there are

08:29.880 --> 08:34.520
other people in the community who don't have that same experience. And like this can be like a

08:34.520 --> 08:39.800
scary thing of like, man, people like aren't liking this thing. Are we doing something wrong? They

08:39.840 --> 08:46.920
feel like maybe it could be better. They might get defensive. So in one of these 320 comments, the

08:46.920 --> 08:53.720
creator of closure says, I found out about this while sitting down to spend my weekend contributing

08:53.720 --> 08:58.880
to the closure ecosystem. Time spent in lieu of spending time with my wife, having already spent

08:58.880 --> 09:05.720
my work week on other closure related stuff. And I relate to this a lot. I've definitely written

09:05.960 --> 09:11.600
like, hey, like we, I get there's different viewpoints, but like we can't yell our viewpoints at

09:11.600 --> 09:18.160
each other. And that was my Saturday. And, you know, as you work over the course of the years,

09:18.160 --> 09:24.560
like, there can only be so many Saturdays that are like that before it starts to hurt you in larger

09:24.560 --> 09:32.760
ways. So Rich Chicky goes on to say, you know, every time I have to process a diatribe like this,

09:32.760 --> 09:36.920
and it's aftermath, the effects on myself, my family and my coworkers, I have to struggle back

09:36.920 --> 09:41.800
from why should I bother? And every time it gets harder to justify to myself and my family that

09:41.800 --> 09:46.920
it's worth the time, energy and emotional burden. Now, I've talked to some people about this post

09:46.920 --> 09:51.720
and they, they thought different things stood out to me. This last part is what stands out,

09:51.720 --> 09:57.960
because I think a lot of people in open source feel this way and like would never say it out loud.

09:57.960 --> 10:03.480
I was really surprised to see it that way. And it kind of gave me some confidence to talk about

10:03.480 --> 10:11.320
that kind of stuff as well. So, you know, we have our posts like this in the Elm community

10:12.600 --> 10:19.320
with a bunch of comments as well. And I see it not just as like, oh man, this is hard for me to

10:19.320 --> 10:23.800
process, but the people I work with have a hard time processing it. And then if you just add up

10:23.800 --> 10:28.120
all the time, let's say maybe 10 minutes is spent on each of these comments, which I think is low,

10:28.120 --> 10:35.320
like a conservative estimate. We're talking about like 50 hours for this one, that's just like

10:35.320 --> 10:42.040
dealing with someone's anger. And could that have been helping someone new or spending time with

10:42.600 --> 10:48.360
some family members or like learning some hobby that could get you out of work and get you like

10:48.360 --> 10:54.360
a more healthy attitude? So, one thing I hear a lot when I talk about this stuff is like, if it

10:54.360 --> 11:05.480
makes you so mad, why don't you just not read it? Why don't you just not read it? So, another pattern

11:05.480 --> 11:12.120
that's really common is that all discussion is constructive. You know, I'm just saying how I

11:12.200 --> 11:19.560
feel. I feel like F you, and I respect you a lot. And you know, I think you're an idiot, but like,

11:19.560 --> 11:25.800
I really learned a lot from you. And like, that's a difficult, like personal relations to have,

11:25.800 --> 11:28.760
I don't know if people have people like that in their life, but that's a difficult thing to deal

11:28.760 --> 11:36.120
with a lot. So, one discussion that was along these lines is like, should Elm have user definable

11:36.120 --> 11:40.920
infix operators? This came up recently with our recent release. And if we just focus on this

11:40.920 --> 11:47.800
question, like textually, someone might say, yeah, there are cases where it makes code shorter

11:47.800 --> 11:53.240
and more convenient. And someone else might say, no, because it can make code harder to read,

11:53.240 --> 11:58.840
especially in a large team. And you know, textually, like, this is an interesting argument. Like,

11:58.840 --> 12:04.200
yeah, it can make coach. That's a good point. And it might hurt people in a large team. And then

12:04.200 --> 12:10.120
onlookers will sort of say, oh, which one seems to make more sense to me? But when you take a step

12:10.120 --> 12:15.320
back and stop thinking of it just as like a textual argument about who is right and who's wrong

12:15.320 --> 12:20.760
and say, okay, all these people have different priorities. Some of them may value flexibility

12:20.760 --> 12:26.840
a lot. And some people might value simplicity a lot. And all these people exist on this

12:27.720 --> 12:30.520
with different priorities. So the person who's like, yeah, we should have this,

12:31.080 --> 12:36.040
really might value flexibility. And the person who says no is saying, well,

12:36.520 --> 12:43.240
if like all these benefits are telling me about flexibility or like how code can be shorter

12:43.240 --> 12:46.760
and more convenient, it's like, that's not persuasive to me. Like, that's not a good

12:46.760 --> 12:52.600
rational argument because it's not important. And likewise, you know, how does it work on

12:52.600 --> 12:56.840
a large team? It's like, well, that doesn't, it doesn't matter. It's not about that. And all the

12:56.840 --> 13:02.440
people exist on this spectrum is with different priorities as well. So they're evaluating it

13:02.440 --> 13:08.440
not as which is the true objective argument, but given my priorities, which is the one that

13:08.440 --> 13:16.600
makes the most sense to me. So I've come to see constructive discussion is about mutual understanding

13:16.600 --> 13:20.920
rather than mutual agreement. And a lot of discussions online are like, we're going to get

13:20.920 --> 13:26.440
to a point where you agree with me rather than saying like, huh, this person's seeing it different.

13:26.440 --> 13:31.720
Why is that maybe they're seeing something I don't. So

13:34.120 --> 13:39.160
when I take a step back and think about these different patterns, I just think like, why,

13:39.160 --> 13:44.520
why is this happening? You know, I don't have problems like this in normal life. You know,

13:44.520 --> 13:53.160
if I'm at an Elm conference or a meetup or like nothing ever is so emotionally difficult as these

13:53.160 --> 13:58.920
interactions. So I found this documentary called All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace by

13:58.920 --> 14:05.880
Adam Curtis. It's excellent as is all of his work. And that sort of taught me or I found through that

14:05.880 --> 14:12.520
a book called From Counterculture to Cyberculture. So this revealed to me a sort of an intellectual

14:12.520 --> 14:18.120
history going back to the 1950s that really helps explain what's going on in open source right now.

14:18.760 --> 14:28.920
So it traces things from a book called The Human Use of Human Beings. So this came out of MIT in

14:28.920 --> 14:36.840
like 1952 by a person who had created artillery that could automatically track planes and shoot them

14:36.840 --> 14:44.360
down. And then the whole earth catalog, which was popular in the back to the land movement. So

14:44.440 --> 14:47.880
a lot of people on communes might have bought this, but it was a much larger thing than that.

14:48.760 --> 14:52.520
And then finally the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and it sort of ties these together in a very

14:52.520 --> 14:58.520
interesting way. So we'll look at some of the things going on here. So in The Human Use of Human

14:58.520 --> 15:06.760
Beings, Norbert Weiner introduces the idea of cybernetics. He defines it as the study of messages

15:06.760 --> 15:17.480
as a means of controlling machinery and society. So it's a little weird. Okay, okay, fine. And as

15:17.480 --> 15:23.480
you start to read it, it's like this way of like, let's not look at the person, but let's look at the

15:23.480 --> 15:28.120
messages going around, and that's how we'll think about how the world works. And so you see things

15:28.120 --> 15:34.360
like words such as life, purpose, and soul are grossly inadequate to precise scientific thinking,

15:35.080 --> 15:40.600
which is it's like fair enough, but also like those things like life and purpose are like

15:41.560 --> 15:50.200
pretty important to people as well to consider. But you know, a person's just a special sort of

15:50.200 --> 15:55.880
machine, right? Like we can consider it as a thing that takes inputs and does stuff. Emotions are

15:55.880 --> 16:05.000
just a useless epiphenomenon. That's real. He said that. Another thing he's like, we have

16:05.000 --> 16:09.160
modified our environment so radically that we must now modify ourselves in order to exist in

16:09.160 --> 16:14.680
this new environment. So it's sort of how can we take a person and simplify it down to a machine

16:14.680 --> 16:20.920
or a system that we can understand well? And then once we're starting to think of people that way,

16:20.920 --> 16:24.680
well, we can improve machines. We can add things to them and the machines get more

16:24.680 --> 16:31.240
capabilities. Maybe that's how we move forward as people. And life and purpose is like that.

16:32.200 --> 16:39.880
We can't go back to that. It's too different now. So the sort of connecting thread and whole

16:39.880 --> 16:45.640
earth catalog besides Stuart Brand, the author of this knowing a bunch of the people in the

16:45.640 --> 16:54.680
cybernetics group, is this idea of access to tools, right? So like we are now, our relationship

16:54.680 --> 17:00.440
with our tools is going to be how we move forward. So this catalog starts with we are as gods and

17:00.440 --> 17:06.920
we might as well get good at it. So far, remotely done power and glory as government, big business,

17:06.920 --> 17:12.360
formal education, church has succeeded to the point where the gross defects obscure actual gains.

17:12.680 --> 17:22.440
In response, personal power is developing. So he's focused on a bunch of different topics.

17:23.560 --> 17:30.200
And so education, finding inspiration, shaping his environment, sharing the adventure. Now,

17:30.200 --> 17:34.280
keep in mind this is written in 1969. So this is before the internet. And if you read these

17:34.280 --> 17:39.320
points as like what an ideal view of the internet should be, it works really well. Like you can

17:39.320 --> 17:45.160
find out all sorts of interesting stuff. You can be inspired by what's going on out there. You can

17:45.160 --> 17:49.640
find a place where you really fit in, even if you don't fit in, in your local community that has

17:49.640 --> 17:56.200
different values than you. And you can share that with whoever you want to. Like there's this place

17:56.200 --> 18:01.640
for self-expression. And so he says tools that aid this process are sought and promoted by the

18:01.640 --> 18:07.160
whole earth catalog. So some people have argued that this is sort of like the what preceded the

18:07.160 --> 18:13.480
internet. It sort of foresaw what was going to happen there. And this publication and the

18:13.480 --> 18:18.920
creator, Stuart Brand, had been really influential. So one of the positive quotes is when I was young,

18:18.920 --> 18:22.440
there was an amazing publication called the whole earth catalog, which was one of the

18:22.440 --> 18:30.120
Bibles of my generation. So that was Steve Jobs. There was a project that Stuart Brand created

18:30.120 --> 18:37.480
called the 10,000 year clock, which Jeff Bezos helped fund with $42 million. So what is this,

18:37.480 --> 18:43.880
like this book that was popular on back to the land communes, became very influential because of this

18:44.680 --> 18:51.960
how tools and like a rejection of hierarchy, we're somehow in this new place where we're

18:51.960 --> 18:57.240
going to choose our own future through our connection with tools. And finally, the electronic

18:57.320 --> 19:01.880
frontier foundation. Interestingly, the founders of this met on the whole earth

19:01.880 --> 19:08.840
electronic link, one of the earliest bullet or message boards. And so one of the founders

19:08.840 --> 19:14.040
wrote the declaration of independence of cyberspace, governments of the industrial world,

19:14.040 --> 19:20.280
you weary giants of flesh and steel, you have no sovereignty where we gather. I declare the global

19:20.280 --> 19:25.560
space, social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on

19:25.560 --> 19:31.560
us. So again, you see this like distrust of hierarchy, big businesses failed, government has

19:31.560 --> 19:37.000
failed. We are going to find a new way through this thing. So one of the early cases that the

19:37.000 --> 19:42.600
electronic frontier foundation that inspired the creation of this foundation was there was a

19:42.600 --> 19:51.080
programmer called Lloyd Blankenship. And Bell South found that some of their 911 alert system

19:51.080 --> 19:55.640
documentation had been posted on a bulletin board. And so they got the secret service involved

19:55.640 --> 20:01.480
and took some computers that might have sensitive information. So Lloyd was arrested and the

20:01.480 --> 20:06.520
electronic frontier foundation like was created around that time to help protect people in the

20:06.520 --> 20:12.280
situation. So after Lloyd was arrested, he wrote something called the hackers manifesto,

20:13.560 --> 20:19.080
which I think gives a raw version of what's going on in this world. So he says,

20:19.880 --> 20:23.640
I'm smarter than most of the other kids. This crap they teach us bores me.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.200
I've listened to my teacher explain for the 15th time how to reduce a fraction.

20:28.200 --> 20:31.560
I understand it. No, Miss Smith, I didn't show my work. I did it in my head.

20:33.400 --> 20:42.440
And you can see, well, he says, I made a discovery today. I found a computer. It does what I

20:42.440 --> 20:47.720
want it to do. If I make a mistake, it's because I screwed up, not because it doesn't like me,

20:47.800 --> 20:52.520
or it feels threatened by me, or it thinks I'm a smart ass, or it doesn't like teaching and

20:52.520 --> 20:58.360
shouldn't be here. So you're seeing this, this guy is 21 when he's writing this. He's somebody

20:58.360 --> 21:03.400
sort of very disillusioned, not just with government or big business, but like just his

21:03.400 --> 21:09.400
classroom, the social environment he's living in. And he goes on to say, this is our world now.

21:09.400 --> 21:13.400
We explore, but you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, wage wars.

21:14.040 --> 21:17.720
You try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.

21:19.560 --> 21:24.600
So again, you see that explicit distrust of hierarchy. And then finally,

21:24.600 --> 21:28.200
my crime is that of outsmarting you, something you will never forgive me for.

21:30.040 --> 21:34.760
So I don't know how many people who work on open source will recognize aspects of this attitude

21:34.760 --> 21:42.360
and interactions they have. But there's sort of such a strong rejection of the social things

21:42.440 --> 21:47.400
going on. It's like, well, the teacher who's not teaching you well has a bunch of other students,

21:47.400 --> 21:52.680
and it's difficult to balance all their needs. Maybe it's malicious, but maybe there's another

21:52.680 --> 21:58.440
reason. But this worldview is kind of like, I outsmarted you. You don't see it how I see it.

21:59.080 --> 22:06.760
So when I take a step back on this intellectual pathway, the things I sort of draw out from

22:06.760 --> 22:14.200
reading these books and things is, one, we're gods. Two, hierarchy has failed us. There's

22:14.200 --> 22:19.640
sort of a deep distrust of hierarchical structures. I think rightly, there's a lot of bad things that

22:19.640 --> 22:26.920
come out of hierarchy. And finally, order will emerge from the new technology. So when we reconsider

22:26.920 --> 22:32.760
the patterns we've seen open source, stuff makes a lot of sense. So it's like, why don't you just?

22:32.760 --> 22:38.840
It's like, haven't you, we can just, through reason and rationality, figure out the answer.

22:38.840 --> 22:44.360
Why don't you just do the obvious thing? Hierarchy has failed us. So again, on whose

22:44.360 --> 22:49.160
authority is coming out of this tradition of hierarchical structures haven't served us well.

22:49.160 --> 22:54.040
We need to find a way that isn't structured in that way. Your authority as the author

22:56.040 --> 23:01.240
is not legitimate on those grounds. And all discussion is constructive. It's like, well,

23:02.040 --> 23:06.200
this is the new technology. This is what the new technology is producing. So this must be

23:07.080 --> 23:15.080
the way forward to this place that we want to go. So I found this pathway really interesting,

23:15.080 --> 23:20.040
and it informed, like, it helped me understand a lot what was going on. But it's just one of

23:20.040 --> 23:25.320
a couple of different ways of looking at how we got to this level of conflict in open source.

23:25.320 --> 23:32.760
So I'm calling this sort of the intellectual issue of freedom. People are primarily prioritizing

23:32.760 --> 23:37.720
freedom. But there are other ones, such as people who are primarily prioritizing engagement.

23:38.600 --> 23:44.680
So I want to start with a quote, the enormous expansion of communications has entirely transformed

23:44.680 --> 23:49.080
the conditions of trade and commerce. Everything is done in haste at fever pitch. The night is

23:49.080 --> 23:53.640
used for travel, the day for business, even holiday trips put strain on the nervous system.

23:54.360 --> 23:59.800
And do people relate to that? Holiday trips being stressful? I feel that. Or I struggle with that,

23:59.800 --> 24:10.200
at least. I try to take a break or whatever. Great political, industrial, and financial crises

24:10.200 --> 24:14.040
carry this segment into far wider areas of the population than ever before.

24:14.040 --> 24:18.120
Interest in political life has become universal. Tempers are inflamed by political, religious,

24:18.120 --> 24:23.560
and social struggles, party politics, electioneering. Sound familiar to anybody?

24:26.680 --> 24:30.120
Finally, people are forced to engage in a constant mental activity and robbed of the

24:30.120 --> 24:34.360
time needed for relaxation, sleep, and rest. So if you had to guess when this was written,

24:35.480 --> 24:40.280
it's reasonable. It could be this year, it could be 2017, or maybe someone was really

24:40.280 --> 24:44.040
prophetic and they wrote it in like 1980. It's like, I see where this is all going.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.200
So this is actually from something Freud wrote in 1902.

24:49.560 --> 24:55.000
The part I left out is due to the worldwide telegraph and telephone networks

24:56.040 --> 25:02.920
and the immense growth of trade unionism. So I mean, I think it makes sense that he would

25:02.920 --> 25:06.760
have seen these kinds of things. He seems like a smart dude, or at least someone who's very

25:06.760 --> 25:14.360
sensitive to human behavior. And so this is kind of where this intellectual history starts.

25:14.360 --> 25:19.000
So we have Freud, but we're going to look at two other books. One is called Propaganda

25:19.000 --> 25:25.720
from 1928, and one is called Nudge, much more recent from 2008. So with Propaganda,

25:25.720 --> 25:30.600
this is written by Edward Bernays. This is actually Freud's nephew. The connections between

25:30.600 --> 25:36.840
all these works are crazy. And as you look into any parts of these, like everybody met,

25:36.840 --> 25:40.840
everybody worked with someone's nephew or cousin or mom, or it's very strange.

25:42.840 --> 25:46.920
So this book is essentially a bunch of stories about how Edward Bernays sort of created the

25:46.920 --> 25:51.400
idea of public relations. So one of the stories he tells is about torches of freedom.

25:52.600 --> 25:57.960
So this was an ad campaign to break the taboo against women smoking. At the time men would

25:57.960 --> 26:04.040
smoke, and it was acceptable to some degree, and women couldn't. It was very looked down upon.

26:05.320 --> 26:11.640
So the president of the American Tobacco Company said, if we can break this taboo,

26:11.640 --> 26:17.000
it'll be like a gold mine opening right in our front yard. So he hires Edward Bernays.

26:17.800 --> 26:24.440
And what Edward Bernays does is he hires women who are good looking, but not too modally. That's

26:24.440 --> 26:28.920
the quote I found good looking, but not too modally. To walk in an Easter Sunday parade

26:28.920 --> 26:34.360
and smoke, he also hired photographers to get really good photos of these women,

26:34.360 --> 26:38.840
and then distributed those photos to newspaper, like through newspaper connections that he had

26:38.840 --> 26:46.600
to make sure it got published all around the world. So this torches of freedom idea was saying,

26:46.600 --> 26:53.240
we see this trend about women's liberation happening, and like this is aligned with that

26:53.240 --> 27:00.040
movement, and that this is a way of punching up against those taboos. But it's very focused on

27:00.040 --> 27:04.600
like, hey, we're going to sell a bunch, we're going to make a bunch of money here. And so one of the

27:04.600 --> 27:10.520
ads that came out of this was an ancient precious has been removed. And what's interesting about

27:10.520 --> 27:17.960
this ad is that visually it's clearly about women smoking, but texturally it's saying toasting did

27:18.040 --> 27:24.600
it. It's because they toast the tobacco, it's less harsh on your throat, and that's what has

27:24.600 --> 27:30.920
removed the prejudice. So texturally, they can say, look, we're not getting into politics. We're

27:30.920 --> 27:36.760
just saying that toasting is cool, and that's a lady who smokes. It's like, I don't see the problem.

27:37.400 --> 27:44.360
But meanwhile, you have hired Edward Bernays to actually run this campaign. So, oh yeah,

27:44.440 --> 27:50.280
I want to read a little bit from his book. This is the book. He says, the old-fashioned

27:50.280 --> 27:56.120
propagandist using almost exclusively the appeal to the printed word tried to persuade the individual

27:56.120 --> 28:04.760
reader to buy a definite article immediately. So his example of this is like, you buy O'Leary's

28:04.760 --> 28:12.280
rubber bands now. And he's like, okay, that's the old-fashioned way. The modern propagandist

28:12.280 --> 28:17.880
therefore sets to work to create the circumstances that will modify the custom. It doesn't matter

28:17.880 --> 28:23.480
what this ad says. It's about creating circumstances such that the custom will change in whatever

28:23.480 --> 28:29.640
direction someone pays me to change it. So another example he gives is for Mozart pianos.

28:30.200 --> 28:35.000
So I don't know exactly the finances of Mozart pianos, but let's say they had 30% of market share

28:35.720 --> 28:41.000
and he gets hired to make it higher. Maybe it can go to 35 or 40. That'd be a huge for Mozart

28:41.000 --> 28:47.320
pianos. So Bernays comes in and he says, okay, I could say to people, will you please buy a piano,

28:47.320 --> 28:54.440
but I'm not going to do that. I know that pianos have this sort of elite cachet. And so what I'm

28:54.440 --> 29:00.040
going to do is I want to make an architecture expo in New York City where we're going to showcase

29:00.040 --> 29:06.600
music parlors and we're going to bring in famous people, influential artists and musicians to

29:06.600 --> 29:12.360
be in the rooms. We're going to have expensive tapestries and really lean into this elite picture

29:12.360 --> 29:18.680
and promote it in our connections with newspapers. He also invites architects from all over the

29:18.680 --> 29:24.280
country. He wants influential architects and they'll bring designs for music parlors. So what this

29:24.280 --> 29:31.160
expo does is it creates a music parlor as an aspirational goal and it brings in architects

29:31.160 --> 29:35.960
who will then go back to wherever they're from with designs for music parlors and they'll start

29:35.960 --> 29:40.600
building houses that have that. And ideally they'll influence other architects who are not as

29:40.600 --> 29:46.680
influential to add music parlors as well. And so instead of saying, hey, will you please buy this

29:46.680 --> 29:50.520
piano, people are now saying, hey, I have this piano shaped hole that I need to fill. Like,

29:50.520 --> 29:58.600
do you have something piano shaped? So again, the modern propagandist sets to work to create

29:58.600 --> 30:03.880
the circumstances that will modify the custom. So this got modernized and sort of made a bit

30:03.880 --> 30:11.160
nicer in nudge. So here we see a nudge is any aspect of a choice architecture that will alter

30:11.160 --> 30:15.720
people's behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing

30:15.720 --> 30:23.080
their economic incentives. So this book has been really influential in tech recently. So one thing

30:23.080 --> 30:29.480
that we're probably all familiar that's an example of this is autoplay of videos. So you just finished

30:30.120 --> 30:36.920
a show. It ends on a cliffhanger because they wrote it that way. And you're like, man, that was

30:36.920 --> 30:48.600
cool. And then you're like, oh, my body. Is it hungry? Does it need a walk? Did it have plans

30:49.320 --> 30:57.720
for today? Or for anything? And then the music starts again and you're like, no, no.

31:00.680 --> 31:06.840
So this is a nudge, right? You're free to do some other behavior, but through the choice

31:06.840 --> 31:12.360
architecture that was created, a predictable amount of people don't make that free choice.

31:13.320 --> 31:19.240
So this ended up being popular at Google. So if anyone's visited Google cafeterias, you'll

31:19.240 --> 31:24.600
probably have seen all the food is marked with colors. So green means eat anytime. Yellow means

31:24.600 --> 31:28.920
once in a while. Red means not often, please. And it's all marked. It's actually very helpful.

31:29.960 --> 31:35.960
You can be like, oh, I just had one red thing today. It's kind of nice. But this interest in

31:36.440 --> 31:42.680
colors changing people's behavior was used to Google in other ways. So when you look at the

31:42.680 --> 31:49.560
history of their ad labeling, you see something similar. So when ads started, they sort of just

31:49.560 --> 31:57.640
start by playing around with colors. It's like, well, maybe green is fun. Or maybe this lavender,

31:57.640 --> 32:03.480
purple thing is the way to go. So in a new phase of things, you start to see, okay, well, let's

32:03.560 --> 32:10.920
do something more white. Can it be something more white? Yeah, maybe a little more white, you know?

32:13.720 --> 32:17.080
Well, how about something like a little more white? Like, all this color is like,

32:17.080 --> 32:20.760
let's just put it in one place. We'll take all the saturation, put it in one place.

32:22.040 --> 32:29.400
And like, hey, it works fine. No problem. And then it's like, well, that yellow is pretty ugly.

32:29.960 --> 32:35.480
We could just, you know, it's still labeled. It's no problem. And then it's like, I mean,

32:36.680 --> 32:42.360
who wanted it to be yellow? And I mean, it wasn't really that important. And then it's like, you

32:42.360 --> 32:54.680
know, the background, I mean, people get it. They get it. So when you search for Italy tour, for

32:54.680 --> 33:02.840
example, everything above the fold is an ad and it's labeled in this very, you know, subtle and

33:02.840 --> 33:10.440
nice way. So I found this very interesting quote from the head of text ads at Google. He says,

33:10.440 --> 33:15.560
we want to make it easier for our users to adjust information on the page. So we're gradually trying

33:15.560 --> 33:19.880
to reduce the number of variations of colors and patterns on the page and bring a little bit more

33:19.880 --> 33:28.520
harmony to the page. Like, we just want harmony. And that's why we reduced one of the color

33:28.520 --> 33:33.160
elements on the page. We could have reduced other color elements. Yeah, it's just one color element.

33:33.160 --> 33:39.480
Like, what's the big deal? So some of you may be thinking, like, Evan, if you're so mad about this,

33:39.480 --> 33:45.640
you know, why don't you just change your default search? Like, you typed it into Safari, so clearly

33:45.640 --> 33:52.040
that's the default. Well, another thing I learned when I was looking into this is Google paid $1

33:52.040 --> 33:56.840
billion to Apple to keep the search bar on iPhones. Furthermore, these sums called traffic

33:56.840 --> 34:05.480
acquisition costs rose to $5.5 billion or 23% of ad revenue. So we're in a situation where

34:07.960 --> 34:14.360
a choice architecture has been created, you know, the circumstances have been modified such that,

34:14.360 --> 34:19.960
you know, well, I don't mind searching in this way, or I could scroll down below these ads,

34:19.960 --> 34:25.640
but I don't really want to. So the circumstances have been created such that custom is modified.

34:25.640 --> 34:29.960
And if we wanted to mess with this, like, it's going to cost a lot of money, right? The fact that I,

34:29.960 --> 34:33.800
that DuckDuckDog exists doesn't mean that they can compete with these kinds of

34:34.360 --> 34:44.760
numbers. So I think this whole intellectual lineage leads to something that we see in online

34:45.320 --> 34:51.240
communities a lot, which is like this, things are viral by design. So when Bernays starts an

34:51.240 --> 34:55.880
advertising campaign, all these stories he tells, he always starts with a psychological hook. So

34:55.880 --> 35:01.160
you might observe that people process emotions by sharing them with others. So that might look like,

35:01.240 --> 35:06.280
you know, someone's going about their day, it's fine. And someone shows up and they're like,

35:06.280 --> 35:11.000
that work you did last week, it was terrible. Like, it's not going to work out. It was really not

35:11.000 --> 35:17.880
carefully considered. And that person feels sad. And that person goes, the person yelling at them

35:17.880 --> 35:24.520
goes away. So they might mope around for a day or however long. And hopefully they run into a friend

35:24.520 --> 35:28.840
who hears this story and they're like, oh man, that sucks. But, you know, I don't think that was

35:28.840 --> 35:34.760
really a fair assessment. And through talking it through, the person can sort of deal with that

35:34.760 --> 35:39.960
and move through. Another interaction that might be possible is you're going about your day and

35:39.960 --> 35:44.120
someone says, did you hear about that terrible thing that's happening over there? And you say,

35:44.120 --> 35:48.680
whoa, that's terrible. And then you see a friend and you say, hey, did you hear about that? And

35:48.680 --> 35:52.280
they're like, oh, that's terrible. And they see some of their friends and they're like, man, that

35:52.360 --> 36:04.120
thing over there is really bad. Viral. So when we're choosing what kind of messages we want to

36:04.120 --> 36:11.560
put into society to control it, as the cyberneticist might say, this one has a very interesting

36:11.560 --> 36:16.360
pattern. So when you get something that has a viral reaction, that's something that has more

36:16.360 --> 36:23.480
engagement. And a lot of people who are running Silicon Valley companies in an idealistic way,

36:23.480 --> 36:28.200
you know, they want to make the world better through tools, they're put in this choice architecture

36:28.200 --> 36:31.960
where it's like you have, you know, these investors and you don't want to disappoint them. There's

36:31.960 --> 36:36.600
all these people who work at your company, you don't want to lay them off. So do you want hashtag

36:36.600 --> 36:44.200
disappointing Q3? Or do you want the viral one? So once you have this psychological hook, you can

36:44.200 --> 36:49.880
start designing ways to make it work better. So the ones I sort of noticed have been to mix

36:49.880 --> 36:55.080
extremes. So if we come back to our priorities graph of different people, these people don't

36:55.080 --> 36:59.320
necessarily congregate in the same place. But what we really want to happen is for the most

36:59.320 --> 37:06.760
extreme people to yell at each other as aggressively as possible. And so one way to do that might be

37:06.760 --> 37:10.200
to put all the different programming communities in one place.

37:14.680 --> 37:21.160
So if you look at sort of different online discussion forums, I think the degree to which

37:21.160 --> 37:25.960
different communities collide will predict the amount of conflict that you see there. So on

37:25.960 --> 37:32.680
Hacker News, I find that the sort of most difficult and most combative place. And then on the R

37:32.680 --> 37:37.880
programming, you'll see more of that. And on the subreddits for individual languages, you'll see

37:37.880 --> 37:43.960
less on places that are just community places that don't have accounts that are shared between

37:43.960 --> 37:52.040
you'll see less. So another approach is to decontextualize the person. So instead of two people

37:52.040 --> 37:58.120
talking, you have Tango dango talking to Foxtrot. And what's interesting here is like when they

37:58.120 --> 38:02.440
saw each other's faces, they might be able to say, oh, this person isn't trying to be malicious.

38:02.440 --> 38:08.200
They feel this way. But when it's Tango dango, it could literally be Hitler. It could.

38:10.520 --> 38:15.320
You don't know. He's just in Argentina being like, infix operators are stupid.

38:17.720 --> 38:25.640
Unclean. So another way to decontextualize things is to limit the amount of characters

38:25.640 --> 38:30.600
that are available to people. Another way is to limit the kind of feedback that's available.

38:30.600 --> 38:37.320
So instead of saying, hey, that was pretty hurtful, you say down. Like a lot of nuance is lost in

38:37.320 --> 38:44.600
that sort of thing. So when I take a step back on all this, I think there's a big conflict here

38:44.600 --> 38:51.320
where there's very powerful incentives for our interactions to go really poorly. And I don't

38:51.320 --> 38:57.320
think the intellectual issue of freedom really is well set up to protect against that. Like if

38:57.320 --> 39:02.520
you are living in a choice architecture that predictably alters people's behavior, yeah, you

39:02.520 --> 39:07.240
were given a free choice, but you happen to choose a different thing 30% of the time.

39:08.920 --> 39:14.360
So this got me interested in a different pathway. So I ask a lot, why don't I have any of these

39:14.360 --> 39:20.120
problems in person? So like at work or at conferences or at meetups or on the street,

39:22.520 --> 39:28.040
all these places are for something. So when a place is for something, you can ask what's

39:28.040 --> 39:33.240
inappropriate behavior. If I'm at work and a discussion keeps going and going, at some point

39:33.240 --> 39:37.160
it's like we have to stop having the discussion and make a choice. We can't be in discussion forever.

39:37.160 --> 39:45.480
It's clear because of work is for work. And at a conference, it's against the norms to jump

39:45.480 --> 39:50.440
up on a stage and being like, that's wrong. The idea is like you carefully select speakers who

39:50.440 --> 39:56.120
might have something interesting to say to folks and try to efficiently and in a nice way present

39:56.120 --> 40:01.400
that. At a meetup, if someone's being really aggressive, they're always like, oh, I need to go

40:01.400 --> 40:07.400
to the bathroom. There's ways out of those kinds of conflicts or and you're talking face to face

40:07.400 --> 40:12.200
on the street, you know, someone's like standing outside Starbucks and being like, I had better

40:12.200 --> 40:23.240
coffee one time. It's like that's weird. That's weird behavior. And then and the croissants could

40:23.240 --> 40:33.800
be done better. I don't know how, but they could. This isn't it. So this idea of like a place being

40:33.800 --> 40:39.160
for something I think is really important. And so I had this idea for intentional communication.

40:39.160 --> 40:43.160
And so the idea is that instead of just having a blank box you write into, you first choose

40:43.160 --> 40:48.440
some intent. My intent is to learn, let's say. And I'll get prompted to say, okay, what's your

40:48.440 --> 40:52.520
background? Maybe they started using Elm and they've been doing Java for a long time. And the

40:52.520 --> 40:57.960
question is, why do I have to explicitly cast between int and float when doing math? And then I

40:57.960 --> 41:03.960
can submit the post. So when that shows up, this question might have been read in a combative way.

41:03.960 --> 41:09.960
Like, why do I have to explicitly cast between int and float when doing math? Or like, why do I have

41:09.960 --> 41:15.240
to explicitly cast between? Like, both of those are valid interpretations of this text. But when

41:15.240 --> 41:19.640
you give some background, it's like, okay, I see where this person is coming from. I can see why

41:19.640 --> 41:24.120
they'd be frustrated with that. And it's really harder to read it in a malicious way. So instead

41:24.120 --> 41:29.160
of just having a reply button, maybe you can say, okay, I can either ask for clarification or I can

41:29.160 --> 41:36.360
give an answer. And so if I say, I'm going to give an answer, again, we might have this structured way

41:36.360 --> 41:44.520
of replying. Restate the question, answer it, and then we can say, hey, we value citations. We value

41:44.520 --> 41:48.680
like people backing up with evidence or experience. So maybe they give a citation and they can post

41:48.680 --> 41:54.760
it. And so again, you get the answer. And the person asking says, oh, that's not the question I was

41:54.760 --> 42:02.600
asking, actually. So that can really help clarify and make this process more efficient. So again,

42:02.600 --> 42:08.760
instead of reply, maybe you say, ask for clarification or thank the person. And so there's a couple

42:08.760 --> 42:13.560
of things you can add to this I think that would help. So one is the idea of conversation flows.

42:13.560 --> 42:17.800
So we saw someone wants to learn, you can clarify or answer. If you choose to answer,

42:17.800 --> 42:24.200
they can ask a clarifying question or thank you. Now if they clarify, maybe you give another answer.

42:25.240 --> 42:30.520
But in the other pathways, say, hey, maybe can you give me an example to clarify your question?

42:31.160 --> 42:37.160
They can restate it and then you can answer. So the point here is just that yell angrily isn't one

42:37.240 --> 42:45.320
of the states in the discussion flow. It's unreachable. So this isn't to say that all discussion

42:45.320 --> 42:49.400
should be this way. Because there are places where you want self-expression. You say, hey,

42:49.400 --> 42:52.360
I had a really nice time at the park. Here's a photo of it. And someone says, oh, that's great.

42:52.360 --> 42:57.480
That reminds me of last week we were clicking something really nice. And so you can have these

42:57.480 --> 43:02.760
cycles. But when someone's doing self-expression, you say, man, that's really like a terrible thing

43:02.760 --> 43:07.160
to say. Maybe you could have a conversation flow that says, hey, I want to learn about that

43:07.160 --> 43:10.520
perspective. I don't want to tell you it's wrong. I just want to know why you feel that way.

43:11.640 --> 43:17.000
So what might be interesting here is the discussion flows will be different depending

43:17.000 --> 43:20.520
on the goals of the community. If it's about learning, it might be one way. If it's about

43:20.520 --> 43:25.640
self-expression, it might be another way. And maybe you want safety valves to jump around.

43:25.640 --> 43:29.640
So another thing that I think is interesting is say discussion is happening and it's getting

43:29.640 --> 43:34.040
really out of control. And it's like, hey, this is nice. And then by the end, they're like,

43:34.600 --> 43:42.280
your mom is a bad person. And she threw a bicycle on the ground. I don't know.

43:44.040 --> 43:48.600
So this is where you don't really want things to go. So one thing that might be interesting is

43:48.600 --> 43:53.080
when you see someone about to reply, say, hey, what would be a successful conclusion to this

43:53.080 --> 43:58.840
interaction? Or would it be easier to chat for five minutes? Is there somewhere to take this

43:58.840 --> 44:03.480
that's going to be more constructive? Like, what do you want to get out of this? Another thing that

44:03.480 --> 44:08.920
might be really valuable. So we talked about private feed or sorry, upvote, downvote stuff.

44:09.560 --> 44:13.400
When someone gets downvoted, they say, they think to themselves, these people who just can't take

44:13.400 --> 44:19.320
it, you know, I outsmarted them and they can't accept that. But the people might actually be

44:19.320 --> 44:23.800
saying, man, that was pretty rude and uncalled for. And so that feedback is not reaching that person

44:23.800 --> 44:28.520
and they feel increasingly alienated by these kinds of reactions. Furthermore, these buttons

44:28.520 --> 44:34.200
sort of uniquely pick out like, ah, I'm mad. Oh, I like that. So what we might be able to do instead

44:34.200 --> 44:39.320
is say, hey, for any post, here's a couple of things that you might notice about it. Is it off

44:39.320 --> 44:45.480
topic? Is it helpful? And if the goal of the place is to help professionals, maybe these are the ones

44:45.480 --> 44:49.320
you want to choose. But if the goal is helping beginners, maybe you want to choose scary versus

44:49.320 --> 44:54.920
encouraging or confusing versus clear. And if the place is about self-expression, maybe you want

44:55.000 --> 45:01.640
to choose funny and downer. So there's a bunch of extras. I'm running out of time, so I'm going to

45:01.640 --> 45:07.640
skip. But there's a lot of cool things to do here. So some people may be looking at this and thinking,

45:08.840 --> 45:14.760
if a planned culture necessarily meant uniform, like, hey, like, all this planning is going to ruin

45:15.400 --> 45:21.080
these communities. So I found this book, it says, if planned culture necessarily meant uniformity

45:21.080 --> 45:25.640
and regimentation, it might indeed work against further evolution. If men were very much alike,

45:25.640 --> 45:29.640
they would be less likely to hit upon or design new practices. And a culture which made people as

45:29.640 --> 45:33.400
much alike as possible might slip into a standard pattern from which there would be no escape.

45:34.120 --> 45:39.080
That would be bad design. But if we are looking for a variety, we should not fall back on accident.

45:39.080 --> 45:44.040
Many accidental cultures have been marked by uniformity and regimentation. So this is from a

45:44.040 --> 45:49.160
book called Beyond Freedom and Dignity by B.F. Skinner. And I think this is one of the clearest

45:49.160 --> 45:53.880
books that's sort of recognizing that there are these people who understand choice architectures

45:53.880 --> 45:59.000
and that freedom doesn't help you escape from choice architectures. Like, design of other

45:59.000 --> 46:05.480
choice architectures is a way to deal with that. So ultimately, I'm not here to say, like, here's

46:05.480 --> 46:09.240
one way that's right or the others. It's like, people are going to have different priorities

46:09.240 --> 46:14.360
depending on, you know, their life and their experiences. I think the point that's important

46:14.360 --> 46:19.560
is that there's a lot of people in open source communities who are getting hurt, right? So like,

46:19.560 --> 46:23.960
it's hard emotionally to work on these kinds of projects. You see people around you getting hurt.

46:23.960 --> 46:28.840
And just saying, well, people are just expressing themselves isn't solving the question. And we

46:28.840 --> 46:34.600
have these very influential people controlling billions of dollars who have particular goals

46:34.600 --> 46:39.800
for what happens in these communities. So I hope that's an interesting way to think about

46:39.800 --> 46:44.040
the hard parts of open source. And I have a bunch of references if you're interested in looking

46:44.040 --> 46:50.200
back on things. And I hope people will explore through programming, like creating the communities

46:50.200 --> 46:57.000
that we kind of talked about. Maybe exploring intentional communication. And maybe it will

46:57.000 --> 47:01.720
be beautiful. Maybe people won't use it. Maybe people will use it. And then it will just become

47:01.720 --> 47:08.280
another tool for engagement. It's likely. We'll see. But thank you very much for your attention

47:08.280 --> 47:09.320
and consideration.
