00:00.000 --> 00:08.080
Chapter 1.

00:08.080 --> 00:11.320
What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.

00:11.320 --> 00:15.280
The immune system is a gift of evolutionary engineering.

00:15.280 --> 00:20.960
It can't possibly anticipate all the pathogens and parasites a child will come across, so

00:20.960 --> 00:25.480
it is designed to learn rapidly from early experience.

00:25.480 --> 00:31.000
The immune system is a sophisticated adaptive system, one that can adapt and grow with a

00:31.000 --> 00:33.400
change in the environment.

00:33.400 --> 00:39.000
This is the underlying explanation for what is called the Hygiene Hypothesis, the leading

00:39.000 --> 00:44.920
definition of why allergy rates naturally go up as countries get wealthier and cleaner,

00:44.920 --> 00:47.880
a case of the dangers of growth.

00:47.880 --> 00:53.920
Of course, Friedrich Nietzsche's original quote, What doesn't kill me makes me stronger,

00:53.920 --> 00:57.040
is not entirely true of taken literally.

00:57.040 --> 01:03.240
Some experiences that don't kill you can leave you forever scarred and weakened.

01:03.240 --> 01:06.160
Fragility is a direct function of status.

01:06.160 --> 01:11.920
Children in third world countries daily brave the elements, but such an exposure may kill

01:11.920 --> 01:15.080
another from affluent climes.

01:15.080 --> 01:20.200
Teaching kids that setbacks, ridicule and unfortunate occurrences will cause lasting

01:20.200 --> 01:22.800
destruction is dangerous.

01:22.800 --> 01:28.480
Muscles need physical and mental challenges and stressors, or we disintegrate.

01:28.480 --> 01:33.080
For instance, muscles and joints need stressors to evolve appropriately.

01:33.080 --> 01:38.800
Too much rest causes muscles to weaken, joints to lose the span of motion, heart and lung

01:38.800 --> 01:42.720
capacity to wane, and blood clots to form.

01:42.720 --> 01:47.600
Without the challenges produced by gravity, astronauts develop muscle weakness and joint

01:47.600 --> 01:49.600
degeneration.

01:49.600 --> 01:56.920
Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the Lebanese-born statistician and stock trader Polymath, who is now a professor

01:56.920 --> 02:02.680
of risk engineering at New York University, explains the harm of avoiding stressors,

02:02.680 --> 02:05.360
dangers and small doses of pain.

02:05.360 --> 02:11.040
In 2017, he published a bestseller titled The Black Swan.

02:11.040 --> 02:15.360
Professor Taleb claimed that most of us think about risk wrongly.

02:15.360 --> 02:21.520
In complex systems, unforeseen situations will certainly arise, yet we continue to assess

02:21.520 --> 02:24.880
risk due to our past or deals.

02:24.880 --> 02:28.840
Life has a way of springing up shocking occurrences.

02:28.840 --> 02:32.280
Situations Taleb relates to the appearance of a black swan.

02:32.280 --> 02:36.720
Based on experience, you assumed that all swans were white.

02:36.720 --> 02:43.200
To better understand how society drifted towards fragility and what can be done to recover

02:43.200 --> 03:08.000
our emotional and intellectual boldness, endeavor to read this summary to the end.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.320
Chapter 2 The untruth of emotional reasoning.

03:12.320 --> 03:15.080
Always trust your feelings.

03:15.080 --> 03:20.560
In the happiness hypothesis, Jonathan Haid drew on the teachings of Buddha and other

03:20.560 --> 03:26.480
philosophers to offer the analogy that the mind is divided into fractions that sometimes

03:26.480 --> 03:31.160
conflict like a small rider sitting on top of a large elephant.

03:31.160 --> 03:34.360
The rider symbolizes conscious processes.

03:34.360 --> 03:40.040
For years, language-based thoughts occupy our conscious minds and we are in control to

03:40.040 --> 03:41.560
some degree.

03:41.560 --> 03:46.480
The elephant depicts everything else that happens in our minds, the bulk of which is

03:46.480 --> 03:50.080
beyond the scope of our conscious reasoning.

03:50.080 --> 03:54.760
Reasoning with emotions is what happens whenever the rider interprets what is happening in ways

03:54.760 --> 04:00.040
that are constant with the elephant's reactive emotional state, without the added solution

04:00.040 --> 04:01.880
of what is true.

04:01.880 --> 04:07.280
Typically, the rider does his job without complaint, but the rider can talk back to

04:07.280 --> 04:11.520
the elephant, especially if he can learn to speak the elephant's language, which is

04:11.520 --> 04:13.840
a language of intuition.

04:13.840 --> 04:20.440
Boethius demonstrated this talking-back technique by creating lady philosophy and having her

04:20.440 --> 04:26.680
ask the sorts of questions one learns to ask oneself in cognitive behavioral therapy.

04:26.680 --> 04:32.480
If you engage in this talking-back procedure regularly, it becomes easier to do.

04:32.480 --> 04:37.440
Over time, the rider improves his skills and the elephant becomes better trained.

04:37.440 --> 04:41.600
The two work together with a sense of mutual understanding.

04:41.600 --> 04:47.200
That is the strength and promise of cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT.

04:47.200 --> 04:53.160
In the 1960s, a psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania named Aaron Beck developed

04:53.160 --> 04:56.040
cognitive behavioral therapy.

04:56.040 --> 05:00.560
Clinicians presumed that depression and the distorted thinking that results from it were

05:00.560 --> 05:08.360
just the surface indication of deeper problems, usually relating to unresolved childhood conflict.

05:08.360 --> 05:13.080
For depression to be treated, you have to fix the underlying problem, and that could

05:13.080 --> 05:15.640
take many years of therapy.

05:15.640 --> 05:20.280
But Beck noticed a close connection between the thoughts a person had and the feelings

05:20.280 --> 05:21.960
that came with them.

05:21.960 --> 05:26.920
He noticed that his patients managed to get themselves caught in a feedback loop in which

05:26.920 --> 05:33.280
negative beliefs caused powerful negative feelings, which in turn drove their reasoning,

05:33.280 --> 05:37.520
prompting them to find evidence to support their negative beliefs.

05:37.520 --> 05:38.520
Did you know?

05:38.520 --> 05:45.640
According to a 2019 article on Starling Mind, cognitive behavioral therapy alone was found

05:45.640 --> 05:51.200
to be 50 to 75% effective for overcoming depression and anxiety.

05:56.920 --> 06:18.680
Chapter 3 Humans are tribal creatures who readily

06:18.680 --> 06:22.800
form groups to compete with other groups.

06:22.800 --> 06:28.360
One of Jonathan Haidt's favorite thinkers of all time is Emile Durkheim, the 19th to

06:28.360 --> 06:31.880
early 20th century French sociologist.

06:31.880 --> 06:37.960
Durkheim saw groups and communities as social entities that have a persistent need to improve

06:37.960 --> 06:42.720
their inner cohesion in their shared sense of moral order.

06:42.720 --> 06:48.040
He said that, as humans, we have access to a set of emotions that we experience only

06:48.040 --> 06:53.600
when we are part of a collective group, feelings like collective effervescence, which Durkheim

06:53.600 --> 06:57.600
interpreted as social electricity.

06:57.600 --> 07:03.480
Social electricity is produced when a group comes together and achieves a state of union.

07:03.480 --> 07:08.280
People can shuffle between these two levels throughout a single day, and it is the purpose

07:08.280 --> 07:14.440
of religious rituals to pull people to a higher collective level, bind them to the group,

07:14.440 --> 07:20.600
and then return them to their day-to-day life with their group identity and loyalty boosted.

07:20.600 --> 07:28.120
In 1978, the sociologist Albert Bergensen published an essay titled A Durkheimian Theory

07:28.120 --> 07:36.200
of Witch Hunts Using the Chinese Cultural Revolution of 1966 to 1969 as an illustration.

07:36.200 --> 07:43.760
Bergensen used Durkheim to illuminate the madness that erupted in Beijing in May 1966

07:43.760 --> 07:49.600
between Mao Zedong and the Red Guards formed by zealous college students.

07:49.600 --> 07:54.640
During those years, the Red Guards fished out any trace they could find of capitalism,

07:54.640 --> 07:57.240
foreign effect, or bourgeois values.

07:57.240 --> 08:02.360
They were ruthless to the point of suspecting anyone successful or accomplished, imprisoning

08:02.360 --> 08:05.440
and murdering them in the process.

08:05.440 --> 08:10.800
Among the many brutal characteristics of the Cultural Revolution were the struggle sessions

08:10.800 --> 08:17.320
in which those accused of ideological impurity were encircled, harassed, humiliated, and

08:17.320 --> 08:23.560
sometimes beaten as they admitted their crimes, offered apologies, and promised to do better.

08:23.560 --> 08:29.120
Over the next few years, millions were persecuted and thousands were murdered.

08:29.120 --> 08:35.080
Free speech and the ability to tolerate offense are the hallmarks of a free and open society.

08:35.080 --> 08:39.640
Greg Lukyanov Bergensen illustrates that there are three

08:39.640 --> 08:43.320
features common to most political witch hunts.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.080
They emerge quickly.

08:45.080 --> 08:47.920
Witch hunts appear in spectacular eruptions.

08:47.920 --> 08:51.320
They are not a normal component of social life.

08:51.320 --> 08:53.080
Crimes against the collective.

08:53.080 --> 08:58.360
The various accusations that occur during one of these witch hunts comprise charges of crimes

08:58.360 --> 09:02.200
perpetrated against the nation as a corporate whole.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.960
Charges are often trivial or fabricated.

09:04.960 --> 09:11.240
These crimes seem to involve the most insignificant behavioral acts, which are somehow interpreted

09:11.240 --> 09:13.400
as crimes against the nation as a whole.

09:35.360 --> 09:36.680
Chapter 4.

09:36.680 --> 09:42.680
Why the United States has experienced a steady increase in at least one form of polarization

09:42.680 --> 09:45.720
since the 1980s.

09:45.720 --> 09:53.080
American universities as complex institutions are becoming more disunited, angry, and polarized.

09:53.080 --> 09:58.720
We begin to see the left and the right sealed in a game of joint incitement and outrage

09:58.720 --> 10:04.240
that is an essential piece of the puzzle that the author is trying to solve in this guide.

10:04.240 --> 10:09.760
Alison Stranger, a professor in Middlebury who had sustained a concussion at the hands

10:09.760 --> 10:14.520
of protesters, said this in a New York Times essay she wrote.

10:14.520 --> 10:19.840
In the days post-violence, some have turned this story as one about what's wrong with

10:19.840 --> 10:26.080
elite colleges and universities, our coddled youth or intolerant liberalism.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.480
Those analyses are incomplete.

10:28.480 --> 10:33.680
Political life and lecture in the United States are at a heated point and nowhere is the reaction

10:33.680 --> 10:37.600
to that more heightened than on college campuses.

10:37.600 --> 10:42.960
Alison Stranger then listed the numerous ways in which former President Trump had disrespected

10:42.960 --> 10:48.120
or offended members of marginalized groups while promoting hateful speech among several

10:48.120 --> 10:50.120
of his followers.

10:50.120 --> 10:55.600
One reason for the centrist and bipartisan poise of American politics is that during

10:55.600 --> 11:01.400
and before World War II, the country faced a series of common enemies, including the

11:01.400 --> 11:07.640
Great Depression, the Axis Powers during World War II, and the Soviets during the Cold War.

11:07.640 --> 11:12.520
As a result of the loss of a common enemy after the collapse of the Soviet Union can

11:12.520 --> 11:16.840
be anticipated to lead to more intra-tribal disputes.

11:16.840 --> 11:24.200
Secondly, since the 1970s, Americans generally have increasingly self-segregated into politically

11:24.200 --> 11:30.880
homogenous societies as Bill Bishop revealed in his noteworthy 2008 book, The Big Sort

11:30.880 --> 11:35.480
Why the Clustering of Like-Minded America is Tearing Us Apart.

11:35.480 --> 11:40.680
Successive research has shown that we live in economically and politically segregated

11:40.680 --> 11:45.560
communities increasing daily right down to the city block.

11:45.560 --> 11:50.240
The two major political parties have grouped themselves along similar lines.

11:50.240 --> 11:56.920
The Republican Party featuring an imbalanced order of older, white, rural, male, and Christian.

11:56.920 --> 12:02.080
The Democratic Party, on the other hand, features the increasingly young, non-white,

12:02.080 --> 12:05.640
urban, female, and non-religious.

12:05.640 --> 12:11.080
Minor segregations are enough to run the fabric of peaceful and productive societies.

12:11.080 --> 12:18.120
A third reason is the media environment, which increasingly finds ways that foster division.

12:18.120 --> 12:24.480
Then, there's the so-called filter bubble, in which search engines and YouTube algorithms

12:24.480 --> 12:29.800
are developed to give you more of what you seem to be attracted to, leading both conservatives

12:29.800 --> 12:36.440
and progressives into disconnected moral matrices supported by mutually contradictory, informative

12:36.440 --> 12:37.200
worlds.

12:54.480 --> 13:00.000
Chapter 5 The primary cause of the increase in mental

13:00.000 --> 13:05.560
illness is the frequent use of smartphones and other electronic devices.

13:05.560 --> 13:12.480
Jean Twenge, a social psychologist at San Diego State University and an expert on how generations

13:12.480 --> 13:19.480
differ psychologically and why, names the generation after the millennials Ai-jen, which is short

13:19.480 --> 13:25.280
for Internet Generation because they are the first generation to grow up with the Internet

13:25.280 --> 13:26.720
in their pockets.

13:26.720 --> 13:33.880
The oldest millennials born in 1982 searched for music and map quest directions using Netscape

13:33.880 --> 13:41.000
and Alta Vista on their compact home computers in the late 1990s, but search engines don't

13:41.000 --> 13:43.520
change social relationships.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.760
Social media does.

13:45.760 --> 13:51.080
Marking the line between generations is always difficult, but based on their psychological

13:51.080 --> 13:57.560
profiles, Twenge suggests that one possible reason for the discontinuity in self-reported

13:57.560 --> 14:04.600
traits and attitudes between millennials and Ai-jen is that in 2006, when Ai-jen's oldest

14:04.600 --> 14:08.640
was turning 11, Facebook altered its membership rule.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.960
You no longer had to prove enrollment in a college now.

14:11.960 --> 14:17.480
Any 13-year-old or any younger kid ready to claim to be 13 could join.

14:17.480 --> 14:24.000
Ai-jen is the first generation that spent and still is spending its formative teen years

14:24.000 --> 14:29.520
submerged in the giant social and commercial experiment of social media.

14:29.520 --> 14:35.400
Jean Twenge suggests that there are two major generational changes that may be driving the

14:35.400 --> 14:40.000
rise of safetyism on campus since 2013.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.760
The first is that kids grow up much more slowly nowadays.

14:44.760 --> 14:50.920
The second main generational change is a quick surge in rates of anxiety and depression.

14:50.920 --> 14:58.360
By 2016, roughly one in every five girls reported signs that met the measures for having endured

14:58.360 --> 15:01.880
a major depressive episode in the previous year.

15:01.880 --> 15:13.200
The rate for boys also increased, but more slowly, from 4.5% in 2011 to 6.4% in 2016.

15:13.200 --> 15:16.640
Suicide and attempted suicide rates vary by sex.

15:16.640 --> 15:21.640
Girls make more attempts, but boys die more often by irreversible methods like guns or

15:21.640 --> 15:23.320
tall buildings.

15:23.320 --> 15:29.280
The boys' suicide rate has fluctuated in recent decades, rising in the 1980s during

15:29.280 --> 15:35.160
the massive wave of crime and violence that waned suddenly in the 1990s.

15:35.160 --> 15:39.960
The rate of suicide in boys reached its peak in 1991.

15:39.960 --> 15:45.800
While the rise, since 2007, does not bring it back up to its peak, it is still disturbingly

15:45.800 --> 15:46.360
high.

15:59.280 --> 16:06.520
Chapter 6.

16:06.520 --> 16:12.600
The decline of play, all work and no play makes Jack or Jill a dull child.

16:12.600 --> 16:17.200
When observed from a distance, child play is an unusual thing.

16:17.200 --> 16:22.640
Peter Lafrener, a developmental psychologist at the University of Maine, points out that

16:22.640 --> 16:28.720
children's play combines the expenditure of great energy with apparently meaningless

16:28.720 --> 16:29.760
risk.

16:29.760 --> 16:34.360
But if nearly all mammals engage in it and if some of them get injured or eaten while

16:34.360 --> 16:40.840
doing it, there must be some pretty powerful benefits to compensate for the risks.

16:40.840 --> 16:45.960
Play is vital for wiring a mammal's brain to develop a functioning adult.

16:45.960 --> 16:51.280
Mammals that are withheld from play won't evolve to their full capacity.

16:51.280 --> 16:56.000
Genes are crucial for getting the numerous cell lines that begin in the embryo and genes

16:56.000 --> 17:00.400
direct brain development toward a first draft in utero.

17:00.400 --> 17:05.400
But experience counts too, even while the baby is in the uterus, and after birth it

17:05.400 --> 17:07.400
makes a difference.

17:07.400 --> 17:12.920
Experience is so important for wiring a large brain that the first draft of the brain contains

17:12.920 --> 17:18.960
a strong impetus to develop behaviors that will give the brain the right kind of feedback

17:19.040 --> 17:24.920
to build itself for success in whatever environment that happens to surround it.

17:24.920 --> 17:30.720
That's why young mammals are always eager to play irrespective of the risks.

17:30.720 --> 17:35.000
It's easy to see how this works with physical and social skills.

17:35.000 --> 17:40.800
The genes get the ball rolling on the first draft of the brain, but the brain is expecting

17:40.800 --> 17:41.800
more.

17:41.800 --> 17:46.880
The brain expects the child to engage in thousands of hours of play, including thousands

17:46.880 --> 17:54.040
of collapses, bruises, disputes, taunts, coalitions, deceptions, competitions, and acts of exclusion

17:54.040 --> 17:56.120
to develop.

17:56.120 --> 18:00.640
Children who are deprived of play are more likely not to develop into physically and

18:00.640 --> 18:04.440
socially able teens and adults.

18:04.440 --> 18:10.040
Research has revealed that nervous children may arouse overprotective behavior from others,

18:10.040 --> 18:15.120
such as parents and caretakers, in that this strengthens the child's awareness of danger

18:15.120 --> 18:19.600
and decreases their perception of preventing the threat.

18:19.600 --> 18:25.240
Overprotection might, however, result in excessive levels of anxiety.

18:25.240 --> 18:29.760
Overprotection through governmental control of playgrounds and overstated fear of playground

18:29.760 --> 18:34.880
accidents might thus result in a rise of anxiety in the society.

18:34.880 --> 18:41.120
Vigorous physical free play, outdoors and done with other kids, is a vital kind of play that

18:41.120 --> 19:03.760
our developed minds are expecting.

Chapter 7 Wiser Kids How To Build Children That Are Ready For Anything

19:11.320 --> 19:16.520
Something is not going well with American teenagers as seen in the statistics on depression,

19:16.520 --> 19:18.600
anxiety and suicide.

19:18.600 --> 19:23.360
Now that you know that the decline of free play may be part of the reason for children's

19:23.360 --> 19:29.960
intensified fragility, this is the best time to prepare your kid for life.

19:29.960 --> 19:35.320
You cannot teach anti-fragility instantly, but you can give your children the gift of

19:35.320 --> 19:37.200
an experience.

19:37.200 --> 19:42.960
The gift of an experience starts with knowing that kids need some unsupervised time to learn

19:42.960 --> 19:48.720
how to judge risks for themselves and learn to deal with things like frustration, lethargy

19:48.720 --> 19:51.800
and interpersonal disputes.

19:51.800 --> 19:57.320
Here are some specific recommendations for parents, teachers and all who care for children.

19:57.320 --> 20:02.560
A. Resume that your kids are more competent this month than they were last month.

20:02.560 --> 20:07.840
Each month, ask them what challenges they think they undertake on their own.

20:07.840 --> 20:12.240
Suppress the impulse to jump in and help them when they're trying to do things and seem

20:12.240 --> 20:14.240
to be doing them wrongly.

20:14.240 --> 20:20.560
B. Let your kids take more chances and let them learn from getting some bumps and bruises.

20:20.560 --> 20:27.480
C. Urge your kids to walk or ride bicycles to and from school at the earliest age as possible.

20:27.480 --> 20:32.520
D. Find for your kids a group of kids in the neighborhood who come from like-minded

20:32.520 --> 20:33.720
families.

20:33.720 --> 20:39.880
E. Find ways for kids to get together in nearby parks or specific backyards.

20:39.880 --> 20:46.120
Teaching kids that failures, insults and painful experiences will do lasting damage is harmful

20:46.120 --> 20:47.480
in and of itself.

20:47.480 --> 20:53.160
Human beings need physical and mental challenges and stressors or we deteriorate.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.160
Greg Lukainov.

20:55.160 --> 21:00.200
Your worst enemy cannot hurt you as much as your unprotected emotions.

21:00.280 --> 21:04.680
Children, like adults too, are inclined to emotional reasoning.

21:04.680 --> 21:10.280
They must learn to notice and manage their emotional reactions and choose how to respond.

21:10.280 --> 21:17.400
A. Teach children the root of cognitive behavioral therapy, but in many ways it's just cognitive

21:17.400 --> 21:23.320
behavioral techniques because the intellectual habits it teaches are good for everyone.

21:23.320 --> 21:29.720
B. Teach children mindfulness, limit and refine device time.

21:29.720 --> 21:34.280
If given the freedom, many children would spend most of their free time staring at a

21:34.280 --> 21:38.600
screen, hence try placing clear limits on device time.

21:38.600 --> 21:43.680
Two hours a day seems to be a decent maximum as there is no evidence of negative mental

21:43.680 --> 21:45.240
health effects at this level.

21:59.720 --> 22:09.400
Conclusion.

22:09.400 --> 22:15.280
According to Jean Twenge, a psychologist at San Diego State University, the main cause

22:15.280 --> 22:22.280
of the increase in mental illness is the regular use of smartphones and other electronic devices.

22:22.280 --> 22:27.680
Less than two hours a day seems to have no harmful effects, but adolescents who waste

22:27.760 --> 22:32.960
several hours a day interacting with screens, especially if they start in their early teen

22:32.960 --> 22:38.800
years or younger, have poorer mental health results than adolescents who use these devices

22:38.800 --> 22:43.200
less and who spend more time in face-to-face social interaction.

22:44.080 --> 22:49.360
Our societies are plagued with an interesting set of untruths that are being fed to the young

22:49.360 --> 22:53.760
generation, thus fostering fragility and levels not previously seen.

22:54.480 --> 22:59.520
There's the untruth of fragility, that of emotional and not objective reasoning,

22:59.520 --> 23:03.200
and the variations that exist between good and bad people.

23:04.080 --> 23:09.520
There's also the enactment of bad ideas, sometimes with seemingly good intentions.

23:09.520 --> 23:15.360
This blunder has been found to manifest in some school administrators and democratic leaders.

23:15.360 --> 23:21.840
The greatest implication of the witch-hunting syndrome ubiquitous in our society today is

23:21.840 --> 23:27.760
the various forms of segregation that have been birthed. However, the path to societal recovery

23:27.760 --> 23:32.960
from degeneration involves molding wiser kids, universities, and societies.

23:34.000 --> 23:39.600
Nothing is of more importance to the public wheel than to form and train up youth in wisdom

23:39.600 --> 23:46.000
and virtue. Wise and good men are, in my opinion, the strength of a state, Benjamin Franklin.

23:46.960 --> 23:52.400
Most students are not fragile, they are not snowflakes, and they are not afraid of ideas,

23:52.400 --> 23:58.480
so if a small group of universities is able to develop a different sort of academic culture,

23:58.480 --> 24:03.200
one that finds ways to make students from all identity groups feel welcome

24:03.200 --> 24:08.160
without using the divisive methods that seem to be backfiring on so many campuses,

24:08.720 --> 24:11.920
market forces will most likely take care of the rest.

24:12.880 --> 24:19.360
Try this. Allow your children to engage in free play. Allow them to be exposed to challenges

24:19.360 --> 24:25.280
and stressors that are within limits and age-appropriate, or they won't mature into capable

24:25.280 --> 24:31.360
and strong adults able to engage productively with ideas and people that challenge their moral

24:31.360 --> 24:35.840
convictions and beliefs.
