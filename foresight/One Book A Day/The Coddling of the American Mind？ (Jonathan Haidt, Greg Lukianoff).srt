1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,080
Chapter 1.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,320
What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,280
The immune system is a gift of evolutionary engineering.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,960
It can't possibly anticipate all the pathogens and parasites a child will come across, so

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,480
it is designed to learn rapidly from early experience.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,000
The immune system is a sophisticated adaptive system, one that can adapt and grow with a

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,400
change in the environment.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:39,000
This is the underlying explanation for what is called the Hygiene Hypothesis, the leading

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,920
definition of why allergy rates naturally go up as countries get wealthier and cleaner,

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,880
a case of the dangers of growth.

11
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:53,920
Of course, Friedrich Nietzsche's original quote, What doesn't kill me makes me stronger,

12
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,040
is not entirely true of taken literally.

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:03,240
Some experiences that don't kill you can leave you forever scarred and weakened.

14
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,160
Fragility is a direct function of status.

15
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,920
Children in third world countries daily brave the elements, but such an exposure may kill

16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,080
another from affluent climes.

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,200
Teaching kids that setbacks, ridicule and unfortunate occurrences will cause lasting

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,800
destruction is dangerous.

19
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,480
Muscles need physical and mental challenges and stressors, or we disintegrate.

20
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,080
For instance, muscles and joints need stressors to evolve appropriately.

21
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,800
Too much rest causes muscles to weaken, joints to lose the span of motion, heart and lung

22
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,720
capacity to wane, and blood clots to form.

23
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,600
Without the challenges produced by gravity, astronauts develop muscle weakness and joint

24
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
degeneration.

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,920
Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the Lebanese-born statistician and stock trader Polymath, who is now a professor

26
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,680
of risk engineering at New York University, explains the harm of avoiding stressors,

27
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,360
dangers and small doses of pain.

28
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,040
In 2017, he published a bestseller titled The Black Swan.

29
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,360
Professor Taleb claimed that most of us think about risk wrongly.

30
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,520
In complex systems, unforeseen situations will certainly arise, yet we continue to assess

31
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,880
risk due to our past or deals.

32
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,840
Life has a way of springing up shocking occurrences.

33
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,280
Situations Taleb relates to the appearance of a black swan.

34
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,720
Based on experience, you assumed that all swans were white.

35
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,200
To better understand how society drifted towards fragility and what can be done to recover

36
00:02:43,200 --> 00:03:08,000
our emotional and intellectual boldness, endeavor to read this summary to the end.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,320
Chapter 2 The untruth of emotional reasoning.

38
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,080
Always trust your feelings.

39
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,560
In the happiness hypothesis, Jonathan Haid drew on the teachings of Buddha and other

40
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,480
philosophers to offer the analogy that the mind is divided into fractions that sometimes

41
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,160
conflict like a small rider sitting on top of a large elephant.

42
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,360
The rider symbolizes conscious processes.

43
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,040
For years, language-based thoughts occupy our conscious minds and we are in control to

44
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,560
some degree.

45
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,480
The elephant depicts everything else that happens in our minds, the bulk of which is

46
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,080
beyond the scope of our conscious reasoning.

47
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,760
Reasoning with emotions is what happens whenever the rider interprets what is happening in ways

48
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,040
that are constant with the elephant's reactive emotional state, without the added solution

49
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,880
of what is true.

50
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:07,280
Typically, the rider does his job without complaint, but the rider can talk back to

51
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,520
the elephant, especially if he can learn to speak the elephant's language, which is

52
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,840
a language of intuition.

53
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,440
Boethius demonstrated this talking-back technique by creating lady philosophy and having her

54
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,680
ask the sorts of questions one learns to ask oneself in cognitive behavioral therapy.

55
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,480
If you engage in this talking-back procedure regularly, it becomes easier to do.

56
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,440
Over time, the rider improves his skills and the elephant becomes better trained.

57
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,600
The two work together with a sense of mutual understanding.

58
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,200
That is the strength and promise of cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT.

59
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:53,160
In the 1960s, a psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania named Aaron Beck developed

60
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,040
cognitive behavioral therapy.

61
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,560
Clinicians presumed that depression and the distorted thinking that results from it were

62
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:08,360
just the surface indication of deeper problems, usually relating to unresolved childhood conflict.

63
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,080
For depression to be treated, you have to fix the underlying problem, and that could

64
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,640
take many years of therapy.

65
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,280
But Beck noticed a close connection between the thoughts a person had and the feelings

66
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,960
that came with them.

67
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,920
He noticed that his patients managed to get themselves caught in a feedback loop in which

68
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:33,280
negative beliefs caused powerful negative feelings, which in turn drove their reasoning,

69
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,520
prompting them to find evidence to support their negative beliefs.

70
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,520
Did you know?

71
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:45,640
According to a 2019 article on Starling Mind, cognitive behavioral therapy alone was found

72
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:51,200
to be 50 to 75% effective for overcoming depression and anxiety.

73
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:18,680
Chapter 3 Humans are tribal creatures who readily

74
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,800
form groups to compete with other groups.

75
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,360
One of Jonathan Haidt's favorite thinkers of all time is Emile Durkheim, the 19th to

76
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,880
early 20th century French sociologist.

77
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,960
Durkheim saw groups and communities as social entities that have a persistent need to improve

78
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,720
their inner cohesion in their shared sense of moral order.

79
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,040
He said that, as humans, we have access to a set of emotions that we experience only

80
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:53,600
when we are part of a collective group, feelings like collective effervescence, which Durkheim

81
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,600
interpreted as social electricity.

82
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:03,480
Social electricity is produced when a group comes together and achieves a state of union.

83
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,280
People can shuffle between these two levels throughout a single day, and it is the purpose

84
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:14,440
of religious rituals to pull people to a higher collective level, bind them to the group,

85
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:20,600
and then return them to their day-to-day life with their group identity and loyalty boosted.

86
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:28,120
In 1978, the sociologist Albert Bergensen published an essay titled A Durkheimian Theory

87
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:36,200
of Witch Hunts Using the Chinese Cultural Revolution of 1966 to 1969 as an illustration.

88
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:43,760
Bergensen used Durkheim to illuminate the madness that erupted in Beijing in May 1966

89
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:49,600
between Mao Zedong and the Red Guards formed by zealous college students.

90
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,640
During those years, the Red Guards fished out any trace they could find of capitalism,

91
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,240
foreign effect, or bourgeois values.

92
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,360
They were ruthless to the point of suspecting anyone successful or accomplished, imprisoning

93
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,440
and murdering them in the process.

94
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,800
Among the many brutal characteristics of the Cultural Revolution were the struggle sessions

95
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,320
in which those accused of ideological impurity were encircled, harassed, humiliated, and

96
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:23,560
sometimes beaten as they admitted their crimes, offered apologies, and promised to do better.

97
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:29,120
Over the next few years, millions were persecuted and thousands were murdered.

98
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,080
Free speech and the ability to tolerate offense are the hallmarks of a free and open society.

99
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,640
Greg Lukyanov Bergensen illustrates that there are three

100
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,320
features common to most political witch hunts.

101
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,080
They emerge quickly.

102
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,920
Witch hunts appear in spectacular eruptions.

103
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,320
They are not a normal component of social life.

104
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,080
Crimes against the collective.

105
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,360
The various accusations that occur during one of these witch hunts comprise charges of crimes

106
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,200
perpetrated against the nation as a corporate whole.

107
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,960
Charges are often trivial or fabricated.

108
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:11,240
These crimes seem to involve the most insignificant behavioral acts, which are somehow interpreted

109
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,400
as crimes against the nation as a whole.

110
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,680
Chapter 4.

111
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:42,680
Why the United States has experienced a steady increase in at least one form of polarization

112
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,720
since the 1980s.

113
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:53,080
American universities as complex institutions are becoming more disunited, angry, and polarized.

114
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:58,720
We begin to see the left and the right sealed in a game of joint incitement and outrage

115
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,240
that is an essential piece of the puzzle that the author is trying to solve in this guide.

116
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,760
Alison Stranger, a professor in Middlebury who had sustained a concussion at the hands

117
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,520
of protesters, said this in a New York Times essay she wrote.

118
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,840
In the days post-violence, some have turned this story as one about what's wrong with

119
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:26,080
elite colleges and universities, our coddled youth or intolerant liberalism.

120
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,480
Those analyses are incomplete.

121
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,680
Political life and lecture in the United States are at a heated point and nowhere is the reaction

122
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,600
to that more heightened than on college campuses.

123
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,960
Alison Stranger then listed the numerous ways in which former President Trump had disrespected

124
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:48,120
or offended members of marginalized groups while promoting hateful speech among several

125
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,120
of his followers.

126
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:55,600
One reason for the centrist and bipartisan poise of American politics is that during

127
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,400
and before World War II, the country faced a series of common enemies, including the

128
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:07,640
Great Depression, the Axis Powers during World War II, and the Soviets during the Cold War.

129
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,520
As a result of the loss of a common enemy after the collapse of the Soviet Union can

130
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,840
be anticipated to lead to more intra-tribal disputes.

131
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:24,200
Secondly, since the 1970s, Americans generally have increasingly self-segregated into politically

132
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:30,880
homogenous societies as Bill Bishop revealed in his noteworthy 2008 book, The Big Sort

133
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,480
Why the Clustering of Like-Minded America is Tearing Us Apart.

134
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,680
Successive research has shown that we live in economically and politically segregated

135
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,560
communities increasing daily right down to the city block.

136
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,240
The two major political parties have grouped themselves along similar lines.

137
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,920
The Republican Party featuring an imbalanced order of older, white, rural, male, and Christian.

138
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:02,080
The Democratic Party, on the other hand, features the increasingly young, non-white,

139
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,640
urban, female, and non-religious.

140
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:11,080
Minor segregations are enough to run the fabric of peaceful and productive societies.

141
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:18,120
A third reason is the media environment, which increasingly finds ways that foster division.

142
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:24,480
Then, there's the so-called filter bubble, in which search engines and YouTube algorithms

143
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,800
are developed to give you more of what you seem to be attracted to, leading both conservatives

144
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:36,440
and progressives into disconnected moral matrices supported by mutually contradictory, informative

145
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,200
worlds.

146
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,000
Chapter 5 The primary cause of the increase in mental

147
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,560
illness is the frequent use of smartphones and other electronic devices.

148
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:12,480
Jean Twenge, a social psychologist at San Diego State University and an expert on how generations

149
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:19,480
differ psychologically and why, names the generation after the millennials Ai-jen, which is short

150
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:25,280
for Internet Generation because they are the first generation to grow up with the Internet

151
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,720
in their pockets.

152
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,880
The oldest millennials born in 1982 searched for music and map quest directions using Netscape

153
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:41,000
and Alta Vista on their compact home computers in the late 1990s, but search engines don't

154
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,520
change social relationships.

155
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,760
Social media does.

156
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,080
Marking the line between generations is always difficult, but based on their psychological

157
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:57,560
profiles, Twenge suggests that one possible reason for the discontinuity in self-reported

158
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:04,600
traits and attitudes between millennials and Ai-jen is that in 2006, when Ai-jen's oldest

159
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,640
was turning 11, Facebook altered its membership rule.

160
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,960
You no longer had to prove enrollment in a college now.

161
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:17,480
Any 13-year-old or any younger kid ready to claim to be 13 could join.

162
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:24,000
Ai-jen is the first generation that spent and still is spending its formative teen years

163
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,520
submerged in the giant social and commercial experiment of social media.

164
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:35,400
Jean Twenge suggests that there are two major generational changes that may be driving the

165
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:40,000
rise of safetyism on campus since 2013.

166
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,760
The first is that kids grow up much more slowly nowadays.

167
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:50,920
The second main generational change is a quick surge in rates of anxiety and depression.

168
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:58,360
By 2016, roughly one in every five girls reported signs that met the measures for having endured

169
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,880
a major depressive episode in the previous year.

170
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:13,200
The rate for boys also increased, but more slowly, from 4.5% in 2011 to 6.4% in 2016.

171
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,640
Suicide and attempted suicide rates vary by sex.

172
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,640
Girls make more attempts, but boys die more often by irreversible methods like guns or

173
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,320
tall buildings.

174
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:29,280
The boys' suicide rate has fluctuated in recent decades, rising in the 1980s during

175
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:35,160
the massive wave of crime and violence that waned suddenly in the 1990s.

176
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,960
The rate of suicide in boys reached its peak in 1991.

177
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:45,800
While the rise, since 2007, does not bring it back up to its peak, it is still disturbingly

178
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,360
high.

179
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:06,520
Chapter 6.

180
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:12,600
The decline of play, all work and no play makes Jack or Jill a dull child.

181
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,200
When observed from a distance, child play is an unusual thing.

182
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,640
Peter Lafrener, a developmental psychologist at the University of Maine, points out that

183
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:28,720
children's play combines the expenditure of great energy with apparently meaningless

184
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,760
risk.

185
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,360
But if nearly all mammals engage in it and if some of them get injured or eaten while

186
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:40,840
doing it, there must be some pretty powerful benefits to compensate for the risks.

187
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:45,960
Play is vital for wiring a mammal's brain to develop a functioning adult.

188
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:51,280
Mammals that are withheld from play won't evolve to their full capacity.

189
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:56,000
Genes are crucial for getting the numerous cell lines that begin in the embryo and genes

190
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,400
direct brain development toward a first draft in utero.

191
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,400
But experience counts too, even while the baby is in the uterus, and after birth it

192
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
makes a difference.

193
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,920
Experience is so important for wiring a large brain that the first draft of the brain contains

194
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:18,960
a strong impetus to develop behaviors that will give the brain the right kind of feedback

195
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:24,920
to build itself for success in whatever environment that happens to surround it.

196
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:30,720
That's why young mammals are always eager to play irrespective of the risks.

197
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,000
It's easy to see how this works with physical and social skills.

198
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,800
The genes get the ball rolling on the first draft of the brain, but the brain is expecting

199
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
more.

200
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,880
The brain expects the child to engage in thousands of hours of play, including thousands

201
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:54,040
of collapses, bruises, disputes, taunts, coalitions, deceptions, competitions, and acts of exclusion

202
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,120
to develop.

203
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,640
Children who are deprived of play are more likely not to develop into physically and

204
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,440
socially able teens and adults.

205
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:10,040
Research has revealed that nervous children may arouse overprotective behavior from others,

206
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,120
such as parents and caretakers, in that this strengthens the child's awareness of danger

207
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,600
and decreases their perception of preventing the threat.

208
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,240
Overprotection might, however, result in excessive levels of anxiety.

209
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,760
Overprotection through governmental control of playgrounds and overstated fear of playground

210
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,880
accidents might thus result in a rise of anxiety in the society.

211
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:41,120
Vigorous physical free play, outdoors and done with other kids, is a vital kind of play that

212
00:18:41,120 --> 00:19:03,760
our developed minds are expecting.

213
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:11,080
Chapter 7 Wiser Kids How To Build Children That Are Ready For Anything

214
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,520
Something is not going well with American teenagers as seen in the statistics on depression,

215
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,600
anxiety and suicide.

216
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,360
Now that you know that the decline of free play may be part of the reason for children's

217
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:29,960
intensified fragility, this is the best time to prepare your kid for life.

218
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,320
You cannot teach anti-fragility instantly, but you can give your children the gift of

219
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,200
an experience.

220
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,960
The gift of an experience starts with knowing that kids need some unsupervised time to learn

221
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,720
how to judge risks for themselves and learn to deal with things like frustration, lethargy

222
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,800
and interpersonal disputes.

223
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:57,320
Here are some specific recommendations for parents, teachers and all who care for children.

224
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,560
A. Resume that your kids are more competent this month than they were last month.

225
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,840
Each month, ask them what challenges they think they undertake on their own.

226
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,240
Suppress the impulse to jump in and help them when they're trying to do things and seem

227
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
to be doing them wrongly.

228
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,560
B. Let your kids take more chances and let them learn from getting some bumps and bruises.

229
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:27,480
C. Urge your kids to walk or ride bicycles to and from school at the earliest age as possible.

230
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,520
D. Find for your kids a group of kids in the neighborhood who come from like-minded

231
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,720
families.

232
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:39,880
E. Find ways for kids to get together in nearby parks or specific backyards.

233
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:46,120
Teaching kids that failures, insults and painful experiences will do lasting damage is harmful

234
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,480
in and of itself.

235
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:53,160
Human beings need physical and mental challenges and stressors or we deteriorate.

236
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,160
Greg Lukainov.

237
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:00,200
Your worst enemy cannot hurt you as much as your unprotected emotions.

238
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,680
Children, like adults too, are inclined to emotional reasoning.

239
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:10,280
They must learn to notice and manage their emotional reactions and choose how to respond.

240
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:17,400
A. Teach children the root of cognitive behavioral therapy, but in many ways it's just cognitive

241
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:23,320
behavioral techniques because the intellectual habits it teaches are good for everyone.

242
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:29,720
B. Teach children mindfulness, limit and refine device time.

243
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,280
If given the freedom, many children would spend most of their free time staring at a

244
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,600
screen, hence try placing clear limits on device time.

245
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,680
Two hours a day seems to be a decent maximum as there is no evidence of negative mental

246
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,240
health effects at this level.

247
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:09,400
Conclusion.

248
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:15,280
According to Jean Twenge, a psychologist at San Diego State University, the main cause

249
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:22,280
of the increase in mental illness is the regular use of smartphones and other electronic devices.

250
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:27,680
Less than two hours a day seems to have no harmful effects, but adolescents who waste

251
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,960
several hours a day interacting with screens, especially if they start in their early teen

252
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,800
years or younger, have poorer mental health results than adolescents who use these devices

253
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,200
less and who spend more time in face-to-face social interaction.

254
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,360
Our societies are plagued with an interesting set of untruths that are being fed to the young

255
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,760
generation, thus fostering fragility and levels not previously seen.

256
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,520
There's the untruth of fragility, that of emotional and not objective reasoning,

257
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,200
and the variations that exist between good and bad people.

258
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,520
There's also the enactment of bad ideas, sometimes with seemingly good intentions.

259
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:15,360
This blunder has been found to manifest in some school administrators and democratic leaders.

260
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:21,840
The greatest implication of the witch-hunting syndrome ubiquitous in our society today is

261
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,760
the various forms of segregation that have been birthed. However, the path to societal recovery

262
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,960
from degeneration involves molding wiser kids, universities, and societies.

263
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,600
Nothing is of more importance to the public wheel than to form and train up youth in wisdom

264
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:46,000
and virtue. Wise and good men are, in my opinion, the strength of a state, Benjamin Franklin.

265
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,400
Most students are not fragile, they are not snowflakes, and they are not afraid of ideas,

266
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:58,480
so if a small group of universities is able to develop a different sort of academic culture,

267
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,200
one that finds ways to make students from all identity groups feel welcome

268
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,160
without using the divisive methods that seem to be backfiring on so many campuses,

269
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,920
market forces will most likely take care of the rest.

270
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:19,360
Try this. Allow your children to engage in free play. Allow them to be exposed to challenges

271
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:25,280
and stressors that are within limits and age-appropriate, or they won't mature into capable

272
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:31,360
and strong adults able to engage productively with ideas and people that challenge their moral

273
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,840
convictions and beliefs.
