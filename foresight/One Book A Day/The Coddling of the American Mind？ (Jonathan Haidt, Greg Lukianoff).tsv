0	8080	Chapter 1.
8080	11320	What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.
11320	15280	The immune system is a gift of evolutionary engineering.
15280	20960	It can't possibly anticipate all the pathogens and parasites a child will come across, so
20960	25480	it is designed to learn rapidly from early experience.
25480	31000	The immune system is a sophisticated adaptive system, one that can adapt and grow with a
31000	33400	change in the environment.
33400	39000	This is the underlying explanation for what is called the Hygiene Hypothesis, the leading
39000	44920	definition of why allergy rates naturally go up as countries get wealthier and cleaner,
44920	47880	a case of the dangers of growth.
47880	53920	Of course, Friedrich Nietzsche's original quote, What doesn't kill me makes me stronger,
53920	57040	is not entirely true of taken literally.
57040	63240	Some experiences that don't kill you can leave you forever scarred and weakened.
63240	66160	Fragility is a direct function of status.
66160	71920	Children in third world countries daily brave the elements, but such an exposure may kill
71920	75080	another from affluent climes.
75080	80200	Teaching kids that setbacks, ridicule and unfortunate occurrences will cause lasting
80200	82800	destruction is dangerous.
82800	88480	Muscles need physical and mental challenges and stressors, or we disintegrate.
88480	93080	For instance, muscles and joints need stressors to evolve appropriately.
93080	98800	Too much rest causes muscles to weaken, joints to lose the span of motion, heart and lung
98800	102720	capacity to wane, and blood clots to form.
102720	107600	Without the challenges produced by gravity, astronauts develop muscle weakness and joint
107600	109600	degeneration.
109600	116920	Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the Lebanese-born statistician and stock trader Polymath, who is now a professor
116920	122680	of risk engineering at New York University, explains the harm of avoiding stressors,
122680	125360	dangers and small doses of pain.
125360	131040	In 2017, he published a bestseller titled The Black Swan.
131040	135360	Professor Taleb claimed that most of us think about risk wrongly.
135360	141520	In complex systems, unforeseen situations will certainly arise, yet we continue to assess
141520	144880	risk due to our past or deals.
144880	148840	Life has a way of springing up shocking occurrences.
148840	152280	Situations Taleb relates to the appearance of a black swan.
152280	156720	Based on experience, you assumed that all swans were white.
156720	163200	To better understand how society drifted towards fragility and what can be done to recover
163200	188000	our emotional and intellectual boldness, endeavor to read this summary to the end.
188000	192320	Chapter 2 The untruth of emotional reasoning.
192320	195080	Always trust your feelings.
195080	200560	In the happiness hypothesis, Jonathan Haid drew on the teachings of Buddha and other
200560	206480	philosophers to offer the analogy that the mind is divided into fractions that sometimes
206480	211160	conflict like a small rider sitting on top of a large elephant.
211160	214360	The rider symbolizes conscious processes.
214360	220040	For years, language-based thoughts occupy our conscious minds and we are in control to
220040	221560	some degree.
221560	226480	The elephant depicts everything else that happens in our minds, the bulk of which is
226480	230080	beyond the scope of our conscious reasoning.
230080	234760	Reasoning with emotions is what happens whenever the rider interprets what is happening in ways
234760	240040	that are constant with the elephant's reactive emotional state, without the added solution
240040	241880	of what is true.
241880	247280	Typically, the rider does his job without complaint, but the rider can talk back to
247280	251520	the elephant, especially if he can learn to speak the elephant's language, which is
251520	253840	a language of intuition.
253840	260440	Boethius demonstrated this talking-back technique by creating lady philosophy and having her
260440	266680	ask the sorts of questions one learns to ask oneself in cognitive behavioral therapy.
266680	272480	If you engage in this talking-back procedure regularly, it becomes easier to do.
272480	277440	Over time, the rider improves his skills and the elephant becomes better trained.
277440	281600	The two work together with a sense of mutual understanding.
281600	287200	That is the strength and promise of cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT.
287200	293160	In the 1960s, a psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania named Aaron Beck developed
293160	296040	cognitive behavioral therapy.
296040	300560	Clinicians presumed that depression and the distorted thinking that results from it were
300560	308360	just the surface indication of deeper problems, usually relating to unresolved childhood conflict.
308360	313080	For depression to be treated, you have to fix the underlying problem, and that could
313080	315640	take many years of therapy.
315640	320280	But Beck noticed a close connection between the thoughts a person had and the feelings
320280	321960	that came with them.
321960	326920	He noticed that his patients managed to get themselves caught in a feedback loop in which
326920	333280	negative beliefs caused powerful negative feelings, which in turn drove their reasoning,
333280	337520	prompting them to find evidence to support their negative beliefs.
337520	338520	Did you know?
338520	345640	According to a 2019 article on Starling Mind, cognitive behavioral therapy alone was found
345640	351200	to be 50 to 75% effective for overcoming depression and anxiety.
356920	378680	Chapter 3 Humans are tribal creatures who readily
378680	382800	form groups to compete with other groups.
382800	388360	One of Jonathan Haidt's favorite thinkers of all time is Emile Durkheim, the 19th to
388360	391880	early 20th century French sociologist.
391880	397960	Durkheim saw groups and communities as social entities that have a persistent need to improve
397960	402720	their inner cohesion in their shared sense of moral order.
402720	408040	He said that, as humans, we have access to a set of emotions that we experience only
408040	413600	when we are part of a collective group, feelings like collective effervescence, which Durkheim
413600	417600	interpreted as social electricity.
417600	423480	Social electricity is produced when a group comes together and achieves a state of union.
423480	428280	People can shuffle between these two levels throughout a single day, and it is the purpose
428280	434440	of religious rituals to pull people to a higher collective level, bind them to the group,
434440	440600	and then return them to their day-to-day life with their group identity and loyalty boosted.
440600	448120	In 1978, the sociologist Albert Bergensen published an essay titled A Durkheimian Theory
448120	456200	of Witch Hunts Using the Chinese Cultural Revolution of 1966 to 1969 as an illustration.
456200	463760	Bergensen used Durkheim to illuminate the madness that erupted in Beijing in May 1966
463760	469600	between Mao Zedong and the Red Guards formed by zealous college students.
469600	474640	During those years, the Red Guards fished out any trace they could find of capitalism,
474640	477240	foreign effect, or bourgeois values.
477240	482360	They were ruthless to the point of suspecting anyone successful or accomplished, imprisoning
482360	485440	and murdering them in the process.
485440	490800	Among the many brutal characteristics of the Cultural Revolution were the struggle sessions
490800	497320	in which those accused of ideological impurity were encircled, harassed, humiliated, and
497320	503560	sometimes beaten as they admitted their crimes, offered apologies, and promised to do better.
503560	509120	Over the next few years, millions were persecuted and thousands were murdered.
509120	515080	Free speech and the ability to tolerate offense are the hallmarks of a free and open society.
515080	519640	Greg Lukyanov Bergensen illustrates that there are three
519640	523320	features common to most political witch hunts.
523320	525080	They emerge quickly.
525080	527920	Witch hunts appear in spectacular eruptions.
527920	531320	They are not a normal component of social life.
531320	533080	Crimes against the collective.
533080	538360	The various accusations that occur during one of these witch hunts comprise charges of crimes
538360	542200	perpetrated against the nation as a corporate whole.
542200	544960	Charges are often trivial or fabricated.
544960	551240	These crimes seem to involve the most insignificant behavioral acts, which are somehow interpreted
551240	553400	as crimes against the nation as a whole.
575360	576680	Chapter 4.
576680	582680	Why the United States has experienced a steady increase in at least one form of polarization
582680	585720	since the 1980s.
585720	593080	American universities as complex institutions are becoming more disunited, angry, and polarized.
593080	598720	We begin to see the left and the right sealed in a game of joint incitement and outrage
598720	604240	that is an essential piece of the puzzle that the author is trying to solve in this guide.
604240	609760	Alison Stranger, a professor in Middlebury who had sustained a concussion at the hands
609760	614520	of protesters, said this in a New York Times essay she wrote.
614520	619840	In the days post-violence, some have turned this story as one about what's wrong with
619840	626080	elite colleges and universities, our coddled youth or intolerant liberalism.
626080	628480	Those analyses are incomplete.
628480	633680	Political life and lecture in the United States are at a heated point and nowhere is the reaction
633680	637600	to that more heightened than on college campuses.
637600	642960	Alison Stranger then listed the numerous ways in which former President Trump had disrespected
642960	648120	or offended members of marginalized groups while promoting hateful speech among several
648120	650120	of his followers.
650120	655600	One reason for the centrist and bipartisan poise of American politics is that during
655600	661400	and before World War II, the country faced a series of common enemies, including the
661400	667640	Great Depression, the Axis Powers during World War II, and the Soviets during the Cold War.
667640	672520	As a result of the loss of a common enemy after the collapse of the Soviet Union can
672520	676840	be anticipated to lead to more intra-tribal disputes.
676840	684200	Secondly, since the 1970s, Americans generally have increasingly self-segregated into politically
684200	690880	homogenous societies as Bill Bishop revealed in his noteworthy 2008 book, The Big Sort
690880	695480	Why the Clustering of Like-Minded America is Tearing Us Apart.
695480	700680	Successive research has shown that we live in economically and politically segregated
700680	705560	communities increasing daily right down to the city block.
705560	710240	The two major political parties have grouped themselves along similar lines.
710240	716920	The Republican Party featuring an imbalanced order of older, white, rural, male, and Christian.
716920	722080	The Democratic Party, on the other hand, features the increasingly young, non-white,
722080	725640	urban, female, and non-religious.
725640	731080	Minor segregations are enough to run the fabric of peaceful and productive societies.
731080	738120	A third reason is the media environment, which increasingly finds ways that foster division.
738120	744480	Then, there's the so-called filter bubble, in which search engines and YouTube algorithms
744480	749800	are developed to give you more of what you seem to be attracted to, leading both conservatives
749800	756440	and progressives into disconnected moral matrices supported by mutually contradictory, informative
756440	757200	worlds.
774480	780000	Chapter 5 The primary cause of the increase in mental
780000	785560	illness is the frequent use of smartphones and other electronic devices.
785560	792480	Jean Twenge, a social psychologist at San Diego State University and an expert on how generations
792480	799480	differ psychologically and why, names the generation after the millennials Ai-jen, which is short
799480	805280	for Internet Generation because they are the first generation to grow up with the Internet
805280	806720	in their pockets.
806720	813880	The oldest millennials born in 1982 searched for music and map quest directions using Netscape
813880	821000	and Alta Vista on their compact home computers in the late 1990s, but search engines don't
821000	823520	change social relationships.
823520	825760	Social media does.
825760	831080	Marking the line between generations is always difficult, but based on their psychological
831080	837560	profiles, Twenge suggests that one possible reason for the discontinuity in self-reported
837560	844600	traits and attitudes between millennials and Ai-jen is that in 2006, when Ai-jen's oldest
844600	848640	was turning 11, Facebook altered its membership rule.
848640	851960	You no longer had to prove enrollment in a college now.
851960	857480	Any 13-year-old or any younger kid ready to claim to be 13 could join.
857480	864000	Ai-jen is the first generation that spent and still is spending its formative teen years
864000	869520	submerged in the giant social and commercial experiment of social media.
869520	875400	Jean Twenge suggests that there are two major generational changes that may be driving the
875400	880000	rise of safetyism on campus since 2013.
880000	884760	The first is that kids grow up much more slowly nowadays.
884760	890920	The second main generational change is a quick surge in rates of anxiety and depression.
890920	898360	By 2016, roughly one in every five girls reported signs that met the measures for having endured
898360	901880	a major depressive episode in the previous year.
901880	913200	The rate for boys also increased, but more slowly, from 4.5% in 2011 to 6.4% in 2016.
913200	916640	Suicide and attempted suicide rates vary by sex.
916640	921640	Girls make more attempts, but boys die more often by irreversible methods like guns or
921640	923320	tall buildings.
923320	929280	The boys' suicide rate has fluctuated in recent decades, rising in the 1980s during
929280	935160	the massive wave of crime and violence that waned suddenly in the 1990s.
935160	939960	The rate of suicide in boys reached its peak in 1991.
939960	945800	While the rise, since 2007, does not bring it back up to its peak, it is still disturbingly
945800	946360	high.
959280	966520	Chapter 6.
966520	972600	The decline of play, all work and no play makes Jack or Jill a dull child.
972600	977200	When observed from a distance, child play is an unusual thing.
977200	982640	Peter Lafrener, a developmental psychologist at the University of Maine, points out that
982640	988720	children's play combines the expenditure of great energy with apparently meaningless
988720	989760	risk.
989760	994360	But if nearly all mammals engage in it and if some of them get injured or eaten while
994360	1000840	doing it, there must be some pretty powerful benefits to compensate for the risks.
1000840	1005960	Play is vital for wiring a mammal's brain to develop a functioning adult.
1005960	1011280	Mammals that are withheld from play won't evolve to their full capacity.
1011280	1016000	Genes are crucial for getting the numerous cell lines that begin in the embryo and genes
1016000	1020400	direct brain development toward a first draft in utero.
1020400	1025400	But experience counts too, even while the baby is in the uterus, and after birth it
1025400	1027400	makes a difference.
1027400	1032920	Experience is so important for wiring a large brain that the first draft of the brain contains
1032920	1038960	a strong impetus to develop behaviors that will give the brain the right kind of feedback
1039040	1044920	to build itself for success in whatever environment that happens to surround it.
1044920	1050720	That's why young mammals are always eager to play irrespective of the risks.
1050720	1055000	It's easy to see how this works with physical and social skills.
1055000	1060800	The genes get the ball rolling on the first draft of the brain, but the brain is expecting
1060800	1061800	more.
1061800	1066880	The brain expects the child to engage in thousands of hours of play, including thousands
1066880	1074040	of collapses, bruises, disputes, taunts, coalitions, deceptions, competitions, and acts of exclusion
1074040	1076120	to develop.
1076120	1080640	Children who are deprived of play are more likely not to develop into physically and
1080640	1084440	socially able teens and adults.
1084440	1090040	Research has revealed that nervous children may arouse overprotective behavior from others,
1090040	1095120	such as parents and caretakers, in that this strengthens the child's awareness of danger
1095120	1099600	and decreases their perception of preventing the threat.
1099600	1105240	Overprotection might, however, result in excessive levels of anxiety.
1105240	1109760	Overprotection through governmental control of playgrounds and overstated fear of playground
1109760	1114880	accidents might thus result in a rise of anxiety in the society.
1114880	1121120	Vigorous physical free play, outdoors and done with other kids, is a vital kind of play that
1121120	1143760	our developed minds are expecting.
1143760	1151080	Chapter 7 Wiser Kids How To Build Children That Are Ready For Anything
1151320	1156520	Something is not going well with American teenagers as seen in the statistics on depression,
1156520	1158600	anxiety and suicide.
1158600	1163360	Now that you know that the decline of free play may be part of the reason for children's
1163360	1169960	intensified fragility, this is the best time to prepare your kid for life.
1169960	1175320	You cannot teach anti-fragility instantly, but you can give your children the gift of
1175320	1177200	an experience.
1177200	1182960	The gift of an experience starts with knowing that kids need some unsupervised time to learn
1182960	1188720	how to judge risks for themselves and learn to deal with things like frustration, lethargy
1188720	1191800	and interpersonal disputes.
1191800	1197320	Here are some specific recommendations for parents, teachers and all who care for children.
1197320	1202560	A. Resume that your kids are more competent this month than they were last month.
1202560	1207840	Each month, ask them what challenges they think they undertake on their own.
1207840	1212240	Suppress the impulse to jump in and help them when they're trying to do things and seem
1212240	1214240	to be doing them wrongly.
1214240	1220560	B. Let your kids take more chances and let them learn from getting some bumps and bruises.
1220560	1227480	C. Urge your kids to walk or ride bicycles to and from school at the earliest age as possible.
1227480	1232520	D. Find for your kids a group of kids in the neighborhood who come from like-minded
1232520	1233720	families.
1233720	1239880	E. Find ways for kids to get together in nearby parks or specific backyards.
1239880	1246120	Teaching kids that failures, insults and painful experiences will do lasting damage is harmful
1246120	1247480	in and of itself.
1247480	1253160	Human beings need physical and mental challenges and stressors or we deteriorate.
1253160	1255160	Greg Lukainov.
1255160	1260200	Your worst enemy cannot hurt you as much as your unprotected emotions.
1260280	1264680	Children, like adults too, are inclined to emotional reasoning.
1264680	1270280	They must learn to notice and manage their emotional reactions and choose how to respond.
1270280	1277400	A. Teach children the root of cognitive behavioral therapy, but in many ways it's just cognitive
1277400	1283320	behavioral techniques because the intellectual habits it teaches are good for everyone.
1283320	1289720	B. Teach children mindfulness, limit and refine device time.
1289720	1294280	If given the freedom, many children would spend most of their free time staring at a
1294280	1298600	screen, hence try placing clear limits on device time.
1298600	1303680	Two hours a day seems to be a decent maximum as there is no evidence of negative mental
1303680	1305240	health effects at this level.
1319720	1329400	Conclusion.
1329400	1335280	According to Jean Twenge, a psychologist at San Diego State University, the main cause
1335280	1342280	of the increase in mental illness is the regular use of smartphones and other electronic devices.
1342280	1347680	Less than two hours a day seems to have no harmful effects, but adolescents who waste
1347760	1352960	several hours a day interacting with screens, especially if they start in their early teen
1352960	1358800	years or younger, have poorer mental health results than adolescents who use these devices
1358800	1363200	less and who spend more time in face-to-face social interaction.
1364080	1369360	Our societies are plagued with an interesting set of untruths that are being fed to the young
1369360	1373760	generation, thus fostering fragility and levels not previously seen.
1374480	1379520	There's the untruth of fragility, that of emotional and not objective reasoning,
1379520	1383200	and the variations that exist between good and bad people.
1384080	1389520	There's also the enactment of bad ideas, sometimes with seemingly good intentions.
1389520	1395360	This blunder has been found to manifest in some school administrators and democratic leaders.
1395360	1401840	The greatest implication of the witch-hunting syndrome ubiquitous in our society today is
1401840	1407760	the various forms of segregation that have been birthed. However, the path to societal recovery
1407760	1412960	from degeneration involves molding wiser kids, universities, and societies.
1414000	1419600	Nothing is of more importance to the public wheel than to form and train up youth in wisdom
1419600	1426000	and virtue. Wise and good men are, in my opinion, the strength of a state, Benjamin Franklin.
