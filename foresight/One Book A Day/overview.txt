1. **Encourage Competence**: Recognize and affirm your children's growing competencies each month, resisting the urge to immediately step in to help when they're attempting something on their own.

2. **Permit Risk-Taking**: Allow children to take more risks and learn from their mistakes, understanding that some bumps and bruises are part of growing up.

3. **Promote Active Transportation**: Encourage your kids to walk or bike to school to foster independence and community awareness.

4. **Facilitate Social Interaction**: Help your children form peer groups for play and socialization, emphasizing the importance of face-to-face interactions.

5. **Teach Emotional Regulation**: Teach kids cognitive behavioral techniques and mindfulness to manage their emotions and respond to situations thoughtfully.

6. **Limit Screen Time**: Set clear limits on device usage, aiming for no more than two hours of screen time per day to avoid negative mental health effects.

7. **Challenge the Myths of Fragility**: Counteract the untruths that children are emotionally fragile, that all people are inherently good or bad, and that ideas can harm without evidence.

8. **Promote Academic and Social Wisdom**: Foster an environment where students from all backgrounds feel welcome without resorting to divisive methods, encouraging universities to create a culture that values academic freedom and respectful discourse.

9. **Support Mental and Emotional Development**: Ensure children are exposed to appropriate challenges and stressors, which are essential for their maturation into capable adults who can handle complex ideas and interpersonal dynamics.

In summary, the key to building wiser kids who are ready for anything involves a combination of encouraging independence, allowing them to face and learn from risks, promoting active engagement with their environment, teaching emotional regulation, limiting screen time, and challenging societal myths that contribute to fragility. By doing so, we can help children become stronger, more capable, and better equipped to engage with the world in a positive and constructive manner.
