Report from Santa Fe is made possible in part by grants from the members of the National

00:16.600 --> 00:22.760
Education Association of New Mexico, an organization of professionals who believe that investing

00:22.760 --> 00:29.400
in public education is an investment in our state's economic future, and by a grant from

00:29.400 --> 00:33.600
the Healy Foundation, Taos, New Mexico.

00:33.600 --> 00:37.400
Hello, I'm Loreen Mills, and welcome to Report from Santa Fe.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.800
Our guest today is Kenneth Stanley.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.400
Thank you for joining us.

00:41.400 --> 00:42.400
Thank you, Loreen.

00:42.400 --> 00:43.400
Really happy to be here.

00:43.400 --> 00:47.720
Well, you are an associate professor at the University of Central Florida.

00:47.720 --> 00:52.760
You're a computer scientist, an artificial intelligence researcher, and you're here on

00:52.760 --> 00:55.320
sabbatical with the Santa Fe Institute.

00:55.320 --> 00:56.320
That's right.

00:56.320 --> 00:58.440
So that's how we get to have you.

00:58.440 --> 01:05.440
You are the co-author with Joel Lehman of this fascinating book, Why Greatness Cannot

01:05.440 --> 01:08.960
Be Planned, and the subtitle is?

01:08.960 --> 01:10.880
The Myth of the Objective.

01:10.880 --> 01:12.560
What is the objective?

01:12.560 --> 01:14.960
What do you mean, the myth of the objective?

01:14.960 --> 01:19.800
So when I'm talking about the myth of the objective, I'm talking about the fact that

01:19.800 --> 01:24.840
so many things that we do in our lives and in our culture are guided by what we call

01:24.840 --> 01:25.840
objectives.

01:25.840 --> 01:28.640
Like, it's something that you set that you want to achieve, and you say, this is now

01:28.640 --> 01:33.360
my objective, or this is our objective as a society, or as an institution, or something

01:33.360 --> 01:34.640
like that.

01:34.640 --> 01:39.760
And we believe, and this is like a really deeply entrenched aspect of our culture, that by setting

01:39.760 --> 01:43.200
an objective, it makes it possible to achieve it.

01:43.200 --> 01:47.280
And the message of the book, and the reason we call it the myth of the objective, is that

01:47.280 --> 01:52.520
actually many times, and this is a surprise, having an objective can actually prevent you

01:52.520 --> 01:54.800
from achieving your objective.

01:54.920 --> 02:00.920
So, it is a surprise, and something that we intuit, but the fact that you've come through

02:00.920 --> 02:07.320
it through computer science, and you wonder how many times does a theory in computer science

02:07.320 --> 02:12.360
affect our real life, but you have almost, some have said that this is in a way a scientific

02:12.360 --> 02:14.080
proof of serendipity.

02:14.080 --> 02:17.400
Yeah, I mean, this is a really unusual story.

02:17.400 --> 02:18.400
It's true.

02:18.400 --> 02:24.160
You usually don't end up prescribing social policy based on algorithms in computer science.

02:24.160 --> 02:29.520
And it was a long, you know, circuitous path for us to get from these scientific experiments

02:29.520 --> 02:33.840
to the point where we're actually critiquing certain things about culture and society.

02:33.840 --> 02:35.640
It wasn't our intention from the beginning.

02:35.640 --> 02:37.040
But that's what the whole book is about.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.040
Yeah, it's kind of...

02:38.040 --> 02:41.040
It had been your intention, you wouldn't have been able to do it.

02:41.040 --> 02:44.880
Yeah, I mean, it's like the story behind the book is almost like part of the theme of the

02:44.880 --> 02:45.880
book.

02:45.880 --> 02:47.200
Well, let's tell us that story.

02:47.200 --> 02:52.880
How did you arrive at this through your studies of algorithms and artificial intelligence?

02:53.240 --> 02:58.200
Right, so this is going to sound a little off topic, but actually this is the story

02:58.200 --> 02:59.200
of how we got to it.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.720
We were doing something completely different.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.880
We had no idea we were going to get here.

03:02.880 --> 03:08.760
But we had created a website on the internet, which is called Pick Breeder, where people

03:08.760 --> 03:12.160
can come in and breed pictures.

03:12.160 --> 03:16.040
And I know that probably listeners don't really know what that means to breed a picture,

03:16.040 --> 03:19.200
like you don't mate Picasso with a van Gogh.

03:19.200 --> 03:22.760
But you know, I come from artificial intelligence and in that field, actually, we had been

03:22.800 --> 03:28.760
working on technologies that would allow us to, in effect, give a picture a child.

03:28.760 --> 03:32.880
And just as when you have a child, it might look somewhat like you, but be a little bit

03:32.880 --> 03:34.080
different.

03:34.080 --> 03:40.360
When Pick Breeder images have children, they also look like their parents, but not exactly.

03:40.360 --> 03:44.800
And that allows users to, in effect, breed pictures the way you might breed horses or

03:44.800 --> 03:47.120
dogs or something like that.

03:47.120 --> 03:49.920
So I know that our audience is going to want to go look at this.

03:49.920 --> 03:56.320
So it's www.pickbreeder, P-I-C-B-R-E-E-D-E-R dot org.

03:56.320 --> 04:02.000
So show us some of the images, say a person would go to that site, and then track us down

04:02.000 --> 04:03.800
the amazing work that you had done.

04:03.800 --> 04:07.680
Yeah, so it's really surprising, I think, some of the images that people have discovered.

04:07.680 --> 04:15.440
I'm just going to show a few images that give a sense of what people have discovered.

04:15.440 --> 04:20.760
And you can see that these images actually look like real things.

04:20.760 --> 04:24.200
Like there's a skull there, there's a butterfly, and this is just a small sampling of what

04:24.200 --> 04:25.760
people discovered.

04:25.760 --> 04:30.080
And it's important to point out that people evolved these things from blobs.

04:30.080 --> 04:33.520
That's how things start, just total random blobs.

04:33.520 --> 04:36.040
And they got to these amazing images.

04:36.040 --> 04:40.440
And that's the beginning of the story of how we came to this realization, because we started

04:40.440 --> 04:44.480
to look at how people were making these discoveries.

04:44.480 --> 04:50.040
How people were breeding, say, an image that looks like a car or a skull.

04:50.040 --> 04:55.840
And it turns out, and this is sort of where the insight began, that you might expect that

04:55.840 --> 04:59.760
if you came into this site and you were trying to breed, breed images like you might breed

04:59.760 --> 05:03.040
horses, that you would say, well, I'm trying to breed a butterfly or something.

05:03.040 --> 05:06.120
And then you would sort of pick things that look more and more butterfly-like, and that's

05:06.120 --> 05:08.040
your objective, and then you get it.

05:08.040 --> 05:13.040
And we thought that too, but what we discovered was that, in fact, the only way that any of

05:13.040 --> 05:17.200
these interesting discoveries were being made was when they were not the objective of the

05:17.200 --> 05:18.840
user who bred them.

05:18.840 --> 05:22.800
And this was just a huge revelation for us, completely unexpected.

05:22.800 --> 05:27.440
It blew me over because it contradicted everything that I understood about achievement and how

05:27.440 --> 05:29.400
to get to an objective.

05:29.400 --> 05:36.240
Show us, I think one of the clearest examples is the image of the alien face, which then,

05:36.240 --> 05:41.360
through evolutionary art, as they call this, became the image of a car.

05:41.360 --> 05:46.080
And tell me how many generations it took, but first let's see the image.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.680
So let me show you a picture of this alien face.

05:48.680 --> 05:54.280
This is a story, part of a story about how this initial realization came about.

05:54.280 --> 06:00.440
And this alien face, it's important to note, was not bred by me, it was bred by someone

06:00.440 --> 06:01.440
else.

06:01.440 --> 06:06.360
It had been posted on the site so that I was able to see that it was there, and then I

06:06.360 --> 06:11.200
decided to continue from there, which we call branching.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.400
And here's what happened.

06:13.400 --> 06:17.200
It was several generations, actually I don't know the exact number, maybe 15 generations

06:17.200 --> 06:23.600
or 20 generations, of picking children and continually breeding that then led me to this

06:23.600 --> 06:27.360
really surprising discovery, which is a car.

06:27.360 --> 06:32.600
So what happened, the story is that the alien face was bred into a car.

06:32.600 --> 06:38.320
And what's so important about this is the fact that I had this experience myself, so

06:38.320 --> 06:42.460
I know for a fact I was not trying to evolve a car.

06:42.460 --> 06:46.240
And if you put all that together, I mean just think about how strange this story is.

06:46.240 --> 06:50.360
I chose an alien face, which someone else evolved, it wasn't me, so I wouldn't have

06:50.360 --> 06:52.200
evolved that myself.

06:52.200 --> 06:56.440
And then I evolved a car, which is something that I wasn't trying to evolve.

06:56.440 --> 07:00.560
So someone else had to do something that I never would have done, and then I had to not

07:00.560 --> 07:04.720
be trying to do what I ultimately did for me to make this discovery.

07:04.720 --> 07:09.080
And if you hear that story, it sounds like, wow, that was a big coincidence, you got really

07:09.080 --> 07:10.800
lucky that one time.

07:10.800 --> 07:15.200
But the amazing thing that we discovered is that that actually is always the story.

07:15.200 --> 07:19.280
Almost every interesting discovery in the site has that exact same story.

07:19.280 --> 07:22.760
Somebody evolved something that the other person would never have evolved, and then the second

07:22.760 --> 07:27.200
person kind of took it in a handoff and bred it to a place that they weren't actually trying

07:27.200 --> 07:28.480
to get to.

07:28.480 --> 07:31.440
And that's how you actually find things on Pick Reader.

07:31.440 --> 07:35.720
But one of the most amazing statistics that you told me was that there are some that have

07:35.720 --> 07:43.600
taken 50 generations or 90, 74 generations, but then when you programmed a computer to

07:43.600 --> 07:51.200
do it, to go from the alien to the car, after 30,000 generations, they could not do it.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.960
With that intention of going there, they couldn't.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.720
The computer, try and make it.

07:55.720 --> 08:00.320
This is a really important point, it's really surprising if you think about it.

08:00.320 --> 08:05.080
I mean, what I told you basically is that people find things by not looking for them,

08:05.080 --> 08:09.480
but the converse is also really surprising, which is people do not find things by looking

08:09.480 --> 08:10.480
for them.

08:10.480 --> 08:14.840
Like if you came in there and you wanted to evolve a butterfly, you would fail because

08:14.840 --> 08:18.040
as an objective, it's too hard to actually discover.

08:18.040 --> 08:22.240
And these experiments that you just described are basically confirmation of that fact in

08:22.240 --> 08:28.320
kind of an extreme way by giving it 30,000 generations to try to reproduce an image that

08:28.320 --> 08:29.920
already had been discovered.

08:29.920 --> 08:35.000
So we know it's even possible and every time we tried it, each 30,000 generation attempt

08:35.000 --> 08:40.520
it failed, it never succeeded and it just illustrates that it's sometimes impossible

08:40.520 --> 08:45.480
to reach a destination by trying, even though we know that these destinations can be reached

08:45.480 --> 08:47.120
because they have been.

08:47.120 --> 08:52.040
And I just want to point out again that the image on the cover of your book is one of

08:52.040 --> 08:57.720
the butterflies that was evolved from something completely different without trying to make

08:57.720 --> 08:58.720
a butterfly.

08:58.720 --> 09:04.560
It's just another example and basically every image has that story behind it.

09:04.560 --> 09:06.440
And you know, the reason is kind of important.

09:06.440 --> 09:08.240
So you may ask, well, why is it like that?

09:08.240 --> 09:11.560
You know, why is it that you can only find things by not looking for them?

09:11.560 --> 09:14.600
And the reason is because if you think about it, like if you think about the example of

09:14.600 --> 09:20.560
the car, an alien face led to that car, no one would ever guess that you can get from

09:20.560 --> 09:22.400
an alien face to a car.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.360
If you look closely in hindsight, you can see that...

09:25.480 --> 09:28.520
I think you have a picture of the eyes and the wheels.

09:28.520 --> 09:40.840
Yeah, I can show a connection there that, in fact, the eyes of the alien turned into

09:40.840 --> 09:42.400
the wheels of the car.

09:42.400 --> 09:46.640
And this is something that's only obvious in hindsight.

09:46.640 --> 09:49.560
But looking forward, you would never realize something like that.

09:49.560 --> 09:53.600
And so the point is that the stepping stones, in this case the stepping stone is this alien

09:53.600 --> 09:54.600
face that led to a car.

09:54.600 --> 09:59.000
The stepping stones never resemble the final product, and that's why you would not know

09:59.000 --> 10:03.520
to go through those stepping stones if the final product was your objective.

10:03.520 --> 10:08.360
So the only way you can get to these important stepping stones is by not being single-mindedly

10:08.360 --> 10:10.560
focused on a single objective.

10:10.560 --> 10:14.040
And then you open up all that possibility of eventually reaching these destinations

10:14.040 --> 10:15.640
that were not your objective.

10:15.640 --> 10:21.080
Now I'm going to expand this a little bit because it is as incredible cultural and social and

10:21.080 --> 10:22.960
evolutionary.

10:22.960 --> 10:29.480
So our world is so governed by objectives and talked about goal-oriented, whether it's

10:29.480 --> 10:34.920
test scores, scientific funding, I mean, we could go on and on, bottom line profits, career

10:34.920 --> 10:36.120
tracks, everything.

10:36.120 --> 10:39.080
You have a goal and then you work toward that goal.

10:39.080 --> 10:44.920
And then what you're saying, if the objective paradox is that sometimes you have to give

10:44.920 --> 10:51.120
up that goal to achieve what you, you know, something maybe greater, if your goal is making

10:51.120 --> 10:53.800
a sandwich, it's very clear what the steps are.

10:53.800 --> 11:01.520
But if your goal is to end world hunger or to cure cancer or to make man fly, you shouldn't

11:01.520 --> 11:05.840
be, there's no trajectory that will step by step take you there.

11:05.840 --> 11:07.400
It often hinders you.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.400
Yes.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.560
I mean, and I think, you know, we're making a leap here.

11:10.560 --> 11:16.160
We're going from picture breeding to how really important discoveries happen.

11:16.160 --> 11:21.800
And while this is a strange leap, we should really be concerned when we think about this.

11:21.800 --> 11:26.560
You know, because really the way that discovery happens is no different from pick breeder.

11:26.560 --> 11:31.320
All of us, when we lead, when we discover something, are building on something that was created

11:31.320 --> 11:33.200
by our predecessors.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.440
And those are the stepping stones.

11:35.440 --> 11:41.440
And what this lesson teaches us is that if those stepping stones do not resemble what

11:41.440 --> 11:45.960
we're ultimately trying to achieve, then there's almost no way that we're going to actually

11:45.960 --> 11:49.040
traverse those stepping stones intentionally.

11:49.040 --> 11:54.200
And therefore, we should be worried about a society that's molded in such a way that

11:54.200 --> 11:59.280
we're always trying to constrain everything we do through some kind of objective compass

11:59.280 --> 12:03.160
because the effect is going to be that we prune out the stepping stones, which don't

12:03.160 --> 12:04.720
look like the objective.

12:04.720 --> 12:08.960
And that, in fact, is how we run a lot of our society.

12:08.960 --> 12:16.280
Now, serendipity, let's talk about what great discoveries that have been—I mean, your

12:16.280 --> 12:21.000
book is full of its fascinating read—is full of these ways that—how about Elvis?

12:21.000 --> 12:25.320
Talk to me about Elvis and the microwave and some of your favorite stories.

12:25.320 --> 12:26.320
Yeah, sure.

12:26.320 --> 12:32.360
So the book gives a lot of these examples of—sometimes we call it serendipitous discovery.

12:32.360 --> 12:36.520
And these are really important because they illustrate that this is not just about pick

12:36.520 --> 12:37.520
breeder.

12:38.520 --> 12:43.520
Like Elvis is an example because Elvis was not trying to invent rock and roll.

12:43.520 --> 12:48.960
But he effectively did at least become one of the inventors of rock and roll.

12:48.960 --> 12:54.760
And his colleagues say that he was just playing around and being himself.

12:54.760 --> 12:58.200
And it's almost inconceivable that someone could have an objective of inventing rock

12:58.200 --> 13:01.320
and roll because if you did, then you probably already invented it.

13:01.320 --> 13:04.520
And it just goes to show that there's lots of things like that in life that you're not

13:04.520 --> 13:07.560
going to run across unless you're not trying to create them.

13:07.560 --> 13:10.160
Now, there are more practical things than just rock and roll.

13:10.160 --> 13:13.000
I mean, there's things like the computer.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
I like this example.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.040
You know, the computers—the first computers were made out of vacuum tubes.

13:18.040 --> 13:21.360
So vacuum tubes are a stepping stone that leads to computers.

13:21.360 --> 13:22.920
But here's an interesting fact.

13:22.920 --> 13:27.100
The people who invented vacuum tubes were not thinking about computers.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.280
They were used for electrical experiments.

13:29.280 --> 13:33.200
In fact, if your interest had been in computers, why would you be making vacuum tubes?

13:33.200 --> 13:36.000
It has nothing to do, obviously, with computers.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.680
So it's a good thing that their objective was not to make computers or else we wouldn't

13:39.680 --> 13:41.400
have them.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.640
And these kind of examples, you can go on and on.

13:43.640 --> 13:44.880
The microwave one I like.

13:44.880 --> 13:46.920
The microwave one's another good one.

13:46.920 --> 13:51.080
And this is where Percy Spencer—and this is a very serendipitous thing—where he

13:51.080 --> 13:54.880
had a candy bar in his pocket and he was working on radars, which had microwave technology

13:54.880 --> 13:55.880
in them.

13:55.880 --> 13:59.600
And he noticed that the candy bar melted and suddenly realized, you know what, this actually

13:59.600 --> 14:01.360
leads to a microwave oven.

14:01.360 --> 14:05.480
So you get radar technology as a stepping stone to microwave ovens.

14:05.480 --> 14:09.320
Once again, no way to project looking forward that you go from radars to a new kind of an

14:09.320 --> 14:10.320
oven.

14:10.320 --> 14:14.000
But looking in hindsight, you can see where the connection came in.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.800
And this kind of example happens again and again, and in fact, I just would like to point

14:17.800 --> 14:23.520
the viewers to the Wikipedia page on serendipity, where there are tons of examples like this.

14:23.520 --> 14:26.880
And the suspicious thing about it, the thing that I think people should take note of is

14:26.880 --> 14:31.600
that the people who made these discoveries all have a good track record or all educated

14:31.600 --> 14:34.400
or have been successful in the past.

14:34.400 --> 14:41.720
I mean, if this was just a complete accident, then you wouldn't have these very well respected

14:41.720 --> 14:43.680
people making these discoveries.

14:43.680 --> 14:47.880
So it suggests that—and I think we're going to get to this—that this kind of process

14:47.880 --> 14:49.640
of discovery is not pure random.

14:49.640 --> 14:56.400
You can actually try to fasten your life in such a way that you have more opportunities

14:56.440 --> 14:58.600
to encounter this kind of serendipity.

14:58.600 --> 15:01.760
And this is something as a society that we can also try to facilitate.

15:01.760 --> 15:07.360
Well, we're speaking today with Kenneth Stanley about his new book, Why Greatness

15:07.360 --> 15:08.880
Cannot Be Planned.

15:08.880 --> 15:14.240
But as you described this, again, we have an unconscious understanding, and perhaps it's

15:14.240 --> 15:21.400
artists and musicians the most who understand this.

15:21.400 --> 15:26.120
Talk to me about stepping stones and talk to me about how we can live in a way that

15:26.120 --> 15:31.600
we are aware of these evolutionary steps.

15:31.600 --> 15:32.600
What do you call it?

15:32.600 --> 15:33.600
Treasure hunter.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.600
What is it?

15:34.600 --> 15:36.040
Who would be a treasure hunter?

15:36.040 --> 15:37.680
How do we become treasure hunters?

15:37.680 --> 15:42.760
Yeah, so the natural question that follows from the story that I've kind of given so

15:42.760 --> 15:46.360
far is, well, how do we make this happen?

15:46.360 --> 15:49.920
It sounds nice that, well, we can all just do whatever we want.

15:50.040 --> 15:53.840
What's the real formula here that actually someone can key in on?

15:53.840 --> 15:57.280
And the answer is that when you look at a system like Pick Breeder, what we're actually

15:57.280 --> 16:00.320
observing when we came to understand what was happening, why people were making all

16:00.320 --> 16:05.600
these discoveries, is that the system as a whole, the website in this example, is collecting

16:05.600 --> 16:06.880
stepping stones.

16:06.880 --> 16:11.120
Every time someone comes to that website and discovers something and publishes it to the

16:11.120 --> 16:16.600
community, everybody can see it, like the alien face that I saw that I eventually evolved

16:16.600 --> 16:17.600
into a car.

16:17.600 --> 16:18.600
That's a stepping stone.

16:18.600 --> 16:23.520
And the more stepping stones people publish, the more opportunities or departure points

16:23.520 --> 16:25.840
are created for further discovery.

16:25.840 --> 16:29.120
And that's what I mean by a stepping stone collector.

16:29.120 --> 16:35.200
And it's in our interest to try to fashion society, especially the parts of it that are

16:35.200 --> 16:39.160
focused on innovation or discovery, as a stepping stone collector.

16:39.160 --> 16:42.040
And I sometimes also, like you said, call it a treasure hunter, because you can think

16:42.040 --> 16:43.520
of these as treasures that are sort of buried.

16:43.520 --> 16:44.520
We don't know what they are.

16:44.520 --> 16:48.480
It's not an objective, but we know that there's lots of interesting stuff out there.

16:48.680 --> 16:53.120
And we go hunting and trying to uncover them as much as we can.

16:53.120 --> 16:54.640
You're used to the word interesting.

16:54.640 --> 17:01.320
So you have created a noun, I don't know if it exists, called interestingness, right?

17:01.320 --> 17:07.200
And you say that the scent of interestingness can lead us across these chains of stepping

17:07.200 --> 17:10.120
stones into who knows what.

17:10.120 --> 17:14.120
But because we do this, because it's interesting, and when people are choosing those images,

17:14.120 --> 17:15.600
it's just the one that kind of interests them.

17:15.600 --> 17:18.640
They're not thinking about the ratios or the proportion.

17:18.640 --> 17:23.600
And so when you're guided by your own instincts, where will this take you?

17:23.600 --> 17:24.600
Yeah.

17:24.600 --> 17:27.800
So we tend not to trust people's instincts.

17:27.800 --> 17:32.840
I mean, that's one of the morals here, is when we talk about interestingness, that's

17:32.840 --> 17:35.680
the scent you have to follow if you don't have an objective.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.920
You know, you're saying, well, which path should I follow?

17:38.920 --> 17:42.120
And you don't know where any of them lead, because there's no objective.

17:42.120 --> 17:45.760
That doesn't mean that you can't make an intelligent decision.

17:45.760 --> 17:49.680
Often people will follow the path that's most interesting to them.

17:49.680 --> 17:54.560
And what we've kind of done as a culture is decided that that's not a legitimate thing

17:54.560 --> 17:55.560
to do.

17:55.560 --> 17:59.960
In other words, we say that just about anything that you do has to somehow be objectively

17:59.960 --> 18:01.120
validated.

18:01.120 --> 18:03.880
You have to say what your objective is, and then we have to prove that you're actually

18:03.880 --> 18:05.680
moving towards that objective.

18:05.680 --> 18:09.880
Which means that nobody can get away with actually following the scent of interestingness.

18:09.880 --> 18:13.640
If you think about, you know, accountability and metrics, and these things are pervasive

18:13.640 --> 18:18.000
in our society, they're all objectively driven, and they're all pruning out this concept of

18:18.000 --> 18:22.800
interestingness, which ultimately means we don't trust people to use their instincts

18:22.800 --> 18:27.360
or their expertise, and we think it's too risky to let them do that, and so we're pruning

18:27.360 --> 18:31.720
out all of the creative possibilities that those people could potentially uncover.

18:31.720 --> 18:37.120
So here we have the objective paradox, which is to achieve our highest goals.

18:37.120 --> 18:39.360
We must be willing to abandon them.

18:39.360 --> 18:44.000
And then how can we create an environment for ourselves to go against the myth of the

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
objective?

18:45.000 --> 18:47.840
Because you're saying working toward an objective is not going to do it.

18:47.840 --> 18:50.960
So you have posited a day without objectives.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.640
What would that do?

18:52.640 --> 18:57.720
And you say that not meeting our objectives, which are superimposed on this, or come from

18:57.720 --> 18:59.760
within, is very stressful.

18:59.760 --> 19:03.400
You feel like an underachiever because you didn't win the Nobel Prize today.

19:03.400 --> 19:09.040
And how would society be different just even if we could take some time off from objectives?

19:09.040 --> 19:10.520
For kids, for example.

19:10.520 --> 19:11.520
Yeah.

19:11.520 --> 19:15.120
I mean, and you could think about this in the context of the education system where

19:15.120 --> 19:19.920
people just saturated with things like standardized tests.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.800
And this is no doubt.

19:21.800 --> 19:26.320
Most people have an instinct that this is having a bad effect on children.

19:26.320 --> 19:33.040
And we've done experiments, further experiments, beyond Pick Reader, where we actually formalized

19:33.040 --> 19:35.000
Pick Reader in a computer program.

19:35.000 --> 19:40.280
We called it Novelty Search, which we used to kind of demonstrate and show that it is

19:40.280 --> 19:46.600
actually possible to implement this principle in practice and use it to make discoveries

19:46.600 --> 19:47.600
that are useful.

19:47.600 --> 19:51.040
And one of the things that we found in these experiments is that allowing things to make

19:51.040 --> 19:56.720
mistakes and do things that we think are objectively perhaps bad or subpar actually leads them

19:56.720 --> 20:02.160
eventually to discovering really important skills and abilities.

20:02.160 --> 20:06.040
And so that might be a difference if we could allow people to do that, is that we would

20:06.040 --> 20:11.920
get to places that we couldn't get to in a more efficient and also satisfying way.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.960
Well, you talk about it being a different path to achievement.

20:14.960 --> 20:21.000
And you did have, in the Novelty Search, you had a program where you created the jogger.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.120
And I think you have an illustration of this jogger.

20:25.120 --> 20:33.440
And the jogger's job was to go down through these walls.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.440
And well, tell me.

20:34.440 --> 20:35.440
Tell me what you're...

20:35.440 --> 20:42.440
Yeah, so we made this program, which is a kind of demonstration of this principle, this

20:42.440 --> 20:44.960
non-objective principle.

20:44.960 --> 20:48.640
And you know, Pick Reader has humans in the loop, humans are making decisions.

20:48.640 --> 20:52.200
We wanted to show that we can do this completely inside of a computer, partly because I'm

20:52.200 --> 20:53.280
an AI researcher.

20:53.280 --> 20:57.160
So people in my field want computers to do stuff on their own that's intelligent.

20:57.160 --> 21:02.040
But usually in the field of artificial intelligence, if you were making a program to train a robot

21:02.040 --> 21:05.800
to walk, and here I'll show a picture of what this robot looks like.

21:05.800 --> 21:09.460
This is a robot in different kind of steps of walking.

21:09.460 --> 21:15.640
Usually if you were trying to do something like this, you would reward the robot in some

21:15.640 --> 21:17.840
sense for getting better at walking.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.840
So it's like if it can get farther, it's better.

21:19.840 --> 21:23.480
And then we would elaborate on that strategy, and then we get better and so forth.

21:23.480 --> 21:29.020
What we did is we created this program called Novelty Search, which does not try to improve

21:29.020 --> 21:30.520
with respect to walking.

21:30.520 --> 21:34.280
Rather, it just says you're doing a good job if you're doing something different than

21:34.280 --> 21:35.880
you've done before.

21:35.880 --> 21:38.800
And so it falls on its face, it does all kinds of stupid things.

21:38.800 --> 21:41.600
But if it falls on its face in a different way, that's good.

21:41.600 --> 21:42.840
We say great.

21:42.840 --> 21:46.360
That means that that's a stepping stone that we should explore further to see what might

21:46.360 --> 21:48.880
happen if we elaborate on that idea.

21:48.880 --> 21:53.480
And in so doing, eventually it actually led to walkers, and it actually led to walking

21:53.480 --> 21:57.880
robots that walk better than the ones that were trained by rewarding them for trying

21:57.880 --> 21:58.880
to pursue the objective.

21:58.880 --> 22:05.240
So it kind of demonstrated this point in a real concrete, scientific, empirical way.

22:05.240 --> 22:11.040
So one of the things that you say, it's sometimes better to start from where you are instead

22:11.040 --> 22:12.400
of where you want to go.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.920
Talk to me about the Wright brothers.

22:15.360 --> 22:20.960
So when you think about objectives, what an objective really is, it's about comparing

22:20.960 --> 22:24.520
where you are to where you want to be.

22:24.520 --> 22:29.600
And when you talk about something like novelty, which is not an objective concept, novelty

22:29.600 --> 22:33.840
is basically comparing where you are to where you've been before.

22:33.840 --> 22:35.840
And for some reason, we don't like doing that.

22:35.840 --> 22:38.960
We want to always compare ourselves to the future.

22:38.960 --> 22:42.960
But something like the Wright brothers, we can view, sometimes that's used as a counter

22:42.960 --> 22:43.960
example.

22:44.400 --> 22:47.400
They wanted to build something that can fly, and then they did.

22:47.400 --> 22:51.880
But we can also view it as the Wright brothers were at the right stepping stone at the right

22:51.880 --> 22:57.880
time and realized that right at that moment, the stepping stones had been laid.

22:57.880 --> 23:01.680
So this is where they are right now that have suddenly enabled us to move in a direction

23:01.680 --> 23:02.680
towards.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.800
And they were bicycle manufacturers.

23:04.800 --> 23:05.800
They were making bicycles.

23:05.800 --> 23:06.800
Yeah, right.

23:06.800 --> 23:10.120
So in some sense for them, a bicycle was a stepping stone that kind of made an analogy

23:10.120 --> 23:11.120
with a plane.

23:11.120 --> 23:14.120
And they saw that you can bridge that gap.

23:14.120 --> 23:20.320
So sometimes it makes sense to just sort of appreciate the possibilities of where you

23:20.320 --> 23:25.180
are, as opposed to saying this is this long term vision that we need to achieve and everything

23:25.180 --> 23:26.840
I do will now be compared to that.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.560
We only have a couple of minutes left.

23:28.560 --> 23:32.480
Steve Jobs talks about this a lot.

23:32.480 --> 23:36.680
Because he was in college, he dropped out, he took a calligraphy class, he said, only

23:36.680 --> 23:40.120
looking back, can I see how one thing led to another?

23:40.120 --> 23:45.840
And that's why Apple and his products were as beautiful and as sensible as they were.

23:45.840 --> 23:49.840
Yeah, I mean, Steve Jobs, he could have been a co-author of this book because his life

23:49.840 --> 23:53.480
was really kind of lived in the spirit.

23:53.480 --> 23:57.680
And like this calligraphy class that he took, and he didn't know that this was going to

23:57.680 --> 24:03.120
lead to a revolution in computer fonts, until in hindsight he saw that a connection was

24:03.120 --> 24:04.120
there.

24:04.120 --> 24:05.120
And he has a lot of stories like this.

24:05.120 --> 24:08.040
He dropped out of college and that's what allowed him to take the calligraphy class.

24:08.040 --> 24:13.400
And most people would not think of dropping out of a college as an objectively good decision.

24:13.400 --> 24:18.240
So a lot of people have done great things, have followed this philosophy in some sense.

24:18.240 --> 24:23.060
Well, you have taken your research in the physical world into the metaphysical.

24:23.060 --> 24:29.040
And there's overtones of Zen Buddhism and a lot of paths that say, if there's no destination,

24:29.040 --> 24:32.200
every path is the right path, because it moves you along.

24:32.200 --> 24:36.680
In the last part of your book, I just want to read this beautiful sentence of yours.

24:36.680 --> 24:40.880
It's called, farewell to the...

24:40.880 --> 24:41.880
Farewell to the mirage?

24:41.880 --> 24:42.880
That's the chapter.

24:42.880 --> 24:43.880
The mirage of object.

24:43.880 --> 24:44.880
Right.

24:44.880 --> 24:47.980
This mirage that objectives can get you where you want to go.

24:47.980 --> 24:54.200
And you say, when all is said and done, even when visionaries grow weary of stale visions,

24:54.200 --> 25:00.520
when the ash of unrequited expectation settles on the cloak of the impenetrable future, there

25:00.520 --> 25:04.320
is but one principle that may yet pierce the darkness.

25:04.320 --> 25:09.080
To achieve our highest goals, we must be willing to abandon them.

25:09.080 --> 25:10.080
Yeah.

25:10.080 --> 25:11.920
I mean, that sort of recaps the book.

25:11.920 --> 25:14.520
That's the concluding paragraph.

25:14.520 --> 25:17.720
And it's a difficult pill to swallow.

25:17.720 --> 25:19.040
It sounds strange.

25:19.040 --> 25:23.080
Giving up objectives is like giving up a security blanket.

25:23.080 --> 25:27.360
But I hope that the evidence there is compelling enough to make people think twice about using

25:27.360 --> 25:32.080
objectives for almost everything that we do in our culture, because it is going to lead

25:32.080 --> 25:36.400
to this kind of ash falling on the cloak of the impenetrable future.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.800
Yes.

25:37.800 --> 25:39.880
And your book is full of examples.

25:39.880 --> 25:47.320
I mean, from history that we all know and understand of people who have given up their

25:47.320 --> 25:51.920
stated objective just to find out and discover what was out there.
