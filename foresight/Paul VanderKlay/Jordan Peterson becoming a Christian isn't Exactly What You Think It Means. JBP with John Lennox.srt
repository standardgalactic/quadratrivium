1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
Hi, this is Paul. A lot of people have been asking for me to do some work on this conversation

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,720
between John Lennox and Jordan Peterson. It's a good conversation. It's a conversation

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,520
that I think a lot of Christians have been waiting for. But before I talk about it, I

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:25,120
want to contextualize it a little bit because YouTube sort of has this culture where it's

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,600
tribal match of red rover where you're just, you know, let's have Jordan come over and

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,480
Jordan will come over into the, first the battle will be into the Christian camp and

7
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,720
then the battle will be between the Orthodox and the Catholics and the Protestants and

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,960
how many versions of Protestants and alignment with Pope Francis or against Pope Francis

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,800
or, I don't even know the intramurals the Orthodox have, but I certainly imagine they

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:58,160
do have their own intramurals. So I want to contextualize this a little bit because today

11
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,720
I released the video where I talked about Jordan Peterson and Bill Maher. And part of

12
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:10,120
me, before I release a video like that, part of me knows that's going to bang, hit, you

13
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:15,000
know, number one of the last 10 videos. YouTube analytics kind of shows you that thing. And

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,640
a lot of people will watch that and the comment section will sort of get flooded with four

15
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,200
against Jordan Peterson stuff and yada, yada. And this, this kind of thing, I just sort

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:31,200
of endure. Part of me would far rather put out a video that mostly people from the corner

17
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:40,200
watch and the usual suspects sort of put comments below and we can sort of continue to process

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:47,480
these conversations, this drama, these journeys as we go along instead of sort of having the

19
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,440
internet of hot takes and the internet of beefs sort of take over the comment section

20
00:01:52,440 --> 00:02:03,440
and cloud the conversation. Part of me would love to see people just sort of sit back, sit

21
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:09,560
back and, and think a little bit more thoroughly about what exactly we're looking for from

22
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:16,560
Jordan with respect to this religious question. Because if you, if you think about it more

23
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:23,080
than your tribal instinct sort of jumps onto you for more than a minute, especially if

24
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:29,280
you, let's say, don't have a personal relationship with Jordan Peterson, meaning you don't have

25
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,080
a kind of friendship where you have his cell phone number and you can text him and he'll

26
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:39,040
text right back, or you can call and then go out to coffee and such and such. And the

27
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:46,080
vast majority of us do not, myself included, what, what really is our participation in

28
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,560
this game? And to me, it's sort of connected to this much broader cultural game that we

29
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,160
play of participation with the heavenly host of people we see on the screens and what they

30
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:06,160
believe and what they don't believe. And I, I, I touched that a little bit when on Twitter

31
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,520
the other day, I just caught that Heather Hying and Brett Weinstein were doing a live

32
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,440
stream and that, and so I just, I wonder what they're talking about. So I just click over

33
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,280
there for a minute or two, try to get a sense of what they're talking about. And then Brett

34
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,600
sort of looks across the table at Heather with a, with really a lovely look. And when

35
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:31,760
I saw them at ARC, I said to them, you know, complete, completely apart from all of the

36
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,080
kinds of things that I could sit down and have 10 hours of conversation with Brett about

37
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,240
with respect to religion, which would probably go absolutely nowhere. I just wanted to say

38
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,480
to them, you know, one of the things I really love about your channels is the way that you

39
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,120
two interact with each other. And Brett was just looking adoringly at his wife. And I

40
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:57,120
thought that alone is an enormous thing on the internet, just to have a happily married

41
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,960
couple who are thinkers and talkers, regardless of whether you think they're right and wrong

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,600
on, on how many different issues they're doing something good in the world, just by, just

43
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:17,480
by being married well on camera before the internet. Now, is that everything I could

44
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,160
always hopefully ask for? No, of course not. Do I have other ideas about religion and other

45
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,840
desires about what people would have in their life with respect to their belief and their

46
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:33,440
religion? No, of course I do. But a little bit of, a little bit of understanding about

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,640
how small we are today, I did a Randall's conversation with someone that I, that came to

48
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,760
the Washington conference and probably a good number of the Randall's conversations will

49
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,080
be behind the $3 membership thing, not because I'm trying to keep it from people, but just

50
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,080
because many of the people that have conversations with, they want to tell their story and they

51
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,560
don't really want their story on the whole open internet. And so, you know, if you're

52
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,080
really interested in it, $3 a month, you can unsubscribe at any time. If you want to go

53
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,480
and look and watch the Randall's conversations, there they are. Will there be other Randall's

54
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:10,920
conversations not behind the paywall? Absolutely. But that's probably where they're going to be

55
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,360
because many people have the sense to maybe not just share everything in their story out

56
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,400
on the internet all the time for anyone to see just passing by. Not that $3 is a huge

57
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:29,560
barrier to find out, but the truth is, it's just going to keep things there. Anyway, so

58
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,440
I asked one of the questions I usually ask people, which was, well, how did you find

59
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,880
my channel? And he told me the story and I, he had been unemployed for a little period

60
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,840
of time and he was watching a lot of critical drinker and he'd kind of been through all

61
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,400
the critical drinker videos. And then I popped up and first there was this horror that, oh,

62
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,280
either this is going to be an angry old man shouting at the sky or it's going to be some

63
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,920
evangelical pastor who's trying to use pop culture to wheedle his way in to get that

64
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:05,080
message across. And what he discovered was, of course, something a little bit different.

65
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,080
And then he watched a video after video and even cared enough to come to a conference in

66
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,240
Washington, DC. And then at the conference say, I'd really love to do a Randall's conversation

67
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:23,400
with you. So we set that up and we did it today. All that to say is people have lives and the

68
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:31,320
development of their faith or non faith is a very subtle extensive process, only part of

69
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,200
which, and this is what I talked with Rafe Kelly a little bit about, only part of which is actually

70
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:42,720
sort of accessible to us in real time in terms of our awareness and our consciousness. So much of

71
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:50,480
this is happening at levels in our, even within our own cognition, but also in the cognition that

72
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:57,360
happens between us in the world at levels we don't simply understand. And in my opinion, the best

73
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,200
language we have for describing that is language about the work of the Holy Spirit, language about

74
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,960
the spirits and principalities and powers. That's why I use that language because it's that level

75
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:19,680
that all of these transactions are underway. And that is as true for Jordan Peterson as it is for

76
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:26,720
any of us. If you're really curious about Jordan's faith development, the video I would actually

77
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,480
recommend is one that just popped up on my feed, Tammy Peterson Rosary testimony. It's a beautiful

78
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:45,120
little film about Tammy's cancer and her healing. And you gain a lot of insight into what is probably

79
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:52,880
the most formative relationship of Jordan Peterson's life. And the miracle that rescued Tammy from

80
00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:04,520
cancer, and I'll call it a miracle, is something that impacts her family deeply. And as the news came

81
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:11,960
out recently, she has begun the process to become an adult convert to Catholicism. And I pray that

82
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:19,280
this process is a beautiful one. And, you know, there could be a bunch of Protestants, there's stuff

83
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,840
in this video that are going to trigger some Protestants and fair enough. But as I said to the

84
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,880
rando and the randos conversations, they said, what piece of advice were you given that sort of

85
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:35,520
sticks with you? And I had to stop and really think and who gave it to you. And the one the one

86
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:41,600
thing that I said to him was one thing that I learned from my father is pick your battles. And

87
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,280
what picking your battles is all about is keep the first things the first things. And whether or

88
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:53,400
not the miracles trigger you or the rosary triggers you or the Virgin Mary triggers you or

89
00:08:53,400 --> 00:09:01,400
Catholicism triggers you or whatever triggers you. Here's a woman that had a new lease on life. And

90
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:10,320
the story is intimately connected with a Catholic worker who came close to her in her moment of

91
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,720
need. The relationship that she has with her son, she talked about how, you know, when she was

92
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,720
diagnosed with cancer, she told her son and it just he was just, you know, floored by this. Of

93
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:28,360
course he was. And anyone will tell you, especially priests will tell you that the rosary is not

94
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:35,120
sort of a magic cure all to to beat cancer. There's a reason we call things miracles.

95
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:41,360
I'm waiting on a plumber. He said he'd be here at two o'clock. It's three o'clock and he's not

96
00:09:41,360 --> 00:10:00,240
here. It's the way it goes sometimes with people, but when I think about this story, I think about

97
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:07,120
the providence of God and the work of God in the world and the work of God, even in YouTube and

98
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:15,360
between us and in all of these little comings and goings. I know I probably, a lot of you have

99
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,960
already clicked away because you were just looking for Jordan Peterson, John Lennox, dumb, dumb, dumb.

100
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:31,120
No, no, let's take our time because these are people and think about them as people and think

101
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:39,440
about what molds them and shapes them. And because as a pastor, I will tell you it is these journeys

102
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:47,360
in life that mold and shape people. And if you are a pastor or a priest, what you work with is the

103
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:54,960
care of the soul. And in many ways, it's deeply intertwined with the care of the story. And

104
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:04,160
this is what we work on. Now, I'll go desperately wanted me to watch a recent video by Apologetics

105
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:11,440
Roadshow in which the Apologetics Roadshow guy brought out this Peter Atkins, Unbelievable.

106
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,880
I think this is probably part of the big conversation series that Justin was doing a

107
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,800
number of years ago. And what this clip basically demonstrates is exactly the point that C.S. Lewis

108
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:36,480
makes in the beginning of his book, Miracles. I ball for evidence, heaven forbid. I find that

109
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:44,000
very difficult question. I'm just interested, what sort of evidence could science or the physical

110
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,280
universe present to you that would make you think actually that that is evidence that there's a

111
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:59,680
mind behind this? I find that a very difficult question. If I were looking in the Bible for

112
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:11,600
evidence, heaven forbid, I would expect to see maybe increase in entropy as equal to Q reversible

113
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,040
divided by temperature. And that is, if there was literally an equation in the Bible like that,

114
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:26,800
rather than all this wishy washy elastic writing that it pervades. This is so interesting because

115
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,480
wishy washy elastic writing, but then he goes on. Something like that, that they discovered in the

116
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:39,600
Bible. Well, exactly. The problem is, would it actually make you, I mean, is there anything from,

117
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,520
you know, is there any kind of evidence in the universe that could make, I mean, if the stars

118
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:49,680
lined up to spell, Peter, please believe in me, it's about time. I put it down to madness.

119
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,960
To personal madness. It sounds like, Peter, that there's no evidence that will persuade you away

120
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,600
from atheism. Well, to be honest, I think that's probably the case. In that sense, do you even

121
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:09,360
have an evidence based view if you're actually committed to atheism a priori? Well, I'm predicting

122
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,760
that there will be no such evidence. That's not quite the same thing as being committed to it,

123
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,160
a priori. I can't. But you said there's no evidence that would persuade you otherwise.

124
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:30,160
I think it's much more likely that I would have gone mad than such evidence would have been provided.

125
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:40,560
It's a brilliant clip. It's a brilliant clip. And again, CS Lewis makes this point at the beginning

126
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,560
of his book, Miracles, and he uses it with its completely other illustration. He says,

127
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,640
the only person that I ever know that the only person that I've known who has

128
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:55,360
claimed to have seen a ghost doesn't believe in ghosts. This is the way we work. You know,

129
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,200
all this talk of evidence, yadda, yadda, yadda, this stuff has been YouTube

130
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:05,840
boilerplate with atheism versus Christians forever. And the whole thing is hogwash.

131
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:12,640
People believe or they don't believe. And most of what goes into their belief or unbelief

132
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:19,920
is by no means the product of some rationalist calculation. And this is one of the big points

133
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:28,960
that John Vervakey makes. And he's dead on right. You know, reason has more to do with

134
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:39,360
relationship. This conversation that John, now I'm bringing every video into this video before

135
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,200
I even get to the video that I sort of said I was going to do, but that's okay.

136
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,400
I'm going to make a proposal for which I think there's an argument. It's based on

137
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,040
convergence of quite a few people's work, but perhaps most important to me right now is the

138
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,160
work of James Filler and his book on Neoplatonism, Heidegger, and the history of being, which is

139
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:04,000
relation as ontological ground. And his proposal is what the Neoplatonists had argued is that

140
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,680
contrary to an Aristotelian Cartesian framework, substance, individually, independently existing

141
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,280
things are not the ultimate ground of reality. Relation is. So it's not that relations emerge

142
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,520
from the things related, but the things related emerge from this field of relationality. You

143
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:26,640
can hear whitehead here, and you can also surprisingly hear physics, both that upper

144
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,440
end of relativity and the lower end of quantum. So this idea of relationality and what's really

145
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,680
important about that is it binds reality to information, which is inherently relational,

146
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,680
intelligibility that's inherently relational. And why am I going on about this? Well, think about

147
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,240
what you just said. You said the Christian idea and the Trinity, and this is Filler's argument,

148
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,760
too. The Trinity is, if properly understood, and I think the Eastern Orthodox Church fathers,

149
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,040
I know you might be Catholic or something. I don't mean to be insulting, but people like,

150
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,240
you know, Dionysus. There's a lot of sharing, a lot of these church fathers across the Protestant

151
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:09,360
Catholic Orthodox realm. Yes. And Maximus, one Western person, Erogena,

152
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:18,400
and also Nicholas of Cusa, who is Catholic, really make this very strong proposal that the

153
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:28,720
Trinity is actually a way of trying to exemplify that the ultimacy, that ultimacy is inherently

154
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:37,120
relational. And then if sacredness is about connectedness, about this dynamic reciprocally

155
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:43,120
open, reciprocally opening relationality, we can see why sacredness seeks ultimacy.

156
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,800
Just explain to me how you're using the word ultimacy. I don't think I've got this.

157
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:55,200
Ultimacy means, okay, so your life depends on an everyday practical distinction between

158
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:01,040
appearance and reality, things that are illusory versus the things that are real. Okay. And it's

159
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,400
interesting that if you do a, like McGee and Barbara, if you do research into what is a necessary

160
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,120
feature of wisdom, it's the ability to see through illusion and into reality. That's one of the

161
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:20,000
defining features of the wise person. So notice something though, that we can only judge one

162
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,880
thing as illusory by comparing it to something that is real. There's a point made by Plato and

163
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,040
Marlo Ponti. So saying that everything's an illusion, actually it's like saying everything

164
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:36,160
is tall. It doesn't make any sense, right? Real is a comparative term. It's an

165
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:45,200
inherently comparative term. And then what we're doing is we're seeking what, what is that against

166
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,440
which all the comparisons are made. And all the work on, you know, when people experience what

167
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,920
they call the really real and mystical experience, it shows that people will, so what happens?

168
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,080
Yaden's work, when people, let's say they have a mystic and they encounter the really real,

169
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,040
they change their lives, their relationships, because they want to be in closer conformity.

170
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,520
So there's this, I want to be one with what is most real. That's what I'm meaning by

171
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:17,920
ultimate. And then what I'm saying is, go back to this picture that I was showing.

172
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,040
So if you want to get a sense of, let's say, Jordan Peterson's heart, now he said many,

173
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:30,400
many times that, well, you know, the details, the details of his personal convictions with

174
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:38,880
respect to the define or private classical modernist move. But the most, I think John

175
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:51,840
Vervecchi is right there. Relationality is what brings the facts, the building blocks, the things,

176
00:18:51,840 --> 00:19:02,080
the stuff into right relation in our lives. Because again, this is sort of a basic thing

177
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,800
that we've been talking about in the corner for a very long time. You've heard commentatorial

178
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:12,480
explosiveness here in this room here in my messy office, there are, I could spend the rest of my

179
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:19,520
life just focusing on the things in this office and the relationality between this and that. But

180
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,440
relationality does is sort of stack things up in a value hierarchy. And then suddenly

181
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,680
it's the relation value hierarchies, of course, comparative relationality between this and that.

182
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:39,760
And so when Tammy Peterson is deathly ill with cancer, that no one survives. And Jordan has

183
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:51,120
acafesia from getting off these benzos and Michaela is running him to Russia. I saw, I probably won't

184
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,760
live long enough to read the definitive biography of these people, but it is going to be the most

185
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:06,560
insane book. It is going to be so good because their lives are quite, quite remarkable. And

186
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:14,400
everybody just sort of wants to have a little internet game. Is he or isn't he? What is he or

187
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:22,480
what isn't he? Or he's this or he's that? People, yes, you can talk about people that way. Those

188
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,880
are useful categories. We use them all the time. We have to because it's shorthand and because

189
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,760
lives are short yada yada yada. But when it comes to higher and higher resolution with respect to

190
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:42,560
people and our relations with them, deeper things matter. Now, the first thing to know about John

191
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:48,240
Lennox, if you've been around the internet apologetics community or at least around

192
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,480
unbelievable long enough, you know who this guy is. Now he kind of sits there and he kind of looks

193
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:03,280
like a grandpa. He's not wearing a fancy suit and his hair is kind of over the place and his

194
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:14,800
eyebrows are sticking up and you might think, do not think that for a minute. I call this guy

195
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:25,680
the Irish apologetics kung fu panda because he is sharp and he has his act together with respect

196
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:30,640
to these things. And this is the reason Justin Breyer Lee has had this guy opposite Peter Atkins.

197
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,480
Opposite, I don't know how many people again and again and again and again because he is no dummy.

198
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:43,680
He's been around the church. He's been around the faith. He's a mathematician. I mean, he is a very

199
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:52,880
sharp cookie and sort of this happy laid back older guy thing just lures you in and then he's

200
00:21:52,880 --> 00:22:02,080
got you. That is John Lennox. That is who this man is. And so it's really cool that one way or another,

201
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:10,960
you know, he and Peterson are in a conversation together and now there are conversations that

202
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,640
Jordan has that go badly because Jordan steps on them. He gets excited about what he wants to say

203
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,800
and it's like, you might as well take the other person out of the room Jordan because you're

204
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:26,640
basically, you could do what I do and just line him up on a video and then just go off on your own.

205
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,280
But not this conversation. This conversation really goes well. And I said all of that sort of to

206
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:39,040
frame it because what does Jordan believe in his heart? Well, you can ask, you can go back and look

207
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:45,200
at Jordan, talk about faith, go back to that. What is it? Lawrence College? St. Lawrence College?

208
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,400
Well, maybe this is the plumber. No, it's not the plumber.

209
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,840
And when Jordan says, you know, what about religion? And he says, well, you know, this talk,

210
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:04,480
this chattering thing about what you think you believe, that's a far secondary importance

211
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,400
than how you act and what you act from. And that idea is true. And it should sober both

212
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:17,200
Christians and non-Christians alike because a great deal of what pastors major in in church is

213
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:24,160
getting Christians to actually sort of live out their belief. And it's very dangerous for atheists

214
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:30,640
because they sort of live out Christian belief from layers beneath them. This video is going to

215
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,960
come out after my eye and Hershey, I leave video and where I talk about some about that.

216
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,320
So what Jordan is doing here is comparing notes because

217
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,120
even though at this certain level, Jordan keeps getting asked about, does he believe in God? Yada,

218
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,560
yada, yada. There's a lot more going on about this. And Jordan's been thinking hard about this

219
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:58,400
stuff. And he's been testing people when he gets the chance. And now he's got someone in the room

220
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:07,600
that he clearly respects. And he wants to do some note comparing. And I can't think of a better guy

221
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,840
for him to talk to. Here we go. So I wanted to start by asking you your opinion on some

222
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:19,440
questions that have gone through my mind recently. And there's one that's very specific, I think

223
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:26,400
I'll start with, which is that, you know, I think for, for a lot of my life, and certainly when I

224
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:34,640
was younger, I really bought the doctrine that there was an unbridgeable gap between the scientific

225
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,080
way of looking at the world and the Christian way of looking at the world, let's say. And

226
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:48,960
that the split, the split, the apparent split between science and religion was a consequence

227
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:56,720
of an incommensurate dichotomy of worldviews, you know, and that the church had been opposed to

228
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:03,040
scientific progress, at least in part because the scientific viewpoint existed in contradiction to

229
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:10,320
Christian doctrine. We sold the fridge. I discovered someone had, this is the weird

230
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:17,040
stuff that happens at church, part of the introduction or the interruption. Someone

231
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:23,200
had stored a whole bunch of things of potato chips in the freezer, at least been in that

232
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,680
freezer for like before the pandemic. Well, you're still good. So it gives the pastor a little snack.

233
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:37,680
Anyway, back to it. Sure. But then, especially in recent years, in the last 10 years,

234
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:46,800
I've started to understand that that was something like a French Enlightenment slash

235
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:55,200
rationalist propaganda campaign, and that there's a different, that the relationship between

236
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:03,120
science and Christianity is much closer than I had imagined. I caught on to this a little bit by

237
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:11,120
reading Jung, but that just as the universities develop, I love the fact that he used the word

238
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:19,440
cotton down to it. And those, these subtle things are helpful because they help a broader range of

239
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:28,000
people listen to Peterson. Anyway, out of the monastic tradition, the notion that the natural

240
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:36,480
world was intelligible to the inquiring logos, that it had an intrinsic logic that studying it

241
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,880
would be beneficial to man, first of all, that it would be comprehensible and beneficial, and that

242
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:50,480
that was actually a kind of moral obligation. That all struck me as like axiomatic statements of

243
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,880
faith that were predicated on the Christian tradition that were the preconditions for the

244
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,080
emergence of science. And, you know, I've tried to take that idea apart over the last three or

245
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:08,240
four years to see if I can find any flaws in it. But I think the evidence that the universities

246
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,480
emerged out of the monastic tradition, instead of emerging contrary to that, that's absolutely

247
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:21,200
incontrovertible on every grounds you could possibly imagine. And the notion that you need to believe

248
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:27,360
in the intelligibility of the world, the capability of the human logos, and the,

249
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:33,120
and the beneficial consequence of acquiring knowledge, you have to believe in all that to

250
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,840
even get the scientific enterprise going. I also think that's incontrovertible and that those are

251
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:44,800
axioms of faith. And so I don't know how, I don't know if those views are in accordance with your

252
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,840
views or what you think about that. So I'd like to hear what you think about that. This is extremely

253
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:58,400
interesting to me because I never saw the tension between Christianity and science because very

254
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:05,040
early on as a teenager, I was introduced to the writings of a scientist who was a Christian

255
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:13,760
who drew my attention to something Alfred North Whitehead wrote. And it was really put in much

256
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:20,160
simpler language by C.S. Lewis when he wrote, men became scientific because they expected

257
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:25,600
law and nature, and they expected law and nature because they believed it a law giver.

258
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:33,040
And so very early on, and I was fascinated by the idea that actually modern science

259
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:41,040
is a legacy of the biblical worldview. And therefore it's no accident that the pioneers,

260
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:49,280
Galileo, Kepler, Newton, Maxwell, and so on were believers in God. And as you pointed out,

261
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:56,400
it underpins the tradition that lies behind the great universities of the world, that the doctrine

262
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:05,280
of creation was actually the belief, the underlying presupposition that allowed people to do science.

263
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:12,000
So I've come over my life to the conclusion that science and the biblical worldviews sit very

264
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,200
comfortably together, but it's science and atheism that do not sit comfortably together,

265
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,200
which I know is quite a controversial statement, but at least it gets discussion going.

266
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:30,880
Now, when I was in, I'm going to say the word again, all of you Scots out there,

267
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:41,440
Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Edinburgh, New College, having a festival, Alistair McGrath made similar

268
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:52,720
points. And again, we're facing what was sort of a, I mentioned in previous video, a lot of what

269
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,120
has sort of reverberated through the last century was the modernist fundamentalist fight.

270
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:10,640
And that fight was, it was certainly on the American scene. It was in Europe. And I think,

271
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:21,520
in many ways, it's that fight that sort of set up the imagination that these two things are at odds,

272
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:27,440
but I'll have to look for that McGrath video. We'll see if it's up yet. The university sometimes

273
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,000
can be really slow about putting their stuff up. They have last year's up. Yeah, see, they've got

274
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,400
NT Wright and they've got Rowan Williams, but they don't have this year's up yet. Anyway, when it

275
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:43,280
gets up, I'm going to keep looking for it because Alistair McGrath's talk, I thought was excellent,

276
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:48,560
and it touched on this. Completed a couple of documentaries with the Daily Wearer Plus crew,

277
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:54,560
and one of them was in Athens and two were in Jerusalem. And we were trying to puzzle out the

278
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:03,600
relationship between Greek thought and Judeo-Christian thought, most particularly the strange

279
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:12,320
happenstance that the Greek idea of an intrinsic logos in the world seemed to dovetail with the

280
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:20,080
Judeo-Christian idea of, you might say, of the word incarnate in the human psyche. And

281
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:28,000
it seemed to me and obviously to other observers that there was an affinity between the Greek

282
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:35,920
idea that the cosmos had an intrinsic comprehensibility and the idea that the proper orientation

283
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:42,400
for human beings ethically would be one of honest communication and investigation. And

284
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:48,960
those two things snapped on top of each other. It made me think of something that I actually

285
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:55,280
learned from Richard Dawkins, and I think this is a deep idea. Dawkins wrote a very influential

286
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:05,120
essay where he claimed that any organism that can function in an environment has to be a microcosm

287
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:12,560
of that environment. So for example, if you were an alien biologist and you were presented with a

288
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:20,320
terrestrial bird and you took the bird apart, you could infer from the bird's structure the

289
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:26,960
gravitational pull of the earth, the density of the atmosphere, the chemical composition of the

290
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:34,560
atmosphere, the electron. Remember what Viveki said about relationality? Now sort of here is

291
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,560
implicit that well sort of the environment comes first and then the bird comes second.

292
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:44,960
But of course the environment and the bird are of course, they're working at different speeds,

293
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:54,640
but they are also both changing. And so it's sort of the correlation between the two. And again,

294
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:01,440
the conceptualization of the two itself is also a product of a lot of this. But the correlation

295
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:09,920
of the two is in fact this relationality. The electromagnetic frequency that the sunlight

296
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:16,480
was, what would you say, at what electromagnetic frequencies the sun's light was most amenable

297
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:25,440
to vision, etc. You could derive a model of the environment from the physiology of the organism.

298
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:32,240
Now I know that there were medieval ideas that were deep in Christianity that the human soul

299
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,360
was a microcosm of the cosmos, that it reflected the structure of reality itself. And I've been

300
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:44,240
thinking about this in terms of how the world might be best conceptualized. So there's a mix

301
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:51,120
of ideas here. And if an organism has to be a microcosm of the cosmos in order to function,

302
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:59,280
and we are a microcosm in that regard, and we are a personality that runs on a narrative,

303
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:06,240
which we seem to be, then in what way is it reasonable to claim that the cosmos itself

304
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,760
is best conceptualized as something that could be entered into relationship with

305
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:17,200
personality to personality, and that that's not the most fundamental reflection of reality. I mean,

306
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:24,160
it seems to me that that's where Dawkins thought eventually points, if his proclamation that

307
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:30,560
an organism has to be a microcosm, an accurate microcosm in order to survive is accurate. So

308
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:39,120
now that. Long, long time ago, for those of you who have been watching this channel for years,

309
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:49,120
and there are a few thousand of you. Pascal, spirit of finesse, spirit of geometry,

310
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:55,120
should have been triggered by this. Years ago, when I was talking to John Varvakey about this,

311
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:01,920
when I, when I first came across, you know, it's interesting how much Pascal is in Lewis,

312
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:08,160
as I've been reading this biography of Lewis by Alistair McGrath. I should really do a much

313
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,240
deeper dive into Pascal himself, because Pascal seemed to figure a lot of the stuff out. And,

314
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:20,480
of course, Pascal was very early in, you know, early modern period. But this, basically, I hear,

315
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:27,520
I hear Peterson talking about, this is the spirit of finesse, that the way and this sort of connects

316
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:37,280
up with the mode that you have to enter into when dealing with persons is the appropriate mode for

317
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,400
religion. Now, the spirit of geometry is an appropriate mode. This also sort of maps on to

318
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,320
Ian McGilchrist's two hemispheres of the brain. But the spirit of finesse is the proper mode,

319
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,880
because now take this, this idea that he brought from Dawkins. The reason that

320
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,960
religion is shaped the way it is, and this is where Peter Atkins is told, well, there's, if

321
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,400
there's an equation in it, no, you don't understand. And every time Brett Weinstein starts talking about

322
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:12,720
this updating of wisdom, and that the old rules, and he's thinking about that religions are these,

323
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,640
these books of rules, and what religious people are, is they just keep following these little

324
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,440
rules. Now, again, rules are handy things, and rules are good things, and rules are fine. But you

325
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:27,840
cannot sort of reduce everything down to these little rules, because of this divide that Pascal

326
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:32,720
noted between sort of these two modes, the spirit of finesse and the spirit of geometry,

327
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,120
rule-based is sort of geometry, you can reduce geometry down into a bunch of rules.

328
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:46,400
But you can't pursue life that way. And I think John Revecky runs through well,

329
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,440
why sort of this rule-based approach doesn't work, because of commentatorial explosiveness,

330
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:59,440
because the number of rules that you would need, multiplies infinitely, because of the

331
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,400
commentatorial explosiveness of the world. Now, if you don't know what commentatorial

332
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,320
explosiveness is, you can go watch Awakening for the Meaning Crisis, it's this thing that I run

333
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:12,240
through. It's the basis of what led Jordan to a whole bunch of this, that via cognitive science,

334
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:17,680
what we do when we engage productively with the world is a massive compressive and reduction

335
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:24,480
effort to sort of break the world down into sizable parts that we can productively engage

336
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:32,880
with. In other words, we engage with the logos of the world productively, because things sort of

337
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:40,000
scale and they fractal down. I don't know if that made any sense to you, but it made sense to me.

338
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:46,880
Dovetails with the idea that the logos as a personality, so that would be the Judeo-Christian

339
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,920
concept, can investigate the logos of the universe and that those things dovetail. So now, I know

340
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:00,320
that's a conflict. And of course, the image of God is in there too. We are made in God's image,

341
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:08,480
and this personality, this personhood, this spirit of finesse, this mode of person, of relationality

342
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:16,640
is, in fact, the mode that we properly, we are like God in that way. We are children of God in

343
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,200
that way. Paul uses that phrase in the book of Acts. And...

344
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,920
...mismash of ideas, but I'm interested in your thoughts on that.

345
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,280
No, those are good ideas, Jordan.

346
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:35,920
Well, I think there's a lot in that actually. And I recall listening to you, you have a very

347
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:42,880
interesting lecture on Genesis 1. And when you came to this statement that human beings are made

348
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:49,760
in the image of God, you paused and you pointed out that this was the cornerstone of our civilization.

349
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:56,800
And I agree with that entirely. I think that what Dawkins is saying actually points to the exact

350
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,880
opposite direction to what his worldview is, which is atheism, of course. In other words,

351
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:10,880
that we can read off from creation something about the idea of a creator.

352
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:20,560
Now, we got to clean up this language. Atheism, of course. Okay, that's a shorthand for

353
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:31,200
that there is no governing, there is no governance of the, there is no personal governance of the

354
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:38,480
universe that we can relate to. So often, when we talk about God, this is what we're talking about.

355
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,440
And will Christians believe they can relate to the personal governance of the universe?

356
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:50,400
And Jordan Peterson basically made the argument that our person, our person ship, and I would,

357
00:39:51,760 --> 00:40:00,080
I would push his argument even further that the evidence of the productivity of our person ship

358
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:09,200
in the universe and the capacity of the personal to colonize, and C.S. Lewis again goes through

359
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:15,360
this quite a bit in his book, Miracles, to colonize and manage and master the impersonal

360
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:24,400
is suggestive of the very fabric of the universe that the universe, in fact, is personal. Now,

361
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,560
one might argue, he's gonna flip this around and play devil's advocate that this is only

362
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:38,800
projection on our part. The difficulty with that argument is the universe seems receptive to person

363
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:49,360
hood. What C.S. Lewis does in Miracles is he uses reason and what's really helpful is to recognize

364
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:55,760
the ancient relationship between reason and this logos that Peterson is talking about. I

365
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:02,640
noticed this in Romans 12 on Sunday. You can see I have my Sunday school class up on the channel too,

366
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,080
but very famous passage. Therefore, I urge you brothers and sisters in view of God's mercy

367
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:12,320
to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God. And this is your

368
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,680
Lexham English Bible says reasonable service. And if he says true and proper service,

369
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:25,600
the RSV translation I grew up on was spiritual worship. And well, what is that? What is that?

370
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:34,160
What is that word beneath it? Well, it's this funny word that its root is in, its root is in logos.

371
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:42,160
And sometimes it's translated reasonable or rational and sometimes it's translated spiritual.

372
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:48,240
Well, what does that mean? What is the connection? Because if you would ask a modern, the logical

373
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:54,480
and the spiritual would seem out of source, but not if the spiritual is basically held together

374
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:02,240
and managed by the logos. It's the logos. It's, it's logos is the proper worship because you're

375
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:11,920
worshiping in line with the logos. So, so C.S. Lewis, there is then a God who is not a part of

376
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,280
nature, but nothing has yet been said to show that he must have created her. Might God and nature

377
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,040
both be self-existent and totally independent of each other? If you thought, and this is sort of

378
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:28,480
what you imagine, say, a sky daddy or super thing or something with something of that nature.

379
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,560
If you thought you would be a dualist and you would hold a view in which I consider manlier

380
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:39,440
and more reasonable than any form of naturalism, you might be many worse things than a dualist,

381
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,640
but I not fit, but I do not think dualism is true. There's an enormous difficulty conceiving two

382
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,760
things which simply coexist and have no other relation. If this difficulty sometimes escapes

383
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,720
our notice, that is because we are victims of picture thinking. We really imagine them side

384
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:01,360
by side in some kind of space, but of course, if they are both in a common space or a common time

385
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:07,520
or any kind of common medium whatsoever, they both would be part of a system and in fact of a nature.

386
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,280
Even if we succeed in eliminating such, such pictures, the mere fact of our think, of our

387
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,320
trying to think of them together slurs over the real difficulty because for that moment anyway,

388
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:23,920
our own mind is a common medium. If there can be such a thing as sheer otherness,

389
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:31,280
if things can coexist and no more, coexist and no more, it is at any rate conceptual in our mind

390
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:37,840
cannot form. And in the present instance, it seems especially gratuitous to try to form it,

391
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:43,040
for if we already know that God and nature have come into a certain relation, they have at the

392
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:50,560
very least a relation almost in one sense a common frontier in every human mind. The relation

393
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:56,240
which arises at that frontier are indeed the most complicated and intimate sort. That spearhead of

394
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:03,680
the supernatural capital S, which I call my reason links up to all my natural contents, my sensations,

395
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:10,080
emotions and the like. So completely that I call the mixture by a single word me. Again,

396
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:16,400
that is what I came called the unsymmetrical character of the frontier relations.

397
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,520
When the physical state of the brain dominates my thinking, it produces only disorder,

398
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:27,440
but my brain does not become any less a brain when it is dominated by reason capital R. Now again,

399
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:33,840
if you hear reason, you think, oh, Sam Harris, think of reason more as right relation.

400
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:42,160
And think of reason in terms of this Greek word, which is, has its roots sort of in this logos,

401
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,960
because that's sort of the thing that holds it together. It's this common medium.

402
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,080
The military metaphor of a spearhead is perhaps apparently ill-chosen. The supernatural reason

403
00:44:54,080 --> 00:45:01,360
enters my natural being not like a weapon, more like a beam of light which illuminates

404
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:08,480
or a principle of organization which unifies and develops. Our whole picture of nature being

405
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:16,000
invaded, as if by a foreign enemy, was wrong. When we actually examine one of these invasions,

406
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,800
it looks much more like the arrival of a king among his own subjects, or a Mahut visiting

407
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,800
his own elephant. You have an elephant in a rider image. Look at that. The elephant may run amuck.

408
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,680
Nature may be rebellious, but from observing what happens when nature obeys,

409
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:42,640
it is almost impossible not to conclude that it is her very nature to be subject. All happens

410
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:52,640
as if she has been designed for that very role. And this, I think, is really what they are driving

411
00:45:52,640 --> 00:46:00,320
at here. That, well, science seems to give us knowledge. Now, it can give us knowledge in

412
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:05,360
certain domains. Science struggles, in fact, to give us knowledge of itself, as John Verveke

413
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:12,480
points out numerous times. But the fact that it works as well as it does, even with us, suggests,

414
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:21,440
as C.S. Lewis says, that it is in fact a king, not science is the king, but personhood is the king,

415
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:31,040
and the immaterial world is, in fact, nature, or the material world is, in fact, nature.

416
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,760
And that's the kind of thing that we have, we experience in white technology,

417
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:43,280
is such a deep temptation for us because suddenly we are filled with our sensation of

418
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:50,000
our mastery over the world. And this, again, connects back up with the image of God.

419
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:58,320
And as you say, it dovetails perfectly. Let me put this another way. I'm a mathematician by

420
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:03,760
background and a linguist. I love language, and mathematics is a very sophisticated language,

421
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:11,040
but I love natural languages as well. And it seems to me that where this fits together best

422
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:19,920
is first in the fact that we can do science in the sense that there is a rational intelligibility

423
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:26,640
to the universe, which is the foundation of modern science and is a legacy of the biblical

424
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:33,440
worldview, so that the mathematical describability Einstein talked about,

425
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:40,080
he couldn't imagine any genuine scientists without faith in that. It's the axiom for doing

426
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:45,600
science is to believe the universe is intelligible. But if you ask for the rationale behind that,

427
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:54,880
again, not just intelligible, subjectable, that the universe in fact is subject to us,

428
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:00,720
and this, of course, is Genesis 1. Now, to the degree to which we are good stewards of this power,

429
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:07,520
the universe rebels against us because our subjection of it is not the kind of proper

430
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:13,760
subjection, but let's say the good master has to its dog who loves and cares for his dog.

431
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:20,160
Rafe and I talked about this in our conversation, but in fact, the exploiter who does not care

432
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:28,960
for the domain to which he has been given dominion, but in fact merely exploits and abuses.

433
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:36,400
We believe the universe is intelligible. It bears the imprint of a creator, and I see that at the

434
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:43,680
level of mathematics in its capacity to, at least in part, gives a handle on what's out there,

435
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:49,520
and also biology, where we have at the heart of every living cell the longest word we've ever

436
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:56,640
found, the genetic code. And all of that leads me to formulate it as follows, that we live in a

437
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:04,640
word-based universe, and that's the key of the Logos for me. Okay, and so what do you mean in that

438
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:10,640
case? So what do you mean specifically that we live in a word-based universe? What does that mean

439
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:17,600
for you on the broader conceptual landscape? Well, now that's a super important question,

440
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:23,120
because again, I believe in God. I don't believe in God. The book of James says, well, the devils

441
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:29,600
believe in God. They perhaps in some ways have clearer knowledge of God. If you think about

442
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:33,840
knowledge in terms of propositional knowledge, if you think about knowledge in terms of this

443
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:40,800
disembodied, abstract saber, if you use Spanish instead of cono sed, this kind of knowledge,

444
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:51,040
they certainly have that, but how about intimate knowledge? How about relational knowledge? Because

445
00:49:52,480 --> 00:50:00,160
it's that's where all of this begins getting interesting. You can know that the girl across

446
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:08,880
the classroom is named Fulana, but to know her personally is a whole other thing.

447
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:19,200
Well, it means that this universe is not simply a product of natural unguided forces. It is a

448
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:25,200
product of a rational creator, an intelligent creator, and I believe even more than that,

449
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:33,200
a personal creator. Now, how I get there is only in part from a response to the universe as I find

450
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:41,440
it, the point you made about each organism being a microcosm of its environment. It's also, it seems

451
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:48,080
to me that there are two sources, two major sources of knowledge. There is, first of all,

452
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:55,760
observing the universe, science, etc. Then there are the humanities, but there's also the concept of

453
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:03,120
revelation in which I believe. In other words, it's not simply the human quest for the creator,

454
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:09,760
it's the creator revealing himself. So, for me, the anchor point in the end is that the

455
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:17,760
logos became human and we beheld his glory. In other words, we can see exactly what this means

456
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:25,760
in terms of what we can understand. That is the human being in which God encoded himself in Christ.

457
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:30,480
Those are big ideas, of course. They're very deep ideas. They need unpacking,

458
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:37,040
but that's essentially where I'm coming from. Okay, so now Lennox is going to bring out

459
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,680
argument made by Alvin Plantinga, made by C.S. Lewis, made before Lewis. I forget exactly who

460
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:50,960
Lewis cites for this argument, that in fact, if the universe is a product of randomness, would you

461
00:51:50,960 --> 00:52:01,280
entrust yourself to this type of product? I'm jumping ahead a little bit, but this gets into

462
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,920
some of that and it gets into, again, the combinatorial explosiveness that you need.

463
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:11,280
Facts need prioritization. That's what values do. Again, Peterson's talked about this quite a bit

464
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:19,040
and he continues working through this. The scientific truth that's truest and beneficial

465
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:25,680
simultaneously is actually the conjunction in this Athens Jerusalem sense. It's actually the

466
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:33,120
conjunction of the intrinsic logic of the objective world making itself manifest to the

467
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:38,800
truthful penetrating psyche of the human observer. It's the interaction between those two that

468
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:45,280
constitute scientific truth and not one or the other. There's no getting, see, and what the

469
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:51,760
atheist materialists would like to do is to say, well, the world of facts speaks for itself,

470
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:56,080
but that's also technically untrue because there's an infinite number of facts.

471
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:01,280
They're certainly not all relevant. We can drown in the plethora of facts. That's the

472
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:07,120
combinatorial explosiveness point. We certainly will do that and to even communicate about them

473
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:13,120
or study them or even draw our attention to them. We have to prioritize and hierarchically arrange

474
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:18,480
the facts and we do that according to an ethic and I think that's actually, I think that is

475
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:24,720
incontrovertible on scientific grounds because we have seen the emergent realization in a whole

476
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:31,440
variety of domains, AI not least, that there are facts, but those facts have to be prioritized

477
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:36,880
and you prioritize facts with an ethic. That's absolutely right. There's a deeper problem

478
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:43,440
it seems to me with the atheist understanding of science and that is this. And again,

479
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:53,280
this yes or no God has become shorthand for a whole bunch of other consequential beliefs

480
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,200
and ideas. And so he says, atheist, okay, they're going to fight over this word again,

481
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,960
but his point is, well, what exactly is the nature of the universe? Is the universe intelligible?

482
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,440
And if the universe isn't intelligible, what are the implications of that intelligibility?

483
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:15,920
And what are the implications if in fact, our intelligibility is merely illusory?

484
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:22,800
That we do the science with our minds. Some people think the mind and the brain are the same. I

485
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:29,360
leave that aside since you're an expert on the mind and the brain. But I often say to people,

486
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:35,200
you know, what do you do science with? I've asked many leading scientists this,

487
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:40,960
they say, well, I do it with my mind and my brain. Give me a brief account of the brain.

488
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:46,160
And they say to me, well, the brain is the end product of a mindless, unguided process.

489
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:52,320
And I pause and I look up straight at the eye and I smile and I say, and you trust it. Tell me

490
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:58,480
honestly, if you knew that the computer you use or the machinery you use in the lab

491
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:04,560
was the end product of a mindless, unguided process, would you trust it? And the interesting thing,

492
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:10,240
I've done a lot of experiments with this little story and I've always got the answer, no, I would

493
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:16,400
not. So I say, you have a problem. In other words, your atheism is undermining the very

494
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:22,080
rationality you use not only to do science, but to construct any argument whatsoever. It's not

495
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:27,040
only shooting itself at the foot, it's worse than shooting itself at the brain. Let me,

496
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:36,240
and there's an example of John Lennox. Now this is a killer argument. And as again,

497
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,240
it's at this point that you just have to say, okay, he just landed a killer argument.

498
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:48,560
Do all the atheists just say, oh, okay, well, no, we don't change world views that way.

499
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:55,360
Just like, okay, Fulana comes over and introduces herself. Okay, well, it's going to take time,

500
00:55:55,360 --> 00:56:02,240
it's going to take process, because all of this getting to know one another and know what the

501
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:07,280
world looks like from a different point of view, and know the implications of all of these ideas,

502
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:14,400
and even how in fact, these ideas that we are sort of crunching in this part of our mind,

503
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:20,720
which is conscious, is related to sort of the emergence of the ideas. Well,

504
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:27,760
we don't know. Now Peterson is about to go through this, and it's a very interesting thing because

505
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,680
he says, you know, these ideas appear to us. This is like revelation. Now that's,

506
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:40,960
that itself is a whole other interesting idea. And, and it's, I think it's a powerful point. I

507
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:48,560
don't know if, if I can go as far with it as Peterson would like to go with it, because,

508
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:55,840
and I don't think it's, I don't think it's wrong-headed, but it gets, it gets again to this

509
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:04,080
point that what is, what is it exactly that you want from Jordan? If Jordan would suddenly go

510
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:12,640
to a church, if Jordan would suddenly go to your church, well, you'd probably be excited and giddy

511
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:17,600
about that for a day or an hour, or maybe even a whole week or a month. But after that, it would

512
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:22,640
just kind of become normal things. And then in fact, if you had a little church fight in your

513
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:30,800
church over the color of the carpet, or others over some doctrinal, doctrinal position, etc, etc,

514
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,520
and Jordan was on the other side of it, you'd be annoyed with him.

515
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:45,200
These conversations are excellent because what they help us do is continue to process these,

516
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:53,760
that they help us do the work of engaging with a world

517
00:57:54,560 --> 00:58:06,240
that is filled with the logos of God. And the process isn't just about sort of getting our

518
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:12,720
thoughts straight, we have to do that. I had a person come up to me just last Sunday, and somehow

519
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:19,920
I quote Lewis a lot in my sermons, and, and she came up to me and she's a dear, lovely, wonderful

520
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:29,200
woman. And she said, you know, I got this book, Mere Christianity, and I started reading it,

521
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:37,840
and it's hard, I don't understand it. And some of you might say, mere Christianity,

522
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:44,240
that's the easy one, read miracles, or even read his scholarly stuff, you know,

523
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:52,240
preface to Paradise Lost, or his Oxford English Literature book, or, you know,

524
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,720
yeah, Lewis can get a lot harder than Mere Christianity. Mere Christianity was pitched

525
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:06,800
to a radio audience in England during the war. But for many people, that's just not the wavelength

526
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:12,400
that they're at, and all the think-y-talk-y stuff. For some of us, that's, you know, that's where things

527
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:20,000
are, and that's absolutely fine. But for many people, they aren't. And it's amazing how much sense

528
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:27,920
people can make through sort of this personal relationship mode. And I think, in fact, it's

529
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:35,440
a deeply powerful mode, and it's the mode that, in fact, in many cases trumps the other mode.

530
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:42,400
People don't care how much you think until they, until they, people don't care how much you know,

531
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:47,680
until they know how much you care. There's only these little pastor turnaround things that are

532
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:54,000
semi-easy to remember. You can see I didn't remember it right the first time. But anyway,

533
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,280
I don't, I don't know how much more I'll do with this video, as with all the daily wire things,

534
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,520
there's another half hour. I haven't actually listened to the last half hour. I very much want

535
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:09,840
to, because I very much enjoyed this conversation. And this has been the conversation that Christians

536
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:16,320
have been waiting for. But I don't think, in the end, a lot of people who are sort of playing the

537
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:21,520
tribal game are going to get out of the conversation what it is they're looking for. Well, maybe some

538
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:28,080
will, and that's great. But, you know, even, even with all the drama around Diane, Hersey, Ali,

539
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:36,960
there's a, there's a, it's sort of like Tom Brady winning the Super Bowl. I won the Super Bowl.

540
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:44,000
I won it again. I won it again. I won it again. And he doesn't quite know when to retire.

541
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:51,440
But winning the Super Bowl isn't what it was. Now, you can apply some of Peterson's

542
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:58,080
ideas about meaning, how meaning is always in the reaching, not in the grabbing.

543
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:07,120
And I think there's a lot of truth to that. And I think, again, the truth is that in this world,

544
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:13,920
we are always reaching, and the receiving comes in Christian terms, and this is what

545
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:18,320
Christians actually call it, the consummation. And you might say, consummation, that's a funny

546
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:27,360
word. Well, it's the same word that happens after the consummation of the marriage. It's a deep form

547
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:37,120
of knowing. It's not just knowing that. It's consummation. So maybe that's enough for this.

548
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:44,080
I'll keep an eye on the comments and we'll see, because there's a lot of videos I want to treat.

549
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,600
There's a lot of stuff out there, but this, this was a good one. I absolutely recommend

550
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:56,800
watching it, but it's not, I don't even know what people are looking for with respect to the whole

551
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:07,120
Jordan Peterson Christian or no thing. It certainly is building a lot of popularity on

552
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:14,320
YouTube channels, but I don't think that game is what we think it is. Anyway, leave a comment.

553
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:15,040
Let me know what you think.
