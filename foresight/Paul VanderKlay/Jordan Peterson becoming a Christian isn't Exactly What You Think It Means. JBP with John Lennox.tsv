0	6880	Hi, this is Paul. A lot of people have been asking for me to do some work on this conversation
6880	11720	between John Lennox and Jordan Peterson. It's a good conversation. It's a conversation
11720	16520	that I think a lot of Christians have been waiting for. But before I talk about it, I
16520	25120	want to contextualize it a little bit because YouTube sort of has this culture where it's
25760	32600	tribal match of red rover where you're just, you know, let's have Jordan come over and
32600	37480	Jordan will come over into the, first the battle will be into the Christian camp and
37480	40720	then the battle will be between the Orthodox and the Catholics and the Protestants and
40720	45960	how many versions of Protestants and alignment with Pope Francis or against Pope Francis
45960	50800	or, I don't even know the intramurals the Orthodox have, but I certainly imagine they
50880	58160	do have their own intramurals. So I want to contextualize this a little bit because today
58160	63720	I released the video where I talked about Jordan Peterson and Bill Maher. And part of
63720	70120	me, before I release a video like that, part of me knows that's going to bang, hit, you
70120	75000	know, number one of the last 10 videos. YouTube analytics kind of shows you that thing. And
75000	79640	a lot of people will watch that and the comment section will sort of get flooded with four
79680	84200	against Jordan Peterson stuff and yada, yada. And this, this kind of thing, I just sort
84200	91200	of endure. Part of me would far rather put out a video that mostly people from the corner
91200	100200	watch and the usual suspects sort of put comments below and we can sort of continue to process
100200	107480	these conversations, this drama, these journeys as we go along instead of sort of having the
107520	112440	internet of hot takes and the internet of beefs sort of take over the comment section
112440	123440	and cloud the conversation. Part of me would love to see people just sort of sit back, sit
123440	129560	back and, and think a little bit more thoroughly about what exactly we're looking for from
129560	136560	Jordan with respect to this religious question. Because if you, if you think about it more
137080	143080	than your tribal instinct sort of jumps onto you for more than a minute, especially if
143080	149280	you, let's say, don't have a personal relationship with Jordan Peterson, meaning you don't have
149280	153080	a kind of friendship where you have his cell phone number and you can text him and he'll
153080	159040	text right back, or you can call and then go out to coffee and such and such. And the
159080	166080	vast majority of us do not, myself included, what, what really is our participation in
167240	172560	this game? And to me, it's sort of connected to this much broader cultural game that we
172560	179160	play of participation with the heavenly host of people we see on the screens and what they
179160	186160	believe and what they don't believe. And I, I, I touched that a little bit when on Twitter
186440	192520	the other day, I just caught that Heather Hying and Brett Weinstein were doing a live
192520	197440	stream and that, and so I just, I wonder what they're talking about. So I just click over
197440	201280	there for a minute or two, try to get a sense of what they're talking about. And then Brett
201280	205600	sort of looks across the table at Heather with a, with really a lovely look. And when
205600	211760	I saw them at ARC, I said to them, you know, complete, completely apart from all of the
211760	216080	kinds of things that I could sit down and have 10 hours of conversation with Brett about
216120	222240	with respect to religion, which would probably go absolutely nowhere. I just wanted to say
222240	225480	to them, you know, one of the things I really love about your channels is the way that you
225480	230120	two interact with each other. And Brett was just looking adoringly at his wife. And I
230120	237120	thought that alone is an enormous thing on the internet, just to have a happily married
237560	243960	couple who are thinkers and talkers, regardless of whether you think they're right and wrong
244000	250600	on, on how many different issues they're doing something good in the world, just by, just
250600	257480	by being married well on camera before the internet. Now, is that everything I could
257480	262160	always hopefully ask for? No, of course not. Do I have other ideas about religion and other
262160	265840	desires about what people would have in their life with respect to their belief and their
265840	273440	religion? No, of course I do. But a little bit of, a little bit of understanding about
274000	279640	how small we are today, I did a Randall's conversation with someone that I, that came to
279640	284760	the Washington conference and probably a good number of the Randall's conversations will
284760	289080	be behind the $3 membership thing, not because I'm trying to keep it from people, but just
289080	293080	because many of the people that have conversations with, they want to tell their story and they
293080	297560	don't really want their story on the whole open internet. And so, you know, if you're
297560	302080	really interested in it, $3 a month, you can unsubscribe at any time. If you want to go
302080	305480	and look and watch the Randall's conversations, there they are. Will there be other Randall's
305480	310920	conversations not behind the paywall? Absolutely. But that's probably where they're going to be
310920	315360	because many people have the sense to maybe not just share everything in their story out
315360	321400	on the internet all the time for anyone to see just passing by. Not that $3 is a huge
321440	329560	barrier to find out, but the truth is, it's just going to keep things there. Anyway, so
329560	333440	I asked one of the questions I usually ask people, which was, well, how did you find
333440	339880	my channel? And he told me the story and I, he had been unemployed for a little period
339880	343840	of time and he was watching a lot of critical drinker and he'd kind of been through all
343840	349400	the critical drinker videos. And then I popped up and first there was this horror that, oh,
349400	353280	either this is going to be an angry old man shouting at the sky or it's going to be some
353280	358920	evangelical pastor who's trying to use pop culture to wheedle his way in to get that
358920	365080	message across. And what he discovered was, of course, something a little bit different.
365080	369080	And then he watched a video after video and even cared enough to come to a conference in
369080	373240	Washington, DC. And then at the conference say, I'd really love to do a Randall's conversation
373280	383400	with you. So we set that up and we did it today. All that to say is people have lives and the
383400	391320	development of their faith or non faith is a very subtle extensive process, only part of
391320	396200	which, and this is what I talked with Rafe Kelly a little bit about, only part of which is actually
396200	402720	sort of accessible to us in real time in terms of our awareness and our consciousness. So much of
402720	410480	this is happening at levels in our, even within our own cognition, but also in the cognition that
410480	417360	happens between us in the world at levels we don't simply understand. And in my opinion, the best
417360	424200	language we have for describing that is language about the work of the Holy Spirit, language about
425040	429960	the spirits and principalities and powers. That's why I use that language because it's that level
429960	439680	that all of these transactions are underway. And that is as true for Jordan Peterson as it is for
439800	446720	any of us. If you're really curious about Jordan's faith development, the video I would actually
446720	453480	recommend is one that just popped up on my feed, Tammy Peterson Rosary testimony. It's a beautiful
453480	465120	little film about Tammy's cancer and her healing. And you gain a lot of insight into what is probably
465120	472880	the most formative relationship of Jordan Peterson's life. And the miracle that rescued Tammy from
473080	484520	cancer, and I'll call it a miracle, is something that impacts her family deeply. And as the news came
484520	491960	out recently, she has begun the process to become an adult convert to Catholicism. And I pray that
492160	499280	this process is a beautiful one. And, you know, there could be a bunch of Protestants, there's stuff
499280	504840	in this video that are going to trigger some Protestants and fair enough. But as I said to the
504840	509880	rando and the randos conversations, they said, what piece of advice were you given that sort of
509880	515520	sticks with you? And I had to stop and really think and who gave it to you. And the one the one
515520	521600	thing that I said to him was one thing that I learned from my father is pick your battles. And
521600	527280	what picking your battles is all about is keep the first things the first things. And whether or
527280	533400	not the miracles trigger you or the rosary triggers you or the Virgin Mary triggers you or
533400	541400	Catholicism triggers you or whatever triggers you. Here's a woman that had a new lease on life. And
541400	550320	the story is intimately connected with a Catholic worker who came close to her in her moment of
550320	556720	need. The relationship that she has with her son, she talked about how, you know, when she was
556720	560720	diagnosed with cancer, she told her son and it just he was just, you know, floored by this. Of
560720	568360	course he was. And anyone will tell you, especially priests will tell you that the rosary is not
568360	575120	sort of a magic cure all to to beat cancer. There's a reason we call things miracles.
575120	581360	I'm waiting on a plumber. He said he'd be here at two o'clock. It's three o'clock and he's not
581360	600240	here. It's the way it goes sometimes with people, but when I think about this story, I think about
600240	607120	the providence of God and the work of God in the world and the work of God, even in YouTube and
607360	615360	between us and in all of these little comings and goings. I know I probably, a lot of you have
615360	620960	already clicked away because you were just looking for Jordan Peterson, John Lennox, dumb, dumb, dumb.
624560	631120	No, no, let's take our time because these are people and think about them as people and think
631200	639440	about what molds them and shapes them. And because as a pastor, I will tell you it is these journeys
639440	647360	in life that mold and shape people. And if you are a pastor or a priest, what you work with is the
647360	654960	care of the soul. And in many ways, it's deeply intertwined with the care of the story. And
655040	664160	this is what we work on. Now, I'll go desperately wanted me to watch a recent video by Apologetics
664160	671440	Roadshow in which the Apologetics Roadshow guy brought out this Peter Atkins, Unbelievable.
672720	676880	I think this is probably part of the big conversation series that Justin was doing a
676880	682800	number of years ago. And what this clip basically demonstrates is exactly the point that C.S. Lewis
682800	696480	makes in the beginning of his book, Miracles. I ball for evidence, heaven forbid. I find that
697680	704000	very difficult question. I'm just interested, what sort of evidence could science or the physical
704000	709280	universe present to you that would make you think actually that that is evidence that there's a
709280	719680	mind behind this? I find that a very difficult question. If I were looking in the Bible for
719680	731600	evidence, heaven forbid, I would expect to see maybe increase in entropy as equal to Q reversible
731600	737040	divided by temperature. And that is, if there was literally an equation in the Bible like that,
737040	746800	rather than all this wishy washy elastic writing that it pervades. This is so interesting because
746800	752480	wishy washy elastic writing, but then he goes on. Something like that, that they discovered in the
752480	759600	Bible. Well, exactly. The problem is, would it actually make you, I mean, is there anything from,
759600	763520	you know, is there any kind of evidence in the universe that could make, I mean, if the stars
763520	769680	lined up to spell, Peter, please believe in me, it's about time. I put it down to madness.
770800	776960	To personal madness. It sounds like, Peter, that there's no evidence that will persuade you away
776960	781600	from atheism. Well, to be honest, I think that's probably the case. In that sense, do you even
781600	789360	have an evidence based view if you're actually committed to atheism a priori? Well, I'm predicting
790160	795760	that there will be no such evidence. That's not quite the same thing as being committed to it,
795760	802160	a priori. I can't. But you said there's no evidence that would persuade you otherwise.
802160	810160	I think it's much more likely that I would have gone mad than such evidence would have been provided.
810160	820560	It's a brilliant clip. It's a brilliant clip. And again, CS Lewis makes this point at the beginning
820560	824560	of his book, Miracles, and he uses it with its completely other illustration. He says,
825200	828640	the only person that I ever know that the only person that I've known who has
829200	835360	claimed to have seen a ghost doesn't believe in ghosts. This is the way we work. You know,
835360	839200	all this talk of evidence, yadda, yadda, yadda, this stuff has been YouTube
839840	845840	boilerplate with atheism versus Christians forever. And the whole thing is hogwash.
846640	852640	People believe or they don't believe. And most of what goes into their belief or unbelief
853200	859920	is by no means the product of some rationalist calculation. And this is one of the big points
859920	868960	that John Vervakey makes. And he's dead on right. You know, reason has more to do with
868960	879360	relationship. This conversation that John, now I'm bringing every video into this video before
879360	883200	I even get to the video that I sort of said I was going to do, but that's okay.
884960	888400	I'm going to make a proposal for which I think there's an argument. It's based on
889200	893040	convergence of quite a few people's work, but perhaps most important to me right now is the
893040	898160	work of James Filler and his book on Neoplatonism, Heidegger, and the history of being, which is
898160	904000	relation as ontological ground. And his proposal is what the Neoplatonists had argued is that
904000	911680	contrary to an Aristotelian Cartesian framework, substance, individually, independently existing
911680	917280	things are not the ultimate ground of reality. Relation is. So it's not that relations emerge
917280	921520	from the things related, but the things related emerge from this field of relationality. You
921520	926640	can hear whitehead here, and you can also surprisingly hear physics, both that upper
926640	931440	end of relativity and the lower end of quantum. So this idea of relationality and what's really
931440	937680	important about that is it binds reality to information, which is inherently relational,
937680	941680	intelligibility that's inherently relational. And why am I going on about this? Well, think about
941680	946240	what you just said. You said the Christian idea and the Trinity, and this is Filler's argument,
946240	951760	too. The Trinity is, if properly understood, and I think the Eastern Orthodox Church fathers,
951760	955040	I know you might be Catholic or something. I don't mean to be insulting, but people like,
955040	960240	you know, Dionysus. There's a lot of sharing, a lot of these church fathers across the Protestant
960240	969360	Catholic Orthodox realm. Yes. And Maximus, one Western person, Erogena,
970320	978400	and also Nicholas of Cusa, who is Catholic, really make this very strong proposal that the
978400	988720	Trinity is actually a way of trying to exemplify that the ultimacy, that ultimacy is inherently
988720	997120	relational. And then if sacredness is about connectedness, about this dynamic reciprocally
997520	1003120	open, reciprocally opening relationality, we can see why sacredness seeks ultimacy.
1003920	1006800	Just explain to me how you're using the word ultimacy. I don't think I've got this.
1006800	1015200	Ultimacy means, okay, so your life depends on an everyday practical distinction between
1015200	1021040	appearance and reality, things that are illusory versus the things that are real. Okay. And it's
1021040	1026400	interesting that if you do a, like McGee and Barbara, if you do research into what is a necessary
1026400	1031120	feature of wisdom, it's the ability to see through illusion and into reality. That's one of the
1031120	1040000	defining features of the wise person. So notice something though, that we can only judge one
1040000	1044880	thing as illusory by comparing it to something that is real. There's a point made by Plato and
1044880	1049040	Marlo Ponti. So saying that everything's an illusion, actually it's like saying everything
1049040	1056160	is tall. It doesn't make any sense, right? Real is a comparative term. It's an
1056160	1065200	inherently comparative term. And then what we're doing is we're seeking what, what is that against
1065200	1071440	which all the comparisons are made. And all the work on, you know, when people experience what
1071440	1075920	they call the really real and mystical experience, it shows that people will, so what happens?
1075920	1080080	Yaden's work, when people, let's say they have a mystic and they encounter the really real,
1080080	1085040	they change their lives, their relationships, because they want to be in closer conformity.
1085040	1089520	So there's this, I want to be one with what is most real. That's what I'm meaning by
1089520	1097920	ultimate. And then what I'm saying is, go back to this picture that I was showing.
1099440	1105040	So if you want to get a sense of, let's say, Jordan Peterson's heart, now he said many,
1105040	1110400	many times that, well, you know, the details, the details of his personal convictions with
1110400	1118880	respect to the define or private classical modernist move. But the most, I think John
1118880	1131840	Vervecchi is right there. Relationality is what brings the facts, the building blocks, the things,
1131840	1142080	the stuff into right relation in our lives. Because again, this is sort of a basic thing
1142080	1146800	that we've been talking about in the corner for a very long time. You've heard commentatorial
1146800	1152480	explosiveness here in this room here in my messy office, there are, I could spend the rest of my
1152480	1159520	life just focusing on the things in this office and the relationality between this and that. But
1159520	1163440	relationality does is sort of stack things up in a value hierarchy. And then suddenly
1165120	1169680	it's the relation value hierarchies, of course, comparative relationality between this and that.
1171040	1179760	And so when Tammy Peterson is deathly ill with cancer, that no one survives. And Jordan has
1179760	1191120	acafesia from getting off these benzos and Michaela is running him to Russia. I saw, I probably won't
1191120	1197760	live long enough to read the definitive biography of these people, but it is going to be the most
1197760	1206560	insane book. It is going to be so good because their lives are quite, quite remarkable. And
1207360	1214400	everybody just sort of wants to have a little internet game. Is he or isn't he? What is he or
1214400	1222480	what isn't he? Or he's this or he's that? People, yes, you can talk about people that way. Those
1222480	1226880	are useful categories. We use them all the time. We have to because it's shorthand and because
1226880	1231760	lives are short yada yada yada. But when it comes to higher and higher resolution with respect to
1232400	1242560	people and our relations with them, deeper things matter. Now, the first thing to know about John
1242560	1248240	Lennox, if you've been around the internet apologetics community or at least around
1248240	1254480	unbelievable long enough, you know who this guy is. Now he kind of sits there and he kind of looks
1254480	1263280	like a grandpa. He's not wearing a fancy suit and his hair is kind of over the place and his
1263280	1274800	eyebrows are sticking up and you might think, do not think that for a minute. I call this guy
1275520	1285680	the Irish apologetics kung fu panda because he is sharp and he has his act together with respect
1285680	1290640	to these things. And this is the reason Justin Breyer Lee has had this guy opposite Peter Atkins.
1290640	1296480	Opposite, I don't know how many people again and again and again and again because he is no dummy.
1296480	1303680	He's been around the church. He's been around the faith. He's a mathematician. I mean, he is a very
1303680	1312880	sharp cookie and sort of this happy laid back older guy thing just lures you in and then he's
1312880	1322080	got you. That is John Lennox. That is who this man is. And so it's really cool that one way or another,
1322080	1330960	you know, he and Peterson are in a conversation together and now there are conversations that
1330960	1336640	Jordan has that go badly because Jordan steps on them. He gets excited about what he wants to say
1336640	1340800	and it's like, you might as well take the other person out of the room Jordan because you're
1340800	1346640	basically, you could do what I do and just line him up on a video and then just go off on your own.
1347200	1353280	But not this conversation. This conversation really goes well. And I said all of that sort of to
1353280	1359040	frame it because what does Jordan believe in his heart? Well, you can ask, you can go back and look
1359040	1365200	at Jordan, talk about faith, go back to that. What is it? Lawrence College? St. Lawrence College?
1365840	1368400	Well, maybe this is the plumber. No, it's not the plumber.
1374160	1377840	And when Jordan says, you know, what about religion? And he says, well, you know, this talk,
1377840	1384480	this chattering thing about what you think you believe, that's a far secondary importance
1384480	1390400	than how you act and what you act from. And that idea is true. And it should sober both
1390400	1397200	Christians and non-Christians alike because a great deal of what pastors major in in church is
1397200	1404160	getting Christians to actually sort of live out their belief. And it's very dangerous for atheists
1404160	1410640	because they sort of live out Christian belief from layers beneath them. This video is going to
1410640	1414960	come out after my eye and Hershey, I leave video and where I talk about some about that.
1415840	1420320	So what Jordan is doing here is comparing notes because
1422720	1427120	even though at this certain level, Jordan keeps getting asked about, does he believe in God? Yada,
1427120	1432560	yada, yada. There's a lot more going on about this. And Jordan's been thinking hard about this
1432560	1438400	stuff. And he's been testing people when he gets the chance. And now he's got someone in the room
1439040	1447600	that he clearly respects. And he wants to do some note comparing. And I can't think of a better guy
1447600	1453840	for him to talk to. Here we go. So I wanted to start by asking you your opinion on some
1454560	1459440	questions that have gone through my mind recently. And there's one that's very specific, I think
1459440	1466400	I'll start with, which is that, you know, I think for, for a lot of my life, and certainly when I
1466400	1474640	was younger, I really bought the doctrine that there was an unbridgeable gap between the scientific
1474640	1480080	way of looking at the world and the Christian way of looking at the world, let's say. And
1481840	1488960	that the split, the split, the apparent split between science and religion was a consequence
1488960	1496720	of an incommensurate dichotomy of worldviews, you know, and that the church had been opposed to
1496720	1503040	scientific progress, at least in part because the scientific viewpoint existed in contradiction to
1504400	1510320	Christian doctrine. We sold the fridge. I discovered someone had, this is the weird
1510320	1517040	stuff that happens at church, part of the introduction or the interruption. Someone
1517040	1523200	had stored a whole bunch of things of potato chips in the freezer, at least been in that
1523200	1529680	freezer for like before the pandemic. Well, you're still good. So it gives the pastor a little snack.
1529680	1537680	Anyway, back to it. Sure. But then, especially in recent years, in the last 10 years,
1538640	1546800	I've started to understand that that was something like a French Enlightenment slash
1546800	1555200	rationalist propaganda campaign, and that there's a different, that the relationship between
1556720	1563120	science and Christianity is much closer than I had imagined. I caught on to this a little bit by
1563120	1571120	reading Jung, but that just as the universities develop, I love the fact that he used the word
1571120	1579440	cotton down to it. And those, these subtle things are helpful because they help a broader range of
1579440	1588000	people listen to Peterson. Anyway, out of the monastic tradition, the notion that the natural
1588000	1596480	world was intelligible to the inquiring logos, that it had an intrinsic logic that studying it
1596480	1602880	would be beneficial to man, first of all, that it would be comprehensible and beneficial, and that
1602880	1610480	that was actually a kind of moral obligation. That all struck me as like axiomatic statements of
1610480	1616880	faith that were predicated on the Christian tradition that were the preconditions for the
1616880	1622080	emergence of science. And, you know, I've tried to take that idea apart over the last three or
1622080	1628240	four years to see if I can find any flaws in it. But I think the evidence that the universities
1628960	1634480	emerged out of the monastic tradition, instead of emerging contrary to that, that's absolutely
1634480	1641200	incontrovertible on every grounds you could possibly imagine. And the notion that you need to believe
1641280	1647360	in the intelligibility of the world, the capability of the human logos, and the,
1648160	1653120	and the beneficial consequence of acquiring knowledge, you have to believe in all that to
1653120	1657840	even get the scientific enterprise going. I also think that's incontrovertible and that those are
1657840	1664800	axioms of faith. And so I don't know how, I don't know if those views are in accordance with your
1664800	1669840	views or what you think about that. So I'd like to hear what you think about that. This is extremely
1669920	1678400	interesting to me because I never saw the tension between Christianity and science because very
1678400	1685040	early on as a teenager, I was introduced to the writings of a scientist who was a Christian
1685680	1693760	who drew my attention to something Alfred North Whitehead wrote. And it was really put in much
1693760	1700160	simpler language by C.S. Lewis when he wrote, men became scientific because they expected
1700160	1705600	law and nature, and they expected law and nature because they believed it a law giver.
1705600	1713040	And so very early on, and I was fascinated by the idea that actually modern science
1713840	1721040	is a legacy of the biblical worldview. And therefore it's no accident that the pioneers,
1721760	1729280	Galileo, Kepler, Newton, Maxwell, and so on were believers in God. And as you pointed out,
1730560	1736400	it underpins the tradition that lies behind the great universities of the world, that the doctrine
1736400	1745280	of creation was actually the belief, the underlying presupposition that allowed people to do science.
1745280	1752000	So I've come over my life to the conclusion that science and the biblical worldviews sit very
1752000	1757200	comfortably together, but it's science and atheism that do not sit comfortably together,
1757200	1761200	which I know is quite a controversial statement, but at least it gets discussion going.
1763040	1770880	Now, when I was in, I'm going to say the word again, all of you Scots out there,
1770880	1781440	Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Edinburgh, New College, having a festival, Alistair McGrath made similar
1781440	1792720	points. And again, we're facing what was sort of a, I mentioned in previous video, a lot of what
1792720	1799120	has sort of reverberated through the last century was the modernist fundamentalist fight.
1799120	1810640	And that fight was, it was certainly on the American scene. It was in Europe. And I think,
1810640	1821520	in many ways, it's that fight that sort of set up the imagination that these two things are at odds,
1821520	1827440	but I'll have to look for that McGrath video. We'll see if it's up yet. The university sometimes
1827520	1832000	can be really slow about putting their stuff up. They have last year's up. Yeah, see, they've got
1832000	1838400	NT Wright and they've got Rowan Williams, but they don't have this year's up yet. Anyway, when it
1838400	1843280	gets up, I'm going to keep looking for it because Alistair McGrath's talk, I thought was excellent,
1843280	1848560	and it touched on this. Completed a couple of documentaries with the Daily Wearer Plus crew,
1848560	1854560	and one of them was in Athens and two were in Jerusalem. And we were trying to puzzle out the
1855520	1863600	relationship between Greek thought and Judeo-Christian thought, most particularly the strange
1864240	1872320	happenstance that the Greek idea of an intrinsic logos in the world seemed to dovetail with the
1873040	1880080	Judeo-Christian idea of, you might say, of the word incarnate in the human psyche. And
1880880	1888000	it seemed to me and obviously to other observers that there was an affinity between the Greek
1888000	1895920	idea that the cosmos had an intrinsic comprehensibility and the idea that the proper orientation
1895920	1902400	for human beings ethically would be one of honest communication and investigation. And
1903040	1908960	those two things snapped on top of each other. It made me think of something that I actually
1908960	1915280	learned from Richard Dawkins, and I think this is a deep idea. Dawkins wrote a very influential
1915280	1925120	essay where he claimed that any organism that can function in an environment has to be a microcosm
1925120	1932560	of that environment. So for example, if you were an alien biologist and you were presented with a
1932560	1940320	terrestrial bird and you took the bird apart, you could infer from the bird's structure the
1940320	1946960	gravitational pull of the earth, the density of the atmosphere, the chemical composition of the
1946960	1954560	atmosphere, the electron. Remember what Viveki said about relationality? Now sort of here is
1954560	1958560	implicit that well sort of the environment comes first and then the bird comes second.
1959520	1964960	But of course the environment and the bird are of course, they're working at different speeds,
1964960	1974640	but they are also both changing. And so it's sort of the correlation between the two. And again,
1974640	1981440	the conceptualization of the two itself is also a product of a lot of this. But the correlation
1981440	1989920	of the two is in fact this relationality. The electromagnetic frequency that the sunlight
1989920	1996480	was, what would you say, at what electromagnetic frequencies the sun's light was most amenable
1996480	2005440	to vision, etc. You could derive a model of the environment from the physiology of the organism.
2005440	2012240	Now I know that there were medieval ideas that were deep in Christianity that the human soul
2012240	2017360	was a microcosm of the cosmos, that it reflected the structure of reality itself. And I've been
2017360	2024240	thinking about this in terms of how the world might be best conceptualized. So there's a mix
2024240	2031120	of ideas here. And if an organism has to be a microcosm of the cosmos in order to function,
2031840	2039280	and we are a microcosm in that regard, and we are a personality that runs on a narrative,
2039280	2046240	which we seem to be, then in what way is it reasonable to claim that the cosmos itself
2047040	2051760	is best conceptualized as something that could be entered into relationship with
2051760	2057200	personality to personality, and that that's not the most fundamental reflection of reality. I mean,
2057200	2064160	it seems to me that that's where Dawkins thought eventually points, if his proclamation that
2064880	2070560	an organism has to be a microcosm, an accurate microcosm in order to survive is accurate. So
2071600	2079120	now that. Long, long time ago, for those of you who have been watching this channel for years,
2079120	2089120	and there are a few thousand of you. Pascal, spirit of finesse, spirit of geometry,
2089120	2095120	should have been triggered by this. Years ago, when I was talking to John Varvakey about this,
2095120	2101920	when I, when I first came across, you know, it's interesting how much Pascal is in Lewis,
2101920	2108160	as I've been reading this biography of Lewis by Alistair McGrath. I should really do a much
2108160	2112240	deeper dive into Pascal himself, because Pascal seemed to figure a lot of the stuff out. And,
2112240	2120480	of course, Pascal was very early in, you know, early modern period. But this, basically, I hear,
2120480	2127520	I hear Peterson talking about, this is the spirit of finesse, that the way and this sort of connects
2127520	2137280	up with the mode that you have to enter into when dealing with persons is the appropriate mode for
2137280	2142400	religion. Now, the spirit of geometry is an appropriate mode. This also sort of maps on to
2142400	2148320	Ian McGilchrist's two hemispheres of the brain. But the spirit of finesse is the proper mode,
2148320	2154880	because now take this, this idea that he brought from Dawkins. The reason that
2156240	2160960	religion is shaped the way it is, and this is where Peter Atkins is told, well, there's, if
2160960	2166400	there's an equation in it, no, you don't understand. And every time Brett Weinstein starts talking about
2166400	2172720	this updating of wisdom, and that the old rules, and he's thinking about that religions are these,
2172720	2176640	these books of rules, and what religious people are, is they just keep following these little
2176640	2181440	rules. Now, again, rules are handy things, and rules are good things, and rules are fine. But you
2181440	2187840	cannot sort of reduce everything down to these little rules, because of this divide that Pascal
2187840	2192720	noted between sort of these two modes, the spirit of finesse and the spirit of geometry,
2192720	2197120	rule-based is sort of geometry, you can reduce geometry down into a bunch of rules.
2198560	2206400	But you can't pursue life that way. And I think John Revecky runs through well,
2206400	2211440	why sort of this rule-based approach doesn't work, because of commentatorial explosiveness,
2211440	2219440	because the number of rules that you would need, multiplies infinitely, because of the
2219440	2222400	commentatorial explosiveness of the world. Now, if you don't know what commentatorial
2222400	2226320	explosiveness is, you can go watch Awakening for the Meaning Crisis, it's this thing that I run
2226320	2232240	through. It's the basis of what led Jordan to a whole bunch of this, that via cognitive science,
2232240	2237680	what we do when we engage productively with the world is a massive compressive and reduction
2237680	2244480	effort to sort of break the world down into sizable parts that we can productively engage
2244480	2252880	with. In other words, we engage with the logos of the world productively, because things sort of
2252880	2260000	scale and they fractal down. I don't know if that made any sense to you, but it made sense to me.
2260560	2266880	Dovetails with the idea that the logos as a personality, so that would be the Judeo-Christian
2266880	2273920	concept, can investigate the logos of the universe and that those things dovetail. So now, I know
2273920	2280320	that's a conflict. And of course, the image of God is in there too. We are made in God's image,
2280320	2288480	and this personality, this personhood, this spirit of finesse, this mode of person, of relationality
2289600	2296640	is, in fact, the mode that we properly, we are like God in that way. We are children of God in
2296720	2301200	that way. Paul uses that phrase in the book of Acts. And...
2302400	2305920	...mismash of ideas, but I'm interested in your thoughts on that.
2305920	2307280	No, those are good ideas, Jordan.
2308080	2315920	Well, I think there's a lot in that actually. And I recall listening to you, you have a very
2315920	2322880	interesting lecture on Genesis 1. And when you came to this statement that human beings are made
2322880	2329760	in the image of God, you paused and you pointed out that this was the cornerstone of our civilization.
2329760	2336800	And I agree with that entirely. I think that what Dawkins is saying actually points to the exact
2336800	2342880	opposite direction to what his worldview is, which is atheism, of course. In other words,
2342880	2350880	that we can read off from creation something about the idea of a creator.
2350880	2360560	Now, we got to clean up this language. Atheism, of course. Okay, that's a shorthand for
2362560	2371200	that there is no governing, there is no governance of the, there is no personal governance of the
2371200	2378480	universe that we can relate to. So often, when we talk about God, this is what we're talking about.
2378480	2383440	And will Christians believe they can relate to the personal governance of the universe?
2383440	2390400	And Jordan Peterson basically made the argument that our person, our person ship, and I would,
2391760	2400080	I would push his argument even further that the evidence of the productivity of our person ship
2400080	2409200	in the universe and the capacity of the personal to colonize, and C.S. Lewis again goes through
2409200	2415360	this quite a bit in his book, Miracles, to colonize and manage and master the impersonal
2416320	2424400	is suggestive of the very fabric of the universe that the universe, in fact, is personal. Now,
2424400	2428560	one might argue, he's gonna flip this around and play devil's advocate that this is only
2428560	2438800	projection on our part. The difficulty with that argument is the universe seems receptive to person
2438800	2449360	hood. What C.S. Lewis does in Miracles is he uses reason and what's really helpful is to recognize
2450080	2455760	the ancient relationship between reason and this logos that Peterson is talking about. I
2455760	2462640	noticed this in Romans 12 on Sunday. You can see I have my Sunday school class up on the channel too,
2463280	2468080	but very famous passage. Therefore, I urge you brothers and sisters in view of God's mercy
2468080	2472320	to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God. And this is your
2473280	2477680	Lexham English Bible says reasonable service. And if he says true and proper service,
2478320	2485600	the RSV translation I grew up on was spiritual worship. And well, what is that? What is that?
2485680	2494160	What is that word beneath it? Well, it's this funny word that its root is in, its root is in logos.
2494160	2502160	And sometimes it's translated reasonable or rational and sometimes it's translated spiritual.
2502160	2508240	Well, what does that mean? What is the connection? Because if you would ask a modern, the logical
2508240	2514480	and the spiritual would seem out of source, but not if the spiritual is basically held together
2514480	2522240	and managed by the logos. It's the logos. It's, it's logos is the proper worship because you're
2522240	2531920	worshiping in line with the logos. So, so C.S. Lewis, there is then a God who is not a part of
2531920	2537280	nature, but nothing has yet been said to show that he must have created her. Might God and nature
2537280	2543040	both be self-existent and totally independent of each other? If you thought, and this is sort of
2543120	2548480	what you imagine, say, a sky daddy or super thing or something with something of that nature.
2549920	2554560	If you thought you would be a dualist and you would hold a view in which I consider manlier
2554560	2559440	and more reasonable than any form of naturalism, you might be many worse things than a dualist,
2559440	2564640	but I not fit, but I do not think dualism is true. There's an enormous difficulty conceiving two
2564640	2569760	things which simply coexist and have no other relation. If this difficulty sometimes escapes
2569760	2574720	our notice, that is because we are victims of picture thinking. We really imagine them side
2574720	2581360	by side in some kind of space, but of course, if they are both in a common space or a common time
2581360	2587520	or any kind of common medium whatsoever, they both would be part of a system and in fact of a nature.
2588720	2593280	Even if we succeed in eliminating such, such pictures, the mere fact of our think, of our
2593280	2598320	trying to think of them together slurs over the real difficulty because for that moment anyway,
2598320	2603920	our own mind is a common medium. If there can be such a thing as sheer otherness,
2603920	2611280	if things can coexist and no more, coexist and no more, it is at any rate conceptual in our mind
2611280	2617840	cannot form. And in the present instance, it seems especially gratuitous to try to form it,
2617840	2623040	for if we already know that God and nature have come into a certain relation, they have at the
2623040	2630560	very least a relation almost in one sense a common frontier in every human mind. The relation
2630560	2636240	which arises at that frontier are indeed the most complicated and intimate sort. That spearhead of
2636240	2643680	the supernatural capital S, which I call my reason links up to all my natural contents, my sensations,
2643680	2650080	emotions and the like. So completely that I call the mixture by a single word me. Again,
2650960	2656400	that is what I came called the unsymmetrical character of the frontier relations.
2657200	2661520	When the physical state of the brain dominates my thinking, it produces only disorder,
2661520	2667440	but my brain does not become any less a brain when it is dominated by reason capital R. Now again,
2668240	2673840	if you hear reason, you think, oh, Sam Harris, think of reason more as right relation.
2674240	2682160	And think of reason in terms of this Greek word, which is, has its roots sort of in this logos,
2682160	2686960	because that's sort of the thing that holds it together. It's this common medium.
2688960	2694080	The military metaphor of a spearhead is perhaps apparently ill-chosen. The supernatural reason
2694080	2701360	enters my natural being not like a weapon, more like a beam of light which illuminates
2702320	2708480	or a principle of organization which unifies and develops. Our whole picture of nature being
2708480	2716000	invaded, as if by a foreign enemy, was wrong. When we actually examine one of these invasions,
2716000	2722800	it looks much more like the arrival of a king among his own subjects, or a Mahut visiting
2722800	2728800	his own elephant. You have an elephant in a rider image. Look at that. The elephant may run amuck.
2728880	2733680	Nature may be rebellious, but from observing what happens when nature obeys,
2734960	2742640	it is almost impossible not to conclude that it is her very nature to be subject. All happens
2742640	2752640	as if she has been designed for that very role. And this, I think, is really what they are driving
2752640	2760320	at here. That, well, science seems to give us knowledge. Now, it can give us knowledge in
2760320	2765360	certain domains. Science struggles, in fact, to give us knowledge of itself, as John Verveke
2765360	2772480	points out numerous times. But the fact that it works as well as it does, even with us, suggests,
2772480	2781440	as C.S. Lewis says, that it is in fact a king, not science is the king, but personhood is the king,
2781440	2791040	and the immaterial world is, in fact, nature, or the material world is, in fact, nature.
2791040	2795760	And that's the kind of thing that we have, we experience in white technology,
2795760	2803280	is such a deep temptation for us because suddenly we are filled with our sensation of
2803280	2810000	our mastery over the world. And this, again, connects back up with the image of God.
2810720	2818320	And as you say, it dovetails perfectly. Let me put this another way. I'm a mathematician by
2818320	2823760	background and a linguist. I love language, and mathematics is a very sophisticated language,
2823760	2831040	but I love natural languages as well. And it seems to me that where this fits together best
2831840	2839920	is first in the fact that we can do science in the sense that there is a rational intelligibility
2840000	2846640	to the universe, which is the foundation of modern science and is a legacy of the biblical
2846640	2853440	worldview, so that the mathematical describability Einstein talked about,
2853440	2860080	he couldn't imagine any genuine scientists without faith in that. It's the axiom for doing
2860080	2865600	science is to believe the universe is intelligible. But if you ask for the rationale behind that,
2866160	2874880	again, not just intelligible, subjectable, that the universe in fact is subject to us,
2874880	2880720	and this, of course, is Genesis 1. Now, to the degree to which we are good stewards of this power,
2881520	2887520	the universe rebels against us because our subjection of it is not the kind of proper
2887520	2893760	subjection, but let's say the good master has to its dog who loves and cares for his dog.
2893760	2900160	Rafe and I talked about this in our conversation, but in fact, the exploiter who does not care
2900880	2908960	for the domain to which he has been given dominion, but in fact merely exploits and abuses.
2910080	2916400	We believe the universe is intelligible. It bears the imprint of a creator, and I see that at the
2916400	2923680	level of mathematics in its capacity to, at least in part, gives a handle on what's out there,
2923680	2929520	and also biology, where we have at the heart of every living cell the longest word we've ever
2929520	2936640	found, the genetic code. And all of that leads me to formulate it as follows, that we live in a
2936640	2944640	word-based universe, and that's the key of the Logos for me. Okay, and so what do you mean in that
2944640	2950640	case? So what do you mean specifically that we live in a word-based universe? What does that mean
2950640	2957600	for you on the broader conceptual landscape? Well, now that's a super important question,
2957600	2963120	because again, I believe in God. I don't believe in God. The book of James says, well, the devils
2963120	2969600	believe in God. They perhaps in some ways have clearer knowledge of God. If you think about
2969600	2973840	knowledge in terms of propositional knowledge, if you think about knowledge in terms of this
2973840	2980800	disembodied, abstract saber, if you use Spanish instead of cono sed, this kind of knowledge,
2980800	2991040	they certainly have that, but how about intimate knowledge? How about relational knowledge? Because
2992480	3000160	it's that's where all of this begins getting interesting. You can know that the girl across
3000160	3008880	the classroom is named Fulana, but to know her personally is a whole other thing.
3010160	3019200	Well, it means that this universe is not simply a product of natural unguided forces. It is a
3019200	3025200	product of a rational creator, an intelligent creator, and I believe even more than that,
3025200	3033200	a personal creator. Now, how I get there is only in part from a response to the universe as I find
3033200	3041440	it, the point you made about each organism being a microcosm of its environment. It's also, it seems
3041440	3048080	to me that there are two sources, two major sources of knowledge. There is, first of all,
3048080	3055760	observing the universe, science, etc. Then there are the humanities, but there's also the concept of
3055760	3063120	revelation in which I believe. In other words, it's not simply the human quest for the creator,
3063120	3069760	it's the creator revealing himself. So, for me, the anchor point in the end is that the
3069760	3077760	logos became human and we beheld his glory. In other words, we can see exactly what this means
3077840	3085760	in terms of what we can understand. That is the human being in which God encoded himself in Christ.
3085760	3090480	Those are big ideas, of course. They're very deep ideas. They need unpacking,
3090480	3097040	but that's essentially where I'm coming from. Okay, so now Lennox is going to bring out
3098000	3103680	argument made by Alvin Plantinga, made by C.S. Lewis, made before Lewis. I forget exactly who
3103680	3110960	Lewis cites for this argument, that in fact, if the universe is a product of randomness, would you
3110960	3121280	entrust yourself to this type of product? I'm jumping ahead a little bit, but this gets into
3121920	3125920	some of that and it gets into, again, the combinatorial explosiveness that you need.
3125920	3131280	Facts need prioritization. That's what values do. Again, Peterson's talked about this quite a bit
3131360	3139040	and he continues working through this. The scientific truth that's truest and beneficial
3139040	3145680	simultaneously is actually the conjunction in this Athens Jerusalem sense. It's actually the
3145680	3153120	conjunction of the intrinsic logic of the objective world making itself manifest to the
3153120	3158800	truthful penetrating psyche of the human observer. It's the interaction between those two that
3158800	3165280	constitute scientific truth and not one or the other. There's no getting, see, and what the
3165280	3171760	atheist materialists would like to do is to say, well, the world of facts speaks for itself,
3171760	3176080	but that's also technically untrue because there's an infinite number of facts.
3176080	3181280	They're certainly not all relevant. We can drown in the plethora of facts. That's the
3181280	3187120	combinatorial explosiveness point. We certainly will do that and to even communicate about them
3187120	3193120	or study them or even draw our attention to them. We have to prioritize and hierarchically arrange
3193120	3198480	the facts and we do that according to an ethic and I think that's actually, I think that is
3198480	3204720	incontrovertible on scientific grounds because we have seen the emergent realization in a whole
3204720	3211440	variety of domains, AI not least, that there are facts, but those facts have to be prioritized
3211440	3216880	and you prioritize facts with an ethic. That's absolutely right. There's a deeper problem
3216880	3223440	it seems to me with the atheist understanding of science and that is this. And again,
3226080	3233280	this yes or no God has become shorthand for a whole bunch of other consequential beliefs
3233280	3237200	and ideas. And so he says, atheist, okay, they're going to fight over this word again,
3237760	3242960	but his point is, well, what exactly is the nature of the universe? Is the universe intelligible?
3242960	3247440	And if the universe isn't intelligible, what are the implications of that intelligibility?
3248560	3255920	And what are the implications if in fact, our intelligibility is merely illusory?
3256720	3262800	That we do the science with our minds. Some people think the mind and the brain are the same. I
3262800	3269360	leave that aside since you're an expert on the mind and the brain. But I often say to people,
3270320	3275200	you know, what do you do science with? I've asked many leading scientists this,
3275200	3280960	they say, well, I do it with my mind and my brain. Give me a brief account of the brain.
3280960	3286160	And they say to me, well, the brain is the end product of a mindless, unguided process.
3286160	3292320	And I pause and I look up straight at the eye and I smile and I say, and you trust it. Tell me
3292320	3298480	honestly, if you knew that the computer you use or the machinery you use in the lab
3299040	3304560	was the end product of a mindless, unguided process, would you trust it? And the interesting thing,
3304560	3310240	I've done a lot of experiments with this little story and I've always got the answer, no, I would
3310240	3316400	not. So I say, you have a problem. In other words, your atheism is undermining the very
3316400	3322080	rationality you use not only to do science, but to construct any argument whatsoever. It's not
3322160	3327040	only shooting itself at the foot, it's worse than shooting itself at the brain. Let me,
3327920	3336240	and there's an example of John Lennox. Now this is a killer argument. And as again,
3336240	3340240	it's at this point that you just have to say, okay, he just landed a killer argument.
3341440	3348560	Do all the atheists just say, oh, okay, well, no, we don't change world views that way.
3349440	3355360	Just like, okay, Fulana comes over and introduces herself. Okay, well, it's going to take time,
3355360	3362240	it's going to take process, because all of this getting to know one another and know what the
3362240	3367280	world looks like from a different point of view, and know the implications of all of these ideas,
3367280	3374400	and even how in fact, these ideas that we are sort of crunching in this part of our mind,
3374400	3380720	which is conscious, is related to sort of the emergence of the ideas. Well,
3382640	3387760	we don't know. Now Peterson is about to go through this, and it's a very interesting thing because
3387760	3391680	he says, you know, these ideas appear to us. This is like revelation. Now that's,
3392480	3400960	that itself is a whole other interesting idea. And, and it's, I think it's a powerful point. I
3400960	3408560	don't know if, if I can go as far with it as Peterson would like to go with it, because,
3409920	3415840	and I don't think it's, I don't think it's wrong-headed, but it gets, it gets again to this
3415840	3424080	point that what is, what is it exactly that you want from Jordan? If Jordan would suddenly go
3424080	3432640	to a church, if Jordan would suddenly go to your church, well, you'd probably be excited and giddy
3432640	3437600	about that for a day or an hour, or maybe even a whole week or a month. But after that, it would
3437600	3442640	just kind of become normal things. And then in fact, if you had a little church fight in your
3442640	3450800	church over the color of the carpet, or others over some doctrinal, doctrinal position, etc, etc,
3451120	3453520	and Jordan was on the other side of it, you'd be annoyed with him.
3457120	3465200	These conversations are excellent because what they help us do is continue to process these,
3467120	3473760	that they help us do the work of engaging with a world
3474560	3486240	that is filled with the logos of God. And the process isn't just about sort of getting our
3486240	3492720	thoughts straight, we have to do that. I had a person come up to me just last Sunday, and somehow
3493280	3499920	I quote Lewis a lot in my sermons, and, and she came up to me and she's a dear, lovely, wonderful
3500560	3509200	woman. And she said, you know, I got this book, Mere Christianity, and I started reading it,
3509200	3517840	and it's hard, I don't understand it. And some of you might say, mere Christianity,
3517840	3524240	that's the easy one, read miracles, or even read his scholarly stuff, you know,
3524800	3532240	preface to Paradise Lost, or his Oxford English Literature book, or, you know,
3532960	3536720	yeah, Lewis can get a lot harder than Mere Christianity. Mere Christianity was pitched
3536720	3546800	to a radio audience in England during the war. But for many people, that's just not the wavelength
3546800	3552400	that they're at, and all the think-y-talk-y stuff. For some of us, that's, you know, that's where things
3552400	3560000	are, and that's absolutely fine. But for many people, they aren't. And it's amazing how much sense
3560000	3567920	people can make through sort of this personal relationship mode. And I think, in fact, it's
3567920	3575440	a deeply powerful mode, and it's the mode that, in fact, in many cases trumps the other mode.
3576080	3582400	People don't care how much you think until they, until they, people don't care how much you know,
3582400	3587680	until they know how much you care. There's only these little pastor turnaround things that are
3587680	3594000	semi-easy to remember. You can see I didn't remember it right the first time. But anyway,
3594000	3599280	I don't, I don't know how much more I'll do with this video, as with all the daily wire things,
3599280	3603520	there's another half hour. I haven't actually listened to the last half hour. I very much want
3604080	3609840	to, because I very much enjoyed this conversation. And this has been the conversation that Christians
3609840	3616320	have been waiting for. But I don't think, in the end, a lot of people who are sort of playing the
3616320	3621520	tribal game are going to get out of the conversation what it is they're looking for. Well, maybe some
3621600	3628080	will, and that's great. But, you know, even, even with all the drama around Diane, Hersey, Ali,
3631120	3636960	there's a, there's a, it's sort of like Tom Brady winning the Super Bowl. I won the Super Bowl.
3637760	3644000	I won it again. I won it again. I won it again. And he doesn't quite know when to retire.
3644880	3651440	But winning the Super Bowl isn't what it was. Now, you can apply some of Peterson's
3653200	3658080	ideas about meaning, how meaning is always in the reaching, not in the grabbing.
3659520	3667120	And I think there's a lot of truth to that. And I think, again, the truth is that in this world,
3668080	3673920	we are always reaching, and the receiving comes in Christian terms, and this is what
3673920	3678320	Christians actually call it, the consummation. And you might say, consummation, that's a funny
3678320	3687360	word. Well, it's the same word that happens after the consummation of the marriage. It's a deep form
3687520	3697120	of knowing. It's not just knowing that. It's consummation. So maybe that's enough for this.
3697120	3704080	I'll keep an eye on the comments and we'll see, because there's a lot of videos I want to treat.
3704080	3707600	There's a lot of stuff out there, but this, this was a good one. I absolutely recommend
3707600	3716800	watching it, but it's not, I don't even know what people are looking for with respect to the whole
3717600	3727120	Jordan Peterson Christian or no thing. It certainly is building a lot of popularity on
3727120	3734320	YouTube channels, but I don't think that game is what we think it is. Anyway, leave a comment.
3734320	3735040	Let me know what you think.
