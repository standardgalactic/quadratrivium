00:00.000 --> 00:06.880
Hi, this is Paul. A lot of people have been asking for me to do some work on this conversation

00:06.880 --> 00:11.720
between John Lennox and Jordan Peterson. It's a good conversation. It's a conversation

00:11.720 --> 00:16.520
that I think a lot of Christians have been waiting for. But before I talk about it, I

00:16.520 --> 00:25.120
want to contextualize it a little bit because YouTube sort of has this culture where it's

00:25.760 --> 00:32.600
tribal match of red rover where you're just, you know, let's have Jordan come over and

00:32.600 --> 00:37.480
Jordan will come over into the, first the battle will be into the Christian camp and

00:37.480 --> 00:40.720
then the battle will be between the Orthodox and the Catholics and the Protestants and

00:40.720 --> 00:45.960
how many versions of Protestants and alignment with Pope Francis or against Pope Francis

00:45.960 --> 00:50.800
or, I don't even know the intramurals the Orthodox have, but I certainly imagine they

00:50.880 --> 00:58.160
do have their own intramurals. So I want to contextualize this a little bit because today

00:58.160 --> 01:03.720
I released the video where I talked about Jordan Peterson and Bill Maher. And part of

01:03.720 --> 01:10.120
me, before I release a video like that, part of me knows that's going to bang, hit, you

01:10.120 --> 01:15.000
know, number one of the last 10 videos. YouTube analytics kind of shows you that thing. And

01:15.000 --> 01:19.640
a lot of people will watch that and the comment section will sort of get flooded with four

01:19.680 --> 01:24.200
against Jordan Peterson stuff and yada, yada. And this, this kind of thing, I just sort

01:24.200 --> 01:31.200
of endure. Part of me would far rather put out a video that mostly people from the corner

01:31.200 --> 01:40.200
watch and the usual suspects sort of put comments below and we can sort of continue to process

01:40.200 --> 01:47.480
these conversations, this drama, these journeys as we go along instead of sort of having the

01:47.520 --> 01:52.440
internet of hot takes and the internet of beefs sort of take over the comment section

01:52.440 --> 02:03.440
and cloud the conversation. Part of me would love to see people just sort of sit back, sit

02:03.440 --> 02:09.560
back and, and think a little bit more thoroughly about what exactly we're looking for from

02:09.560 --> 02:16.560
Jordan with respect to this religious question. Because if you, if you think about it more

02:17.080 --> 02:23.080
than your tribal instinct sort of jumps onto you for more than a minute, especially if

02:23.080 --> 02:29.280
you, let's say, don't have a personal relationship with Jordan Peterson, meaning you don't have

02:29.280 --> 02:33.080
a kind of friendship where you have his cell phone number and you can text him and he'll

02:33.080 --> 02:39.040
text right back, or you can call and then go out to coffee and such and such. And the

02:39.080 --> 02:46.080
vast majority of us do not, myself included, what, what really is our participation in

02:47.240 --> 02:52.560
this game? And to me, it's sort of connected to this much broader cultural game that we

02:52.560 --> 02:59.160
play of participation with the heavenly host of people we see on the screens and what they

02:59.160 --> 03:06.160
believe and what they don't believe. And I, I, I touched that a little bit when on Twitter

03:06.440 --> 03:12.520
the other day, I just caught that Heather Hying and Brett Weinstein were doing a live

03:12.520 --> 03:17.440
stream and that, and so I just, I wonder what they're talking about. So I just click over

03:17.440 --> 03:21.280
there for a minute or two, try to get a sense of what they're talking about. And then Brett

03:21.280 --> 03:25.600
sort of looks across the table at Heather with a, with really a lovely look. And when

03:25.600 --> 03:31.760
I saw them at ARC, I said to them, you know, complete, completely apart from all of the

03:31.760 --> 03:36.080
kinds of things that I could sit down and have 10 hours of conversation with Brett about

03:36.120 --> 03:42.240
with respect to religion, which would probably go absolutely nowhere. I just wanted to say

03:42.240 --> 03:45.480
to them, you know, one of the things I really love about your channels is the way that you

03:45.480 --> 03:50.120
two interact with each other. And Brett was just looking adoringly at his wife. And I

03:50.120 --> 03:57.120
thought that alone is an enormous thing on the internet, just to have a happily married

03:57.560 --> 04:03.960
couple who are thinkers and talkers, regardless of whether you think they're right and wrong

04:04.000 --> 04:10.600
on, on how many different issues they're doing something good in the world, just by, just

04:10.600 --> 04:17.480
by being married well on camera before the internet. Now, is that everything I could

04:17.480 --> 04:22.160
always hopefully ask for? No, of course not. Do I have other ideas about religion and other

04:22.160 --> 04:25.840
desires about what people would have in their life with respect to their belief and their

04:25.840 --> 04:33.440
religion? No, of course I do. But a little bit of, a little bit of understanding about

04:34.000 --> 04:39.640
how small we are today, I did a Randall's conversation with someone that I, that came to

04:39.640 --> 04:44.760
the Washington conference and probably a good number of the Randall's conversations will

04:44.760 --> 04:49.080
be behind the $3 membership thing, not because I'm trying to keep it from people, but just

04:49.080 --> 04:53.080
because many of the people that have conversations with, they want to tell their story and they

04:53.080 --> 04:57.560
don't really want their story on the whole open internet. And so, you know, if you're

04:57.560 --> 05:02.080
really interested in it, $3 a month, you can unsubscribe at any time. If you want to go

05:02.080 --> 05:05.480
and look and watch the Randall's conversations, there they are. Will there be other Randall's

05:05.480 --> 05:10.920
conversations not behind the paywall? Absolutely. But that's probably where they're going to be

05:10.920 --> 05:15.360
because many people have the sense to maybe not just share everything in their story out

05:15.360 --> 05:21.400
on the internet all the time for anyone to see just passing by. Not that $3 is a huge

05:21.440 --> 05:29.560
barrier to find out, but the truth is, it's just going to keep things there. Anyway, so

05:29.560 --> 05:33.440
I asked one of the questions I usually ask people, which was, well, how did you find

05:33.440 --> 05:39.880
my channel? And he told me the story and I, he had been unemployed for a little period

05:39.880 --> 05:43.840
of time and he was watching a lot of critical drinker and he'd kind of been through all

05:43.840 --> 05:49.400
the critical drinker videos. And then I popped up and first there was this horror that, oh,

05:49.400 --> 05:53.280
either this is going to be an angry old man shouting at the sky or it's going to be some

05:53.280 --> 05:58.920
evangelical pastor who's trying to use pop culture to wheedle his way in to get that

05:58.920 --> 06:05.080
message across. And what he discovered was, of course, something a little bit different.

06:05.080 --> 06:09.080
And then he watched a video after video and even cared enough to come to a conference in

06:09.080 --> 06:13.240
Washington, DC. And then at the conference say, I'd really love to do a Randall's conversation

06:13.280 --> 06:23.400
with you. So we set that up and we did it today. All that to say is people have lives and the

06:23.400 --> 06:31.320
development of their faith or non faith is a very subtle extensive process, only part of

06:31.320 --> 06:36.200
which, and this is what I talked with Rafe Kelly a little bit about, only part of which is actually

06:36.200 --> 06:42.720
sort of accessible to us in real time in terms of our awareness and our consciousness. So much of

06:42.720 --> 06:50.480
this is happening at levels in our, even within our own cognition, but also in the cognition that

06:50.480 --> 06:57.360
happens between us in the world at levels we don't simply understand. And in my opinion, the best

06:57.360 --> 07:04.200
language we have for describing that is language about the work of the Holy Spirit, language about

07:05.040 --> 07:09.960
the spirits and principalities and powers. That's why I use that language because it's that level

07:09.960 --> 07:19.680
that all of these transactions are underway. And that is as true for Jordan Peterson as it is for

07:19.800 --> 07:26.720
any of us. If you're really curious about Jordan's faith development, the video I would actually

07:26.720 --> 07:33.480
recommend is one that just popped up on my feed, Tammy Peterson Rosary testimony. It's a beautiful

07:33.480 --> 07:45.120
little film about Tammy's cancer and her healing. And you gain a lot of insight into what is probably

07:45.120 --> 07:52.880
the most formative relationship of Jordan Peterson's life. And the miracle that rescued Tammy from

07:53.080 --> 08:04.520
cancer, and I'll call it a miracle, is something that impacts her family deeply. And as the news came

08:04.520 --> 08:11.960
out recently, she has begun the process to become an adult convert to Catholicism. And I pray that

08:12.160 --> 08:19.280
this process is a beautiful one. And, you know, there could be a bunch of Protestants, there's stuff

08:19.280 --> 08:24.840
in this video that are going to trigger some Protestants and fair enough. But as I said to the

08:24.840 --> 08:29.880
rando and the randos conversations, they said, what piece of advice were you given that sort of

08:29.880 --> 08:35.520
sticks with you? And I had to stop and really think and who gave it to you. And the one the one

08:35.520 --> 08:41.600
thing that I said to him was one thing that I learned from my father is pick your battles. And

08:41.600 --> 08:47.280
what picking your battles is all about is keep the first things the first things. And whether or

08:47.280 --> 08:53.400
not the miracles trigger you or the rosary triggers you or the Virgin Mary triggers you or

08:53.400 --> 09:01.400
Catholicism triggers you or whatever triggers you. Here's a woman that had a new lease on life. And

09:01.400 --> 09:10.320
the story is intimately connected with a Catholic worker who came close to her in her moment of

09:10.320 --> 09:16.720
need. The relationship that she has with her son, she talked about how, you know, when she was

09:16.720 --> 09:20.720
diagnosed with cancer, she told her son and it just he was just, you know, floored by this. Of

09:20.720 --> 09:28.360
course he was. And anyone will tell you, especially priests will tell you that the rosary is not

09:28.360 --> 09:35.120
sort of a magic cure all to to beat cancer. There's a reason we call things miracles.

09:35.120 --> 09:41.360
I'm waiting on a plumber. He said he'd be here at two o'clock. It's three o'clock and he's not

09:41.360 --> 10:00.240
here. It's the way it goes sometimes with people, but when I think about this story, I think about

10:00.240 --> 10:07.120
the providence of God and the work of God in the world and the work of God, even in YouTube and

10:07.360 --> 10:15.360
between us and in all of these little comings and goings. I know I probably, a lot of you have

10:15.360 --> 10:20.960
already clicked away because you were just looking for Jordan Peterson, John Lennox, dumb, dumb, dumb.

10:24.560 --> 10:31.120
No, no, let's take our time because these are people and think about them as people and think

10:31.200 --> 10:39.440
about what molds them and shapes them. And because as a pastor, I will tell you it is these journeys

10:39.440 --> 10:47.360
in life that mold and shape people. And if you are a pastor or a priest, what you work with is the

10:47.360 --> 10:54.960
care of the soul. And in many ways, it's deeply intertwined with the care of the story. And

10:55.040 --> 11:04.160
this is what we work on. Now, I'll go desperately wanted me to watch a recent video by Apologetics

11:04.160 --> 11:11.440
Roadshow in which the Apologetics Roadshow guy brought out this Peter Atkins, Unbelievable.

11:12.720 --> 11:16.880
I think this is probably part of the big conversation series that Justin was doing a

11:16.880 --> 11:22.800
number of years ago. And what this clip basically demonstrates is exactly the point that C.S. Lewis

11:22.800 --> 11:36.480
makes in the beginning of his book, Miracles. I ball for evidence, heaven forbid. I find that

11:37.680 --> 11:44.000
very difficult question. I'm just interested, what sort of evidence could science or the physical

11:44.000 --> 11:49.280
universe present to you that would make you think actually that that is evidence that there's a

11:49.280 --> 11:59.680
mind behind this? I find that a very difficult question. If I were looking in the Bible for

11:59.680 --> 12:11.600
evidence, heaven forbid, I would expect to see maybe increase in entropy as equal to Q reversible

12:11.600 --> 12:17.040
divided by temperature. And that is, if there was literally an equation in the Bible like that,

12:17.040 --> 12:26.800
rather than all this wishy washy elastic writing that it pervades. This is so interesting because

12:26.800 --> 12:32.480
wishy washy elastic writing, but then he goes on. Something like that, that they discovered in the

12:32.480 --> 12:39.600
Bible. Well, exactly. The problem is, would it actually make you, I mean, is there anything from,

12:39.600 --> 12:43.520
you know, is there any kind of evidence in the universe that could make, I mean, if the stars

12:43.520 --> 12:49.680
lined up to spell, Peter, please believe in me, it's about time. I put it down to madness.

12:50.800 --> 12:56.960
To personal madness. It sounds like, Peter, that there's no evidence that will persuade you away

12:56.960 --> 13:01.600
from atheism. Well, to be honest, I think that's probably the case. In that sense, do you even

13:01.600 --> 13:09.360
have an evidence based view if you're actually committed to atheism a priori? Well, I'm predicting

13:10.160 --> 13:15.760
that there will be no such evidence. That's not quite the same thing as being committed to it,

13:15.760 --> 13:22.160
a priori. I can't. But you said there's no evidence that would persuade you otherwise.

13:22.160 --> 13:30.160
I think it's much more likely that I would have gone mad than such evidence would have been provided.

13:30.160 --> 13:40.560
It's a brilliant clip. It's a brilliant clip. And again, CS Lewis makes this point at the beginning

13:40.560 --> 13:44.560
of his book, Miracles, and he uses it with its completely other illustration. He says,

13:45.200 --> 13:48.640
the only person that I ever know that the only person that I've known who has

13:49.200 --> 13:55.360
claimed to have seen a ghost doesn't believe in ghosts. This is the way we work. You know,

13:55.360 --> 13:59.200
all this talk of evidence, yadda, yadda, yadda, this stuff has been YouTube

13:59.840 --> 14:05.840
boilerplate with atheism versus Christians forever. And the whole thing is hogwash.

14:06.640 --> 14:12.640
People believe or they don't believe. And most of what goes into their belief or unbelief

14:13.200 --> 14:19.920
is by no means the product of some rationalist calculation. And this is one of the big points

14:19.920 --> 14:28.960
that John Vervakey makes. And he's dead on right. You know, reason has more to do with

14:28.960 --> 14:39.360
relationship. This conversation that John, now I'm bringing every video into this video before

14:39.360 --> 14:43.200
I even get to the video that I sort of said I was going to do, but that's okay.

14:44.960 --> 14:48.400
I'm going to make a proposal for which I think there's an argument. It's based on

14:49.200 --> 14:53.040
convergence of quite a few people's work, but perhaps most important to me right now is the

14:53.040 --> 14:58.160
work of James Filler and his book on Neoplatonism, Heidegger, and the history of being, which is

14:58.160 --> 15:04.000
relation as ontological ground. And his proposal is what the Neoplatonists had argued is that

15:04.000 --> 15:11.680
contrary to an Aristotelian Cartesian framework, substance, individually, independently existing

15:11.680 --> 15:17.280
things are not the ultimate ground of reality. Relation is. So it's not that relations emerge

15:17.280 --> 15:21.520
from the things related, but the things related emerge from this field of relationality. You

15:21.520 --> 15:26.640
can hear whitehead here, and you can also surprisingly hear physics, both that upper

15:26.640 --> 15:31.440
end of relativity and the lower end of quantum. So this idea of relationality and what's really

15:31.440 --> 15:37.680
important about that is it binds reality to information, which is inherently relational,

15:37.680 --> 15:41.680
intelligibility that's inherently relational. And why am I going on about this? Well, think about

15:41.680 --> 15:46.240
what you just said. You said the Christian idea and the Trinity, and this is Filler's argument,

15:46.240 --> 15:51.760
too. The Trinity is, if properly understood, and I think the Eastern Orthodox Church fathers,

15:51.760 --> 15:55.040
I know you might be Catholic or something. I don't mean to be insulting, but people like,

15:55.040 --> 16:00.240
you know, Dionysus. There's a lot of sharing, a lot of these church fathers across the Protestant

16:00.240 --> 16:09.360
Catholic Orthodox realm. Yes. And Maximus, one Western person, Erogena,

16:10.320 --> 16:18.400
and also Nicholas of Cusa, who is Catholic, really make this very strong proposal that the

16:18.400 --> 16:28.720
Trinity is actually a way of trying to exemplify that the ultimacy, that ultimacy is inherently

16:28.720 --> 16:37.120
relational. And then if sacredness is about connectedness, about this dynamic reciprocally

16:37.520 --> 16:43.120
open, reciprocally opening relationality, we can see why sacredness seeks ultimacy.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.800
Just explain to me how you're using the word ultimacy. I don't think I've got this.

16:46.800 --> 16:55.200
Ultimacy means, okay, so your life depends on an everyday practical distinction between

16:55.200 --> 17:01.040
appearance and reality, things that are illusory versus the things that are real. Okay. And it's

17:01.040 --> 17:06.400
interesting that if you do a, like McGee and Barbara, if you do research into what is a necessary

17:06.400 --> 17:11.120
feature of wisdom, it's the ability to see through illusion and into reality. That's one of the

17:11.120 --> 17:20.000
defining features of the wise person. So notice something though, that we can only judge one

17:20.000 --> 17:24.880
thing as illusory by comparing it to something that is real. There's a point made by Plato and

17:24.880 --> 17:29.040
Marlo Ponti. So saying that everything's an illusion, actually it's like saying everything

17:29.040 --> 17:36.160
is tall. It doesn't make any sense, right? Real is a comparative term. It's an

17:36.160 --> 17:45.200
inherently comparative term. And then what we're doing is we're seeking what, what is that against

17:45.200 --> 17:51.440
which all the comparisons are made. And all the work on, you know, when people experience what

17:51.440 --> 17:55.920
they call the really real and mystical experience, it shows that people will, so what happens?

17:55.920 --> 18:00.080
Yaden's work, when people, let's say they have a mystic and they encounter the really real,

18:00.080 --> 18:05.040
they change their lives, their relationships, because they want to be in closer conformity.

18:05.040 --> 18:09.520
So there's this, I want to be one with what is most real. That's what I'm meaning by

18:09.520 --> 18:17.920
ultimate. And then what I'm saying is, go back to this picture that I was showing.

18:19.440 --> 18:25.040
So if you want to get a sense of, let's say, Jordan Peterson's heart, now he said many,

18:25.040 --> 18:30.400
many times that, well, you know, the details, the details of his personal convictions with

18:30.400 --> 18:38.880
respect to the define or private classical modernist move. But the most, I think John

18:38.880 --> 18:51.840
Vervecchi is right there. Relationality is what brings the facts, the building blocks, the things,

18:51.840 --> 19:02.080
the stuff into right relation in our lives. Because again, this is sort of a basic thing

19:02.080 --> 19:06.800
that we've been talking about in the corner for a very long time. You've heard commentatorial

19:06.800 --> 19:12.480
explosiveness here in this room here in my messy office, there are, I could spend the rest of my

19:12.480 --> 19:19.520
life just focusing on the things in this office and the relationality between this and that. But

19:19.520 --> 19:23.440
relationality does is sort of stack things up in a value hierarchy. And then suddenly

19:25.120 --> 19:29.680
it's the relation value hierarchies, of course, comparative relationality between this and that.

19:31.040 --> 19:39.760
And so when Tammy Peterson is deathly ill with cancer, that no one survives. And Jordan has

19:39.760 --> 19:51.120
acafesia from getting off these benzos and Michaela is running him to Russia. I saw, I probably won't

19:51.120 --> 19:57.760
live long enough to read the definitive biography of these people, but it is going to be the most

19:57.760 --> 20:06.560
insane book. It is going to be so good because their lives are quite, quite remarkable. And

20:07.360 --> 20:14.400
everybody just sort of wants to have a little internet game. Is he or isn't he? What is he or

20:14.400 --> 20:22.480
what isn't he? Or he's this or he's that? People, yes, you can talk about people that way. Those

20:22.480 --> 20:26.880
are useful categories. We use them all the time. We have to because it's shorthand and because

20:26.880 --> 20:31.760
lives are short yada yada yada. But when it comes to higher and higher resolution with respect to

20:32.400 --> 20:42.560
people and our relations with them, deeper things matter. Now, the first thing to know about John

20:42.560 --> 20:48.240
Lennox, if you've been around the internet apologetics community or at least around

20:48.240 --> 20:54.480
unbelievable long enough, you know who this guy is. Now he kind of sits there and he kind of looks

20:54.480 --> 21:03.280
like a grandpa. He's not wearing a fancy suit and his hair is kind of over the place and his

21:03.280 --> 21:14.800
eyebrows are sticking up and you might think, do not think that for a minute. I call this guy

21:15.520 --> 21:25.680
the Irish apologetics kung fu panda because he is sharp and he has his act together with respect

21:25.680 --> 21:30.640
to these things. And this is the reason Justin Breyer Lee has had this guy opposite Peter Atkins.

21:30.640 --> 21:36.480
Opposite, I don't know how many people again and again and again and again because he is no dummy.

21:36.480 --> 21:43.680
He's been around the church. He's been around the faith. He's a mathematician. I mean, he is a very

21:43.680 --> 21:52.880
sharp cookie and sort of this happy laid back older guy thing just lures you in and then he's

21:52.880 --> 22:02.080
got you. That is John Lennox. That is who this man is. And so it's really cool that one way or another,

22:02.080 --> 22:10.960
you know, he and Peterson are in a conversation together and now there are conversations that

22:10.960 --> 22:16.640
Jordan has that go badly because Jordan steps on them. He gets excited about what he wants to say

22:16.640 --> 22:20.800
and it's like, you might as well take the other person out of the room Jordan because you're

22:20.800 --> 22:26.640
basically, you could do what I do and just line him up on a video and then just go off on your own.

22:27.200 --> 22:33.280
But not this conversation. This conversation really goes well. And I said all of that sort of to

22:33.280 --> 22:39.040
frame it because what does Jordan believe in his heart? Well, you can ask, you can go back and look

22:39.040 --> 22:45.200
at Jordan, talk about faith, go back to that. What is it? Lawrence College? St. Lawrence College?

22:45.840 --> 22:48.400
Well, maybe this is the plumber. No, it's not the plumber.

22:54.160 --> 22:57.840
And when Jordan says, you know, what about religion? And he says, well, you know, this talk,

22:57.840 --> 23:04.480
this chattering thing about what you think you believe, that's a far secondary importance

23:04.480 --> 23:10.400
than how you act and what you act from. And that idea is true. And it should sober both

23:10.400 --> 23:17.200
Christians and non-Christians alike because a great deal of what pastors major in in church is

23:17.200 --> 23:24.160
getting Christians to actually sort of live out their belief. And it's very dangerous for atheists

23:24.160 --> 23:30.640
because they sort of live out Christian belief from layers beneath them. This video is going to

23:30.640 --> 23:34.960
come out after my eye and Hershey, I leave video and where I talk about some about that.

23:35.840 --> 23:40.320
So what Jordan is doing here is comparing notes because

23:42.720 --> 23:47.120
even though at this certain level, Jordan keeps getting asked about, does he believe in God? Yada,

23:47.120 --> 23:52.560
yada, yada. There's a lot more going on about this. And Jordan's been thinking hard about this

23:52.560 --> 23:58.400
stuff. And he's been testing people when he gets the chance. And now he's got someone in the room

23:59.040 --> 24:07.600
that he clearly respects. And he wants to do some note comparing. And I can't think of a better guy

24:07.600 --> 24:13.840
for him to talk to. Here we go. So I wanted to start by asking you your opinion on some

24:14.560 --> 24:19.440
questions that have gone through my mind recently. And there's one that's very specific, I think

24:19.440 --> 24:26.400
I'll start with, which is that, you know, I think for, for a lot of my life, and certainly when I

24:26.400 --> 24:34.640
was younger, I really bought the doctrine that there was an unbridgeable gap between the scientific

24:34.640 --> 24:40.080
way of looking at the world and the Christian way of looking at the world, let's say. And

24:41.840 --> 24:48.960
that the split, the split, the apparent split between science and religion was a consequence

24:48.960 --> 24:56.720
of an incommensurate dichotomy of worldviews, you know, and that the church had been opposed to

24:56.720 --> 25:03.040
scientific progress, at least in part because the scientific viewpoint existed in contradiction to

25:04.400 --> 25:10.320
Christian doctrine. We sold the fridge. I discovered someone had, this is the weird

25:10.320 --> 25:17.040
stuff that happens at church, part of the introduction or the interruption. Someone

25:17.040 --> 25:23.200
had stored a whole bunch of things of potato chips in the freezer, at least been in that

25:23.200 --> 25:29.680
freezer for like before the pandemic. Well, you're still good. So it gives the pastor a little snack.

25:29.680 --> 25:37.680
Anyway, back to it. Sure. But then, especially in recent years, in the last 10 years,

25:38.640 --> 25:46.800
I've started to understand that that was something like a French Enlightenment slash

25:46.800 --> 25:55.200
rationalist propaganda campaign, and that there's a different, that the relationship between

25:56.720 --> 26:03.120
science and Christianity is much closer than I had imagined. I caught on to this a little bit by

26:03.120 --> 26:11.120
reading Jung, but that just as the universities develop, I love the fact that he used the word

26:11.120 --> 26:19.440
cotton down to it. And those, these subtle things are helpful because they help a broader range of

26:19.440 --> 26:28.000
people listen to Peterson. Anyway, out of the monastic tradition, the notion that the natural

26:28.000 --> 26:36.480
world was intelligible to the inquiring logos, that it had an intrinsic logic that studying it

26:36.480 --> 26:42.880
would be beneficial to man, first of all, that it would be comprehensible and beneficial, and that

26:42.880 --> 26:50.480
that was actually a kind of moral obligation. That all struck me as like axiomatic statements of

26:50.480 --> 26:56.880
faith that were predicated on the Christian tradition that were the preconditions for the

26:56.880 --> 27:02.080
emergence of science. And, you know, I've tried to take that idea apart over the last three or

27:02.080 --> 27:08.240
four years to see if I can find any flaws in it. But I think the evidence that the universities

27:08.960 --> 27:14.480
emerged out of the monastic tradition, instead of emerging contrary to that, that's absolutely

27:14.480 --> 27:21.200
incontrovertible on every grounds you could possibly imagine. And the notion that you need to believe

27:21.280 --> 27:27.360
in the intelligibility of the world, the capability of the human logos, and the,

27:28.160 --> 27:33.120
and the beneficial consequence of acquiring knowledge, you have to believe in all that to

27:33.120 --> 27:37.840
even get the scientific enterprise going. I also think that's incontrovertible and that those are

27:37.840 --> 27:44.800
axioms of faith. And so I don't know how, I don't know if those views are in accordance with your

27:44.800 --> 27:49.840
views or what you think about that. So I'd like to hear what you think about that. This is extremely

27:49.920 --> 27:58.400
interesting to me because I never saw the tension between Christianity and science because very

27:58.400 --> 28:05.040
early on as a teenager, I was introduced to the writings of a scientist who was a Christian

28:05.680 --> 28:13.760
who drew my attention to something Alfred North Whitehead wrote. And it was really put in much

28:13.760 --> 28:20.160
simpler language by C.S. Lewis when he wrote, men became scientific because they expected

28:20.160 --> 28:25.600
law and nature, and they expected law and nature because they believed it a law giver.

28:25.600 --> 28:33.040
And so very early on, and I was fascinated by the idea that actually modern science

28:33.840 --> 28:41.040
is a legacy of the biblical worldview. And therefore it's no accident that the pioneers,

28:41.760 --> 28:49.280
Galileo, Kepler, Newton, Maxwell, and so on were believers in God. And as you pointed out,

28:50.560 --> 28:56.400
it underpins the tradition that lies behind the great universities of the world, that the doctrine

28:56.400 --> 29:05.280
of creation was actually the belief, the underlying presupposition that allowed people to do science.

29:05.280 --> 29:12.000
So I've come over my life to the conclusion that science and the biblical worldviews sit very

29:12.000 --> 29:17.200
comfortably together, but it's science and atheism that do not sit comfortably together,

29:17.200 --> 29:21.200
which I know is quite a controversial statement, but at least it gets discussion going.

29:23.040 --> 29:30.880
Now, when I was in, I'm going to say the word again, all of you Scots out there,

29:30.880 --> 29:41.440
Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Edinburgh, New College, having a festival, Alistair McGrath made similar

29:41.440 --> 29:52.720
points. And again, we're facing what was sort of a, I mentioned in previous video, a lot of what

29:52.720 --> 29:59.120
has sort of reverberated through the last century was the modernist fundamentalist fight.

29:59.120 --> 30:10.640
And that fight was, it was certainly on the American scene. It was in Europe. And I think,

30:10.640 --> 30:21.520
in many ways, it's that fight that sort of set up the imagination that these two things are at odds,

30:21.520 --> 30:27.440
but I'll have to look for that McGrath video. We'll see if it's up yet. The university sometimes

30:27.520 --> 30:32.000
can be really slow about putting their stuff up. They have last year's up. Yeah, see, they've got

30:32.000 --> 30:38.400
NT Wright and they've got Rowan Williams, but they don't have this year's up yet. Anyway, when it

30:38.400 --> 30:43.280
gets up, I'm going to keep looking for it because Alistair McGrath's talk, I thought was excellent,

30:43.280 --> 30:48.560
and it touched on this. Completed a couple of documentaries with the Daily Wearer Plus crew,

30:48.560 --> 30:54.560
and one of them was in Athens and two were in Jerusalem. And we were trying to puzzle out the

30:55.520 --> 31:03.600
relationship between Greek thought and Judeo-Christian thought, most particularly the strange

31:04.240 --> 31:12.320
happenstance that the Greek idea of an intrinsic logos in the world seemed to dovetail with the

31:13.040 --> 31:20.080
Judeo-Christian idea of, you might say, of the word incarnate in the human psyche. And

31:20.880 --> 31:28.000
it seemed to me and obviously to other observers that there was an affinity between the Greek

31:28.000 --> 31:35.920
idea that the cosmos had an intrinsic comprehensibility and the idea that the proper orientation

31:35.920 --> 31:42.400
for human beings ethically would be one of honest communication and investigation. And

31:43.040 --> 31:48.960
those two things snapped on top of each other. It made me think of something that I actually

31:48.960 --> 31:55.280
learned from Richard Dawkins, and I think this is a deep idea. Dawkins wrote a very influential

31:55.280 --> 32:05.120
essay where he claimed that any organism that can function in an environment has to be a microcosm

32:05.120 --> 32:12.560
of that environment. So for example, if you were an alien biologist and you were presented with a

32:12.560 --> 32:20.320
terrestrial bird and you took the bird apart, you could infer from the bird's structure the

32:20.320 --> 32:26.960
gravitational pull of the earth, the density of the atmosphere, the chemical composition of the

32:26.960 --> 32:34.560
atmosphere, the electron. Remember what Viveki said about relationality? Now sort of here is

32:34.560 --> 32:38.560
implicit that well sort of the environment comes first and then the bird comes second.

32:39.520 --> 32:44.960
But of course the environment and the bird are of course, they're working at different speeds,

32:44.960 --> 32:54.640
but they are also both changing. And so it's sort of the correlation between the two. And again,

32:54.640 --> 33:01.440
the conceptualization of the two itself is also a product of a lot of this. But the correlation

33:01.440 --> 33:09.920
of the two is in fact this relationality. The electromagnetic frequency that the sunlight

33:09.920 --> 33:16.480
was, what would you say, at what electromagnetic frequencies the sun's light was most amenable

33:16.480 --> 33:25.440
to vision, etc. You could derive a model of the environment from the physiology of the organism.

33:25.440 --> 33:32.240
Now I know that there were medieval ideas that were deep in Christianity that the human soul

33:32.240 --> 33:37.360
was a microcosm of the cosmos, that it reflected the structure of reality itself. And I've been

33:37.360 --> 33:44.240
thinking about this in terms of how the world might be best conceptualized. So there's a mix

33:44.240 --> 33:51.120
of ideas here. And if an organism has to be a microcosm of the cosmos in order to function,

33:51.840 --> 33:59.280
and we are a microcosm in that regard, and we are a personality that runs on a narrative,

33:59.280 --> 34:06.240
which we seem to be, then in what way is it reasonable to claim that the cosmos itself

34:07.040 --> 34:11.760
is best conceptualized as something that could be entered into relationship with

34:11.760 --> 34:17.200
personality to personality, and that that's not the most fundamental reflection of reality. I mean,

34:17.200 --> 34:24.160
it seems to me that that's where Dawkins thought eventually points, if his proclamation that

34:24.880 --> 34:30.560
an organism has to be a microcosm, an accurate microcosm in order to survive is accurate. So

34:31.600 --> 34:39.120
now that. Long, long time ago, for those of you who have been watching this channel for years,

34:39.120 --> 34:49.120
and there are a few thousand of you. Pascal, spirit of finesse, spirit of geometry,

34:49.120 --> 34:55.120
should have been triggered by this. Years ago, when I was talking to John Varvakey about this,

34:55.120 --> 35:01.920
when I, when I first came across, you know, it's interesting how much Pascal is in Lewis,

35:01.920 --> 35:08.160
as I've been reading this biography of Lewis by Alistair McGrath. I should really do a much

35:08.160 --> 35:12.240
deeper dive into Pascal himself, because Pascal seemed to figure a lot of the stuff out. And,

35:12.240 --> 35:20.480
of course, Pascal was very early in, you know, early modern period. But this, basically, I hear,

35:20.480 --> 35:27.520
I hear Peterson talking about, this is the spirit of finesse, that the way and this sort of connects

35:27.520 --> 35:37.280
up with the mode that you have to enter into when dealing with persons is the appropriate mode for

35:37.280 --> 35:42.400
religion. Now, the spirit of geometry is an appropriate mode. This also sort of maps on to

35:42.400 --> 35:48.320
Ian McGilchrist's two hemispheres of the brain. But the spirit of finesse is the proper mode,

35:48.320 --> 35:54.880
because now take this, this idea that he brought from Dawkins. The reason that

35:56.240 --> 36:00.960
religion is shaped the way it is, and this is where Peter Atkins is told, well, there's, if

36:00.960 --> 36:06.400
there's an equation in it, no, you don't understand. And every time Brett Weinstein starts talking about

36:06.400 --> 36:12.720
this updating of wisdom, and that the old rules, and he's thinking about that religions are these,

36:12.720 --> 36:16.640
these books of rules, and what religious people are, is they just keep following these little

36:16.640 --> 36:21.440
rules. Now, again, rules are handy things, and rules are good things, and rules are fine. But you

36:21.440 --> 36:27.840
cannot sort of reduce everything down to these little rules, because of this divide that Pascal

36:27.840 --> 36:32.720
noted between sort of these two modes, the spirit of finesse and the spirit of geometry,

36:32.720 --> 36:37.120
rule-based is sort of geometry, you can reduce geometry down into a bunch of rules.

36:38.560 --> 36:46.400
But you can't pursue life that way. And I think John Revecky runs through well,

36:46.400 --> 36:51.440
why sort of this rule-based approach doesn't work, because of commentatorial explosiveness,

36:51.440 --> 36:59.440
because the number of rules that you would need, multiplies infinitely, because of the

36:59.440 --> 37:02.400
commentatorial explosiveness of the world. Now, if you don't know what commentatorial

37:02.400 --> 37:06.320
explosiveness is, you can go watch Awakening for the Meaning Crisis, it's this thing that I run

37:06.320 --> 37:12.240
through. It's the basis of what led Jordan to a whole bunch of this, that via cognitive science,

37:12.240 --> 37:17.680
what we do when we engage productively with the world is a massive compressive and reduction

37:17.680 --> 37:24.480
effort to sort of break the world down into sizable parts that we can productively engage

37:24.480 --> 37:32.880
with. In other words, we engage with the logos of the world productively, because things sort of

37:32.880 --> 37:40.000
scale and they fractal down. I don't know if that made any sense to you, but it made sense to me.

37:40.560 --> 37:46.880
Dovetails with the idea that the logos as a personality, so that would be the Judeo-Christian

37:46.880 --> 37:53.920
concept, can investigate the logos of the universe and that those things dovetail. So now, I know

37:53.920 --> 38:00.320
that's a conflict. And of course, the image of God is in there too. We are made in God's image,

38:00.320 --> 38:08.480
and this personality, this personhood, this spirit of finesse, this mode of person, of relationality

38:09.600 --> 38:16.640
is, in fact, the mode that we properly, we are like God in that way. We are children of God in

38:16.720 --> 38:21.200
that way. Paul uses that phrase in the book of Acts. And...

38:22.400 --> 38:25.920
...mismash of ideas, but I'm interested in your thoughts on that.

38:25.920 --> 38:27.280
No, those are good ideas, Jordan.

38:28.080 --> 38:35.920
Well, I think there's a lot in that actually. And I recall listening to you, you have a very

38:35.920 --> 38:42.880
interesting lecture on Genesis 1. And when you came to this statement that human beings are made

38:42.880 --> 38:49.760
in the image of God, you paused and you pointed out that this was the cornerstone of our civilization.

38:49.760 --> 38:56.800
And I agree with that entirely. I think that what Dawkins is saying actually points to the exact

38:56.800 --> 39:02.880
opposite direction to what his worldview is, which is atheism, of course. In other words,

39:02.880 --> 39:10.880
that we can read off from creation something about the idea of a creator.

39:10.880 --> 39:20.560
Now, we got to clean up this language. Atheism, of course. Okay, that's a shorthand for

39:22.560 --> 39:31.200
that there is no governing, there is no governance of the, there is no personal governance of the

39:31.200 --> 39:38.480
universe that we can relate to. So often, when we talk about God, this is what we're talking about.

39:38.480 --> 39:43.440
And will Christians believe they can relate to the personal governance of the universe?

39:43.440 --> 39:50.400
And Jordan Peterson basically made the argument that our person, our person ship, and I would,

39:51.760 --> 40:00.080
I would push his argument even further that the evidence of the productivity of our person ship

40:00.080 --> 40:09.200
in the universe and the capacity of the personal to colonize, and C.S. Lewis again goes through

40:09.200 --> 40:15.360
this quite a bit in his book, Miracles, to colonize and manage and master the impersonal

40:16.320 --> 40:24.400
is suggestive of the very fabric of the universe that the universe, in fact, is personal. Now,

40:24.400 --> 40:28.560
one might argue, he's gonna flip this around and play devil's advocate that this is only

40:28.560 --> 40:38.800
projection on our part. The difficulty with that argument is the universe seems receptive to person

40:38.800 --> 40:49.360
hood. What C.S. Lewis does in Miracles is he uses reason and what's really helpful is to recognize

40:50.080 --> 40:55.760
the ancient relationship between reason and this logos that Peterson is talking about. I

40:55.760 --> 41:02.640
noticed this in Romans 12 on Sunday. You can see I have my Sunday school class up on the channel too,

41:03.280 --> 41:08.080
but very famous passage. Therefore, I urge you brothers and sisters in view of God's mercy

41:08.080 --> 41:12.320
to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God. And this is your

41:13.280 --> 41:17.680
Lexham English Bible says reasonable service. And if he says true and proper service,

41:18.320 --> 41:25.600
the RSV translation I grew up on was spiritual worship. And well, what is that? What is that?

41:25.680 --> 41:34.160
What is that word beneath it? Well, it's this funny word that its root is in, its root is in logos.

41:34.160 --> 41:42.160
And sometimes it's translated reasonable or rational and sometimes it's translated spiritual.

41:42.160 --> 41:48.240
Well, what does that mean? What is the connection? Because if you would ask a modern, the logical

41:48.240 --> 41:54.480
and the spiritual would seem out of source, but not if the spiritual is basically held together

41:54.480 --> 42:02.240
and managed by the logos. It's the logos. It's, it's logos is the proper worship because you're

42:02.240 --> 42:11.920
worshiping in line with the logos. So, so C.S. Lewis, there is then a God who is not a part of

42:11.920 --> 42:17.280
nature, but nothing has yet been said to show that he must have created her. Might God and nature

42:17.280 --> 42:23.040
both be self-existent and totally independent of each other? If you thought, and this is sort of

42:23.120 --> 42:28.480
what you imagine, say, a sky daddy or super thing or something with something of that nature.

42:29.920 --> 42:34.560
If you thought you would be a dualist and you would hold a view in which I consider manlier

42:34.560 --> 42:39.440
and more reasonable than any form of naturalism, you might be many worse things than a dualist,

42:39.440 --> 42:44.640
but I not fit, but I do not think dualism is true. There's an enormous difficulty conceiving two

42:44.640 --> 42:49.760
things which simply coexist and have no other relation. If this difficulty sometimes escapes

42:49.760 --> 42:54.720
our notice, that is because we are victims of picture thinking. We really imagine them side

42:54.720 --> 43:01.360
by side in some kind of space, but of course, if they are both in a common space or a common time

43:01.360 --> 43:07.520
or any kind of common medium whatsoever, they both would be part of a system and in fact of a nature.

43:08.720 --> 43:13.280
Even if we succeed in eliminating such, such pictures, the mere fact of our think, of our

43:13.280 --> 43:18.320
trying to think of them together slurs over the real difficulty because for that moment anyway,

43:18.320 --> 43:23.920
our own mind is a common medium. If there can be such a thing as sheer otherness,

43:23.920 --> 43:31.280
if things can coexist and no more, coexist and no more, it is at any rate conceptual in our mind

43:31.280 --> 43:37.840
cannot form. And in the present instance, it seems especially gratuitous to try to form it,

43:37.840 --> 43:43.040
for if we already know that God and nature have come into a certain relation, they have at the

43:43.040 --> 43:50.560
very least a relation almost in one sense a common frontier in every human mind. The relation

43:50.560 --> 43:56.240
which arises at that frontier are indeed the most complicated and intimate sort. That spearhead of

43:56.240 --> 44:03.680
the supernatural capital S, which I call my reason links up to all my natural contents, my sensations,

44:03.680 --> 44:10.080
emotions and the like. So completely that I call the mixture by a single word me. Again,

44:10.960 --> 44:16.400
that is what I came called the unsymmetrical character of the frontier relations.

44:17.200 --> 44:21.520
When the physical state of the brain dominates my thinking, it produces only disorder,

44:21.520 --> 44:27.440
but my brain does not become any less a brain when it is dominated by reason capital R. Now again,

44:28.240 --> 44:33.840
if you hear reason, you think, oh, Sam Harris, think of reason more as right relation.

44:34.240 --> 44:42.160
And think of reason in terms of this Greek word, which is, has its roots sort of in this logos,

44:42.160 --> 44:46.960
because that's sort of the thing that holds it together. It's this common medium.

44:48.960 --> 44:54.080
The military metaphor of a spearhead is perhaps apparently ill-chosen. The supernatural reason

44:54.080 --> 45:01.360
enters my natural being not like a weapon, more like a beam of light which illuminates

45:02.320 --> 45:08.480
or a principle of organization which unifies and develops. Our whole picture of nature being

45:08.480 --> 45:16.000
invaded, as if by a foreign enemy, was wrong. When we actually examine one of these invasions,

45:16.000 --> 45:22.800
it looks much more like the arrival of a king among his own subjects, or a Mahut visiting

45:22.800 --> 45:28.800
his own elephant. You have an elephant in a rider image. Look at that. The elephant may run amuck.

45:28.880 --> 45:33.680
Nature may be rebellious, but from observing what happens when nature obeys,

45:34.960 --> 45:42.640
it is almost impossible not to conclude that it is her very nature to be subject. All happens

45:42.640 --> 45:52.640
as if she has been designed for that very role. And this, I think, is really what they are driving

45:52.640 --> 46:00.320
at here. That, well, science seems to give us knowledge. Now, it can give us knowledge in

46:00.320 --> 46:05.360
certain domains. Science struggles, in fact, to give us knowledge of itself, as John Verveke

46:05.360 --> 46:12.480
points out numerous times. But the fact that it works as well as it does, even with us, suggests,

46:12.480 --> 46:21.440
as C.S. Lewis says, that it is in fact a king, not science is the king, but personhood is the king,

46:21.440 --> 46:31.040
and the immaterial world is, in fact, nature, or the material world is, in fact, nature.

46:31.040 --> 46:35.760
And that's the kind of thing that we have, we experience in white technology,

46:35.760 --> 46:43.280
is such a deep temptation for us because suddenly we are filled with our sensation of

46:43.280 --> 46:50.000
our mastery over the world. And this, again, connects back up with the image of God.

46:50.720 --> 46:58.320
And as you say, it dovetails perfectly. Let me put this another way. I'm a mathematician by

46:58.320 --> 47:03.760
background and a linguist. I love language, and mathematics is a very sophisticated language,

47:03.760 --> 47:11.040
but I love natural languages as well. And it seems to me that where this fits together best

47:11.840 --> 47:19.920
is first in the fact that we can do science in the sense that there is a rational intelligibility

47:20.000 --> 47:26.640
to the universe, which is the foundation of modern science and is a legacy of the biblical

47:26.640 --> 47:33.440
worldview, so that the mathematical describability Einstein talked about,

47:33.440 --> 47:40.080
he couldn't imagine any genuine scientists without faith in that. It's the axiom for doing

47:40.080 --> 47:45.600
science is to believe the universe is intelligible. But if you ask for the rationale behind that,

47:46.160 --> 47:54.880
again, not just intelligible, subjectable, that the universe in fact is subject to us,

47:54.880 --> 48:00.720
and this, of course, is Genesis 1. Now, to the degree to which we are good stewards of this power,

48:01.520 --> 48:07.520
the universe rebels against us because our subjection of it is not the kind of proper

48:07.520 --> 48:13.760
subjection, but let's say the good master has to its dog who loves and cares for his dog.

48:13.760 --> 48:20.160
Rafe and I talked about this in our conversation, but in fact, the exploiter who does not care

48:20.880 --> 48:28.960
for the domain to which he has been given dominion, but in fact merely exploits and abuses.

48:30.080 --> 48:36.400
We believe the universe is intelligible. It bears the imprint of a creator, and I see that at the

48:36.400 --> 48:43.680
level of mathematics in its capacity to, at least in part, gives a handle on what's out there,

48:43.680 --> 48:49.520
and also biology, where we have at the heart of every living cell the longest word we've ever

48:49.520 --> 48:56.640
found, the genetic code. And all of that leads me to formulate it as follows, that we live in a

48:56.640 --> 49:04.640
word-based universe, and that's the key of the Logos for me. Okay, and so what do you mean in that

49:04.640 --> 49:10.640
case? So what do you mean specifically that we live in a word-based universe? What does that mean

49:10.640 --> 49:17.600
for you on the broader conceptual landscape? Well, now that's a super important question,

49:17.600 --> 49:23.120
because again, I believe in God. I don't believe in God. The book of James says, well, the devils

49:23.120 --> 49:29.600
believe in God. They perhaps in some ways have clearer knowledge of God. If you think about

49:29.600 --> 49:33.840
knowledge in terms of propositional knowledge, if you think about knowledge in terms of this

49:33.840 --> 49:40.800
disembodied, abstract saber, if you use Spanish instead of cono sed, this kind of knowledge,

49:40.800 --> 49:51.040
they certainly have that, but how about intimate knowledge? How about relational knowledge? Because

49:52.480 --> 50:00.160
it's that's where all of this begins getting interesting. You can know that the girl across

50:00.160 --> 50:08.880
the classroom is named Fulana, but to know her personally is a whole other thing.

50:10.160 --> 50:19.200
Well, it means that this universe is not simply a product of natural unguided forces. It is a

50:19.200 --> 50:25.200
product of a rational creator, an intelligent creator, and I believe even more than that,

50:25.200 --> 50:33.200
a personal creator. Now, how I get there is only in part from a response to the universe as I find

50:33.200 --> 50:41.440
it, the point you made about each organism being a microcosm of its environment. It's also, it seems

50:41.440 --> 50:48.080
to me that there are two sources, two major sources of knowledge. There is, first of all,

50:48.080 --> 50:55.760
observing the universe, science, etc. Then there are the humanities, but there's also the concept of

50:55.760 --> 51:03.120
revelation in which I believe. In other words, it's not simply the human quest for the creator,

51:03.120 --> 51:09.760
it's the creator revealing himself. So, for me, the anchor point in the end is that the

51:09.760 --> 51:17.760
logos became human and we beheld his glory. In other words, we can see exactly what this means

51:17.840 --> 51:25.760
in terms of what we can understand. That is the human being in which God encoded himself in Christ.

51:25.760 --> 51:30.480
Those are big ideas, of course. They're very deep ideas. They need unpacking,

51:30.480 --> 51:37.040
but that's essentially where I'm coming from. Okay, so now Lennox is going to bring out

51:38.000 --> 51:43.680
argument made by Alvin Plantinga, made by C.S. Lewis, made before Lewis. I forget exactly who

51:43.680 --> 51:50.960
Lewis cites for this argument, that in fact, if the universe is a product of randomness, would you

51:50.960 --> 52:01.280
entrust yourself to this type of product? I'm jumping ahead a little bit, but this gets into

52:01.920 --> 52:05.920
some of that and it gets into, again, the combinatorial explosiveness that you need.

52:05.920 --> 52:11.280
Facts need prioritization. That's what values do. Again, Peterson's talked about this quite a bit

52:11.360 --> 52:19.040
and he continues working through this. The scientific truth that's truest and beneficial

52:19.040 --> 52:25.680
simultaneously is actually the conjunction in this Athens Jerusalem sense. It's actually the

52:25.680 --> 52:33.120
conjunction of the intrinsic logic of the objective world making itself manifest to the

52:33.120 --> 52:38.800
truthful penetrating psyche of the human observer. It's the interaction between those two that

52:38.800 --> 52:45.280
constitute scientific truth and not one or the other. There's no getting, see, and what the

52:45.280 --> 52:51.760
atheist materialists would like to do is to say, well, the world of facts speaks for itself,

52:51.760 --> 52:56.080
but that's also technically untrue because there's an infinite number of facts.

52:56.080 --> 53:01.280
They're certainly not all relevant. We can drown in the plethora of facts. That's the

53:01.280 --> 53:07.120
combinatorial explosiveness point. We certainly will do that and to even communicate about them

53:07.120 --> 53:13.120
or study them or even draw our attention to them. We have to prioritize and hierarchically arrange

53:13.120 --> 53:18.480
the facts and we do that according to an ethic and I think that's actually, I think that is

53:18.480 --> 53:24.720
incontrovertible on scientific grounds because we have seen the emergent realization in a whole

53:24.720 --> 53:31.440
variety of domains, AI not least, that there are facts, but those facts have to be prioritized

53:31.440 --> 53:36.880
and you prioritize facts with an ethic. That's absolutely right. There's a deeper problem

53:36.880 --> 53:43.440
it seems to me with the atheist understanding of science and that is this. And again,

53:46.080 --> 53:53.280
this yes or no God has become shorthand for a whole bunch of other consequential beliefs

53:53.280 --> 53:57.200
and ideas. And so he says, atheist, okay, they're going to fight over this word again,

53:57.760 --> 54:02.960
but his point is, well, what exactly is the nature of the universe? Is the universe intelligible?

54:02.960 --> 54:07.440
And if the universe isn't intelligible, what are the implications of that intelligibility?

54:08.560 --> 54:15.920
And what are the implications if in fact, our intelligibility is merely illusory?

54:16.720 --> 54:22.800
That we do the science with our minds. Some people think the mind and the brain are the same. I

54:22.800 --> 54:29.360
leave that aside since you're an expert on the mind and the brain. But I often say to people,

54:30.320 --> 54:35.200
you know, what do you do science with? I've asked many leading scientists this,

54:35.200 --> 54:40.960
they say, well, I do it with my mind and my brain. Give me a brief account of the brain.

54:40.960 --> 54:46.160
And they say to me, well, the brain is the end product of a mindless, unguided process.

54:46.160 --> 54:52.320
And I pause and I look up straight at the eye and I smile and I say, and you trust it. Tell me

54:52.320 --> 54:58.480
honestly, if you knew that the computer you use or the machinery you use in the lab

54:59.040 --> 55:04.560
was the end product of a mindless, unguided process, would you trust it? And the interesting thing,

55:04.560 --> 55:10.240
I've done a lot of experiments with this little story and I've always got the answer, no, I would

55:10.240 --> 55:16.400
not. So I say, you have a problem. In other words, your atheism is undermining the very

55:16.400 --> 55:22.080
rationality you use not only to do science, but to construct any argument whatsoever. It's not

55:22.160 --> 55:27.040
only shooting itself at the foot, it's worse than shooting itself at the brain. Let me,

55:27.920 --> 55:36.240
and there's an example of John Lennox. Now this is a killer argument. And as again,

55:36.240 --> 55:40.240
it's at this point that you just have to say, okay, he just landed a killer argument.

55:41.440 --> 55:48.560
Do all the atheists just say, oh, okay, well, no, we don't change world views that way.

55:49.440 --> 55:55.360
Just like, okay, Fulana comes over and introduces herself. Okay, well, it's going to take time,

55:55.360 --> 56:02.240
it's going to take process, because all of this getting to know one another and know what the

56:02.240 --> 56:07.280
world looks like from a different point of view, and know the implications of all of these ideas,

56:07.280 --> 56:14.400
and even how in fact, these ideas that we are sort of crunching in this part of our mind,

56:14.400 --> 56:20.720
which is conscious, is related to sort of the emergence of the ideas. Well,

56:22.640 --> 56:27.760
we don't know. Now Peterson is about to go through this, and it's a very interesting thing because

56:27.760 --> 56:31.680
he says, you know, these ideas appear to us. This is like revelation. Now that's,

56:32.480 --> 56:40.960
that itself is a whole other interesting idea. And, and it's, I think it's a powerful point. I

56:40.960 --> 56:48.560
don't know if, if I can go as far with it as Peterson would like to go with it, because,

56:49.920 --> 56:55.840
and I don't think it's, I don't think it's wrong-headed, but it gets, it gets again to this

56:55.840 --> 57:04.080
point that what is, what is it exactly that you want from Jordan? If Jordan would suddenly go

57:04.080 --> 57:12.640
to a church, if Jordan would suddenly go to your church, well, you'd probably be excited and giddy

57:12.640 --> 57:17.600
about that for a day or an hour, or maybe even a whole week or a month. But after that, it would

57:17.600 --> 57:22.640
just kind of become normal things. And then in fact, if you had a little church fight in your

57:22.640 --> 57:30.800
church over the color of the carpet, or others over some doctrinal, doctrinal position, etc, etc,

57:31.120 --> 57:33.520
and Jordan was on the other side of it, you'd be annoyed with him.

57:37.120 --> 57:45.200
These conversations are excellent because what they help us do is continue to process these,

57:47.120 --> 57:53.760
that they help us do the work of engaging with a world

57:54.560 --> 58:06.240
that is filled with the logos of God. And the process isn't just about sort of getting our

58:06.240 --> 58:12.720
thoughts straight, we have to do that. I had a person come up to me just last Sunday, and somehow

58:13.280 --> 58:19.920
I quote Lewis a lot in my sermons, and, and she came up to me and she's a dear, lovely, wonderful

58:20.560 --> 58:29.200
woman. And she said, you know, I got this book, Mere Christianity, and I started reading it,

58:29.200 --> 58:37.840
and it's hard, I don't understand it. And some of you might say, mere Christianity,

58:37.840 --> 58:44.240
that's the easy one, read miracles, or even read his scholarly stuff, you know,

58:44.800 --> 58:52.240
preface to Paradise Lost, or his Oxford English Literature book, or, you know,

58:52.960 --> 58:56.720
yeah, Lewis can get a lot harder than Mere Christianity. Mere Christianity was pitched

58:56.720 --> 59:06.800
to a radio audience in England during the war. But for many people, that's just not the wavelength

59:06.800 --> 59:12.400
that they're at, and all the think-y-talk-y stuff. For some of us, that's, you know, that's where things

59:12.400 --> 59:20.000
are, and that's absolutely fine. But for many people, they aren't. And it's amazing how much sense

59:20.000 --> 59:27.920
people can make through sort of this personal relationship mode. And I think, in fact, it's

59:27.920 --> 59:35.440
a deeply powerful mode, and it's the mode that, in fact, in many cases trumps the other mode.

59:36.080 --> 59:42.400
People don't care how much you think until they, until they, people don't care how much you know,

59:42.400 --> 59:47.680
until they know how much you care. There's only these little pastor turnaround things that are

59:47.680 --> 59:54.000
semi-easy to remember. You can see I didn't remember it right the first time. But anyway,

59:54.000 --> 59:59.280
I don't, I don't know how much more I'll do with this video, as with all the daily wire things,

59:59.280 --> 01:00:03.520
there's another half hour. I haven't actually listened to the last half hour. I very much want

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:09.840
to, because I very much enjoyed this conversation. And this has been the conversation that Christians

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:16.320
have been waiting for. But I don't think, in the end, a lot of people who are sort of playing the

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:21.520
tribal game are going to get out of the conversation what it is they're looking for. Well, maybe some

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:28.080
will, and that's great. But, you know, even, even with all the drama around Diane, Hersey, Ali,

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:36.960
there's a, there's a, it's sort of like Tom Brady winning the Super Bowl. I won the Super Bowl.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:44.000
I won it again. I won it again. I won it again. And he doesn't quite know when to retire.

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:51.440
But winning the Super Bowl isn't what it was. Now, you can apply some of Peterson's

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:58.080
ideas about meaning, how meaning is always in the reaching, not in the grabbing.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:07.120
And I think there's a lot of truth to that. And I think, again, the truth is that in this world,

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:13.920
we are always reaching, and the receiving comes in Christian terms, and this is what

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:18.320
Christians actually call it, the consummation. And you might say, consummation, that's a funny

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:27.360
word. Well, it's the same word that happens after the consummation of the marriage. It's a deep form

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:37.120
of knowing. It's not just knowing that. It's consummation. So maybe that's enough for this.

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:44.080
I'll keep an eye on the comments and we'll see, because there's a lot of videos I want to treat.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:47.600
There's a lot of stuff out there, but this, this was a good one. I absolutely recommend

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:56.800
watching it, but it's not, I don't even know what people are looking for with respect to the whole

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:07.120
Jordan Peterson Christian or no thing. It certainly is building a lot of popularity on

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:14.320
YouTube channels, but I don't think that game is what we think it is. Anyway, leave a comment.

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:15.040
Let me know what you think.
