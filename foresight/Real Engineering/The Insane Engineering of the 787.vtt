This episode of Real Engineering is brought to you by the CuriosityStream and Nebula Bundle

00:05.280 --> 00:12.140
Deal. Sign up now to watch the hour-long version of this video linked in the description.

00:12.140 --> 00:16.420
If you were not paying attention, you may not have noticed the revolution happening

00:16.420 --> 00:21.560
in the airline industry. The days of attempting to build bigger and bigger airliners like

00:21.560 --> 00:32.000
the 850-passenger double-decker A380 and the 660-passenger Humt 747 are gone. The behemoths

00:32.000 --> 00:38.920
are simply being outcompeted by a new generation of planes. Many mourn the slow demise of these

00:38.920 --> 00:46.240
iconic planes, but you are benefiting from this change. The entire nature of air travel

00:46.240 --> 00:52.280
has changed to benefit you and your needs. Your local airport has more direct flights

00:52.280 --> 00:58.600
to distant lands than ever before, and the price of those tickets are cheaper than ever.

00:58.600 --> 01:04.120
Connecting flights are becoming rarer and rarer as this new breed of plane takes over.

01:04.120 --> 01:11.520
The plane at the forefront of this revolution? The 787 Dreamliner. A 30 billion dollar bet

01:11.520 --> 01:17.760
on the future of the airline industry. Boeing sat at the poker table and pushed all their

01:17.760 --> 01:25.000
chips forward. An all-in bet on a radical new future. And it paid off.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.680
The 787 revolutionized not only how the airline industry operates, but how the future of planes

01:31.680 --> 01:39.960
will be designed and built. This is the breakdown of the 787's materials. By weight, 55% of

01:39.960 --> 01:46.600
the 787 is made from composite materials, like carbon fibre reinforced plastics, making

01:46.600 --> 01:52.520
it the first commercial airliner made primarily with this new age material.

01:52.520 --> 02:03.200
The 787 is rivalled only by the Airbus A350XWB introduced 4 years after the 787 in 2015. So,

02:03.200 --> 02:09.480
why are composite materials so desirable for the airline industry, and how has the 787

02:09.680 --> 02:12.960
made the most of their advantages?

02:12.960 --> 02:18.880
Composite materials are made up of two or more materials. Take carbon reinforced plastics.

02:18.880 --> 02:25.520
They are composed of extremely strong carbon fibres bound together by a plastic resin.

02:25.520 --> 02:31.960
Carbon fibre, made up of thousands of tiny thin fibres of carbon, is incredibly strong

02:31.960 --> 02:37.920
in tension. Up to 5 times stronger than steel, and one-fifth of its weight.

02:38.400 --> 02:45.040
These tiny fibres can't create a solid part by themselves. This is an image of a human hair

02:45.040 --> 02:51.600
beside a carbon fibre. The carbon fibre is the smaller one, and just like a human hair,

02:51.600 --> 02:57.920
they can bend and flex and separate very easily. So, we need to first bind them together with

02:57.920 --> 03:04.080
a plastic resin to form a solid material. Otherwise, they just form a strong but flexible

03:04.080 --> 03:10.880
fabric. That flexibility as a fabric is exactly what makes composites so useful when creating the

03:10.880 --> 03:17.280
precise and elegant curves of a plane. With the right tooling and designers, composite components

03:17.280 --> 03:23.360
can be made into almost any shape imaginable. In the past, a disadvantage of making large

03:23.360 --> 03:29.680
aircraft components from composites was the time taken to manually lay up parts, where layers of

03:29.680 --> 03:35.920
carbon fibre and plastic resin had to be carefully constructed. It required skilled technicians,

03:35.920 --> 03:40.720
and was inherently difficult to scale to the production quantities Boeing needed.

03:41.280 --> 03:47.680
To get around this, Boeing uses automated tape laying to produce massive aircraft sections.

03:47.680 --> 03:54.480
The 787's fuselage is created by wrapping a carbon fibre tape impregnated with a plastic resin

03:54.480 --> 04:01.360
around a rotating mould of the fuselage. This machine precisely controls the overlaps of the tape

04:01.360 --> 04:08.000
and the orientation of the fibres to ensure we are getting the most out of the carbon's tensile

04:08.000 --> 04:14.400
strength to resist the internal pressure loads and the longitudinal bending loads the fuselage

04:14.400 --> 04:20.000
will experience. One of the problems with this manufacturing method is that the part needs to

04:20.000 --> 04:25.680
be placed inside an oven to cure the resin. This hardens the plastic and creates a solid

04:25.680 --> 04:32.400
composite structure. Ovens the size of a wide body jet airliner fuselage are not exactly common,

04:32.400 --> 04:38.320
and this is often the limiting factor on parts made this way, and requires massive upfront

04:38.320 --> 04:45.360
investment to build a customised oven large enough to fit the part, but the benefits are well worth

04:46.080 --> 04:51.840
The first and most obvious is the strength carbon fibre provides. Previous generation

04:51.840 --> 04:57.920
airliners are typically pressurised to an equivalent of 8,000 feet. That's the same height as Mount

04:57.920 --> 05:04.000
Olympus in Washington State. High enough that the lower pressure would reduce your oxygen intake

05:04.000 --> 05:10.160
and your stomach will bloat as the air inside is higher pressure than the outside. This is

05:10.160 --> 05:16.800
uncomfortable and exacerbates the effects of jet lag, but thanks to the 787 stronger fuselage

05:16.800 --> 05:24.720
it can increase its internal air pressure to an equivalent of 6,000 feet, 25% lower in altitude

05:24.720 --> 05:31.040
and about 7.3% higher in pressure. That may not sound like a lot, but it goes a long way

05:31.040 --> 05:36.400
in making the journey more comfortable, and at the very least the person next to you won't be

05:36.400 --> 05:43.200
farting as much. Less farting is always nice, but my favourite benefit of the stronger fuselage

05:43.200 --> 05:50.800
is the absolutely massive windows. This is the 787 window, and these are windows of some equivalent

05:50.800 --> 05:58.240
aluminium airliners. They are absolutely massive. In aircraft made primarily from aluminium,

05:58.240 --> 06:03.760
having holes this large in metal panels would result in the build up of stress at the window

06:04.720 --> 06:10.080
as the stress contours have to deviate around the window. This stress does not exceed the

06:10.080 --> 06:16.400
material strength, but over repeated pressure cycles, tiny imperfections in the metal can grow

06:16.400 --> 06:22.480
into even larger cracks and eventually fail. Holes this large in an aluminium airliner would

06:22.480 --> 06:28.080
severely shorten the plane's flying career before it needed to be fixed or disposed of.

06:28.160 --> 06:34.160
Kind of like how cracks in McGregor's leg shortened his career, but it's not a problem for the 787

06:34.160 --> 06:39.360
thanks to composite's relative immunity to fatigue. You could kick Dustin Purir's kneecap

06:39.360 --> 06:45.200
as many times as you like with carbon fibre shins. The carbon fibre construction provides plenty of

06:45.200 --> 06:51.520
benefits for the airline operators too, because the fuselage is just one massive part. Boeing was

06:51.520 --> 06:57.920
able to eliminate all joints and all the fasteners needed to join them together. The sections that

06:57.920 --> 07:05.360
used to be made up of 1500 aluminium sheets riveted together using 40 to 50 000 fasteners

07:05.360 --> 07:12.480
are now just one massive carbon fibre section. Carbon fibre strength to weight ratio already

07:12.480 --> 07:17.920
makes the fuselage lighter, but eliminating joints and fasteners makes it even lighter again.

07:18.480 --> 07:25.360
The reduced weight reduces fuel burn, but this fuselage is also incredibly aerodynamic

07:25.360 --> 07:30.720
because it doesn't have thousands of little bumps and ridges all over it from those joints and

07:30.720 --> 07:36.320
rivets. These surface imperfections make the plane's surface rough and cause it to disturb

07:36.320 --> 07:42.800
more airflow, increasing parasitic drag. Composite materials help reduce drag in other ways too.

07:43.440 --> 07:49.840
One of my favourite things about the 787 is its elegant wings. The main structural member of a

07:49.840 --> 07:55.760
wing is the wingspan. Its primary role is to resist the upwards bending force during flight.

07:55.760 --> 08:02.800
It's essentially just an i-beam, a shape optimised to resist bending loads. The wingspan of the 787

08:02.800 --> 08:08.000
are constructed from carbon fibre composites, while the ribs, the structural members connecting

08:08.000 --> 08:13.280
the two spares, and that support the wingskin are machined out of solid aluminium plates.

08:13.840 --> 08:19.520
The structure, the rear and forward wingspan form with ribs running between is called

08:19.520 --> 08:26.160
the wing box and it forms the main load bearing structure of the wing, while also being a literal

08:26.160 --> 08:32.080
box for fuel to sit inside. The carbon fibre composite spare provides the wing fantastic

08:32.080 --> 08:37.200
strength. Strength is quantified by the force required to completely fracture material,

08:37.200 --> 08:42.480
but carbon fibre composites have another important quality that makes them perfect for aircraft

08:42.480 --> 08:49.440
wings, their maximum elastic strain. There are two types of deformation, elastic and plastic

08:49.440 --> 08:55.600
deformation. Elastic means the material will snap back into its original shape after the load is

08:55.600 --> 09:01.840
removed, like an elastic band. Plastic means it will permanently deform and won't return to its

09:01.840 --> 09:08.720
original shape once the load is removed, something we don't want to happen. This is permanent damage.

09:09.440 --> 09:15.520
Carbon fibre composites can deform further before they strike this plastic deformation zone

09:15.520 --> 09:21.840
at about 1.9%, while aircraft aluminium begins permanently deforming at less than 1%.

09:22.960 --> 09:28.640
That means we can bend carbon composites further before we need to worry about permanently deforming

09:28.640 --> 09:35.760
them, and that means we can make our wings super flexible. During flight, the wing tip of the 787

09:35.840 --> 09:42.480
can move upwards by 3 meters. That sounds like a lot, but in order to get certified by the FAA,

09:42.480 --> 09:49.920
every plane needs to be able to handle 150% of the plane's absolute maximum expected load during

09:49.920 --> 09:58.480
flight for 3 seconds. And during that test, the 787's wing bent upwards by 7.6 meters. That's

09:58.480 --> 10:04.800
a great deal of bending, despite carbon fibre composites being stiffer than aluminium, meaning

10:04.800 --> 10:11.840
it takes more force to deform the same volume of material. But critically, 787 wings are not the

10:11.840 --> 10:17.920
same shape as their aluminium counterparts. This ability to withstand greater bending allowed

10:17.920 --> 10:25.200
engineers to make the 787's wings with a much higher aspect ratio. Aspect ratio is the ratio

10:25.200 --> 10:31.840
between the wingspan and the mean cord, or wing width. A high aspect ratio would be a long skinny

10:31.840 --> 10:38.080
wing like a glider, while a low aspect ratio would be a delta wing of a fighter jet. A traditional

10:38.080 --> 10:45.760
airliner has an aspect ratio of about 9, like the 787's predecessor, the 777, but the 787

10:45.760 --> 10:53.440
has a massive aspect ratio at 11. This is what causes the 787's wings to flex so much during

10:53.440 --> 10:59.040
flight. Composites are actually stiffer than aluminium, but their ability to withstand

10:59.120 --> 11:06.240
high deformation allowed the engineers at Boeing to create a much higher aspect ratio wing, a longer,

11:06.240 --> 11:12.960
narrower wing that would bend more. But this comes with some huge benefits. The planes with the

11:12.960 --> 11:20.480
highest aspect ratio are gliders. For an unpowered plane, the highest priority is minimizing energy

11:20.480 --> 11:26.560
lost to drag. This allows the glider to stay in the air for extended periods with no engine.

11:26.560 --> 11:32.160
These types of aircraft typically have aspect ratios greater than 30, and these aircraft have

11:32.160 --> 11:38.480
the lowest drag penalties as a result of vortex drag. This is the drag caused by air mixing from

11:38.480 --> 11:43.760
the high pressure zone under the wing with low pressure air above the wing, forming vortices

11:43.760 --> 11:50.000
at the wing tip. By spreading the area of the wing over a longer span, we minimize the pressure that

11:50.000 --> 11:56.240
drives this mixing at the wing tip, and thus minimize the energy lost to the vortices.

11:56.240 --> 12:02.320
Normally, higher aspect ratio wings have lower internal volumes. For an unpowered glider,

12:02.320 --> 12:08.720
this isn't an issue. But for a plane that needs that storage space for fuel, it is. Less storage

12:08.720 --> 12:15.520
volume for fuel means lower range, and one of the primary goals of the 787 is to be an efficient,

12:15.520 --> 12:22.160
long-range aircraft capable of allowing airliners to open new routes that were once deemed impossible.

12:22.800 --> 12:29.600
Thankfully, modern planes like the 787 use a new kind of aerofoil, the supercritical aerofoil.

12:29.600 --> 12:34.960
Older aerofoils look something like this, a reasonably symmetric design with a sharp nose,

12:34.960 --> 12:40.240
and gentle curves on the upper and lower surface, and this is a supercritical wing.

12:40.800 --> 12:45.760
The leading edge is blunter with a larger radius, the top is relatively flat,

12:45.760 --> 12:51.600
and the lower portion has this strange cusp at the back. This aerofoil has much more useful

12:51.600 --> 12:57.200
internal volume thanks to its blunt leading edge and larger thickness-to-cord ratio.

12:57.760 --> 13:03.440
Helping solve our low internal volume problem associated with high aspect ratio wings,

13:04.000 --> 13:10.160
the supercritical wing was first tested by NASA on a modified TF-8A crusader,

13:10.160 --> 13:15.360
and you can really see the similarities in design ethos between the experimental plane's

13:15.360 --> 13:23.520
sleek wings with the 787. But increased internal volume is not why NASA developed the supercritical

13:23.520 --> 13:29.600
wing. NASA developed it to delay the onset of shockwave formation over the wings.

13:30.560 --> 13:36.240
When air travels over a wing, the air on top accelerates. This means that even though the

13:36.240 --> 13:42.320
plane itself might be travelling below the speed of sound, the air over the wing may break it and

13:42.320 --> 13:49.040
create a shockwave. This shockwave decreases lift and causes an increase in drag. This kind of drag

13:49.040 --> 13:55.280
is called wave drag, and planes need to fly below the speed this occurs at. The speed is called the

13:55.360 --> 14:01.680
critical Mach number. The supercritical wing was designed to increase the critical Mach number.

14:01.680 --> 14:07.680
The flat top of the supercritical wing means the air does not accelerate as much as it would over

14:07.680 --> 14:14.080
a classic aerofoil. Of course, this causes a loss in lift because that fast-moving air is

14:14.080 --> 14:20.160
causing a drop in pressure on top of the wing. To compensate, supercritical aerofoils have this

14:20.240 --> 14:26.480
concave curvature underneath the wing, which causes an increase of pressure there to compensate.

14:26.480 --> 14:31.760
This increase in pressure does not affect the critical Mach number, while the larger radius

14:31.760 --> 14:38.000
of the leading edge increases the lift generated at higher angles of attack. This is because air

14:38.000 --> 14:43.920
struggles to follow the tighter turns of a smaller radius leading edge, which causes earlier flow

14:43.920 --> 14:50.560
detachment and stall. The larger radius delays this flow separation. This aerofoil shape changes

14:50.560 --> 14:56.480
continually as you travel the length of the wing, twisting and curving in computer-calculated

14:56.480 --> 15:02.400
precision, optimizing the wing shape to be as efficient as possible, and composites provided

15:02.400 --> 15:08.000
the engineers with the confidence that these shapes could be manufactured. The skin is simply

15:08.000 --> 15:14.080
laid down on a mold with automated tape-laying once again. We don't have to beat metal into shape

15:14.080 --> 15:20.400
each and every time we want to recreate these delicate curves. The fibers of the wing have

15:20.400 --> 15:26.240
even been laid in specific patterns to tailor the stiffness of the wing in different areas.

15:26.240 --> 15:33.120
This means the wing deforms exactly as the 787's engineers wanted to as it gains speed.

15:33.120 --> 15:38.800
So the wing shape actually changes during flight to better suit the needs at different speeds.

15:39.360 --> 15:45.520
This is called aeroelastic tailoring and is the forefront of state-of-the-art aeronautical

15:45.520 --> 15:52.800
engineering today. The 787 also features a novel device designed to reduce turbulent flow over

15:52.800 --> 15:59.840
the tail of the aircraft. Two types of flow states exist in aerodynamics. Laminar flow occurs at low

15:59.840 --> 16:06.400
velocities and is characterized by fluid layers flowing smoothly over each other in neat orderly

16:06.400 --> 16:13.600
layers. Laminar flow is predictable and non-erratic and does not create significant drag. Turbulent

16:13.600 --> 16:18.960
flow is far more common but still very little is known about how to predict its behavior.

16:18.960 --> 16:24.240
It is very difficult to control because of the formation of small vortices called eddies in

16:24.240 --> 16:30.400
the flow making the flow highly erratic. Turbulent flow occurs at higher flow velocities

16:30.400 --> 16:36.880
and causes a significant increase in drag. At cruising speeds of 80 to 85 percent of the speed

16:36.880 --> 16:42.720
of sound, turbulent flow is ultimately unavoidable but we can work to minimize it.

16:43.280 --> 16:49.360
Boeing has developed a technology that helps them delay and control the formation of turbulent flow

16:49.360 --> 16:55.920
called hybrid laminar flow control. Details on their implementation of the technology are sparse.

16:55.920 --> 17:02.400
This technology is capable of reducing fuel burn by as much as 30 percent and so companies are

17:02.400 --> 17:08.240
keeping their research extremely secretive to keep their competitive advantage. Here's what we know.

17:08.240 --> 17:16.000
In the late 80s and early 90s, NASA and Boeing began investigating a suction system on the 757

17:16.000 --> 17:21.520
that would draw in boundary layer air that is the layer of very slow moving air that clings to

17:21.520 --> 17:28.080
the surface of moving objects. The outside skin was permeable to air through tiny perforations

17:28.080 --> 17:33.520
too small for the naked eye to see. Manufacturing the permeable surface while also keeping the

17:33.520 --> 17:39.280
tiny holes clear of debris is one of the many challenges with this technology. The outer and

17:39.280 --> 17:44.080
inner skin were then attached to an elaborate plumbing system that was connected to a turbo

17:44.640 --> 17:49.440
pump which sucked air from the boundary layer of air that would form along the plane's surface.

17:50.080 --> 17:55.120
By doing this they could drastically delay and reduce the size of the turbulent flow

17:55.120 --> 18:00.400
and in turn reduce the drag on the plane. There is no space for this ducting system

18:00.400 --> 18:06.800
inside the wings of the 787 but from what we do know it is inside both the horizontal and

18:06.800 --> 18:12.880
vertical tails. However the only clue of their presence are these tiny doors whose purpose

18:12.880 --> 18:18.960
are a mystery to me with little to no information available online a testament of how advanced

18:18.960 --> 18:25.120
this plane is. Composites give plenty of advantages but it does come with some disadvantages.

18:25.120 --> 18:31.760
When we examine the plane's composition one material jumps out at me. 15% of this plane

18:31.760 --> 18:38.160
is titanium that's much higher than normal. Titanium is an expensive material so they must

18:38.160 --> 18:44.240
have had a good reason to use it over aluminium. Aluminium is typically corrosion resistant when

18:44.240 --> 18:50.400
it's left on its own but when it is placed in direct contact with carbon fibre composites

18:50.400 --> 18:57.040
something strange happens. The aluminium begins to corrode incredibly quickly. Something about

18:57.040 --> 19:04.400
carbon fibre causes aluminium to oxidise and fall apart. Carbon fibre is like aluminium's kryptonite.

19:05.040 --> 19:10.480
This phenomenon is called galvanic corrosion and it happens when two materials that have

19:10.480 --> 19:17.360
dissimilar electric potentials or nobilities are placed in contact with an electrolyte like salt

19:17.360 --> 19:24.000
water. If we look at the galvanic series which quantifies materials nobilities we can see that

19:24.000 --> 19:31.200
graphite is very noble on the far end of the less scale while aluminium is quite far to the right.

19:31.200 --> 19:37.200
When this occurs an electric potential forms between the two materials that causes the two

19:37.200 --> 19:45.120
materials to trade electrons and ions which results in the anode being eaten away. This effect is made

19:45.120 --> 19:51.600
even worse when the surface of the more noble material the cathode is very large in comparison

19:51.600 --> 19:57.840
to the less noble material the anode. Say for example when carbon fibre composites are fastened

19:58.720 --> 20:05.360
using aluminium fasteners. To avoid this corrosion the engineers needed to pick a material

20:05.360 --> 20:11.520
closer to carbon in the galvanic series and the closest suitable metal was titanium.

20:11.520 --> 20:17.120
This has been a huge source of cost in manufacturing. Boeing's production cost was higher than its

20:17.120 --> 20:22.640
sales price for quite some time meaning they were making a loss on each aircraft sold.

20:23.280 --> 20:30.000
This is fairly typical for new airliners as R&D and manufacturing tooling costs take time to recoup

20:30.000 --> 20:36.480
and companies like Boeing typically spread these costs over a period of time on each plane instead

20:36.480 --> 20:43.440
of just having a massive negative balance sheet in one year. But because the 787 was so radically

20:43.440 --> 20:50.960
new these sunk development costs called deferred costs were expected to reach 25 billion before

20:50.960 --> 20:57.040
Boeing even reached a break even point on each plane sold where the cost of manufacturing

20:57.040 --> 21:05.040
equalled the sales price. In comparison the Boeing 777 reached 3.7 billion. To recoup costs as fast

21:05.040 --> 21:11.120
as possible it was essential that Boeing reduced the cost of production and high on their list

21:11.120 --> 21:17.200
was the elimination of titanium parts where possible. The frame around the cockpit windows for

21:17.200 --> 21:22.400
example were initially made out of titanium but were changed to aluminium with a special

21:22.400 --> 21:28.000
coating to prevent corrosion while some parts that were originally titanium were changed to

21:28.000 --> 21:33.600
composites like the door frames. Other improvements were sought to make the manufacturing process

21:33.600 --> 21:41.040
for titanium less costly. Many metallic parts used on aircraft start off as large blocks of metal

21:41.040 --> 21:46.960
that have to be machined down into their final shape. This results in a ton of wasted metal

21:46.960 --> 21:52.240
as the metal is gradually shaved away. Aircraft manufacturers quantify this wastage

21:52.240 --> 21:59.040
with something called a buy to fly ratio and it's a huge source of increased manufacturing costs.

21:59.040 --> 22:05.600
Cost that Boeing has tackled by collaborating with Norsk Titanium a titanium 3d printing company.

22:06.240 --> 22:13.520
Now making 3d printed metal parts is not easy. Most titanium 3d printing involves a powder

22:13.520 --> 22:19.600
titanium that is melted together using lasers. Researchers used high speed x-ray imaging to

22:19.600 --> 22:25.040
visualize what happens during this process and found a lot of imperfections. The track

22:25.040 --> 22:30.560
varies in height, the powder gets blasted away resulting in varying thickness and separated

22:30.560 --> 22:37.120
tracks and even bubbles form causing pores in the metal. This creates parts with a lot of micro

22:37.120 --> 22:43.040
imperfections and imperfections lead to decreased life as fatigue causes cracks to form.

22:43.760 --> 22:49.280
We can visualize a materials fatigue strength by plotting on an SN curve which places the

22:49.280 --> 22:55.760
magnitude of the alternating stress on the y-axis and the number of cycles it survived on the x-axis.

22:56.560 --> 23:02.000
For traditional machined titanium it looks something like this whereas for 3d printed

23:02.000 --> 23:08.640
parts it looks like this. 3d printed parts simply fail much sooner because of these tiny

23:08.640 --> 23:15.280
imperfections. Norsk has worked to improve this. Instead of using laser centering with powder

23:15.280 --> 23:22.720
Norsk have developed a revolutionizing painted wire based metallic 3d printing system for titanium

23:22.720 --> 23:29.520
that they monitor with 600 frames per second cameras for quality control. These 3d printed parts are

23:29.520 --> 23:35.920
then machined down into their final shape reducing the total titanium used by 25 to 50%

23:36.800 --> 23:42.640
and their printing method is 50 to 100 times faster than the powder printing method.

23:42.640 --> 23:49.520
This process resulted in the first ever FAA certified 3d printed structural components

23:49.520 --> 23:55.360
and they first flew in the Boeing 787. This plane is truly innovative.

23:56.000 --> 24:01.760
Titanium was not the only material Boeing worked on removing from the plane's construction to save

24:01.760 --> 24:09.120
on cost. Copper once formed an important part of the 787's wing where it was laid down in thin

24:09.120 --> 24:15.440
strips on the wing surface. This is not a typical design choice for aircraft wings and once again

24:15.440 --> 24:21.760
it was influenced by the 787's composite construction because composite materials are

24:21.760 --> 24:27.680
not good conductors. Carbon fibers are great conductors but problems arise because of the

24:27.680 --> 24:33.600
plastic resin binding them together as this resin is an insulating material preventing the

24:33.600 --> 24:39.520
passage of electricity which is a massive problem for planes as getting hit by lightning is not a

24:39.520 --> 24:45.280
rare occurrence. One study calculated that lightning strikes occurred once every 3000

24:45.280 --> 24:52.960
hours of flying between 1950 and 1975. A 787 was struck by lightning while taking off from

24:53.840 --> 25:01.600
Upon landing in India 42 to 46 holes were found in the fuselage as a result of resistive heating.

25:01.600 --> 25:07.360
The plane survived and was flown back to London for repairs with no passengers aboard but

25:07.360 --> 25:12.800
composites vulnerability to this kind of damage is a drawback and the repair process is more

25:12.800 --> 25:19.680
complicated than with aluminium. However this strike could have been much worse if the electricity

25:19.680 --> 25:25.360
does not run smoothly along the surface of the plane and exit it may cause a spark in the fuel

25:25.360 --> 25:31.600
tanks and cause an explosion. This kind of accident was not uncommon in the early days of the airline

25:31.600 --> 25:37.920
industry. Pan Am Flight 214 was struck by lightning while it flew in a holding pattern waiting for

25:37.920 --> 25:44.320
a lightning storm to pass at Philadelphia International Airport in 1967. Its left wing fuel

25:44.320 --> 25:51.040
tank exploded causing the plane to barrel out of control to the ground in flames. Since then the

25:51.040 --> 25:57.120
aviation sector has implemented rigorous safety measures and lightning protection tests to ensure

25:57.120 --> 26:03.760
an accident like this could never happen again. Early 787 wings were designed with copper strips

26:03.760 --> 26:10.000
to ensure the electrons had a path of low resistance along the surface of the wing ensuring

26:10.000 --> 26:15.600
they wouldn't travel to the fuel tank and cause a spark while also preventing resistive heating

26:15.600 --> 26:21.680
damage to the composite structure. Fasteners were sealed with an insulating material to stop electricity

26:21.680 --> 26:27.120
from traveling down the metallic fastener into the fuel tank and the fastener themselves were

26:27.120 --> 26:32.480
fitted with compression rings and a sealant to eliminate potential spark locations caused by

26:32.480 --> 26:39.760
gaps and sharp edges. Finally the 787 has a nitrogen inerting system that fills the tank with nitrogen.

26:39.840 --> 26:46.000
Ignition can't happen without oxygen. Boeing has since removed two of these protections in a cost

26:46.000 --> 26:51.920
saving measure. Removing the copper mesh and insulating caps which drew concern and criticism

26:51.920 --> 26:56.800
but Boeing argues that between the nitrogen inerting system and the other safety measures

26:56.800 --> 27:02.240
these expensive features were not needed. Where composites couldn't be used other materials were

27:02.240 --> 27:07.760
chosen. The leading edge of the wing and tail, the tail cone and parts of the engine cowling

27:07.760 --> 27:13.520
were all made from aluminium or other metals. The leading edges of the plane needed aluminium

27:13.520 --> 27:18.800
because of composites poor impact resistance. While composites have extremely high strength

27:18.800 --> 27:24.160
they can be brittle on sudden impacts such as bird strikes which most commonly happen at the

27:24.160 --> 27:30.400
leading edge of the wing or on the engines. Metals are able to deform on impact with a reduced chance

27:30.400 --> 27:36.400
of fracture instead of shattering as composites would. Aluminium leading edges were also beneficial

27:36.400 --> 27:42.960
for the purpose of deicing because it is a good thermal conductor. If you have ever flown on a

27:42.960 --> 27:49.520
very cold day you may have seen a truck spray fluid onto the wings of the plane. This is deicing fluid

27:50.080 --> 27:56.080
a heated mixture of glycol and water. It's needed because most planes aren't capable of deicing

27:56.080 --> 28:02.640
themselves on the ground. The 787 can when fed with external power because it uses a new type

28:02.640 --> 28:09.440
of deicing system. The 787 uses electrically heated blankets bonded to the surface of the slats

28:09.440 --> 28:14.400
which are able to heat the surface of the wing and melt or prevent any ice formation

28:14.400 --> 28:20.160
on the leading edge of the wing. Traditionally ice is prevented by extracting hot bleed air from

28:20.160 --> 28:26.000
the engine and piping it to vulnerable areas such as the leading edge of the wing where ice buildup

28:26.000 --> 28:32.480
could severely interfere with the wings operation. This draws valuable energy away from the engines

28:32.480 --> 28:37.920
and increases fuel consumption while also requiring a complicated network of tubing

28:37.920 --> 28:42.960
and exhausts which add weight and increases complexity of construction and maintenance.

28:43.680 --> 28:48.480
The electric heating system is twice as efficient as the extracted bleed air system

28:48.480 --> 28:54.640
as no excess energy is lost through venting air to the atmosphere and it also reduces drag

28:54.640 --> 29:01.040
as the exhaust holes for the bleed air on the lower side of the wing create drag. The 787 is

29:01.040 --> 29:06.240
actually the first commercial airliner that has eliminated this bleed air system which was a huge

29:06.240 --> 29:12.640
technical challenge and required a complete redesign of several systems and an entirely new

29:12.640 --> 29:18.800
engine. In our next video we are going to explore the incredible engineering behind the power systems

29:18.800 --> 29:25.200
of the 787 exploring the advancements in the jet engine and the overall system architecture that

29:25.200 --> 29:32.400
allowed the 787 to become the most efficient long-range airliner ever made. We will be releasing
