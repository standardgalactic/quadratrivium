12140	16420	If you were not paying attention, you may not have noticed the revolution happening
16420	21560	in the airline industry. The days of attempting to build bigger and bigger airliners like
21560	32000	the 850-passenger double-decker A380 and the 660-passenger Humt 747 are gone. The behemoths
32000	38920	are simply being outcompeted by a new generation of planes. Many mourn the slow demise of these
38920	46240	iconic planes, but you are benefiting from this change. The entire nature of air travel
46240	52280	has changed to benefit you and your needs. Your local airport has more direct flights
52280	58600	to distant lands than ever before, and the price of those tickets are cheaper than ever.
58600	64120	Connecting flights are becoming rarer and rarer as this new breed of plane takes over.
64120	71520	The plane at the forefront of this revolution? The 787 Dreamliner. A 30 billion dollar bet
71520	77760	on the future of the airline industry. Boeing sat at the poker table and pushed all their
77760	85000	chips forward. An all-in bet on a radical new future. And it paid off.
85000	91680	The 787 revolutionized not only how the airline industry operates, but how the future of planes
91680	99960	will be designed and built. This is the breakdown of the 787's materials. By weight, 55% of
99960	106600	the 787 is made from composite materials, like carbon fibre reinforced plastics, making
106600	112520	it the first commercial airliner made primarily with this new age material.
112520	123200	The 787 is rivalled only by the Airbus A350XWB introduced 4 years after the 787 in 2015. So,
123200	129480	why are composite materials so desirable for the airline industry, and how has the 787
129680	132960	made the most of their advantages?
132960	138880	Composite materials are made up of two or more materials. Take carbon reinforced plastics.
138880	145520	They are composed of extremely strong carbon fibres bound together by a plastic resin.
145520	151960	Carbon fibre, made up of thousands of tiny thin fibres of carbon, is incredibly strong
151960	157920	in tension. Up to 5 times stronger than steel, and one-fifth of its weight.
158400	165040	These tiny fibres can't create a solid part by themselves. This is an image of a human hair
165040	171600	beside a carbon fibre. The carbon fibre is the smaller one, and just like a human hair,
171600	177920	they can bend and flex and separate very easily. So, we need to first bind them together with
177920	184080	a plastic resin to form a solid material. Otherwise, they just form a strong but flexible
184080	190880	fabric. That flexibility as a fabric is exactly what makes composites so useful when creating the
190880	197280	precise and elegant curves of a plane. With the right tooling and designers, composite components
197280	203360	can be made into almost any shape imaginable. In the past, a disadvantage of making large
203360	209680	aircraft components from composites was the time taken to manually lay up parts, where layers of
209680	215920	carbon fibre and plastic resin had to be carefully constructed. It required skilled technicians,
215920	220720	and was inherently difficult to scale to the production quantities Boeing needed.
221280	227680	To get around this, Boeing uses automated tape laying to produce massive aircraft sections.
227680	234480	The 787's fuselage is created by wrapping a carbon fibre tape impregnated with a plastic resin
234480	241360	around a rotating mould of the fuselage. This machine precisely controls the overlaps of the tape
241360	248000	and the orientation of the fibres to ensure we are getting the most out of the carbon's tensile
248000	254400	strength to resist the internal pressure loads and the longitudinal bending loads the fuselage
254400	260000	will experience. One of the problems with this manufacturing method is that the part needs to
260000	265680	be placed inside an oven to cure the resin. This hardens the plastic and creates a solid
265680	272400	composite structure. Ovens the size of a wide body jet airliner fuselage are not exactly common,
272400	278320	and this is often the limiting factor on parts made this way, and requires massive upfront
278320	285360	investment to build a customised oven large enough to fit the part, but the benefits are well worth
286080	291840	The first and most obvious is the strength carbon fibre provides. Previous generation
291840	297920	airliners are typically pressurised to an equivalent of 8,000 feet. That's the same height as Mount
297920	304000	Olympus in Washington State. High enough that the lower pressure would reduce your oxygen intake
304000	310160	and your stomach will bloat as the air inside is higher pressure than the outside. This is
310160	316800	uncomfortable and exacerbates the effects of jet lag, but thanks to the 787 stronger fuselage
316800	324720	it can increase its internal air pressure to an equivalent of 6,000 feet, 25% lower in altitude
324720	331040	and about 7.3% higher in pressure. That may not sound like a lot, but it goes a long way
331040	336400	in making the journey more comfortable, and at the very least the person next to you won't be
336400	343200	farting as much. Less farting is always nice, but my favourite benefit of the stronger fuselage
343200	350800	is the absolutely massive windows. This is the 787 window, and these are windows of some equivalent
350800	358240	aluminium airliners. They are absolutely massive. In aircraft made primarily from aluminium,
358240	363760	having holes this large in metal panels would result in the build up of stress at the window
364720	370080	as the stress contours have to deviate around the window. This stress does not exceed the
370080	376400	material strength, but over repeated pressure cycles, tiny imperfections in the metal can grow
376400	382480	into even larger cracks and eventually fail. Holes this large in an aluminium airliner would
382480	388080	severely shorten the plane's flying career before it needed to be fixed or disposed of.
388160	394160	Kind of like how cracks in McGregor's leg shortened his career, but it's not a problem for the 787
394160	399360	thanks to composite's relative immunity to fatigue. You could kick Dustin Purir's kneecap
399360	405200	as many times as you like with carbon fibre shins. The carbon fibre construction provides plenty of
405200	411520	benefits for the airline operators too, because the fuselage is just one massive part. Boeing was
411520	417920	able to eliminate all joints and all the fasteners needed to join them together. The sections that
417920	425360	used to be made up of 1500 aluminium sheets riveted together using 40 to 50 000 fasteners
425360	432480	are now just one massive carbon fibre section. Carbon fibre strength to weight ratio already
432480	437920	makes the fuselage lighter, but eliminating joints and fasteners makes it even lighter again.
438480	445360	The reduced weight reduces fuel burn, but this fuselage is also incredibly aerodynamic
445360	450720	because it doesn't have thousands of little bumps and ridges all over it from those joints and
450720	456320	rivets. These surface imperfections make the plane's surface rough and cause it to disturb
456320	462800	more airflow, increasing parasitic drag. Composite materials help reduce drag in other ways too.
463440	469840	One of my favourite things about the 787 is its elegant wings. The main structural member of a
469840	475760	wing is the wingspan. Its primary role is to resist the upwards bending force during flight.
475760	482800	It's essentially just an i-beam, a shape optimised to resist bending loads. The wingspan of the 787
482800	488000	are constructed from carbon fibre composites, while the ribs, the structural members connecting
488000	493280	the two spares, and that support the wingskin are machined out of solid aluminium plates.
493840	499520	The structure, the rear and forward wingspan form with ribs running between is called
499520	506160	the wing box and it forms the main load bearing structure of the wing, while also being a literal
506160	512080	box for fuel to sit inside. The carbon fibre composite spare provides the wing fantastic
512080	517200	strength. Strength is quantified by the force required to completely fracture material,
517200	522480	but carbon fibre composites have another important quality that makes them perfect for aircraft
522480	529440	wings, their maximum elastic strain. There are two types of deformation, elastic and plastic
529440	535600	deformation. Elastic means the material will snap back into its original shape after the load is
535600	541840	removed, like an elastic band. Plastic means it will permanently deform and won't return to its
541840	548720	original shape once the load is removed, something we don't want to happen. This is permanent damage.
549440	555520	Carbon fibre composites can deform further before they strike this plastic deformation zone
555520	561840	at about 1.9%, while aircraft aluminium begins permanently deforming at less than 1%.
562960	568640	That means we can bend carbon composites further before we need to worry about permanently deforming
568640	575760	them, and that means we can make our wings super flexible. During flight, the wing tip of the 787
575840	582480	can move upwards by 3 meters. That sounds like a lot, but in order to get certified by the FAA,
582480	589920	every plane needs to be able to handle 150% of the plane's absolute maximum expected load during
589920	598480	flight for 3 seconds. And during that test, the 787's wing bent upwards by 7.6 meters. That's
598480	604800	a great deal of bending, despite carbon fibre composites being stiffer than aluminium, meaning
604800	611840	it takes more force to deform the same volume of material. But critically, 787 wings are not the
611840	617920	same shape as their aluminium counterparts. This ability to withstand greater bending allowed
617920	625200	engineers to make the 787's wings with a much higher aspect ratio. Aspect ratio is the ratio
625200	631840	between the wingspan and the mean cord, or wing width. A high aspect ratio would be a long skinny
631840	638080	wing like a glider, while a low aspect ratio would be a delta wing of a fighter jet. A traditional
638080	645760	airliner has an aspect ratio of about 9, like the 787's predecessor, the 777, but the 787
645760	653440	has a massive aspect ratio at 11. This is what causes the 787's wings to flex so much during
653440	659040	flight. Composites are actually stiffer than aluminium, but their ability to withstand
659120	666240	high deformation allowed the engineers at Boeing to create a much higher aspect ratio wing, a longer,
666240	672960	narrower wing that would bend more. But this comes with some huge benefits. The planes with the
672960	680480	highest aspect ratio are gliders. For an unpowered plane, the highest priority is minimizing energy
680480	686560	lost to drag. This allows the glider to stay in the air for extended periods with no engine.
686560	692160	These types of aircraft typically have aspect ratios greater than 30, and these aircraft have
692160	698480	the lowest drag penalties as a result of vortex drag. This is the drag caused by air mixing from
698480	703760	the high pressure zone under the wing with low pressure air above the wing, forming vortices
703760	710000	at the wing tip. By spreading the area of the wing over a longer span, we minimize the pressure that
710000	716240	drives this mixing at the wing tip, and thus minimize the energy lost to the vortices.
716240	722320	Normally, higher aspect ratio wings have lower internal volumes. For an unpowered glider,
722320	728720	this isn't an issue. But for a plane that needs that storage space for fuel, it is. Less storage
728720	735520	volume for fuel means lower range, and one of the primary goals of the 787 is to be an efficient,
735520	742160	long-range aircraft capable of allowing airliners to open new routes that were once deemed impossible.
742800	749600	Thankfully, modern planes like the 787 use a new kind of aerofoil, the supercritical aerofoil.
749600	754960	Older aerofoils look something like this, a reasonably symmetric design with a sharp nose,
754960	760240	and gentle curves on the upper and lower surface, and this is a supercritical wing.
760800	765760	The leading edge is blunter with a larger radius, the top is relatively flat,
765760	771600	and the lower portion has this strange cusp at the back. This aerofoil has much more useful
771600	777200	internal volume thanks to its blunt leading edge and larger thickness-to-cord ratio.
777760	783440	Helping solve our low internal volume problem associated with high aspect ratio wings,
784000	790160	the supercritical wing was first tested by NASA on a modified TF-8A crusader,
790160	795360	and you can really see the similarities in design ethos between the experimental plane's
795360	803520	sleek wings with the 787. But increased internal volume is not why NASA developed the supercritical
803520	809600	wing. NASA developed it to delay the onset of shockwave formation over the wings.
810560	816240	When air travels over a wing, the air on top accelerates. This means that even though the
816240	822320	plane itself might be travelling below the speed of sound, the air over the wing may break it and
822320	829040	create a shockwave. This shockwave decreases lift and causes an increase in drag. This kind of drag
829040	835280	is called wave drag, and planes need to fly below the speed this occurs at. The speed is called the
835360	841680	critical Mach number. The supercritical wing was designed to increase the critical Mach number.
841680	847680	The flat top of the supercritical wing means the air does not accelerate as much as it would over
847680	854080	a classic aerofoil. Of course, this causes a loss in lift because that fast-moving air is
854080	860160	causing a drop in pressure on top of the wing. To compensate, supercritical aerofoils have this
860240	866480	concave curvature underneath the wing, which causes an increase of pressure there to compensate.
866480	871760	This increase in pressure does not affect the critical Mach number, while the larger radius
871760	878000	of the leading edge increases the lift generated at higher angles of attack. This is because air
878000	883920	struggles to follow the tighter turns of a smaller radius leading edge, which causes earlier flow
883920	890560	detachment and stall. The larger radius delays this flow separation. This aerofoil shape changes
890560	896480	continually as you travel the length of the wing, twisting and curving in computer-calculated
896480	902400	precision, optimizing the wing shape to be as efficient as possible, and composites provided
902400	908000	the engineers with the confidence that these shapes could be manufactured. The skin is simply
908000	914080	laid down on a mold with automated tape-laying once again. We don't have to beat metal into shape
914080	920400	each and every time we want to recreate these delicate curves. The fibers of the wing have
920400	926240	even been laid in specific patterns to tailor the stiffness of the wing in different areas.
926240	933120	This means the wing deforms exactly as the 787's engineers wanted to as it gains speed.
933120	938800	So the wing shape actually changes during flight to better suit the needs at different speeds.
939360	945520	This is called aeroelastic tailoring and is the forefront of state-of-the-art aeronautical
945520	952800	engineering today. The 787 also features a novel device designed to reduce turbulent flow over
952800	959840	the tail of the aircraft. Two types of flow states exist in aerodynamics. Laminar flow occurs at low
959840	966400	velocities and is characterized by fluid layers flowing smoothly over each other in neat orderly
966400	973600	layers. Laminar flow is predictable and non-erratic and does not create significant drag. Turbulent
973600	978960	flow is far more common but still very little is known about how to predict its behavior.
978960	984240	It is very difficult to control because of the formation of small vortices called eddies in
984240	990400	the flow making the flow highly erratic. Turbulent flow occurs at higher flow velocities
990400	996880	and causes a significant increase in drag. At cruising speeds of 80 to 85 percent of the speed
996880	1002720	of sound, turbulent flow is ultimately unavoidable but we can work to minimize it.
1003280	1009360	Boeing has developed a technology that helps them delay and control the formation of turbulent flow
1009360	1015920	called hybrid laminar flow control. Details on their implementation of the technology are sparse.
1015920	1022400	This technology is capable of reducing fuel burn by as much as 30 percent and so companies are
1022400	1028240	keeping their research extremely secretive to keep their competitive advantage. Here's what we know.
1028240	1036000	In the late 80s and early 90s, NASA and Boeing began investigating a suction system on the 757
1036000	1041520	that would draw in boundary layer air that is the layer of very slow moving air that clings to
1041520	1048080	the surface of moving objects. The outside skin was permeable to air through tiny perforations
1048080	1053520	too small for the naked eye to see. Manufacturing the permeable surface while also keeping the
1053520	1059280	tiny holes clear of debris is one of the many challenges with this technology. The outer and
1059280	1064080	inner skin were then attached to an elaborate plumbing system that was connected to a turbo
1064640	1069440	pump which sucked air from the boundary layer of air that would form along the plane's surface.
1070080	1075120	By doing this they could drastically delay and reduce the size of the turbulent flow
1075120	1080400	and in turn reduce the drag on the plane. There is no space for this ducting system
1080400	1086800	inside the wings of the 787 but from what we do know it is inside both the horizontal and
1086800	1092880	vertical tails. However the only clue of their presence are these tiny doors whose purpose
1092880	1098960	are a mystery to me with little to no information available online a testament of how advanced
1098960	1105120	this plane is. Composites give plenty of advantages but it does come with some disadvantages.
1105120	1111760	When we examine the plane's composition one material jumps out at me. 15% of this plane
1111760	1118160	is titanium that's much higher than normal. Titanium is an expensive material so they must
1118160	1124240	have had a good reason to use it over aluminium. Aluminium is typically corrosion resistant when
1124240	1130400	it's left on its own but when it is placed in direct contact with carbon fibre composites
1130400	1137040	something strange happens. The aluminium begins to corrode incredibly quickly. Something about
1137040	1144400	carbon fibre causes aluminium to oxidise and fall apart. Carbon fibre is like aluminium's kryptonite.
1145040	1150480	This phenomenon is called galvanic corrosion and it happens when two materials that have
1150480	1157360	dissimilar electric potentials or nobilities are placed in contact with an electrolyte like salt
1157360	1164000	water. If we look at the galvanic series which quantifies materials nobilities we can see that
1164000	1171200	graphite is very noble on the far end of the less scale while aluminium is quite far to the right.
1171200	1177200	When this occurs an electric potential forms between the two materials that causes the two
1177200	1185120	materials to trade electrons and ions which results in the anode being eaten away. This effect is made
1185120	1191600	even worse when the surface of the more noble material the cathode is very large in comparison
1191600	1197840	to the less noble material the anode. Say for example when carbon fibre composites are fastened
1198720	1205360	using aluminium fasteners. To avoid this corrosion the engineers needed to pick a material
1205360	1211520	closer to carbon in the galvanic series and the closest suitable metal was titanium.
1211520	1217120	This has been a huge source of cost in manufacturing. Boeing's production cost was higher than its
1217120	1222640	sales price for quite some time meaning they were making a loss on each aircraft sold.
1223280	1230000	This is fairly typical for new airliners as R&D and manufacturing tooling costs take time to recoup
1230000	1236480	and companies like Boeing typically spread these costs over a period of time on each plane instead
1236480	1243440	of just having a massive negative balance sheet in one year. But because the 787 was so radically
1243440	1250960	new these sunk development costs called deferred costs were expected to reach 25 billion before
1250960	1257040	Boeing even reached a break even point on each plane sold where the cost of manufacturing
1257040	1265040	equalled the sales price. In comparison the Boeing 777 reached 3.7 billion. To recoup costs as fast
1265040	1271120	as possible it was essential that Boeing reduced the cost of production and high on their list
1271120	1277200	was the elimination of titanium parts where possible. The frame around the cockpit windows for
1277200	1282400	example were initially made out of titanium but were changed to aluminium with a special
1282400	1288000	coating to prevent corrosion while some parts that were originally titanium were changed to
1288000	1293600	composites like the door frames. Other improvements were sought to make the manufacturing process
1293600	1301040	for titanium less costly. Many metallic parts used on aircraft start off as large blocks of metal
1301040	1306960	that have to be machined down into their final shape. This results in a ton of wasted metal
1306960	1312240	as the metal is gradually shaved away. Aircraft manufacturers quantify this wastage
1312240	1319040	with something called a buy to fly ratio and it's a huge source of increased manufacturing costs.
1319040	1325600	Cost that Boeing has tackled by collaborating with Norsk Titanium a titanium 3d printing company.
1326240	1333520	Now making 3d printed metal parts is not easy. Most titanium 3d printing involves a powder
1333520	1339600	titanium that is melted together using lasers. Researchers used high speed x-ray imaging to
1339600	1345040	visualize what happens during this process and found a lot of imperfections. The track
1345040	1350560	varies in height, the powder gets blasted away resulting in varying thickness and separated
1350560	1357120	tracks and even bubbles form causing pores in the metal. This creates parts with a lot of micro
1357120	1363040	imperfections and imperfections lead to decreased life as fatigue causes cracks to form.
1363760	1369280	We can visualize a materials fatigue strength by plotting on an SN curve which places the
1369280	1375760	magnitude of the alternating stress on the y-axis and the number of cycles it survived on the x-axis.
1376560	1382000	For traditional machined titanium it looks something like this whereas for 3d printed
1382000	1388640	parts it looks like this. 3d printed parts simply fail much sooner because of these tiny
1388640	1395280	imperfections. Norsk has worked to improve this. Instead of using laser centering with powder
1395280	1402720	Norsk have developed a revolutionizing painted wire based metallic 3d printing system for titanium
1402720	1409520	that they monitor with 600 frames per second cameras for quality control. These 3d printed parts are
1409520	1415920	then machined down into their final shape reducing the total titanium used by 25 to 50%
1416800	1422640	and their printing method is 50 to 100 times faster than the powder printing method.
1422640	1429520	This process resulted in the first ever FAA certified 3d printed structural components
1429520	1435360	and they first flew in the Boeing 787. This plane is truly innovative.
1436000	1441760	Titanium was not the only material Boeing worked on removing from the plane's construction to save
1441760	1449120	on cost. Copper once formed an important part of the 787's wing where it was laid down in thin
1449120	1455440	strips on the wing surface. This is not a typical design choice for aircraft wings and once again
1455440	1461760	it was influenced by the 787's composite construction because composite materials are
1461760	1467680	not good conductors. Carbon fibers are great conductors but problems arise because of the
1467680	1473600	plastic resin binding them together as this resin is an insulating material preventing the
1473600	1479520	passage of electricity which is a massive problem for planes as getting hit by lightning is not a
1479520	1485280	rare occurrence. One study calculated that lightning strikes occurred once every 3000
1485280	1492960	hours of flying between 1950 and 1975. A 787 was struck by lightning while taking off from
1493840	1501600	Upon landing in India 42 to 46 holes were found in the fuselage as a result of resistive heating.
1501600	1507360	The plane survived and was flown back to London for repairs with no passengers aboard but
1507360	1512800	composites vulnerability to this kind of damage is a drawback and the repair process is more
1512800	1519680	complicated than with aluminium. However this strike could have been much worse if the electricity
1519680	1525360	does not run smoothly along the surface of the plane and exit it may cause a spark in the fuel
1525360	1531600	tanks and cause an explosion. This kind of accident was not uncommon in the early days of the airline
1531600	1537920	industry. Pan Am Flight 214 was struck by lightning while it flew in a holding pattern waiting for
1537920	1544320	a lightning storm to pass at Philadelphia International Airport in 1967. Its left wing fuel
1544320	1551040	tank exploded causing the plane to barrel out of control to the ground in flames. Since then the
1551040	1557120	aviation sector has implemented rigorous safety measures and lightning protection tests to ensure
1557120	1563760	an accident like this could never happen again. Early 787 wings were designed with copper strips
1563760	1570000	to ensure the electrons had a path of low resistance along the surface of the wing ensuring
1570000	1575600	they wouldn't travel to the fuel tank and cause a spark while also preventing resistive heating
1575600	1581680	damage to the composite structure. Fasteners were sealed with an insulating material to stop electricity
1581680	1587120	from traveling down the metallic fastener into the fuel tank and the fastener themselves were
1587120	1592480	fitted with compression rings and a sealant to eliminate potential spark locations caused by
1592480	1599760	gaps and sharp edges. Finally the 787 has a nitrogen inerting system that fills the tank with nitrogen.
1599840	1606000	Ignition can't happen without oxygen. Boeing has since removed two of these protections in a cost
1606000	1611920	saving measure. Removing the copper mesh and insulating caps which drew concern and criticism
1611920	1616800	but Boeing argues that between the nitrogen inerting system and the other safety measures
1616800	1622240	these expensive features were not needed. Where composites couldn't be used other materials were
1622240	1627760	chosen. The leading edge of the wing and tail, the tail cone and parts of the engine cowling
1627760	1633520	were all made from aluminium or other metals. The leading edges of the plane needed aluminium
1633520	1638800	because of composites poor impact resistance. While composites have extremely high strength
1638800	1644160	they can be brittle on sudden impacts such as bird strikes which most commonly happen at the
1644160	1650400	leading edge of the wing or on the engines. Metals are able to deform on impact with a reduced chance
1650400	1656400	of fracture instead of shattering as composites would. Aluminium leading edges were also beneficial
1656400	1662960	for the purpose of deicing because it is a good thermal conductor. If you have ever flown on a
1662960	1669520	very cold day you may have seen a truck spray fluid onto the wings of the plane. This is deicing fluid
1670080	1676080	a heated mixture of glycol and water. It's needed because most planes aren't capable of deicing
1676080	1682640	themselves on the ground. The 787 can when fed with external power because it uses a new type
1682640	1689440	of deicing system. The 787 uses electrically heated blankets bonded to the surface of the slats
1689440	1694400	which are able to heat the surface of the wing and melt or prevent any ice formation
1694400	1700160	on the leading edge of the wing. Traditionally ice is prevented by extracting hot bleed air from
1700160	1706000	the engine and piping it to vulnerable areas such as the leading edge of the wing where ice buildup
1706000	1712480	could severely interfere with the wings operation. This draws valuable energy away from the engines
1712480	1717920	and increases fuel consumption while also requiring a complicated network of tubing
1717920	1722960	and exhausts which add weight and increases complexity of construction and maintenance.
1723680	1728480	The electric heating system is twice as efficient as the extracted bleed air system
1728480	1734640	as no excess energy is lost through venting air to the atmosphere and it also reduces drag
1734640	1741040	as the exhaust holes for the bleed air on the lower side of the wing create drag. The 787 is
1741040	1746240	actually the first commercial airliner that has eliminated this bleed air system which was a huge
1746240	1752640	technical challenge and required a complete redesign of several systems and an entirely new
1752640	1758800	engine. In our next video we are going to explore the incredible engineering behind the power systems
1758800	1765200	of the 787 exploring the advancements in the jet engine and the overall system architecture that
1765200	1772400	allowed the 787 to become the most efficient long-range airliner ever made. We will be releasing
1772400	1779920	that video here on youtube shortly but if you don't want to wait it's already on nebula ad-free or
