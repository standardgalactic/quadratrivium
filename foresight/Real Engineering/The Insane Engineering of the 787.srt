00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,420
If you were not paying attention, you may not have noticed the revolution happening

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:21,560
in the airline industry. The days of attempting to build bigger and bigger airliners like

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:32,000
the 850-passenger double-decker A380 and the 660-passenger Humt 747 are gone. The behemoths

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,920
are simply being outcompeted by a new generation of planes. Many mourn the slow demise of these

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:46,240
iconic planes, but you are benefiting from this change. The entire nature of air travel

8
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:52,280
has changed to benefit you and your needs. Your local airport has more direct flights

9
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,600
to distant lands than ever before, and the price of those tickets are cheaper than ever.

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,120
Connecting flights are becoming rarer and rarer as this new breed of plane takes over.

11
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:11,520
The plane at the forefront of this revolution? The 787 Dreamliner. A 30 billion dollar bet

12
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,760
on the future of the airline industry. Boeing sat at the poker table and pushed all their

13
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:25,000
chips forward. An all-in bet on a radical new future. And it paid off.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,680
The 787 revolutionized not only how the airline industry operates, but how the future of planes

15
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:39,960
will be designed and built. This is the breakdown of the 787's materials. By weight, 55% of

16
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,600
the 787 is made from composite materials, like carbon fibre reinforced plastics, making

17
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,520
it the first commercial airliner made primarily with this new age material.

18
00:01:52,520 --> 00:02:03,200
The 787 is rivalled only by the Airbus A350XWB introduced 4 years after the 787 in 2015. So,

19
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,480
why are composite materials so desirable for the airline industry, and how has the 787

20
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,960
made the most of their advantages?

21
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,880
Composite materials are made up of two or more materials. Take carbon reinforced plastics.

22
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:25,520
They are composed of extremely strong carbon fibres bound together by a plastic resin.

23
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,960
Carbon fibre, made up of thousands of tiny thin fibres of carbon, is incredibly strong

24
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,920
in tension. Up to 5 times stronger than steel, and one-fifth of its weight.

25
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,040
These tiny fibres can't create a solid part by themselves. This is an image of a human hair

26
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,600
beside a carbon fibre. The carbon fibre is the smaller one, and just like a human hair,

27
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,920
they can bend and flex and separate very easily. So, we need to first bind them together with

28
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,080
a plastic resin to form a solid material. Otherwise, they just form a strong but flexible

29
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,880
fabric. That flexibility as a fabric is exactly what makes composites so useful when creating the

30
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:17,280
precise and elegant curves of a plane. With the right tooling and designers, composite components

31
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,360
can be made into almost any shape imaginable. In the past, a disadvantage of making large

32
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,680
aircraft components from composites was the time taken to manually lay up parts, where layers of

33
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,920
carbon fibre and plastic resin had to be carefully constructed. It required skilled technicians,

34
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,720
and was inherently difficult to scale to the production quantities Boeing needed.

35
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,680
To get around this, Boeing uses automated tape laying to produce massive aircraft sections.

36
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,480
The 787's fuselage is created by wrapping a carbon fibre tape impregnated with a plastic resin

37
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,360
around a rotating mould of the fuselage. This machine precisely controls the overlaps of the tape

38
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:08,000
and the orientation of the fibres to ensure we are getting the most out of the carbon's tensile

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,400
strength to resist the internal pressure loads and the longitudinal bending loads the fuselage

40
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,000
will experience. One of the problems with this manufacturing method is that the part needs to

41
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,680
be placed inside an oven to cure the resin. This hardens the plastic and creates a solid

42
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,400
composite structure. Ovens the size of a wide body jet airliner fuselage are not exactly common,

43
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,320
and this is often the limiting factor on parts made this way, and requires massive upfront

44
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:45,360
investment to build a customised oven large enough to fit the part, but the benefits are well worth

45
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,840
The first and most obvious is the strength carbon fibre provides. Previous generation

46
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,920
airliners are typically pressurised to an equivalent of 8,000 feet. That's the same height as Mount

47
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:04,000
Olympus in Washington State. High enough that the lower pressure would reduce your oxygen intake

48
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,160
and your stomach will bloat as the air inside is higher pressure than the outside. This is

49
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,800
uncomfortable and exacerbates the effects of jet lag, but thanks to the 787 stronger fuselage

50
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:24,720
it can increase its internal air pressure to an equivalent of 6,000 feet, 25% lower in altitude

51
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,040
and about 7.3% higher in pressure. That may not sound like a lot, but it goes a long way

52
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,400
in making the journey more comfortable, and at the very least the person next to you won't be

53
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:43,200
farting as much. Less farting is always nice, but my favourite benefit of the stronger fuselage

54
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:50,800
is the absolutely massive windows. This is the 787 window, and these are windows of some equivalent

55
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:58,240
aluminium airliners. They are absolutely massive. In aircraft made primarily from aluminium,

56
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,760
having holes this large in metal panels would result in the build up of stress at the window

57
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,080
as the stress contours have to deviate around the window. This stress does not exceed the

58
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,400
material strength, but over repeated pressure cycles, tiny imperfections in the metal can grow

59
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,480
into even larger cracks and eventually fail. Holes this large in an aluminium airliner would

60
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:28,080
severely shorten the plane's flying career before it needed to be fixed or disposed of.

61
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,160
Kind of like how cracks in McGregor's leg shortened his career, but it's not a problem for the 787

62
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,360
thanks to composite's relative immunity to fatigue. You could kick Dustin Purir's kneecap

63
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,200
as many times as you like with carbon fibre shins. The carbon fibre construction provides plenty of

64
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:51,520
benefits for the airline operators too, because the fuselage is just one massive part. Boeing was

65
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,920
able to eliminate all joints and all the fasteners needed to join them together. The sections that

66
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:05,360
used to be made up of 1500 aluminium sheets riveted together using 40 to 50 000 fasteners

67
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:12,480
are now just one massive carbon fibre section. Carbon fibre strength to weight ratio already

68
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,920
makes the fuselage lighter, but eliminating joints and fasteners makes it even lighter again.

69
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:25,360
The reduced weight reduces fuel burn, but this fuselage is also incredibly aerodynamic

70
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,720
because it doesn't have thousands of little bumps and ridges all over it from those joints and

71
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,320
rivets. These surface imperfections make the plane's surface rough and cause it to disturb

72
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:42,800
more airflow, increasing parasitic drag. Composite materials help reduce drag in other ways too.

73
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,840
One of my favourite things about the 787 is its elegant wings. The main structural member of a

74
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,760
wing is the wingspan. Its primary role is to resist the upwards bending force during flight.

75
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:02,800
It's essentially just an i-beam, a shape optimised to resist bending loads. The wingspan of the 787

76
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,000
are constructed from carbon fibre composites, while the ribs, the structural members connecting

77
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,280
the two spares, and that support the wingskin are machined out of solid aluminium plates.

78
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,520
The structure, the rear and forward wingspan form with ribs running between is called

79
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:26,160
the wing box and it forms the main load bearing structure of the wing, while also being a literal

80
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:32,080
box for fuel to sit inside. The carbon fibre composite spare provides the wing fantastic

81
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,200
strength. Strength is quantified by the force required to completely fracture material,

82
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,480
but carbon fibre composites have another important quality that makes them perfect for aircraft

83
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:49,440
wings, their maximum elastic strain. There are two types of deformation, elastic and plastic

84
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,600
deformation. Elastic means the material will snap back into its original shape after the load is

85
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,840
removed, like an elastic band. Plastic means it will permanently deform and won't return to its

86
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:08,720
original shape once the load is removed, something we don't want to happen. This is permanent damage.

87
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,520
Carbon fibre composites can deform further before they strike this plastic deformation zone

88
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:21,840
at about 1.9%, while aircraft aluminium begins permanently deforming at less than 1%.

89
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,640
That means we can bend carbon composites further before we need to worry about permanently deforming

90
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:35,760
them, and that means we can make our wings super flexible. During flight, the wing tip of the 787

91
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:42,480
can move upwards by 3 meters. That sounds like a lot, but in order to get certified by the FAA,

92
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:49,920
every plane needs to be able to handle 150% of the plane's absolute maximum expected load during

93
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:58,480
flight for 3 seconds. And during that test, the 787's wing bent upwards by 7.6 meters. That's

94
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,800
a great deal of bending, despite carbon fibre composites being stiffer than aluminium, meaning

95
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,840
it takes more force to deform the same volume of material. But critically, 787 wings are not the

96
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:17,920
same shape as their aluminium counterparts. This ability to withstand greater bending allowed

97
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:25,200
engineers to make the 787's wings with a much higher aspect ratio. Aspect ratio is the ratio

98
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:31,840
between the wingspan and the mean cord, or wing width. A high aspect ratio would be a long skinny

99
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:38,080
wing like a glider, while a low aspect ratio would be a delta wing of a fighter jet. A traditional

100
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:45,760
airliner has an aspect ratio of about 9, like the 787's predecessor, the 777, but the 787

101
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:53,440
has a massive aspect ratio at 11. This is what causes the 787's wings to flex so much during

102
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,040
flight. Composites are actually stiffer than aluminium, but their ability to withstand

103
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:06,240
high deformation allowed the engineers at Boeing to create a much higher aspect ratio wing, a longer,

104
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,960
narrower wing that would bend more. But this comes with some huge benefits. The planes with the

105
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:20,480
highest aspect ratio are gliders. For an unpowered plane, the highest priority is minimizing energy

106
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,560
lost to drag. This allows the glider to stay in the air for extended periods with no engine.

107
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,160
These types of aircraft typically have aspect ratios greater than 30, and these aircraft have

108
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,480
the lowest drag penalties as a result of vortex drag. This is the drag caused by air mixing from

109
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,760
the high pressure zone under the wing with low pressure air above the wing, forming vortices

110
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,000
at the wing tip. By spreading the area of the wing over a longer span, we minimize the pressure that

111
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,240
drives this mixing at the wing tip, and thus minimize the energy lost to the vortices.

112
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,320
Normally, higher aspect ratio wings have lower internal volumes. For an unpowered glider,

113
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,720
this isn't an issue. But for a plane that needs that storage space for fuel, it is. Less storage

114
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,520
volume for fuel means lower range, and one of the primary goals of the 787 is to be an efficient,

115
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:22,160
long-range aircraft capable of allowing airliners to open new routes that were once deemed impossible.

116
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:29,600
Thankfully, modern planes like the 787 use a new kind of aerofoil, the supercritical aerofoil.

117
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,960
Older aerofoils look something like this, a reasonably symmetric design with a sharp nose,

118
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,240
and gentle curves on the upper and lower surface, and this is a supercritical wing.

119
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,760
The leading edge is blunter with a larger radius, the top is relatively flat,

120
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:51,600
and the lower portion has this strange cusp at the back. This aerofoil has much more useful

121
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,200
internal volume thanks to its blunt leading edge and larger thickness-to-cord ratio.

122
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,440
Helping solve our low internal volume problem associated with high aspect ratio wings,

123
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,160
the supercritical wing was first tested by NASA on a modified TF-8A crusader,

124
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,360
and you can really see the similarities in design ethos between the experimental plane's

125
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:23,520
sleek wings with the 787. But increased internal volume is not why NASA developed the supercritical

126
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:29,600
wing. NASA developed it to delay the onset of shockwave formation over the wings.

127
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,240
When air travels over a wing, the air on top accelerates. This means that even though the

128
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,320
plane itself might be travelling below the speed of sound, the air over the wing may break it and

129
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:49,040
create a shockwave. This shockwave decreases lift and causes an increase in drag. This kind of drag

130
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:55,280
is called wave drag, and planes need to fly below the speed this occurs at. The speed is called the

131
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,680
critical Mach number. The supercritical wing was designed to increase the critical Mach number.

132
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,680
The flat top of the supercritical wing means the air does not accelerate as much as it would over

133
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:14,080
a classic aerofoil. Of course, this causes a loss in lift because that fast-moving air is

134
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:20,160
causing a drop in pressure on top of the wing. To compensate, supercritical aerofoils have this

135
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,480
concave curvature underneath the wing, which causes an increase of pressure there to compensate.

136
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,760
This increase in pressure does not affect the critical Mach number, while the larger radius

137
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:38,000
of the leading edge increases the lift generated at higher angles of attack. This is because air

138
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,920
struggles to follow the tighter turns of a smaller radius leading edge, which causes earlier flow

139
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:50,560
detachment and stall. The larger radius delays this flow separation. This aerofoil shape changes

140
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:56,480
continually as you travel the length of the wing, twisting and curving in computer-calculated

141
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,400
precision, optimizing the wing shape to be as efficient as possible, and composites provided

142
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:08,000
the engineers with the confidence that these shapes could be manufactured. The skin is simply

143
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,080
laid down on a mold with automated tape-laying once again. We don't have to beat metal into shape

144
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:20,400
each and every time we want to recreate these delicate curves. The fibers of the wing have

145
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:26,240
even been laid in specific patterns to tailor the stiffness of the wing in different areas.

146
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:33,120
This means the wing deforms exactly as the 787's engineers wanted to as it gains speed.

147
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,800
So the wing shape actually changes during flight to better suit the needs at different speeds.

148
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,520
This is called aeroelastic tailoring and is the forefront of state-of-the-art aeronautical

149
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:52,800
engineering today. The 787 also features a novel device designed to reduce turbulent flow over

150
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:59,840
the tail of the aircraft. Two types of flow states exist in aerodynamics. Laminar flow occurs at low

151
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:06,400
velocities and is characterized by fluid layers flowing smoothly over each other in neat orderly

152
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:13,600
layers. Laminar flow is predictable and non-erratic and does not create significant drag. Turbulent

153
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,960
flow is far more common but still very little is known about how to predict its behavior.

154
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:24,240
It is very difficult to control because of the formation of small vortices called eddies in

155
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,400
the flow making the flow highly erratic. Turbulent flow occurs at higher flow velocities

156
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:36,880
and causes a significant increase in drag. At cruising speeds of 80 to 85 percent of the speed

157
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,720
of sound, turbulent flow is ultimately unavoidable but we can work to minimize it.

158
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:49,360
Boeing has developed a technology that helps them delay and control the formation of turbulent flow

159
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,920
called hybrid laminar flow control. Details on their implementation of the technology are sparse.

160
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:02,400
This technology is capable of reducing fuel burn by as much as 30 percent and so companies are

161
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:08,240
keeping their research extremely secretive to keep their competitive advantage. Here's what we know.

162
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:16,000
In the late 80s and early 90s, NASA and Boeing began investigating a suction system on the 757

163
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,520
that would draw in boundary layer air that is the layer of very slow moving air that clings to

164
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:28,080
the surface of moving objects. The outside skin was permeable to air through tiny perforations

165
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:33,520
too small for the naked eye to see. Manufacturing the permeable surface while also keeping the

166
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,280
tiny holes clear of debris is one of the many challenges with this technology. The outer and

167
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,080
inner skin were then attached to an elaborate plumbing system that was connected to a turbo

168
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,440
pump which sucked air from the boundary layer of air that would form along the plane's surface.

169
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,120
By doing this they could drastically delay and reduce the size of the turbulent flow

170
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,400
and in turn reduce the drag on the plane. There is no space for this ducting system

171
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,800
inside the wings of the 787 but from what we do know it is inside both the horizontal and

172
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:12,880
vertical tails. However the only clue of their presence are these tiny doors whose purpose

173
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,960
are a mystery to me with little to no information available online a testament of how advanced

174
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:25,120
this plane is. Composites give plenty of advantages but it does come with some disadvantages.

175
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:31,760
When we examine the plane's composition one material jumps out at me. 15% of this plane

176
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:38,160
is titanium that's much higher than normal. Titanium is an expensive material so they must

177
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,240
have had a good reason to use it over aluminium. Aluminium is typically corrosion resistant when

178
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,400
it's left on its own but when it is placed in direct contact with carbon fibre composites

179
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:57,040
something strange happens. The aluminium begins to corrode incredibly quickly. Something about

180
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:04,400
carbon fibre causes aluminium to oxidise and fall apart. Carbon fibre is like aluminium's kryptonite.

181
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:10,480
This phenomenon is called galvanic corrosion and it happens when two materials that have

182
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:17,360
dissimilar electric potentials or nobilities are placed in contact with an electrolyte like salt

183
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:24,000
water. If we look at the galvanic series which quantifies materials nobilities we can see that

184
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,200
graphite is very noble on the far end of the less scale while aluminium is quite far to the right.

185
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,200
When this occurs an electric potential forms between the two materials that causes the two

186
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:45,120
materials to trade electrons and ions which results in the anode being eaten away. This effect is made

187
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:51,600
even worse when the surface of the more noble material the cathode is very large in comparison

188
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,840
to the less noble material the anode. Say for example when carbon fibre composites are fastened

189
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:05,360
using aluminium fasteners. To avoid this corrosion the engineers needed to pick a material

190
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,520
closer to carbon in the galvanic series and the closest suitable metal was titanium.

191
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,120
This has been a huge source of cost in manufacturing. Boeing's production cost was higher than its

192
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,640
sales price for quite some time meaning they were making a loss on each aircraft sold.

193
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:30,000
This is fairly typical for new airliners as R&D and manufacturing tooling costs take time to recoup

194
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,480
and companies like Boeing typically spread these costs over a period of time on each plane instead

195
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:43,440
of just having a massive negative balance sheet in one year. But because the 787 was so radically

196
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:50,960
new these sunk development costs called deferred costs were expected to reach 25 billion before

197
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:57,040
Boeing even reached a break even point on each plane sold where the cost of manufacturing

198
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:05,040
equalled the sales price. In comparison the Boeing 777 reached 3.7 billion. To recoup costs as fast

199
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:11,120
as possible it was essential that Boeing reduced the cost of production and high on their list

200
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,200
was the elimination of titanium parts where possible. The frame around the cockpit windows for

201
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,400
example were initially made out of titanium but were changed to aluminium with a special

202
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,000
coating to prevent corrosion while some parts that were originally titanium were changed to

203
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,600
composites like the door frames. Other improvements were sought to make the manufacturing process

204
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:41,040
for titanium less costly. Many metallic parts used on aircraft start off as large blocks of metal

205
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:46,960
that have to be machined down into their final shape. This results in a ton of wasted metal

206
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,240
as the metal is gradually shaved away. Aircraft manufacturers quantify this wastage

207
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:59,040
with something called a buy to fly ratio and it's a huge source of increased manufacturing costs.

208
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:05,600
Cost that Boeing has tackled by collaborating with Norsk Titanium a titanium 3d printing company.

209
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:13,520
Now making 3d printed metal parts is not easy. Most titanium 3d printing involves a powder

210
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:19,600
titanium that is melted together using lasers. Researchers used high speed x-ray imaging to

211
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,040
visualize what happens during this process and found a lot of imperfections. The track

212
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:30,560
varies in height, the powder gets blasted away resulting in varying thickness and separated

213
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:37,120
tracks and even bubbles form causing pores in the metal. This creates parts with a lot of micro

214
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:43,040
imperfections and imperfections lead to decreased life as fatigue causes cracks to form.

215
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,280
We can visualize a materials fatigue strength by plotting on an SN curve which places the

216
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:55,760
magnitude of the alternating stress on the y-axis and the number of cycles it survived on the x-axis.

217
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:02,000
For traditional machined titanium it looks something like this whereas for 3d printed

218
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,640
parts it looks like this. 3d printed parts simply fail much sooner because of these tiny

219
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:15,280
imperfections. Norsk has worked to improve this. Instead of using laser centering with powder

220
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:22,720
Norsk have developed a revolutionizing painted wire based metallic 3d printing system for titanium

221
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:29,520
that they monitor with 600 frames per second cameras for quality control. These 3d printed parts are

222
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:35,920
then machined down into their final shape reducing the total titanium used by 25 to 50%

223
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:42,640
and their printing method is 50 to 100 times faster than the powder printing method.

224
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:49,520
This process resulted in the first ever FAA certified 3d printed structural components

225
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:55,360
and they first flew in the Boeing 787. This plane is truly innovative.

226
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,760
Titanium was not the only material Boeing worked on removing from the plane's construction to save

227
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:09,120
on cost. Copper once formed an important part of the 787's wing where it was laid down in thin

228
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:15,440
strips on the wing surface. This is not a typical design choice for aircraft wings and once again

229
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,760
it was influenced by the 787's composite construction because composite materials are

230
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:27,680
not good conductors. Carbon fibers are great conductors but problems arise because of the

231
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:33,600
plastic resin binding them together as this resin is an insulating material preventing the

232
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,520
passage of electricity which is a massive problem for planes as getting hit by lightning is not a

233
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,280
rare occurrence. One study calculated that lightning strikes occurred once every 3000

234
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:52,960
hours of flying between 1950 and 1975. A 787 was struck by lightning while taking off from

235
00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:01,600
Upon landing in India 42 to 46 holes were found in the fuselage as a result of resistive heating.

236
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:07,360
The plane survived and was flown back to London for repairs with no passengers aboard but

237
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,800
composites vulnerability to this kind of damage is a drawback and the repair process is more

238
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:19,680
complicated than with aluminium. However this strike could have been much worse if the electricity

239
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:25,360
does not run smoothly along the surface of the plane and exit it may cause a spark in the fuel

240
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:31,600
tanks and cause an explosion. This kind of accident was not uncommon in the early days of the airline

241
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:37,920
industry. Pan Am Flight 214 was struck by lightning while it flew in a holding pattern waiting for

242
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:44,320
a lightning storm to pass at Philadelphia International Airport in 1967. Its left wing fuel

243
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:51,040
tank exploded causing the plane to barrel out of control to the ground in flames. Since then the

244
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:57,120
aviation sector has implemented rigorous safety measures and lightning protection tests to ensure

245
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:03,760
an accident like this could never happen again. Early 787 wings were designed with copper strips

246
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:10,000
to ensure the electrons had a path of low resistance along the surface of the wing ensuring

247
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,600
they wouldn't travel to the fuel tank and cause a spark while also preventing resistive heating

248
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,680
damage to the composite structure. Fasteners were sealed with an insulating material to stop electricity

249
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:27,120
from traveling down the metallic fastener into the fuel tank and the fastener themselves were

250
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,480
fitted with compression rings and a sealant to eliminate potential spark locations caused by

251
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:39,760
gaps and sharp edges. Finally the 787 has a nitrogen inerting system that fills the tank with nitrogen.

252
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:46,000
Ignition can't happen without oxygen. Boeing has since removed two of these protections in a cost

253
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,920
saving measure. Removing the copper mesh and insulating caps which drew concern and criticism

254
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,800
but Boeing argues that between the nitrogen inerting system and the other safety measures

255
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:02,240
these expensive features were not needed. Where composites couldn't be used other materials were

256
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,760
chosen. The leading edge of the wing and tail, the tail cone and parts of the engine cowling

257
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:13,520
were all made from aluminium or other metals. The leading edges of the plane needed aluminium

258
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,800
because of composites poor impact resistance. While composites have extremely high strength

259
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:24,160
they can be brittle on sudden impacts such as bird strikes which most commonly happen at the

260
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:30,400
leading edge of the wing or on the engines. Metals are able to deform on impact with a reduced chance

261
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:36,400
of fracture instead of shattering as composites would. Aluminium leading edges were also beneficial

262
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:42,960
for the purpose of deicing because it is a good thermal conductor. If you have ever flown on a

263
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:49,520
very cold day you may have seen a truck spray fluid onto the wings of the plane. This is deicing fluid

264
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:56,080
a heated mixture of glycol and water. It's needed because most planes aren't capable of deicing

265
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:02,640
themselves on the ground. The 787 can when fed with external power because it uses a new type

266
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:09,440
of deicing system. The 787 uses electrically heated blankets bonded to the surface of the slats

267
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,400
which are able to heat the surface of the wing and melt or prevent any ice formation

268
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:20,160
on the leading edge of the wing. Traditionally ice is prevented by extracting hot bleed air from

269
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:26,000
the engine and piping it to vulnerable areas such as the leading edge of the wing where ice buildup

270
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,480
could severely interfere with the wings operation. This draws valuable energy away from the engines

271
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,920
and increases fuel consumption while also requiring a complicated network of tubing

272
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,960
and exhausts which add weight and increases complexity of construction and maintenance.

273
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:48,480
The electric heating system is twice as efficient as the extracted bleed air system

274
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,640
as no excess energy is lost through venting air to the atmosphere and it also reduces drag

275
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:01,040
as the exhaust holes for the bleed air on the lower side of the wing create drag. The 787 is

276
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:06,240
actually the first commercial airliner that has eliminated this bleed air system which was a huge

277
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,640
technical challenge and required a complete redesign of several systems and an entirely new

278
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,800
engine. In our next video we are going to explore the incredible engineering behind the power systems

279
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:25,200
of the 787 exploring the advancements in the jet engine and the overall system architecture that

280
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:32,400
allowed the 787 to become the most efficient long-range airliner ever made. We will be releasing

281
