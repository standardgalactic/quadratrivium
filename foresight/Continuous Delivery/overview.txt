Processing Overview for Continuous Delivery
============================
Checking Continuous Delivery/Learning from Big Public Software Failures ｜ Kevlin Henney In The Engineering Room Ep. 6.txt
 The conversation between Dave Thomas and Kevlin Henney revolved around the importance of taking small steps in software development rather than focusing solely on raw speed. They emphasized that stability and the ability to adjust one's direction are crucial for effective progress. This approach allows developers to pay attention to their surroundings, sense their way through problems, and make informed decisions about design choices and modularity.

Kevlin used the analogy of walking instead of running to illustrate this point—walking provides more contact with the ground, which means a greater ability to react and change direction without the risk of falling and getting injured. This metaphor serves as a reminder that in software development, moving quickly can lead to exhaustion and a loss of the careful attention required for thoughtful decision-making.

The conversation also touched on the importance of feedback, continuous learning, and the human element in programming. The discussion highlighted that by going slower, developers can ultimately move faster because they have the time to consider their options and make better decisions.

Dave Thomas and Kevlin Henney both agree that the focus should be on sustainable pace, continuous improvement, and the application of best practices rather than just trying to rush through development tasks. They encourage developers to reflect on their work, learn from their experiences, and apply this knowledge to improve their processes and outcomes.

The takeaway is that software development is a marathon, not a sprint, and that taking deliberate, small steps can lead to more sustainable and successful projects in the long run.

Checking Continuous Delivery/Measuring Software Delivery With DORA Metrics.txt
1. **Throughput vs. Stability**: High throughput (fast feature delivery) without high stability (low defect density) can be unsustainable and may lead to increased technical debt and decreased software quality over time. The goal should be a balance between delivering features quickly and maintaining the health of the codebase.

2. **Short-term vs. Long-term Focus**: There's a temptation to prioritize short-term delivery goals, which can lead to cutting corners and producing lower quality work that may increase costs in the long run. It's important to consider the trade-offs between immediate benefits and sustainable, high-quality development practices.

3. **Dora Metrics**: The DORA metrics (Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes, Mean Time to Recovery, and Change Failure Rate) are valuable for measuring software delivery performance but should be used as indicators rather than targets. They provide context that can help teams understand the impact of their workflows on delivery efficiency and stability.

4. **Instrumentation Analogy**: Just like in driving a car, where speed is just one aspect of travel, DORA metrics should be correlated with other factors to fully understand performance and outcomes. The context matters; for example, high velocity may be beneficial if it's within safety limits and contributes to timely arrival at the destination.

5. **Implications for Decision Making**: When faced with deadlines, teams must evaluate whether investing time in quality now will save time and reduce costs in the future. The decision to cut corners should be made with an understanding of the immediate and long-term implications.

6. **Continuous Improvement**: Practices like continuous integration (CI), test driven development (TDD), and continuous delivery (CD) are recommended alongside DORA metrics to improve software delivery performance and maintain a healthy balance between speed and stability.

In summary, the insights from the DORA metrics provide valuable data that can help teams optimize their software delivery processes, but they should be used judiciously in conjunction with other practices and considerations for sustainable development and high-quality outcomes.

Checking Continuous Delivery/Object Oriented Programming vs Functional Programming.txt
1. **Human Cognition and Math**: Human brains are adept at catching balls rather than calculating their physics because it's more intuitive and efficient. This highlights the importance of clarity and ease of understanding in code, which is often more readable in an imperative style like Java, despite its potential complexity.

2. **Functional vs Imperative Programming**: While functional programming offers benefits such as immutability and potential for parallelism, it can sometimes sacrifice readability. The imperative example of a sum function is easier to explain to someone with no coding experience than the Haskell equivalent.

3. **Hybrid Approach**: The speaker advocates for a hybrid approach that incorporates aspects of both object-oriented (OO) and functional programming, specifically by limiting side effects in OO code.

4. **Synchronous Communication**: The speaker proposes an alternative constraint on programming: disallowing synchronous calls between modules of code. Instead, modules would communicate through asynchronous message passing with confirmations. This approach would allow for internal single-threaded execution within each module, promoting concurrency at the boundaries.

5. **Performance and Concurrency**: This proposed constraint is claimed to offer higher performance than both functional design (due to copying of data) and traditional OO systems (due to less tightly coupled code). It also aligns more closely with Alan Kay's vision for computation from the 1960s.

6. **Reactive Manifesto**: The speaker mentions a document called the "Reactive Manifesto" that discusses similar ideas, and invites viewers to comment if they are interested in learning more about these concepts in a future video.

Checking Continuous Delivery/The STUPID MYTH Of Genius Software Developers.txt
1. **Goals Matter**: The use of tools and techniques in DevOps is a means to an end, not the end itself. Good goals are either generic (like improving software stability and throughput) or highly specific to an organization's needs.

2. **Measuring Progress**: The DORA metrics (Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes, Mean Time to Recovery, and Change Failure Rate) are used to measure the success of DevOps practices in terms of stability and throughput.

3. **Autonomy of Teams**: Autonomous teams are more likely to spot and fix issues quickly because they're closer to the work. They should have the freedom to make decisions, as this is crucial for improving software quality and efficiency.

4. **Focus on Real Goals**: The ultimate goal is not to follow a process but to produce good, safe software. Teams should focus on behaviors that lead to high stability and throughput rather than being preoccupied with process steps.

5. **Small Steps Towards Improvement**: Teams should make small, incremental changes towards better software delivery. They should measure their progress using DORA metrics and other relevant performance indicators.

6. **Responsibility and Trust**: Teams need to be held responsible for their decisions and choices. If a decision leads to negative outcomes, it's the team's responsibility to correct it, fostering a culture of ownership and accountability rather than passing problems along.

7. **Process Gatekeeping**: A process that encourages throwing problems over a wall to different teams is counterproductive. It stifles creativity, collaboration, and individual responsibility.

8. **Collaborative Culture**: The goal for all involved in software development is to produce great software efficiently. This requires a collaborative culture that values creativity, iteration, autonomy, and shared responsibility.

9. **Support and Community**: For those interested in further engaging with the content and community around Continuous Delivery, joining the Patreon community and participating in the Discord discussions can provide additional support and resources.

Checking Continuous Delivery/What Software Architecture Should Look Like.txt
1. **Microservices Misconceptions**: Microservices are often over-engineered for small development teams and can lead to a distributed monolith if not properly managed. True independently deployable services allow for continuous delivery, but this is rarely the case in practice.

2. **Complexity of Software**: Software architecture should be approached with caution, acknowledging that our initial designs are likely incomplete or incorrect. It's an iterative and incremental process that evolves as we learn more.

3. **Security and Design**: Security should not be a primary concern at the outset. Instead, design your system to allow for security enhancements without disrupting existing progress.

4. **Scalability**: Don't force scalability from day one; design your system in a way that it can adapt to increased demands later on.

5. **Managing Complexity**: Insulate the parts of your system that you understand well from those that are less clear, using sketches or placeholders for the unknowns. This allows for focused development and the ability to refine the architecture over time.

6. **Flexible Architecture**: A good architecture should have few rigid constraints but guide decisions effectively. It should be flexible enough to adapt to new insights and requirements without requiring a complete redesign.

7. **Incremental Design**: Embrace an incremental approach to software design, where you start with your best guesses, identify areas of uncertainty, and continuously refine the system as you gain more knowledge.

8. **Learning from Mistakes**: Be open to change and ready to adjust your architecture when mistakes or new information arise, like in the case of Intel's performance optimization that compromised encryption.

9. **Final Advice**: When designing software architecture, aim for a balance between guiding constraints and flexibility, ensuring that the system can evolve with minimal loss when changes are necessary.
