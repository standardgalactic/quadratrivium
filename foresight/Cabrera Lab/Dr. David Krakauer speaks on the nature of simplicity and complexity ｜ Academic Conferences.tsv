0	21720	Our next speaker is quite an honor that he is here to speak to us, David Crackauer.
21720	28400	He is an evolutionary biologist and the president and William H. Miller professor of complex
28400	32400	systems at the Santa Fe Institute.
32400	37000	He also co-directs the collective computation group at the Santa Fe Institute.
37000	43200	And prior to all of that, David served as the founding director of the Wisconsin Institute
43200	48200	for Discovery, as well as the co-director of the Center for Complexity and Collective
48200	55920	Computation, and as a professor of mathematical genetics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
55920	59000	That's only part of his introduction part of his resume.
59000	64680	David has also held positions as a visiting fellow at the Genomics Frontiers Institute
64680	67040	at the University of Pennsylvania.
67040	71240	He's also been a sage fellow at the Sage Center for the Study of the Mind at the University
71240	77880	of California, Santa Barbara, a long-term fellow of the Institute for Advanced Study
77880	83880	in Princeton, and a visiting professor of evolution at Princeton University.
84840	91480	And if that wasn't enough, in 2012, he was included in the Wired Magazine smart list
91480	96080	as one of the 50 people who will change the world.
96080	97960	And he's here with us today.
97960	103280	So I am thrilled to have him join us today, and it is my absolute pleasure to introduce
103280	106080	to you all, David Crackauer.
110080	111080	Hello, everybody.
111080	112080	Morning.
112080	113080	Thank you very much.
113280	114280	Can you all hear me?
114280	115280	Great.
115280	117680	Yeah, there's sort of little introduction to it.
117680	118680	Who are they talking about?
118680	122360	Who is this person that's not me that's being introduced?
122360	130080	So I'm just going to jump right in to my slides to make sure this all works.
133080	136080	And let's see.
136080	139080	Is that all visible to you?
139080	140080	Great.
140080	147080	So I'm going to start, in some sense, anti-system, and then we're going to migrate towards system.
147080	150080	This is a quote I rather love.
150080	156080	This is a quote from Murray Gelman's 1969 Nobel acceptance speech.
156080	161080	Murray is one of the founders of the Center Institute, as some of you will know.
161080	168080	And he said, how can it be that writing down a few simple and elegant formulating like short
168080	174080	poems governed by strict rules, such as those of the sonnet or the waka, can predict universal
174080	176080	regularities of nature?
176080	181080	The waka, by the way, is the ancestor of the haiku.
181080	184080	It would be a little bit too pedestrian for Murray to say haiku.
184080	187080	So he says waka instead.
187080	194080	And this comes out of the work that Murray had done that won him the Nobel Prize on recognizing
194080	196080	fundamental symmetries in nature.
196080	203080	And he wrote down what's become famous as the so-called eightfold way, which is the symmetry
203080	207080	group of the hadrons, which are fundamental particles.
207080	213080	And it's an extraordinary achievement because you write down this, what seems like an invention
213080	219080	of the human mind, that is the Lie algebra for the special unitary group three.
219080	228080	And out of that pops a prediction of a hidden facet of reality, a subatomic particle.
228080	232080	And this is the great mystery, if you like, of applied mathematics.
232080	234080	So that's that Murray.
234080	239080	But there's another Murray that was associated with the founding of the San Dufan students, the Murray who
239080	244080	asked this question, which was, think how hard physics would be if particles could think.
244080	249080	Now this is in some sense the rallying cry for complexity science.
249080	256080	It says, instead of a world dominated by conservation laws, conservation of energy and matter and fundamental
256080	266080	symmetries, it's a world dominated by agency, self awareness, consciousness, reflexivity, system
266080	269080	to, you know, you pick your favorite phrase.
269080	276080	How do you understand those kinds of worlds where the system itself is learning and adapting,
276080	285080	responding to your observations in such a way as to stifle stymie your future efforts to predict them.
285080	293080	And that led quite naturally to this remark, which I think would resonate with everyone at this meeting, where he
293080	301080	essentially makes the point that the complexity of connections in the modern world is so dense.
301080	311080	That there's a real argument for studying some emergent system, which he calls the whole system, rather
311080	319080	than pursue that disciplinary convenience of dissecting the world into its individual components of the
319080	327080	system that Murray had worked on as a physicist. And I've often wondered what Murray meant when he said whole system.
327080	335080	That's been confusing to me. It's almost as if what Murray did is he started as a reductionist physicist, working on the
335080	341080	atoms and quarks and gluons and took some kind of long jump by helping to construct the Santa Fe
341080	346080	Institute and landing on the whole system, which is the planetary system itself.
346080	355080	And I think this is a significant challenge. And I think what Murray actually meant was looking at that point, if you like, of
355080	364080	highest elevation, where we're not studying the whole system, I think that's actually arguably impossible, but we're studying the systems of the world.
364080	370080	And I want to argue throughout this presentation that the systems of the world should be thought of as verbs, not nouns.
370080	379080	I mean, when I go to meetings, people will say we should study the energy sector, or the communication sector or the global banking system.
379080	390080	These to me are objects and artifacts, as opposed to studying processes that actually transcend any given one of those systems, if you like, and that's what I'll argue for, not
390080	399080	to say that you can't do the former, that would be perfectly reasonable and fascinating, but I'm more interested in the generalities that span them.
399080	412080	And so this will be essentially at the table of my talk in a nutshell, and we're going to dive into some of the details because I think the interest of this approach to working on systems lives in the detailed way in which we
412080	422080	analyze them. And so for example, conflict, it's obviously all of these topics I imagine are of great interest today in the world.
422080	432080	And when we understand conflict, both at the individual level, right, that is individual fights, if you like, all the way through to wars at the level of nation states.
432080	443080	Is it meaningful, for example, to describe them both as conflict, or is that just a sort of historical accident that we use the same word to describe events at different scales.
443080	453080	And I'm going to argue that the only sense in which it's meaningful is if you can find the mechanics, or the models that are constitutive of the process.
453080	463080	Right, and demonstrate that that actually yes they are because what we mean in both cases is a certain notion of criticality and I'm going to jump into that in a second.
463080	468080	Another one, culture, how does culture actually work.
468080	476080	You know where where suspended ammently in a world of beliefs and ideas. How do we acquire them, how do we transmit them.
476080	488080	And that this notion of culture is very diffuse, right, so we go from the culture of individual beliefs and norms, all the way through to, you know, enforceable legal systems.
488080	502080	And again, is that real. I mean are we correct in asserting that these are elements of culture. And I think the answer is yes, because in each case we're talking about attitudes towards imitation transmission.
502080	507080	If you like the sort of essential modules or atoms of cultural evolution and so forth.
507080	514080	Again what is constitutive of that notion of culture, and I'm going to focus there on on the evolution of constitutions.
514080	520080	And finally, revolutions, social revolution, scientific revolutions.
520080	525080	Why do some institutions emerge and then freeze.
525080	537080	And there are extraordinarily difficult to change, whereas others seem to be in flux all the time. Can we come to some fundamental understanding about why that's true.
537080	550080	And here I think the answer is yes we can we have to think about structures and orders that have multiple timescales and the way learning rules percolate through those timescales.
550080	557080	So as to either engender fixity stasis, or evolution and change.
557080	565080	So that'll be the sort of that sort of the talk, and I'm going to jump into empirical case studies with mathematical models.
565080	569080	Don't worry too much if it all looks a bit heady.
569080	578080	Just to say that I think that you do this to study says you have to do this in other words, with the essentials of the scientific method.
578080	591080	So let's start with a little data model building an experiment, and no less important here than they would be in a disciplinary pursuit. It's just that we're doing something rather differently.
591080	596080	So let's start with this conflict to contain an issue.
596080	614080	This is not criticality first this is a plot that you will have all seen if you're watching the news at any point in the last three years, which is sort of flatten the curve right so this is a series of projected epidemic profiles for of coven for example,
614080	620080	and critical exponents are zero, or are not in England.
620080	630080	This is that thing which we've all become familiar with, which is the number of secondary infections initiated by a primary infection certain that little picture on the top right.
630080	639080	You can see that if our north or zero is five, then a single initial infection will lead to five secondary infections and so on.
639080	647080	So this is that as you move the critical exponent are zero closer to one, we flatten the curve.
647080	665080	And if our zero is below one, the epidemic would peter out. So this is what's meant by contagion is propagation of infection, and it's also was meant by a critical exponent, which is this threshold value magic value, below which an infection is
665080	670080	and above which it's super critical. Okay.
670080	676080	Many people have claimed in the literature that conflict is something like a contagion.
676080	693080	It spreads from one person to another through a mechanic which is somewhat dissimilar I imagine what we know to an infectious disease, and moreover it shows critical phenomena that is that there is some threshold value of aggression.
693080	701080	Or adversarial interaction, above which conflict becomes super critical, and below which it would be so critical.
701080	708080	And the idea I guess at the Pacific dream would be to get those critical exponents below one.
708080	711080	So it's to move into subcritical regimes.
711080	715080	Is any of this true is a huge literature.
715080	720080	Well, to answer that question if you look at the data and we have to build mathematical models.
720080	726080	And answer this question of whether or not conflict really is a contagion or not.
726080	733080	So here's the kind of basic questions we might want to ask ourselves, is it true. Does it have a critical transition.
733080	742080	Is there a relationship, for example between the conflict duration the number of fatalities, the, the geographical area that it encompasses.
742080	753080	And if that's all true. What are the normative implications that is, we're not just doing descriptive natural history of conflict we want to intervene in such a way as to minimize it.
753080	762080	The way of for example a physician might make recommendations for mass wearing, so as to minimize the spread of a pandemic.
762080	766080	So that's one of the sorts of questions.
766080	770080	So, in order to answer that now.
770080	773080	I wonder if I can see you can see this.
773080	780080	Is anything blocked here by the way Laura or can you see the whole screen that my own so good.
780080	782080	We can see the whole screen. Oh great great great.
782080	791080	So, um, so the way we do this is we look at two kinds of systems. We look at experimental systems non human systems that we can intervene into.
791080	797080	And so these are small populations, every individual can be monitored.
797080	803080	And we're looking at the individual conflict rules that individuals are following. So very micro.
803080	814080	On the other hand we have large scale observational data of human populations, very macro. And in that case we're inferring quite different kinds of scaling relations not individual decision rules.
814080	820080	So, I just want to make that point about model systems versus observational systems.
820080	828080	It leads to a lot of heated debate I think one should look at both because they each have strengths and weaknesses.
828080	835080	So, let me just give you one example this is something we've been studying for many years non human primates macaques by the monkeys and so on.
835080	846080	And here, just to give you a sense we can look at any given moment in time. These are animals in captivity at who is fighting or not fighting at any given point in time so very micro.
846080	853080	We can see who interacts with whom we can reconstruct social networks of their interactions and so on.
853080	855080	And out of that kind of data.
855080	865080	So, let me give you some of those sorts of interesting insights but let me give you one example. This is the scaling of the log log axes of the conflict duration and conflict size.
865080	883080	Just notice that as the number of individuals in a particular conflict increases, so does the duration of the conflict, and it increases polynomially in increases as the square of the number of individuals.
883080	893080	The variance, not just the mean. So this is the distribution of how long peace bouts last so for example, no one's fighting anyone.
893080	907080	10 seconds 10 minutes an hour and so on, and conflict durations and you'll notice that if you look at the distribution of durations, as they get longer the variance increases, so the scatter around that distribution increases.
907080	924080	So here's just some data. What one can now do is write down a whole family don't worry about the details of mathematical models and explore the full configuration space of possible contagion processes, not just one or two but a very large number, and ask which ones of those
924080	934080	mathematical models are consistent with the scaling relationships, for example the one observed in the data, the scaling of the mean and the scaling of variance.
934080	953080	But most contagion process actually can't recover the observed data and this is quite important, because in many studies people will assert contagion without checking carefully against the empirical data, which would either refute or confirm transiently the hypothesis.
953080	975080	And what we find just is, is a critical role of agency. It is a contagion process, but with one really interesting characteristic, which is long term memory, that is, the memory of the first conflict, and its duration is felt throughout all subsequent conflicts, that is not a
976080	990080	property of a mathematical, of a biological epidemic. There's a very different kind of contagion, it's contagion with significant memory in it, which is that sort of agency fact that self awareness fact and we all know that and resentments are very long lasting.
990080	1002080	So an attempt, for example, to intervene on a human conflict contagion as if it were a biological contagion, without taking into account the sort of psychological fact of memory would fail.
1002080	1005080	So that's just one example.
1005080	1013080	We've also looked, as I said, at the more core screen data, we've looked, this is the so-called ACLED database, extraordinarily rich.
1013080	1022080	And we've been studying conflicts in continental Africa for two decades, looking at things that are very similar actually to the micro data I just showed you.
1022080	1037080	And here you don't have who's fighting whom at a given point in time, but what you do have is data like this where over the course of time you have battles, the number of fatalities, exact geographical locations and so forth.
1037080	1044080	So we can study time and space, but at a much more low resolution than we would in the experimental system.
1044080	1056080	And as with the experimental system, we can look at things like the distribution of conflict sizes, the distribution of fatalities, duration and spatial extent.
1056080	1073080	And as with micro data, we can write down mathematical models as a rather complicated model and maybe describe this one in any detail, but just the idea that contagions grow as a kind of a fractal like branching pattern on a two dimensional surface.
1073080	1089080	And one of the things that these models predict is that at critical points, like for example R zero equals one, that is that critical point below which an epidemic is subcritical above which it's supercritical.
1089080	1102080	Something really interesting happens, you get a complete collapse of complexity, and all of those scaling exponents become related. It's actually a really beautiful feature of complex systems that at critical points they become simple.
1103080	1112080	And for those who are interested in the form of analysis, this is using something called renormalization group theory. It's a way of looking across scales.
1112080	1125080	And you can see, and just take my word for it if you like, that if you look at the ratios and empirical data against the model predictions they're extraordinarily close, which suggests two things again.
1125080	1136080	And yes, this is a contagion like phenomenon so that's a correct statement, but it's also a contagion like process that's near criticality.
1136080	1139080	And this is very surprising.
1139080	1142080	Because it's not clear why that should be the case.
1142080	1146080	So if you think about an epidemic with R zero.
1147080	1163080	Why would it live by a critical point, and we all know the answer actually because we're observing it today. And that is that if are not zero I never quite know I've sort of been in the United States long enough to want to say zero but my answer my early life was in England so
1163080	1178080	not so I'm going to be at the critical point where I say both. And if you think about it, when the epidemic is in full blast, we start taking precautions. We wear masks we get vaccinated we get boosted.
1178080	1181080	We shift our zero down.
1181080	1184080	But when our zero falls below one.
1184080	1189080	The epidemic starts petering out and what happens we take off our masks.
1189080	1201080	We take off our masks because we think oh look, we've won. And then what happens the new strain emerges and it probably gets back in. We put our mask back on, and this is one of the so called roots to endomism.
1201080	1215080	And that phenomenon of a system hovering around the critical point is called self organized criticality. And it seems as if conflict is manifesting this phenomenon of hovering by a critical point.
1215080	1227080	In many cases, yes, with a strong agency memory effect. Does it have a critical transition yes but we don't know exactly where it is we don't know the r zero of human conflict.
1227080	1237080	You get this incredibly interesting simplification of the system of conflict at the critical point with all the scaling exponents become related.
1237080	1246080	And the normative implications for us are deliberative techniques to move systems away from critical points.
1246080	1256080	And that's the whole era of investigation we've pursued and perhaps we in questions we can deal with it, but if you look at my website there's some things on that there.
1256080	1261080	So that's just one example. Let's keep jumping to the culture.
1261080	1275080	How on earth should we model culture. And this is, again, my view is you have to take a representative model system where good data is available, and you could look at Twitter.
1275080	1284080	You could look at newspapers. It almost doesn't matter, as long as you're rigorous and, you know, consistent in the way you do this.
1284080	1295080	So we've been looking at constitutional history. And so this is a very famous painting is painted in 1740. It relates to the signing of the Constitution American Constitution 1789.
1295080	1301080	And you can see in that picture I'm sure a few familiar faces.
1301080	1310080	And what we do, working with constitutional historians and lawyers is we take a constitution and we atomize it.
1310080	1321080	We break it down into its essential themes. And for those interested in machine learning, or natural language analysis, these atoms are called topics.
1321080	1333080	So for example, oops, these are my questions. Let's just skip them we'll come back to them. So here's a constitution we're going to break it up into its basic lexical atoms.
1333080	1346080	The way it treats general rights, the way it treats sovereignty public order. And we're going to ask how do these themes diffuse forward in time through constitutions.
1346080	1354080	The way that constitutions are written is you don't sit down in a room and write one for your nation de novo out of nowhere.
1354080	1356080	Ex Ovo.
1356080	1361080	You look at prior constitutions and you borrow from them.
1361080	1369080	But what you can do, mathematically is reconstruct the phylogenetic tree of all constitutions that have ever been written.
1369080	1375080	And if we zoom in on this you can see, here's the Constitution of Egypt of 1923.
1375080	1381080	It was highly influential on the room D62 albania 25 it was slightly 31 year old 1925.
1381080	1385080	These are obviously a reading chronological order.
1385080	1392080	What's going on here, which topics are circulating how is borrowing taking place and why.
1392080	1397080	What's the impact of local culture and geography.
1397080	1403080	I'm going to skip all that for today, but just give you a sort of sense of what you can say in this kind of structure.
1403080	1408080	We can sort of leap in and look at the micro geometry of that tree.
1408080	1413080	What you're looking at here if you look at the center, you have the focal constitution of interest.
1413080	1425080	It has a number of parents that it borrowed from that we've inferred using some techniques, and a number of offspring that it influenced that borrowed from it.
1425080	1442080	And we can reconstruct this kind of zoo of geometries of all the constitutions all of these are essentially that structure on the left but giving you a sense of the diversity of constitutional forms that we can reconstruct going back to 1789.
1443080	1454080	And these actually correspond to particular constitutions you can look at the bottom one that's the Constitution of Montenegro had three parents no offspring.
1454080	1456080	Right.
1456080	1461080	The interesting one is the South Korean Constitution of 1948.
1461080	1471080	That's that one sort of third from the bottom. It has a small number of parents but a lot of offspring. That's a very influential constitution.
1471080	1486080	And so we can start asking, which constitutions are highly inventive which ones had disproportional impact, which ones are sterile, actually never led to offspring, and so on.
1486080	1499080	And so complicated plot, but what if you look at the lifespan of a constitution, the lifespan is defined as when it was written, and when it start it stopped being borrowed from.
1499080	1513080	And so no one looks at it anymore. The US Constitution is very interesting. It was very influential early, but it was so influential on secondary constitutions that they borrowed from those instead of the founding constitution.
1513080	1524080	And top left you see a tree of all the constitutions you see three clear epochs founding 1789 up until the Second World War.
1524080	1533080	And so you get rid of a relatively slow rate of constitution writing, and all the constitutions are very long lived.
1533080	1541080	Then during the war subsequent you get an acceleration of the production of constitutions, most of which are very short lived.
1541080	1544080	So quite distinct cultural phases.
1544080	1558080	And so we can go into this particular object, which seems to think what are constitutions they established branches of government, the separation of powers, property rights, issues about freedom of expression.
1558080	1566080	These are in some sense the operating systems of societies, and they have a very interesting dynamic.
1566080	1582080	So you can then answer these questions. How is cultural transmitted cultures transmitted a little bit like genetics. It's not genes, it's core constellations of concepts like rights property rights structures of government.
1582080	1587080	Which ideas are most influential and constitutions strong early mover advantage.
1588080	1604080	Quite unequivocally that if you're early, early in the, the writing of the constitution, you will be an influential one. It almost doesn't matter what you write about, because you become a source of influence on subsequent constitutional authors.
1604080	1613080	This is a preferential attachment dynamic that many of you will be familiar with it happens for example, Uber happened to eBay having Etsy.
1614080	1632080	Being their first and becoming the preferred markets for ideas is a long lasting effect. And it's no less true for these ancient cultural forms and it is for contemporary technological forms, even though many have claimed the dynamics of software
1632080	1643080	that is different. It actually isn't you. It seems to be a more universal dynamic of culture than a particular mechanic of the contemporary world.
1643080	1661080	And this really interesting point that it's better to be revolutionary than evolutionary if you're writing constitutions. That is, the highly inventive constitutions that that add new topics if you like new categories of thought are the ones that people look
1661080	1674080	at, not the ones that add one or two increments and what came before them so be first and be radical is the sort of if you like the message of constitutional history.
1674080	1685080	Finally, revolutions like everyone else I'm interested in revolutions, particularly scientific revolutions, but during the last few years social revolutions.
1685080	1691080	The whole black lives matter protesters of great interest to me personally.
1691080	1702080	And how can we understand what's going on here, why, why do society seem to go through periods of stasis, and then these incredibly rapid bursts of change.
1702080	1709080	Is there a sort of unifying framework for evolution and revolution in social systems.
1709080	1718080	The kinds of things I'm interested in things like this, you know, why do we go from extraordinary intolerance of homosexuality to accepting it.
1718080	1727080	Going so far as to allow for gay marriage, which to me is a real fantastic evolutionary move of society. What changed in people's thinking.
1727080	1735080	By the way, there's a nice typo here this is Oscar Wilde 1985, which is not quite right.
1735080	1743080	So, this, you know, attitudes for this is for the fiction on the left, anyone is rock history realize the two very different people.
1743080	1750080	But this sort of scare tactics that people have used to sort of discourage people from taking recreational drugs and maybe they're right maybe they're wrong.
1750080	1756080	But then the shift towards a much more permissive society.
1756080	1763080	And political beliefs, I mean, endlessly oscillating back and forth between political parties.
1763080	1771080	Can we sort of wrap this system up in a common mathematical framework so that we can understand properties of all of them.
1771080	1785080	And as I said I think the answer is yes, because they're all characterized by having multiple time scales with individual learning rules that percolate up through the time scales, often in invisible ways, leading to very dramatic shifts.
1785080	1797080	The kind of data that we look at to see if your senses is it like this, all across the board. Why, for example, did seat belts once they're adept adopted lock.
1797080	1807080	It's very unlikely that we're going to move back to a state where people say you know, let's get rid of the mandatory seat belt law. It seems like a bad idea.
1807080	1817080	Whereas political parties, fortunes are constantly shifting attitudes towards the death penalty are constantly shifting and so on.
1817080	1825080	I mean, it would be kind of nice right if attitudes towards same sex marriage or the death penalty look more like the seat belt in a progressive sense.
1825080	1831080	And once we'd adopted them we stayed that way and didn't constantly fluctuate that can we understand one of this.
1832080	1843080	And so these are the kinds of questions we're asking here. How did these systems evolve. How do we as individuals, or as collectors contribute to these institutions.
1843080	1852080	So I use this word institution by the way to mean scientific belief systems or organizations companies could be IBM.
1852080	1861080	How do individual micro learning rules percolate through to the emergent structure of the, of the macro properties of the institution.
1861080	1872080	And what does an institution do that wants to change, but finds itself like the seat belt locked in.
1872080	1878080	You know, can we are their normative implications just as they're worth a conflict.
1878080	1885080	So this is the basic structure of these models, you have collectives at the bottom.
1885080	1893080	They express their support or position to an institution through voting mechanics.
1893080	1919080	And we think of the institutions as a ledger that records in its entries, votes, aggregates preferences and beliefs, and it has a public position, and that public position feeds back to reinforce or inhibit the collectives that are
1919080	1931080	going to support or inhibit them in other words, members of a Republican Party will support their own party, but they will do everything their power to oppose the Democratic Party and Democratic beliefs and vice versa.
1931080	1942080	So, the same kind of logic applies by the way to scientific revolutions here's the so called Copernican Revolution, you have Copernicus saying you know, you know everybody.
1943080	1954080	It's kind of a possibility thing, but you've got the church saying well no it's kind of a little bit at odds with what we've been saying for the last however many thousand years, we'd rather you shut up.
1954080	1968080	And so again that sort of dynamic of voting opposition and support with feedback from the institutions because that's crucial right because if the institution helps you, you gain power.
1968080	1972080	So you can take that and mathematics it.
1972080	1982080	For those of you with keen eyes you'll see this looks like a perceptron it's a very simple neural network, but it's all analytical doesn't matter.
1982080	1996080	Mathematize it and explore. This is going to be the technical point and it's coming to the end which I would sort of get your heads around the crucial role of learning rules, which are the rules that reinforce your beliefs and support or
1997080	2010080	based on the success of your corresponding institution. So let me just show you what I mean. So here's a case. Let's say X supports IX and Y supports IY the institution Y.
2010080	2024080	One learning will be to say look, if there's lots of us, lots of X's, let's say supporters of the Copernican Revolution, we're going to support Copernicus and all publications that promulgate a heliocentric position.
2024080	2037080	But if you're a member of, let's say the time, a religious fraternity or church, if you're more numerous you'll support your institutions in that case they say the Catholic Church.
2037080	2042080	That's one kind of rule it says you learn in accordance with your success.
2042080	2054080	That kind of rule is quite opposite to that is that actually I might just attend if I'm being successful, why bother? Why bother doing more work? I've already won.
2054080	2060080	I'm going to divest from supporting my institution because I'm in the leading position.
2060080	2069080	Here's an interesting one, an arms race. An arms race says, I'm going to support my institution in proportion to the success of my rival.
2069080	2083080	So think about nuclear expansion. If your opponent doesn't have weapons then why should you? So your support of your institution is in proportion to your competitors' abundance.
2083080	2096080	So you can write down all these simple rules which tell you how to construct institutions according to their abundance if you like or power or size.
2096080	2101080	And on and on you can go and you can actually mathematically look at all possible permutations.
2101080	2115080	And if you do that you make some interesting discoveries. If you use, for example, this rule which says invest in your institution in proportion to its size, you get lock-in.
2116080	2125080	You're going to fix on a single institution and never change it. And you can sort of see intuitively why that's the case because you're not attending to the competitor at all.
2125080	2131080	And the bigger you get and the bigger your institution becomes the more you support it, lock-in.
2131080	2140080	The same is true with the other rules. The arms race is the opposite, right? It says, I support my institution in proportion to the competitor.
2140080	2146080	And that leads to endless cycling periodicity.
2146080	2165080	So what this sort of work is showing is that the incentive system that society puts in place, that is the reinforcement learning rule, has strong emerging consequences on the stasis or the ability of the corresponding institution.
2165080	2177080	And that suggests that you could change them. So for example, let's say you were in a lock-in situation and you're a company like Kodak and you say, well, look, we make the best film in the world, we should make more of it.
2177080	2181080	And then all of a sudden the market changes and you're extinct.
2181080	2196080	So you could, as a leadership team say, I'm going to create a new learning rule amongst my employees that instead of investing in proportion to our market share, we're going to look at the competitor,
2196080	2202080	change the norms, change the incentives, and move into an oscillatory regime where you allow for the possibility of flexibility.
2202080	2210080	So this is just an example of these very counterintuitive ways in which local incentive learning systems have emergent properties at the institutional level.
2210080	2217080	And I just wanted to make that point. That rule there is an institutional black hole. This is Kodak, this is research in motion.
2217080	2220080	Follow these rules, stasis.
2220080	2230080	So okay, so how do institution evolves in this particular case feedback from institutions that are established through some collective voting dynamic.
2230080	2236080	How do you construct, use different learning rules to do so?
2236080	2248080	So these rules in a very non-intuitive way, bias, the stability of the institutions, and how do you change, you have to change the learning rule.
2248080	2252080	You have to, that's the key and that's very hard.
2252080	2261080	So let's just end with this Murray statement, Murray making that point that we're living in this highly connected world, someone should be studying the whole system.
2261080	2276080	And I think that the correct interpretation of that kind of insight is that we should be studying global representative systems that have a mechanic that is constitutive of that system.
2276080	2289080	We should be studying culture, conflict, institutions, cities, pandemics. These are the kinds of processes where we have a principal means of attaching to them, mechanics and dynamics.
2289080	2292080	And I have absolutely no idea it's a spaghetti.
2292080	2304080	And you'll note that these are disciplines, they span them, but they're as disciplined as the disciplines, which is the sort of mantra that I try my best to follow.
2305080	2310080	For those interested in SFI, go to our webpage.
2310080	2320080	If you scroll down to the bottom of the Santa Fe Institute webpage, you can subscribe to our publications, you can join our podcast.
2320080	2328080	There's all sorts of information available there for you that you will either hate or love, according to a disposition, but it's worth having a look because there's a lot of material.
2328080	2336080	And with that, I'll wrap up. Thank you very much.
2336080	2339080	Thanks, David.
2339080	2341080	That was fantastic.
2341080	2346080	Just, we need a whole day on this.
2346080	2348080	Fantastic.
2348080	2356080	And I do encourage everybody to go to SFI and check out what they're doing. It's a very special place. You still do tea, David.
2356080	2359080	We do tea.
2359080	2367080	Tea was sort of the most amazing thing where you get to meet these just people from all over and talk a little bit about tea.
2367080	2377080	Well, it's interesting, you know, I mean, this is, we've all been debating this move towards this world, right, this online world, which has extraordinary like this.
2377080	2380080	Yes, I mean, you can do this thing, which is fantastic.
2380080	2397080	But what is missed and I think the obvious point is that this is very telegraphic, right? In other words, I just waffled on for 30 minutes, but we'll have questions for 15 and most people won't have a chance to ask, you know, it's whereas if you're in person, someone can really
2397080	2400080	really pester you.
2400080	2412080	And it's great. But also you can move back and forth, you know, clarifying what people mean, because it's very often takes two or three questions to sort of get to, oh, that's your sense.
2412080	2422080	That's what you mean. I sorry I misunderstood you. And so tea is our sort of mechanic for doing just that we pretend it's this informal thing which it is.
2422080	2430080	And really is it's recognized in the complexity of human interactions, and that it takes time to understand each other.
2430080	2433080	So I don't, that's what she's for.
2433080	2450080	So at SFI they have a courtyard and people just have tea and, you know, all, all manner of conversations are sparked at tea and you could have a physicist and a sociologist and a mathematician and a, you know, all kinds of different
2450080	2454080	people talking about an issue it's fantastic.
2454080	2467080	But one thing to say that I'd like to point out I didn't talk about SFI and its structure, but to do the kind of work that I just described as a tiny slither of work it happens to you work that I've been involved with I could have talked about other people's work.
2467080	2470080	You need a different kind of organization.
2470080	2475080	And so we don't have obviously departments, we don't have deans, we don't have that stuff.
2475080	2489080	So we, and in offices which are typically shared you'll have an archaeologist with quantum mechanist right and by the end of the summer they're working on a problem together, because they like each other.
2489080	2499080	I mean it's sort of simple as that. And so the structure of respects I think the mission in terms of what we want to accomplish.
2499080	2504080	So I'm curious, you started with the one of Murray's quotes.
2504080	2511080	Think of how difficult physics would be if Adams could think is a fantastic concept.
2511080	2526080	And Murray Gellman also wrote a very short paper called, let's call it Plectix which really got at the root definition and root word forms of simple and complex.
2526080	2532080	Can you talk a little bit about that relationship between simplicity and complexity and why that's important.
2532080	2538080	Yeah, I have lots of slides on it I didn't want to do this because there's so many times, but I will do it verbally.
2538080	2554080	So one way to think about this is that where have the, because we are a quantitative department I don't think you need to be to work in systems or complexity quite frankly think philosophers do it very well only natural language, but we could do it that way.
2555080	2572080	One way to say this is that, you know, physics has been so successful the kind of Murray worked on that I illustrated, because it's so simple meaning there are laws like conservation matter of energy matter and so forth the second or so.
2572080	2577080	Fundamental symmetries, and that's what mathematics likes.
2578080	2588080	It captures in a very compressed elegant form regularities, the essence of mathematics, Pythagoras theorem.
2588080	2599080	On the other end of the spectrum have random things like the ideal gas law. It turns out, maybe counterintuitively the highly random systems also can be compressed with very simple laws.
2599080	2609080	Yeah, in the middle between the world of extreme regularities like the celestial mechanics, or on the right, you know, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.
2609080	2617080	You have this domain, which has randomness in it, but randomness that accumulates regularities like evolutionary history.
2617080	2618080	Right.
2618080	2635080	That is the domain of complexity is the domain of living systems, and people say well you mean you're just biologists, and we'll say, well in one sense yes, but we're studying markets as well and we're studying ancient civilizations and archaeology.
2635080	2648080	It's the living world that we study, but we study it through that hubristic lens of, can we find theories that are general for the living world.
2648080	2659080	And it turns out that theories in that domain have a different character in part because they have to contend with agency.
2659080	2664080	And I would say if you ask me what is the channel of the 20th the challenge of our century.
2664080	2680080	It is this it's that two paradigms have emerged to contend with that machine learning and complexity science and I'm willing to make that a very broad church, but I am a deserfite.
2680080	2688080	And one of them is highly predictive and opaque machine learning.
2688080	2701080	The other one is less predictive but gives you the possibility of understanding how it actually works, explaining to people what's going on, you know, pedagogy.
2701080	2713080	And I think that we're at a very interesting bifurcation point in our history where that's never happened before. And if you look at the 17th and 18th centuries those two things were very close.
2713080	2721080	Newton could be both predictive, but also teach you how calculus works and you can write down how people's may I mean it's that simple.
2722080	2741080	Nowadays, that's not true. And I think we're now contending with these two churches, the predictive, opaque, and the explanatory transparent, and I'm very interested in that in that schism.
2741080	2750080	I want to talk a little bit about that schism with with the human dream and and how that, how that relates.
2750080	2752080	You share a little bit about that.
2752080	2758080	Can you just expand on that, you know, yeah, well just that then there's human thinking.
2758080	2768080	There are these agents that that don't aren't seeing the transparency of the system and they're behaving a lot of a lot of what you just talked about in contagion and culture.
2768080	2786080	How do we have that loop back to the agent so that they can change their learning rules or whatever to change. Yeah, yeah, I mean that in a way but is this is our, this is part of our agenda right to understand individual freedom in the face of institutional constraint.
2787080	2794080	I don't think we have answers to that I think we can analyze cases.
2794080	2803080	We still valorize the individual certainly in the United States in the West is a very strong emphasis placed on individual creativity, perhaps overstated.
2803080	2815080	You know, we all know that theories aren't really invented by single people that through hidden history they're hidden figures that made huge contributions that get neglected or ignored.
2815080	2826080	There's right carving out the space for individual freedom and free will in the face of these very powerful constraints, which are market driven.
2826080	2844080	I mean this has been one of my crusades you know I mean, there's nothing wrong with platforms that harness collective power, but when those platforms have an incentive that is misaligned with human freedom, I sort of good war on them.
2844080	2855080	You know, and I will be an example of my own field, the journal system scientific publication appear review it's a perfect example of a corrupt system, because we all know it everyone's not doing it, of course it is.
2855080	2868080	It's embarrassing. Here we are researchers, and we are completely beholden to a system that does not have the progression of science at the forefront, but sales.
2869080	2875080	And so, it's not that I'm anti market it's just one of those things become misaligned.
2875080	2883080	Then we have to rethink. So we're constantly having these battles I wish we had them more often, and we had more victories under our belt.
2883080	2884080	Yeah.
2884080	2896080	So an audience member asked, how can we use these complexity models to appreciate better the external drivers for the changes we see.
2896080	2906080	And I think, yeah, that gets back to your question Jerry earlier which is, they in some sense formalize the contributions of the constraints.
2906080	2916080	I mean that's partly what they're all doing. I mean they're trying to, you know, where do we have free freedom to move and where the constraints established by the institutional feedback.
2916080	2933080	And I think in every case we sort of have to sort of analyze how much is being driven by the constraint, and how much is being driven by our decisions, which is made even more complicated by the fact that our decisions emerge through a history of institutional
2933080	2946080	and not even clear that we are free I mean there's some very difficult issues hiding in these circular feedback systems, where you how to attribute causality, but they do I mean just to get a question.
2946080	2956080	You can actually do that you can partition for any given synchronous observation, how much comes from the constraint and how much is coming from your internal state.
2957080	2960080	You can start getting at those things.
2960080	2969080	I want to give you a chance to talk a little bit more about learning rules that the based on the success of the corresponding institution there.
2969080	2981080	Say a little bit more about are the learning rules merely evolutions of the original rules, meaning like their schema that are just evolving as a result of feedback.
2981080	2982080	Yeah.
2982080	2997080	So what the paper actually that goes into detail is it's actually going to be published on May 16. And it's called on institutional dynamics and learning rules. So that will go that might help people.
2997080	3007080	That was for that particular model, a full discrete enumeration of all possible learning rules. So we can do that in this very simple setting.
3007080	3014080	And then pick any given one right and ask what are the implications if that were being used.
3014080	3020080	So we don't have we don't look at the full continuous space between all rules and someone.
3020080	3040080	I think the purpose of that work was to show that there is a, I think quite counterintuitive relationship between the local incentive reward system, and the ensuing institutional dynamic that that's the purpose of that work because if you look at the literature
3040080	3045080	on institutions, it tends to work at the institutional level.
3045080	3051080	It doesn't have these multiple time scales, which is mathematically by the way of heart.
3051080	3067080	And this is something that's a hidden idea here that one should surface which is that much of theorizing for good reasons is led by analytical expediency.
3067080	3076080	I mean, especially economics, where they love that. And the question for our community is, when are we willing to forfeit that.
3076080	3082080	And that's really the move to machine learning or simulation right where you say, you know what.
3082080	3094080	No, I mean, it's so far from reality. I don't care if you understand your model, it's useless, you know, and then that's a kind of people set that threshold at different points somehow.
3094080	3102080	It would be very interesting, you might know, why do we do that psychologically, why do we have different preferences for that.
3102080	3105080	I think we have time for one.
3105080	3108080	Do we have time for one more.
3108080	3111080	Laura.
3111080	3115080	Yeah, time for one or two more. Okay, good.
3115080	3135080	So another audience question. It's actually two questions. Does your work provide any insight into the role of relationships of the agents of systems and second does the fact that contagion hovers around criticality have anything to do with enhancement of adaptive capacity of the agents.
3135080	3138080	Okay.
3138080	3144080	So, yeah, I mean, I think the latter, that's very interesting.
3144080	3154080	I think the answer has to be yes to that second part because, as in the example right of hovering by our zero equals one.
3154080	3164080	It's precisely because we are so adaptive that happens right because as soon as we observe the information bearing on the subcritical regime we take them off.
3164080	3173080	If we weren't adaptive we wouldn't, we would fix, and the actually the pandemic would go away it's sort of a peculiar perverse situation to be in.
3173080	3183080	So yes, absolutely I think you're absolutely right. Adaptability is, I think the key ingredient of tuning to criticality.
3183080	3189080	And, but you know what we're going to do to get rid of adaptability.
3189080	3195080	And the first part seemed to me a more obscure I wasn't sure I understood the first part of the question.
3195080	3207080	Well, I think that's interesting and follow up on that. So a lot of the systems that our students deal with are is, is, you know, so you found this this results from a mathematical model.
3207080	3214080	But how do you feedback that that learning to the agent, like in the case of COVID.
3214080	3227080	If the if the individual agents could change their schema or their mental model so therefore changing their, you know, behavior, you would get of it, we could get rid of coven right.
3227080	3241080	So how do we take, you know, it seems to me the hard part is we learn these things about the at the systemic level, but how do you get the individual agents to change based on that awareness.
3241080	3244080	I mean that seems to be like the crux of the whole.
3244080	3254080	I mean, it's even worse for climate change because it's interesting I was in sabbatical at Harvard actually when the pandemic hit.
3254080	3265080	And I was actually working at the Center for the environment which works on climate and immediately the conversation we were having is odia.
3265080	3273080	How do we deal with systems that are massive global tragic collective commons problems.
3273080	3277080	Like emulating climate change.
3277080	3284080	But also operate on time scales where the change of our behaviors not the implications of changing or maybe not obvious.
3284080	3285080	Yeah.
3285080	3293080	I just gave a good example I think that in coven at least we see it right now part of seeing it is we adapt in the wrong direction.
3293080	3295080	Yes, earlier question.
3295080	3299080	So climate's a problem because there's no feedback.
3299080	3314080	Say, there's no learning will come no learning no learning rule happens and there's so much delay. There's so much delay. And what I've heard discussed here is how do what are the appropriate metaphors that we could start inculcating
3314080	3321080	in people's minds that would help them understand delayed feedback. For example, gardening, gardening.
3321080	3324080	Anyone who plants a garden.
3324080	3326080	Right, and I'm very impatient.
3326080	3327080	I'm not going to.
3327080	3335080	But there are people who are very good at it. And they, you realize I'm going to do all this now but I'm not going to see the fruits of my labor for about three seasons.
3336080	3352080	It's going to be really scrappy next year and then you know and so on. And I think there are things that humans do that have those longer time scales where we're willing to operate with delayed gratification right delayed right.
3352080	3366080	It seems to be the case here and I think I don't have an answer but I suspect educating people to think about pandemics and things like them, the way they would think about gardening or something.
3366080	3375080	Yeah, would be very powerful and but unfortunately we do the opposite because we say we're going to have an RNA vaccine in a month.
3375080	3387080	Right. And so, whatever virtuous long term thinking started to mature is immediately obliterated by the experience of an instantaneous vaccine.
3387080	3396080	I'm not blaming vaccine development that's fantastic but these things are actually kind of in competition in our minds.
3396080	3411080	I love the idea of the metaphors and kind of metaphors we live by like the fruits of our labor really is built into that is a metaphor of delay. Yes, and and so if we had these sort of systems metaphors that we could, you know, raise
3411080	3425080	children on. Yes, then when they get to adulthood they would they would sort of understand that cause and effect aren't always neighbors on a timeline and you just recursively use the metaphor by saying raising children.
3425080	3428080	It's another.
3428080	3430080	Exactly. That's right.
3430080	3446080	Thank you so much David, I really appreciate the talk it's an amazing talk and amazing ideas and I wish we had many more hours to chat but thank you for for your, your talk and answering questions.
3446080	3453080	Thank you very much everybody thank you Derek and Laura for inviting me and hope to see you some point at SFI virtually one person.
3453080	3456080	Yes, much appreciated.
3456080	3458080	Okay.
3460080	3462080	Thank you.
