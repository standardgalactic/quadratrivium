Checking YouTube Viewers/Features impacted by COPPAï¼š Made for Kids content.txt
 YouTube, under the guidance of Lauren from Family Partnerships, has implemented significant changes to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and address concerns raised by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). These changes are effective as of today and aim to better protect children's privacy online.

Key points of the changes include:

1. **Advertisements**: Personalized ads will no longer be shown on content made for kids. Instead, contextual ads will appear, which do not rely on user data.

2. **Monetization Features**: Super Chat, the Merch Shelf, and other creator monetization features that require user information will be turned off on videos targeted at children.

3. **Interactive Features**: Comments, live chat, notifications, playlisting, and the use of the mini-player will be disabled for content made for kids to reduce data collection.

4. **Channel Features**: Channels that are entirely targeted towards kids will also have features like stories, the notification bell, and the community tab turned off, as these features rely on user data.

5. **YouTube's Intended Audience**: YouTube is not intended for users under 13 years old. The platform actively removes accounts that belong to children under this age.

6. **YouTube Kids App**: YouTube remains committed to providing high-quality kids' content through the YouTube Kids app, which can be accessed on various devices, including mobile, computers, and TVs. Recent updates include expanded signed-in support for parents to manage their child's experience more effectively.

7. **Creator Support**: YouTube is providing resources and guidance for creators who produce kids' content to help them adjust to these new regulations and mark their content accordingly.

8. **Ongoing Engagement with Lawmakers**: YouTube will continue to engage with the FTC and other lawmakers on this issue.

9. **Resources for Creators and Users**: For creators looking to understand how to mark their content as made for kids or not, YouTube has provided two videos on the YouTube Creators channel, which are linked in the description for further information. Additionally, YouTube will maintain an updated list of frequently asked questions in the pinned comment section below the announcement video.

YouTube encourages users and creators to reach out with any questions regarding these changes.
