The Science of Simple Spans. Let's learn about The Science of Simple Spans, and this

00:06.360 --> 00:15.040
information was provided by Glenn Matthewson, who is a consultant and educator with BuildingCodeCollege.com.

00:15.040 --> 00:20.980
Maximum Joy Span seems like a pretty simple concept, but there's obviously a natural

00:20.980 --> 00:27.320
limit to how far wood can span without breaking under a particular load. But when inspecting

00:27.320 --> 00:33.140
a house, we don't want to see any floor joist getting anywhere near that breaking point.

00:33.140 --> 00:39.520
We don't even want a joist to bend all that much. So when we talk about maximum joy spans

00:39.520 --> 00:44.760
as the International Residential Code defines them, we're not really talking about pushing

00:44.760 --> 00:50.720
things to the limit. We're largely talking about what it takes to have a functional

00:50.720 --> 00:56.840
floor, one that doesn't overly bounce or won't rattle when we walk on it. Check out

00:56.840 --> 01:04.280
this sketch about joists, spans, load, compression, and tension. Loading a joist creates bending

01:04.280 --> 01:11.000
stress that puts wood fibers at the top in compression and at the bottom in tension.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.920
The height of the joist and the species of the lumber affects how well it handles these

01:15.920 --> 01:22.920
stresses. Taller joists and denser species deflect less and allow it to span farther.

01:22.920 --> 01:28.960
The IRC span tables make it easy for contractors and inspectors to pick up a joist to bridge

01:28.960 --> 01:33.880
a simple span, one without intermediate supports or cantilevers, or to get the biggest simple

01:33.880 --> 01:39.940
span out of the wood available. But span is just one of many roles relating to joists.

01:39.940 --> 01:46.200
There are other rules for blocking, notching, and bearing lengths. And all of these roles

01:46.200 --> 01:50.760
can be read alone, but when taken together and mixed with a little science, they start

01:50.760 --> 01:57.040
to make sense, not as arbitrary roles, but as the means to reach the expected ends. Home

01:57.040 --> 02:02.560
inspectors don't need an engineering degree to understand how these various joist-related

02:02.560 --> 02:08.480
provisions in the code work together. So let's discuss them informally. The first step in

02:08.480 --> 02:14.680
designing a floor system for a house is to determine how much you expect it to support,

02:14.680 --> 02:20.360
and that's load. The heavier the load imposed on a joist or beam, the shorter the distance

02:20.360 --> 02:26.760
it can safely and functionally span. This shortening isn't because the code is concerned

02:26.760 --> 02:33.520
about the floor breaking. It doesn't want it to bend too much. The flexion, rather than

02:33.520 --> 02:41.160
strength, is the foremost limiter to span in conventional wood frame construction. Maximum

02:41.160 --> 02:46.960
deflection is the most a building system or component is allowed to bend under its maximum

02:47.000 --> 02:53.200
design load. Floors have historically been held to L divided by 360, where you divide

02:53.200 --> 02:58.520
the joist length and inches by 360, and you get the maximum deflection allowed for a given

02:58.520 --> 03:05.200
span. We can refer to table R301.7 in the IRC. We can also take the internet cheese

03:05.200 --> 03:10.600
free online structural issues course for home inspectors to calculate deflection of

03:10.600 --> 03:16.640
a joist. As an example, for any 14 foot joist, the deflection limit is about a half an inch.

03:16.640 --> 03:22.400
That's 168 divided by 360 approximately. The L divided by 360 deflection limit for floor

03:22.400 --> 03:27.440
joists exists for at least two good reasons. One, it should prevent the drywall or the

03:27.440 --> 03:33.520
plaster sealing below from cracking. It's also about how stiff the occupant expects

03:33.520 --> 03:39.320
the floor to feel when they walk on it. While a trampoline can support the 40 pound per

03:39.320 --> 03:45.120
square foot live load prescribed for residential living areas, it would make a rather impractical

03:45.120 --> 03:51.440
kitchen floor. If more deflection than L360 were allowed, the allowable spans would increase,

03:51.440 --> 03:56.200
but the floor wouldn't be as stiff. If you span less than the maximum allowed for a

03:56.200 --> 04:03.280
given joist, it will deflect less and feel stiffer. So what gives a joist stiffness?

04:03.280 --> 04:07.800
When a load is put on a joist, the fibers in the top of the joist compress, and those

04:07.800 --> 04:12.320
in the bottom are under tension. And in the middle, what engineers call the neutral plane,

04:12.320 --> 04:18.240
these forces diminish the zero. The ability of the wood fibers to resist being scrunched

04:18.240 --> 04:24.300
by compression or stretched out by tension directly translates to how much a joist deflects

04:24.300 --> 04:30.240
and is why denser wood species can span farther. They're better at resisting the stretching

04:30.240 --> 04:36.760
and the scrunching, and therefore they deflect less. Still, height can make up for the deficiencies

04:36.760 --> 04:42.400
of a species. The more mass is distributed away from the center of a joist, or toward

04:42.400 --> 04:47.520
the tension and compression edges, in other words, the taller the joist, the better it

04:47.520 --> 04:52.760
resists deflection. Thus a two by 10 can span farther than a two by eight of the same grade

04:52.760 --> 04:57.560
in species. And this is also why eye joists can span extreme distances without a major

04:57.560 --> 05:05.240
increase in depth. Much, if not most, of their mass is in the top and bottom flanges. These

05:05.320 --> 05:12.400
tension and compression stresses are also what moves the load to the ends of the joist,

05:12.400 --> 05:18.200
for transfer to whatever's below, typically beams, hangers, or plates. And for this transfer

05:18.200 --> 05:23.240
of load to work, the joist must be held in a state of stress. A joist not stressing is

05:23.240 --> 05:29.080
a joist deflecting. Joists will lay down on the job if permitted to, and a joist laid flat

05:29.080 --> 05:33.920
like decking can't span very far without bending along its thickness. Given the way

05:34.040 --> 05:39.000
houses are built, that isn't what happens. Instead, joists, especially when overspanned or

05:39.000 --> 05:46.000
overloaded, try to flop over in the middle of the span. Joist thickness is a large part

05:46.000 --> 05:50.920
of what presents this kind of flop. While the height handles the stress, the thickness

05:50.920 --> 05:56.800
of the joist helps keep it upright and handles the stress. The ratio between thickness and

05:56.800 --> 06:02.800
height is important, and most obvious in beams, where additional plies and larger sawn

06:02.840 --> 06:07.840
thicknesses are common. Sawn joists on the other hand, no matter how tall, are always

06:07.840 --> 06:12.840
one and a half inches thick. So even though a sawn joist can handle more stress as it

06:12.840 --> 06:18.720
gets taller, it also gets harder to keep it upright. Thanks to other code provisions and

06:18.720 --> 06:25.560
common sense, the width of the joist doesn't have to do the job alone. Blocking rim joists

06:25.560 --> 06:31.480
or joist hangers at the ends and bearing locations are what ultimately keep the joist upright

06:31.560 --> 06:37.720
and stressed. Our 502.7 in the code will help. Other than hangers, which also support the

06:37.720 --> 06:42.680
vertical load, these other features do almost exclusively that. Blocking and rim joists

06:42.680 --> 06:49.240
resist rotation. When the height of the joist compared to its width is greater than 212,

06:49.240 --> 06:54.440
the width can't hold the joist upright along their length, and bridge blocking is required

06:54.440 --> 06:59.720
within the span to prevent the joist from rolling over. Home inspectors are not code

06:59.720 --> 07:06.120
inspectors, but home inspectors can get out the code book and look at the science. If you

07:06.120 --> 07:11.560
want to stiffer floor with less deflection, you just need better stress management. You

07:11.560 --> 07:17.360
could use larger joists height, denser wood species or closer joy spacing, or you could

07:17.360 --> 07:22.520
add bridge blocking with the span to reduce mid span rotation of the joist. So let's say

07:22.520 --> 07:28.120
you have a two by 10 joist that's slightly overspend. Its primary failure is excessive

07:28.120 --> 07:34.360
deflection. And the usual reason for that is it wants to flop over in mid span. The same

07:34.360 --> 07:39.960
principles that stiffen a floor to above code deflection limits can stiffen an overspend floor

07:39.960 --> 07:45.000
up to the deflection limit. The code will tell you this, but we will. Bridge blocking can bring

07:45.000 --> 07:50.840
slightly overspend joists to within deflection limits. And that's a more reasonable alternative

07:50.840 --> 07:57.800
recommendation than to replacing the two by 10s with two by 12s. After deflection, shear is the

07:57.800 --> 08:03.320
next stress that joists need to be able to handle. But it typically isn't a major consideration in

08:03.320 --> 08:09.320
wood joists. Shear stresses are distributed opposite of bending stresses. They are greatest

08:09.320 --> 08:15.560
along the horizontal center of the joist, that neutral plane, an increase towards the ends.

08:16.280 --> 08:21.080
Shear failures in sawn joists typically appear as cracks that start at the ends and propagate

08:21.080 --> 08:26.040
along the neutral plane. In other words, along the grain. And this kind of failure would be

08:26.040 --> 08:32.840
problematic because two small joists aren't equivalent to one big joist. Each smaller piece

08:32.840 --> 08:39.000
deflects more than one big one would. But it's highly unusual for a sawn joist to fail in shear

08:39.000 --> 08:44.680
along its length. Shear across the grain is even rarer, if not unheard of, because of the way the

08:44.680 --> 08:50.680
grain is oriented. It's much easier to split wood along the grain than it is to chop across the

08:50.680 --> 08:56.920
grain, right? Research has shown joists will fail in bending long before they fail in shear,

08:56.920 --> 09:01.960
which is why, despite the shear stresses being largest at the end of the joist, the IRC allows

09:01.960 --> 09:07.800
joist ends to be notched up to one quarter of the depth of the joist. No notches are allowed in the

09:07.800 --> 09:13.000
middle third of the joist, where the bending stresses are the greatest. And in the rest of the

09:13.000 --> 09:19.080
joist, where bending stresses are smaller, they're limited to one sixth of the joist depth.

09:19.720 --> 09:25.480
Holes, meanwhile, are allowed two inches away from the edges, anywhere in the span,

09:25.480 --> 09:30.040
which tells you how little there is to worry about when it comes to shear stresses.

09:31.320 --> 09:36.280
We also have to think about bearing. Once joists are loaded, they have to transfer the load

09:36.280 --> 09:41.880
vertically. The key here is preventing the joist or the member that the joist is bearing on

09:42.520 --> 09:48.840
from crushing. Wood crushes more easily across the grain, like where the ends are located,

09:48.840 --> 09:53.560
than it does parallel with the grain, such as a post. The size of the bearing area required to

09:53.560 --> 09:59.560
prevent crushing is directly related to the strength of the joist, what it's bearing on,

09:59.560 --> 10:05.880
and the total load being transferred. Distributing the load over a greater area reduces the load

10:05.880 --> 10:09.880
on any one point, which can in turn allow for greater loads. It's just like how

10:09.960 --> 10:15.800
snowshoes distribute your weight to keep you from sinking in the snow. This is another engineering

10:15.800 --> 10:23.240
fundamental the IRC simplifies. For joist bearing on wood or metal, section 502.6 of the code requires

10:23.240 --> 10:29.320
the full width to bear with at least one and a half inches of length. This minimum area of wood

10:29.320 --> 10:34.920
necessary to transfer the loads that a floor designed using the IRC's prescriptive tables

10:34.920 --> 10:41.480
can generate without overstressing the joist and crushing its ends. The minimum bearing length

10:41.480 --> 10:46.040
on concrete is three inches, but this longer length isn't about the wood, it's about the

10:46.040 --> 10:51.400
concrete. A joist bearing on concrete creates stresses that can cause the corner of the concrete

10:51.400 --> 10:57.240
or masonry to crack and spoil or break off under the joist. And the three inches of required bearing

10:57.800 --> 11:03.640
spreads the load over a greater area to reduce the chance of spalling and leaves enough area behind

11:03.640 --> 11:09.560
the compromised edge for the joist to bear safely if it does fall. This information was provided by
