1. **Stress Management in Joists**: If you have an overspanned joist with excessive deflection, you can use various strategies to reduce the movement and bring it within acceptable limits. One such strategy is adding bridge blocking, which is a piece of lumber that spans between joists at specific points along the span to stiffen the floor.

2. **Bridge Blocking**: This technique is particularly useful for bringing overspanned joists (like a 2x10) back into compliance without having to replace them with larger joists (like 2x12s). It helps to reduce mid-span rotation of the joist, which is often the cause of excessive deflection.

3. **Deflection vs. Shear**: While shear stress is another factor that joists must handle, it is typically not a major concern in wood joists compared to bending stress. Joists are more likely to fail due to bending before they fail due to shear. The IRC (International Residential Code) allows for notches at the ends of joists but restricts them in the middle third where bending stresses are greatest.

4. **Bearing Considerations**: When joists bear on other materials, such as wood or metal, the IRC specifies minimum bearing requirements to prevent crushing. For wood or metal, the full width must bear with at least one and a half inches of length. For concrete, the minimum bearing length is three inches to avoid spalling or damaging the concrete. This longer length ensures that the load is distributed over a larger area, which reduces the risk of cracking or breaking off the concrete edge.
