0	6360	The Science of Simple Spans. Let's learn about The Science of Simple Spans, and this
6360	15040	information was provided by Glenn Matthewson, who is a consultant and educator with BuildingCodeCollege.com.
15040	20980	Maximum Joy Span seems like a pretty simple concept, but there's obviously a natural
20980	27320	limit to how far wood can span without breaking under a particular load. But when inspecting
27320	33140	a house, we don't want to see any floor joist getting anywhere near that breaking point.
33140	39520	We don't even want a joist to bend all that much. So when we talk about maximum joy spans
39520	44760	as the International Residential Code defines them, we're not really talking about pushing
44760	50720	things to the limit. We're largely talking about what it takes to have a functional
50720	56840	floor, one that doesn't overly bounce or won't rattle when we walk on it. Check out
56840	64280	this sketch about joists, spans, load, compression, and tension. Loading a joist creates bending
64280	71000	stress that puts wood fibers at the top in compression and at the bottom in tension.
71000	75920	The height of the joist and the species of the lumber affects how well it handles these
75920	82920	stresses. Taller joists and denser species deflect less and allow it to span farther.
82920	88960	The IRC span tables make it easy for contractors and inspectors to pick up a joist to bridge
88960	93880	a simple span, one without intermediate supports or cantilevers, or to get the biggest simple
93880	99940	span out of the wood available. But span is just one of many roles relating to joists.
99940	106200	There are other rules for blocking, notching, and bearing lengths. And all of these roles
106200	110760	can be read alone, but when taken together and mixed with a little science, they start
110760	117040	to make sense, not as arbitrary roles, but as the means to reach the expected ends. Home
117040	122560	inspectors don't need an engineering degree to understand how these various joist-related
122560	128480	provisions in the code work together. So let's discuss them informally. The first step in
128480	134680	designing a floor system for a house is to determine how much you expect it to support,
134680	140360	and that's load. The heavier the load imposed on a joist or beam, the shorter the distance
140360	146760	it can safely and functionally span. This shortening isn't because the code is concerned
146760	153520	about the floor breaking. It doesn't want it to bend too much. The flexion, rather than
153520	161160	strength, is the foremost limiter to span in conventional wood frame construction. Maximum
161160	166960	deflection is the most a building system or component is allowed to bend under its maximum
167000	173200	design load. Floors have historically been held to L divided by 360, where you divide
173200	178520	the joist length and inches by 360, and you get the maximum deflection allowed for a given
178520	185200	span. We can refer to table R301.7 in the IRC. We can also take the internet cheese
185200	190600	free online structural issues course for home inspectors to calculate deflection of
190600	196640	a joist. As an example, for any 14 foot joist, the deflection limit is about a half an inch.
196640	202400	That's 168 divided by 360 approximately. The L divided by 360 deflection limit for floor
202400	207440	joists exists for at least two good reasons. One, it should prevent the drywall or the
207440	213520	plaster sealing below from cracking. It's also about how stiff the occupant expects
213520	219320	the floor to feel when they walk on it. While a trampoline can support the 40 pound per
219320	225120	square foot live load prescribed for residential living areas, it would make a rather impractical
225120	231440	kitchen floor. If more deflection than L360 were allowed, the allowable spans would increase,
231440	236200	but the floor wouldn't be as stiff. If you span less than the maximum allowed for a
236200	243280	given joist, it will deflect less and feel stiffer. So what gives a joist stiffness?
243280	247800	When a load is put on a joist, the fibers in the top of the joist compress, and those
247800	252320	in the bottom are under tension. And in the middle, what engineers call the neutral plane,
252320	258240	these forces diminish the zero. The ability of the wood fibers to resist being scrunched
258240	264300	by compression or stretched out by tension directly translates to how much a joist deflects
264300	270240	and is why denser wood species can span farther. They're better at resisting the stretching
270240	276760	and the scrunching, and therefore they deflect less. Still, height can make up for the deficiencies
276760	282400	of a species. The more mass is distributed away from the center of a joist, or toward
282400	287520	the tension and compression edges, in other words, the taller the joist, the better it
287520	292760	resists deflection. Thus a two by 10 can span farther than a two by eight of the same grade
292760	297560	in species. And this is also why eye joists can span extreme distances without a major
297560	305240	increase in depth. Much, if not most, of their mass is in the top and bottom flanges. These
305320	312400	tension and compression stresses are also what moves the load to the ends of the joist,
312400	318200	for transfer to whatever's below, typically beams, hangers, or plates. And for this transfer
318200	323240	of load to work, the joist must be held in a state of stress. A joist not stressing is
323240	329080	a joist deflecting. Joists will lay down on the job if permitted to, and a joist laid flat
329080	333920	like decking can't span very far without bending along its thickness. Given the way
334040	339000	houses are built, that isn't what happens. Instead, joists, especially when overspanned or
339000	346000	overloaded, try to flop over in the middle of the span. Joist thickness is a large part
346000	350920	of what presents this kind of flop. While the height handles the stress, the thickness
350920	356800	of the joist helps keep it upright and handles the stress. The ratio between thickness and
356800	362800	height is important, and most obvious in beams, where additional plies and larger sawn
362840	367840	thicknesses are common. Sawn joists on the other hand, no matter how tall, are always
367840	372840	one and a half inches thick. So even though a sawn joist can handle more stress as it
372840	378720	gets taller, it also gets harder to keep it upright. Thanks to other code provisions and
378720	385560	common sense, the width of the joist doesn't have to do the job alone. Blocking rim joists
385560	391480	or joist hangers at the ends and bearing locations are what ultimately keep the joist upright
391560	397720	and stressed. Our 502.7 in the code will help. Other than hangers, which also support the
397720	402680	vertical load, these other features do almost exclusively that. Blocking and rim joists
402680	409240	resist rotation. When the height of the joist compared to its width is greater than 212,
409240	414440	the width can't hold the joist upright along their length, and bridge blocking is required
414440	419720	within the span to prevent the joist from rolling over. Home inspectors are not code
419720	426120	inspectors, but home inspectors can get out the code book and look at the science. If you
426120	431560	want to stiffer floor with less deflection, you just need better stress management. You
431560	437360	could use larger joists height, denser wood species or closer joy spacing, or you could
437360	442520	add bridge blocking with the span to reduce mid span rotation of the joist. So let's say
442520	448120	you have a two by 10 joist that's slightly overspend. Its primary failure is excessive
448120	454360	deflection. And the usual reason for that is it wants to flop over in mid span. The same
454360	459960	principles that stiffen a floor to above code deflection limits can stiffen an overspend floor
459960	465000	up to the deflection limit. The code will tell you this, but we will. Bridge blocking can bring
465000	470840	slightly overspend joists to within deflection limits. And that's a more reasonable alternative
470840	477800	recommendation than to replacing the two by 10s with two by 12s. After deflection, shear is the
477800	483320	next stress that joists need to be able to handle. But it typically isn't a major consideration in
483320	489320	wood joists. Shear stresses are distributed opposite of bending stresses. They are greatest
489320	495560	along the horizontal center of the joist, that neutral plane, an increase towards the ends.
496280	501080	Shear failures in sawn joists typically appear as cracks that start at the ends and propagate
501080	506040	along the neutral plane. In other words, along the grain. And this kind of failure would be
506040	512840	problematic because two small joists aren't equivalent to one big joist. Each smaller piece
512840	519000	deflects more than one big one would. But it's highly unusual for a sawn joist to fail in shear
519000	524680	along its length. Shear across the grain is even rarer, if not unheard of, because of the way the
524680	530680	grain is oriented. It's much easier to split wood along the grain than it is to chop across the
530680	536920	grain, right? Research has shown joists will fail in bending long before they fail in shear,
536920	541960	which is why, despite the shear stresses being largest at the end of the joist, the IRC allows
541960	547800	joist ends to be notched up to one quarter of the depth of the joist. No notches are allowed in the
547800	553000	middle third of the joist, where the bending stresses are the greatest. And in the rest of the
553000	559080	joist, where bending stresses are smaller, they're limited to one sixth of the joist depth.
559720	565480	Holes, meanwhile, are allowed two inches away from the edges, anywhere in the span,
565480	570040	which tells you how little there is to worry about when it comes to shear stresses.
571320	576280	We also have to think about bearing. Once joists are loaded, they have to transfer the load
576280	581880	vertically. The key here is preventing the joist or the member that the joist is bearing on
582520	588840	from crushing. Wood crushes more easily across the grain, like where the ends are located,
588840	593560	than it does parallel with the grain, such as a post. The size of the bearing area required to
593560	599560	prevent crushing is directly related to the strength of the joist, what it's bearing on,
599560	605880	and the total load being transferred. Distributing the load over a greater area reduces the load
605880	609880	on any one point, which can in turn allow for greater loads. It's just like how
609960	615800	snowshoes distribute your weight to keep you from sinking in the snow. This is another engineering
615800	623240	fundamental the IRC simplifies. For joist bearing on wood or metal, section 502.6 of the code requires
623240	629320	the full width to bear with at least one and a half inches of length. This minimum area of wood
629320	634920	necessary to transfer the loads that a floor designed using the IRC's prescriptive tables
634920	641480	can generate without overstressing the joist and crushing its ends. The minimum bearing length
641480	646040	on concrete is three inches, but this longer length isn't about the wood, it's about the
646040	651400	concrete. A joist bearing on concrete creates stresses that can cause the corner of the concrete
651400	657240	or masonry to crack and spoil or break off under the joist. And the three inches of required bearing
657800	663640	spreads the load over a greater area to reduce the chance of spalling and leaves enough area behind
663640	669560	the compromised edge for the joist to bear safely if it does fall. This information was provided by
