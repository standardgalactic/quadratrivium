information was provided by Glenn Matthewson, who is a consultant and educator with BuildingCodeCollege.com.

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,980
Maximum Joy Span seems like a pretty simple concept, but there's obviously a natural

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:27,320
limit to how far wood can span without breaking under a particular load. But when inspecting

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,140
a house, we don't want to see any floor joist getting anywhere near that breaking point.

6
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:39,520
We don't even want a joist to bend all that much. So when we talk about maximum joy spans

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,760
as the International Residential Code defines them, we're not really talking about pushing

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,720
things to the limit. We're largely talking about what it takes to have a functional

9
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,840
floor, one that doesn't overly bounce or won't rattle when we walk on it. Check out

10
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:04,280
this sketch about joists, spans, load, compression, and tension. Loading a joist creates bending

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:11,000
stress that puts wood fibers at the top in compression and at the bottom in tension.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,920
The height of the joist and the species of the lumber affects how well it handles these

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,920
stresses. Taller joists and denser species deflect less and allow it to span farther.

14
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,960
The IRC span tables make it easy for contractors and inspectors to pick up a joist to bridge

15
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,880
a simple span, one without intermediate supports or cantilevers, or to get the biggest simple

16
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:39,940
span out of the wood available. But span is just one of many roles relating to joists.

17
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:46,200
There are other rules for blocking, notching, and bearing lengths. And all of these roles

18
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,760
can be read alone, but when taken together and mixed with a little science, they start

19
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:57,040
to make sense, not as arbitrary roles, but as the means to reach the expected ends. Home

20
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,560
inspectors don't need an engineering degree to understand how these various joist-related

21
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,480
provisions in the code work together. So let's discuss them informally. The first step in

22
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:14,680
designing a floor system for a house is to determine how much you expect it to support,

23
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,360
and that's load. The heavier the load imposed on a joist or beam, the shorter the distance

24
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,760
it can safely and functionally span. This shortening isn't because the code is concerned

25
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:33,520
about the floor breaking. It doesn't want it to bend too much. The flexion, rather than

26
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:41,160
strength, is the foremost limiter to span in conventional wood frame construction. Maximum

27
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,960
deflection is the most a building system or component is allowed to bend under its maximum

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,200
design load. Floors have historically been held to L divided by 360, where you divide

29
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,520
the joist length and inches by 360, and you get the maximum deflection allowed for a given

30
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:05,200
span. We can refer to table R301.7 in the IRC. We can also take the internet cheese

31
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,600
free online structural issues course for home inspectors to calculate deflection of

32
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:16,640
a joist. As an example, for any 14 foot joist, the deflection limit is about a half an inch.

33
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,400
That's 168 divided by 360 approximately. The L divided by 360 deflection limit for floor

34
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,440
joists exists for at least two good reasons. One, it should prevent the drywall or the

35
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,520
plaster sealing below from cracking. It's also about how stiff the occupant expects

36
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:39,320
the floor to feel when they walk on it. While a trampoline can support the 40 pound per

37
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:45,120
square foot live load prescribed for residential living areas, it would make a rather impractical

38
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,440
kitchen floor. If more deflection than L360 were allowed, the allowable spans would increase,

39
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,200
but the floor wouldn't be as stiff. If you span less than the maximum allowed for a

40
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:03,280
given joist, it will deflect less and feel stiffer. So what gives a joist stiffness?

41
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,800
When a load is put on a joist, the fibers in the top of the joist compress, and those

42
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,320
in the bottom are under tension. And in the middle, what engineers call the neutral plane,

43
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:18,240
these forces diminish the zero. The ability of the wood fibers to resist being scrunched

44
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:24,300
by compression or stretched out by tension directly translates to how much a joist deflects

45
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,240
and is why denser wood species can span farther. They're better at resisting the stretching

46
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,760
and the scrunching, and therefore they deflect less. Still, height can make up for the deficiencies

47
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:42,400
of a species. The more mass is distributed away from the center of a joist, or toward

48
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,520
the tension and compression edges, in other words, the taller the joist, the better it

49
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,760
resists deflection. Thus a two by 10 can span farther than a two by eight of the same grade

50
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,560
in species. And this is also why eye joists can span extreme distances without a major

51
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:05,240
increase in depth. Much, if not most, of their mass is in the top and bottom flanges. These

52
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:12,400
tension and compression stresses are also what moves the load to the ends of the joist,

53
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,200
for transfer to whatever's below, typically beams, hangers, or plates. And for this transfer

54
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,240
of load to work, the joist must be held in a state of stress. A joist not stressing is

55
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:29,080
a joist deflecting. Joists will lay down on the job if permitted to, and a joist laid flat

56
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,920
like decking can't span very far without bending along its thickness. Given the way

57
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,000
houses are built, that isn't what happens. Instead, joists, especially when overspanned or

58
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
overloaded, try to flop over in the middle of the span. Joist thickness is a large part

59
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,920
of what presents this kind of flop. While the height handles the stress, the thickness

60
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:56,800
of the joist helps keep it upright and handles the stress. The ratio between thickness and

61
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,800
height is important, and most obvious in beams, where additional plies and larger sawn

62
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,840
thicknesses are common. Sawn joists on the other hand, no matter how tall, are always

63
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,840
one and a half inches thick. So even though a sawn joist can handle more stress as it

64
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,720
gets taller, it also gets harder to keep it upright. Thanks to other code provisions and

65
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:25,560
common sense, the width of the joist doesn't have to do the job alone. Blocking rim joists

66
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:31,480
or joist hangers at the ends and bearing locations are what ultimately keep the joist upright

67
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,720
and stressed. Our 502.7 in the code will help. Other than hangers, which also support the

68
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,680
vertical load, these other features do almost exclusively that. Blocking and rim joists

69
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:49,240
resist rotation. When the height of the joist compared to its width is greater than 212,

70
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,440
the width can't hold the joist upright along their length, and bridge blocking is required

71
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,720
within the span to prevent the joist from rolling over. Home inspectors are not code

72
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:06,120
inspectors, but home inspectors can get out the code book and look at the science. If you

73
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,560
want to stiffer floor with less deflection, you just need better stress management. You

74
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,360
could use larger joists height, denser wood species or closer joy spacing, or you could

75
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,520
add bridge blocking with the span to reduce mid span rotation of the joist. So let's say

76
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,120
you have a two by 10 joist that's slightly overspend. Its primary failure is excessive

77
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:34,360
deflection. And the usual reason for that is it wants to flop over in mid span. The same

78
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,960
principles that stiffen a floor to above code deflection limits can stiffen an overspend floor

79
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,000
up to the deflection limit. The code will tell you this, but we will. Bridge blocking can bring

80
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,840
slightly overspend joists to within deflection limits. And that's a more reasonable alternative

81
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:57,800
recommendation than to replacing the two by 10s with two by 12s. After deflection, shear is the

82
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,320
next stress that joists need to be able to handle. But it typically isn't a major consideration in

83
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:09,320
wood joists. Shear stresses are distributed opposite of bending stresses. They are greatest

84
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:15,560
along the horizontal center of the joist, that neutral plane, an increase towards the ends.

85
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,080
Shear failures in sawn joists typically appear as cracks that start at the ends and propagate

86
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,040
along the neutral plane. In other words, along the grain. And this kind of failure would be

87
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:32,840
problematic because two small joists aren't equivalent to one big joist. Each smaller piece

88
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:39,000
deflects more than one big one would. But it's highly unusual for a sawn joist to fail in shear

89
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,680
along its length. Shear across the grain is even rarer, if not unheard of, because of the way the

90
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:50,680
grain is oriented. It's much easier to split wood along the grain than it is to chop across the

91
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:56,920
grain, right? Research has shown joists will fail in bending long before they fail in shear,

92
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,960
which is why, despite the shear stresses being largest at the end of the joist, the IRC allows

93
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:07,800
joist ends to be notched up to one quarter of the depth of the joist. No notches are allowed in the

94
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:13,000
middle third of the joist, where the bending stresses are the greatest. And in the rest of the

95
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,080
joist, where bending stresses are smaller, they're limited to one sixth of the joist depth.

96
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,480
Holes, meanwhile, are allowed two inches away from the edges, anywhere in the span,

97
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,040
which tells you how little there is to worry about when it comes to shear stresses.

98
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,280
We also have to think about bearing. Once joists are loaded, they have to transfer the load

99
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:41,880
vertically. The key here is preventing the joist or the member that the joist is bearing on

100
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:48,840
from crushing. Wood crushes more easily across the grain, like where the ends are located,

101
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:53,560
than it does parallel with the grain, such as a post. The size of the bearing area required to

102
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:59,560
prevent crushing is directly related to the strength of the joist, what it's bearing on,

103
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:05,880
and the total load being transferred. Distributing the load over a greater area reduces the load

104
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,880
on any one point, which can in turn allow for greater loads. It's just like how

105
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:15,800
snowshoes distribute your weight to keep you from sinking in the snow. This is another engineering

106
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:23,240
fundamental the IRC simplifies. For joist bearing on wood or metal, section 502.6 of the code requires

107
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:29,320
the full width to bear with at least one and a half inches of length. This minimum area of wood

108
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,920
necessary to transfer the loads that a floor designed using the IRC's prescriptive tables

109
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:41,480
can generate without overstressing the joist and crushing its ends. The minimum bearing length

110
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,040
on concrete is three inches, but this longer length isn't about the wood, it's about the

111
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,400
concrete. A joist bearing on concrete creates stresses that can cause the corner of the concrete

112
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:57,240
or masonry to crack and spoil or break off under the joist. And the three inches of required bearing

113
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:03,640
spreads the load over a greater area to reduce the chance of spalling and leaves enough area behind

114
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:09,560
the compromised edge for the joist to bear safely if it does fall. This information was provided by
