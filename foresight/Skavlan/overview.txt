1. **Discussion on Marriage and Negotiation**: Jordan Peterson discusses the importance of effective communication and negotiation in maintaining successful marriages. He notes that many divorces occur because couples are either too vague about their desires or avoid conflict, which leads to accumulated issues over time.

2. **Irrationality and Human Behavior**: Peterson acknowledges that humans can be irrational and that this often complicates negotiations and problem-solving within relationships. He emphasizes the difficulty of rational communication and negotiation despite our understanding of scientific principles.

3. **Personal Experience with Diet and Health**: Peterson shares his family's experience with autoimmune conditions, particularly his daughter's severe symptoms that were alleviated by adopting a meat-only diet. He explains how this personal health challenge led him to also adopt a restrictive diet, which has seemed to improve his own health.

4. **Peterson's Reflection on the Interview**: At the end of the interview, Peterson expresses gratitude for the opportunity to discuss these topics and reiterates the importance of understanding human behavior, both rational and irrational, in various aspects of life, including marriage and personal health.
