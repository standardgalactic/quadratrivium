0	3000	So, 12 rules.
3000	6000	Which one do you find the hardest to follow yourself?
9000	14000	Probably the hardest one is to tell the truth, or at least not to lie.
14000	15000	Why is that?
15000	16000	It's a constant challenge.
16000	21000	Well, because it's easy to use your speech in a way that pays off in the short term,
21000	28000	and it's difficult to contend with the conflict that's inevitable if you try to do things in a straightforward manner,
28000	30000	because that produces short term conflict.
30000	34000	It produces long term peace, which is a huge advantage,
34000	42000	but it's very tempting in the short term to circumvent the problem and pretend that it's not there.
42000	47000	Do you sometimes avoid telling the truth just to be kind?
49000	52000	I try to be as kind as possible, but no.
54000	55000	Good.
56000	60000	Because I'm fundamentally an agreeable person, surprisingly enough,
60000	65000	but I'm convinced that it's better to face things when they need to be faced
65000	68000	and to get to the bottom of things, even though that's...
68000	76000	And of course you have to be constituted in that manner if you're going to be a useful psychotherapist,
76000	79000	because you can't let things go.
79000	84000	They have to be dealt with, just like they have to be dealt with if you're a medical professional.
84000	87000	It's unpleasant to tell someone that they have an illness.
87000	94000	It hurts their feelings, it upsets them, but if you don't deal with it, then perhaps they die,
94000	99000	and psychological issues can be of the same significance.
99000	104000	You talk sometimes about weak men.
104000	108000	Why are weak men such a problem?
108000	113000	Well, weak people are a problem in general, and I don't mean physically weak.
113000	118000	I mean cowardly, let's say, and deceitful, because I'm thinking it more in terms of moral weakness.
118000	121000	Well, there's a variety of reasons.
121000	127000	First of all, if you can't support your own weight, let's say, then someone else has to do it,
127000	129000	and that's not good.
129000	132000	And then if you don't make your pathway...
132000	139000	If you don't pick a forthright and useful and noble pathway through life, then you'll become bitter
139000	146000	and too hurt by the tragedy of existence, and then you tend to seek your revenge wherever you can get it,
146000	148000	and that's not good.
148000	151000	So it's a mistake on all fronts.
151000	155000	It's not good for you, it's not good for your family, it's not good for the community.
155000	160000	It's certainly not a good medium to long-term strategy, because life is very, very difficult,
160000	163000	and you have to be prepared for that.
163000	169000	I had a watcher the other night.
169000	173000	He was at my lecture in Oslo, and he wrote me a letter.
173000	178000	He was a 17-year-old boy, and he said that my work had been very helpful to him.
178000	183000	His father had died suddenly about six months before,
183000	189000	and he found his dad when he was dying, and was very, very shocked and horrified and hurt by what had happened.
189000	194000	And I had recommended on my YouTube lectures that one thing you could aim for
194000	200000	was to be the strongest person at your father's funeral.
200000	202000	And so that's what he did.
202000	207000	And he helped his mom, and he wrote a 200-word eulogy and got through it.
207000	209000	And so good for him.
209000	212000	That's strength and necessary.
212000	217000	It's a terrible thing that happened, but he did everything he could not to make it any worse than it had to be.
217000	221000	But do you never see that showing weakness can be a strength, too?
221000	226000	Not weakness. Vulnerability. That's a whole different thing.
226000	231000	To admit to the fact that you're vulnerable, that's a form of courage.
231000	233000	That's not a form of weakness.
233000	237000	But that leads you to take whatever steps are necessary to deal with that properly.
237000	239000	It isn't some facade that you're invulnerable.
239000	243000	No one is invulnerable by any stretch of the imagination.
243000	248000	And to stand up and face that is the best route that you have.
248000	251000	Why do you think so many young men are following you?
251000	254000	Because you have a lot of your own young men.
254000	256000	Because I want the best for them.
256000	258000	Genuinely. I'm encouraging them.
258000	260000	But more than you do for young women?
260000	262000	No. No, not at least.
262000	264000	So why do you think so many are young men?
264000	268000	Oh, well, I think part of it's technological fluke.
268000	272000	I mean, I came to prominence at least in part on YouTube,
272000	274000	because I put my university lectures there,
274000	279000	and it happens to be the case that 80% of the people who watch YouTube are young men.
279000	281000	So there's that.
281000	284000	And it's hard to know how to factor that in exactly.
284000	289000	But then I'm also, I think that young women are encouraged a lot,
289000	291000	which is fine as far as I'm concerned.
291000	295000	But I think that that's less true for young men now,
295000	302000	because we believe that there's something pernicious about male competence and activity.
302000	306000	It's part of a, I suppose, it's part of the notion that the best way to characterize
306000	309000	Western society is as a tyrannical patriarchy,
309000	312000	which is a appalling doctrine as far as I'm concerned.
312000	314000	How come is that?
314000	316000	Well, it's not a tyrannical patriarchy.
316000	318000	So it's not tyrannical.
318000	323000	That's the first thing, certainly not compared to any other governmental form
323000	327000	that currently exists and has ever existed.
327000	329000	And it's not essentially patriarchal,
329000	336000	unless you believe that women haven't contributed in immense part to the construction of what we have now.
336000	341000	So, and I also don't believe that to the degree that it is patriarchal,
341000	347000	that its structure is dependent on the expression of power, arbitrary power on the part of men.
347000	350000	I think that happens sometimes, but only when things go wrong.
350000	360000	What you're doing and doing now as well is challenging the idea of gender equality.
360000	367000	That is very important in Scandinavia, I think, as you probably know.
367000	373000	Why do you think that can be a problem, the idea of gender equality?
373000	376000	I don't think that equality of opportunity is a problem.
376000	381000	I think that's a great thing and that anyone with any sense champions equality of opportunity.
381000	386000	I mean, even if you're purely selfish, say, and purely self-centered,
386000	393000	you'd want to set up an economy where everyone who had ability could be maximally exploited by everyone else,
393000	396000	because then we can all benefit from each other's talents.
396000	401000	And so equality of opportunity is an absolutely useful fundamental principle.
401000	404000	But that has nothing to do with equality of outcome.
404000	407000	Those things aren't even in the same conceptual universe.
407000	412000	And to strive for equality of outcome is, well, it's a fool's game and likely to be extraordinarily,
412000	416000	it has proved to be in the past extraordinarily dangerous as well as impossible.
416000	423000	So, I mean, one of the things we know, for example, is that I don't know to what degree it's common knowledge in Scandinavia,
423000	431000	but the biggest differences between men and women in the world in terms of temperament and interest are in Scandinavia.
431000	435000	And they've maximized as a consequence of your egalitarian policies.
435000	436000	What do you mean by that?
436000	443000	It means that the more egalitarian you're state, the bigger the personality differences between men and women.
443000	446000	How do you measure that? How do you know that?
446000	452000	Oh, well, psychologists have perfected, at least to some degree, the measure of personality over the last 30 years
452000	454000	with very advanced statistical models.
454000	462000	And so what you do is you offer men and women well-validated tests of preference and of personality.
462000	467000	And you do that all across the world with tens of thousands of people in multi-country samples.
467000	470000	And then you look at the difference between men and women.
470000	475000	And then you rank order that by wealth and egalitarian social policy.
475000	481000	And what you find is the more egalitarian the society, the more different the men and women become.
481000	485000	Is this something you can recognize or is it?
485000	489000	I would say for me it's quite a simple question, actually.
489000	502000	Do we want that our sons and daughters should have the same opportunities and the same dreams or hopes for the good thing or no?
502000	505000	And for me it's simple to answer that.
505000	506000	Yes, of course.
506000	511000	So for me equality and gender equality is very, very important for me.
511000	521000	Also when we talk about gender equality, it's important for me to learn my daughter that her mom can lead and show the way
521000	525000	and her dad can hug and kiss her and show feelings.
525000	532000	And I think that's something very important for the hoods where kids grew up to show feelings,
532000	540000	to have these gender equality discussions, to show her a way of opportunities and to strive forward.
540000	551000	And it's important both for lonely men, lonely young men, but also for women that feel this roof of glass.
551000	560000	They need to fight and to struggle the roof of glass to be successful in their lives.
560000	562000	Do you agree on this?
562000	566000	I think that equality of opportunities is a perfectly reasonable proposition.
566000	568000	I mean, I have a daughter and a wife.
568000	573000	I do everything, and many, many female clients who I've consulted with and helped
573000	579000	and in many cases helped accelerate the development of their career tremendously.
579000	586000	It's obviously of great utility to encourage forward striving in young people and people in general.
586000	588000	That's not the issue in the least.
588000	596000	But why do you think the outcome, and these countries where the outcome is more equal,
596000	600000	why do you think that leads to bigger differences?
600000	603000	Because there's only two reasons that men and women differ.
603000	606000	One is cultural and the other is biological.
606000	611000	And if you minimize the cultural differences, you maximize the biological differences.
611000	614000	So I know everyone's shocked when they hear this.
614000	616000	This isn't shocking news.
616000	619000	We have known this in the scientific community for at least 25 years.
619000	624000	And it's been replicated in the last month three times in three separate samples,
624000	629000	including in Science, which is the world's greatest scientific magazine, by a large margin.
629000	632000	And it isn't a small effect. It's a huge effect.
632000	636000	Excuse me, what does it mean? Does it mean that Scandinavian men and women
636000	641000	are having more difficulties meeting each other, talking to each other than other places?
641000	647000	No, not necessarily, but it does mean that there are reasons for differences in participation rates
647000	651000	and different occupations that aren't a consequence of socialization.
651000	654000	So for example, this is especially true at the extremes.
654000	661000	So for example, on average, men are more interested in things and women are more interested in people.
661000	665000	And that's actually the biggest difference we know of psychologically between men and women.
665000	672000	And even though men and women are quite similar, all things considered, the extremes make a difference.
672000	675000	So you imagine that in order to become an engineer,
675000	681000	obviously not everyone becomes an engineer, you have to have a particular temperamental proclivity to become an engineer.
681000	686000	You have to be extraordinarily interested in things rather than people.
686000	688000	Well, most of those people are men.
688000	693000	And if you want to become a nurse, well, then you have to be much more interested in people than you are in things.
693000	695000	And most of those people are women.
695000	701000	And so you get differences in occupational choice that are also, by the way, quite great in Scandinavia,
701000	706000	especially in the case of engineering and nursing, that are mostly due to biological differences.
706000	709000	And you cannot minimize that by social engineering.
709000	712000	And it's not a bad thing.
712000	718000	Like, look, one of the things you want to ask yourself is that what is the purpose of setting up a society
718000	722000	that offers maximal equality of opportunity?
722000	725000	And one of the answers is that you maximize people's free choice.
725000	732000	And if you maximize free choice, then you also maximize differences in choice between people.
732000	734000	And so you can't have both of those.
734000	740000	But of course it will have differences in choice, of course, because we are human beings.
740000	748000	But I can't see why it differs between me and Skavelam, for instance.
748000	754000	But of course it differs in biological things, but not in choices.
754000	764000	Because I think more how we raise them, how we live, education, sort of culture, attitudes, form a human being,
764000	769000	whether or not they are a girl or a boy when they grow up.
769000	778000	And if I raise my daughter to become a leader, to be self-confident, to have a high education,
778000	784000	for instance, I think she will have a good platform to become a civil engineer, to become a CEO of a company,
784000	786000	or to become a nurse.
786000	792000	Well, that is what people who think that the differences between people who are primarily culturally constructed believe,
792000	795000	but it's not what the evidence suggests.
795000	798000	OK, we don't agree on that.
798000	803000	The other thing I should say about this, what's necessary to understand about this,
803000	808000	is this is not a contentious issue among informed scientists.
808000	811000	We've known this for 25 years.
811000	814000	And it's a perverse effect. No one expected it.
814000	819000	Why do you talk then about, you talk about chaos?
819000	823000	I mean, is what we're experiencing now chaos?
823000	826000	Your book is called An Antidote to Chaos.
826000	828000	What is the chaos?
828000	835000	Well, I think the chaos is the uncertainty that so many people feel about the meaning of life and about their position in the world.
835000	838000	That's fundamentally what I was aiming at.
838000	845000	And what I'm trying to do in my online lectures and with my book is to provide people with a guideline to meaning.
845000	853000	So one of the points that I make in my lectures, for example, is that we actually have a biological instinct for meaning that
853000	855000	orients us in the world.
855000	863000	And that instinct manifests itself when we place ourselves in a position in the world where we're competent,
863000	869000	where what we're doing is working so that we're not too terrified and anxious,
869000	875000	but also while we're simultaneously advancing ourselves and improving our ability to cope with the world.
875000	881000	So for example, if you watch an athlete, a high level athlete, who's at the peak of his or her performance,
881000	887000	you see someone who's extraordinarily practiced at what they're doing and has developed the expertise necessary to do it.
887000	894000	But then you also see them push themselves on that developmental edge to make themselves just that much better.
894000	899000	And that function is associated with an intrinsic sense of meaning.
899000	904000	And whenever you see anyone manifest that, you are automatically drawn to it.
904000	909000	You see that when an actor pushes him or herself beyond their limits.
909000	913000	You see that when someone speaks extemporaneously and manages it extraordinarily well.
913000	920000	And I'm trying to help people understand that this meaning is a true phenomenon.
920000	922000	It's not a secondary thing.
922000	928000	And also to point out that most of the time that meaning is associated with the adoption of responsibility.
928000	930000	It's also something that people don't understand.
930000	934000	But part of the chaos is that the rules are so hard to see.
934000	938000	There aren't that obvious rules anymore.
938000	944000	Well, part of the chaos is that we're transforming our landscape socially, culturally, technologically,
944000	947000	so rapidly that it's hard for people to gain footing.
947000	949000	And so it destabilizes us.
949000	964000	But isn't the real problem that quite a lot of men and also young men are struggling to deal with the fact that women now are more in control of their lives than earlier?
964000	966000	I don't think that's the problem.
966000	980000	I think the problem is that the idea that the West is a patriarchal tyranny is rapidly translated into the idea that young men who strive forward are to be regarded with suspicion
980000	987000	because they're doing nothing but manifesting the same sort of tyrannical power that has kept women oppressed for the last 2,000 years.
987000	991000	And I think that entire narrative is appalling right to the core.
991000	999000	So, and I don't see that it's helpful to anyone because making young men weak or failing to encourage them to be strong,
999000	1006000	that's a better way of putting it, certainly does the young men no good and it doesn't do the young women any good at all if they want to find a partner.
1006000	1013000	So you're saying that all along women and men have had the same opportunities always?
1013000	1018000	No, I'm basically saying that all along hardly anyone had any opportunities.
1018000	1024000	I mean, if you look at the history of the world, things really started to shift in about 1895.
1024000	1031000	But before 1895, the typical person in the West lived on less than a dollar a day in today's money,
1031000	1036000	which is about two thirds the UN cut off for abject poverty by today's standards.
1036000	1042000	And so what happened through most of the history of the world is that men and women struggled mightily together,
1042000	1049000	sometimes at each other's throats, but mostly cooperatively to keep the wolf from the door and the tyrant at bay.
1049000	1052000	Life was very, very, very, very difficult.
1052000	1061000	And the fact that we survived it all meant that fundamentally we cooperated despite the fact that we're rife with stupidity, ignorance and malevolence.
1061000	1064000	But what's so terrifying with gender equality?
1064000	1065000	Nothing.
1065000	1070000	Except when people gerrymander the data, it's like, what do you mean by equality?
1070000	1072000	Do you want women to have their free choice or not?
1072000	1077000	If you do, they're not going to pick occupations that are the same as the occupations men pick.
1077000	1081000	But we have structures today that women need to struggle.
1081000	1088000	They need to take a step to have the possibility to become like a prime minister.
1088000	1093000	As we talked before, we don't have had any prime ministers in Sweden that have been a woman, for instance.
1093000	1099000	We have a lower rate of female entrepreneurs.
1099000	1107000	Men had a higher income than women in Sweden, even if they worked with the same tasks.
1107000	1109000	That's one that I would dispute.
1109000	1117000	We need to work with gender equality, I think, even in the lower class in schools, to learn kids how to play with dolls.
1117000	1131000	I think we need to learn boys to be more sensitive, but also young girls to become more self-confident.
1131000	1133000	I think that's very important.
1133000	1144000	The problem with that is the data indicate that the consequence of the policies that you're promoting have maximized the differences between men and women.
1144000	1146000	So that isn't what it's doing.
1146000	1152000	Now, that isn't to say that the movement towards egalitarianism is necessarily a bad thing,
1152000	1156000	but a tremendous amount of that is being driven not by social policy, but by technology.
1156000	1165000	The narrative that we're fed now is that up until 1960, when the enlightened feminists developed their egalitarian doctrines,
1165000	1169000	men had kept women down and they finally rose.
1169000	1179000	The truth of the matter is that from about 1895 onward, there was a series of technological revolutions that were extraordinarily powerful in their impact
1179000	1185000	that allowed women to step forward free of many of the burdens that had kept them back in the past.
1185000	1189000	Birth control being one of them, but only one.
1189000	1198000	Sanitary facilities of all sorts, plumbing had a huge role to play, tampons had a huge role to play, as did sanitary napkins.
1198000	1208000	All of these technologies developed that enabled women to move forward with less biological impediments.
1208000	1214000	So what would you say is the best period in history to be both a man and a woman?
1214000	1218000	Oh, clearly now. There's no absolutely no doubt about that.
1218000	1219000	Anyone who would like to go back.
1219000	1222000	Well, you worry for the Kales. You worry about the Kales.
1222000	1226000	Well, you know, it's nice if we could make things better than they are.
1226000	1234000	And I would say that just as all around the world, we're raising living standards at a rate that is absolutely unparalleled in human history.
1234000	1238000	We're also in danger of destabilizing our culture in the West.
1238000	1240000	And I don't think that's a good idea.
1240000	1247000	Part of that problem you talk about there is what we call the identity politics.
1247000	1260000	Yes, I think that any political position that puts someone's group identity ahead of their individuality is a regression to a kind of a regression to a tribalism that will definitely become violent.
1260000	1262000	Because that's what happens to tribes.
1262000	1264000	What's an example?
1264000	1268000	Do you have an example of identity politics playing that role?
1268000	1269000	Yeah.
1269000	1272000	Well, it happens every time people divide themselves into tribal groups.
1272000	1280000	I mean, what we're trying to do to make peace is to bring people under the rubric of something approximating a single identity, a shared identity.
1280000	1285000	And I mean, the evidence that people fight in tribes, that's the entire evidence of the human race.
1285000	1293000	And the farther back you go in time and the smaller the tribal groups become, the higher the rates of inter-tribal warfare and the higher the rates of homicide.
1294000	1297000	And you're talking about this.
1297000	1304000	I think it's part of why people feel some kind of ambivalence towards you also.
1304000	1307000	I mean, we call it controversial from time to time.
1307000	1310000	And I don't know, do you like that being controversial?
1310000	1314000	Do you enjoy provoking groups like...
1314000	1316000	No, and I don't provoke people.
1316000	1319000	I just say what I believe to be true.
1319000	1320000	Well, that's...
1320000	1321000	No, I don't...
1321000	1322000	Have you ever been online?
1322000	1326000	I say what I believe to be true and people find that provoking.
1326000	1328000	That's not the same as me provoking people.
1328000	1331000	If I was provoking people, I would be setting out to upset them.
1331000	1333000	And I'm not setting out to upset them.
1333000	1337000	I'm just setting out to say what I believe to be true.
1337000	1338000	And I'm a very...
1338000	1341000	So you're following the rule we talked about?
1341000	1342000	Yes.
1342000	1348000	And when I'm talking about gender issues, for example, in personality, that's actually one of my fields of expertise.
1348000	1351000	I know the literature and it says exactly what I said it says.
1351000	1355000	And as I said as well, it's been replicated three times in the last month.
1355000	1364000	The London Times came out three weeks ago and said that the finding that gender differences maximise as egalitarian policies are developed
1364000	1370000	is now one of the most solidly grounded findings ever produced by social scientists.
1370000	1372000	So, you know, you can make of that what you want.
1372000	1374000	It's not something that I particularly enjoy.
1374000	1376000	It just happens to be the case.
1376000	1379000	So what are the fake news about John Peterson?
1379000	1384000	Oh, well, the fake news is one is that I'm provocative.
1384000	1392000	The other is that I have like a right leaning or a particularly conservative agenda.
1392000	1395000	And the mere fact that I oppose radical leftists...
1395000	1397000	You are a conservative at heart, aren't you?
1397000	1398000	Not particularly.
1398000	1401000	I don't have the temperament for it.
1401000	1407000	So, for example, conservative people tend to be low in trait openness, which is associated with creativity.
1407000	1409000	And I'm very high in trait openness.
1409000	1412000	And so temperamentally, I'm not much of a conservative at all.
1412000	1418000	And people who knew me, people who come to my house would certainly not think that I was a conservative person.
1418000	1427000	So, or if they saw the breadth of my ideas, I'm also very entrepreneurially minded, which also is not associated with conservatism.
1427000	1436000	I am a great skeptic of well-meaning attempts to adjust large social systems on the basis of ideology.
1436000	1438000	But that doesn't make me conservative.
1438000	1441000	It just makes me an educated social scientist.
1441000	1449000	So when are you provoked yourself?
1449000	1452000	When am I provoked myself?
1452000	1457000	Oh, being called a Nazi, I find somewhat provoking.
1457000	1459000	That I think one of the most absurd days...
1459000	1460000	I didn't do that.
1460000	1461000	No, no, certainly not.
1461000	1465000	One of the most absurd days in my life in the last two years, and there's been plenty of them,
1465000	1471000	was a day probably three months ago where I was accused by one magazine in the UK of being a Jewish shill,
1471000	1475000	and another magazine in the United States of being an alt-right Nazi.
1475000	1477000	I thought, well, that's it.
1477000	1480000	I pretty much covered both ends of the insult spectrum.
1480000	1481000	It's like, yeah, that's right.
1481000	1484000	So you can average that out to zero, I suppose.
1484000	1489000	So I find that somewhat provoking.
1489000	1498000	But you take the good with the bad, and I'm not complaining about it, but it is provoking.
1498000	1509000	Is it true that you have an opinion about people having to stay married if they have children?
1509000	1511000	Yes, it's better if they do.
1511000	1513000	It's better if they do.
1513000	1515000	It's better for the children.
1515000	1518000	Those people would agree that that's the best.
1518000	1525000	But as far as I understand, you think that the laws should say that we have to stay together.
1525000	1531000	Oh, it isn't obvious to me that the liberalization of the divorce laws in the 60s was for everyone's best interest.
1531000	1533000	Now, exactly what that means, I'm not sure.
1533000	1539000	I mean, it's okay for people to go to hell in a handbasket in their own particular means of choosing.
1539000	1544000	But we do know that stable, intact, two-parent families are better for children.
1544000	1547000	So it depends on who you put first.
1547000	1551000	And look, I'm not saying that everyone who's got divorced is reprehensible.
1551000	1559000	I understand that life is very difficult and that it's a very hard thing to maintain a relationship over a very long period of time.
1559000	1564000	But it's not obvious to me that we're better off for the additional plethora of choices.
1564000	1565000	So we'll see.
1565000	1569000	But isn't that an individual choice and not something the law should decide?
1569000	1574000	Well, it depends to some degree on whether the law should advocate for children.
1574000	1577000	I mean, children really can't speak for themselves, can they?
1577000	1579000	They need some authority to speak for them.
1579000	1590000	And so we do know, like the data, for example, on child welfare indicates crystal clear that children from intact two-parent families do better
1590000	1593000	on virtually every measure that you can possibly imagine.
1593000	1595000	So what are we supposed to make of that?
1595000	1596000	It's irrelevant.
1596000	1602000	It's like maybe the rule should be if you don't have children, then no problem.
1602000	1603000	Divorce is no problem.
1603000	1611000	But if you have children, and plus, it's not like divorce solves the problem with regards to your relationship with your ex.
1611000	1615000	It often produces a whole boatload of problems that you didn't expect.
1615000	1620000	But I'm not advocating draconian measures to keep people together who don't want to be together.
1620000	1623000	That horse has already left the barn.
1623000	1627000	Should there be an age limit on the children where you can divorce?
1627000	1631000	Well, the older the children are, the less effect it has on them.
1631000	1633000	So at some point they're not children.
1633000	1634000	What's the ideal age then?
1634000	1635000	For divorce?
1635000	1636000	Yes.
1636000	1640000	Oh, 45, something like that.
1640000	1641000	I don't know.
1641000	1644000	I don't know what the ideal age is.
1644000	1647000	What about when you were a kid yourself?
1647000	1652000	Who was your masculine role model?
1652000	1658000	Oh, I think I had a number of them, but it would primarily have been my father and some of my friends,
1658000	1665000	because peers play an important role in development, especially after the age of about four.
1665000	1667000	But I would definitely say it was my father.
1667000	1669000	And how would you describe his masculinity?
1669000	1675000	Well, to your point, he spent a tremendous amount of time with me when I was a kid.
1675000	1678000	And they're very fond memories, as far as I'm concerned.
1678000	1684000	Like when I was very young, two and three, my dad would come home from work,
1684000	1690000	and he spent an hour and a half with me a night for a long time teaching me to read,
1690000	1693000	which has been of an estimal benefit with me.
1693000	1695000	And he did many things with me.
1695000	1700000	You know, we hunted and trapped and canoed and fished and...
1700000	1702000	He was a harsh guy in many ways.
1702000	1705000	He was a disciplinarian in some sense.
1705000	1710000	But he was very honest and very good craftsman.
1710000	1720000	And so I learned a lot about trying to conduct yourself in a respectable manner from him.
1720000	1727000	Were you a tough kid, or were you a careful kid, or what kind of kid were you?
1727000	1730000	I guess it depends on what you mean by tough.
1730000	1733000	No, I don't think if you would have met me when I was a kid, you would have thought I was tough.
1733000	1740000	I'm kind of a tender-hearted character, and I was skipped a grade, and I was small for my age.
1740000	1746000	And so I certainly wasn't physically tough in the standard sense.
1746000	1750000	Because I was small and because I'd been put ahead of grade,
1750000	1756000	I was never particularly facile at sports, and that was kind of a problem.
1756000	1759000	I did something about that when I got older.
1759000	1773000	I hung around with tough kids, but that was partly because most of the kids that were in the town I grew up in were either tough kids or were sort of off the radar entirely.
1773000	1777000	And maybe that was a certain amount of compensation.
1777000	1788000	I could defend myself verbally fairly well, but that tended to get me hung up by my shirt-collar in closets and played catch with on the stairs and that sort of thing in junior high.
1789000	1800000	Is it like, do you come from an environment where weakness was a bad thing, where self-pitting was a bad thing?
1800000	1806000	Where self-pitting was a bad thing, I would say yes, I come from that background.
1806000	1809000	But that was par for the course, I would say when I grew up.
1809000	1815000	And I mean, where I grew up, it was still a frontier place in some sense.
1815000	1823000	My town was only 50 years old, and people were essentially self-reliant to the degree that that was possible.
1823000	1827000	It was certainly the case within my family on both my mother and father's side.
1827000	1834000	And the idea was, but this wasn't particularly, what would you say, unique to my family.
1834000	1840000	The ethos was, feeling sorry for yourself isn't going to be of much utility.
1840000	1843000	You should get out there and do what you can do.
1843000	1845000	And straighten your back.
1845000	1846000	Yes, if you can do that.
1846000	1849000	And I got lots of encouragement from my parents, from both of them.
1849000	1853000	Certainly, I have a very good relationship with my mother, who I love very much.
1853000	1857000	And we shared a sense of humor, which was lovely.
1857000	1869000	And my dad, although he was a harsh taskmaster, also was very encouraging to me in that he believed that I could do whatever I put my mind to.
1869000	1880000	And he helped instill that conviction in me in a manner that I hope wasn't and isn't too, let's say, narcissistic.
1880000	1885000	It wasn't a matter of privilege, it was a matter of drive and dedication and effort.
1885000	1890000	And so that was one of the things that's so sad about what I'm doing.
1890000	1894000	You know, I'm going all around the world and I'm talking to many, many people.
1894000	1898000	I've talked to about 250,000 people in the last six months.
1898000	1906000	And I offer encouraging words, you know, that people, I believe that people are stronger than their misfortunes.
1906000	1916000	I believe that if you turn around and confront the vulnerability that's part and parcel of life, you'll find within yourself a strength that will transcend that.
1916000	1920000	And I believe that not only to be true, but supported by the best clinical evidence.
1920000	1929000	And that it's important for lost young people, male and female alike, to develop a vision and take on some responsibility
1929000	1939000	and understand that they have a vital role to play in the world, that the lack of their best hurts everything.
1939000	1941000	And I think that's true.
1941000	1948000	And the sad thing is that very, there's very many people who have not heard an encouraging word in their life.
1948000	1953000	And it takes so little to encourage them that it's rather tragic.
1953000	1962000	You know, I have people come up to me and I mean all, and by all the time, I mean many people every day in the lectures and on the street who tell me.
1962000	1963000	I was in a bad place.
1963000	1964000	I was struggling.
1964000	1967000	I've been watching your lectures.
1967000	1969000	I've been reading your book.
1969000	1971000	I've put my life together.
1971000	1973000	I'm trying to be responsible.
1973000	1974000	Tell the truth.
1974000	1977000	Things are way better.
1977000	1978000	Thank you.
1978000	1983000	And so that's can't, can't get any better than that.
1983000	1987000	So, and that's, can I start?
1987000	1995000	Can I just go back to the divorce question?
1995000	2005000	What is the best situation to, to tell your children we don't love each other anymore, but we're going to stay together for your sake so that you'll have
2005000	2011000	Assemblance of a happy family life or to say, I'm sorry, this doesn't work.
2011000	2022000	We will continue to love you, but we'll part and we'll, we'll love you the rest of our lives and maybe we even can be happy on, on our different
2022000	2028000	Well, sometimes, sometimes often you have to make the best of a bad lot.
2028000	2033000	You know, I mean, sometimes the best possible choice isn't there in front of you.
2033000	2044000	And I would say, well, it's generally up to each person to decide under the circumstances which of those pathways forward would be likely to cause the least amount of misery for
2044000	2050000	Well, you know, for you, for your wife, for your kids, you know, you have to balance all of that out.
2050000	2052000	That's not an easy thing to do.
2052000	2063000	I would also say that by the time it comes to the point where you're divorce divorcing, all you may have left are one of two suboptimal choices.
2063000	2076000	And you know, so part of what I do as well is to try to lecture about what sort of interactions might facilitate a marriage such that it's less likely to end up in a situation like that.
2076000	2081000	Now, sometimes people have irreconcilable differences and there's nothing that can be done about it.
2081000	2093000	But often people are not good at negotiating partly because they don't, they won't admit what they want because then they know that, then they know if they're not getting it.
2093000	2099000	They make their criteria for failure clear and that frightens them so they keep themselves vague because they don't know what they want.
2099000	2104000	They can't communicate it to their partners and they don't know how to do that anyways because they're not very good at negotiating.
2104000	2106000	And then they avoid conflict.
2106000	2110000	And so then the conflict, because when you avoid conflict, all you do is store it up for the future.
2110000	2118000	And, you know, I've seen lots of people on the brink of divorce and in horrible marital situations, horrible family situations.
2118000	2124000	And, you know, they have 25,000 disputes that haven't been settled.
2124000	2133000	And at that point it's like maybe divorce is the best option, but that doesn't mean that it was the best option from the beginning.
2133000	2143000	So hopefully people can learn to negotiate and to tell each other the truth and that will increase the probability that they can maintain their relationships in a stable manner.
2143000	2149000	But, and I'm not, I'm not suggesting by the way that you didn't do that because I don't know anything about your situation.
2149000	2156000	But I'm a little bit surprised that you don't take into account our level of irrationality.
2156000	2158000	We're super irrational people.
2158000	2163000	When you discuss it's like we can all just agree on these things and look at the science and we'll fix everything.
2163000	2164000	That's not how it works.
2164000	2166000	Oh no, I don't think people are irrational at all.
2166000	2169000	And I think that it's very difficult for us to negotiate.
2169000	2171000	And it's amazing that we ever live in peace at all.
2171000	2172000	Yeah, I agree.
2172000	2173000	It's tremendously difficult.
2173000	2176000	So tell me one last question.
2176000	2180000	When are you irrational yourself?
2180000	2182000	When I'm hungry.
2182000	2184000	What happens then?
2184000	2189000	Little things bother me far more than they would bother any reasonable person.
2189000	2196000	So that's, and I would say if you find that you're irrational like that frequently, one of the things you might try is to eat something.
2196000	2199000	And you have a peculiar diet.
2199000	2200000	You have your own.
2200000	2202000	You could say that again, yes.
2202000	2203000	What is it?
2203000	2211000	Well, there seems to be some sort of autoimmune condition in my family and some of it's also reflected in my wife's family, unfortunately.
2211000	2223000	And the culmination of that was that my daughter had an extraordinarily serious, serious set of autoimmune dysfunctions that caused her an endless amount of misery and destruction.
2223000	2236000	And she found out about three years ago as a consequence of very, very careful experimentation that if she ate nothing but meat, then all her symptoms disappeared.
2236000	2246000	So, and her primary symptoms were degenerative bone disease that had been diagnosed as idiopathic arthritis, which means arthritis with no known cause.
2246000	2253000	And she had her ankle and her hip replaced when she was in her teens because of that and had 38 other affected joints.
2253000	2254000	So as hell.
2254000	2265000	And she caught on to the fact that diet had something to do with it for a variety of reasons I can't go into and radically restricted her eating and all her symptoms disappeared.
2265000	2267000	So that is why you do it as well?
2267000	2270000	Yes. Well, I had many, but not all of the same symptoms.
2270000	2276000	And she told, I watched what happened to her and I thought, well, that's impossible because it was.
2276000	2279000	And she encouraged me to try it.
2279000	2287000	And I thought, well, I can try anything for a month, you know, and so I started for a month and I had changes almost immediately.
2288000	2296000	And so I've continued with a very restricted diet for about two years and extraordinarily restricted for the last eight months.
2296000	2303000	So, and that seems to be working for me quite well, even though it's, you know, it has its downsides.
2305000	2308000	Jordan Peterson, it's been so interesting talking to you. Thank you so much.
2308000	2310000	Thank you very much for the invitation.
2310000	2313000	Thank you very much.
