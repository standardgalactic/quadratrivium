00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
So, 12 rules.

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
Which one do you find the hardest to follow yourself?

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
Probably the hardest one is to tell the truth, or at least not to lie.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
Why is that?

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
It's a constant challenge.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
Well, because it's easy to use your speech in a way that pays off in the short term,

00:21.000 --> 00:28.000
and it's difficult to contend with the conflict that's inevitable if you try to do things in a straightforward manner,

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
because that produces short term conflict.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
It produces long term peace, which is a huge advantage,

00:34.000 --> 00:42.000
but it's very tempting in the short term to circumvent the problem and pretend that it's not there.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
Do you sometimes avoid telling the truth just to be kind?

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
I try to be as kind as possible, but no.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Good.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
Because I'm fundamentally an agreeable person, surprisingly enough,

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
but I'm convinced that it's better to face things when they need to be faced

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
and to get to the bottom of things, even though that's...

01:08.000 --> 01:16.000
And of course you have to be constituted in that manner if you're going to be a useful psychotherapist,

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
because you can't let things go.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
They have to be dealt with, just like they have to be dealt with if you're a medical professional.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
It's unpleasant to tell someone that they have an illness.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
It hurts their feelings, it upsets them, but if you don't deal with it, then perhaps they die,

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
and psychological issues can be of the same significance.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
You talk sometimes about weak men.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Why are weak men such a problem?

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
Well, weak people are a problem in general, and I don't mean physically weak.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
I mean cowardly, let's say, and deceitful, because I'm thinking it more in terms of moral weakness.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Well, there's a variety of reasons.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
First of all, if you can't support your own weight, let's say, then someone else has to do it,

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
and that's not good.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
And then if you don't make your pathway...

02:12.000 --> 02:19.000
If you don't pick a forthright and useful and noble pathway through life, then you'll become bitter

02:19.000 --> 02:26.000
and too hurt by the tragedy of existence, and then you tend to seek your revenge wherever you can get it,

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
and that's not good.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
So it's a mistake on all fronts.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
It's not good for you, it's not good for your family, it's not good for the community.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
It's certainly not a good medium to long-term strategy, because life is very, very difficult,

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
and you have to be prepared for that.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
I had a watcher the other night.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
He was at my lecture in Oslo, and he wrote me a letter.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
He was a 17-year-old boy, and he said that my work had been very helpful to him.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
His father had died suddenly about six months before,

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
and he found his dad when he was dying, and was very, very shocked and horrified and hurt by what had happened.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
And I had recommended on my YouTube lectures that one thing you could aim for

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
was to be the strongest person at your father's funeral.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
And so that's what he did.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
And he helped his mom, and he wrote a 200-word eulogy and got through it.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
And so good for him.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
That's strength and necessary.

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
It's a terrible thing that happened, but he did everything he could not to make it any worse than it had to be.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
But do you never see that showing weakness can be a strength, too?

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
Not weakness. Vulnerability. That's a whole different thing.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
To admit to the fact that you're vulnerable, that's a form of courage.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
That's not a form of weakness.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
But that leads you to take whatever steps are necessary to deal with that properly.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
It isn't some facade that you're invulnerable.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
No one is invulnerable by any stretch of the imagination.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
And to stand up and face that is the best route that you have.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Why do you think so many young men are following you?

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Because you have a lot of your own young men.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Because I want the best for them.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Genuinely. I'm encouraging them.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
But more than you do for young women?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
No. No, not at least.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
So why do you think so many are young men?

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
Oh, well, I think part of it's technological fluke.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
I mean, I came to prominence at least in part on YouTube,

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
because I put my university lectures there,

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
and it happens to be the case that 80% of the people who watch YouTube are young men.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
So there's that.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
And it's hard to know how to factor that in exactly.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
But then I'm also, I think that young women are encouraged a lot,

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
which is fine as far as I'm concerned.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
But I think that that's less true for young men now,

04:55.000 --> 05:02.000
because we believe that there's something pernicious about male competence and activity.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
It's part of a, I suppose, it's part of the notion that the best way to characterize

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
Western society is as a tyrannical patriarchy,

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
which is a appalling doctrine as far as I'm concerned.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
How come is that?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Well, it's not a tyrannical patriarchy.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
So it's not tyrannical.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
That's the first thing, certainly not compared to any other governmental form

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
that currently exists and has ever existed.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
And it's not essentially patriarchal,

05:29.000 --> 05:36.000
unless you believe that women haven't contributed in immense part to the construction of what we have now.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
So, and I also don't believe that to the degree that it is patriarchal,

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
that its structure is dependent on the expression of power, arbitrary power on the part of men.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
I think that happens sometimes, but only when things go wrong.

05:50.000 --> 06:00.000
What you're doing and doing now as well is challenging the idea of gender equality.

06:00.000 --> 06:07.000
That is very important in Scandinavia, I think, as you probably know.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
Why do you think that can be a problem, the idea of gender equality?

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
I don't think that equality of opportunity is a problem.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
I think that's a great thing and that anyone with any sense champions equality of opportunity.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
I mean, even if you're purely selfish, say, and purely self-centered,

06:26.000 --> 06:33.000
you'd want to set up an economy where everyone who had ability could be maximally exploited by everyone else,

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
because then we can all benefit from each other's talents.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
And so equality of opportunity is an absolutely useful fundamental principle.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
But that has nothing to do with equality of outcome.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Those things aren't even in the same conceptual universe.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
And to strive for equality of outcome is, well, it's a fool's game and likely to be extraordinarily,

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
it has proved to be in the past extraordinarily dangerous as well as impossible.

06:56.000 --> 07:03.000
So, I mean, one of the things we know, for example, is that I don't know to what degree it's common knowledge in Scandinavia,

07:03.000 --> 07:11.000
but the biggest differences between men and women in the world in terms of temperament and interest are in Scandinavia.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
And they've maximized as a consequence of your egalitarian policies.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
What do you mean by that?

07:16.000 --> 07:23.000
It means that the more egalitarian you're state, the bigger the personality differences between men and women.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
How do you measure that? How do you know that?

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
Oh, well, psychologists have perfected, at least to some degree, the measure of personality over the last 30 years

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
with very advanced statistical models.

07:34.000 --> 07:42.000
And so what you do is you offer men and women well-validated tests of preference and of personality.

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
And you do that all across the world with tens of thousands of people in multi-country samples.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
And then you look at the difference between men and women.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
And then you rank order that by wealth and egalitarian social policy.

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
And what you find is the more egalitarian the society, the more different the men and women become.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
Is this something you can recognize or is it?

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
I would say for me it's quite a simple question, actually.

08:09.000 --> 08:22.000
Do we want that our sons and daughters should have the same opportunities and the same dreams or hopes for the good thing or no?

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
And for me it's simple to answer that.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Yes, of course.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
So for me equality and gender equality is very, very important for me.

08:31.000 --> 08:41.000
Also when we talk about gender equality, it's important for me to learn my daughter that her mom can lead and show the way

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
and her dad can hug and kiss her and show feelings.

08:45.000 --> 08:52.000
And I think that's something very important for the hoods where kids grew up to show feelings,

08:52.000 --> 09:00.000
to have these gender equality discussions, to show her a way of opportunities and to strive forward.

09:00.000 --> 09:11.000
And it's important both for lonely men, lonely young men, but also for women that feel this roof of glass.

09:11.000 --> 09:20.000
They need to fight and to struggle the roof of glass to be successful in their lives.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Do you agree on this?

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
I think that equality of opportunities is a perfectly reasonable proposition.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
I mean, I have a daughter and a wife.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
I do everything, and many, many female clients who I've consulted with and helped

09:33.000 --> 09:39.000
and in many cases helped accelerate the development of their career tremendously.

09:39.000 --> 09:46.000
It's obviously of great utility to encourage forward striving in young people and people in general.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
That's not the issue in the least.

09:48.000 --> 09:56.000
But why do you think the outcome, and these countries where the outcome is more equal,

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
why do you think that leads to bigger differences?

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
Because there's only two reasons that men and women differ.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
One is cultural and the other is biological.

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
And if you minimize the cultural differences, you maximize the biological differences.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
So I know everyone's shocked when they hear this.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
This isn't shocking news.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
We have known this in the scientific community for at least 25 years.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
And it's been replicated in the last month three times in three separate samples,

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
including in Science, which is the world's greatest scientific magazine, by a large margin.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
And it isn't a small effect. It's a huge effect.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
Excuse me, what does it mean? Does it mean that Scandinavian men and women

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
are having more difficulties meeting each other, talking to each other than other places?

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
No, not necessarily, but it does mean that there are reasons for differences in participation rates

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
and different occupations that aren't a consequence of socialization.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
So for example, this is especially true at the extremes.

10:54.000 --> 11:01.000
So for example, on average, men are more interested in things and women are more interested in people.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
And that's actually the biggest difference we know of psychologically between men and women.

11:05.000 --> 11:12.000
And even though men and women are quite similar, all things considered, the extremes make a difference.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
So you imagine that in order to become an engineer,

11:15.000 --> 11:21.000
obviously not everyone becomes an engineer, you have to have a particular temperamental proclivity to become an engineer.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
You have to be extraordinarily interested in things rather than people.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Well, most of those people are men.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
And if you want to become a nurse, well, then you have to be much more interested in people than you are in things.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
And most of those people are women.

11:35.000 --> 11:41.000
And so you get differences in occupational choice that are also, by the way, quite great in Scandinavia,

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
especially in the case of engineering and nursing, that are mostly due to biological differences.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
And you cannot minimize that by social engineering.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
And it's not a bad thing.

11:52.000 --> 11:58.000
Like, look, one of the things you want to ask yourself is that what is the purpose of setting up a society

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
that offers maximal equality of opportunity?

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
And one of the answers is that you maximize people's free choice.

12:05.000 --> 12:12.000
And if you maximize free choice, then you also maximize differences in choice between people.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
And so you can't have both of those.

12:14.000 --> 12:20.000
But of course it will have differences in choice, of course, because we are human beings.

12:20.000 --> 12:28.000
But I can't see why it differs between me and Skavelam, for instance.

12:28.000 --> 12:34.000
But of course it differs in biological things, but not in choices.

12:34.000 --> 12:44.000
Because I think more how we raise them, how we live, education, sort of culture, attitudes, form a human being,

12:44.000 --> 12:49.000
whether or not they are a girl or a boy when they grow up.

12:49.000 --> 12:58.000
And if I raise my daughter to become a leader, to be self-confident, to have a high education,

12:58.000 --> 13:04.000
for instance, I think she will have a good platform to become a civil engineer, to become a CEO of a company,

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
or to become a nurse.

13:06.000 --> 13:12.000
Well, that is what people who think that the differences between people who are primarily culturally constructed believe,

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
but it's not what the evidence suggests.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
OK, we don't agree on that.

13:18.000 --> 13:23.000
The other thing I should say about this, what's necessary to understand about this,

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
is this is not a contentious issue among informed scientists.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
We've known this for 25 years.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
And it's a perverse effect. No one expected it.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
Why do you talk then about, you talk about chaos?

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
I mean, is what we're experiencing now chaos?

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
Your book is called An Antidote to Chaos.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
What is the chaos?

13:48.000 --> 13:55.000
Well, I think the chaos is the uncertainty that so many people feel about the meaning of life and about their position in the world.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
That's fundamentally what I was aiming at.

13:58.000 --> 14:05.000
And what I'm trying to do in my online lectures and with my book is to provide people with a guideline to meaning.

14:05.000 --> 14:13.000
So one of the points that I make in my lectures, for example, is that we actually have a biological instinct for meaning that

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
orients us in the world.

14:15.000 --> 14:23.000
And that instinct manifests itself when we place ourselves in a position in the world where we're competent,

14:23.000 --> 14:29.000
where what we're doing is working so that we're not too terrified and anxious,

14:29.000 --> 14:35.000
but also while we're simultaneously advancing ourselves and improving our ability to cope with the world.

14:35.000 --> 14:41.000
So for example, if you watch an athlete, a high level athlete, who's at the peak of his or her performance,

14:41.000 --> 14:47.000
you see someone who's extraordinarily practiced at what they're doing and has developed the expertise necessary to do it.

14:47.000 --> 14:54.000
But then you also see them push themselves on that developmental edge to make themselves just that much better.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
And that function is associated with an intrinsic sense of meaning.

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
And whenever you see anyone manifest that, you are automatically drawn to it.

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
You see that when an actor pushes him or herself beyond their limits.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
You see that when someone speaks extemporaneously and manages it extraordinarily well.

15:13.000 --> 15:20.000
And I'm trying to help people understand that this meaning is a true phenomenon.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
It's not a secondary thing.

15:22.000 --> 15:28.000
And also to point out that most of the time that meaning is associated with the adoption of responsibility.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
It's also something that people don't understand.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
But part of the chaos is that the rules are so hard to see.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
There aren't that obvious rules anymore.

15:38.000 --> 15:44.000
Well, part of the chaos is that we're transforming our landscape socially, culturally, technologically,

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
so rapidly that it's hard for people to gain footing.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
And so it destabilizes us.

15:49.000 --> 16:04.000
But isn't the real problem that quite a lot of men and also young men are struggling to deal with the fact that women now are more in control of their lives than earlier?

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
I don't think that's the problem.

16:06.000 --> 16:20.000
I think the problem is that the idea that the West is a patriarchal tyranny is rapidly translated into the idea that young men who strive forward are to be regarded with suspicion

16:20.000 --> 16:27.000
because they're doing nothing but manifesting the same sort of tyrannical power that has kept women oppressed for the last 2,000 years.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
And I think that entire narrative is appalling right to the core.

16:31.000 --> 16:39.000
So, and I don't see that it's helpful to anyone because making young men weak or failing to encourage them to be strong,

16:39.000 --> 16:46.000
that's a better way of putting it, certainly does the young men no good and it doesn't do the young women any good at all if they want to find a partner.

16:46.000 --> 16:53.000
So you're saying that all along women and men have had the same opportunities always?

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
No, I'm basically saying that all along hardly anyone had any opportunities.

16:58.000 --> 17:04.000
I mean, if you look at the history of the world, things really started to shift in about 1895.

17:04.000 --> 17:11.000
But before 1895, the typical person in the West lived on less than a dollar a day in today's money,

17:11.000 --> 17:16.000
which is about two thirds the UN cut off for abject poverty by today's standards.

17:16.000 --> 17:22.000
And so what happened through most of the history of the world is that men and women struggled mightily together,

17:22.000 --> 17:29.000
sometimes at each other's throats, but mostly cooperatively to keep the wolf from the door and the tyrant at bay.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
Life was very, very, very, very difficult.

17:32.000 --> 17:41.000
And the fact that we survived it all meant that fundamentally we cooperated despite the fact that we're rife with stupidity, ignorance and malevolence.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
But what's so terrifying with gender equality?

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Nothing.

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
Except when people gerrymander the data, it's like, what do you mean by equality?

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Do you want women to have their free choice or not?

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
If you do, they're not going to pick occupations that are the same as the occupations men pick.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
But we have structures today that women need to struggle.

18:01.000 --> 18:08.000
They need to take a step to have the possibility to become like a prime minister.

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
As we talked before, we don't have had any prime ministers in Sweden that have been a woman, for instance.

18:13.000 --> 18:19.000
We have a lower rate of female entrepreneurs.

18:19.000 --> 18:27.000
Men had a higher income than women in Sweden, even if they worked with the same tasks.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
That's one that I would dispute.

18:29.000 --> 18:37.000
We need to work with gender equality, I think, even in the lower class in schools, to learn kids how to play with dolls.

18:37.000 --> 18:51.000
I think we need to learn boys to be more sensitive, but also young girls to become more self-confident.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
I think that's very important.

18:53.000 --> 19:04.000
The problem with that is the data indicate that the consequence of the policies that you're promoting have maximized the differences between men and women.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
So that isn't what it's doing.

19:06.000 --> 19:12.000
Now, that isn't to say that the movement towards egalitarianism is necessarily a bad thing,

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
but a tremendous amount of that is being driven not by social policy, but by technology.

19:16.000 --> 19:25.000
The narrative that we're fed now is that up until 1960, when the enlightened feminists developed their egalitarian doctrines,

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
men had kept women down and they finally rose.

19:29.000 --> 19:39.000
The truth of the matter is that from about 1895 onward, there was a series of technological revolutions that were extraordinarily powerful in their impact

19:39.000 --> 19:45.000
that allowed women to step forward free of many of the burdens that had kept them back in the past.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
Birth control being one of them, but only one.

19:49.000 --> 19:58.000
Sanitary facilities of all sorts, plumbing had a huge role to play, tampons had a huge role to play, as did sanitary napkins.

19:58.000 --> 20:08.000
All of these technologies developed that enabled women to move forward with less biological impediments.

20:08.000 --> 20:14.000
So what would you say is the best period in history to be both a man and a woman?

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
Oh, clearly now. There's no absolutely no doubt about that.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Anyone who would like to go back.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
Well, you worry for the Kales. You worry about the Kales.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
Well, you know, it's nice if we could make things better than they are.

20:26.000 --> 20:34.000
And I would say that just as all around the world, we're raising living standards at a rate that is absolutely unparalleled in human history.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
We're also in danger of destabilizing our culture in the West.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
And I don't think that's a good idea.

20:40.000 --> 20:47.000
Part of that problem you talk about there is what we call the identity politics.

20:47.000 --> 21:00.000
Yes, I think that any political position that puts someone's group identity ahead of their individuality is a regression to a kind of a regression to a tribalism that will definitely become violent.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Because that's what happens to tribes.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
What's an example?

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
Do you have an example of identity politics playing that role?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Yeah.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Well, it happens every time people divide themselves into tribal groups.

21:12.000 --> 21:20.000
I mean, what we're trying to do to make peace is to bring people under the rubric of something approximating a single identity, a shared identity.

21:20.000 --> 21:25.000
And I mean, the evidence that people fight in tribes, that's the entire evidence of the human race.

21:25.000 --> 21:33.000
And the farther back you go in time and the smaller the tribal groups become, the higher the rates of inter-tribal warfare and the higher the rates of homicide.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
And you're talking about this.

21:37.000 --> 21:44.000
I think it's part of why people feel some kind of ambivalence towards you also.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
I mean, we call it controversial from time to time.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
And I don't know, do you like that being controversial?

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
Do you enjoy provoking groups like...

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
No, and I don't provoke people.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
I just say what I believe to be true.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
Well, that's...

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
No, I don't...

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Have you ever been online?

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
I say what I believe to be true and people find that provoking.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
That's not the same as me provoking people.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
If I was provoking people, I would be setting out to upset them.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
And I'm not setting out to upset them.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
I'm just setting out to say what I believe to be true.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
And I'm a very...

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
So you're following the rule we talked about?

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Yes.

22:22.000 --> 22:28.000
And when I'm talking about gender issues, for example, in personality, that's actually one of my fields of expertise.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
I know the literature and it says exactly what I said it says.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
And as I said as well, it's been replicated three times in the last month.

22:35.000 --> 22:44.000
The London Times came out three weeks ago and said that the finding that gender differences maximise as egalitarian policies are developed

22:44.000 --> 22:50.000
is now one of the most solidly grounded findings ever produced by social scientists.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
So, you know, you can make of that what you want.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
It's not something that I particularly enjoy.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
It just happens to be the case.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
So what are the fake news about John Peterson?

22:59.000 --> 23:04.000
Oh, well, the fake news is one is that I'm provocative.

23:04.000 --> 23:12.000
The other is that I have like a right leaning or a particularly conservative agenda.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
And the mere fact that I oppose radical leftists...

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
You are a conservative at heart, aren't you?

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Not particularly.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
I don't have the temperament for it.

23:21.000 --> 23:27.000
So, for example, conservative people tend to be low in trait openness, which is associated with creativity.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
And I'm very high in trait openness.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
And so temperamentally, I'm not much of a conservative at all.

23:32.000 --> 23:38.000
And people who knew me, people who come to my house would certainly not think that I was a conservative person.

23:38.000 --> 23:47.000
So, or if they saw the breadth of my ideas, I'm also very entrepreneurially minded, which also is not associated with conservatism.

23:47.000 --> 23:56.000
I am a great skeptic of well-meaning attempts to adjust large social systems on the basis of ideology.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
But that doesn't make me conservative.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
It just makes me an educated social scientist.

24:01.000 --> 24:09.000
So when are you provoked yourself?

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
When am I provoked myself?

24:12.000 --> 24:17.000
Oh, being called a Nazi, I find somewhat provoking.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
That I think one of the most absurd days...

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
I didn't do that.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
No, no, certainly not.

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
One of the most absurd days in my life in the last two years, and there's been plenty of them,

24:25.000 --> 24:31.000
was a day probably three months ago where I was accused by one magazine in the UK of being a Jewish shill,

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
and another magazine in the United States of being an alt-right Nazi.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
I thought, well, that's it.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
I pretty much covered both ends of the insult spectrum.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
It's like, yeah, that's right.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
So you can average that out to zero, I suppose.

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
So I find that somewhat provoking.

24:49.000 --> 24:58.000
But you take the good with the bad, and I'm not complaining about it, but it is provoking.

24:58.000 --> 25:09.000
Is it true that you have an opinion about people having to stay married if they have children?

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Yes, it's better if they do.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
It's better if they do.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
It's better for the children.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
Those people would agree that that's the best.

25:18.000 --> 25:25.000
But as far as I understand, you think that the laws should say that we have to stay together.

25:25.000 --> 25:31.000
Oh, it isn't obvious to me that the liberalization of the divorce laws in the 60s was for everyone's best interest.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Now, exactly what that means, I'm not sure.

25:33.000 --> 25:39.000
I mean, it's okay for people to go to hell in a handbasket in their own particular means of choosing.

25:39.000 --> 25:44.000
But we do know that stable, intact, two-parent families are better for children.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
So it depends on who you put first.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
And look, I'm not saying that everyone who's got divorced is reprehensible.

25:51.000 --> 25:59.000
I understand that life is very difficult and that it's a very hard thing to maintain a relationship over a very long period of time.

25:59.000 --> 26:04.000
But it's not obvious to me that we're better off for the additional plethora of choices.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
So we'll see.

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
But isn't that an individual choice and not something the law should decide?

26:09.000 --> 26:14.000
Well, it depends to some degree on whether the law should advocate for children.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
I mean, children really can't speak for themselves, can they?

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
They need some authority to speak for them.

26:19.000 --> 26:30.000
And so we do know, like the data, for example, on child welfare indicates crystal clear that children from intact two-parent families do better

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
on virtually every measure that you can possibly imagine.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
So what are we supposed to make of that?

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
It's irrelevant.

26:36.000 --> 26:42.000
It's like maybe the rule should be if you don't have children, then no problem.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Divorce is no problem.

26:43.000 --> 26:51.000
But if you have children, and plus, it's not like divorce solves the problem with regards to your relationship with your ex.

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
It often produces a whole boatload of problems that you didn't expect.

26:55.000 --> 27:00.000
But I'm not advocating draconian measures to keep people together who don't want to be together.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
That horse has already left the barn.

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
Should there be an age limit on the children where you can divorce?

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
Well, the older the children are, the less effect it has on them.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
So at some point they're not children.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
What's the ideal age then?

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
For divorce?

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Yes.

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
Oh, 45, something like that.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
I don't know.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
I don't know what the ideal age is.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
What about when you were a kid yourself?

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000
Who was your masculine role model?

27:32.000 --> 27:38.000
Oh, I think I had a number of them, but it would primarily have been my father and some of my friends,

27:38.000 --> 27:45.000
because peers play an important role in development, especially after the age of about four.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
But I would definitely say it was my father.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
And how would you describe his masculinity?

27:49.000 --> 27:55.000
Well, to your point, he spent a tremendous amount of time with me when I was a kid.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
And they're very fond memories, as far as I'm concerned.

27:58.000 --> 28:04.000
Like when I was very young, two and three, my dad would come home from work,

28:04.000 --> 28:10.000
and he spent an hour and a half with me a night for a long time teaching me to read,

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
which has been of an estimal benefit with me.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
And he did many things with me.

28:15.000 --> 28:20.000
You know, we hunted and trapped and canoed and fished and...

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
He was a harsh guy in many ways.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
He was a disciplinarian in some sense.

28:25.000 --> 28:30.000
But he was very honest and very good craftsman.

28:30.000 --> 28:40.000
And so I learned a lot about trying to conduct yourself in a respectable manner from him.

28:40.000 --> 28:47.000
Were you a tough kid, or were you a careful kid, or what kind of kid were you?

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
I guess it depends on what you mean by tough.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
No, I don't think if you would have met me when I was a kid, you would have thought I was tough.

28:53.000 --> 29:00.000
I'm kind of a tender-hearted character, and I was skipped a grade, and I was small for my age.

29:00.000 --> 29:06.000
And so I certainly wasn't physically tough in the standard sense.

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
Because I was small and because I'd been put ahead of grade,

29:10.000 --> 29:16.000
I was never particularly facile at sports, and that was kind of a problem.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
I did something about that when I got older.

29:19.000 --> 29:33.000
I hung around with tough kids, but that was partly because most of the kids that were in the town I grew up in were either tough kids or were sort of off the radar entirely.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
And maybe that was a certain amount of compensation.

29:37.000 --> 29:48.000
I could defend myself verbally fairly well, but that tended to get me hung up by my shirt-collar in closets and played catch with on the stairs and that sort of thing in junior high.

29:49.000 --> 30:00.000
Is it like, do you come from an environment where weakness was a bad thing, where self-pitting was a bad thing?

30:00.000 --> 30:06.000
Where self-pitting was a bad thing, I would say yes, I come from that background.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
But that was par for the course, I would say when I grew up.

30:09.000 --> 30:15.000
And I mean, where I grew up, it was still a frontier place in some sense.

30:15.000 --> 30:23.000
My town was only 50 years old, and people were essentially self-reliant to the degree that that was possible.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
It was certainly the case within my family on both my mother and father's side.

30:27.000 --> 30:34.000
And the idea was, but this wasn't particularly, what would you say, unique to my family.

30:34.000 --> 30:40.000
The ethos was, feeling sorry for yourself isn't going to be of much utility.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
You should get out there and do what you can do.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
And straighten your back.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
Yes, if you can do that.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
And I got lots of encouragement from my parents, from both of them.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
Certainly, I have a very good relationship with my mother, who I love very much.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
And we shared a sense of humor, which was lovely.

30:57.000 --> 31:09.000
And my dad, although he was a harsh taskmaster, also was very encouraging to me in that he believed that I could do whatever I put my mind to.

31:09.000 --> 31:20.000
And he helped instill that conviction in me in a manner that I hope wasn't and isn't too, let's say, narcissistic.

31:20.000 --> 31:25.000
It wasn't a matter of privilege, it was a matter of drive and dedication and effort.

31:25.000 --> 31:30.000
And so that was one of the things that's so sad about what I'm doing.

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
You know, I'm going all around the world and I'm talking to many, many people.

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
I've talked to about 250,000 people in the last six months.

31:38.000 --> 31:46.000
And I offer encouraging words, you know, that people, I believe that people are stronger than their misfortunes.

31:46.000 --> 31:56.000
I believe that if you turn around and confront the vulnerability that's part and parcel of life, you'll find within yourself a strength that will transcend that.

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
And I believe that not only to be true, but supported by the best clinical evidence.

32:00.000 --> 32:09.000
And that it's important for lost young people, male and female alike, to develop a vision and take on some responsibility

32:09.000 --> 32:19.000
and understand that they have a vital role to play in the world, that the lack of their best hurts everything.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
And I think that's true.

32:21.000 --> 32:28.000
And the sad thing is that very, there's very many people who have not heard an encouraging word in their life.

32:28.000 --> 32:33.000
And it takes so little to encourage them that it's rather tragic.

32:33.000 --> 32:42.000
You know, I have people come up to me and I mean all, and by all the time, I mean many people every day in the lectures and on the street who tell me.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
I was in a bad place.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
I was struggling.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
I've been watching your lectures.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
I've been reading your book.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
I've put my life together.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
I'm trying to be responsible.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
Tell the truth.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
Things are way better.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
Thank you.

32:58.000 --> 33:03.000
And so that's can't, can't get any better than that.

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
So, and that's, can I start?

33:07.000 --> 33:15.000
Can I just go back to the divorce question?

33:15.000 --> 33:25.000
What is the best situation to, to tell your children we don't love each other anymore, but we're going to stay together for your sake so that you'll have

33:25.000 --> 33:31.000
Assemblance of a happy family life or to say, I'm sorry, this doesn't work.

33:31.000 --> 33:42.000
We will continue to love you, but we'll part and we'll, we'll love you the rest of our lives and maybe we even can be happy on, on our different

33:42.000 --> 33:48.000
Well, sometimes, sometimes often you have to make the best of a bad lot.

33:48.000 --> 33:53.000
You know, I mean, sometimes the best possible choice isn't there in front of you.

33:53.000 --> 34:04.000
And I would say, well, it's generally up to each person to decide under the circumstances which of those pathways forward would be likely to cause the least amount of misery for

34:04.000 --> 34:10.000
Well, you know, for you, for your wife, for your kids, you know, you have to balance all of that out.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
That's not an easy thing to do.

34:12.000 --> 34:23.000
I would also say that by the time it comes to the point where you're divorce divorcing, all you may have left are one of two suboptimal choices.

34:23.000 --> 34:36.000
And you know, so part of what I do as well is to try to lecture about what sort of interactions might facilitate a marriage such that it's less likely to end up in a situation like that.

34:36.000 --> 34:41.000
Now, sometimes people have irreconcilable differences and there's nothing that can be done about it.

34:41.000 --> 34:53.000
But often people are not good at negotiating partly because they don't, they won't admit what they want because then they know that, then they know if they're not getting it.

34:53.000 --> 34:59.000
They make their criteria for failure clear and that frightens them so they keep themselves vague because they don't know what they want.

34:59.000 --> 35:04.000
They can't communicate it to their partners and they don't know how to do that anyways because they're not very good at negotiating.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
And then they avoid conflict.

35:06.000 --> 35:10.000
And so then the conflict, because when you avoid conflict, all you do is store it up for the future.

35:10.000 --> 35:18.000
And, you know, I've seen lots of people on the brink of divorce and in horrible marital situations, horrible family situations.

35:18.000 --> 35:24.000
And, you know, they have 25,000 disputes that haven't been settled.

35:24.000 --> 35:33.000
And at that point it's like maybe divorce is the best option, but that doesn't mean that it was the best option from the beginning.

35:33.000 --> 35:43.000
So hopefully people can learn to negotiate and to tell each other the truth and that will increase the probability that they can maintain their relationships in a stable manner.

35:43.000 --> 35:49.000
But, and I'm not, I'm not suggesting by the way that you didn't do that because I don't know anything about your situation.

35:49.000 --> 35:56.000
But I'm a little bit surprised that you don't take into account our level of irrationality.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
We're super irrational people.

35:58.000 --> 36:03.000
When you discuss it's like we can all just agree on these things and look at the science and we'll fix everything.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
That's not how it works.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Oh no, I don't think people are irrational at all.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
And I think that it's very difficult for us to negotiate.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
And it's amazing that we ever live in peace at all.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
Yeah, I agree.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
It's tremendously difficult.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
So tell me one last question.

36:16.000 --> 36:20.000
When are you irrational yourself?

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
When I'm hungry.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
What happens then?

36:24.000 --> 36:29.000
Little things bother me far more than they would bother any reasonable person.

36:29.000 --> 36:36.000
So that's, and I would say if you find that you're irrational like that frequently, one of the things you might try is to eat something.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
And you have a peculiar diet.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
You have your own.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
You could say that again, yes.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
What is it?

36:43.000 --> 36:51.000
Well, there seems to be some sort of autoimmune condition in my family and some of it's also reflected in my wife's family, unfortunately.

36:51.000 --> 37:03.000
And the culmination of that was that my daughter had an extraordinarily serious, serious set of autoimmune dysfunctions that caused her an endless amount of misery and destruction.

37:03.000 --> 37:16.000
And she found out about three years ago as a consequence of very, very careful experimentation that if she ate nothing but meat, then all her symptoms disappeared.

37:16.000 --> 37:26.000
So, and her primary symptoms were degenerative bone disease that had been diagnosed as idiopathic arthritis, which means arthritis with no known cause.

37:26.000 --> 37:33.000
And she had her ankle and her hip replaced when she was in her teens because of that and had 38 other affected joints.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
So as hell.

37:34.000 --> 37:45.000
And she caught on to the fact that diet had something to do with it for a variety of reasons I can't go into and radically restricted her eating and all her symptoms disappeared.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
So that is why you do it as well?

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
Yes. Well, I had many, but not all of the same symptoms.

37:50.000 --> 37:56.000
And she told, I watched what happened to her and I thought, well, that's impossible because it was.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
And she encouraged me to try it.

37:59.000 --> 38:07.000
And I thought, well, I can try anything for a month, you know, and so I started for a month and I had changes almost immediately.

38:08.000 --> 38:16.000
And so I've continued with a very restricted diet for about two years and extraordinarily restricted for the last eight months.

38:16.000 --> 38:23.000
So, and that seems to be working for me quite well, even though it's, you know, it has its downsides.

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
Jordan Peterson, it's been so interesting talking to you. Thank you so much.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Thank you very much for the invitation.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
Thank you very much.
