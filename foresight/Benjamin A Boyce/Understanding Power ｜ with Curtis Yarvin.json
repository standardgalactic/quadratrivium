{"text": " One thing that you said during one I can't remember which one you said that you would you should write a science fiction novel But you you don't want to write fiction. You don't think that you're good. I'm not I'm not I'm not a good fiction writer Yeah, but I was thinking and Like in the style of fadress or a meal or like some sort of dialogue where you're talking to you're talking to the student You know cuz I yeah There's I mean Sure go on go on well you talk about like one of your big ideas is this this monarch But I don't I don't get a sense of who that monarch would be like what it would his character be like you talk about the system But I wonder like if you get a bad guy in the system. How do you know like from your perspective like what virtues? this this yeah, I mean I think I think people try to sort of There's a lot of Fear there and people try to sort of overplay People sort of overplay the problem which is like somewhat banal in my view I mean, you know one way to think about it is If you look at the fortune 500 companies, right? There's 500 of them because that's why it's the fortune 500 and You know the smallest of them has certainly thousands of employees And so you've got Sort of 500 men and women From that world who are experienced in holding that kind of Responsibility and if you look at their sets of like virtues and vices they're probably mostly pretty similar and You know Some of the ways I sort of regard people's kind of fear of monarchy is They sort of Imagine you're picking the CEO of Chipotle, right? And you're like first great priority is he's not gonna run Come up and with an evil scheme to like poison the burritos Because clearly he's the CEO so he could order poison put in the burritos could be a slow acting poison something right and and it's like the the executive search team when They pick the Chipotle CEO Does not really worry about we got to find someone who's not gonna poison the burritos and So like, you know, your bar is just a good bit higher than that And so, you know, I don't know who the CEO Chipotle is. He's probably fine. He's probably I mean, I guess, you know, the thing is that There are One of the ways people talk about the job in Silicon Valley is to describe the two kinds of CEOs Sort of people will say wartime CEOs and peacetime CEOs. That doesn't mean these companies are actually making war It just means that a peacetime CEO as a CEO who's Basically has something that's executing on a smooth keel and kind of needs to keep it forward Moving forward and executing sort of smoothly. So if you look like in terms of Apple say Steve Jobs is as a wartime CEO And Tim Cook is more of a peacetime CEO, right? Which is not to say that he's not making tough decisions or tough choices every day, but he's not really You know someone that you would want in there if their mission was to like entirely change what Apple is and so To a certain extent when you're establishing any kind of a new regime, that's a kind of wartime situation and so You need someone that's a very very dynamic. That's willing to like rip up a lot of pieces of paper and like a no say or a naysayer like somebody Yeah, like or yeah, I mean, but even even you know, I would you call even must Elon Musk You know a naysayer, you know, Elon Musk is someone with a lot of initiative who basically can make things happen and You know the role of a peacetime CEO is sort of more to like preside over something that's working Smoothly, which is why if you put someone like that in a position where large changes need to be made You don't really have the right person But you know the thing is that it's just not like we sort of A company the job with this like mystical air in some ways and it's actually It's a you know governing is or should be a pretty banal thing It's like it's gotten sort of a lot of like you know Very big romantic ideas associated with it and there's a lot of power there There's there's a lot of power there, but but the thing is that you know when when you when you have mechanisms for putting someone in that power that basically sort of depend on Like a kind of Certain like if the sort of the main Problem with a lot of the A lot of 20th century governance has a very high crazy level and when you look at basically the very high crazy level of 20th century governance you basically see that There are crazy incentives Driving the way that people both get to make these decisions and crazy incentives driving them when they're making these decisions and Normally, it's best to see like the People who wind up in those slots as kind of Their craziness is in general constructed by those processes or those You know sort of like their hands are sort of tie. Yeah, the climate or the structure their hands are sort of tied in terms of how saying they can be and I think that people think of like sort of Like people have been exposed to so many Romantic ideas of governance that they don't Really even have an idea of what sanity is I mean, what is sanity for example for the CEO for an organization like Tesla for an organization like Ford? There's a whole bunch of constraints that sort of immediately tie you To a vision of the same, you know Tesla is not gonna go out and Invade the island of Haiti and like, you know Re-enslave the Haitians and set them to making sugarcane. It's just not that is not going to happen That is not within the realm of like saying things that Tesla could do Tesla is not going to say Tomorrow we're gonna take over the dental floss business We're gonna become the kings of dental floss like they're not gonna do this and and so when you're in sort of like a System and a structure that defines what sanity is whether you're Elon Musk or Elizabeth the first or Louis the 14th You have like it's sort of It feels like this much less sort of open-ended kind of crazy problem of like Oh, we're gonna go crazy and invade the moon or like, you know, and and there's there's like there's a lot of things that Washington does every day that are as crazy as invading the moon and when you look at the way Those crazy things happen It's not because of one or two crazy people actually generally the people involved in these things are like very sensible and very good and very You know Yeah, practical down-to-earth people Team players, you know, they're just basically in a system that makes them make, you know, crazy decisions I mean for me the COVID thing because I'm a you know, believer in the in the lab leak theory of COVID is such a perfect sort of case of like We're gonna have these crazy incentives that basically leave us doing this extremely dangerous gain-of-function research in this very very risky and unsafe way and the Because there's the government has taken on too much problems like with the company like Tesla They have a very specific mandate and with the government. It's so open-ended. Is that where the craziness or the stochastic chaos is coming? That's giving rise to these crazy ideas and behaviors. The the Like I mean, you know Even the question of what the mission of government is which seemed very obvious and very straight-forward Sadie the Elizabethans has taken on all this sort of Chili-astic and messianic kind of you know overtones I mean even when you look at for example when you dive into Say a question like foreign policy, it's sort of dubious as to whether There's sort of ever been any clear sanity guiding us foreign policy I mean if you go and look for example at Washington's farewell address Which you predict, you know the farewell address I Could but I'll just I'll just summarize it You know his farewell address is sort of he's like reminding Americans that their foreign policy should be conducted in the you know The interests of America and it's that he's expressing it's it's one of the expressions of kind of what is sometimes called isolationist foreign policy and he's basically Sort of painting this picture very 18th century picture of a kind of wise approach to foreign policy and You know, this is all very well, but you sort of read it and you're like Why do you have to say this and the reason he had to say this and warned against basically sort of being pulled into the quarrels of others and Is that already? Basically many Americans including the Americans who didn't really disagree didn't really agree with George Washington too much We're very very eager to basically see the United States become the kind of world home base of revolutionary politics And so right away you had this, you know, we've always been dreamers then or at least there You had this incredibly wacky event with this guy's citizen Jenae who was the the French Revolutionary Ambassador to the US and basically Made him made such a news made himself such a nuisance that he actually got kicked out was but was basically sort of proceeding on this plan and The level of like support for the French Revolution Even as sort of at its most Sanguinary days Was you know, you'll have all these lines from Jefferson where he's like the tree of you know The tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of tyrants or like shit like that You know where he's basically like, you know, he's like, ah, you know, he reacts to this insane shit in France where he's been right by you got to kill a few people everyone's alright, you know, it's kind of creepy, right, you know and and distinctly reminiscent of American sympathy for Stalin or for, you know, the Russian Revolution I mean in 1848 there's this Of course outright, you know sort of outbreak of almost what we would now call color revolutions across Europe and This one character in Hungary this guy to soothe becomes the liberal leader of Hungary Is then chased out by, you know, the Russian Russian troops help the Habsburgs reinstall themselves Kuthu Kuthuth gets chased out and he becomes this massive public celebrity first in London and then in America Where basically people are doing exactly the same thing with sort of the Hungarians in 1848 that they're doing say with the Ukrainians now They're basically found, you know, they're sort of doing exactly what Washington was telling them not to do They basically found the sort of foreign quarrel developed an emotionally interested and picked a side and like, you know gone bananas over it. Do you think that has something to do with our culture then that we like to Kind of embosom the world or we find a conflict that doesn't necessarily have to do with us We just identify with that Yeah, it's like a sick Laticatorial, you know reflex. It's like if you remember the Arab Spring, right? You were probably excited about the Arab Spring That was the bipartisan, you know, excitement. Everyone was excited about the Arab Spring and that's cool The internet was doing it making waves, you know, Twitter. Yeah, I know I know I know I know and and this is like yeah Twitter and Facebook were and you remember like Google guy in Egypt, right? You know and that movement wind up killing about 500,000 to a million people It did not cause the Civil War in Egypt, which it almost did which certainly would have killed a few more million people It devastated Syria and Libya And it was like it was sort of funny watching, you know, sort of the American Democratic governance machine in a situation where Public opinion and the deep state are really sort of completely aligned and we feel that we're doing this very clearly unambiguously good thing and then it just results in just like horror and disaster as usual and the The response of people There's sort of one test I use for like sanity in that situation Which is kind of a good Samaritan test and if you're really acting as a as a good Samaritan in this case, let's say you You're walking down the street and you see your horrific motorcycle accident And you're the first one on this scene you run over to the guy. He's lying there in his motorcycle helmet. You like take his helmet off Don't do that you made a mistake Do not move the helmet of someone who's had a motorcycle accident because it turns out that you just broke his neck And or he broke his neck, but you broke his spinal cord and paralyzed him for life. Let the MTS handle that one Right, but you didn't right? You were trying to be nice You were trying to help but you basically just inflicted this Horridous life-changing thing on these people, right? And so if you're basically doing that with the sort of the true spirit of charity and altruism You're gonna be pretty beaten up about that. You're gonna think hard about wow I was trying to help but instead I inflicted this crazy level of damage and You would definitely never do something like that again and But we don't as a country we work but with Arab Spring it was like, oh, this didn't work out. It's too bad Let's change the channel, right? You know and so there's this sense of like sort of Deranged and irresponsible like power in a sense running free, you know, it's like when you compare say Libya or the Libyan revolutionaries in 2012 or whenever it was to sort of foreign policy of the past the thing that it instantly reminds you of is say the Spanish-American war or Say the reunification of Italy by Garibaldi Garibaldi certainly reunified Italy with his like 300 red shirts or whatever but That was a reconquer the kingdom of the two Sicilies with this 300 red shirts Which was possible only because he had the British Navy right offshore declaring basically a no-sale zone Whatever the equivalent was at the time, right? So it was this sort of act of kind of somewhat naked Imperialism and the result was a new unified Italy which was to some extent a British client state Which offered a lot of new commercial opportunities to British merchants. You look at the Spanish-American war It has all of these like, you know all this liberal rhetoric about how you know in the yellow press about how you know The evil Spanish generals are abusing, you know fetching Cupid maidens and so forth They really laid it on extremely thick and and like just like at a level of like blatancy. That's just utterly comical today But on the other hand So it was sort of this kind of high point of like liberal imperialism or like an attack on a foreign power That was basically justified by sort of liberal thinking on the other hand This liberal thinking resulted in basically the acquisition of Cuba the Philippines and Puerto Rico Say what you want about Puerto Rico, but these are valuable properties basically and we're treated as valuable properties and Returned much to like American colonialist investors and the United Fruit Company and so on and so forth And so you basically look at that sort of liberal imperialism and you're like, okay There's something predatory here clearly You know from the perspective of Spain there's something very predatory going on here on the other hand like What? the US in 1898 killed it ate and So it was like a dog like there's something ugly about it and there's something beautiful about it It's like a wolf hunting a deer, you know, like, you know, this is only gonna end one way You know, the wolf was gonna take down the deer and then the wolf was gonna eat, right? And the thing is when you look at sort of the liberal imperialism of today It's like It's like a dog killing sheep Like there's an instinct to like take out Gaddafi. There's an instinct to take out Assad It feels great to have wheeled Obama and put it something on his teleprompter where he's like Assad must go Boba bark must go Gaddafi must go People understate the sort of power of American self-power to the point where if you will to bomb it out and had him say like Merkel must go you could probably start a civil war in Germany that way Just by just by basically saying we remove the moral authority from this regime that we have established and If you basically yeah, I mean you could you know amazing things are possible with that shit But This liberal retric or this this liberal facade of generosity of caring is always hiding some sort of power play Or you can't separate those two would it be better to just like it's like can't it can't it's an interesting question It's like it's hiding It's not really an absence of Sincerity it's that it's sort of it's a thing that the sincerity kind of doesn't know itself And so people think that they're genuinely sincere that what they're sort of doing is Caring but what's actually sort of driving them and driving the structures there is Something where when the effects of the caring are extremely bad and counterproductive There's no caring about that So in a way, it's like it's something that really wants to think of itself as kind of a duty of care but you can also read it as this like perverse gladiatorial fascination and You know this thing of like We're using Ukraine to weaken Putin and we're gonna like fight to the last Ukrainian I mean, it's like if you think you're doing a good thing for Ukraine Excuse me the Ukraine here. If you think you're doing a good thing for the Ukraine you're already Several hundred yards Behind the goal line here Like many bad things have already happened to Ukraine the Ukraine as a result of this policy Of arming it to like basically as an anti-russian power So you might say we're gonna get the 300 yards back and we're gonna get back to our own 20 But you've got you're you're not even in the stadium right now in terms of the damage you've inflicted on this country and You would say well the Ukrainians are into it. Well, yeah, I mean like The Jedi mind powers of like the american cosmopolitan ruling class Are extremely great and If we went past sort of our current Enthusiasm's into like Some kind of full-on jim jones suicide cult I feel like a lot of the chic people in Warsaw and Kiev and levove would be committing suicide as well I think that's sort of how powerful that kind of fashion dominance is in a way and so and that was certainly the case with the kind of tiny fringes of sort of liberal elite who Were very into the arab spring. Also. It's like wow civil society in libya or civil civil society in egypt is going to get a huge boost Um, and they didn't but you could see where they were sort of coming from with that and so that we just like with I don't know. I don't want to get into european History or something, but I'm just thinking we inflict that on ourselves through Wokeness or dei training It seems like with the black lives matter event like the liberal Cosmopolitan elite was all on board with defunding the police. We're going to liberate these These these areas of our own country and now those areas are completely decimated by yeah, all of them Well, I mean, yeah, I mean it wasn't rhetoric doesn't actually translate into hoping it wasn't I mean it wasn't the first time I mean if you look at basically 60 years ago Every major american city Had like a thriving black business district. It had a thriving black upper class residential district You know in those areas of general are burned out now and that was basically something that happened in the late 60s and early 70s and You know the connection between that and the civil rights movement which Americans saw on their TVs and supported with great enthusiasm seems to be sort of rather Direct in a way And so you're basically again Looking at something where if you're like Wow Let's say i'm like flying a drone over urban african-american areas In like 1962 and 2022 what i'm going to observe with my eyes is that these areas have been like decimated and so I would basically assume that Sometime in the 60s some kind of radical anti-black party had come to power Maybe the klu Klux Klan had won the election in 68 and that would explain why these areas had been systematically destroyed Right and that's not indeed what happened. You know what happened was actually the opposite of that what happened was that basically A set an aspect of america that hadn't gotten a whole lot of attention or sympathy Or this or you know empathy you might say Receive that and the result of this emotion was seemed to be and you know just to A physical observer of the people in the places Seems to be a great deal of destruction and the mentality of Like our intentions are good our hearts are pure and so we don't really have to think about The destruction that we're causing or the destruction that results here is not The way that people whose hearts are pure think And so at no point under any of these examples to the people who are taking off the bike helmet Actually have to deal with the severed spine or recognize that they're at fault for doing that It doesn't seem yes. That's capable or the system itself There are the liberal There's culture just can't see they're they're they're motivated by like there's something that is very similar to empathy and sort of easily Masquerades as it but like drives out the real thing. It's like a kind of gresham's law where bad money drives out good bad empathy drives out good empathy And so, you know, one of the ways to think about well, you know, you're like, what is this bad empathy? What is this thing that is like empathy, but is not empathy and It reminds me of this etymological fact that I love that I always quote, which is the etymology of the word lord Lord is an old anglo-saxon word and it comes from cloth ward Which means the cloth is loaf as in bread And the ward is ward is in guard as in basically so your lord is basically he who guards your bread he who gives you this day your daily bread and If you're feeding someone you basically are his lord because even if you don't care to tell him what to do you could And you could say if you don't do this, I'm not gonna feed you and so the sort of, you know, basically the sense that you have of like Caring for others is like closely entwined with the sense of being lord over them and You know, certainly as a parent like you feel that very closely like the the sort of the care and the dependency Are all very much tied together and so in a way when people adopt these sort of, you know The mindset that supports these kinds of foreign policies, they sort of Acquiring or domestic policies. They're sort of acquiring clients in a way They're sort of feeling themselves become more powerful Because they're feeling themselves owning others by caring for others it's it's actually it's represented on twitter the people who put ukraine flags in their bio are kind of claiming ukraine as their own in a way They're claiming ukraine as absolutely. They're claiming ukraine as their as their position and they don't really understand Yeah, as their vassal state, right, you know, and they sort of don't understand like because they've sort of only been exposed to Imperialism as a caricature They don't really understand how close this is to The way that actual imperialists thought And so yeah, white man's burden kind of classic. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah white man's burden, right? And so basically you know, they're they're taking up the You know, the the the white man's burden when they put the ukraine flag in their In their thing, I mean, you know, of course raises the question of whether slobs are white But um, you know, we don't we don't have to go into that Add the mulligy of slave if you want to hey, there you go. There you go. Right, right, right, right? And now it's like they wear these track suits. They have this like squat, you know the I mean, you know, I don't know if you know that like some of the rhetoric, you know, the sort of ukrainian russian rhetoric is absolutely Deranged and the word more deranged than our blue red rhetoric Yes, because the slur that ukrainians have picked up on that they Used for russian is orcs Literally orcs. They stole it from tolkin, right? And so they basically think of them as like subhuman creatures from the east And and one of the things that triggered the original revolt in the donbas in 2014 Was basically as soon as the kind of western ukrainians got control of the ukrainian state They started passing all of these like anti russian laws Like you have to like not speak russian and like change your name to like the funny looking ukrainian spelling And you'll see pictures on yes, so they did a cultural genocide Yeah, that's a strong genocide It's basically yeah, it's the sort of thing that basically you do to a cultural, you know minority that you basically want to kind of You know bring into line, you know, you could compare it if you were feeling generous to like the way That like northern france treated southern france like 500 600 years ago, right, you know, and and and it's like the And and so you'll see pictures one of the old folk punishments or whatever which gets used a lot In ukraine is tying people to trees And so I don't know if you go around you'll see in twitter people tied to trees or telephone poles And sometimes their faces have been painted green to show that there are orcs Um, this would be like I don't think that like Speaking russian is not going to do that but like basically you're being accused of being a russian sympathizer So it's just this like, you know, you go into like the inside of this war and there's just like insane shit everywhere, right? You know and and needless to say the people with ukrainian flags in their in their twitter handles Would probably never tie anyone to a tree and paint their face green for speaking the wrong language But like that that was probably not really in their like bag of tricks Like at all really but like that's sort of what they're When they basically sort of picked sides in this like nationalistic Balkan basically fight I'm sure all all ukrainians would be insulted by my use of the word Balkan But you know the the like, you know, you're just doing this like There's this level at what Where what you're doing is this kind of Gladiatorial spectator thing and like to like sort of step sort of all the way back, right It's like when You know, you look at the foreign policy that's driven this where you know, there were these constant promises made to like not expand NATO And then it's like, oops. Sorry. It looks like we're expanding NATO, right, you know and the like the sense of A driving force behind this kind of foreign policy Which is not in any way the force of reason Is like you're just like it's sort of it's just like power is flowing Into wherever it wants to go and it's sort of reminiscent There's a lot of this kind of foreign policy that's like very reminiscent of the frog in the scorpion, right? where basically it's just sort of The nature of this whole system, which includes both the bureaucrats who run it and the sort of supporters of it who basically like Have these incentives to basically cause trouble and create problems And they don't see it that way. That is not their framework. They're basically Trying to like create freedom, but their sense of freedom is basically they see one stone on top of another And they're like we must liberate the stone on the bottom And so, you know, sort of freedom is kind of becomes indistinguishable from a kind of like destruction and so You look at basically the like things that like When you compare for example, afghanistan to vietnam you know, basically The first of all afghanistan is run by people who's like Formative experience was the lessons learned from vietnam And just in terms of like age cohort. They didn't seem to learn any lesson at all and like vietnam afghanistan makes vietnam looks sane and Like it made vietnam looks sane. It was just like all of us. We're never gonna get the you know full metal jacket movies It's never gonna be romanticized or yeah. Yeah, and and there's no like, you know It's like when you look at sort of for example Like the reality of the south vietnamese government is like much realer than the afghan government Like the level of like, you know Sort of just like everything about Vietnam you can sort of find ways to look at the vietnam effort where you're like, okay, there's certain ways Ultimately in the end this didn't make sense and it didn't work But you can kind of see Here are things that made sense that like this was maybe like close to And you can't even find out for afghanistan and so you have just like all of these things whether it's like invading afghanistan and Trying to like, you know for 20 years. We're there for spending 20 years in this comical ridiculous ineffective attempt to turn it into vermont or something And maybe we would have been happy with florida Maybe we could have been happy. Maybe we could have been happy with oklahoma Maybe we could have been happy with guam, but no, you know, we needed we needed the vermont concept of you know The bennington concept of human rights, you know, and and and like and so, you know We had all these bennington grads going and teaching like, you know, very, you know In gender rights, whatever Poetry workshops, right, you know, exactly and and um nothing wrong with a good poetry workshop But you know like everything has its place and and the I mean they love they love I mean in the taliban actually writing Poems is like a qualification for leadership, right? But is it is it? It is it is it is a very good volume There's a yes, there's a volume of like translated taliban poetry. That's actually not too bad if you're into it's all of course From a taliban perspective, right? You know, it's not really Not really gonna appeal to the It's like there's this there's this other great book that i'm a huge fan of um called zen at war Which was written by like a california hippie zen dude like in the 80s or 90s or something where he realizes that All of these zen masters many of whom came over to like california because they smelled a good thing and like After you know the 40s 50s 60s, but in like the 30s and 40s these guys are in japan They're in imperial japan, right? So he's like what is zen like? um In imperial japan and he basically finds all these like and he just quotes these things with it's just the outrage where they're just like, you know The feeling of zen is the feeling of a chinese soldier's head trapping from his body as the perfect swords like i mean, right, you know And like, you know, there's just you know, nothing is more zen than the mom that are killing right, you know or and It just reminds you of the sort of protean nature of this religion which can be sort of like california hippies and and you know imperial desk wads, uh, you know equally well and and and I'm sure these zen and tally bone the tally bone. Yeah, right. And so yeah, there's definitely I mean there's something poetic and beautiful about martyrdom operations or whatever you want to call it Well, or you have to have a poetic sense of Reality in order to sure I mean, and you know, you listen you listen to isis videos. They're all like, you know, nashid's Which are um, you know acapella singing that, you know, uh, salafi islam's like, okay, you can have music But no instruments. Yeah, so you have these basically nashid's which are like Sort of the taliban al qaeda equivalent of like the narco corrido If you know that mexican genre like the drug drug narco music from northern mexico Like that celebrates like, you know, the the achievements of great drug lords Um, and they have that for basically martyrs and so forth. And I mean, it's it's beautiful Anyway, there's this very good volume with have translated taliban poetry, but um, Yeah, you know, definitely like feminist poetry workshops are not really the thing It's gonna turn kandahar into into bennington And and so you basically, you know, they had their chance, right? You know, if it was gonna work, it was gonna work. It probably would have worked by now And and so when we basically, um Kind of pull the camera back and we look at basically Just like the level of just weird insane shit That dc does that nobody even thinks about like how weird and insane it is You're at a like, you know, people will be like, well, the u.s. government's lorotic and, you know, slow and bumbling and bureaucratic But so is ibm. I'm like, yeah, okay. Yes. ibm is like this, but like Waters of magnitude my friends, like, you know, like and and so they're just like whole You know, it's like another great dc example is you remember 9 11 probably Looks like you were a little younger than me at that time. But um, they came up they came up with this You're you're looking good. Um, the um, um The the keeping that brown hair is very important He got great locks too. Yeah. Yeah, as soon as as soon as I start getting bald. That's all coming off But um, I will not be one of those people but you know, the um, it's good a good hat Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, right. Um, but just like the the sheer like The will like the the sheer like the yeah, I mean the example I was thinking of is that So we have this term national security that was basically It's a world war two term and what was decided, you know, basically I think there's this line from roosevelt where he's basically like Any political events anywhere in the world are relevant to us national security. This is basically this isn't the second Yeah, this is this is franklin, right? And so basically it somehow came about that basically part of the american kind of political Creed became that to keep america safe. We have to rule the world But you say even washington even george washington had already noticed that that is our tendency There's something and exactly the way we look at the world is that there's something there's this sort of weird Yeah, there's this weird vicarious like hunger That basically becomes People really don't feel it as the will to dominate it But it becomes the will to dominate and then it's sort of that will to dominate Enter as all of these institutions and become sort of part of the unconscious Creed of these institutions And then the us is actually attacked in 2001 And so Then they have to come up with this term homeland security Which means national security but not national security because that word is already taken, right? And so they come up with this weird nazi sounding term homeland, right? You know homeland, right? At least it's genderless, right? At least it's genderless, right? You know haimath, right? You know and and it's just like it's it's and and you're like you would say national security except that word is already taken For meaning something which it doesn't mean, right? And so you have all these incredible like distortions of like There are all these convoluted ways of thinking that are sort of spread to the population from You know these assumptions that are hidden deep in our these assumptions that are sort of came out of some weird Historical structure that get embedded in everything. You know, it's sort of like the You know the I think people have traced like the six foot social disc both the six foot social distancing thing And the paper straw thing and people have been like where did this come from? And they actually found like high school science projects That were basically the source of this shit, right? You know and and like it doesn't matter anymore But you still have all you know all these circles on the floor where there's six feet social distancing thing Which is absolutely and utterly and profoundly unscientific as like, you know, I mean it took these these just In like the specific area of the WHO Had this bias for bizarre historical scientific reasons Against thinking of viruses as airborne, right? And so you basically had this where the six feet comes from was this whole like droplet theory Which was shown to be completely incorrect like which never made any godium sense And was shown to be completely incorrect very early in the pandemic And it took WHO like a year and a half to be like well, I guess maybe it might be airborne, right? Meanwhile in japan, they're like, okay, you know, like better ventilation is like the solution here because it's obviously airborne Right and they had some sort of native bureaucracy there which could kind of make up its own mind But the mindset's the point is that basically when you're looking at the way this system does government it has embedded in it a lot of Extremely bizarre assumptions. Okay. It's like it's like it's like English language where you have these weird words that are just floating around That mean nothing like what they what they came from or yeah, or just something strange conjugations like the oxen, you know, and you're just like you can go in the past and you can say oh well this came from The dynamics of world war two or like this came from like somebody's high school project about plastic straws, you know and watch like how I mean, I guess my sort of point going back to your original question about monarchy is that Sort of people are always like they sort of believe in the wisdom or not even the wisdom But like the sanity of crowds and they're like One person could be completely mental and start poisoning the burritos or doing them, you know um And then but if you have like a community of the smartest best people making the decision Like how could that go wrong? Like who? Why should like some king who however he was chosen? Maybe he was just born to be king like and he's making the decisions about virology Shouldn't the virologist make the decisions about virology and like, you know The idea that the virologist should make the decisions about virology seems extremely logical and sensible a confederacy of experts is what we Yeah, I want and it eventually gets you to covet 19 because it basically Creates incentives in within that network of experts where They basically are in a position position to say well We need funding to do our work Um, the more important we are the more funding we get Therefore it is important for us to find important emerging threats which could be threatening So let's basically go and collect all the bat viruses while these bat viruses can't you know Normally infect people because they're bat viruses, but what if they mutated to jump to humans? That would be very dangerous and scary Um, let's examine how they could mutate to jump to humans Uh, well, how could we do that? We could just create some Examples create some examples, right? You know and and basically you're just like not, you know, um Realizing in the process of this process of this that you're doing exactly what the like Dr. Chernobyl did when he's like we got to figure out if this nuclear reactor is safe Our theory is that if we turn off all the safety systems and run full power We'll still be safe, right? You know and and and like that's basically what you're doing when you collect these guiding bat viruses, right? And and like so Scientists aren't adapted to power power adapts scientists to itself So so scientists are focused on on on making science or even even trying to Solve a problem with regards to health But power itself exerts a shape onto how the science Happens and what what decisions each end up coming out of and it mutates And it mutates the culture of science eventually and so basically to become We think of scientists as these people driven by pure curiosity puttering around in their labs Like some, you know, 19th century like, you know, vicar or something that or alchemist studies studies beetles under a microscope, you know, and That person is driven entirely by their curiosity and wonder and lefren And these are the things that cause people to get into science But the thing is is once you're in science you discover that it's just actually like Very very cut through a bureaucracy and you have to basically be A good operator in that bureaucracy and the people Who turn out to be the best at that are often somewhat mediocre scientists and really world-class bureaucrats And so you basically sort of everything kind of gets twisted in this direction Of like Yeah, I need to justify my importance and the thing is Most fields are not such that You can actually create the problems that you're there to solve but like A virus that goes around the world and kills. Yeah, virology is kind of an exception to that And so basically these people were, you know, it's like the the classic dc example is the self-licking ice cream cone Right, but this was like a toxic self-licking ice cream cone It's like a self-licking ice cream cone is like A something whose solution only exists to like solve itself like, you know Like you don't even get the lick the ice cream that licks itself, right, you know But but in this case it was a toxic self-licking ice cream cone and you look at basically The bureaucratic incentives Which caused that To happen or I think caused that to happen because why would there be such a cover-up when there was nothing to cover up? right and the Yeah, if reputation didn't matter nobody would have to lie Yeah, right and and and there's clearly Yes, there's clearly some bad dealing there and like obviously nobody involved in this research wants to admit that this is what happened right and And so in every instance It's it's power that's directing everything Whether it's it's under the guise of saving the world from this problem or liberating this country over here There's always power eventually is always operating under the surface because that's eventually what Happens is and power and power power corrupts things and so basically when you had I mean the way we got to give sort of academic models of policy So much power in the 20th century is we started the 20th century in a world Where power was largely actually held by corrupt politicians And that like gilded age country worked a lot the like the way china works today in some ways It wasn't a dictatorship But it was a country in which everything was very very corrupt and was done very quickly in this ugly way power was directed Specifically toward not necessarily the common good, but doing a work, right? It wasn't directed It was something more solid perhaps it had a kind of corruption I mean the kind of corruption that existed there Or exists in china today was like If the street gets built it may be cost 30 percent more than it should have cost But it does get built um and but like the level of um you know There was also like there was yeah, and and so what happened early in the 20th century was sort of the beginnings of what we call the progressive movement at that time was that basically america's hereditary aristocracy looked at this stuff and basically saw that people who were Dumber and less sophisticated than them were in charge And like this is where we get, you know, one of the things I love to cite is this bizarre Sort of disconnect between You know, we have if you think about the two words democracy and politics You'll notice that democracy has very very positive connotations and politics has very very negative connotations but they're actually synonyms And like how do you have politics without democracy or democracy without and specifically I've heard you say this but What helped me understand it better was when you talk about populism is basically yeah, right or between democracy politics is populism which populism is kind of a synonym for like putting politicians in charge and putting politicians in you know who Appeal to like what the public wants in charge Is literally the meaning of representative democracy? and so one of the things that basically The progressive movement did is it said we're going to treat representative democracy sort of the way The modern uk treats its monarchy. We're going to still have these elections, but we're going to make sure That basically it's really traditional and important and constitutional and necessary For the president to not really be in charge of the executive branch Because if the president is like can tell doj who to prosecute like yeah, my god, right? You know and so it's like saying queen elizabeth the second could say off with her head, right? You know elizabeth the first could be like off of his head, but like elizabeth the second like In theory she has the same job, right? But in practice it's very very different and so So the aristocracy re-exerted itself or the which would be the oligarchy Or yeah, right right and sort of created this kind of institutional oligarchy You know the word meritocracy has been used Is that is that a cynical take meritocracy? That's a whole other discussion It was originally in the in the original book by michael young It was sort of meant as a cynical take Okay, um, you know merit is a tough Prove yourself to this particular organization But like prove your intelligence or prove that you have a degree from the right school or prove Or you can jump through the de i hoops and do your equity statement in the right way Yeah, right, right, right. It's it's it's sort of drifted, you know drifted away from merit or from any Um ability to do something in the world that's productive other than yeah be a bureaucrat basically right right right right, um Yeah, so so like the um Um Yeah, so so you have this in and you have this situation in which whenever you basically take something that hasn't been You know power corrupts and when you take something that hasn't been Corrupted by power such as america's beautiful universities 100 years ago and you say well, why not give these smart and reasonable people power Surely they won't be corrupted by it in any way and like basically by giving Sort of all these sciences of government real power over government You've basically wound up, you know Like you needed a valve in that so that the sewage didn't flow up into the drinking water and the sewage has definitely gotten into the drinking water Yeah, um and and so like even virology it turns out can be corrupted by power Because nobody got into virology because they wanted to cause a pandemic Like, you know, this was not done by like evil scientists like, you know um Like this was done by people who were doing What cune called normal science? They were basically being like, oh, yeah And like covet has only increased the funding that's going in this direction now They're like see emerging viruses can cause huge problems We really need to make sure we catch all the pokemon and so we're going to wow and go We're going to go into the bat caves and get more bad viruses and play with them more and like It's a sort of there's a counter example to that is the tsa being erected in the wake of 9 11 Like I don't know if that's increased terrorism itself, but it it the government tapped into this way of uh, you know Just swallowed this huge Industry of checking people going through airports, right and now it's just an institution, right? It doesn't necessarily cause more terrorism, but it's now it's just a waste of time and resources Yeah, no no no and you're seeing some of that with the the covid control that will will will keep up forever basically um the Yeah, I mean that's that's like that's sort of the self-licking ice cream cone sort of in its Harmless sense where you have this thing and you know, um, take your shoes off Take your shoes off because yeah, right, right, right, right and and like the um, you know, I don't think that Taking your shoes off and dumping your water is responsible for the like the death of terrorism Or the death so far never never counted out, right? But um, no, I think that You know going going around killing people has done a lot of that. Um, but you know, so it's like you can I mean There's always a sort of defense for like you can sort of be like, yeah, let's you know Defend the theory that the u.s. Needs to be the world's policeman because otherwise, you know, somebody else would or like they're always like You know, nothing's quite black and white but the essential point that I sort of want to make is that If you're talking about a complete reset of like the meaning and purpose of government you're talking about something where like You have a lot of answers to a lot of questions that basically Date to are like really old and just happening by inertia or camera is something weird like the high school science fair or like, you know, and the need for kind of Reconsidering all of these questions in like a reasonable way is like the fundamental driving force For imagining a completely different regime. Yeah, and it's sort of hard to know There's sort of no obvious collective at all in the world that could make these kinds of Decisions or choices Collectively So I I'm bringing this up because I'm pretty sure you're gonna shoot it down But with the advent of the internet, uh, substack Let's say that the brief phenomenon of what was called the intellectual dark web just as a concept just as a concept There could be the case that the prestige makers or the king makers which Resided in the new york times and in harvard could switch online to these independent content creators that build up reputations and then bestow prestige on various different policies or various different politicians, right if we Because if you look at like the new york times of the washington post or harvard, they're spewing out all this bullshit You know all this we call it wokeness, but there's just a lot of bullshit It seems like they're they're expending their reputation. They're not making sense anymore more or less So they're their prestigious going down will not the prestige somehow democratically through the marketplace of attention Somehow replace that prestige mechanism that gives us the oligarchy that that shelves up the oligarchy It's a good question. I think the problem is that sort of power is always prestigious And the thing is you sort of you want You really want this kind of level playing field on which sense outcompetes nonsense And you basically look at this playing field and you're like, why does nonsense kind of regularly outcompete? Sense and it's because the nonsense is powerful and the sense is not And if you basically If you even just take sort of isolationism via versus internationalism Um isolation versus globalism if you want to use two pejoratives there um What you see is that There's much much more power in the active thing because the active thing basically is like We must hire a lot of people to govern the world We must think very hard about governing the world Whereas isolationism is the reverse that isolationism is like Hey, there's 50 000 of america's like smartest people in the state department. Do we need them? Why? right and And this sense of and so Is it really that big it's 50 000 people Something like that's a little smaller. I think it depends. I don't not that many fsos, but there's a lot of Yeah, it's huge, right, you know, and I mean you're governing the world man, you know, like The indirectly someone but you're governing the world so like the sense of like what it Takes to like There's sort of no situation under which the idea that Is not a source of power is going to outcompete the idea that is a source of power naturally Or it's like you're like, okay. Yeah Harvard like Like you might as an intellectual as a critic Start to develop a community of people who have a low opinion of harvard But how is that community of people going to develop the endowment the cultural capital the like regime capital? like, you know to like You're not really talking about a private institution when you you're talking about harvard and the new york times You're talking about if these things were officially parts of the government They'd be instantly recognizable as the most important and powerful parts of the government Right and and so the question is while while the governor the trust in the government and the trust in harvard the trust in The washington or the the new york times all these all these legacy institutions. They're they're spewing bullshit They're spewing the stuff that doesn't make sense. They're but the trust doesn't come from their Like ability to make sense their reputation their reputation their prestige ultimately Does not come from that reputation There's a lot of things that they have to do to maintain that prestige And there's certainly a lot of sort of prestige generating things That happen there and they certainly do select a lot of very smart people even though, you know Admissions are what they are but the like The sort of There's no way to offshore that to the internet. Yeah, there's there's no way there's no way Yeah, there's no way for sort of this like 90s dream of like people Without any status or power competing with that because basically the like The ingredient the active ingredient is basically inertial the active ingredient union is that harvard is harvard and you're not and like your ability to sort of crack into that business is like, I mean You know, it's like there's a list of um You know the top 14 law schools. I don't know why it's 14. It is 14 Why is it 500 fortune? If you go, I don't know the length of the original at least it's at least it's the round number The top 14 law schools have been the same top 14 law schools for the last 50 years they're selected by something called us news and world report which used to be a magazine of some kind and They haven't changed in the last 50 years and by the way, if you're going to law school and you're not getting a top 14 degree useless don't do it and You'll find yourself doing like discovery work or like shit work, right? You know, only the top 14 law schools are real law schools, right? So, you know, basically How do you break into that? Like It's just no way just to think of it as basically part of the government and then you're just like when you ask the question Of how does this change? Or how is this shut down? you will not expect automatic automatic market mechanisms to do that for you because actually the market loves the stenershia um You can bet on it. Yeah, it's like, you know, it's it works, right? There's nothing that makes it not work Um, even if it's creating bad laws or like, uh, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. It's like there's like a just world theory here That's basically telling you that like when harvard starts Teaching nonsense people will stop when we go to harvard and or people will stop listening to harvard or they will be like No, it doesn't really work that way. Um, it's like when harvard ends. It's because basically Somebody upstages it with another thing or it just collapses loses all this or or somebody infiltrates it or the or or the police, um, simply lock the doors and Declare that, um The campus has been seized of the trademark. It's been seized. I think it down has been seized Right, you know, and and and so and and so the the thing is that basically and that's the that's the yeah, right And and so the thing is that that when you basically You know are sort of expecting these things to happen in An automatic way and you basically are like well, this is an outrage but like God is just and god will fix it in some way and therefore I don't have to Um, or power doesn't have to know like actually only power can revise power If you look for example at like germany in 1945 Let's take germany in 1945 The occupying regime american military government, um Mg I've got the acronym has the same powers as hitler right not only can they You know, they can destroy anything that hitler created. They're not like oh, well the ss is losing its prestige He wants to join the ss and you know anymore now in 1946 like no, that's not how it worked You know when east germany was shut down it wasn't like the stasi is losing its prestige Right, it was like no actually There is a new power over this and the new power Has the power to just force this to cease to exist and it will cease to exist and So like if you look at the denazification of germany and the sort of level of There are two things that stand out about that one is The level of force required to denazify germany and the level of violence required to denazify germany the level of violence after Conquering germany, which took quite a bit of violence the level of violence needed to enforce that was almost zero There was a huge fear, you know of basically You know the occupying forces are coming into occupied germany. They're like this is the most Propagandized nationalist population in history Hitler has been filling their heads full of pure crazy for 13 years Like clearly what's going to happen is they're going to start like these like guerrilla movements They're going to go all like werewolf. There's going to be ied's like there's going to be None of that happened. Yeah, almost none of it same thing in japan Incredibly fanatical population drilled with all this propaganda You take absolute power over them and they're like quiet as lambs And their minds change, but that didn't happen in afghanistan and something about no that didn't happen in afghanistan that didn't have happened in afghanistan because basically the When you look at the way in which Like or like the specific directives like jcs 1067 is the directive for occupying germany You read this and it's basically a document of imperialism and it includes things like Americans are not allowed to fraternize with germans. They're not allowed to make friends with germans We have to understand get them to understand that this is a conquered country You know whereas in afghanistan, it's like we didn't conquer you would conquer we didn't conquer afghanistan We liberated afghanistan. We're here to advise you And so we're not in command. We're not telling you what to do So we kind of basically just pass it aggressively want you to do what we say And yeah, and we're going to give you more money if you do what we say, but we're not in command here That's imperialism. My god. We would never do that. That's bad. That would cause instant, you know revolutions Like absolutely terrible, right and the thing is so basically You know It's only that absolute is the total conquering attitude that actually affects change There's a there's a there's a an analogy that the victorians used to use which is grasping the nettle A nettle is a plant you'll find it in the pacific northwest a lot and in england with stinging hairs on it And supposedly if you touch a nettle, I have done this and it's very painful if you touch a nettle it will hurt But if you grasp it firmly it will like compress the hairs so that they don't sting And basically the lesson of grasping the nettle, which is something also very relevant in parenting you know weak parents are the ones who yell at their kids and the The the the sense you're not a parent. Are you um, you know, but I'd work with kids for A few decades now the the but I was just thinking about like the like showing up to school. This is this is why you're uh constitutionally opposed to showing up to school board meetings or making these little laws against wokeness here and there Yeah, yeah, that's just you're just touching the nettle. You're not actually you're just touching the nettle You're not actually grasping the nettle and so you'll basically see you know in any situation with kids like The nice substitute teacher is in a room that is a war zone Whereas the extremely strict teacher never raises her voice right and and the the like the the sense of that and that's just a Basic principle of like governance and management which again of power which again is completely lost here and so basically um, you know the occupiers in 45 came in with this extremely Determined attitude which actually in Germany was quite rough in japan. It was not rough But in in Germany they were quite rough But we were more lenient to japan than to germany. Yes because it was being run by macarthur specifically um And macarthur was kind of an old asia hand who kind of you know Had a sense of what to do whereas there were a lot of like ideological fanatics in the the government of the new germany You may have heard of the like morgan fowl plan or stuff like that um, but yeah, it was like it was like it was There were things like intentional starvation policies and shit, which nobody talks about. Um, yeah and um No, I could I could see like psychologically because we're closer related to germans that we would really want to kind of Beat it out of them. The ideology Of the time you can go. I always recommend this to people go on the internet. There's a little movie from 1945 This is the seuss one The yeah, the seuss one hitler lives hitler lives. It's absolutely worth seeing and um And and just don't like worry about the fact that you're typing the word hitler lives into a google search box It's a historical documentary. It's very anti-nazi to say the least um, and and your mind will be blown and the um But yeah, you know, so I think a better example in some ways is the deconstruction of east germany Because again, it's like when in 89 99 right, you know, because when you have a real regime change in a country Everyone's life changes Like there's no like everyone's life changes. Every institution is different Anything that remains is reconstructed. Most things do not remain and There's no like there's no sense that like the stasi was going to be turned into like a you know Something different in 1989 or the ss was going to be turned into something different in 1945 That's not the way it works. And so the thing is that if you basically Are really talking about a change of regime You're talking about basically Taking all of these powerful institutions inside or outside the government and basically Deconstructing them and your experience just across the board by fiat across the board by fiat and you know The experience of being because you're basically saying you're declaring that these were unofficial parts of the government And then you're reorganizing that part of the government. Yeah, and and you know the experience of being In one of these institutions or part of this sort of ruling class like that should not Be a like Painful experience. It is a little painful when basically, you know, you're a major in the stasi You put your whole career into this like whatever you've served faithfully serve the german democratic republic And like one day you're like, I know there were problems It wasn't perfect like but you know like what what are you going to do? And then one day one day one day It's all over right, you know And the your ideology the day before it's all over is just like We are the guardians of the revolution You know if like western imperialists subjugate our country. We are Professional revolutionaries. We will conspire in the cafes. We will plant our bombs. We will be just like linen and Stalin And then you realize you're not like linen and Stalin the day after you're like, oh, I was just a bureaucrat Guess what happens to you as a bureaucrat? You get a pension Okay, you're retired, you know, there's Are you saying that we have to pay off all the gender studies? Professors all of them all the critical theorists. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely because the thing is that basically that is absolutely because that Is the only way to respect what they were actually doing what they were actually doing Was not wrong because they were faithfully serving the old regime They were okay. Maybe if they did something especially evil like that could be looked at but it's like the principle that this is why like Germany today still pays pensions I believe not only to stasi officers even to some vermarked officers Right because basically what you're saying is that If you say to these people You're an alien force. You're not part of society Like you're saying We don't really own you we don't really care about you You're an outcast you should go and plot your next revolution because that's the only way you'll have a future Whereas if you're saying to them, yeah, you know what it's like Yeah, you were a professor of marxist linenist literature at the moscow university in 1987 like what is your future? I don't know was it bad Read a book read a novel like was it bad to study marxist linenist literature like yeah, okay? You know you read literature. It's fine. You're smart. You can teach school, you know, like, you know the there's like the sense of sort of responsible Leadership is very much the sense of like If you have never dehumanize Never be human if you have a regime that feels that it represents Only a part of the country That's like very bad and so the sense of basically any kind of monarchy any kind of new regime of any form in This country like one of the things that is going to be kind of its best biggest selling point Is that it's ending the kind of cold civil war? And so the sense of basically You know, what are you if you were like a critical theorist english professor like Okay, you were someone who's Entire world basically just a preacher With yeah, if you're someone whose entire world was consumed by the ideology of the old regime um The old regime has turned to dust and fallen away And like you can't go on doing that like there's no world in which people are going to pay you to do that but That doesn't make you a bad person That doesn't make it just means that you had a bullshit job under the old regime. Guess what? A lot of people had bullshit jobs under the old regime Right because like a lot of bullshit was done, right? And so the sense of basically It's over and like everyone should be fine with that It's over and that's fine rather than it's over and like Now begins the vengeance, right? You know, it's just like So why why do you think that when biden first came in he's like i'm the we're the party of unity We're going to unify the country and at this point in time He's now more or less actively like saying ultramaga. He's like doing this weird kind of rhetoric It seems kind of impotent, but it's still kind of dangerous where he's other half of the country Why would he do that? Like if that's not to support because he's you know, leaning on The half that supports him and he is like, um So he's caught in the trap of his unity. His unity is fundamentally hegemonic in in form and it can't basically This sense of like I own my base, but I own your base too Is the kind of unity that's like You know, that's a dominant like and of course dominating basically the flyover people and basically sort of, um You know Yeah, keeping them keeping this outcast or deplorables or keeping basically Like them in this sort of frame of mind where they're like you should be good enough to vote for me, you know, um In in sort of this like keeping the kind of structure between the aristocracy sort of blue state aristocracy and the red state bourgeoisie is is like, you know, you should aspire to be one of us and if you don't maybe your children will and It's not like that does not represent like there's sort of no actually like Oh, I care about red state people and I want them to be able to live their lives in like a red state way No, do you think that there's something in the system that's causing him to not be able to do that? Like if you wanted to be the the unifying president and at this point it's fallen apart I mean Whether regardless if it's him or not who's making these decisions and writing these talking points like if that was what they wanted to do What's keeping them from unifying? Well, you'd have to actually out trumping trump You know, you you'd because you lose your own base essentially, it's like you have to give If you're gonna like basically say I mean One of the things that you see sort of american Leftism or many leftisms do is they sort of Circulate their clients And so there's always this sort of client population, you know, where a hundred years ago. It's the working class It's the factory worker, right? And the thing is that at a certain point The factory worker is no longer an asset and what we really need is basically Instead of a class war we needed a race and culture war Or we're like our asset is like black americans. No way. We actually prefer mexicans Um, they're more of them now and so like we're gonna let the mexicans take the blacks jobs Right or whatever right, you know and and this sense of and like The working class like stuck with these people for A very long time you have the union Midwest union people right who basically Have been sort of voting democratic or we're voting democratic on autopilot for 50 or 60 years Until they realized that they were actually no longer The like mascot. They were now the goat. Um, if you look at the populations that Who voted for f dr? Well, who voted for f dr was a thin, you know cream of aristocrats like him and then The solid south Though, you know old democratic segregationist regimes who were Democrats because robert lee was a democrat and i've always voted democrat and i'm robert lee was a good man You know and then the inner city catholics Right and the inner city catholics and slavs who you're like what because they don't exist anymore They all got but what was their attraction like? um, again Traditional ethnic traditional ethnic power politics, right and so those were ethnic machines and those machines were basically had always been You know the democrats where america's sort of conservative party in a way But they were also the party of like the catholics and the inner city Like old, you know camity hall And like the old sort of these old style political machines And these old style political machines basically like You know when the solid south puts f dr into power They're setting into motion the forces that would destroy the solid south They have no idea they don't think of themselves when they vote for democrats is voting for liberals They think of themselves as voting for robert lee, right? And so they were the same thing with the union democrats Yeah, they kept on voting for robert lee up until like the 1960s when they're like wait a second Like this is no longer the party of robert lee, right? And so it's sort of easy when you have a client base That trusts you like that Those are the people that are going to get abused because when you can take someone for granted you know That's who you abuse and and so you know like the sense of You know, there's clearly in sort of voting in the new deal which would eventually bring them the civil rights movement There's a sense in which you know, the mark cistern false consciousness Is applicable to all of these segregationists who were voting for f dr They sort of knew he wasn't really a segregationist, but you know, like robert lee was a democrat, right? And so When you look at the various like sort of solid Blocks in um india to have this wonderful term which is vote bank Which is like a group of like ethnic votes that a politician can count on So, you know, when you look at basically like the like democratic vote bank or whatever um, you're basically seeing Yeah, I mean like certainly like so with biden is there's something about the uh his base his vote bank that needs that antagonism with this other Vote bank that he's locked into this party policy. Yeah, he's he's called civil war as you call it. Yes. Yes I mean blue state america is deeply locked into this cold cold civil war because there's really Not much they can say anymore To get, you know, the white working class or whatever. Yeah, right, you know, and and there's but there's still like there's a lot of Aspirational support out there. There's a lot of people who sort of look up to the upper class There's a lot of people like there's a lot of that, you know Even that like, you know, I mean this is where biden came from in the 70s He's going around Delaware, which is after all a southern state Basically telling everyone, you know, what a bad idea busing and desegregation are I mean, he's lived that long, right? You know, and so in the 90s he's talking about super predators, you know Like I mean, this is a very empty hollow man Which is just sort of the voice of the power around him. Yeah, exactly So he's a great. He's a great image of what we're actually dealing with in a while. Yeah, yeah, right, right, right? I like I mean, I let's let's elect him again in 2024 as he gets older and older Um, I think it would be beautiful and and the uh, he might actually just start drooling in front of his teleprompter the autumn of the page if he hasn't done that already, you know, and um Yeah, so so so like when you you know You sort of imagine, you know monarchy this like exotic system of government, which is, you know The system of government that like 99 of all people in history have lived under And then you're like, but it could be insane and do weird insane things and I'm like Actually, there's a lot of insanity there right now. You're just used to it Well, especially if if you I think there might be three kind of state you said there's a wartime and then the peacetime kind of uh Executive but there could be like a cleanup executive and then kind of a prosperous executive and then a stabilizing executive like there's kind of Yeah, the cleanup executive is definitely like the wartime executive essentially and just being able to explicitly call out power and and to regulate power through one explicit means rather than having going through this oligarchical Institutional process that gets all these weird ideas in it that it can't shake down if you have like one free agent that all Through which all power flows And the potential to clean up and then to also make decisions or at least to make decisions cleanly that can then be held account One way or another rather than it being lost in all these processes right is much Yeah, yeah, it's much more. It's much more. I mean, and it's just like you look at I constantly say this But like if you look at anything that gets done in the real world today, it's done by a monarchy Drive a car is made by a monarchy, you know that microphone in front of you It was made by a monarchy, which is a company in China, which is another monarchy So like the set of like if you look around you You see a world made by monarchies within monarchies and and like the If there was an effective oligarchical or republican way to run a company somebody would have that worked better than that somebody certainly would have found it and Because there's nothing stopping you from having a company that's run by a congress and a judiciary and a president and all that right? and um But but that's a way to run a railroad But in order for us to make that leap there has to be a huge change of view by the american Populus towards power and and one thing is to expose it like you're doing But it's another to like try to get people on the same page because everybody that I tell your ideas to recoils I'm living in washington and portland. So, you know, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course a washington state Yeah, right and and and and and so and and they recoil in a way They recoil for a couple of different reasons. They recoil at a sense of alieness and they also feel um subconsciously that A source of meaning in their lives would be taken away and The sense of having power For them is not about having a government that treats them. Well, it's about mattering in a sense and this idea that they would no longer matter in that way Feels emasculating it feels like basically people have a natural power drive and that sort of power drive is kind of Being exploited in them to give this them this illusion of mattering. Whereas it's actually sort of turns into support it's like basically Your desire to matter This guy, um, this great political scientist Guy Tana Mosca from over 100 years ago had this great term Which is a political formula And a political formula is whatever you believe that causes you to support the government So you might be in ancient egypt and you might believe that pharaoh should be on the throne because pharaoh is the son of You know the great grandson of god or something and yeah myth and basically if pharaoh is not on the throne Then the sun will not come up in the morning, right? And that's a political formula And you know 20th century political formulas tend to resolve around I feel powerful because I support the government Or you think or are you right or you know all of these Yeah, all of these things giving you a sense of meaning and importance And the thing is you're sort of trading what you don't realize is that you're trading That in order for this basically pornographic feeling of meaning and importance which is pornographic because it's not real You're not actually in the decision loop when you look at Ukraine You're not actually like moving ukraine and you know armies around on the battlefield like a chess board You're just having this kind of pornographic feeling of feeling like you are defending ukraine Just like when you view pornography, you're like i'm i'm doing it with this girl, but you're not you know and and so what that basically That sort of change of That myth That change yeah that myth that formula and what rejecting that formula sort of allows you to do is basically to change exchange this To set aside this delusional sense of power and importance And replace it with something that actually matters You can become if you basically can conquer your emotional desire for importance Then she called it like political nofap at some point. Yeah. Yeah. It's like political nofap or it's like, you know The thing that I always uh, you know the example that I always use I don't think this actually works in real life But um, there's this um legendary monkey banana trap where you basically Have a banana and you and it's inside a little enclosure and the monkey puts its hand in the box And then cannot get its hand out of the box without letting go with a banana And so and then the hunter comes along and cracks it on the head and eats fried monkey for dinner, right? and and like And you're like there are a lot of bananas outside the box, but you have to be able to let go of the banana And the sort of the problem of letting go of the banana if you look at The capacity here is why I'm optimistic about the ability For people to solve this problem Which they clearly haven't been able to do in the past. I'm optimistic about it because first of all when you compare Americans today and the way they interact with politics To the way they interacted a hundred years ago. They're much more apathetic They're sort of much less like they're much less ready ready. For example to engage in political violence Um, they're much to show up to seven hour zoom meetings Seven hour, you know, or seven hour like riots, right? You know, like you can't you know like like the um, but the race riots in 2020 Yeah, but the thing is the last time you see like white people rioting is like the 40s for example um, or you know, even like january 6 is like this incredibly pathetic thing like it's not It's pretty well, I don't know according to the democrats like it's a national holiday now They have the ceremonies and stuff about it. It's pretty powerful. It's pretty it's pretty limp, uh, you know and and like Yeah, I'll show you right, you know You want to see you want you want to see a riot, you know, um the um, um It's it's it's pretty limp and but but but we're we're expending that in a pornographic way on twitter by Doing all this culture. We're you're saying is this culture where stuff is just pornographic It's a pornographic experience release and you know the thing that can compete with pornography is sex It's like basically Whenever you sort of show people how to have actual sex um, you know That is the one way to pull them away from their porn and so The thing is I'm like no What you're doing cannot result in any real political change, but actually Real things can happen and here's how and that's sort of exciting even If it doesn't have That's exciting at a different level and in a different sense because you're like, okay They're not close to happening. It's not about to happen And what all this sort of pornographic politics is offering me is the sense that like this is about to happen Well, like elect trump and like amazing things will happen and you know, or like we'll let you know And and I'm like no none of this nothing will happen as a result of these elections But the thing is if you want to think in a way that would Lead if you can get other people to think in this way Real things to happen There's something actually more exciting about that And it's exciting in a like subtle and ironic way The idea that the way to have real power is like give up your power Has this ironic quality to it And the thing is that we are living We have the most ironic population history There's never been any period in history when like irony was his mass market The memes are a flowing my friend never anywhere close and so basically How is irony a political force like I've heard you bring this up, but what is it about it? It's a political force because it basically allows you to like say like Fuck it in a really interesting way. There's the none of the apocetic like you know that no Not in did you know the british show black mirror? Oh, yeah, yeah, if there's a there's a black mirror episode I always point people to where The population elects a cartoon character As a joke or is it like comment or is this something right? Yeah, you know and it's like or if you look at something like sort of storm area 51 That didn't come off area 51 wasn't stormed. Oh, yeah, but it kind of gives you a sense of like that The sense of Like there will be whenever this thing comes crashing down There will be like a ludic a playful sense to it Much as there was like especially like shekels of akia In 89 with like the the velvet revolution You know, um, you had this real sense of playfulness to it like an important aspect the venture of the velvet revolution was this like Sort of a banned plastic people of the universe. It was kind of velvet underground influence Like, you know, and so you had a revostov hovel who's just like ironic playwright becomes the you know It was from being a dissident to the president in Czechoslovakia Um We saw the little bit of that in the trucker uh convoy in canada. There was a communal thing But the weird thing about that was that that's where truto like showed the power of the state to people of their finances Which is really scary and people took it like Yeah, and people took it like way too Like seriously in a way And his his his move to no the banks. No the truckers the truckers took themselves way too seriously I'm sort of not seriously enough like they didn't like like like there was yeah I mean, they were they were kind of larping in the end. They weren't like it wasn't it sounds like you're you're advocating for larping But there's like some sort of truth sincerity this room. Yeah, there's there's like there's like You sort of do it as a lark, but it becomes real. It's like a basically The sense of being a sort of a joke that makes itself real I think will be kind of part Of this thing. That sounds kind of like apocalyptic or revelatory. Well, it's in a way. I mean, I mean We talked about Ukraine Ukraine elected a comedian as president, right? You know and so there's this sense of like It will feel sort of almost accidental. It won't have this sort of like Patriots rise up to like, you know feeling it won't it will be like We can't take this seriously like a carnival, right? Yeah, it will have it. It will have a very joyous Feel and not a very like a carnival. It will feel very joyous and it will not feel like And it will feel sort of that image irreversible coupled with the outcome of like somebody with absolute power completely just Liquidating all the institutions and rebooting them, which is like the most serious thing I mean, it's comedic like like I read I've been reading your sub-stack We get to the part like well, how are we going to change things and it's so out It's just so absurd. It's like we're just going to tear everything apart. We're going to take complete authority It's like what he can't do that. Yeah, and it breaks my brain every time I right and and and and that the sense of basically like Voting for that or voting to be like, you know, it's like, you know, one of the ways I sort of picture it is as I'm like imagine you're in Like the little room with the astronaut at like the end of 2001, right? And you're just in this like weird space and like there's like playing food all right Dave, right? You know, I'm sorry Dave. I can't do that, you know and and like but there's one difference There's a red button on the wall and under the red button. It says if you press this button everything will change well serious sober like a hard-working respectable people Are not going to grown-ups are not going to press that button because they're like We could just be shot into out into space. That would be a change but you know who presses the button is basically immature people childlike people like people who are have a sense of fun which is much bigger than their sense of seriousness and so, you know The people of america today are not minute men. They are not like the like paul revere is not in the building Like they do not act out of like a deep sense of Have you seen every couple months? Like there's this really stupid group of like supposed white supremacist, but it's totally an fbi sting It's like there's just footage of them. Do you know what i'm talking about? Like they're the people's army or something Yeah, and everybody's laughing at them. Nobody believes that that actually is serious right and and and and so the sense of like you know that sense of Like really Deep comedy and irony like that's so ironic that it's real Is like really crucial to that sort of spirit So how did you get this idea of any possible regime change? How did you come to this? conception um I think that it's sort of part of Kind of being brought up in the american upper class and kind of understanding it's like spirit in a way and it's like when you A good way to sort of track the spirit is in popular entertainment It's like imagine if you took a film like inception and you put it in movie theater in 1962 Like people would be like coming out of their theater just like grabbing their heads like stunned monkeys, right? You know even in like 1992 that would be like a cult film But like 20 years after that it's like a blockbuster and people are like Oh, yeah, there's three levels reality and I fall back into the bathtub every the next month, right? You know and it's like their ability to sort of switch frames Yeah Is like really really great and it's sort of much easier to just like They're sort of their attachment when you're in this sort of ironic Sophisticated state of mind. You're like attachment to the prison frame Is just not that great and so To like move you sort of along the ground is still like hard. It's hard to reason people into something but like when you're just like no Throw away everything about the way you see the world and like change to see it in this other way There's a lot of people who are just like, okay Sure, right and and that comes out of a kind of frivolousness That comes out of a like lack of virtue in a sense But like politics is the art of the possible and the thing is if you're looking for basically a politics of virtue to like unite a fundamentally Unsterious and unvirtuous population But there's still perfor larping like this bloodbath this civil war on twitter, right? Yeah, right, right and and it's just like and it's just like you can do like And you know the feeling of sort of popping people out of that is very refreshing and like the whole sort of framework of the debate the cold civil war the like issues or whatever Very tiresome very uninteresting very unchewy Your ability to get ahead left-wing politics was sort of designed to get people ahead Or it's like works sort of like like up up the classes. Is that we mean like yeah or up You know up the like rise and like have a career and a profession You know, it's like one of the ways that I described like the early new deal Is that it really was like a start-up Washington in a lot of ways And like you're like life cycle of being in the new deal had this like start-up quality Like you would graduate from say Harvard with a degree in this new science of economics in like 1935 And you know somebody who knows somebody who knows like Felix Frankfurter or Tommy Corcoran or something And so you're like make some inquiries and one day you get a call and the voice on the telephone it's like would you like to come to Washington and You know work for us and you're like what what would I be doing and the voice will be like we'll figure it out You know and you get there and you get in an office and your boss is like here's three million dollars go electrify arkansas Right, you know and that same person like 80 years later like their existence is They're basically a tracy flick, you know the the great film election um Alexander pain film from like 25 years ago or so Reese Witherspoon High school student government, right? You know, so you're like tracy flick and your goal is to get ahead in everything and be like a goody-goody And you're on the high school newspaper and you go to Harvard and you know study political science And then you're like I want to go to Washington. Okay. I'm gonna like intern for like A house member doing like a constituent service and like, you know after a while They might let me talk to the lobbyists who writes the legislation and you'd be like see here's a line of legislation I took care of for that. It wouldn't say that if I hadn't been there You didn't write it you got it from the right lobbyist or activist or whatever, right, you know, and so basically This is a very saturated system In terms of its ability to offer the things to ambitious people that ambitious people They need a similar simulacra of power, but you don't actually do anything you don't get three million dollars to electrify Yeah, and if you actually do something it's because you work really hard to get a bunch of status And then after you got that status you've got some real actual power and You know, yeah, it's like a really um It's like it's really grueling and it rewards like people who are not As imaginative and talented like people who are really imaginative talented want to it, right? And because it fucking sucks, you know, and and so you have like sort of all of these things are kind of ripe for something different in a way and like one way to think about Sort of the way that something different exists is to think about Or to sort of Define the different thing that you want to exist is to think about sort of how it should think about what we have at present How does the new regime think about the old regime? What does basically the soviet union in 1987 look like from the perspective of russia in 1997? How you look back on the old regime and it shouldn't be like oh man, I miss the old regime Wow, they could really get that shit done now our garbage doesn't get picked up. It should not be like that It should be the opposite of that, right? And so, you know if you're looking at like I mean sort of the old america from the perspective of an america where Even just basic things like you can walk safely anywhere any time of day or night, right? You know, think about how impossible it is would be to get that Basic simple feature of like the government monopoly on violence back, right? You know and and like speaking from the west coast I mean, we're kind of like Yeah, yeah experiencing class here. Portland. Did you say portland? Yeah, portland and seattle olympia Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Sure. Sure. I've seen it all right And you're saying you're saying to get back to my first question the opportunity or the the The this regime is is selecting for madness on a number of different levels and then also selecting for people who have Lot lack of talent or imagination because they would probably just want to be in a startup um to begin with So this new uh Era or new field will select for itself the leader that has the qualities that would maximize that Yeah, I mean, I think that really people underrate the extent to which sort of the structure determines the ideologies and the virtues and so basically any sort of monarchy at all would basically See that sort of bringing this like Sort of, you know, you know how hercules Sends the river into the audience tables, right? You know, uh, he he has You know in the myth of hercules. He has all these impossible tasks to do which he does in these impossible ways He's like i'm gonna clean out the dirtiest stables in the world. So like let's redirect river through it, right? you know and and sending like it's hard the sort of the course of like kind of healing and repair in that sense that Would be the obvious course for any monarch seems to me like If you took like j random ceo and made him king They'd probably are ceo of washington or you know Imperial president or whatever they'd probably mostly come out with the same kinds of things. I think it's definitely sort of like What is my role? My role is to sort of write the buck on how to do this, right? Which will I hope help it become more possible You courtesy arvin. That's your courtesy arvin. You know, my role is definitely not to be king of a possible pick of monarchy I'm a terrible. Sorry about that. I'm a terrible ceo. I've been a ceo. I'm awful at it. You really don't But i'm a more of a the priest type than the within the warrior type but But yeah, I mean like having that blueprint certainly helps or should help a great deal To make it possible. But yeah the political formulation the pre pre formulation Yeah, the you know the like why would you Yeah, the sort of the You have to have something both that is a plan that could be followed and a plan that people can believe in and You know and that that belief is going to strike people is extremely on but like America is the land of propagandizing on beliefs and you know, imagine, you know, sure I mean imagine how like Imagine what people would have thought of punk In 1963 and now the brits are going to get mad because they're going to say they invented punk. Yeah. Well, the americans Maybe but I imagine what the brits would have thought of punk in 1963. All right. Well, I should probably We've been a while on on the last questions and yeah, well, no I just want to plug your your uh, your Substack excellent work gray mirror with an a not an e correct gray the gray with an a american way And dot substack dot com. Impossible to find you on any social media other than I am not on social media Smart man. So yeah, thank you so much for your time. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. It's a terribly great time This is really fun. All right. All right. I will uh see you soon online All right. Yeah, take care.
