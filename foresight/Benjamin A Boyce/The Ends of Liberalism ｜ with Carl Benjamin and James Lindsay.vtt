00:00.640 --> 00:05.760
Benjamin sent me homework last night to read one of your articles and I may actually do a podcast

00:05.760 --> 00:11.440
based on the article at some point. Which one was that? Which one is it, Benjamin? It's your

00:11.440 --> 00:16.720
five flaws with liberal philosophy. Oh, the false assumptions, yeah. Yes, the five false

00:16.720 --> 00:25.520
assumptions. I think that's a very important piece, honestly. So, yeah. I'm working on a follow-up

00:25.600 --> 00:30.400
today, actually, because I've identified at least four more false assumptions in liberalism,

00:31.600 --> 00:35.840
which, unfortunately, it's one of the problems of it. It's just it's

00:36.720 --> 00:40.960
kind of irreconcilable for the philosophy and I'm not happy to say that, you know.

00:41.760 --> 00:46.320
Right. Yeah, I mean, I think about these things a lot because this was

00:47.200 --> 00:55.920
a philosophy that was hashed out over 200 years ago when, I mean, we're getting a lot of trouble

00:55.920 --> 00:59.680
for saying this because there's a lot of old wisdom and things, but frankly, people didn't

00:59.680 --> 01:08.000
know what the hell was going on. And liberalism falls out of the enlightenment and the enlightenment

01:08.000 --> 01:14.720
is this sprawling, messy kind of quest of discovery and, you know, the scientific,

01:15.440 --> 01:20.480
the dawning of the scientific revolution is kind of beginning, but science doesn't mature until the

01:20.480 --> 01:29.120
early 20th century, certainly until at least electromagnetism is tamed, which is early 20th

01:29.120 --> 01:37.200
century. Quantum mechanics throws a wrench into the whole thing later, but you have this kind of

01:37.280 --> 01:44.160
unfolding of ideas where people are making sort of stabs in the dark and there's this kind of,

01:45.600 --> 01:54.800
I don't know, almost miasma of deep philosophical thought mixed in with literal mysticism mixed

01:54.800 --> 02:02.480
in with religion and trying to cut apart from these things all at once, where people, again,

02:02.560 --> 02:07.760
I mean, like, you know, with the Five False Assumptions essay that you wrote, you talk again

02:07.760 --> 02:12.320
and again about this root of this kind of being in this image of the state of nature,

02:13.120 --> 02:21.440
which is, of course, just crap. No such thing ever existed. No such thing applies whatsoever,

02:21.440 --> 02:28.000
again. A bunch of them admit that it's probably not true as well. Right, which is even funnier.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.840
Yeah, why base anything on something you probably think is not true? Why do that?

02:33.280 --> 02:38.400
Because humans, I mean, what do you mean exactly? But yeah, it's just fantastic

02:39.360 --> 02:44.320
to look at this, because my opinion, and maybe you agree with me, and maybe you don't agree with me,

02:45.040 --> 02:52.960
and maybe you hope I'm right, is that there is, if we might lift language from Karl Marx,

02:52.960 --> 02:57.520
just for the hell of it, that there is a rational kernel in this mystical shell that can be pulled

02:57.520 --> 03:05.920
out and updated for the 21st century. I think that these assumptions poke at something true

03:05.920 --> 03:10.880
and valuable. I know that you have identified yourself, and I identify myself as classically

03:10.880 --> 03:15.840
liberal in many regards. I don't know if that still holds for you for sure, but with your

03:15.840 --> 03:22.960
your desire not for those, those things should not be the case over there. I feel like there's

03:23.280 --> 03:28.720
a post liberal at this point. It's not that I don't owe anything to the legacy of liberalism.

03:29.440 --> 03:34.960
I feel that it's time to figure out what was true and what was not, and then what to keep and what

03:34.960 --> 03:41.680
to lose. So in that sense, I don't know that our project is wholly different, except that what I

03:41.680 --> 03:51.680
would rather do is put the truth of those insights that are based on incorrect assumptions on

03:51.680 --> 03:57.120
firmer ground and update them for the 21st century and the circumstances we find ourselves in.

03:58.240 --> 04:02.640
That's something we can definitely discuss. Definitely something we can discuss.

04:02.640 --> 04:08.000
Where would one begin? Because both of you guys have attacked very thoroughly in your own ways,

04:08.000 --> 04:16.320
progressivism, and then moving on to, as both of you, I've watched you guys develop your critiques.

04:16.400 --> 04:21.840
You go deeper and deeper and deeper. And so where do we start after if we just say, okay,

04:21.840 --> 04:28.640
we know that something's wrong. Society is fragmenting at the same time, power is congealing

04:28.640 --> 04:35.280
in a way that doesn't seem to be good. And we want to have some sort of philosophy or some

04:35.280 --> 04:40.720
sort of philosophical grounding from which to proceed towards organizing society.

04:40.720 --> 04:47.920
So I'm seeing the situation that we're in. And then you and I spoke about this, I think after

04:47.920 --> 04:53.680
we ended the stream last time, Benjamin, where we talked about the idea of what we're dealing with,

04:53.680 --> 04:59.040
whether we call it communism or neo-communism or Marxism or this kind of legacy of Marxism or

04:59.040 --> 05:04.240
woke or the kind of weird fascist thing that they built at the World Economic Forum in the United

05:04.240 --> 05:10.240
Nations out of all of this and are applying it to us. I called it a parasite, a liberal parasite.

05:10.240 --> 05:15.360
And I think that a lot of the post-liberal movement thinks that this is the culmination

05:16.160 --> 05:22.000
of liberalism, whereas I think it is a parasite that has taken, that has slashed onto the side

05:23.840 --> 05:29.360
of liberal philosophy and societal organization and has basically taken control of the ship.

05:29.360 --> 05:34.640
It's like that beetle that went viral the other day with the parasites. It has no body left.

05:34.640 --> 05:40.480
It's just the outer carapace of the beetle walking around literally like a janky beetle,

05:41.120 --> 05:46.000
but there's no bot. The thing's not even just dead. It doesn't even have a body anymore. It's

05:46.000 --> 05:53.120
been eaten literally apart from the inside. And I feel like that we have a parasite on liberalism

05:53.120 --> 06:00.720
rather than a coming to fruit of what liberalism was always intended or likely to go to. And so

06:00.800 --> 06:04.560
when I think about that, to switch metaphors, which I know is always a dangerous thing to do,

06:05.440 --> 06:12.080
maybe more of like a garden, when does your garden get taken over by weeds? It doesn't get

06:12.080 --> 06:21.120
taken over by weeds when the plant life, for example, is healthy and well-tended. And so that's

06:21.120 --> 06:29.280
kind of, in my opinion, getting this basic philosophy right. If we want to get our basic

06:29.280 --> 06:34.800
substrate to where it excludes the possibility of the parasite being able to latch on, but the

06:34.800 --> 06:40.800
problem is the parasite's already latched on. Its fangs are deep, deep inside. It's already drained

06:40.800 --> 06:46.960
most of the blood out of society. It's drinking what it can now very quickly of what's left.

06:46.960 --> 06:50.800
And so we actually also have to kill the parasite. So what I see is we've got this

06:51.680 --> 07:01.600
weird techno transhumanist future awful thing happening, being foisted on us by the exploitation

07:01.600 --> 07:07.200
of being able to get around the kind of liberal government principles by using the corporate

07:07.200 --> 07:12.720
sector to circumvent most of the protections that are supposed to be there. So we get this kind of

07:12.720 --> 07:19.840
monstrosity. That has to be destroyed. I think that every sane person who wants freedom in the

07:19.840 --> 07:26.160
future, whether we're liberal, conservative, post-liberal, whatever has to just focus on destroying

07:26.160 --> 07:32.080
that, which includes the woke ideology. But we also have to figure out how to get this

07:32.080 --> 07:40.000
fundamental philosophical substrate right in order to make sure that we don't easily get

07:40.000 --> 07:45.360
reinfected. Or in fact, I hear a lot about creating parallel structures, parallel economy,

07:45.440 --> 07:51.280
parallel this, parallel that. I think that that's interesting and a bit

07:53.600 --> 07:59.680
ambitious and in a kind of fake way. But at the same time, how do you prevent such a thing from

07:59.680 --> 08:05.120
being immediately co-opted by the parasite? And that becomes the question. Like I'm looking at

08:05.120 --> 08:08.000
this school choice movement thing happening in the United States. And I'm just like,

08:09.040 --> 08:13.680
you guys have done literally zero of the groundwork. This whole thing is going to be a woke

08:13.760 --> 08:18.400
disaster in three years. The whole thing. Because you've done none of the groundwork to prevent

08:18.400 --> 08:22.640
your alternative structure from getting taken over from the inside. This is a mistake the

08:23.200 --> 08:27.360
reactionaries have made throughout the world. The integralist movement in South America made

08:27.360 --> 08:31.040
this. They created all these powerful structures. They got their little helicopters. They got rid

08:31.040 --> 08:35.920
of the communists. Everybody clapped and now look at South America. The whole place is going

08:35.920 --> 08:41.120
communist full blast and using the apparatuses that they created in order to oppress people.

08:41.920 --> 08:50.560
It doesn't work. It's not just making a parallel, but we have to also get the philosophy right.

08:51.120 --> 08:54.640
And it has to be the philosophy updated in terms of what we've learned. So these five

08:54.640 --> 09:00.240
false assumptions or the nine I guess now that Carl has identified of liberalism have to be

09:00.240 --> 09:05.600
addressed. Those problems have to be identified and addressed. The philosophy has to be clarified

09:05.600 --> 09:09.680
and updated. We have to figure out what liberalism actually was intending to achieve. Therefore,

09:09.760 --> 09:18.800
clear it up and then at the same time destroy this beast. I mean, I use that in the biblical sense.

09:20.320 --> 09:26.720
This beast that's consuming freedom and humanity. Not even civilization. Screwed civilization.

09:26.720 --> 09:32.640
It's consuming humanity and it has to be stopped. So these are the things that I see as our big

09:32.640 --> 09:37.680
project. But we've got to also get the philosophy right. The cultural renewal underneath the cause

09:37.680 --> 09:41.920
of whatever human liberty looks like in the 21st century has to speak into not just what

09:41.920 --> 09:46.560
we've learned that shows these nine errors, but what we also know and what we're dealing with,

09:46.560 --> 09:53.360
the tech sector. The idea of a kind of literal ethereal world that we semi-live in through the

09:53.360 --> 10:00.640
internet. Space and time are actually different. We don't need the queer theorists with their queer

10:00.640 --> 10:04.960
space and time being the only people speaking into that. Are you suggesting that we create a

10:04.960 --> 10:08.320
state of nature thought experiment for the internet? A state of virtuality?

10:08.320 --> 10:10.720
Yeah, no. Absolutely not. Absolutely not.

10:12.160 --> 10:16.560
Carl, what's your response to that? Or where would you like to focus on?

10:18.960 --> 10:25.200
I think I actually do disagree with James on this. Sorry, James. I hate to be a

10:25.200 --> 10:31.520
apologetic to disagree with me. I've got my anti-science aggression mug here for this.

10:31.600 --> 10:35.520
I'm ready. Oh, good. Yes, because I'm the leading anti-science activist.

10:38.000 --> 10:47.440
I think this probably was an inherent aspect of liberalism. It seems to be the enlightenment

10:47.440 --> 10:58.560
itself is a movement dedicated to the supremacy of reason. That seems like a rational thing to have

10:58.560 --> 11:05.360
in the 17th century when everyone is incredibly prejudiced, things are bad,

11:05.360 --> 11:10.880
people are suffering all the time, and the human condition is far worse than what we have now.

11:10.880 --> 11:14.720
But the thing is, I've come to the conclusion that ideas are a product of the time and place.

11:15.760 --> 11:21.360
They don't just exist in the ether to be accessed at any point. They are a product of the human

11:21.360 --> 11:27.840
experience, and we are living in a very different world now after 300 years of this supremacy of

11:27.840 --> 11:36.320
reason. So much good has been done that we are forgetting, we have forgotten what good can be

11:36.320 --> 11:45.520
done through ways of life that are not based on reason. In fact, much of our daily life is not

11:45.520 --> 11:51.040
really based in reason. Most of it is based in habit, in custom, in prejudice. I don't mean

11:51.040 --> 12:00.400
prejudice in the way that the left would use it to describe bigotry, but the accrued wisdom of

12:01.040 --> 12:05.760
habits is really what we mean by prejudice. We don't necessarily know. For example, I'm not

12:05.760 --> 12:12.800
vaccinated. I don't know anything about vaccines, but I thought I would just be prudent on this and

12:12.800 --> 12:18.400
not jump like everyone else. And learn, behold, I'm not worried about having a random heart attack.

12:19.360 --> 12:24.160
It wasn't because I had any special knowledge or wisdom or insight. It was because

12:25.280 --> 12:29.680
long, long experience has taught me that when everyone is moving in one direction and you're

12:29.680 --> 12:35.040
not allowed to criticize or challenge that, there's something, there's something you need to know

12:35.040 --> 12:41.120
about this. And that wasn't a product of reason. That was a product of my prejudice. And so it's

12:41.120 --> 12:44.960
not that these things aren't valuable. It's not that they don't contain knowledge and wisdom,

12:44.960 --> 12:48.960
and it's not that they aren't helpful. The problem is that prior to the enlightenment,

12:48.960 --> 12:55.440
that was the dominant paradigm. And it was oppressive. And it was maintaining social orders

12:55.440 --> 13:01.440
that people understood, rightly understood, to be intolerable and should have changed. And it's

13:01.440 --> 13:08.240
good that they did. But I think that the pendulum has swung too far now. And it's normal and natural

13:08.240 --> 13:14.480
for people who are committed to reason to stigmatize things like prejudices, things like

13:15.040 --> 13:20.240
unthinking habits, biases. It's normal for them to do that, because that's what's in the way of

13:20.240 --> 13:26.320
them achieving what they're trying to attain. But the problem, I think, that lies at the very root

13:26.320 --> 13:33.360
of the enlightenment itself is it can't really stop itself from the way it is constituted in its

13:33.360 --> 13:40.400
origins, from admitting that the ultimate goal of the enlightenment is to free the will from the

13:40.400 --> 13:47.040
body. Because ultimately, it is the physical necessity of being a human being that will forever

13:47.040 --> 13:53.200
be inhibiting what the will is. And there's a massive conversation to go into about the

13:54.400 --> 13:59.200
kind of circular nature of this as well. But I'll try and sidestep that just to save time.

14:02.080 --> 14:08.000
We see this, as James points out, very, very honestly. This was probably, I think, one of the

14:08.880 --> 14:12.160
insights, James, where I was watching one of your podcasts, and it just clicked for me,

14:12.160 --> 14:16.480
if you'd described them as a Gnostic cult, and I was, you know, that is exactly right. Because I

14:16.480 --> 14:21.360
read about Gnosticism when I was studying the Cathars. And I'd never made the connection before,

14:21.360 --> 14:25.840
and you would spot on. But that's exactly the problem, isn't it? It's the stigmatization of the

14:25.840 --> 14:30.400
material world that is the issue. And then I watched a podcast that Michael Knowles did with a

14:31.680 --> 14:37.520
science-based medical student. And he just drilled it down at the end to her saying, well,

14:38.080 --> 14:41.600
he was like, well, this is your body, then what's you? And she's like, well, it's my soul. So,

14:41.600 --> 14:47.360
oh my God, okay. So now we have arrived at the Gnostic position, where the soul proceeds the body.

14:47.360 --> 14:52.160
Now, I'm an atheist. So I don't believe that at all. I believe that the mind is a product of the

14:52.160 --> 14:56.640
body. And in fact, the mind is not separate from the body. It is a part of the body. And so,

14:57.920 --> 15:05.200
I think this is where we can properly begin to see where the Enlightenment actually has this

15:05.200 --> 15:10.480
fundamental flaw in it. And how we can begin, like I said to James just before we started,

15:10.480 --> 15:14.560
I consider myself these days sort of a post-liberal. My instincts are, of course,

15:14.560 --> 15:18.560
as they've always been, and I'm still very classically liberal in what I would choose for

15:18.560 --> 15:24.000
myself. But as I noted in those articles, there are false assumptions that liberalism is built on.

15:24.000 --> 15:31.040
And if you are forced to build an intellectual foundation that is consistent and accurate to

15:31.040 --> 15:34.400
reality, which not everyone is, I mean, you could have a mythological foundation,

15:34.400 --> 15:38.720
which lots of people do. And that's not necessarily bad either. That's another conversation.

15:39.600 --> 15:46.640
Then we have to ascertain what the real situation was, and as you pointed out, James,

15:47.200 --> 15:50.960
they were doing their best 300 years ago. But of course, there's just so much more that we know

15:50.960 --> 15:59.040
now, thanks to the use of reason. So the core thing for me is to actually stitch back together

15:59.600 --> 16:04.880
reason and our physical bodies. This is something I think actually needs to happen.

16:04.880 --> 16:05.920
In tradition too.

16:06.720 --> 16:11.440
Well, that's the point. Almost everything physical you do is kind of a tradition. It's

16:11.440 --> 16:14.880
kind of part of a tradition. You get up every morning and you get your breakfast and you

16:14.880 --> 16:18.560
don't think, well, you can have breakfast. What do I feel like? And on a Thursday,

16:18.560 --> 16:21.840
you might feel like a fry up or something. I don't know. But you make your breakfast,

16:21.840 --> 16:25.680
you don't really think about it. It's just something you do. And this is the habitual

16:25.680 --> 16:33.120
patterns of life. This is most of what we do. And it's okay that that is unreasoned. It's okay

16:33.120 --> 16:37.440
that most of our life is actually kind of impulsive, as Jonathan Heitzwerk has gone through,

16:37.440 --> 16:41.680
and we've known as far back as human. Actually, most of what we do isn't

16:41.680 --> 16:46.000
rationalized. Most of what we do is post hoc rationalization for what we've just done,

16:46.000 --> 16:52.720
because habitually, we've always done it. And so the remarriage of these things

16:52.720 --> 17:00.160
is an important thing. But what I think that does is actually to destroy the concept of ideology

17:00.160 --> 17:07.280
itself. And that's a problem for ideologists. And ideologists are mostly, as far as I can tell,

17:08.160 --> 17:12.000
a product of the Enlightenment. I think you could make an argument that Islam is a form of

17:12.000 --> 17:18.560
political ideology that came obviously long before. But what do you mean by ideology? Like a

17:18.560 --> 17:24.160
ruling co-herit? So there are lots of definitions of ideology, and no one seems to be able to nail

17:24.160 --> 17:28.880
them down. But a few that I've been working with, one of them comes from critical race theory,

17:28.880 --> 17:34.960
actually, which is a set of contested ideas. And the second one is from Oak Shots, where it's

17:36.160 --> 17:41.680
the distillation and abstraction of a political tradition that is used in order to justify the

17:41.680 --> 17:46.800
seizure of power. And actually, I think that one, combined with the other one, but that one is the

17:46.800 --> 17:54.800
most accurate because an ideology is essentially programming code for political NPCs, for midwits,

17:54.800 --> 18:01.200
to tell them, oh, no, if you do this, this, and this, you should get X or Y result. And now,

18:01.200 --> 18:05.840
I mean, we know that this just generally isn't true for most ideologies, because the world is

18:05.840 --> 18:14.560
horrifically complex. But it is the retreat out of, I should say the advance out of this

18:14.960 --> 18:21.360
scholarly place into a more real place, where we're approaching the sort of more Edmund

18:21.360 --> 18:26.400
Burkean position of, yes, I'm a wig, yes, I'm all these things. But I also think the traditions are

18:26.400 --> 18:33.600
important. To kind of marry these things back together, I think is actually the job of post-liberals,

18:34.160 --> 18:39.840
because we don't want to lose the good things that liberalism provided to us. But we also don't

18:39.840 --> 18:43.840
want those things weaponized against us. And when you're existing purely in the world of theory,

18:44.320 --> 18:49.120
actually, that's entirely possible, as James and I have both spent a lot of time explaining through

18:49.120 --> 18:56.400
critical race theory. It's actually an attack on the liberal view of civil rights that birthed

18:56.400 --> 19:02.960
critical race theory and has allowed it to prosper, because the parasite itself knows how we work.

19:02.960 --> 19:07.280
And so it can do these things. And so we want to retain the good things that we

19:08.160 --> 19:14.560
achieved without opening the door to radical extremism, like the critical race,

19:14.560 --> 19:21.760
critical race theorists. And we also want to rehabilitate the authentically human dimensions

19:21.760 --> 19:26.720
of being a human. Because one of the problems of reason is that we're looking at AI at the moment,

19:26.720 --> 19:31.120
saying, okay, well, it's only a matter of time until this is effectively human, as far as we

19:31.120 --> 19:34.960
can tell, because it's capable of reason. But I think that's the wrong way of looking at it,

19:34.960 --> 19:39.680
because the constituency then, if it's a rational being, well, a lot of things could end up being

19:39.680 --> 19:45.120
rational, but only one type of thing is a human. And that's the thing I think we need to be concerned

19:45.120 --> 19:50.880
about, because we are all humans. And the human experience is very rich and very complicated.

19:50.880 --> 19:58.480
And I think that we need to bring these things back together. And that means we need to, I think,

19:58.480 --> 20:05.840
have a more sentimental view of ourselves, each other, and the sort of connective tissue between

20:05.840 --> 20:10.720
each people, each person, that is the relationship that they have with one another, with the place

20:10.720 --> 20:15.680
around them, with their own civilization, with their country, that any metaphysics that they

20:15.680 --> 20:23.920
happen to hold. That I think is what needs to really be thought about, rather than trying to

20:23.920 --> 20:29.200
continue on the path of ideology in order to try and defeat the woke virus. I mean,

20:29.200 --> 20:33.840
I agree it needs to be defeated. But I think, actually, it's kind of a more advanced technology

20:33.840 --> 20:38.640
in that regard. And so it'd be like trying to win the American Civil War with bows and arrows,

20:38.640 --> 20:44.400
rather than rifles. I don't think you can do it. So I'll leave that there.

20:44.400 --> 20:53.120
But a sentimental connection to each other can just as easily slip into a ideology or a formula

20:53.120 --> 20:58.480
for acquiring political will, which is not necessarily bad, because we need to have some

20:58.480 --> 21:03.120
sort of political will to protect society and some sort of unification within that.

21:03.120 --> 21:10.880
But you see from the left, or at least from the elite, that any sort of disturbance of

21:10.880 --> 21:17.360
a American nationalism freaks them out, or they continually prop it up as controlled opposition.

21:18.320 --> 21:26.160
So just to make a point there, the problem with an ideology is defined a priori

21:27.360 --> 21:35.680
from a position that is not interested in what the world is like. And so it describes what it

21:35.680 --> 21:42.240
wants in an idealistic way, and then tries to format the world to fit that. The difference

21:42.320 --> 21:49.440
between that and this sentimental view of politics would be to take things as they are

21:49.440 --> 21:55.200
and try and imagine a slightly better future, rather than reformat the entire world. So you

21:55.200 --> 22:01.200
are localizing the issue that you're trying to change, rather than universalizing it, which is,

22:01.200 --> 22:04.960
I think, the inherent problem with ideologies. Because you're starting in the realm of the

22:04.960 --> 22:09.200
abstract and then coming into the real, rather than coming into the real, and then trying to

22:09.200 --> 22:13.040
look slightly ahead. It works in different directions.

22:14.560 --> 22:19.600
So on the topic of ideology, just to kind of put it out there, and maybe this will help you

22:19.600 --> 22:23.120
since you're working on a project with it, Carl. I don't know if you've ever read,

22:23.120 --> 22:26.960
you mentioned critical race theory. I don't know if you've ever read this book called,

22:28.080 --> 22:34.160
what's it called, From Class to Race by Charles Mills.

22:34.400 --> 22:40.880
And so the first chapter, I hesitated to read this thing forever, and I finally sucked it up

22:40.880 --> 22:47.120
and read it. And the first chapter actually is Charles Mills, who's a very, he recently died,

22:47.120 --> 22:53.120
like last year or something, or the year before. He's a very famous, I've been told I'm not

22:53.120 --> 22:56.640
allowed to call him a critical race theorist, because he's a critical philosopher of race,

22:56.640 --> 23:00.240
and we can all go off in our leftist circles and jerk around or whatever we do in them.

23:00.400 --> 23:09.360
But anyway, the first chapter, he basically lays out literally a claim that everybody who's

23:09.360 --> 23:15.680
a Marxist ever misunderstood Marx about ideology. And he gives the most cogent explanation of what

23:15.680 --> 23:20.560
it is that I think I've ever read. It's one of the most valuable chapters I've ever read in my life,

23:20.560 --> 23:26.160
I think. And what he mostly is doing is taking apart other Marxists and saying how inadequate

23:26.160 --> 23:35.120
they are, which is, for me, just great. But the definition kind of boils down to that it is the

23:35.120 --> 23:43.280
mythology, that the ruling class kind of semi organically, but sometimes deliberately weaves

23:43.280 --> 23:52.640
in order to justify, maintain, and entrench its own power. And so it is a political mythology.

23:52.640 --> 23:57.360
And the reason I think that we see this rising within the Enlightenment is not specifically

23:57.360 --> 24:02.800
because of something to do with the Enlightenment, although perhaps I'm open to the contention,

24:03.680 --> 24:10.960
to the hypothesis. What I see happening in this regard is that the, when you said that it clicked

24:10.960 --> 24:15.440
with you with the Gnosticism, I think that what we saw is that the kind of Gnostic architects

24:16.640 --> 24:21.200
that were kind of operating in parallel, and not even in parallel, literally mixed in,

24:21.200 --> 24:26.400
I said miasma earlier, and I really mean it. There was no real distinction between mystics and

24:26.400 --> 24:31.680
scientists and philosophers, and even theologians sort of throughout Europe in the late Middle

24:31.680 --> 24:36.240
Ages, early modern period. There just wasn't Francis Bacon, which one was he, all of them.

24:36.240 --> 24:43.600
So what are you going to do? Newton, several of them at once, you go to the Swabian pietist the

24:43.600 --> 24:49.520
theologians from which Hegel and Marx derive several at once. What do you, I mean, it's just

24:49.520 --> 24:54.000
mixed together. This is the problem with thinking from three, four hundred years ago,

24:54.000 --> 25:01.600
is we hadn't clarified some of these things. And so what I see there is that the Gnostic

25:01.600 --> 25:09.600
project got moved into politics, sociology and economics very deliberately. And the reason

25:09.600 --> 25:14.800
I actually say that Hegel is the one who codified this, I don't think it's his doing.

25:14.800 --> 25:20.880
We might blame Kant. We could definitely blame Rousseau, who I fear you sound a little bit like

25:22.080 --> 25:27.360
at this point. I'm very, very familiar with Rousseau. And so I can explain why I'm not.

25:28.320 --> 25:32.320
I'm nervous that the project you've outlined attends in the Rousseauian direction,

25:33.520 --> 25:39.680
without some guardrails at least, the sentimentality, the, you know, attempt to get back to sensuousness

25:40.480 --> 25:46.480
as a meaning, as a basis for understanding reality. But I don't disagree with you about

25:46.480 --> 25:50.880
the body being the center of our experience and the mind. I'm all, you know, I'm also famously

25:50.880 --> 25:56.800
an atheist, aka America's top Christian nationalist, but that's my other Christian nationalist.

25:56.800 --> 26:02.400
Oh, really? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Well, we're at the forefront of this movement that's definitely

26:02.400 --> 26:06.960
not a Fed operation in the United States at all, like the most obvious one that's ever been created,

26:07.520 --> 26:12.400
like watching them just jump into it. But no, what I see though, is that I see that the mysticism

26:12.400 --> 26:16.880
got moved into politics, into the Rumble politics. And I think Hegel codified this with the phenomenology

26:16.880 --> 26:22.480
of spirit. In fact, this is sort of the other day, believe it or not, I tweeted, I just spent half

26:22.480 --> 26:27.200
my day reading Judith Butler, and it was surprisingly clarifying. First of all, I shocked

26:27.200 --> 26:32.720
myself. I don't know if you've had the pleasure. I've read Jen to trouble. Yeah. Well, as you know,

26:32.720 --> 26:39.600
it's a slightly painful book to read. Didn't she win like first place or second place in like worst

26:39.600 --> 26:44.160
sentence ever contest or the worst writing ever or something? I don't know. I wouldn't be surprised

26:44.160 --> 26:48.800
if she did. I can sit down and read Judith Butler straight through like it's not that hard now.

26:48.800 --> 26:54.640
Are you found out the Judith code? Well, I just know what the words mean and how they construct

26:54.640 --> 26:58.960
sentences. So it's really not that complicated. I read I had the same thing with that was

26:59.920 --> 27:07.200
the dialectic of sex. I can't remember. Oh, yeah, that one. Yeah. That was the first

27:07.200 --> 27:11.920
principle theory books I was going to I tried to read. Total gibberish after about four years of

27:11.920 --> 27:16.880
studying, I went back and reread it. I was like, I get this. Yeah, it took a long time. And Falstow

27:16.880 --> 27:22.400
Sterling, that's who we're looking for on that one, I think. So anyway, I'm reading Judith

27:22.400 --> 27:25.920
Butler and it finally clicks with me because she's got this whole thing. I'm kind of like

27:26.880 --> 27:30.400
blowing my load too early here talking about this because I want to talk I want to do my own

27:30.400 --> 27:37.760
podcast about this issue. But she's deriving this quote from Foucault, where Foucault, of course,

27:37.760 --> 27:41.760
you know, these fucking French guys. So what are these post monitors? What does he do? Well,

27:41.760 --> 27:45.920
it's not that the some very with the Gnostic concept, right? It's not that the body is the

27:45.920 --> 27:50.560
prison for the soul. It's the soul is the prison for the body. That's Foucault. That's a literal

27:50.560 --> 27:55.440
statement from Foucault. Judith Butler brings it up repeatedly throughout her writing. It's

27:55.440 --> 28:00.240
mentioned in some other kind of foundational queer texts. So this is an important concept. And of

28:00.240 --> 28:04.080
course, you read it and you're like, that makes zero sense whatsoever. How is the soul the prison

28:04.080 --> 28:09.280
for the body? And what you realize is that what I'm saying when Hegel codified, what I'm seeing in

28:09.280 --> 28:15.040
this transition to modern mysticism or modern Gnosticism, modern era Gnosticism is which is,

28:15.040 --> 28:21.440
by the way, what Marxism kind of distills and it makes actionable. He becomes like the grand

28:21.440 --> 28:28.000
priest of this is how you do modern Gnosticism. What Hegel codified is that the social constructions

28:28.000 --> 28:33.680
are the spirit. So the social construction of society around you, which you're trying to manipulate

28:33.680 --> 28:40.080
by either manipulating the idea or the material conditions, the the the the geist of society

28:40.720 --> 28:45.600
is the spirit. But that's that I mean, literally, that's what the word means phenomenology

28:45.600 --> 28:52.160
disguises. That's what the word means. So it's a spirit. And your soul is as a person, just part

28:52.160 --> 28:57.680
of that spirit, which is on the trajectory of transformation of of history. And so you are

28:57.680 --> 29:03.120
a part of that greater spiritual whole, your soul, whatever that represents is therefore your

29:03.120 --> 29:07.280
understanding of yourself through the social constructions of reality. And thus the soul,

29:07.920 --> 29:12.400
which is the social constructions of reality applied to you becomes the prison for your body.

29:12.400 --> 29:16.000
So you're born with a weenie and the social constructions of what it means to be a man

29:16.000 --> 29:20.880
imprison you because of your body. So your body is imprisoned because I'm like, oh,

29:20.880 --> 29:25.920
shit, that's what she means. That's what Foucault means. The social constructions become the

29:25.920 --> 29:32.240
artifice of the prison of the Gnostic line of thought in the modern going into postmodern

29:32.240 --> 29:40.560
era. I do like this idea of it being a superior technology to have exploited this phenomenon.

29:40.560 --> 29:44.800
But what you're seeing is simultaneously, we always talk about like the enlightenment,

29:44.800 --> 29:48.160
and then there's a counter enlightenment, right? And of course, we got Stephen Hicks,

29:48.160 --> 29:51.840
brilliant guy. I don't know if you've ever met him. He's fun to be around, actually.

29:51.840 --> 29:55.760
Spoken to many times. Yeah, I like Stephen quite a lot. And Stephen's got his wonderful book,

29:55.760 --> 30:00.240
what, back from 2005. So we're talking a while ago explaining postmodernism,

30:00.240 --> 30:06.240
and he's talking about the counter enlightenment. And he's approvingly interacted with stuff I've

30:06.240 --> 30:09.760
said to this, but I haven't spoken with him about it yet. I actually should call him and

30:09.760 --> 30:14.640
talk to him. You definitely should. I mean, we've talked many times. We actually went to

30:14.640 --> 30:20.320
the beach together for like a week. It was kind of fun. But I don't think there was a

30:20.320 --> 30:25.840
counter enlightenment. I think there were two. I think there was the religious reaction to the

30:25.840 --> 30:30.400
enlightenment. And then there was the romantic reaction to the enlightenment. And I don't think

30:30.400 --> 30:36.960
that these two things are perfectly separable, right? Again, that mixture of enlightenment

30:36.960 --> 30:41.200
thought, religious thought, and then mystical thought or Gnostic thought, all kind of blended

30:41.200 --> 30:46.720
together in this. There was no distillation of these kind of three alchemical ingredients.

30:46.720 --> 30:53.360
And the romantic reaction, this is where when I start hearing sentimental and during a Purse.

30:53.360 --> 30:56.800
So maybe I should have chosen my words more carefully. I'll explain in a minute.

30:56.800 --> 30:59.520
That's fine. That's fine. And I'm not putting you on the spot. I'm just no, no, no, no,

30:59.520 --> 31:03.680
I just reacting as I go. But the romantic reaction is,

31:04.000 --> 31:09.680
is so if we think of the religious reaction to the enlightenment as the ability to carve out

31:09.680 --> 31:15.040
space for faith against reason, and there's a huge interesting discussion, I'm about to have a talk

31:15.040 --> 31:20.960
I did in December come out today or tomorrow actually on this specific thing that I think

31:20.960 --> 31:25.680
actually paints a way forward that might tap into something you really like. If we think of the

31:25.680 --> 31:31.200
religious reaction as carving out against reason space for faith, I think of the romantic reaction

31:31.200 --> 31:39.680
as carving out against reason space for mysticism and mythopoiesis. And I think that's poison,

31:39.680 --> 31:45.280
and that's where the parasite lives. And so the space forward for me looks like, how do we get

31:45.280 --> 31:50.640
faith and reason? For me, the magic sauce of the West, Ben Shapiro touches it in his, I forget

31:50.640 --> 31:55.760
which book it is, he writes a book like every 15 minutes. You know, he writes at the same speed,

31:55.760 --> 32:03.920
he talks. And so very far behind him. I'm trying to catch up. I'm training. I'm training. I got

32:03.920 --> 32:09.920
an energy drink in my Hotez mad cup over here. I don't have coffee or tea in it. But no, what he

32:09.920 --> 32:16.720
says is that it's somehow Athens plus Jerusalem, right? And so what is that emblematically, that's

32:16.720 --> 32:22.080
kind of an archetype of reason that's Athens and an archetype of faith that's Jerusalem,

32:22.080 --> 32:29.440
and also tradition, the Jewish tradition. I mean, Hanukkah, you eat fried food because 5,000 years

32:29.440 --> 32:34.400
ago, they didn't run out of oil one day. Like, that's tradition. Like, you can't beat tradition to

32:34.400 --> 32:40.000
that level, right? And so the idea of those things coming together to box out mysticism

32:40.000 --> 32:44.880
is I think what's made the West so successful. But we've had this weird undercurrent of mysticism,

32:44.880 --> 32:50.080
and sometimes just main current, we can't deny that there were masons involved in the founding

32:50.080 --> 32:54.080
of the United States and in the direction of its creation. What do you mean by mysticism?

32:55.040 --> 33:00.960
I mean, these kind of Gnostic, esoteric and hermetic approaches to transforming reality.

33:01.680 --> 33:08.480
But it's similar to affecting your will upon reality, or some sort of process.

33:08.480 --> 33:13.440
It's the ability to believe that you can project your will forward into reality and make your will

33:13.440 --> 33:18.480
come to be in reality, which is the realm where ideology lives. In fact, it's in a sense what

33:18.480 --> 33:24.960
ideology as Carl was describing it. It's what it exists to do, that you put your idea out first.

33:25.680 --> 33:30.800
And then what you do, ironically, almost is you pretend that science, you pretend that you've

33:30.800 --> 33:36.560
put out the hypothesis, and then you check against reality to tweak your hypothesis to keep going

33:36.560 --> 33:40.480
forward. But in fact, really, what you're doing is you're bending circumstances to make your

33:40.480 --> 33:44.880
hypothesis come true, and you never allowed to be falsified. And that's the problem. And I say,

33:44.880 --> 33:48.640
it's, and I'll let Carl talk and let you guys talk in a second, but just to bring it up,

33:48.640 --> 33:52.480
we do have to go back when we start excavating the roots of this, and I brought up Athens,

33:52.480 --> 33:59.440
we have to excavate deep, because when Plato names Sientia, that's what he's actually talking about

33:59.440 --> 34:05.120
anyway. These guys, Sientia is broken down into two components. If you go read how he

34:05.120 --> 34:10.480
organized it, you've got a piece to May, which is the higher level reason thinking,

34:10.480 --> 34:14.880
and then you have the lower level of, you know, knowing stuff, understanding how the world works,

34:14.880 --> 34:20.080
called Dianoya, that applies to Techne, which is Techne is the idea of gaining technical

34:20.080 --> 34:24.720
knowledge to be able to do things in the world. So why is that relevant? Because how did it get

34:24.720 --> 34:29.760
into this story that I'm telling? Well, it's not even that mysterious, there's pretty good

34:29.760 --> 34:36.240
evidence out there that Hegel just imported that architecture from Plato, which is to build a

34:36.240 --> 34:40.400
technocracy. That's what, if you read Republic, that's what he's describing, is a technocracy.

34:41.360 --> 34:48.240
That's the technology to build a technocracy on. The episteme is the higher level reason of the

34:48.240 --> 34:53.280
philosopher kings who are going to guide the knowledge to the point of, wherever the ideology

34:53.280 --> 34:57.680
points that they've thought up, their philosophy that they thought up a priori from the realm of

34:57.680 --> 35:02.480
reason and the forms of how the world should be. And then Hegel just imports a shit and puts it

35:02.480 --> 35:08.720
in German, calls them for numftim, for stand. And all of a sudden, he has this exact same program.

35:08.720 --> 35:16.640
He updates it to early modern thinking or kind of late period. It's like the late end of early

35:16.640 --> 35:21.040
modern, I don't know what they call that late early modern, because he's talking about, if you

35:21.040 --> 35:24.880
read philosophy of right, he's talking about organizing a constitutional monarchy. If you

35:24.880 --> 35:31.600
actually read it, you're like, wow, that looks like America with a king. And like, it's a lot of

35:31.600 --> 35:37.200
the same stuff. Of course, America preceded Hegel in this, this was like 1821 or something like

35:37.200 --> 35:41.920
that. He's writing this down. And so it's like divided powers, it sounds great, but you still

35:41.920 --> 35:47.360
have this king. And this, you know, how it's in that, how's the king chosen, well, by the forces

35:47.360 --> 35:52.160
of history and the conflict of opposites. And you know, all this nonsense that they're always into,

35:52.160 --> 35:57.920
but he just imported the tech, the platonic technocracy with the concept of the platonic

35:57.920 --> 36:04.400
epistome being the pathway to understand the ideology that guides the technocracy,

36:04.400 --> 36:10.400
put it in German. And he actually becomes the guy who outlines the plan that Marx picks up and says,

36:10.960 --> 36:16.240
actually, yeah, but flip it over so that we get to be on top as the grubs that don't do anything

36:16.240 --> 36:20.880
and have an entitlement complex and hate everybody and don't take baths and stuff.

36:21.520 --> 36:25.840
Let's take the program and flip it over so we win. But other than that,

36:26.560 --> 36:31.760
yes. And the thing that's keeping this thing, this pyramid, the platonic pyramid of society upright

36:32.720 --> 36:38.400
is the mythology called ideology that's understood in terms of they're in German,

36:38.400 --> 36:45.920
they're fernund, the reason as it gets translated that guides the, the ideological program. And so

36:45.920 --> 36:51.280
what did not to again put Carl on the spot because I actually like him. But when he says, you know,

36:51.280 --> 36:54.960
this is the end of ideology, that's what Marx said he was building was the end of ideology.

36:55.600 --> 36:59.680
But really what it was, of course, doing was he was forwarding his own ideology. So I'm not

36:59.680 --> 37:04.160
saying this is what Carl's doing. Just everybody's clear. I'm saying that becomes a pitfall

37:04.960 --> 37:10.880
of programs going forward that we must be very cautious about. And so for me,

37:10.880 --> 37:14.960
I define liberalism and the Enlightenment very differently. I don't actually,

37:15.600 --> 37:18.720
like I look back at these philosophers, these false assumptions, and I think,

37:19.520 --> 37:24.560
aren't they adorable? That's great. But what I'm trying to find the essence under it.

37:24.560 --> 37:30.160
And I think the essence under the liberal project is that none of us is God. That's it.

37:30.160 --> 37:34.320
That's none of us has the power. None of us can become God. And that's retaining that human

37:34.320 --> 37:39.600
thing you were speaking of. It also refutes the world economic form. Literally explicitly,

37:39.600 --> 37:45.840
a homo deus coming from God, man coming from a Harari, him openly saying,

37:45.840 --> 37:50.480
they are going to become gods and little see the arrogance of these people.

37:50.480 --> 37:55.360
Look at him. He's gollum. He just hasn't turned ugly yet. Like he literally gollum.

37:55.360 --> 38:01.760
And so he's got the ring. He's my precious. And humans are hackable animals, these people.

38:01.760 --> 38:05.760
But it's that we're not God. And so how do we determine questions of things like political

38:05.760 --> 38:10.640
authority? Who gets it? Well, the liberal answer in my opinion is, well, nobody deserves it.

38:10.640 --> 38:15.760
So now we come up with a scheme to lend it to people with the consent of the people being

38:15.760 --> 38:20.800
governed, et cetera, divided powers and all this. So I keep coming back to this and like Christians

38:20.800 --> 38:26.160
tend to get pissed at me because I'm like distilling their Christian heritage of the nation or whatever.

38:26.160 --> 38:32.000
But I actually think the fundamental assumption of this kind of broadly successful liberal project is

38:32.880 --> 38:36.720
you're not God and you don't get to be God. In fact, that's true for everybody.

38:36.720 --> 38:44.080
So you end up getting, you know, kind of a, we don't have obvious like physical equality.

38:44.080 --> 38:47.760
Like some people are better at stuff, et cetera, or some people are bigger, some people are stronger,

38:47.760 --> 38:52.800
some people are stupid, some people are whatever. We don't have that. But we, in terms of what it

38:52.800 --> 38:57.920
means to have fundamental human dignity, there's a fundamental basis of equality because only God

38:57.920 --> 39:04.000
in some sense has the authority to judge what somebody's human worth is. And since it's not,

39:04.000 --> 39:08.160
it doesn't matter if God exists or not. All you have to say is none of us is that. So who has the

39:08.160 --> 39:13.440
authority? And so what the whole liberal project does is it open for me is to open the door to

39:13.440 --> 39:20.640
start trying to figure out how do we solve actual practical political problems under the assumption

39:20.640 --> 39:24.960
that none of us gets to play God over anybody else? And it's not more complicated than that.

39:25.760 --> 39:31.520
Everything else is details that flow downstream from this. Assumptions like the blank slate and

39:31.520 --> 39:39.120
things are just frankly idiotic. Good try, John Locke, which thank you so much for your project,

39:39.120 --> 39:43.440
especially for your articulation of the necessity of life, liberty, and property as

39:43.440 --> 39:50.240
inalienable rights to secure liberty. But the blank slate, I mean, in the state of nature,

39:50.240 --> 39:54.240
like, come on, guys, you can't blame him for his time, though, you know, you can understand why

39:54.240 --> 39:59.200
you think of the state of nature thing. But yeah, he actually seems to have believed it as well.

39:59.760 --> 40:06.080
Yeah, that's, that's, that's literally silly. Yeah, it is. And there's so much in John Locke

40:06.080 --> 40:13.440
that is in one way genius and in the other way, obviously crackpot. And it does make me wonder,

40:13.440 --> 40:17.600
but how old was he when he was writing this stuff? Because we often forget that a lot of these guys

40:17.600 --> 40:22.880
were like in their 20s. Yeah, I would have to go back and check. I know he had to go into exile

40:22.880 --> 40:27.760
after writing and he had to write it anonymously. Because what he was saying, he knew was insanely

40:27.760 --> 40:33.520
radical. And this is actually one of the one of the sticks I used to beat the reactionaries now.

40:33.520 --> 40:38.640
Well, like, well, this is, this is our version. And it's like, no, you are sitting in your house

40:38.640 --> 40:42.880
that you own, and you're not worried about the state kicking down the door with you openly

40:42.880 --> 40:49.040
espousing counter radical views. And so actually, we can say that liberalism has done good things.

40:49.040 --> 40:53.440
And there are fruits of it that we'd like to harvest and keep. And so this is so many of these

40:53.440 --> 40:58.480
guys that are telling me that they're ready for the war and that they practice on call of duty.

40:58.480 --> 41:03.040
And like, they're not going to go to war, they're going to post memes to inflame it. And I'm like,

41:03.680 --> 41:10.240
bro. Yeah. I have spoken to the, I went to a conference with them last year and I'm going to

41:10.240 --> 41:16.000
get this year as well. So a lot of them are nice people, but just a bit online. And so essentially

41:16.000 --> 41:19.120
my first explanation was that we're not, we're not revolutionaries. We're not going to, we're not

41:19.120 --> 41:23.680
going to take up arms. Don't be silly. You know, none of you are. And that's fine. You don't have

41:23.680 --> 41:28.400
to be, we can win this in other ways. Because in one sense, they have something that is true,

41:28.400 --> 41:34.480
right? They have a good grasp on like the human, the genuinely sentimental, artistic human,

41:34.480 --> 41:38.080
the aesthetic side of what it means to be a human. What, what makes life worth living?

41:38.080 --> 41:43.120
Right. And that's what I think actually the enlightenment kind of doesn't have. And this

41:43.120 --> 41:48.160
is what we need to start stitching back together. Because I agree with, by the way, great. In fact,

41:48.160 --> 41:53.280
I think it's a, I think it's a feature, not a bug, but it leaves a massive hole. That's a problem.

41:53.280 --> 41:58.960
Well, I, I, I... It's not just aesthetic. It's familial. It's family.

41:58.960 --> 42:05.680
If we say aesthetic is in coming at the, having its origins in the sentiments, right? The,

42:05.680 --> 42:10.000
the, what the, what an aesthetic experience is not something that's outside the world. It's

42:10.000 --> 42:13.840
actually something that's within us. And it is playing on our sentiments, the environment plays

42:13.840 --> 42:19.520
in our sentiments in order to make us feel in a particular way and have certain kinds of experiences.

42:19.520 --> 42:25.680
And so the human experience is mostly aesthetic in that way. And so this, this is where I feel

42:25.680 --> 42:31.520
actually we can say it's kind of the fault of the enlightenment. But when I say that, I'm not

42:31.520 --> 42:37.200
saying, right, we need to jettison that because that's obviously irrational and silly because

42:37.200 --> 42:40.960
so much good stuff came out of the alignment. We don't want to jettison the good things,

42:40.960 --> 42:45.280
but we also don't want to be committed to the obvious absurdities. And James,

42:45.280 --> 42:52.960
make a good point there. The, it is important and I, I swear to God, like it makes me laugh so hard

42:52.960 --> 42:58.400
that it's too atheist saying, look, we need God. Okay. We need, we need to have that spot filled

42:58.400 --> 43:04.720
because at the moment, look at the transhuman and transgender is I am God and I will remake my body

43:04.720 --> 43:08.080
in my own image, right? It's like, no, you're not, you're, you're actually someone with a mental

43:08.080 --> 43:11.760
illness. Okay. Right. I'm not trying to... And that's literally the hermetic thing, right?

43:11.760 --> 43:15.760
Yes. It actually says at the point, you know, like the corpus hermeticum, like the poimondris

43:15.760 --> 43:20.400
says that the point is to remember that you're God and then to become God. Yeah.

43:20.400 --> 43:27.840
And exactly. And so we need to, we need to acknowledge that actually the problem with

43:27.840 --> 43:34.240
reason alone is that it thinks, of course, it processes the world in abstractions and

43:34.880 --> 43:41.280
it categorizes the world. And that's actually the opposite of, I think, how the aesthetic world

43:41.920 --> 43:46.880
exists. And so we need to find a way of reconciling these things because, so look,

43:46.880 --> 43:50.800
picking up on your point on Rousseau, I, now that after you said it, I thought, oh, how did he get

43:50.800 --> 43:55.600
to that? But I kind of see how what I said could lead you to that point. But it's actually the

43:55.600 --> 43:59.200
opposite of where I'm trying to go with this. Because so one of the, one of the good things

43:59.200 --> 44:04.160
about liberalism is its individuality. It's individualism. It is a good thing to treat

44:04.160 --> 44:11.600
a person as some, a cause in and of themselves and as something that is perfect and not a perfect,

44:11.600 --> 44:19.280
sorry, worthy and unique, right? So yeah, sacred. Yeah, sacred is the right word. Now,

44:19.280 --> 44:26.800
the problem with liberalism is that it can treat every person as something. However,

44:27.520 --> 44:33.680
the problem it has is the categorization, the, essentially, it's the epistemology and ontology

44:33.680 --> 44:40.400
of it, where it has to reduce each human being to the universal shared characteristics. And so

44:40.400 --> 44:47.280
actually you're kind of reducing all of those differences, the human qualities, the detritus

44:47.280 --> 44:51.600
of tradition that builds up in people. For example, my accent is one example. It's not a universal

44:51.680 --> 44:56.560
accent. It's an English accent. And so we'd have to subtract that in our analysis of how

44:56.560 --> 45:01.440
the three of us are all human. And so we have to slowly whittle away those things that actually

45:01.440 --> 45:06.240
make us uniquely us in order to get to the universal man, which again is another false

45:06.240 --> 45:11.120
assumption of liberalism. There never was one in order to say right now I have a conception of

45:11.120 --> 45:15.120
every individual human person. Because of course, the universal thing is also an individual thing,

45:15.120 --> 45:20.240
because it means everyone. And that's actually, I think the wrong way to go about it because

45:20.960 --> 45:26.240
we do want to be concerned with the individual, but we don't want to reduce the individual to a mere

45:27.600 --> 45:32.720
fungible item that is something that could be produced in an assembly line.

45:32.720 --> 45:37.360
Just something like where we would make a new kind of style of art where we put nobody's face,

45:37.360 --> 45:44.080
but just maybe what color exactly think of the representation of signs of the crosswalk signs

45:44.080 --> 45:48.160
and things like that. It's a universal human shape, you know, so you know, it's meant to represent

45:48.160 --> 45:55.120
a human, but no particular human. And that's where I think the problem of not just Rousseau,

45:55.120 --> 46:02.000
but like Rousseau most embodies this problem, I think, where it's it's a generic universalized

46:02.000 --> 46:07.200
human that has no commitments other than to the ideology in the state that propagates the ideology.

46:08.160 --> 46:14.560
I find myself not having better language to use when I say, actually, I think the reverse is

46:14.560 --> 46:22.000
necessary and we should have a more mythological view of people. So essentially, if we, and I'm

46:22.000 --> 46:27.440
trying to take an aesthetic foundation to explain what I'm trying to get across here.

46:28.240 --> 46:34.160
So you have to, I've not read anyone who's been able to articulate what I'm trying to articulate.

46:34.160 --> 46:42.560
So if this comes across as clumsy, please forgive me. But essentially, we need to be able to frame

46:42.560 --> 46:48.240
ourselves as the protagonists in a story, because every single person in a way is a protagonist in

46:48.240 --> 46:53.440
a story. And the important thing about a protagonist is in a story is not that they are a universal

46:53.440 --> 46:58.800
human, it's actually that they are a unique human, and they're an irreplaceable human, as in you can't

46:58.800 --> 47:04.160
have Lord of the Rings without Aragorn, Gandalf, Gimli, Frodo and Sam. You can't just replace one

47:04.160 --> 47:09.360
of those people, right? They are they are unique, and they will always be unique. And it's the

47:09.360 --> 47:13.760
relationships that they have with the people around them, and the the events going forward,

47:13.760 --> 47:20.800
and the moral, the overarching moral teleology of the thing that makes it what it is in a kind of

47:20.800 --> 47:28.400
holistic way. And so these people don't just exist, they belong in this thing. And actually,

47:29.840 --> 47:34.400
before the Enlightenment, and even afterwards, I suppose, that's how people kind of view the world.

47:34.400 --> 47:38.240
That was the point of these stories. That was the point of telling the Iliad, that was the point

47:38.240 --> 47:44.560
of reciting the Iliad in ancient Greece. That was the the characters are a unique and necessary

47:44.560 --> 47:48.880
component of the story, in the same way that you and the people you love are in unique and

47:48.880 --> 47:53.840
necessary component in your story, personally. And so now we've got away from the idea of

47:53.840 --> 47:58.560
categorization. We don't have to interchange anything. We don't need a universal human.

47:58.560 --> 48:03.920
Everyone is their own story. And actually, this gives us a much more human dimension,

48:03.920 --> 48:08.080
because now we don't have to whittle away all of those differences. Actually,

48:08.080 --> 48:14.880
the differences can be enriched and brought out and fully understood. And suddenly, you

48:16.480 --> 48:21.440
find yourself being more empathetic to that person, because of their characteristics,

48:21.440 --> 48:26.240
rather than to abstract groups, the oppressed or whoever it is. Because an individual, you can

48:26.240 --> 48:31.840
say, look, I can see the suffering, I can empathize, if you know, you can put yourself in the shoes.

48:31.920 --> 48:37.680
And this is, I think, a better way of conceiving of these things, and also allows us to bring

48:37.680 --> 48:44.080
across the set of virtues that the Enlightenment identified and say, well, these are goods for

48:44.080 --> 48:48.400
the individual that gives for the public, they're goods in general, we don't need to be committed

48:48.400 --> 48:56.320
to false rationalistic foundations. And we can hopefully bring these things together and create

48:56.320 --> 49:01.680
a world that actually we like living in, where we don't hate each other for arbitrary reasons.

49:02.240 --> 49:06.880
And the only people that we would hate are people who have actually physically wronged us.

49:07.680 --> 49:12.560
And even then, this is where Christianity comes into it, is let's talk about forgiveness and

49:12.560 --> 49:16.320
reconciliation, justice. What do you think of that?

49:16.880 --> 49:21.920
No, I actually think that this, I think I might be able to give you something to chew on that

49:21.920 --> 49:28.560
might help you think about what you're thinking about. I don't disagree with this conception,

49:29.120 --> 49:34.080
and the fact that this is how humans understand ourselves and each other in relationship to

49:34.080 --> 49:44.080
each other, and that part of the problem is that in the search for universal man in the realm of

49:44.080 --> 49:51.200
differences, like I made the interjection a moment ago about the interchangeable avatars of race,

49:51.200 --> 49:56.080
gender, identity, et cetera, that is so characteristic of we'll call it diversity art,

49:56.640 --> 50:02.640
which is a form of postmodern Soviet realism or socialist realism. I would actually say it's

50:02.640 --> 50:07.920
socialist hyper realism if we're going to just incorporate into it. Well, I mean, it's very

50:07.920 --> 50:13.680
good for corporatist marketing purposes and propaganda as well. But it's a form of socialist

50:13.680 --> 50:18.720
hyper realism, this art form where everybody has no face, but you can tell what color their hair

50:18.720 --> 50:23.120
and clothing tell you what gender they probably are, so they become avatars of identity. But

50:23.120 --> 50:29.200
what this is, this is the search for identity in class, right? And so the other side of the coin,

50:29.200 --> 50:35.040
and I'll come back to the the kind of storytelling thing in a moment, because I think that's

50:35.040 --> 50:41.520
actually huge. And I think you are banging on a very important door, nothing to take away from

50:41.520 --> 50:48.640
that, but it's something to add to it. But this other side of the universal man coin is the individual

50:49.280 --> 50:53.120
and there are some, this is a fruit of the enlightenment that we are thinking of each

50:53.120 --> 50:58.000
other or as each person as the individual, there's this weird tension and, you know, we dragged it

50:58.000 --> 51:03.360
out in cynical theories and talked about it, that kind of if you think of it, that liberalism is

51:03.360 --> 51:09.120
pointing toward the concept that there is something universal about mankind that makes us in a sense

51:09.120 --> 51:13.840
sacred, but at the same time, we are at the end of the day, each individuals, and we can't forget

51:13.840 --> 51:18.400
that. So we don't want to lose the fact that that is a fruit of enlightenment thinking. We're

51:18.400 --> 51:24.880
not just, you know, peons under this Lord or serfs under that. We're not just members of this nation

51:24.880 --> 51:31.120
or members of this church or this diocese or whatever else. We don't think of ourselves necessarily

51:31.120 --> 51:37.760
just in terms of whatever class we've been assigned or cast, depending on how thoroughly

51:37.760 --> 51:43.840
gnostic and monistic the circumstances are. There is a fundamental individual at the bottom of the

51:43.840 --> 51:49.200
pile. And so that weird tension is key, I think, to enlightenment thinking. But what I was going

51:49.200 --> 51:54.000
to point out, I don't know if you, not that I'm a giant fan of Daniel Kahneman by any means,

51:54.560 --> 51:58.000
but I think there's something interesting. Actually, I don't like his expression of it,

51:58.000 --> 52:02.640
as well as I like Joshua Green. So there's these two books. Daniel Kahneman is very famous,

52:02.640 --> 52:06.480
Thinking Fast and Thinking Slow or something or Thinking Fast and Slow. I've heard of the book.

52:06.480 --> 52:13.200
I've never read it though. Yeah. And so Joshua Green has a book called Moral Tribes and they both

52:13.200 --> 52:18.800
present the same idea, although it's the point of Kahneman's book, it's not the point of Green's

52:18.800 --> 52:25.440
book. But the idea is that there are basically two modes of human thought. One is we could call

52:25.440 --> 52:34.080
Thinking Fast, one is thinking slow. Green gives a much, I think, more graspable metaphor for it,

52:34.080 --> 52:38.960
which is a camera on automatic settings versus manual settings. A camera on automatic settings,

52:38.960 --> 52:45.040
you pick it up, you take your picture, comes out good, never great, right? Or great by accident,

52:45.040 --> 52:50.240
sometimes. However, you're sitting there twiddling the lens and on manual mode and you can get it

52:50.240 --> 52:56.640
perfect. You can get the framing, the lighting, the lens, whatever. I'm good to focus. I'm looking

52:56.640 --> 53:00.720
for words and I can't think of them. The bokeh, whatever the hell you want to get. No, no, I

53:00.720 --> 53:04.240
totally get that. Exactly what we want on the manual settings and the automatic will never

53:04.240 --> 53:08.560
quite do it. But the problem is, you've got to set up your shot. I have a friend who actually

53:08.560 --> 53:14.240
used to be a professional still life photographer for commercials and stuff. He told me about this

53:14.240 --> 53:20.000
one time where he spent literally every waking hour for a week taking a picture of a fucking bottle

53:20.000 --> 53:24.160
of Coca-Cola. And the picture that came out is like, wow, that should be in a magazine because it

53:24.160 --> 53:29.040
turns out that's what it was. But he ended up taking like, there's digital, so he ended up taking like

53:29.040 --> 53:34.720
800 photographs of a bottle, tweaking the light, tweaking the light, and twisting the knobs and

53:34.720 --> 53:38.880
everything that was like, you know, this bottle that's more real than real in the end. It's a

53:38.880 --> 53:44.400
perfect photograph, right? And so that's manual mode. And so the reason I'm bringing this up is

53:44.400 --> 53:48.960
our thinking fast mode, according to both of these guys is where we spend most of our time,

53:48.960 --> 53:55.600
more than 90% of our time, almost all of our social time. We are not thinking rationally when we

53:55.600 --> 54:00.080
are interacting with other humans, except to like hash out ideas, which is a philosophical

54:00.080 --> 54:05.120
project. But in our normal like social interactions, how do we guess what we're going to do with the

54:05.120 --> 54:08.720
person? You know, we're face to face, you say something, I have to respond and react. That's

54:08.720 --> 54:15.200
all done in what they call intuitive thought or automatic mode on the camera. And it's therefore

54:15.200 --> 54:20.400
done by heuristics, it's done by that weight of tradition, it's done by those kind of, you know,

54:20.400 --> 54:23.760
either aesthetic or sentimental decisions that you just kind of make.

54:25.040 --> 54:28.880
It's not rational, like you described, I don't make breakfast like you do,

54:28.880 --> 54:31.360
apparently, but like you described making breakfast, right?

54:32.400 --> 54:38.000
Would you just bring up Carl fry or something like that or fry up some thing nobody does.

54:38.720 --> 54:44.320
Some probably involves a fish or some mashdown and bacon sausages.

54:45.040 --> 54:49.680
God, I love sausages though. It's the only British sausage is British.

54:50.240 --> 54:55.120
Thank God for you and your little kippers or whatever you call them. Yeah. So anyways,

54:55.120 --> 55:00.160
the Cumberland sausages. That's so good. Yeah. Yeah. But so anyways, and it's funny,

55:00.160 --> 55:04.800
I live in the Cumberland region of Tennessee, but so I'm all confused when I go to your island.

55:04.800 --> 55:08.160
But you know, I've talked to Peter Rogosian now because I called it your island.

55:08.960 --> 55:14.240
Yeah. Your small savage island nation where I was recently. It was beautiful.

55:15.520 --> 55:22.400
The point being that we have two modes of thinking and that one of these discoveries since

55:23.360 --> 55:29.440
John Locke or whoever you want to hold up as an avatar is that the intuitive mode of thought

55:29.440 --> 55:33.200
is where we spend most of our time, do most of our social interaction, have most of our

55:33.200 --> 55:39.520
experiences that we call human. But the thinking slow portion, the manual mode is where we have

55:39.520 --> 55:43.440
to go and we have to get right answers about something important. And what we have to be

55:43.440 --> 55:49.760
able to do is to tame that. And this is I think the essence of that enlightenment that we don't

55:49.760 --> 55:56.000
want to lose that liberal project that we don't want to lose is we have to tame those intuitive

55:56.000 --> 56:00.640
modes override them very often. Like for example, the impulse to want to be right,

56:01.440 --> 56:06.320
which feeds into confirmation bias and these other biases where rather than going to

56:06.320 --> 56:11.440
disconfirm our hypothesis, which is ultimately what mature science is about, we go to confirm our

56:11.440 --> 56:17.520
hypothesis and thus create a mythology or an ideology for ourselves or around our concept.

56:17.520 --> 56:22.080
Oh, you know, I think it's this guy's in cahoots with so-and-so and I'm going to go out of my way

56:22.080 --> 56:25.840
to go find like every time he was ever in a picture with Bill Gates or something. So

56:25.840 --> 56:31.440
that can prove that they were working together. So sometimes yes, sometimes no, sometimes whatever,

56:31.440 --> 56:39.760
but you get me. And so the rational aspect, if we look at liberalism, and we kind of loosen

56:39.760 --> 56:44.640
our grip on it a little bit, and rather than it being this, you know, age of reason that's reason

56:44.640 --> 56:50.320
becomes the only in the gold standard, it's actually that reason has its domain, and that reason is

56:50.320 --> 57:01.760
the corrective to the tribal class thinking very intuitive default mode. But we can't lose that

57:01.760 --> 57:05.840
because that's the human. That's I think the space that we need to be working on, that there's this

57:05.840 --> 57:12.640
very human intuitive approach, but that you kind of have to keep in the back of your head that

57:12.640 --> 57:16.320
you're probably going to be for navigating daily life. Yeah, great, but you're probably going to

57:16.320 --> 57:20.640
get the wrong answer when it matters nine times out of 10 if you live there, you're going to come

57:20.640 --> 57:27.040
up with bullshit self gratifying self self justifying post hoc rationalization land.

57:28.960 --> 57:35.440
And so there's this and not everybody spends like not everybody is a scientist in a sense,

57:35.440 --> 57:40.720
they are but they aren't. Not everybody spends a lot of time in that. So it becomes that there's

57:40.720 --> 57:46.000
almost these two domains. Are we living or are we trying to get right answers so that we can live

57:46.000 --> 57:52.240
better? Right. And one of those requires tremendous discipline. And that's the ascension of reason.

57:52.240 --> 57:57.360
So when I see liberalism again, I go back to this one axiom, which, whether you believe in God or

57:57.360 --> 58:01.680
not, doesn't matter. It's we're not that we don't have omniscience, we don't have omnipotence, we

58:01.680 --> 58:07.040
don't have perfect clarity and understanding of thought. And so what? And so what we have to do

58:07.840 --> 58:12.000
is we have to be willing to recognize that we're limited and fallible. Christians like to call

58:12.000 --> 58:17.760
it fallen. I don't need a story for why we're limited and fallible. I just think that we're not

58:17.760 --> 58:22.320
as cool as we think we are and are not as smart as we think we are. In fact, I think I'm wrong

58:22.320 --> 58:27.280
95% of the time and the 5% is pretty damn good. Twitter agrees with you on that, James.

58:27.840 --> 58:31.280
Well, Twitter is wrong. It's a thing stopped by everyone. Twitter is wrong.

58:31.920 --> 58:37.440
Literally. What did I say recently? I said that Twitter, it's like, oh, shit, what is it? This

58:37.440 --> 58:43.840
is actually great. It's like upside down Cassandra, right? Cassandra is this myth where she sees the

58:43.840 --> 58:49.360
future perfectly, but nobody believes her. But Twitter is like, it sees the present completely

58:49.360 --> 58:54.720
wrong and everybody believes it all the time. It's like, it's like inverse Cassandra complex or

58:54.720 --> 58:59.920
something. So anyway, I just think that we have to view liberalism as saying, listen,

59:01.120 --> 59:06.640
your natural impulses are going to get it wrong when it matters a lot. So let's tame those. It's

59:07.120 --> 59:10.480
I used to think that it was the ascendancy of reason. And then I started to think it's like,

59:10.480 --> 59:14.320
maybe these guys thought humans aren't very good at this, but it's good when we

59:14.320 --> 59:22.160
try to discipline ourselves for it. And that it became a corrective to our impulses to live in

59:22.160 --> 59:27.920
thinking fast, even at times where we need to step into thinking slow. And again, I'm not endorsing

59:27.920 --> 59:33.920
Conom and Conom's got his own issues. But I mean, anybody in the academic world that's propped up,

59:33.920 --> 59:37.360
I think he's the second most cited author or something like that. Anybody's propped up that

59:37.360 --> 59:42.640
far. Like that's one of my one of my little traditional heuristics these days is like you

59:42.640 --> 59:47.360
said, if everybody's going in a direction with the vaccine, maybe he's great. I don't know. Maybe

59:47.360 --> 59:52.560
this isn't a rational decision, but he's propped up something fake going on over here, right? Like

59:52.560 --> 59:58.160
beware. But that concept though, that we have two modes of thinking intuitive and rational,

59:58.160 --> 01:00:02.160
which in a sense is a mathematician, I'll say are artistic and mathematical.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:07.680
I think there's even like this kind of like this is I'm bullshitting right now. Give me a minute.

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:12.160
But I remember reading something at some point that said that when we do mathematics,

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:17.440
because I'm a mathematician, it crossed my path. It's like you only have one math channel in your

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:23.200
brain unless you're John von Neumann or something. And so like if I tell you go ahead and like,

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:28.080
take the number 37 and square it in your head, your whole focus goes down one path and you

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:33.600
can't do anything else functionally while you do that because it eats up all of your Ram so to

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:37.840
speak to run down that path. But if I tell you to start thinking of artistic things, it's like

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:42.800
you're in like free association land in an instant, you're thinking a million things at once,

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:48.800
once I tap into that side. So these kind of very linear and very like explosive intuitive fluid

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:54.960
sides of thought. And I think that these and how long would it take you to square 37 in your head?

01:00:54.960 --> 01:01:01.040
Like, if you're good at it, like 20 seconds, 30 seconds, if you're Arthur Benjamin, you can do

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:07.040
it speaking of all of our famous Benjamins, the math and magician. He he can do these things like up

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:12.400
to four digit numbers in like an instant. It's really impressive. But it takes a while because

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:17.840
that's a slow form of thought. And I think it's that when you need right answers to social questions

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:23.040
in the human experience, you need to dive into the intuitive. And when you need right answers

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:28.400
about hard detailed things that matter, you have to dive into the rational. And then wisdom becomes

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:34.000
like this capstone that helps you determine which realm you're in and when and which realm you need

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:40.960
as well. And and to purpose, right, to the circumstances. Yeah, like, I don't need to be

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:47.200
try to go be hyper rational with your wife. See how that works out for you. Yeah. Right. It's

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:53.600
sometimes it's just or you're two year old. Well, yeah, right. Just try it. Right. But you know,

01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:00.480
tell your wife that she seems upset. And that's an irrational thing. See how it goes. You know,

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:05.520
it's like irrationality is going to multiply. There are times where you have to know which realm

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:11.440
you're in. And you don't need to like, if you're going to a party, a social engagement, a conference

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:16.560
or whatever, the after meet and greet, the reception, and you're like calculating and

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:19.280
triangulating who you're going to talk to and when you're going to talk to them and why you're

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:25.920
talking. First of all, you're spurting out. Stop it. And second of all, you're living. You're in

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:30.400
the reason mode when you need to be in the intuitive mode and you're you're missing something.

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:37.040
And I think that there's something gigantic here. I think that there is a huge temptation

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:42.480
within liberal enlightenment thought to put this primacy on reason, rather than putting reason

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:48.000
into the container where it goes, which is when we need to slow down and get right answers,

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.880
if somebody's got to have a surgery or something, we need to slow down and get right answers. But

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:55.920
if you're just trying to figure out how to make somebody feel better about the fact that they

01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:00.080
need a surgery, it's not time to start doing calculations. It's time to sit down and put a

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:05.440
hand on their shoulder and be a human being with them. That's honestly exactly how I feel about

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:13.360
this. I can't help but be brought into mind of Aristotle when, really, he summarizes all as

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:19.200
the cardinal virtue of prudence, knowing when is a good time for what is literally the beginning

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:27.040
of all wisdom and the very first virtue. And with good reason, this is precisely how somehow

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:32.960
we've gone two and a half thousand years back to this exact place. Because we're in the same fight,

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:39.360
Carl. Exactly. The human condition never changed. And so very much when he's like,

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:43.440
man is a rational animal, I think that is the correct dichotomy about what a human being

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:48.880
really is in its essence. And it is that I think that the enlightenment has latched to the rational

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:54.160
side, and now it's come to a point where it's stigmatizing the animal side. And the animal

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:59.920
side will happily stigmatize the rational side if that's let alone to its own devices as well.

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:03.120
And so when you were saying how these things need to be in their proper place and use their

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:10.080
proper time, that's exactly right. And the problem that I think the rational side has

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:14.960
is that it can only work in the realm of theory, right? It can only think that's all it does. It's

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:20.640
rational. And so it can't help but categorize the world. But when you start categorizing things,

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:26.800
you are abstracting away from a real animal thing, a real solid thing in the real world.

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:30.160
And it's that where the beating heart is, it's that where the feelings are.

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:34.480
Right. I mean, this is what Hegel said about immediacy, right? You have to get to that. That's

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:38.480
what they're seeking. That's what the sentiment of Rousseau is, is looking for that immediacy,

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:44.320
that true experience, not just to interject. I'm not criticizing by bringing them up. I think

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:50.320
that they're the reason their project has been so successful at screwing up the world in such

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:55.760
horrible ways. French Revolution, anybody, Bolshevik, you know, the legacy is horrific

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:59.440
is because if that's tapping into something extraordinarily real.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.320
Yes. It's something that resonates with people because there is a truth, a kernel of truth

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:13.600
embedded within it. And it is the issue, I think, is that we have allowed ourselves to pretend

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:19.520
the virtue can be done by thought rather than by action. And it is through the exercise of these

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:24.480
virtues that we become the kind of people that we have self-respect for and the kind of people that

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:33.600
we take on respect for others. And so the reason that I'm trying to get away from abstract categoricals

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:38.640
is because they've got this inherent dehumanizing effect. As soon as you start abstracting to more

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:44.640
than one person, then you necessarily have to start removing the human element to a degree

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:51.040
from whatever group you're trying to identify. And this is where I think this is where you

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:56.000
end up with the Holocaust. This is the logical endpoint where it's just a group. I don't know

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.320
any of them and they're all bad because I've calculated why they are bad. And actually,

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:07.120
that's just not real. You know, the reality is if there is a particular person who's done a particular

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:13.120
act that comes with it, a moral judgment that a sensible person would make, then you can take

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:18.080
action because that person is a criminal or a conspirator or something like this. You don't

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:21.840
just have this abstract category that you're applying to a bunch of people you've never

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:27.600
seen and you can't identify. And so it's this way of thinking that we need to find a way of

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:34.640
breaking past. So we can marry up the, and there's a very good way of describing it,

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:41.040
the slow and fast thinking, because it just genuinely represents the rational and the animal.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:46.320
We need to have these married up. These just can't be separate ways and unique ways of looking at

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:53.200
the works. It just is not true. And it comes with significant price. It really does. And

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:59.280
we're watching it now. And the problem as well with the rational side of things is that, okay,

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:05.760
let's assume that everyone is a unique, is an independent sovereign will that is

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:14.320
in the flesh on this earth. Why? Why do they do anything? They don't know, you know? And so

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:18.880
not only is there a falsehood embedded within it that, okay, yeah, actually turns out that

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:24.960
all of your impulses aren't just the sovereign will of its own, making it, you know, in choices.

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:29.760
It's all biological impulses that are being translated into thoughts by your brain that you

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:36.080
desire, ultimately. But it also means you don't feel like you're attached to anything. And it's

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:40.000
these human attachments that we really need to start thinking about, especially in the modern era

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.520
where everyone's on social media and no one really feels attached to any of the people

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:48.240
that they actually live in. We're all parasocial in our entire experience.

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:54.000
Exactly. And it's giving us false senses of belonging. And that's actually really quite

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.880
terrible. And I'm just as guilty as anyone else of doing this. I'm totally guilty of doing this.

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:06.560
But the concept of belonging, what it's predicated on is that there is something

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:12.400
into which you could belong. And this is where the human side of the sentimental side of our

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:18.960
existence is withering away. It's genuinely a concern to me that people in Generation Z,

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:25.600
I see them talking to each other about things that they have no idea about. Like love,

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:30.320
they don't seem to understand the concept of romantic love. They have been conditioned

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:37.120
by the progressive millennials to view every interaction as transactional and not sentimental.

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:41.920
And so these people just don't understand what it's like to feel like they belong somewhere,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:48.400
to feel like someone is uniquely related to them in some way. And it's horrific. And honestly,

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:51.920
I don't know if it's resolvable. I don't know if you can teach someone this

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:56.080
if they haven't been brought up in this way. I mean, I'm genuinely afraid of it, actually.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:02.960
I'm a little more hopeful on that than it can be because of things, you know, growing up myself

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:09.120
and my own things I've overcome as I've matured into what I now believe is a fairly fruitful

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:14.080
adulthood. So I'm a little optimistic about that just to lay your fear. The thing is,

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:18.880
I don't disagree with you about what you're saying. I just don't lay the blame for it at the feet of

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:23.760
the Enlightenment because I go back to that emphasis on the individual that is also there

01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:32.720
that is not present in the same way previously. And so that emphasis on individual, especially

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:39.840
individual rights, which thus defines the individual that enables, I mean, why did Locke say

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:43.600
life, liberty and property? Well, if you can't lock somebody up and you can't

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:48.480
set liberty and you can't kill them, that's life and property, you can't depose them of their ability

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:52.800
to feed, clothe and shelter themselves, then you have a hard time controlling their thoughts.

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:57.040
You have a hard time controlling their speech, which is like the expression of their thoughts.

01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:02.080
And therefore they can be an individual. And in fact, being that he was a pious man,

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:09.840
they can pursue their belief in God without the strictures of a state or some other external power,

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:16.640
possibly condemning them to eternal torment because of what, you know, if you were that state,

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:19.680
you decided I have to believe about God. What if I'm right and you're wrong?

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:24.000
Being the kind of irresolvable question. And if none of us are God, none of us can answer that

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:29.040
question. So none of us has the right to impress that on each other. So this is the individual

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:36.080
is preserved in a unique way by the Enlightenment. But that there is there is a method of going too

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:41.760
far with it. But where I'm seeing, again, I really want to play this blame. And the Enlightenment

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:47.520
carries, as I mentioned, that miasma again, its own set of figures that I think that this is the

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:52.560
problem we have to figure how to resolve is the literally, and I mean this quite literally,

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:57.520
is the Gnostic thread that has run through the modern era into the postmodern that we've never

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:03.600
disentangled. Academics won't touch it. Nobody talks about it. But this idea of

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:12.480
this kind of hyper rationality is the Platonic episteme. This hyper rationality is the

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:18.000
fornumped this idea that are that we're going to lift up where you identify the problem. So now

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.280
we have two people and they become a group by default. And so we abstract, we have two opposites

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:27.280
and that are different, and we try to understand them in some kind of unifying whole. That's the

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:31.440
dialectic of Hegel. He even describes it in terms of apples at one point. They only have a green apple

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:35.600
or a yellow apple and a red apple. How are they the same? How can they both be the same? How do we

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:42.000
dare call them both apples? You know, this kind of thing, this categorization, the idea of obliterating

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:50.080
categories to arrive at immediacy is in fact, in my opinion, the Hermetic project,

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:58.480
which is a Gnostic project that is a huge danger swing and a miss from what, so when you keep

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:02.640
saying it's like, I'm like, you sound a little bit like Rousseau, you sound a little bit like Mark,

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.960
that sounds a little bit like Hegel, but you're like, but no, it's the other way.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.560
And that's I think what we're getting at is that you want a non Gnostic approach to answering

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:17.760
the same questions that are there. And this is why I say that I don't feel a need to lay the

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:23.920
blame at the feet of the Enlightenment. I feel the need to lay the blame at the feet of this

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:32.160
esoteric thread that none of us have pulled out of that story yet. And then my thought is,

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:36.240
I actually like, you know, when you're talking about looking a little bit ahead or whatever,

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:39.600
I don't necessarily disagree. I'm not sure what to do with that yet. So I'm just not doing anything

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:45.920
with it. But I like the idea. I feel like liberalism properly construed and properly implemented

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:50.960
whatever that would mean. So what do I mean by that essential identification of the individual

01:12:50.960 --> 01:13:00.400
and the human freedom secured, etc. Okay, allows for the organic evolution of society without

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:06.240
the selection pressures of, frankly, megalomaniacs stepping in and trying to determine which direction

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:11.520
things are going to go, which is the essence of what the lack of direction means that the megalomaniacs

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:16.080
and the psychopaths will rise to the top without a direction. How do you weed out?

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:23.280
I think I actually, sorry to interrupt, but I this, we seem to be a particularly interesting

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:29.360
point here because there's always direction, right? Direction is it comes from your personal

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:33.760
impulses as in what do we want? As in what do we not have? What do we want more of? You know,

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:37.360
what would be good for us? There's always direction, right? So I'm not worried about that

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:41.440
actually. And there are external pressures that are going to cause trouble that we have

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:48.640
to deal with. The thing that I want to talk about is the the Gnostic thread here, because

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:58.640
there's something about the privileging of reason that I think ends us at the point of

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:06.880
Descartes, where he essentially says, no, the will is the only thing I can be completely

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:16.080
sure exists. And everything follows from that. And I don't, you are right. I want a holistic

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:23.680
approach to the human being, right? The human being is both his body, his will, his experiences,

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:32.720
his memories, his stories, his like relationships, he is this full rounded thing. And the problem

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:39.120
of the enlightenment is I think the thread goes to that place where it thinks of itself as the

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:43.680
only legitimate thing. And I agree with you that there could be something we could call liberalism

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:51.280
that does have a holistic approach. But the way that the philosophy is constituted at the moment

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:56.800
and the emphasis it places on some things instead of other things leads us to a point

01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:03.760
where we, I think, are always going to get the fangs of the parasite in us.

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.200
I think that may be true.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:12.400
Whether we like or not. So this is why I'm interested in beginning at the place that

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:20.160
Aristotle found himself in, actually, and working from there. Because Aristotle believes that

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:26.000
all sort of hierarchy of these things, and they're all appropriate, none of them are stigmatized

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000
in his view. And that actually seems like a more reasonable place to start to be. But sorry,

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:30.560
go on.

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:35.840
No, no, no, it's fine. I actually think that, again, I keep drawing back to this miasma thing.

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:41.680
It's so important to realize. So let's take Stephen Hicks, for example, and you read

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:46.480
explaining postmonarism. And of course, he absolutely blasts Russo as you should.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:53.520
Yes. But then who does he kind of lay at the, who does he kind of like create as the character

01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:58.320
who's sort of the problem, the universal problem that leads to postmonar, Kant, right?

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:03.840
So he makes Kant kind of this arch figure of the counter-enlightenment, right? So it's Kant,

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:08.400
an enlightenment figure or a counter-enlightenment figure. And you go into these online debates,

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:12.960
at least, or you talk to even philosophers who are professionals, and just watch them just like,

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:17.920
you're talking like cat fight, like, you know, is he an enlightenment figure or a counter-enlightment

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:22.400
figure? What this suggests is that there's something else going on. And one of my attempted

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:26.560
resolutions has been that there were two counter-enlightments. That's fine. But as a

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:32.320
matter of fact, these things aren't distinct. The miasma thing is a real problem. You had a

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:38.880
character like Hegel, who is doing certain enlightenment thinking, who is also explicitly,

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:45.440
unambiguously, proudly a mystic. He's just a fucking wizard. The dude's a sorcerer. He's not

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:50.240
even a philosopher, but he does some philosophy. He does some theology. He doesn't do any science.

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:56.160
Let's just not even lie. He's a shithead on that. But you have these characters that are kind of all

01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:59.840
of these things at once. And so why is this thing that you just brought up? It's because there's

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:05.360
more than one definition of reason. That thing where, for Hegel, the word is for nymphed in German,

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:09.520
gets translated. I don't even know what that word means on its own, but it gets translated as reason

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:16.320
with a capital R when Hegel's rendered into English. Not reason with a lowercase R, reason with a

01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:22.640
freaking capital R. And so now you have this same situation that you always end up with when you

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:26.480
have these, whether it's woke, whether it's Marxist, whether it's, what does democracy mean?

01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:30.560
We'll ask a Marxist. It means you're under communism because everybody's equal. So everybody has

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:34.640
equal representation. Without that, it's not truly democracy. What does the people mean? Those people

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:39.120
who support the system? There's double meanings for all these things. I think that when we say

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:44.320
the enlightenment, there's not only just not one counter enlightenment, there's not even the

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:51.200
enlightenment. There's this kind of sprawling mess of different thinkers that you kind of can put in

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:56.480
and out at the same time. Kant being an enlightenment figure and a counter enlightenment figure of one

01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:01.840
type or another, all at the same time. Hegel may be being all three at once. Rousseau, where's he?

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:06.080
Definitely some enlightenment ideas. Definitely informed some of these things that we call the

01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:12.400
enlightenment. Also a blatant Gnostic. Man is born free and everywhere he's in chains. There is no

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:19.760
more Gnostic sentence than that other than I am a Gnostic. You put these things down and it's like

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:24.640
which one were these people? This is why I'm saying we haven't pulled this thread out. In fact, we

01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:30.960
kind of have to rescue liberalism from the long train of Gnosticism that's been running through

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:36.800
it from its beginning because it grew out of the fusion of trying to mess around with the space for

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:42.480
reason, meaning two things at once. Faith, meaning maybe more than one thing at once.

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:48.320
And then mysticism, which is like, oh my gosh, guys, we can transform the world. Maybe we can

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:53.760
transform humans. What does that look like? I don't know. Let's get into some weird racicultism

01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:58.240
and then put a bunch of Jews in ovens. That's where that ended. But that's racicultism and

01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:05.200
this same idea that we can out reason what the world really is. And so that was a rambly thing

01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:11.360
that boils down to I think that there are two definitions at least of reason that they have

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:17.520
threaded their way through the development that we're calling the enlightenment in that particular

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:25.840
meaning the word the that particular article there makes us blind to the fact that what we're

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:32.640
talking about is a much more complicated and organic derivation that sprawled across over

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:36.640
hundreds of years with a couple of hundred years with lots of different kinds of thinkers.

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:41.440
And so that's where like my project with regard to thinking about liberalism

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:47.360
or post-liberalism if we want or going forward or 21st century liberalism or holistic liberalism

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:52.880
which make up words. Let's just throw adjectives. I don't care. My thinking with it is is we have

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:59.520
to get down to the essence of what was trying to be achieved, what something made for enormous

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:04.480
and I don't mean it in a flippant or glib way genuine progress over the last 300 years.

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:10.800
And I know the return dudes with the V can pretend that this progress is all fake and they show the

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:16.000
picture of like a wonderful palace and they're like why do we build these ugly buildings now?

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:23.200
And it's because we don't have slaves. They've got genuinely like actually valid points about

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:28.480
that. There are valid points and there are invalid parts as well. Like I've seen them share the

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:34.240
images of like the Tsarist palaces in Russia that literally bankrupted the nation so that the king

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:38.320
could have his awesome palace. And there's a reason why we don't do that anymore is because

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:43.200
when everybody's actually free to do their own thing, we don't bankrupt nations to build something

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:52.480
except for vaccines or something. But the point being is I just think that there's more than one

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:58.160
meaning of reason, one of which is mystical, which is that science, it's the epistome and say

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:05.520
NTA or the Frenumft and the system, the Wiesenschaft, the Hegel put out. And then there's this thing,

01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:10.560
this is just like with the progression of science. Newton's over here cooking up calculus,

01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:14.320
figuring out the Brachastroni problem or whatever it's called, Bracharistochrone,

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:17.840
that's what it is. And he's over here solving that problem. He's over here developing

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:22.800
differential equations out of his ass, creating physics, you know, mechanics like

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:27.520
unbelievable stuff this guy's doing. Meanwhile, he's drinking mercury so he can figure out how to

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:33.600
live forever, right? Yeah, like, we got some problems here. 400 years later, we're like, oh,

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:39.360
shit, quantum mechanics. And science hasn't even really matured. We have Hegel criticizing Newton

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:45.120
over optics. Well, Newton's optics turned out to be right. Hegel's full of shit. Because we have

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:49.360
this guy that's over here working in his reason. Oh, okay, how could there be seven colors inside

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:55.040
of one color, you know, or whatever he's doing? This is just nonsense. What you have is this

01:21:55.600 --> 01:22:01.520
maturation process of what we're calling the enlightenment. And I feel like we were to the

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:07.200
point where there was where we're really getting to kind of a mature understanding of it. And that's

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:12.240
also when the parasite latch onto the side of it. We're the 30s and the 40s, not to hold them up

01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:16.800
at some special time or whatever. But this is when we really started to like, holy crap,

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:20.640
we've got to pull some of the mysticism off of the way we've thought about some of these things.

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:25.840
And this is kind of why a lot of people look back at the 50s is like this hyper rational,

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:30.640
but in some weird way, really good time is because it's kind of like the peak of the fruit of that

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:36.640
turned out to be positive positivist movement, which is its own complicated thing, and went too far.

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:43.600
But there's, it's almost like we have to let the idea of reason mature and we have to shed off

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:51.120
that Gnostic aspect, which is not reason. It's like the difference between truth and your truth.

01:22:51.120 --> 01:23:00.000
They have like reason and our reason or science and the science. And it's that where I think the

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.880
center play goes. So again, it's, I don't, I don't even know that there's a thing called the enlightenment

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:11.840
to lay blame upon, but to the degree that it's true, I don't lay blame there. I, we've, we don't

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:18.320
know what it looks like when we let it, when we mature it and take this Gnostic aspect and just

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:23.760
hammer it out because nobody talks about it. Nobody, nobody, I mean, it's, it's, it's green

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:30.560
space completely right now. So the, the problem that I think we might have, and I'm not saying this

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:37.840
is definitively, but this has been my impression of it, is that actually it might not be possible to

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:46.160
separate the thread of Gnosticism from liberalism. And so if that is the case, we have to question

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:54.160
what our commitment to the, to the term liberalism is, because actually I think, and there are,

01:23:55.200 --> 01:24:00.400
I think I was guilty of this quite some time. I was emotionally attached to the term liberalism,

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:05.920
and thinking of myself as a liberal. I had attached a bunch of moral sentiments to this

01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:10.000
that made me in some way morally good person because I thought that this

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:16.080
contains something within it. But I think actually we can detach ourselves from the term

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:22.720
and realize that actually this doesn't make us morally invalid. And it also allows us to be more

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:29.040
flexible with what we do here, because I agree with you. There are definitely different kinds of

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:33.440
reason or intelligence. I agree with you, by the way, on detaching from the term as well.

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:36.240
And so this is why I'm happy to use post liberal, because I don't want to,

01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:41.120
I don't want to abandon liberalism, you know, and I never, I never have wanted to,

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:46.960
but it's clear that there is something that's wrong with it. And I think you may have identified

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:53.680
accurately in the Gnostic thread, but I think it is so bound up. I don't understand how it could be

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:59.200
unpaved. I don't see a way, right? So all I'm thinking is, okay, well, let's,

01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:07.680
we can bifurcate here and learn from the experience that liberalism has given us

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:12.000
and craft something that is free of that Gnostic problem.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Right. And so this, for me, is where it's like, I'm trying to, I want to boil down.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Imagine it's like literally we're taking liberalism and putting it in a pot and boiling it down.

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:24.880
And so all of these kind of false assumptions, we don't have to think so much about these.

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:30.400
I mean, we need, we need to address them, but like, what's under them? Why, what's going on?

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:35.760
What were these guys after? What were these ideas chasing? And that's again, I just keep

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:41.600
coming back to it, is that let's start with a simple fundamental axiom, which I think is the

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:44.960
fundamental liberal axiom. We don't have to call it the liberal axiom. The name doesn't matter.

01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:48.880
I'm not at, actually, by the way, don't have an emotional attachment to be identified as a liberal.

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:53.280
I don't like to be identified like as anything. Well, surely it's just James Lindsay.

01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:58.480
That's right. People are liberal. But no, no, no, no. How mythological of you? You know,

01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:04.640
James, that's right. The man, the myth, the legend. That's not wrong. Everyone is, you know,

01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:10.000
but yeah. So the thing is, though, is it's, we're not God and we're not going to be God.

01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:16.640
And let's start from there. What does it look like if we just accept that no human being gets to have

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:22.560
that status or gets to usurp that status and lord it over some other person? In the word Lord

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:27.600
is chosen very intentionally in that expression. What does it look like? What does political

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:33.040
authority look like? What do we have to do to deal with that? What does, you know, what does

01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:38.960
kind of social relating look like under this kind of thing? And what you start ending up with is a

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:43.040
whole lot of libertarianism and a whole lot of Americanism and a whole lot of stuff that,

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:47.440
you know, they stabbed at really well in the Magna Carta. And so, you know,

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:52.160
you're kind of along the lines of those projects when you get to that point. And so,

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:58.400
it also is a fundamental rejection of the Gnostic project. We're never going to be,

01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:07.040
it's not even that we're not gods. We will never become gods. We have no claim to make on that

01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:11.040
level of authority. So then you have questions like, well, how do you decide who gets to be in

01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:15.920
charge? Whether it's politically, whether it's in terms of a project, whether it's leading a family,

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:23.040
well, the answers come down to things like, you know, traditional Moors and which is a question,

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:27.680
but ultimately competence and merit. The people who get to lead projects are people who prove that

01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:33.680
they have the access or the ability to lead a project. As the hard part becomes, how do you

01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:38.800
determine whether or not they have proven such, credentialism is a problem, nepotism is a problem,

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:43.440
people just, you know, going on TV and scamming a bunch of voters and getting elected,

01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:47.600
even though they're frauds is a problem, people being run, you know, like actresses being run,

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:51.040
you know, through deliberate campaigns through things like the Justice Democrats as a problem.

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:58.080
You have ways that that system would be gained, but Jordan Peterson hit something extremely

01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:03.760
important here, that the legitimacy in the hierarchies, if we want legitimate hierarchies,

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:09.920
comes from competence, and that that's an ideal in the sense not in like a platonic ideal, but that

01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:18.400
the higher the level of ordering of a hierarchy, the higher the competence is the fundamental

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:22.880
principle ordering that hierarchy, the less corrupt it is. So those are kind of like two

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:29.120
antagonistic competence and corruption are like literally two antagonistic concepts.

01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:35.280
And so by, if we start with the assumption, so again, what does it mean to be liberal absent all

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:39.840
of the kind of like John Locke and all Montesquieu and all these guys, what are they right absent

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:43.840
all of that baggage? What does it mean? Well, we start with the idea that we're not God, how do

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:48.480
we resolve these questions like who gets to be in charge? Well, we have to defer to merit and

01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:55.040
competence. And what we're what it then becomes is a mechanism that starts to build out legitimacy

01:28:55.120 --> 01:29:00.480
and hierarchies, which is ultimately, I think what the liberal project is meant to be about.

01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:05.600
It's a conflict resolution scheme. It's a mechanism by which we can start to

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:14.480
hash out legitimacy and hierarchies to the best of our ability. It's never going to be perfect.

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:18.960
But the problem is, and this is what I alluded to this earlier, you brought it up earlier. And

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:22.800
when you bring up now, you know, that you had an emotional attachment to identifying as a liberal,

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:28.960
which God knows we know a lot of people, you know, in our spaces that are that way pathologically.

01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:39.280
What I see happening in that case is that people are expecting liberalism to do something

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:44.240
it's not meant to do. It's not meant to give you a story of your life. It's meant to make it so

01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:49.680
the state can't give you one for you. It's not meant to give you meaning in your life. It's meant

01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:53.840
to free you up to pursue meaning where you seek it is not meant to tell you how to operate your

01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:59.520
relationships. It's meant to allow you to pursue that on your own terms, which is freedom and scary.

01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:05.680
And not something everybody wants when I've been to China many times. I've talked to Chinese people

01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:10.720
who obviously live under a tyranny. And some of them are like, please, please, please don't let

01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:15.360
America fall if it falls the world's done. And others are like, we like to be told what to do.

01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:20.080
It simplifies things. I haven't ever run into an individual of this kind, but I just read something

01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:24.320
yesterday talking about one of the impulses underneath communism. Of course, I have it's

01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:28.320
very famous that it gives you the power to punish your neighbor. But there's a lot of people who

01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:33.120
actually don't want actually to get the state to punish your neighbor for you. They don't mind

01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:37.040
being told what to do if it means that their neighbor gets told what to do. And it's not going

01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:41.760
to, you know, they don't mind it. They like that idea. I talked to a guy, one of the things that

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:46.960
radicalized me in like 2012 or 13, I was talking to a grad, a guy I went to grad school with,

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:52.560
and he was, we were, you know, it was atheist days, right? Back in the day. And I mean, you were,

01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:56.560
you were in there, I was in there and the whole thing and there's like all the feminist bullshit

01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:00.720
that was just out of freaking control. And I was talking to this guy about his frustrating me. And

01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:06.640
he was like, yeah, but I look forward to our feminist overlords. I'm like, wait, what? And he,

01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:11.200
I'm like, this is some some beta orbiter stuff. And he's like, I'm like, what? And he's like,

01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:15.600
yeah, when women are telling men what to do, that's one less thing for me to think about.

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:19.680
And it turns out that's exactly the rationale I heard in China. So it's not everybody craves

01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:24.000
this. It's scary to be free. But if you start believing that liberalism is going to answer

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.440
questions for you, like what your meaning in life or what it's supposed to be or what your

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:32.640
aesthetic experience is supposed to look like, then of course it's going to disappoint you.

01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:37.280
It's designed literally to make sure authorities can't do that to you.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:42.000
And so at this point, do you mind if I introduce you? So I think this is very interesting because

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.360
I think it's at this point because Benjamin, I know you've been interested in the concept of

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:51.440
tradition for a while and the traditions you've been tradition. Yeah, just the spaces you've

01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:57.120
been engaging with recently. And I think this is where the concept of tradition actually begins

01:31:57.120 --> 01:32:02.240
to apply because yes, I agree with everything you just said there, James. But I'm also aware

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:10.560
that what you've said is particular to a people, a place, a time, and the result of a continuous

01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:17.120
and contiguous history. Because like you said, not everyone values that. But the way that was

01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:24.640
framed was very much rationalistically, right? This was the, as I was saying, ideas are actually

01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:31.680
a product of a time and place. I don't mean this is a criticism either. It's a very natural for us.

01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:39.680
post enlightenment people to frame our ideas in exactly that way. And what you've

01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:46.000
constructed there is a kind of ideological frame that we can pick up and place down.

01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:51.680
But that's not how I think we should think about it. Because as you referenced,

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:56.640
there's a reason that we speak in English, there's a reason that we care about the things that we

01:32:56.640 --> 01:33:00.480
care about, as the post-moderns would say, we're placing value on the fact that we're even talking

01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:05.840
about them. And there's a reason that you trace that lineage back to the Magna Carta. Because what

01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:13.360
we are talking about really are the values of England. And this is something that, of course,

01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:18.640
why wouldn't America hold the values of England? It was founded by Englishmen. Why wouldn't these

01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:23.520
continue to be propagated generation after generation? And so now we're not thinking in

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:29.280
the abstract realm of ideas, we're thinking in the concrete real world in which we live.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:36.640
And I think that changing the locus of where we begin like that actually allows us to

01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:44.320
center ourselves in a way that allows us to properly understand the people around us as well.

01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:49.680
Because what, like I said, I agree with everything you're saying, but I'm also aware that I only

01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:54.720
agree with that really, because I'm an Englishman. If I was some Iranian imam or something, I'd be

01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:59.120
like, no, this is preposterous. Why would anyone agree to any of this? God's law is God's law.

01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:05.840
They would just think you're a kook, a loon. But to me, it seems like second nature. And of

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:09.360
course, I agree with all that. Why wouldn't I? Who could think differently? Well, the Chinese

01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:18.240
person, an Iranian. And so if this is the problem with remaining in the world realm of the abstract,

01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:24.400
and so if we make it particular and civilizational, it also means that we actually have to draw

01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:30.960
boundaries, right? It actually means that we have to define where it started and where it stops.

01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:37.520
And the range that we have within that is where we are. And so now we actually don't need to

01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:45.280
find ourselves groping in the dark for what hierarchy should look like. You are right. I mean,

01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:50.400
the hierarchy will be based ultimately on either corruption or competence. That sounds absolutely

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:57.760
correct. And they are in contradiction. I agree with that. But also, there's a way of being

01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:04.080
competently corrupt that I think someone like Vladimir Putin actually deeply embodies. He's

01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:10.880
obviously a very competent guy, but obviously he's an evil villain. So they aren't mutually exclusive,

01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:19.280
even though they're in contradiction. But we don't value having a competent villain in charge.

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:26.000
We value having someone who might be actually incompetent, but at least they're virtuous in

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:34.160
charge. That would be preferable because of our cultural situation. And so once we have this sort

01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:41.280
of continuum that we can see ourselves within and situated in the human experience in a time,

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:47.600
in a place, then I don't know if we can call that liberalism, because as you said, liberalism is

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:54.640
this body of ideas. But it is definitely a product of this time and space. If you are to trace the

01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:58.880
genesis of liberalism, and Stephen Hicks just says, well, it begins in England. And there's a reason

01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:03.680
for that. Because what, and this is what Michael Oakshaw's perspective was, was just the distillation

01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:08.560
of the English political tradition. And it is through these political traditions that we could

01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:15.120
just carry on, as we do, intuitively and instinctively. Because you are right. I mean, like

01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:20.320
I said, we can rationalize why these things are good. But the rationalization will really be for

01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:26.400
people like us and those foreigners who agree with us. And so now I've had to make a distinction

01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:34.560
between these people and those people. And that's more realistic than having the abstract set of

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:39.840
ideas. I'm not even sure where I'm going with this point, really. But it feels important to sort of

01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:46.160
take the ideas out of space, the abstract, the realm of the forms, and put them in the world.

01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:50.880
This is where they belong. And this is who they belong to. And this is why they belong to these

01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:57.520
people. And you are right. They came into being for a reason because of royal oppression against

01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:02.880
the peasantry and against the nobles. The argument was, well, God has mandated this. Well, we'll see.

01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:08.480
We'll see who's right arm mandates it, who God is really with on that case. And it turns out

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:14.880
that it was actually with the people, with the lower orders, and not just with the king. And

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:17.840
this had happened a few times, actually. And eventually, the king gets his head cut off

01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:24.480
until we get to this negotiated settlement, effectively, that becomes the sort of English

01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:30.560
and then American constitutional system. But that is the product of layers and layers and layers of

01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:36.800
tradition and experience and personal negotiation between people. And so this is why I return to

01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:41.440
the kind of mythological view of this thing. It's not just something we can abstract away,

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:45.840
and then we can't give liberalism to Afghanistan. And they don't have the institutions,

01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:49.840
they don't have the traditions, they don't have the thoughts in their head, the instincts

01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:54.880
to make this thing work. It's just, it's a false oath. It's not their mythology.

01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:57.200
But so... Just one interjection.

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:03.360
When you bring up the mythological and the sentimental, it's not just a negative,

01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:09.760
it's not just romance, it's not just faith. We can see like Hegel embarked on a project and

01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:16.160
J.R.R. Tolkien embarked on a project, a massive project that have stood this test of time and

01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:22.640
influenced huge amounts of genre. But they were both operating probably mythologically,

01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:30.160
both oriented or dealing with the same kind of imaginal forms. But Hegel abstracted them into

01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:35.440
ideas. Tolkien put some ideas in there, but nested them in character. So he oriented his

01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:41.520
imagination differently than Hegel. So the Gnostic tradition, I think, is a type of creativity.

01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:51.120
It's a type of Western man, a man who is trying to achieve godhood. And that project is incredibly

01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:56.400
ambitious project and will drive people to do great things. Now those great things might not

01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:05.760
be good, but those ambitious people, that prompt, become god, will create great things, terrible

01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:10.720
things too. And that's like the tolerance of sociopaths question. How much do you tolerate

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:16.240
sociopaths because they'll create, say, industries by doing horrible things that benefit us all

01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:21.920
massively even though they do massive evil in the process of doing it? I mean, that's a hard question.

01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:29.840
But seeing that that type, the Gnostic type, is always like in dialogue, has always been creating

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:37.840
artistic works alongside these other types of artistic works, poetry and storytelling that

01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:43.040
expand the tradition. I just, I think that there's a dialogue there.

01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:49.360
Artistic is a strong word there for the Gnostics, in my opinion. I don't feel like there's very

01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:55.680
much art going on there. But I mean, this is a story in Genesis. Genesis chapter three is about

01:39:55.680 --> 01:40:03.280
this. So this is a human dialogue that's not going away. Definitely not going away. But what I'm

01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:09.440
worried about with this contingency of culture, I do agree, we're not going to just take liberalism

01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:17.440
and plop it down in Afghanistan and it's going to take off. It would have to grow there, right?

01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:22.720
It would have to be that the idea is underneath it, land and people in the right way and they

01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:27.840
articulate it in their own contingent context, et cetera. And it has to grow and flourish and

01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:33.440
whatever on its own and kind of grow in and through that context. I don't disagree with that. But I

01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:37.280
will be as culturally chauvinistic as I have to be about this particular tradition. And I don't

01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:42.480
think it's just a product of the fact that I happen to live in it and happen to think this way

01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:46.480
and happen to have been born into a tradition that thinks this way. I look around the world

01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:52.880
and as Donald Trump rightly pointed out, many whole countries. And I see that there are better

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:58.960
and worse answers to these questions of how human beings, which I do not think are, despite our

01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:02.400
cultural differences, despite our different histories, I do not think that we're functionally

01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:09.520
that different as organisms as that animal side. If we're going to ground our future political

01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:14.800
projects in the human, I don't believe in universal man, but I do believe that the

01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:24.320
boundary of that which is human as a collection is a bounded set. There's a

01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:33.120
gulf between that set and the set of chimpanzees that is enormous. It's not a small difference.

01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:39.360
It is a constrained system that defines what it is to be human and the similarities within that

01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:45.840
does define kind of a imaginary and abstract, yes, universal concept of human. But whatever

01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:54.320
that boils down to, it seems to me literally not just intuitive or obvious or anything,

01:41:54.320 --> 01:42:00.320
but just evidentiary over the past 300 years that where these values we can say are these

01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:06.160
English values or as Stephen Hicks often frames it, the English enlightenment or Scottish

01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:11.600
enlightenment, even as a Southerner, I'm United States, I'm just kidding, my family is from New York,

01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:20.640
but mostly actually my family history is partly English and Scottish. It's a little more British

01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:27.360
highly than that. I've got some German in me too, watch out, the bugs are coming for you. But I've

01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:34.960
got this whole view that this English enlightenment tapped into fundamentally human values that

01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:40.400
somehow attached to what Sam Harris kind of comically called human flourishing and moral

01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:46.240
landscape 15 years ago or whatever. I want to reclaim the term human flourishing. I think

01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:52.160
that's a perfectly noble goal. Right. But the thing is, I don't think that these ideas are,

01:42:52.160 --> 01:43:00.480
I don't go as far into the postmodern condition as to accept that this is a totally contingent

01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:06.880
cultural phenomenon that these ideas worked. These ideas did work because these ideas in

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:14.880
this culture because they grew out of this culture. Right. And so there's that aspect of it. But where

01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:20.800
these ideas have been successfully implemented in other places, they have led to similar levels

01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:25.760
of flourishing. Like I said, when I go to China, you have people who desire to be ruled. You have

01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:29.520
those people in America too. I talked to those people. They're all over that. My friend, for

01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:35.120
example, who had master's degrees coming out of his butthole, but he couldn't get a job and he's

01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:39.440
wants women to rule over him and whip him or whatever hell he wants. I don't know.

01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:45.280
Some weird shit. Just a brief interjection. It's not just the export of the ideas,

01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:50.240
but it's the virtues too. You can't just have liberal ideas without some sort of Christian virtue.

01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:55.040
Well, I don't know that it has to necessarily be, I mean, I'm not going to say it has to be

01:43:55.280 --> 01:44:00.080
humility, patience. Every time that you guys bring up a virtue, it's a Christian virtue.

01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:03.040
Every single virtue that you guys give up is canonized.

01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:07.840
I would also go further and say that this isn't contingent either. I'd say that Christianity

01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:13.760
codified those virtues extraordinarily well in a cohesive system that's extremely pro-social.

01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:18.160
But these, I think, again, Aristotle wasn't a Christian. These are human virtues.

01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:21.440
No, but the Christians were very influenced by Aristotle.

01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:25.360
Well, of course they were. They took that from him. He didn't take that from them.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:30.160
So just as a quick interjection, because I find this fascinating because I wonder

01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:34.400
if this isn't the cultural difference between me as an Englishman and you as Americans, right?

01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:42.080
Because, no, no, I'm serious about this because Americans do have a habit of seeing themselves

01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:46.720
as universal men because America is, of course, the most successful project of liberalism.

01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:52.880
And it's done phenomenally well because historically, it was very rooted in the English

01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:57.040
tradition of liberalism, which is, as Oakshott put it, just the distillation of English political

01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:02.000
practice into theory. But of course, if you've got a bunch of people who have been born and raised

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:06.160
as Englishmen and then calling themselves Americans but still having the common law,

01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:12.400
still having these values of accountability and justice and political decentralization,

01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:17.200
all of the traditional values of England just replicated on the American continent,

01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:22.640
then it makes sense that that would work because, of course, to the people, and this goes down to

01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:28.400
the way the language is constructed, the kind of institutions we have, the family values that we

01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:34.240
share and that you're raised with, these things are radically different in Britain than they are

01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:39.680
literally just a hundred miles away in France. France has a totally different set of social

01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:45.040
values to the English. And it's actually remarkable. And the Germans have a totally,

01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:48.960
totally different set of intellectual values to the English. And then that's not even talking

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:52.640
about what the Italians, the Spanish and the Greeks are like. And so it's actually kind of

01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:55.840
crazy that I had a conversation with a Greek friend of mine the other day. And I was like,

01:45:55.840 --> 01:46:01.840
mate, if your cousin drove to your house and he was in a stolen car and you recognized the car

01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:07.280
and someone when he worked makes cars, would you tell the police and say, no, that's crazy,

01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:11.200
right? You would tell the police, right? I would tell the police, you have to tell the police.

01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:15.840
But that's because we have literally got radically different social values. He would see that as a

01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:22.000
form of betraying his cousin. I would see that as a form of betraying the rule of law entirely

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:28.000
in this country, right? I would know you, you, you have committed a crime, you have not been

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:32.400
virtuous, you have not done the right thing. And I would be doing the right thing by contacting

01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:36.640
the police and it would be right that you be punished for your theft. That's a very much

01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:40.720
an English set of values. That's not something that they value in Greece, right? Probably not

01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:45.840
in America, I don't know, right? That's not, no, like, bro, you should probably go give that back.

01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:50.160
Like you'd have a conversation with your cousin, but you sure as hell wouldn't go around your

01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:55.440
cousin out. Well, if he was intransigent about it, you know, maybe, I think you probably should.

01:46:55.680 --> 01:47:06.160
But the, the, the point is though, the American perspective has always homogenized Europe.

01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:08.400
Although it's because of the nation of immigrants.

01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:12.240
No, no, it's not just that. I think it's the remoteness from Europe as well.

01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:12.640
That helps.

01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:15.440
And, and the, it's like our best thing.

01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:20.560
Well, when you're a lot closer, you start to gain a better understanding of actually

01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:28.160
how particular and parochial our value system is. I mean, for example, the English have never,

01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:33.840
as a culture, have never been particularly haunted by the ghost of Faust, right? Whereas the Germans,

01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:38.480
and he's been mentioning many Germans in this, they're deeply riddled by it. They, they, they

01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:41.600
don't know what to do about this concept. But there's never been a problem with the English,

01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:46.640
because the English actually have always been quite humble in this idea that actually, of course,

01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:50.400
God's there. And of course, we're not gods. Of course, you just look at what's in front of your

01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:55.600
face and you do the best you can with what you have. Because the English, I spoke to a German

01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:59.760
professor a while ago, he was like, well, you're, you're intellectually lazy. And it's like,

01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:04.160
yeah, that's, that's true. That is actually quite true. We're not stupid. We're just intellectually

01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:08.880
lazy. The Germans are not intellectually lazy, though. And this is one of the problems with

01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:14.160
Kant. Like if you look at what Kant is trying to do, he's essentially trying to formulate

01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:21.200
a technique for looking into the mind of God and say, right, what is a categorical moral imperative?

01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:26.320
Only God can set a categorical moral imperative. That's nonsense. No one, no human being could

01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:29.760
possibly do that. But of course, it didn't come out of the mind of an Englishman. It came out of

01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:35.600
the mind of a German. And I wonder if this Faustian spirit is the Gnostic element that is running

01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:44.000
through this. And so when we see this, this exchange of our souls in exchange for unlimited

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:49.680
wisdom and power, well, this is essentially what the transgender movement is asking for.

01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:54.720
Yes, yes, yes. Like we want to be able to do it. And so you can see the Faustian German spirit

01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:59.760
being embodied in this movement, but it's very alien to the English perspective. And of course,

01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:04.720
America being an English country means that it is, I think the parasite that you were trying to

01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:09.440
describe earlier that you, you know, you were saying that this is, and so, but when you put it in

01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:16.400
this perspective, you can actually name where it's come from. You can name the people, you can name,

01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:21.200
it's not just an abstract thing. But then it means that you have to kind of police your own

01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:26.240
boundaries, right? You have to actually, we should do things in the English way because this is what

01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:31.040
we feel is right. This is our prejudice. Or you can, you can do a little empirical if you look

01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:35.680
at how these different cultures, let's say France, Germany and Britain, how they scaled

01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:41.200
when they were exported to other places or when America was started. Like what, which traditions

01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:47.040
from Europe stabilized at scale and the English stabilized at scale and maybe the Catholic,

01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:52.960
hold on, but... But this thing, which traditions from Europe? There is no Europe, really. That's

01:49:52.960 --> 01:50:00.480
the thing that like half of, well, more than half of the Americas is Spanish or Portuguese.

01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:05.200
And that is utterly alien. You know, that's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. So something

01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:10.640
in the Spanish tradition scaled and was able to stable, I mean, more or less, they have a lot of

01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:16.880
problems with Communism, stuff like that. Tyranny. But... Tyranny scaled. And something was unique

01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:22.400
about the way that the English tradition scaled and was, you know, it's in Australia, it's in

01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:28.880
Canada, it's here, right? So maybe Germany can't scale, but it can scale within the English,

01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:33.040
right? Maybe, right? Do you see what I'm saying? Like the body politic?

01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:36.480
The Germans should be in charge of kitchens. They shouldn't be in charge of countries,

01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:39.760
because German food is wonderful and German governance is diabolical.

01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:45.680
The other way around, of course, applies to England, right? English kitchens are terrible,

01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:50.240
but again, English governance is wonderful. And this is what we're trying to achieve with

01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:54.720
Magna Carta, with the American Constitution, with liberalism in and of itself as a project.

01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:59.200
But this means we have to be able to identify what is not

01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:04.560
what we're looking for. And actually, you know, now I've been able to bifurcate these things,

01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:08.640
say, right, okay, you are right. It's not just the Enlightenment as one giant thing.

01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:11.440
There are lots of different places where Enlightenment's were going on. And, you know,

01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:15.760
cross-pollination of ideas comes back and forward. And we are suffering from one of these

01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:17.360
cross-pollinations at the moment.

01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:20.720
Right. French and German cross-pollinating into English and Scottish.

01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:21.520
Absolutely.

01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:23.760
And this is David Stocking's point.

01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:27.680
Correct. And this is against Stephen Hicks, where he's talking about Germans and bad Germans,

01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:31.520
and more bad Germans, is like the title of one of his chapters. If you haven't read into the

01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:36.160
Swabian pietist movement, which was a southern German mysticism movement, that it's like,

01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:40.320
within the broad conception of Europe, it's like the longest

01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:46.800
holdout in mysticism as the modern era kind of persisted. And this is,

01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:50.800
Hegel was trained at one of their seminaries. He was trained in the so-called Lutheran.

01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:55.200
Yeah. So the Swabia, you know, the southern portion there of Germany,

01:51:55.760 --> 01:52:03.280
Swabia held out with some occult magic for a very long time, well into the 19th century,

01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:08.160
well into the 19th century. And that's where a lot of these bad Germans and more bad Germans

01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:13.760
happened to come from. But the influence there of mysticism was much more profound than you had

01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:18.880
in England. That's probably why this spirit of Faust, and of course, Géritha was one of the

01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:24.720
characters who was swept up in all of this. Just a quick thing there. England, in this sort of

01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:29.200
time period, suffering dramatically from Puritanism. Yes, burning the witches.

01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:35.840
Opposite problem. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah. And so what you actually, if you haven't looked

01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:39.520
into the Swabian pietist thing. No, I'm going to put it in the brows of it.

01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:45.600
A lot of these so-called Germans and bad Germans, you want to look up a character by the name of

01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:52.480
Friedrich Oettinger. I can't ever say his name. It's O-E-T-I-N-G-E-R, right? Oettinger,

01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:56.560
or it's O with a frickin' umlaut, which nobody can pronounce except Germans.

01:52:57.120 --> 01:53:01.760
Yeah. And so this guy is one of, he's a teacher of Hegel. This is a very important character

01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:07.600
and understanding. Also, another kind of German mystic much earlier is Jacob Boma,

01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:14.320
which is B-O with an umlaut, H-M-E. These characters are extremely influential in the

01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:19.360
progress of this broad German enlightenment, which is where you're getting this kind of

01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:24.240
Kantian thought, you're getting this kind of Hegelian and Marxist thought. A difference with

01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:29.280
American culture to British culture, besides the fact of this Greek cousin loyalty thing, which

01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:33.680
we have a surprising streak of, kind of the fundamental American value if I had to kind of

01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:37.920
boil it all down. Just a quick thing there. I mean, we probably do here, but I think that

01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:42.560
if you approached it as a philosophical conundrum, almost every English person would say,

01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:46.320
well, of course you should tell the police. When I listen to your accent, I hear you say that,

01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:50.640
but if you were speaking cockney, I don't think you would. Yeah, well, that's what I'm trying to

01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:55.200
have at home. I think they would concede that that is the value that they know that they should

01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:59.120
uphold. Whether they do or not is a totally different question. Obviously, not everyone

01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:02.880
here is saying or anything. Well, the thing in America, when I said we're a nation of immigrants

01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:07.680
a moment ago, is the fundamental American value is, oh, you're an American? Great, get a job.

01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:12.080
Like, which is, I don't give a shit about you, do something productive.

01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:15.120
And that's kind of what binds us all together. It doesn't matter if you're Muslim,

01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:17.120
it doesn't matter if you're Buddhist, it doesn't matter if you're white, it doesn't matter if you're

01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:22.560
black, you're here, you're legal. Great. Shut the hell up and get a job. Like, that's,

01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:31.040
you know, we, that's deep, isn't it? It is. It enables us. It also enables us, though, to,

01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:35.760
as I said to somebody the other day, where some intersectional shit was on Twitter and I just

01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:42.160
replied kind of glibly. And I said, can we just get back to a time when I could like people in

01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:48.240
particular and dislike people in general? Yeah. Yeah. And I think like, I want to like cool

01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:52.720
people in particular because I got to know them and I got to hear their ideas. But this is that

01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:59.920
rampant like, shut up, get a job, do something productive, be somebody. And also you're an

01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:03.760
individual and that's what I'm going to respect in you is what you've done, not where you came

01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:07.120
from, not what, not even what your traditions are. Oh yeah, these are your traditions. Cool.

01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:10.960
Let's have a barbecue and find out about them or whatever. Let's hang out. Do your,

01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:14.640
do your fest. Let's come. Let's all have like Greek day or whatever. Whatever happens to be,

01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:19.600
doesn't matter. But it's like, at the end of the day, though, if you're an American, it's like,

01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:25.360
shut up and get a job. What are you doing? That's our value. Yeah, this is the American tradition.

01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:31.280
This is, which is why it taps into that idea that there is something that's not

01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:40.240
the exact idea of the universal man. It's definitely not universal. This is not how

01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:45.600
Italians think, right? Unless they come to America and they get told to shut up and get a job.

01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:54.000
No, no, no. They'll do it because they're forced to do it. But that's not the wellspring of their

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:58.720
culture. No, I understand. I understand. It is the wellspring of English culture, right? It is.

01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:03.440
Exactly here. Get a job. Stop being a loafer. Other people, you know, don't rely on them. They

01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:06.720
should rely on you. You know, you should do your part for the rest of the community rather than

01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:13.120
have them do their part for you. These are very parochial values. That's the thing.

01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:17.760
The product and work ethic, yes. Yeah, these are very parochial values. And so this is the,

01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:22.800
this is the problem, I think, inherent in liberalism is if, because now we're talking

01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:26.640
about things in a totally different way, right? Instead of constructing an abstract set of

01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:31.520
ideas that connect together in a certain way and suggesting that this could be universalized.

01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:36.560
Now we're talking in a particular way and saying, look, we're actually, we exist in relation

01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:41.920
to other groups of people. Essentially, you're speaking in a more Europeanized way, right?

01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:48.240
Because I think the American project being a propositional nation actually contains kind of

01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:55.680
this problem where you guys fall into abstractions. Whereas in Europe, we are not propositional

01:56:55.680 --> 01:57:02.400
nations. And so we are used to the tradition, the long accumulated acclimate, long

01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:10.880
accumulator, cultural baggage that we've had with one another, right? I know what a Scott

01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:14.320
is going to say to me. I know what a Frenchman is going to say to me. I lived in Germany for eight

01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:19.120
years, right? I know, I know every German thinks before they open their mouth, right? Because

01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:24.240
they are all the same in many different ways. But they're also all very different to what the

01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:28.400
average person in England is like, right? And they're all lovely, by the way. I've never met a

01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:31.920
German I didn't like. But that's because I never put them in charge of the country.

01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:41.920
And I swear to God, I'll go to my grave believing this. But you realize that these differences

01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:49.680
are really important and they matter and they are tangible. And what's more is you begin to

01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:55.200
build a relationship with the differences. And it's probably the same with Americans and Mexicans

01:57:55.200 --> 01:58:02.080
actually. Because I mean, I personally don't view Mexicans as Americans. The blacks are Americans,

01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:06.160
the whites are Americans. The Mexicans are not Americans, they're Mexicans. And it's because

01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:11.840
they come from the inquisitorial legal system. They come from the Mediterranean family system.

01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:14.560
They come from a different religion. They speak a different language.

01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:18.960
Oh, by Mexican, you mean the Latinx? No, no, just Mexicans.

01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:24.480
People from Mexico are not Americans. They are Mexicans, right?

01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:28.560
You said American in front of Americans who mean the United States and we got confused.

01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:31.680
You meant Americans like American continents. Okay, we're clarifying.

01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:34.640
No, no, I mean like people from the United States, right?

01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:40.800
Mexicans from the United States. No, no. Mexicans have a different legal system.

01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:44.400
They have a different family structure. They have a different religion and a different language.

01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:53.680
Correct. In Europe, you would never call that, you know, you like that, you're essentially saying

01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:59.120
that these are Spanish people, right? Mexicans are Spanish people. You're English people.

01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:01.200
You're not the same. They're not the same. They're different.

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:02.640
Okay, I see what you're saying. Yes.

01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:07.520
And so it's, so when, you know, when they're like, Oh, Mexican Americans, I know you're just

01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:10.000
Mexicans who live in America. You're not Mexican Americans.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:15.360
Well, see, you're, we have a completely different way of thinking about America.

01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:19.360
And we have a problem with the border, you know, but we have so much cultural mixing.

01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:24.560
We don't think of America as white Anglo-Saxon European. That's just one strain.

01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:26.400
I'm not, right?

01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:33.280
It's, it's, see, now you are abstracting into a category already there, right?

01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:37.120
Because what I'm talking about is America is so abstract. That's the problem with America.

01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:40.080
We're, we're not as proquel as you guys.

01:59:40.080 --> 01:59:44.960
No, no, it is. That's exactly the problem. And it's because America is a propositional

01:59:44.960 --> 01:59:50.160
enlightenment nation that's built on liberal, liberalism itself, liberal philosophy. And so,

01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:57.440
but there is a thing that other people outside of America recognize as an American,

01:59:57.440 --> 02:00:04.560
and it doesn't mean white. It means American. And that doesn't mean Mexican, right? Like,

02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:07.920
I don't know how to describe it. Like, like I said, the blacks are Americans,

02:00:07.920 --> 02:00:12.320
but also the whites are Americans. And there are, you know, people who are born and raised America

02:00:12.320 --> 02:00:17.040
in American customs and traditions, who have never been in another country who are not black

02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:21.760
or white, but are American, right? But people who move to America from another country and like,

02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:26.160
yeah, I just want to get a job and, you know, work hard and make money. That's not enough to

02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:29.520
make them. No, no, no, I agree. I agree. I agree. Okay. I know what you're saying now.

02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:35.120
Yeah. Yes. Yes. That is true. There is a cult. There is a distinct cultural value,

02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:40.160
cultural suite of values that defines that which is American.

02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:46.000
But also, it's not just the values. It's about how you are raised. It's about the communities

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:50.880
you're raising. No, I hear you. The customs, you know, the character. Yeah, I agree. I agree.

02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:54.640
The one thing that America has this that Europe doesn't have, and I think it's actually the

02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:59.920
lack of this is kind of crippling Europe at the moment, is this incorporative ideology

02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:06.320
that is becoming an American, right? We don't have that. That's exactly what I was wanting to

02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:12.320
suggest off of that is, yeah, because you can have that character, whether they come from Mexico

02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:18.800
or they come from China, whether they come from, I guess, your primitive island, and they can become

02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:24.480
American. They can kind of adopt that suite. They can join the tribe.

02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:32.000
Well, yes, in a sense, but Benjamin had a wonderful point, though, when we look at how,

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:38.720
what happens empirically when these particular sets of values get exported,

02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:46.160
formerly by empire, but not as much in the literal, not in the literal sense by empire,

02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:51.120
by anybody but China anymore. But we have these kind of weird economic empires and so on. We

02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:56.400
thought, allegedly, we thought we could transform China into a kind of more Western liberal nation

02:01:56.400 --> 02:02:02.240
by exporting business values, which they seem to have judoed on us. Turns out we didn't study our

02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:06.480
martial arts before we went to the center of martial arts. They acted Chinese about it.

02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:13.040
A little bit, or yeah, among others. That's not an insult. That's just an observation.

02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:25.040
I mean, there's more to it than this, but the fact of the matter is that when we export these

02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:35.200
values, we see improvements. And that doesn't take away from somebody like in America. I don't see

02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:40.160
anything that takes away from your ability to be German or Mexican or whatever as you become American,

02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:49.200
which is a very interesting thing. Having known people from all over or from all different

02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:57.200
backgrounds, who at the, I don't know how many Iraqis, for example, that I've met, who become

02:02:57.200 --> 02:03:04.640
American, they come, they immigrate, they go through naturalization, they become legal citizens.

02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:10.560
And so you have these guys, their accent never goes away, their kind of cultural

02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:16.080
demeanor doesn't change because they were raised in these things. And yet, they're walking down

02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:22.400
the street literally in a suit made of American flags, like waving an American flag, shouting

02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:27.600
about the 4th of July, quoting Thomas Jefferson. And there's something about this where they become

02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:33.680
uniquely Iraqi and American at the same time. And that in corporate development, and I think

02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:38.160
you're right, it is crippling Europe. And it's, I think, why you guys have fought with each other

02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:43.360
the way that you have so much. And America, I think, was founded in part, looking over at you

02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:49.920
guys and being like, not you specifically as in English. No, no, no, you're up broadly with the UK

02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:54.880
kind of as an appendage of that. I know we don't get too much into whether or not it's European.

02:03:55.760 --> 02:04:02.000
And saying like, not this way, American man, you know, let's let's try a different path.

02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:07.200
And that's why I said that, you know, oh, you're here, you're legal, get a job,

02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:14.240
become such a constitutive thing for what it means to be American. And it's also,

02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:20.160
it's not with the like the Australian tall poppy, keep your head down, mate, kind of attitude.

02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:25.200
But there is a certain like, it's, it's much more New York City, shut the fuck up,

02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:31.920
you know, kind of attitude in America of kind of a humility. Unlike, again, it's in Australia,

02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:37.520
they cut each other down and nobody's allowed to be cool at all. Yeah, I know you. Yeah, I've been

02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:44.320
to your island. But we don't, it's about knowing your place, though, right? And this, this is,

02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:50.240
this is the difference between the rest of the Anglo sphere in America. But the, this

02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:55.440
Incorporative Ideology is a remarkable technology. But I think it's only possible because America

02:04:55.440 --> 02:05:02.080
is an explicitly propositional nation. And so what, what, what I'm, what I mean, then, is

02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:07.040
essentially America has a moral responsibility never to build a McDonald's anywhere other than

02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:13.840
America, right? Because what you're doing is you're not being sensitive to the fact that

02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:20.960
actually this is an intrusive cultural institution that begins to subvert and undermine

02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:27.840
other native cultures that are not based on this kind of customary traditional propositionalism

02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:32.720
that is not prepared to deal with it either. Because why would you have thought about this

02:05:32.720 --> 02:05:38.800
in any way, shape or form, right? So it America can't help but undermine the traditions of other

02:05:38.800 --> 02:05:43.440
countries all over the world. And the only reason I think that plays like China are kind of immune

02:05:43.440 --> 02:05:48.080
to it is because they're essentially affected by the Germans. They're, they're not into it by the

02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:52.400
way. Well, yeah, yeah, sure. But like, you should go and you should see why they have any antibodies

02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:58.000
then is because they are, they're currently occupied by German ideology, you know, and I agree with

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:02.640
the German ideology part there. Yeah, it's, it's, but it is, you know, it was invented by a German.

02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:08.560
And so it's, that's the only reason they can resist it in any way or, or shape it to their

02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:14.960
own ends. And so, I mean, they covet it and they dress like they covet it and don't know how to

02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:21.200
covet it correctly. It's not as bad now as it's matured a little. The Nouveau Rich in China,

02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:28.640
the first times I went, I mean, it was, you know, the most garish, you know, you pick whichever

02:06:28.640 --> 02:06:33.600
brand Gucci, I don't even know my brands that you're supposed to be all the big ones, right?

02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:37.920
They're obnoxious symbols, the G's and the D's and the things and the whatever.

02:06:37.920 --> 02:06:44.720
We're not supposed to mention the Balenciaga one anymore. Every piece of clothing on a person

02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:50.480
was a different one of them with the brand logo as large as it can possibly be. It's like a guy

02:06:50.480 --> 02:06:57.760
wearing a jacket that's a giant Ferrari with like Lamborghini pants, like to show off how he's part

02:06:57.760 --> 02:07:03.760
of all the big expensive brands and like everybody was like that. And it's toned down now. I mean,

02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:10.080
just the most obnoxious kind of, and it was a phenomenon of being the Nouveau Rich phenomenon

02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:16.720
and the covetousness of, of the West. And they have this weird, like, exploitative

02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:22.880
ass, like mentality about it. But at the same time, they also, it's like, if you're a white American

02:07:22.880 --> 02:07:26.960
in China, they worship you and use you at the same time and hate you at the same time. It's a

02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:33.280
really weird phenomenon to kind of experience. You're getting major positive and negative racism

02:07:33.280 --> 02:07:38.800
at the same time against you, for sure. Yeah. My sister worked in South Korea for a while,

02:07:38.800 --> 02:07:43.200
and she had a friend over there who he had a beard and Koreans would just come up to the

02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:47.600
street and just touch his face. That's happened to me in China. Yeah. And I was just like,

02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:52.080
that is horrific. You know, I can't imagine strangers just coming up and touching my face.

02:07:52.080 --> 02:07:57.360
They'll come up with a cell phone right in your face. Yeah. I mean, all kinds of really strange

02:07:57.360 --> 02:08:02.960
things. I mean, on the more fun side, like pretty girls will just run up to you and take selfies

02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:09.680
with you for no reason. Yeah. But this, but this is what I mean when essentially we have to make

02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:16.800
the Americans understand they are parochial and their view of mankind as universal is tied to the

02:08:16.800 --> 02:08:22.880
liberalism and it's also damaging other cultures, right? But I don't, I don't, as maybe it's my

02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:28.480
Americanness, I just don't see a problem. Well, there's the flip side with wellness. No, no, no,

02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:34.240
that is, of course you don't, because it's what you're used to. It's what you are familiar with.

02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:40.640
It's what you expect, right? But I'm, I've, this, this is what the return guys are talking about,

02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:47.280
but not articulating it well enough. It's, it's this kind of cultural imperialism that

02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:53.360
seems justified when you say, well, we have a better culture, but you've got to remember that

02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:57.360
everyone thinks they have a better culture. And what you really have is just more power,

02:08:57.360 --> 02:09:01.520
right? Because if it was the other way, there'd be like, well, my Latvian culture is just better

02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:05.120
than your American culture. That's why I get to impose on you. And so it's actually not

02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:12.080
sentimental in any way. It's actually now rationalistic. And actually, the way that the,

02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:19.440
the European powers have been have forced us into sentimental relationships with one another,

02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:24.640
because of the lack of over single power domination of the continent. Actually, if you look at the

02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:28.800
European nations, they're all roughly the same size, you know, they're at least all comparable.

02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:36.400
And so it's kind of forced us to have some form of respect for that other culture that we don't,

02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:41.360
and so we, we've got a saying in, in England is when in Rome, you do as the Romans do,

02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:48.880
but that's not something Americans believe. And it's destroying civilizations. And so it's this,

02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:53.840
but I genuinely think it's tied to the, the American liberal experience of the world,

02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:57.520
thinking of themselves as universal men and anyone can come and be an American,

02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:02.320
actually, no, I don't really think that's true. And also, I think that that concept is being

02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:08.160
exported in a damaging way to other people. And so I think that I think a lot of it is why

02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:13.920
there's a fundamental resentment against America, because I like, I like loads of Americans,

02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:20.320
I like loads of Americans. But also, I can see why a lot of people don't like Americans, you know,

02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:24.480
and so, I mean, it's probably because I'm English, and therefore we've got very, very,

02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:30.160
almost harmonious values and sense of humor, and I'm used to American culture. And so,

02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:34.880
yeah, I get along really great with Americans. But I do understand the complaints against America.

02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:39.760
I think that those vaguely sympathetic. Those complaints are actually working themselves

02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:46.560
out within America. When we have the democratic establishment, the deep state, whatever it is,

02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:52.160
they think that they're superior, that their values are universal, and they despise the parochial

02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:58.800
Americans. And they're worlds apart. And so one of the tensions between the

02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:03.840
left and the right in our country, which we project out of the world, is that universalizing

02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:09.040
all-consuming bureaucratic mindset, and then this like localized red state-ish,

02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:18.400
more rural uniqueness that you are explaining as America at large is doing the rest of the world.

02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:24.640
No, and this is why I'm so totally in support of like the MAGA movement, you know, not so much

02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:31.120
Trump himself, but the people that he is representing. These are the sort of people that

02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:35.680
in Europe, I would recognize as just my countrymen, you know, they're just my fellow Englishmen.

02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:42.800
And these are the people that I don't want to see the left destroy. You know, the left will

02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:46.960
destroy this unique traditional culture, and that's what it is. And that's what we have in

02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:53.280
Europe. And so we have to get out of the mindset of rationalistic universalism to be able to appreciate

02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:57.600
that that's there. Now, that's not to undo any of what we were talking about at the beginning of

02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:01.360
this conversation, because honestly, I agreed with almost all of it. I think you'll agree with

02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:08.240
the next thing I'll say, but carry on. Okay. We need to be able to have a rational perspective

02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:12.800
on the world, obviously. But I think that should include the appreciation for the

02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:17.120
native traditional cultures that we have. See, so I don't think that the left has a

02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:22.000
rational universalist perspective whatsoever. I think they have a Gnostic universalist perspective,

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:26.160
which is they know better and everybody has to be that. And I don't feel like that's actually

02:12:26.160 --> 02:12:31.760
fundamentally American at all. I don't think Americans, no, it's not at all think. Yeah,

02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:36.320
it is German. That's right. They have a systematic philosophy. That's why they

02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:41.120
shouldn't be heads of states ever. You can go to your grave. I'll go with you, maybe not to your

02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:45.840
grave, but in agreement, it'll be a group grave, I'm sure. We can, we can, we're all gonna die on

02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:49.360
some hill, some time. We can, yeah, we can tell them on Louise right off the side of that one

02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:56.000
together, holding hands, the whole thing. But it is, but that's, and again, this is that Swabian

02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:01.120
pietist thing, because it so informs what we see as German philosophy, because the German systematic

02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:08.000
philosophies grew largely out of that, which was a Gnostic kind of attempt to fuse Gnosticism and

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:11.920
the kind of emerging enlightenment science and the emerging enlightenment philosophy

02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:19.120
in the German context. So I hear what you're saying. I think that these things should be

02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:29.120
allowed to play out organically. If that, I don't think that destroys, it does damage or transform

02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:34.640
or change traditional cultures, but I don't think it destroys societies or even cultures. I think

02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:40.000
it allows them to change with time and if you want to be contingent about it with the

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:44.560
contingent circumstances of that they find themselves in the times and places and communication

02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:49.040
modes that they have. That's not a problem, but it's when you have this imperialistic

02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:52.800
that I have a problem with. So let me stop you there because

02:13:55.280 --> 02:14:02.000
this again, feels like an opinion that is centered in the sort of rational liberal perspective.

02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:05.360
I'm not trying to just constantly pull you up on it, but

02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:12.240
traditional cultures do change over time. The great example of that was Queen Elizabeth's funeral,

02:14:12.240 --> 02:14:18.880
where you could see traditional uniforms and costumes from each era of Britain's history

02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:26.320
marching in procession. It's kind of preposterous in a way, but it's also a testament to what we

02:14:26.400 --> 02:14:32.000
have been through as a country. It's not that traditional cultures don't change.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:37.200
The problem is that the American rationalism that I agree is infected with German Gnosticism,

02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:42.080
I totally agree, but this is being exported around the world and it's kind of liquefying

02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:48.640
these cultures. So it becomes impossible to have a true and sincere commitment to

02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:55.440
the traditional way of life in that place. I think actually it is a problem and it is

02:14:56.160 --> 02:15:00.400
kind of anti-human because at least one thing we can say about the traditional cultures is

02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:05.440
they're authentically human. They're just that kind of human. There are lots of kinds of human,

02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:10.240
but it's authentically a human experience. This is where I don't go with you.

02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:18.400
Which is fine. We don't have to agree obviously, but this is where I don't go with you.

02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:26.080
I just impressed that again, we can call it the English side and the German side or whatever

02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:36.560
we want to call it, but the Gnostic aspect is not necessarily woven thoroughly through what it means

02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:45.280
to be American or liberal. It is a thing that has grown up with it and is parasitic upon it.

02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:52.560
And I think that our values of universalism as we were talking about earlier created an opening

02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:59.120
by which say through critical race theory and the literally Marxist perversions of civil rights

02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:06.400
that have created this kind of monstrosity. I think that we can make it very evident that this

02:16:06.400 --> 02:16:11.760
German idealism or this Gnosticism by asking where does it propagate? Where does it scale?

02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:17.440
It scales within bureaucracies specifically, which means corporations, which means

02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:23.680
nominally efficient systems and it propagates in media, it propagates in colleges too.

02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:30.080
And if we see that wherever these ideas are transmitted, they're probably transmitted through

02:16:30.720 --> 02:16:35.440
business, through forms of business, through forms of interaction and a culture. And what they blend,

02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:44.400
it is a type of person. The cubicle man is a type of person. It's not a type of person,

02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:49.520
but he's thinking in a universalized form. He's thinking in terms of bureaucracies,

02:16:49.520 --> 02:16:52.320
thinking in terms of what did you say? Abstractions.

02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:58.800
Abstractions by just chopping people down into a little functionary but fungible. He just thinks

02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:04.480
in that way. And that way of thinking is, again, it's very good at doing certain things.

02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:12.880
But it also propagates, I think Carl's critique is that it puts every individual

02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:19.760
into a blender and it erodes societies. But when we go back to the question that you posed at

02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:24.400
the beginning, James, about there's this beast that we have to defeat, if you do want to tie it

02:17:24.400 --> 02:17:29.440
to Gnosticism and then see where Gnosticism propagates through the systems or the cultures,

02:17:30.720 --> 02:17:37.360
then we can see how to create cultures or systems, corporations, and states that are immune to it

02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:43.040
that still have the same kind of functionality, that still train people, that still inform people,

02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:48.000
and that still rule people, but are still immune to that whatever this mind virus is.

02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:54.000
I mean, it attaches to centralization of power and monopoly is what it attaches to

02:17:54.000 --> 02:18:00.320
extraordinarily efficiently. And so whatever you're looking forward to, and I actually think that one

02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:07.200
of the reasons besides this kind of civil right parasitism that we cannot ignore, it cannibalized

02:18:07.200 --> 02:18:11.920
civil rights movements from within, became very strong and emerged as kind of a destructive

02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:16.800
dragon that's burning down societies. The woke problem, I mean specifically with the identity

02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:26.400
politics, what I've referred to as identity Marxism more specifically, it cannibalizes or it attaches

02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:32.080
to, I should say, to centralized power and monopoly. So we have to be thinking in terms of, I think

02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:37.360
that other than just that, that's where I was going with it, sorry, I think that one of the main

02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:45.120
things that has happened is that because of the rapid changes that came, structurally speaking,

02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:51.680
in every culture, this is not even a cultural argument, due to the rapid transformation of

02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:58.800
technological communications technology in particular, but also, so that's big tech,

02:18:58.800 --> 02:19:04.400
basically, but also financial technology, these two sectors of the economy rapidly changed,

02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:12.640
rapidly gained the kind of monopolistic power, because they were ahead of whether it's legislation,

02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:17.200
whether it's out of culture, they were ahead in their developments of everything else.

02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:22.960
They gained this kind of power, I was thinking about this yesterday, that it's the kind of power

02:19:22.960 --> 02:19:29.280
that corrupt or evil governments covet, or maybe we should just be more realistic and say that all

02:19:29.280 --> 02:19:34.640
governments covet. They covet the kind of power that the tech industry and the financial industry

02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:40.080
were able to accrue over the past 20 years due to technological transformation that we haven't

02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:46.480
been able to answer yet. What does it look like going forward? I think that the liberal project

02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:50.560
of decentralization of power that nobody deserves political authority, so we're going to

02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:54.480
decentralize that. Nobody gets to answer questions, does the final say, well, this is just how we do

02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:58.160
shit around here. Nope, we're going to ask the question. I think that while that does have a

02:19:58.160 --> 02:20:09.360
corrosive or a subversive or a acidic dissolving kind of effect, or can, it also prevents the

02:20:09.360 --> 02:20:13.280
ability for this thing to take over, but the reason that it was able to take over was because

02:20:13.280 --> 02:20:18.560
new technologies emerged. I think I've hit it. I think I've hit it. You are right. There is a

02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:26.160
parasite. You are absolutely right, because the distinction, I think, should be made between

02:20:26.160 --> 02:20:30.960
English and French liberalism, because English liberalism is built on negative rights, of course.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:37.600
What the king can't do to you, and this, of course, comes from the medieval tradition of

02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:45.760
essentially the Anglo-Saxons fighting against the Norman occupiers. That manifests explicitly

02:20:45.760 --> 02:20:54.000
in negative rights. However, the French view of liberalism, as we know as Rousseau, manifests in

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:58.560
a series of positive rights. In fact, it's almost an entirely positivistic doctrine when you get down

02:20:58.560 --> 02:21:03.760
to the base of it. You can literally see this in the formulation between Locke and Rousseau,

02:21:03.760 --> 02:21:08.320
whereas Locke thought we sacrificed a portion of our natural rights to protect the rest

02:21:08.320 --> 02:21:12.480
through the creation of a government, which, of course, then is subject to negative

02:21:13.120 --> 02:21:20.000
behaviors, negative restraints. Rousseau believed we exchanged our natural rights for civil rights,

02:21:20.640 --> 02:21:26.160
and that's a positive perspective on rights rather than a negative one. That strikes me as the

02:21:26.240 --> 02:21:36.800
parasite itself. The problem, though, is that that really inflames 20th-century civil rights

02:21:36.800 --> 02:21:42.640
doctrines, because essentially the Civil Rights Act would have to be one of those key points where

02:21:42.640 --> 02:21:53.040
you point to and say, look, that's the parasite. It has to be grounded back in the very English

02:21:53.040 --> 02:21:57.760
declaration that Thomas Jefferson wrote down and following Locke, of course, and then tried to live

02:21:57.760 --> 02:22:03.280
up to and fail that they exploit. It has to be grounded correctly. I think this is where, not

02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:07.440
that I'm a huge fan of Caldwell's book, The Age of Entitlement. I do like it. I think it's an

02:22:07.440 --> 02:22:11.760
important book, but where you actually see with the Civil Rights Movement that there was this

02:22:11.760 --> 02:22:15.600
split. And in fact, the problem in the United States is we have two constitutional orders right

02:22:15.600 --> 02:22:21.680
now, two fundamentally different, irreconcilable constitutional orders. One of them is, in fact,

02:22:21.680 --> 02:22:28.080
an entitlement state that is this French Enlightenment or French liberal positivistic

02:22:28.080 --> 02:22:34.560
state. I don't think that, I don't know about the Civil Rights Act themselves, but the judicial

02:22:34.560 --> 02:22:38.480
interpretation of those that followed very rapidly, the enactment of the Great Society

02:22:38.480 --> 02:22:44.160
with Johnson and going forward, these things explicitly took the path that he's outlining

02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:48.240
as the Asian entitlement. And these things explicitly became the pathway by which the

02:22:48.560 --> 02:22:52.800
virus was able to start to cannibalize the liberal tradition. And I think that this is

02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:58.560
absolutely crucial for us to understand, to start unwinding, because now when we understand it this

02:22:58.560 --> 02:23:04.480
way, we have one massive advantage. Not only do we get conceptual clarity, we can start to identify

02:23:04.480 --> 02:23:10.400
unique judicial decisions that took us down the wrong road, which means that those judicial

02:23:10.400 --> 02:23:16.320
decisions can be brought to review. We just had the huge thing with Roe v. Wade, but you start

02:23:16.320 --> 02:23:22.080
looking at things like in universities, Bakke versus, what was it? Is it the Regents of the

02:23:22.080 --> 02:23:26.160
University of California? You start looking at that, you start looking at employment like Duke

02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:30.880
versus Griggs Power. I think that's what that's called. You start looking at those,

02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:37.600
there's a handful of these cases, like kind of landmark cases. You can figure out which ones

02:23:37.600 --> 02:23:42.480
they are, because the critical racers point to them obsessively. And you can figure out which

02:23:42.560 --> 02:23:47.040
ones they were that took us down this path. And then those going under judicial review can actually

02:23:47.040 --> 02:23:52.560
take, not the Civil Rights Act necessarily themselves, which could be rooted in our 14th

02:23:52.560 --> 02:23:56.880
amendment, which can be rooted back to the Declaration of Independence. But all of the judicial

02:23:56.880 --> 02:24:02.080
interpretation that came after those that created this second constitutional order that were,

02:24:02.080 --> 02:24:08.400
this parasitic, pseudo constitutional order that we go under, where we are now reinterpreting what

02:24:08.400 --> 02:24:14.000
the Constitution was intended to mean, or what law is intended to, what the civil rights laws are

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:20.720
intended to say. In particular, here's one of the little manipulations, protected class. So

02:24:20.720 --> 02:24:25.840
civil rights law says that race, for example, is a protected class. That's not the same thing as

02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:30.800
saying certain races are protected classes of individuals, right? That's a completely different

02:24:30.800 --> 02:24:38.080
conception of what a protected class means. And when we disentangle these, we actually

02:24:38.080 --> 02:24:45.440
can find a path out of this through means, while post liberal cultural renewal may be

02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:51.600
a valuable project. We can find ways that are strictly within the liberal legal tradition

02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:56.880
to unwind this mess. Where again, like we said earlier, nobody has to become a revolutionary

02:24:56.880 --> 02:25:04.480
to get out of this. So this I think is best exemplified in the bake the cake controversy,

02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:11.200
right? Because this seems to me to be the perfect example that the state is going to force someone

02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:15.440
to bake a cake against their will, because it would be discriminatory for them not to.

02:25:16.640 --> 02:25:23.840
That's the, it's such a perfect exemplification of positive rights in action. I get to force you

02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:32.160
to do something or else, right? That's the total inversion of the English liberal tradition,

02:25:32.400 --> 02:25:35.680
what I consider to be the proper liberal tradition, like we were trying to think of.

02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:39.840
You see that in the conversion therapy bills too, where they took the concept of forcing somebody

02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:44.560
to change their sexuality, being wrong to questioning somebody's gender identity to be

02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:51.520
wrong, right? Yes. But the thing is this, what this means is that you will be opening up a space

02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:57.440
where it will be allowable for people to be bigoted, right? Because it will be that right. You

02:25:57.440 --> 02:26:05.200
can't tell not to be. But of course, it will also mean that you don't have the parasite saying,

02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:10.560
right, now I've been given a license to force you to do these things. Why can't I just use

02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:16.320
this license to force you to do a whole bunch of other things as well, right? You know, and the,

02:26:16.320 --> 02:26:23.840
the, this is when we become the government's job to rid the world of bigotry, like, well, that's

02:26:24.720 --> 02:26:30.960
approximately 1968. Thank you for asking. Yes, that's exactly. That's the positive

02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:34.880
right. That's, and that is the parasite that gives itself totalitarian license over society.

02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:39.840
Actually, I'm, I'm glad we've, we've hammered on this actually. But I mean, it does mean you will

02:26:39.840 --> 02:26:47.600
find, you know, a shop with a Nazi side. But who cares? Well, I don't care. I'm totally liberal

02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:52.640
about that. You know, it's like, I know I'm not going to shop there, you know, and like, I actually

02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:57.280
am persuaded by the capitalist arguments on that. It's like, no one's going to shop there. And,

02:26:57.280 --> 02:27:04.080
but this, and this in fact ties nicely into my theory of social moral sentiments, which is

02:27:05.200 --> 02:27:09.360
people in the community will exert their own kind of moral pressure on that person.

02:27:09.360 --> 02:27:13.760
They're like, oh, you're the guy with the Nazi sign. I'm not going to shop. What piece of

02:27:13.760 --> 02:27:18.560
shit you are, you know, piss off. I'm going in just any other shop that doesn't say no blacks

02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:23.600
or no Irish, you know, on it. And so I do think you will get this kind of moral corrective measure.

02:27:23.600 --> 02:27:27.120
No Irish. Is that a thing where, where you're from? Do you, do you guys have that?

02:27:27.120 --> 02:27:28.960
It was the thing where you came from. That was the thing where we are.

02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:33.200
Okay. You guys don't have like pro Irish legislation in the 60s coming down where

02:27:33.200 --> 02:27:38.640
you guys are forced to adore them. Okay. No, that was, you can start potatoes planning.

02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:43.440
No, no Irish was assigned. That was an American. That was totally American.

02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:46.160
Maybe we should have stuck with the no German. I don't know. I'm just kidding.

02:27:46.160 --> 02:27:50.080
Yeah. But the point is you just put that on the Capitol and left it there.

02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:55.360
But, but did it have to be legislated that the no Irish signs were taken down or did they just fall

02:27:55.360 --> 02:28:00.720
out of favor? That, you know, that's, that's the perennial question. I mean, that literally is

02:28:00.720 --> 02:28:03.760
the question at the heart of what was going on with the civil war. So I don't know that we're

02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:10.640
about to answer that one. I just don't know. Well, it takes a certain amount of humility to,

02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:15.680
well, I guess it takes a certain amount of hubris to try to shape culture to say we,

02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:20.240
our culture are, we are no longer going to behave in this manner. And maybe sometimes

02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:24.640
that's a good thing where you force people to behave differently. Maybe there are good uses

02:28:24.640 --> 02:28:29.280
to put that. But once you give that power, this is the old kind of tired, or once you give that

02:28:29.280 --> 02:28:34.480
power to the government, then they can do that. And they actually have to do that indefinitely

02:28:34.480 --> 02:28:38.720
to maintain their cutting edge power. And that's why you have the civil rights going all the way

02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:44.160
down into for some reason, children being exposed to grown men and women face, right?

02:28:45.120 --> 02:28:45.600
Yes.

02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:47.280
It's progressive in that direction.

02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:52.400
But this, this is, this is the point though, like, I agree that it would be

02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:57.440
far better to have a system purely of negative rights. And that would be not only sustainable.

02:28:57.440 --> 02:29:02.880
I don't think that would actually have an acidic effect either, because it would be tolerant of

02:29:03.600 --> 02:29:07.680
things that you didn't like. You know, you, you would have to be like, well, look,

02:29:07.680 --> 02:29:11.120
that's just the way they do things. You'd effectively arrive at the when in Rome,

02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:15.840
do as the Romans do perspective, you know, you let them do what their thing. And, you know,

02:29:15.840 --> 02:29:19.600
you might not agree. But then it's, then it's a social issue. So then it's for all of us to

02:29:19.600 --> 02:29:23.200
have a conversation about, say, well, look, actually, why are you saying that black people

02:29:23.200 --> 02:29:27.840
can't come to your shop? That's awful. You know, how, you know, what an awfully stigmatizing thing

02:29:27.840 --> 02:29:31.280
to do that would be, you know, and so we can agree that that would be a terrible thing to do

02:29:31.280 --> 02:29:37.600
without having the state, essentially, and the Ben Shapiro at gunpoint. I mean, technically,

02:29:37.600 --> 02:29:42.720
yes, you know, it's a bit hyperbolic, but yes, technically, you got to go through a lot of dorks

02:29:42.720 --> 02:29:47.760
to get to the gun. Yeah, I know, I know, you really are more acceptable. I get some more

02:29:47.760 --> 02:29:52.400
functionaries than dorks, but I just hate it when he compresses down everything into right now,

02:29:52.400 --> 02:29:58.720
it's a gun. So come on, Ben, you know, come on, you know, it's an extreme way of framing it. But

02:29:59.680 --> 02:30:03.920
but then, but then we're into the realm of being human, right? Then we're into the realm of consideration

02:30:03.920 --> 02:30:08.880
and empathy and dealing with each other like human beings rather than having a bureaucrat

02:30:09.600 --> 02:30:16.160
telling you what you have to do. So, you know, that's that's my view, I suppose. I don't think

02:30:16.160 --> 02:30:24.400
I disagree with that at all. That was an amazing conversation. I have to get off to work. That's

02:30:24.400 --> 02:30:28.640
why I'm wrapping it up. And I'm sure that you guys need to do other things, but thank you both

02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:34.800
for blowing my mind and stretching my bladder. That was fascinating. Yeah, mine too. So I'll

02:30:34.800 --> 02:30:40.560
link links to your work in the description, but James got new discourses and Sargon runs

02:30:40.560 --> 02:30:45.440
Lotus Eaters. You also have YouTube, both have YouTube channels, which are fascinating work.

02:30:45.440 --> 02:30:49.600
So yeah, they're good ones. No, they're great. If we do say so ourselves.
