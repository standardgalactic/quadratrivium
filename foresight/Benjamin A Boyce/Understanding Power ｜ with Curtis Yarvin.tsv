0	7640	One thing that you said during one I can't remember which one you said that you would you should write a science fiction novel
7640	12920	But you you don't want to write fiction. You don't think that you're good. I'm not I'm not I'm not a good fiction writer
12920	14920	Yeah, but I was thinking and
16200	23160	Like in the style of fadress or a meal or like some sort of dialogue where you're talking to you're talking to the student
23160	25160	You know cuz I yeah
25280	27280	There's I mean
27400	33080	Sure go on go on well you talk about like one of your big ideas is this this monarch
33560	39600	But I don't I don't get a sense of who that monarch would be like what it would his character be like you talk about the system
39600	46080	But I wonder like if you get a bad guy in the system. How do you know like from your perspective like what virtues?
46640	52080	this this yeah, I mean I think I think people try to sort of
53760	55760	There's a lot of
56040	59000	Fear there and people try to sort of overplay
60160	64000	People sort of overplay the problem which is like somewhat
65240	67560	banal in my view
67560	70040	I mean, you know one way to think about it is
70560	77040	If you look at the fortune 500 companies, right? There's 500 of them because that's why it's the fortune 500
77640	79040	and
79040	84840	You know the smallest of them has certainly thousands of employees
85760	87760	And so you've got
88280	90280	Sort of 500 men and women
91400	95720	From that world who are experienced in holding that kind of
96440	101200	Responsibility and if you look at their sets of like virtues and vices
102000	105640	they're probably mostly pretty similar and
107120	108600	You know
108600	113760	Some of the ways I sort of regard people's kind of fear of monarchy is
114760	116640	They sort of
116640	123960	Imagine you're picking the CEO of Chipotle, right? And you're like first great priority is he's not gonna run
125160	128400	Come up and with an evil scheme to like poison the burritos
128920	135360	Because clearly he's the CEO so he could order poison put in the burritos could be a slow acting poison
136000	138960	something right and and it's like the the
140400	142400	executive search team when
143240	146000	They pick the Chipotle CEO
147320	151960	Does not really worry about we got to find someone who's not gonna poison the burritos and
153080	157920	So like, you know, your bar is just a good bit higher than that
157920	166320	And so, you know, I don't know who the CEO Chipotle is. He's probably fine. He's probably I mean, I guess, you know, the thing is that
166600	168600	There are
169280	175680	One of the ways people talk about the job in Silicon Valley is to describe the two kinds of CEOs
176040	182360	Sort of people will say wartime CEOs and peacetime CEOs. That doesn't mean these companies are actually making war
182360	186600	It just means that a peacetime CEO as a CEO who's
187480	193360	Basically has something that's executing on a smooth keel and kind of needs to keep it forward
193720	200840	Moving forward and executing sort of smoothly. So if you look like in terms of Apple say Steve Jobs is as a wartime CEO
200840	203960	And Tim Cook is more of a peacetime CEO, right?
203960	210360	Which is not to say that he's not making tough decisions or tough choices every day, but he's not really
211080	219160	You know someone that you would want in there if their mission was to like entirely change what Apple is and so
219760	226000	To a certain extent when you're establishing any kind of a new regime, that's a kind of wartime
226840	228560	situation and so
228560	234440	You need someone that's a very very dynamic. That's willing to like rip up a lot of pieces of paper
235040	238920	and like a no say or a naysayer like somebody
238960	245640	Yeah, like or yeah, I mean, but even even you know, I would you call even must Elon Musk
245680	252680	You know a naysayer, you know, Elon Musk is someone with a lot of initiative who basically can make things happen and
253560	259640	You know the role of a peacetime CEO is sort of more to like preside over something that's working
260000	265880	Smoothly, which is why if you put someone like that in a position where large changes need to be made
265880	267880	You don't really have the right person
269400	273520	But you know the thing is that it's just not like we sort of
274400	280840	A company the job with this like mystical air in some ways and it's actually
281560	288080	It's a you know governing is or should be a pretty banal thing
288680	291800	It's like it's gotten sort of a lot of like
292680	294680	you know
296280	301520	Very big romantic ideas associated with it and there's a lot of power there
301600	306680	There's there's a lot of power there, but but the thing is that you know when when you
307760	309760	when you have
310400	312240	mechanisms for
312240	316680	putting someone in that power that basically sort of
318040	320040	depend on
321800	323800	Like a kind of
326080	330080	Certain like if the sort of the main
332520	336200	Problem with a lot of the
338840	346760	A lot of 20th century governance has a very high crazy level and when you look at basically the very high crazy level of
347200	350360	20th century governance you basically see that
351240	353240	There are crazy incentives
354600	361280	Driving the way that people both get to make these decisions and crazy incentives driving them
361520	364000	when they're making these decisions and
365360	369480	Normally, it's best to see like the
371000	375440	People who wind up in those slots as kind of
376520	381920	Their craziness is in general constructed by those processes or those
382920	391040	You know sort of like their hands are sort of tie. Yeah, the climate or the structure their hands are sort of tied in terms of
391880	397000	how saying they can be and I think that people think of like
397880	399880	sort of
400240	403200	Like people have been exposed to so many
404480	407440	Romantic ideas of governance that they don't
408320	412080	Really even have an idea of what sanity is
412080	420080	I mean, what is sanity for example for the CEO for an organization like Tesla for an organization like Ford?
421080	426280	There's a whole bunch of constraints that sort of immediately tie you
426960	430560	To a vision of the same, you know Tesla is not gonna go out
431360	432960	and
432960	435440	Invade the island of Haiti and like, you know
436040	440960	Re-enslave the Haitians and set them to making sugarcane. It's just not that is not going to happen
440960	446080	That is not within the realm of like saying things that Tesla could do Tesla is not going to say
446680	449240	Tomorrow we're gonna take over the dental floss business
449240	453880	We're gonna become the kings of dental floss like they're not gonna do this and and so
454560	457440	when you're in sort of like a
460080	469440	System and a structure that defines what sanity is whether you're Elon Musk or Elizabeth the first or Louis the 14th
471440	475000	You have like it's sort of
476120	482720	It feels like this much less sort of open-ended kind of crazy problem of like
482720	490360	Oh, we're gonna go crazy and invade the moon or like, you know, and and there's there's like there's a lot of things that
491560	496240	Washington does every day that are as crazy as invading the moon and when you look at the way
496760	498760	Those crazy things happen
498760	506040	It's not because of one or two crazy people actually generally the people involved in these things are like very
506080	508080	sensible and very good and very
509920	511920	You know
511960	514200	Yeah, practical down-to-earth people
515120	521240	Team players, you know, they're just basically in a system that makes them make, you know, crazy decisions
521240	527480	I mean for me the COVID thing because I'm a you know, believer in the in the lab leak theory of COVID is
527720	530400	such a perfect sort of case of like
531040	537320	We're gonna have these crazy incentives that basically leave us doing this extremely dangerous
537320	541360	gain-of-function research in this very very risky and unsafe way and
542440	544440	the
545560	550640	Because there's the government has taken on too much problems like with the company like Tesla
550640	557920	They have a very specific mandate and with the government. It's so open-ended. Is that where the craziness or the stochastic chaos is coming?
557920	561520	That's giving rise to these crazy ideas and behaviors. The the
563800	565800	Like
568560	570560	I mean, you know
570560	577640	Even the question of what the mission of government is which seemed very obvious and very straight-forward
578160	581320	Sadie the Elizabethans has taken on all this sort of
582040	585120	Chili-astic and messianic kind of you know overtones
585720	588840	I mean even when you look at for example
589600	591600	when you dive into
591960	596240	Say a question like foreign policy, it's sort of dubious as to whether
597000	603120	There's sort of ever been any clear sanity guiding us foreign policy
603120	607880	I mean if you go and look for example at Washington's farewell address
609040	611040	Which you predict, you know the farewell address
611800	613800	I
618080	620400	Could but I'll just I'll just summarize it
620400	628280	You know his farewell address is sort of he's like reminding Americans that their foreign policy should be conducted in the you know
628280	631520	The interests of America and it's that he's expressing
631680	637800	it's it's one of the expressions of kind of what is sometimes called isolationist foreign policy and
638600	640600	he's basically
640640	647880	Sort of painting this picture very 18th century picture of a kind of wise approach to foreign policy and
648960	653000	You know, this is all very well, but you sort of read it and you're like
654560	660840	Why do you have to say this and the reason he had to say this and warned against basically
661720	663360	sort of
663360	664320	being
664320	666560	pulled into the quarrels of others and
666800	668800	Is that already?
668960	675160	Basically many Americans including the Americans who didn't really disagree didn't really agree with George Washington too much
675360	684040	We're very very eager to basically see the United States become the kind of world home base of revolutionary politics
684040	690680	And so right away you had this, you know, we've always been dreamers then or at least there
690680	700120	You had this incredibly wacky event with this guy's citizen Jenae who was the the French Revolutionary Ambassador to the US and basically
701320	708640	Made him made such a news made himself such a nuisance that he actually got kicked out was but was basically sort of proceeding on this plan and
709080	712280	The level of like support for the French Revolution
713320	715320	Even as sort of at its most
715320	717040	Sanguinary days
717080	721760	Was you know, you'll have all these lines from Jefferson where he's like the tree of you know
721760	726080	The tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of tyrants or like shit like that
726080	733280	You know where he's basically like, you know, he's like, ah, you know, he reacts to this insane shit in France where he's been
733280	738320	right by you got to kill a few people everyone's alright, you know, it's kind of creepy, right, you know and and
739000	741000	distinctly
741000	743000	reminiscent of
743000	747560	American sympathy for Stalin or for, you know, the Russian Revolution
748400	751120	I mean in 1848 there's this
751640	759160	Of course outright, you know sort of outbreak of almost what we would now call color revolutions across Europe and
761120	766320	This one character in Hungary this guy to soothe becomes the liberal leader of Hungary
766960	772840	Is then chased out by, you know, the Russian Russian troops help the Habsburgs reinstall themselves
773360	781440	Kuthu Kuthuth gets chased out and he becomes this massive public celebrity first in London and then in America
781800	790600	Where basically people are doing exactly the same thing with sort of the Hungarians in 1848 that they're doing say with the Ukrainians now
790600	796880	They're basically found, you know, they're sort of doing exactly what Washington was telling them not to do
796880	803800	They basically found the sort of foreign quarrel developed an emotionally interested and picked a side and
804720	806160	like, you know
806160	807520	gone
807520	811760	bananas over it. Do you think that has something to do with our culture then that we like to
812080	816320	Kind of embosom the world or we find a conflict that doesn't necessarily have to do with us
816360	818360	We just identify with that
821320	823320	Yeah, it's like a sick
823400	829960	Laticatorial, you know reflex. It's like if you remember the Arab Spring, right? You were probably excited about the Arab Spring
830200	835800	That was the bipartisan, you know, excitement. Everyone was excited about the Arab Spring and that's cool
835800	841600	The internet was doing it making waves, you know, Twitter. Yeah, I know I know I know I know and and this is like yeah
841600	844840	Twitter and Facebook were and you remember like Google guy in Egypt, right?
844840	849560	You know and that movement wind up killing about 500,000 to a million people
849560	854760	It did not cause the Civil War in Egypt, which it almost did which certainly would have killed a few more million people
855400	857880	It devastated Syria and Libya
858800	864920	And it was like it was sort of funny watching, you know, sort of the American
866800	870320	Democratic governance machine in a situation where
871000	877800	Public opinion and the deep state are really sort of completely aligned and we feel that we're doing this very clearly
878480	880400	unambiguously good thing
880400	883080	and then it just results in just like
883520	885880	horror and disaster as usual and
886800	888800	the
889040	891040	The response of people
892400	898000	There's sort of one test I use for like sanity in that situation
898400	906560	Which is kind of a good Samaritan test and if you're really acting as a as a good Samaritan in this case, let's say you
908080	911720	You're walking down the street and you see your horrific motorcycle accident
911720	919400	And you're the first one on this scene you run over to the guy. He's lying there in his motorcycle helmet. You like take his helmet off
921240	923240	Don't do that you made a mistake
923240	929200	Do not move the helmet of someone who's had a motorcycle accident because it turns out that you just broke his neck
929200	935040	And or he broke his neck, but you broke his spinal cord and paralyzed him for life. Let the MTS handle that one
935040	937360	Right, but you didn't right? You were trying to be nice
937360	940160	You were trying to help but you basically just inflicted this
940800	943680	Horridous life-changing thing on these people, right?
943680	950760	And so if you're basically doing that with the sort of the true spirit of charity and altruism
951360	956520	You're gonna be pretty beaten up about that. You're gonna think hard about wow
956520	962520	I was trying to help but instead I inflicted this crazy level of damage and
964200	966560	You would definitely never do something like that again and
968400	975360	But we don't as a country we work but with Arab Spring it was like, oh, this didn't work out. It's too bad
975360	979760	Let's change the channel, right? You know and so there's this sense of like
980360	982360	sort of
983600	992680	Deranged and irresponsible like power in a sense running free, you know, it's like when you compare say Libya
993960	996960	or the Libyan revolutionaries in
997920	999920	2012 or whenever it was to
1000760	1009000	sort of foreign policy of the past the thing that it instantly reminds you of is say the Spanish-American war or
1009760	1013720	Say the reunification of Italy by Garibaldi
1014640	1018920	Garibaldi certainly reunified Italy with his like 300 red shirts or whatever
1018920	1020080	but
1020080	1024120	That was a reconquer the kingdom of the two Sicilies with this 300 red shirts
1024120	1029560	Which was possible only because he had the British Navy right offshore declaring basically a no-sale zone
1030880	1034880	Whatever the equivalent was at the time, right? So it was this sort of act of
1036040	1038040	kind of somewhat naked
1038760	1046280	Imperialism and the result was a new unified Italy which was to some extent a British client state
1046440	1052760	Which offered a lot of new commercial opportunities to British merchants. You look at the Spanish-American war
1052800	1060720	It has all of these like, you know all this liberal rhetoric about how you know in the yellow press about how you know
1060720	1065920	The evil Spanish generals are abusing, you know fetching Cupid maidens and so forth
1065920	1074280	They really laid it on extremely thick and and like just like at a level of like blatancy. That's just utterly comical today
1075800	1077800	But on the other hand
1078480	1084960	So it was sort of this kind of high point of like liberal imperialism or like an attack on a foreign power
1084960	1089840	That was basically justified by sort of liberal thinking on the other hand
1089840	1094880	This liberal thinking resulted in basically the acquisition of Cuba the Philippines and Puerto Rico
1095320	1103160	Say what you want about Puerto Rico, but these are valuable properties basically and we're treated as valuable properties and
1103640	1110400	Returned much to like American colonialist investors and the United Fruit Company and so on and so forth
1110400	1116240	And so you basically look at that sort of liberal imperialism and you're like, okay
1117040	1119680	There's something predatory here clearly
1119960	1127840	You know from the perspective of Spain there's something very predatory going on here on the other hand like
1128880	1130200	What?
1130200	1134280	the US in 1898 killed it ate and
1135280	1140240	So it was like a dog like there's something ugly about it and there's something beautiful about it
1140240	1144800	It's like a wolf hunting a deer, you know, like, you know, this is only gonna end one way
1144800	1148480	You know, the wolf was gonna take down the deer and then the wolf was gonna eat, right?
1148480	1153040	And the thing is when you look at sort of the liberal imperialism of today
1153880	1155400	It's like
1155400	1157400	It's like a dog killing sheep
1157440	1163320	Like there's an instinct to like take out Gaddafi. There's an instinct to take out Assad
1163320	1168520	It feels great to have wheeled Obama and put it something on his teleprompter where he's like Assad must go
1168520	1170520	Boba bark must go Gaddafi must go
1171520	1180000	People understate the sort of power of American self-power to the point where if you will to bomb it out and had him say like
1180000	1183080	Merkel must go you could probably start a civil war in Germany that way
1189000	1196280	Just by just by basically saying we remove the moral authority from this regime that we have established and
1196880	1202400	If you basically yeah, I mean you could you know amazing things are possible with that shit
1204040	1206040	But
1206680	1213880	This liberal retric or this this liberal facade of generosity of caring is always hiding some sort of power play
1213880	1220920	Or you can't separate those two would it be better to just like it's like can't it can't it's an interesting question
1221080	1223080	It's like it's hiding
1223200	1227680	It's not really an absence of
1228840	1236040	Sincerity it's that it's sort of it's a thing that the sincerity kind of doesn't know itself
1236040	1241880	And so people think that they're genuinely sincere that what they're sort of doing is
1244160	1250160	Caring but what's actually sort of driving them and driving the structures there is
1250640	1256840	Something where when the effects of the caring are extremely bad and counterproductive
1257280	1258880	There's no caring about that
1258880	1265520	So in a way, it's like it's something that really wants to think of itself as kind of a duty of care
1265920	1271160	but you can also read it as this like perverse gladiatorial fascination and
1272080	1274080	You know this thing of like
1274400	1279280	We're using Ukraine to weaken Putin and we're gonna like fight to the last Ukrainian
1279280	1282960	I mean, it's like if you think you're doing a good thing for Ukraine
1283520	1289120	Excuse me the Ukraine here. If you think you're doing a good thing for the Ukraine you're already
1290960	1292960	Several hundred yards
1293680	1295680	Behind the goal line here
1295840	1301520	Like many bad things have already happened to Ukraine the Ukraine as a result of this policy
1302080	1305760	Of arming it to like basically as an anti-russian power
1306320	1311520	So you might say we're gonna get the 300 yards back and we're gonna get back to our own 20
1311920	1318160	But you've got you're you're not even in the stadium right now in terms of the damage you've inflicted on this country
1318640	1320400	and
1320400	1325840	You would say well the Ukrainians are into it. Well, yeah, I mean like
1326800	1330560	The Jedi mind powers of like the american
1331600	1333600	cosmopolitan ruling class
1333840	1335840	Are extremely great
1335840	1337040	and
1337040	1339600	If we went past sort of our current
1340320	1342000	Enthusiasm's into like
1342000	1344880	Some kind of full-on jim jones suicide cult
1345760	1348240	I feel like a lot of the chic people in
1348880	1352400	Warsaw and Kiev and levove would be committing suicide as well
1353600	1358880	I think that's sort of how powerful that kind of fashion dominance is in a way and so
1359520	1361840	and that was certainly the case with the
1362560	1364000	kind of
1364000	1366640	tiny fringes of sort of liberal elite who
1367520	1375680	Were very into the arab spring. Also. It's like wow civil society in libya or civil civil society in egypt is going to get a huge boost
1376240	1380160	Um, and they didn't but you could see where they were sort of coming from
1380880	1382880	with that and so
1383040	1385040	that we just like with
1386080	1388080	I don't know. I don't want to get into european
1388480	1391680	History or something, but I'm just thinking we inflict that on ourselves through
1392320	1393760	Wokeness or dei training
1393760	1396640	It seems like with the black lives matter event like the liberal
1397360	1401440	Cosmopolitan elite was all on board with defunding the police. We're going to liberate these
1402240	1408160	These these areas of our own country and now those areas are completely decimated by yeah, all of them
1408160	1415200	Well, I mean, yeah, I mean it wasn't rhetoric doesn't actually translate into hoping it wasn't I mean it wasn't the first time
1415360	1417360	I mean if you look at
1417680	1419680	basically
1419920	1421520	60 years ago
1421520	1423520	Every major american city
1424000	1430560	Had like a thriving black business district. It had a thriving black upper class residential district
1432080	1435440	You know in those areas of general are burned out now and that was basically
1436160	1439200	something that happened in the late 60s and early 70s
1439920	1441040	and
1441040	1443040	You know the connection between
1443680	1445360	that and
1445360	1447360	the civil rights movement which
1448160	1453680	Americans saw on their TVs and supported with great enthusiasm seems to be sort of rather
1454800	1456800	Direct in a way
1457520	1459520	And so you're basically
1460640	1462080	again
1462080	1464800	Looking at something where if you're like
1465600	1466720	Wow
1466720	1471440	Let's say i'm like flying a drone over urban african-american areas
1472080	1479680	In like 1962 and 2022 what i'm going to observe with my eyes is that these areas have been like
1480320	1484480	decimated and so I would basically assume that
1485760	1490560	Sometime in the 60s some kind of radical anti-black party had come to power
1490960	1499040	Maybe the klu Klux Klan had won the election in 68 and that would explain why these areas had been systematically destroyed
1499520	1507040	Right and that's not indeed what happened. You know what happened was actually the opposite of that what happened was that
1507680	1509440	basically
1509440	1514560	A set an aspect of america that hadn't gotten a whole lot of attention or sympathy
1515280	1518320	Or this or you know empathy you might say
1519360	1523440	Receive that and the result of this emotion was
1524480	1526480	seemed to be and you know
1527040	1528960	just to
1529120	1532800	A physical observer of the people in the places
1533760	1536000	Seems to be a great deal of destruction
1536960	1537840	and
1537840	1539840	the mentality of
1540000	1545440	Like our intentions are good our hearts are pure and so we don't really have to think about
1546320	1550160	The destruction that we're causing or the destruction that results here
1551040	1553040	is not
1553040	1556240	The way that people whose hearts are pure think
1557200	1563040	And so at no point under any of these examples to the people who are taking off the bike helmet
1563280	1568480	Actually have to deal with the severed spine or recognize that they're at fault for doing that
1568560	1571680	It doesn't seem yes. That's capable or the system itself
1572320	1573520	There are the liberal
1573520	1579840	There's culture just can't see they're they're they're motivated by like there's something that
1580960	1582960	is very similar
1583520	1586080	to empathy and sort of easily
1586960	1594320	Masquerades as it but like drives out the real thing. It's like a kind of gresham's law where bad money drives out good
1594800	1596800	bad empathy drives out good empathy
1598080	1605360	And so, you know, one of the ways to think about well, you know, you're like, what is this bad empathy?
1605360	1607360	What is this thing that
1607440	1610080	is like empathy, but is not empathy and
1610080	1617520	It reminds me of this etymological fact that I love that I always quote, which is the etymology of the word lord
1619120	1622880	Lord is an old anglo-saxon word and it comes from
1623520	1625280	cloth ward
1625280	1627280	Which means the cloth is
1628720	1629920	loaf
1629920	1631600	as in bread
1631600	1639920	And the ward is ward is in guard as in basically so your lord is basically he who guards your bread
1640080	1643120	he who gives you this day your daily bread and
1644640	1647760	If you're feeding someone you basically are his lord
1648240	1651440	because even if you don't care to tell him what to do you could
1652160	1655680	And you could say if you don't do this, I'm not gonna feed you
1656240	1661760	and so the sort of, you know, basically the sense that you have of like
1662480	1667360	Caring for others is like closely entwined with the sense
1667920	1669920	of being lord over them
1670960	1671920	and
1671920	1678320	You know, certainly as a parent like you feel that very closely like the the sort of the care and the dependency
1678960	1681200	Are all very much tied together
1681920	1683120	and so
1683120	1686240	in a way when people adopt these sort of, you know
1687120	1692240	The mindset that supports these kinds of foreign policies, they sort of
1693040	1697440	Acquiring or domestic policies. They're sort of acquiring clients in a way
1697520	1700480	They're sort of feeling themselves become more powerful
1700960	1704640	Because they're feeling themselves owning others by caring for others
1705040	1706720	it's it's actually
1706720	1707760	it's
1707760	1713280	represented on twitter the people who put ukraine flags in their bio are kind of claiming ukraine as their own in a way
1713440	1718800	They're claiming ukraine as absolutely. They're claiming ukraine as their as their position and they don't really understand
1719360	1723440	Yeah, as their vassal state, right, you know, and they sort of don't understand like
1724160	1727040	because they've sort of only been exposed to
1728240	1730240	Imperialism as a caricature
1730960	1734880	They don't really understand how close this is to
1736080	1738880	The way that actual imperialists thought
1739760	1745600	And so yeah, white man's burden kind of classic. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah white man's burden, right? And so basically
1746240	1748240	you know, they're they're taking up the
1749200	1753280	You know, the the the white man's burden when they put the ukraine flag in their
1754320	1758320	In their thing, I mean, you know, of course raises the question of whether slobs are white
1758480	1760640	But um, you know, we don't we don't have to go into that
1761040	1764880	Add the mulligy of slave if you want to hey, there you go. There you go. Right, right, right, right?
1765200	1769120	And now it's like they wear these track suits. They have this like squat, you know the
1769920	1777040	I mean, you know, I don't know if you know that like some of the rhetoric, you know, the sort of ukrainian russian rhetoric is absolutely
1778000	1783040	Deranged and the word more deranged than our blue red rhetoric
1783680	1788080	Yes, because the slur that ukrainians have picked up on that they
1789680	1791680	Used for russian is orcs
1791680	1793840	Literally orcs. They stole it from tolkin, right?
1793840	1797520	And so they basically think of them as like subhuman creatures from the east
1798000	1803200	And and one of the things that triggered the original revolt in the donbas in 2014
1803680	1809040	Was basically as soon as the kind of western ukrainians got control of the ukrainian state
1809360	1812400	They started passing all of these like anti russian laws
1812480	1817280	Like you have to like not speak russian and like change your name to like the funny looking ukrainian spelling
1817680	1821520	And you'll see pictures on yes, so they did a cultural genocide
1822480	1824480	Yeah, that's a strong genocide
1825200	1832400	It's basically yeah, it's the sort of thing that basically you do to a cultural, you know minority that you basically want to kind of
1833200	1837040	You know bring into line, you know, you could compare it if you were feeling generous to like the way
1837520	1845680	That like northern france treated southern france like 500 600 years ago, right, you know, and and and it's like the
1848240	1854080	And and so you'll see pictures one of the old folk punishments or whatever which gets used a lot
1855200	1857760	In ukraine is tying people to trees
1858080	1862800	And so I don't know if you go around you'll see in twitter people tied to trees or telephone poles
1862800	1867360	And sometimes their faces have been painted green to show that there are orcs
1868000	1870480	Um, this would be like I don't think that like
1871120	1876080	Speaking russian is not going to do that but like basically you're being accused of being a russian sympathizer
1876480	1883200	So it's just this like, you know, you go into like the inside of this war and there's just like insane shit everywhere, right?
1883280	1889920	You know and and needless to say the people with ukrainian flags in their in their twitter handles
1890400	1894640	Would probably never tie anyone to a tree and paint their face green for speaking the wrong language
1895040	1899360	But like that that was probably not really in their like bag of tricks
1899680	1903200	Like at all really but like that's sort of what they're
1904080	1910240	When they basically sort of picked sides in this like nationalistic Balkan basically fight
1910240	1914320	I'm sure all all ukrainians would be insulted by my use of the word Balkan
1914320	1918880	But you know the the like, you know, you're just doing this like
1919520	1921520	There's this level at what
1922560	1924960	Where what you're doing is this kind of
1926080	1932400	Gladiatorial spectator thing and like to like sort of step sort of all the way
1933280	1935280	back, right
1935680	1937680	It's like when
1938640	1946720	You know, you look at the foreign policy that's driven this where you know, there were these constant promises made to like not expand NATO
1946720	1952080	And then it's like, oops. Sorry. It looks like we're expanding NATO, right, you know and the
1953440	1956320	like the sense of
1958640	1963040	A driving force behind this kind of foreign policy
1963200	1967440	Which is not in any way the force of reason
1968720	1974160	Is like you're just like it's sort of it's just like power is flowing
1974960	1978320	Into wherever it wants to go and it's sort of reminiscent
1978720	1983760	There's a lot of this kind of foreign policy that's like very reminiscent of the frog in the scorpion, right?
1984000	1986960	where basically it's just sort of
1987920	1992880	The nature of this whole system, which includes both the
1993680	1997920	bureaucrats who run it and the sort of supporters of it who basically like
1998640	2003760	Have these incentives to basically cause trouble and create problems
2004240	2008880	And they don't see it that way. That is not their framework. They're basically
2009920	2016480	Trying to like create freedom, but their sense of freedom is basically they see one stone on top of another
2017120	2019680	And they're like we must liberate the stone on the bottom
2020080	2023600	And so, you know, sort of freedom is kind of becomes
2024880	2026640	indistinguishable from
2026640	2028960	a kind of like destruction and so
2029920	2033680	You look at basically the like things that
2034400	2036000	like
2036000	2039600	When you compare for example, afghanistan to vietnam
2040480	2042480	you know, basically
2043200	2044400	The
2044400	2048000	first of all afghanistan is run by people who's like
2048960	2052560	Formative experience was the lessons learned from vietnam
2053440	2058720	And just in terms of like age cohort. They didn't seem to learn any lesson at all and like
2059680	2061600	vietnam
2061600	2064320	afghanistan makes vietnam looks sane and
2065920	2071680	Like it made vietnam looks sane. It was just like all of us. We're never gonna get the you know full metal jacket movies
2071760	2076240	It's never gonna be romanticized or yeah. Yeah, and and there's no like, you know
2076400	2079040	It's like when you look at sort of for example
2079200	2084400	Like the reality of the south vietnamese government is like much realer than the afghan government
2084880	2086880	Like the level of like, you know
2087840	2089840	Sort of just like everything about
2090640	2097280	Vietnam you can sort of find ways to look at the vietnam effort where you're like, okay, there's certain ways
2098080	2100800	Ultimately in the end this didn't make sense and it didn't work
2100880	2102800	But you can kind of see
2102800	2107200	Here are things that made sense that like this was maybe like close to
2107680	2113920	And you can't even find out for afghanistan and so you have just like all of these things whether it's like
2115040	2117040	invading afghanistan and
2117120	2122560	Trying to like, you know for 20 years. We're there for spending 20 years in this comical
2123200	2126480	ridiculous ineffective attempt to turn it into vermont or something
2127920	2130320	And maybe we would have been happy with florida
2130880	2134240	Maybe we could have been happy. Maybe we could have been happy with oklahoma
2134480	2139600	Maybe we could have been happy with guam, but no, you know, we needed we needed the vermont concept of you know
2139680	2144160	The bennington concept of human rights, you know, and and and like and so, you know
2144160	2147280	We had all these bennington grads going and teaching like, you know, very, you know
2147760	2149760	In gender rights, whatever
2150640	2156240	Poetry workshops, right, you know, exactly and and um nothing wrong with a good poetry workshop
2156320	2163360	But you know like everything has its place and and the I mean they love they love I mean in the taliban actually writing
2164080	2170560	Poems is like a qualification for leadership, right? But is it is it? It is it is it is a very good volume
2170560	2176800	There's a yes, there's a volume of like translated taliban poetry. That's actually not too bad if you're into it's all of course
2177040	2179600	From a taliban perspective, right? You know, it's not really
2180160	2182160	Not really gonna appeal to the
2183120	2187840	It's like there's this there's this other great book that i'm a huge fan of um called zen at war
2188240	2194400	Which was written by like a california hippie zen dude like in the 80s or 90s or something where he realizes that
2194960	2200400	All of these zen masters many of whom came over to like california because they smelled a good thing and like
2200960	2206960	After you know the 40s 50s 60s, but in like the 30s and 40s these guys are in japan
2207760	2211520	They're in imperial japan, right? So he's like what is zen like?
2212240	2213280	um
2213280	2220960	In imperial japan and he basically finds all these like and he just quotes these things with it's just the outrage where they're just like, you know
2221840	2229280	The feeling of zen is the feeling of a chinese soldier's head trapping from his body as the perfect swords
2229440	2231440	like i mean, right, you know
2232320	2237040	And like, you know, there's just you know, nothing is more zen than the mom that are killing right, you know or
2238000	2239440	and
2239440	2244320	It just reminds you of the sort of protean nature of this religion which can be sort of like
2244880	2251280	california hippies and and you know imperial desk wads, uh, you know equally well and and and
2253600	2257680	I'm sure these zen and tally bone the tally bone. Yeah, right. And so yeah, there's definitely
2257760	2262400	I mean there's something poetic and beautiful about martyrdom operations or whatever you want to call it
2262800	2265120	Well, or you have to have a poetic sense of
2265600	2267200	Reality in order to sure
2267200	2272080	I mean, and you know, you listen you listen to isis videos. They're all like, you know, nashid's
2272560	2278880	Which are um, you know acapella singing that, you know, uh, salafi islam's like, okay, you can have music
2278960	2283280	But no instruments. Yeah, so you have these basically nashid's which are like
2283760	2287040	Sort of the taliban al qaeda equivalent of like the narco corrido
2287120	2292240	If you know that mexican genre like the drug drug narco music from northern mexico
2292720	2297280	Like that celebrates like, you know, the the achievements of great drug lords
2297760	2302640	Um, and they have that for basically martyrs and so forth. And I mean, it's it's beautiful
2302960	2306800	Anyway, there's this very good volume with have translated taliban poetry, but um,
2307520	2311920	Yeah, you know, definitely like feminist poetry workshops are not really the thing
2312000	2314880	It's gonna turn kandahar into into bennington
2315440	2318640	And and so you basically, you know, they had their chance, right?
2318720	2322560	You know, if it was gonna work, it was gonna work. It probably would have worked by now
2325280	2328960	And and so when we basically, um
2330400	2334240	Kind of pull the camera back and we look at basically
2334880	2337920	Just like the level of just weird
2338640	2340480	insane shit
2340480	2346320	That dc does that nobody even thinks about like how weird and insane it is
2346880	2354000	You're at a like, you know, people will be like, well, the u.s. government's lorotic and, you know, slow and bumbling and bureaucratic
2354080	2359120	But so is ibm. I'm like, yeah, okay. Yes. ibm is like this, but like
2359840	2365760	Waters of magnitude my friends, like, you know, like and and so they're just like whole
2366880	2373040	You know, it's like another great dc example is you remember 9 11 probably
2373760	2379120	Looks like you were a little younger than me at that time. But um, they came up they came up with this
2381920	2384960	You're you're looking good. Um, the um, um
2385760	2388160	The the keeping that brown hair is very important
2389360	2394640	He got great locks too. Yeah. Yeah, as soon as as soon as I start getting bald. That's all coming off
2395680	2400240	But um, I will not be one of those people but you know, the um, it's good a good hat
2401200	2405440	Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, right. Um, but just like the
2406880	2409040	the sheer
2409040	2411040	like
2411440	2416560	The will like the the sheer like the yeah, I mean the example I was thinking of is that
2417360	2421040	So we have this term national security that was basically
2421840	2426560	It's a world war two term and what was decided, you know, basically
2426720	2429920	I think there's this line from roosevelt where he's basically like
2431280	2438320	Any political events anywhere in the world are relevant to us national security. This is basically this isn't the second
2438400	2440640	Yeah, this is this is franklin, right? And so
2441200	2444800	basically it somehow came about that basically
2446160	2448960	part of the american kind of political
2450080	2454320	Creed became that to keep america safe. We have to rule the world
2454560	2459520	But you say even washington even george washington had already noticed that that is our tendency
2459600	2464320	There's something and exactly the way we look at the world is that there's something there's this sort of weird
2464880	2467920	Yeah, there's this weird vicarious like hunger
2468560	2470560	That basically becomes
2471280	2474000	People really don't feel it as the will to dominate it
2474000	2477680	But it becomes the will to dominate and then it's sort of that will to dominate
2478400	2483520	Enter as all of these institutions and become sort of part of the unconscious
2484320	2486320	Creed of these institutions
2486960	2489760	And then the us is actually attacked in
2490880	2492000	2001
2492000	2493200	And so
2493200	2497120	Then they have to come up with this term homeland security
2498480	2504720	Which means national security but not national security because that word is already taken, right?
2505680	2510960	And so they come up with this weird nazi sounding term homeland, right? You know homeland, right?
2510960	2512640	At least it's genderless, right?
2512640	2514160	At least it's genderless, right?
2514160	2515440	You know haimath, right?
2515440	2523760	You know and and it's just like it's it's and and you're like you would say national security except that word is already taken
2524160	2530000	For meaning something which it doesn't mean, right? And so you have all these incredible like
2531040	2533040	distortions of like
2533280	2537040	There are all these convoluted ways of thinking that are sort of
2537920	2539920	spread to the population
2540320	2541360	from
2541360	2547760	You know these assumptions that are hidden deep in our these assumptions that are sort of came out of some weird
2548400	2553120	Historical structure that get embedded in everything. You know, it's sort of like the
2555120	2556960	You know the
2556960	2562720	I think people have traced like the six foot social disc both the six foot social distancing thing
2563280	2567360	And the paper straw thing and people have been like where did this come from?
2567760	2570480	And they actually found like high school science projects
2571040	2573360	That were basically the source of this shit, right?
2573600	2576000	You know and and like it doesn't matter anymore
2576000	2580640	But you still have all you know all these circles on the floor where there's six feet social distancing thing
2581040	2588400	Which is absolutely and utterly and profoundly unscientific as like, you know, I mean it took these these just
2589360	2592560	In like the specific area of the
2593440	2594320	WHO
2594320	2598480	Had this bias for bizarre historical scientific reasons
2599040	2602400	Against thinking of viruses as airborne, right?
2602400	2608640	And so you basically had this where the six feet comes from was this whole like droplet theory
2609120	2614000	Which was shown to be completely incorrect like which never made any godium sense
2614560	2618720	And was shown to be completely incorrect very early in the pandemic
2619200	2620160	And it took
2620160	2624640	WHO like a year and a half to be like well, I guess maybe it might be airborne, right?
2624720	2632160	Meanwhile in japan, they're like, okay, you know, like better ventilation is like the solution here because it's obviously airborne
2632560	2639520	Right and they had some sort of native bureaucracy there which could kind of make up its own mind
2640240	2644400	But the mindset's the point is that basically when you're looking at the way
2645440	2647440	this system does government
2648240	2650240	it has
2650400	2652400	embedded in it a lot of
2653280	2659840	Extremely bizarre assumptions. Okay. It's like it's like it's like English language where you have these weird words that are just floating around
2659840	2664320	That mean nothing like what they what they came from or yeah, or just something strange
2664640	2671680	conjugations like the oxen, you know, and you're just like you can go in the past and you can say oh well
2671760	2673040	this came from
2673040	2679520	The dynamics of world war two or like this came from like somebody's high school project about plastic straws, you know
2680080	2681200	and
2681200	2683200	watch like how
2684560	2691920	I mean, I guess my sort of point going back to your original question about monarchy is that
2692560	2697520	Sort of people are always like they sort of believe in the wisdom or not even the wisdom
2697520	2700080	But like the sanity of crowds and they're like
2700640	2705920	One person could be completely mental and start poisoning the burritos or doing them, you know
2706480	2707680	um
2707680	2713600	And then but if you have like a community of the smartest best people making the decision
2714240	2717120	Like how could that go wrong? Like who?
2718000	2722000	Why should like some king who however he was chosen?
2722080	2726800	Maybe he was just born to be king like and he's making the decisions about virology
2726800	2730960	Shouldn't the virologist make the decisions about virology and like, you know
2731280	2736400	The idea that the virologist should make the decisions about virology seems extremely logical
2736960	2740000	and sensible a confederacy of experts is what we
2740320	2745840	Yeah, I want and it eventually gets you to covet 19 because it basically
2746560	2748560	Creates incentives
2748880	2752080	in within that network of experts where
2752720	2756240	They basically are in a position position to say well
2756960	2758960	We need funding to do our work
2759200	2762160	Um, the more important we are the more funding we get
2762880	2767920	Therefore it is important for us to find important emerging threats which could be threatening
2768480	2773760	So let's basically go and collect all the bat viruses while these bat viruses can't you know
2774160	2779360	Normally infect people because they're bat viruses, but what if they mutated to jump to humans?
2779520	2781520	That would be very dangerous and scary
2781760	2785360	Um, let's examine how they could mutate to jump to humans
2786000	2788880	Uh, well, how could we do that? We could just create some
2789920	2796960	Examples create some examples, right? You know and and basically you're just like not, you know, um
2797920	2803120	Realizing in the process of this process of this that you're doing exactly what the like
2803760	2808000	Dr. Chernobyl did when he's like we got to figure out if this nuclear reactor is safe
2808640	2813280	Our theory is that if we turn off all the safety systems and run full power
2813920	2822080	We'll still be safe, right? You know and and and like that's basically what you're doing when you collect these guiding bat viruses, right? And and like
2822880	2824880	so
2825600	2830160	Scientists aren't adapted to power power adapts scientists to itself
2830320	2835040	So so scientists are focused on on on making science or even even trying to
2835760	2837760	Solve a problem with regards to health
2838000	2842080	But power itself exerts a shape onto how the science
2842480	2846880	Happens and what what decisions each end up coming out of and it mutates
2847440	2852240	And it mutates the culture of science eventually and so basically
2853040	2854640	to become
2854640	2861040	We think of scientists as these people driven by pure curiosity puttering around in their labs
2861520	2867280	Like some, you know, 19th century like, you know, vicar or something that or alchemist studies
2867920	2870880	studies beetles under a microscope, you know, and
2871920	2877360	That person is driven entirely by their curiosity and wonder and lefren
2877680	2880480	And these are the things that cause people to get into science
2880960	2886480	But the thing is is once you're in science you discover that it's just actually like
2887440	2892400	Very very cut through a bureaucracy and you have to basically be
2893360	2896000	A good operator in that bureaucracy and the people
2896560	2904640	Who turn out to be the best at that are often somewhat mediocre scientists and really world-class bureaucrats
2905360	2910800	And so you basically sort of everything kind of gets twisted in this direction
2911520	2913520	Of like
2914880	2917840	Yeah, I need to justify my importance and the thing is
2918640	2920800	Most fields are not such that
2922960	2926800	You can actually create the problems that you're there to solve but like
2928240	2932560	A virus that goes around the world and kills. Yeah, virology is kind of an exception to that
2932640	2939600	And so basically these people were, you know, it's like the the classic dc example is the self-licking ice cream cone
2939600	2942480	Right, but this was like a toxic self-licking ice cream cone
2942720	2944880	It's like a self-licking ice cream cone is like
2945360	2949280	A something whose solution only exists to like solve itself like, you know
2949760	2952240	Like you don't even get the lick the ice cream that licks itself, right, you know
2952320	2957040	But but in this case it was a toxic self-licking ice cream cone and you look at basically
2957840	2959840	The bureaucratic incentives
2960720	2962720	Which caused that
2962880	2968640	To happen or I think caused that to happen because why would there be such a cover-up when there was nothing to cover up?
2969120	2970640	right and
2970640	2971520	the
2971520	2974240	Yeah, if reputation didn't matter nobody would have to lie
2975040	2977440	Yeah, right and and and there's clearly
2978000	2985280	Yes, there's clearly some bad dealing there and like obviously nobody involved in this research wants to admit that this is what happened
2985680	2987200	right and
2987200	2989200	And so in every instance
2989600	2991600	It's it's power that's directing everything
2991600	2996480	Whether it's it's under the guise of saving the world from this problem or liberating this country over here
2996480	3001120	There's always power eventually is always operating under the surface because that's eventually what
3001840	3009280	Happens is and power and power power corrupts things and so basically when you had I mean the way we got
3009920	3011920	to give sort of
3012320	3014320	academic models of policy
3015120	3020080	So much power in the 20th century is we started the 20th century in a world
3020560	3024240	Where power was largely actually held by corrupt politicians
3024720	3029360	And that like gilded age country worked a lot the like the way china works today in some ways
3029360	3030960	It wasn't a dictatorship
3030960	3037760	But it was a country in which everything was very very corrupt and was done very quickly in this ugly way power was directed
3038160	3043200	Specifically toward not necessarily the common good, but doing a work, right? It wasn't directed
3043520	3047600	It was something more solid perhaps it had a kind of corruption
3047920	3051280	I mean the kind of corruption that existed there
3051920	3054400	Or exists in china today was like
3055200	3059520	If the street gets built it may be cost 30 percent more than it should have cost
3060000	3064080	But it does get built um and but like the level of um
3065040	3067040	you know
3067040	3072880	There was also like there was yeah, and and so what happened early in the 20th century
3072960	3078560	was sort of the beginnings of what we call the progressive movement at that time was that basically
3079280	3082240	america's hereditary aristocracy
3083280	3085280	looked at this stuff and
3085520	3087280	basically saw
3087280	3089280	that people who
3089760	3090960	were
3090960	3094400	Dumber and less sophisticated than them were in charge
3095040	3099120	And like this is where we get, you know, one of the things I love to cite is this
3099760	3101200	bizarre
3101280	3103280	Sort of disconnect between
3103920	3106640	You know, we have if you think about the two words
3107440	3109440	democracy and politics
3109520	3115760	You'll notice that democracy has very very positive connotations and politics has very very negative connotations
3116240	3118240	but they're actually synonyms
3118880	3125040	And like how do you have politics without democracy or democracy without and specifically I've heard you say this but
3125520	3131040	What helped me understand it better was when you talk about populism is basically yeah, right or between democracy
3131200	3136800	politics is populism which populism is kind of a synonym for like putting politicians in charge
3137360	3140080	and putting politicians in you know who
3140720	3143920	Appeal to like what the public wants in charge
3144640	3147760	Is literally the meaning of representative democracy?
3148240	3150720	and so one of the things that basically
3151760	3157840	The progressive movement did is it said we're going to treat representative democracy sort of the way
3158160	3165520	The modern uk treats its monarchy. We're going to still have these elections, but we're going to make sure
3166240	3171840	That basically it's really traditional and important and constitutional and necessary
3172400	3176560	For the president to not really be in charge of the executive branch
3177120	3183520	Because if the president is like can tell doj who to prosecute like yeah, my god, right?
3183600	3188960	You know and so it's like saying queen elizabeth the second could say off with her head, right?
3189040	3194080	You know elizabeth the first could be like off of his head, but like elizabeth the second like
3194720	3197120	In theory she has the same job, right?
3198160	3200480	But in practice it's very very different and so
3201200	3205760	So the aristocracy re-exerted itself or the which would be the oligarchy
3206640	3211120	Or yeah, right right and sort of created this kind of institutional oligarchy
3211920	3214560	You know the word meritocracy has been used
3216240	3219520	Is that is that a cynical take meritocracy? That's a whole other discussion
3219520	3223280	It was originally in the in the original book by michael young
3223760	3226000	It was sort of meant as a cynical take
3226400	3228880	Okay, um, you know merit is a tough
3229520	3232640	Prove yourself to this particular
3233440	3233840	organization
3233840	3239120	But like prove your intelligence or prove that you have a degree from the right school or prove
3239120	3243120	Or you can jump through the de i hoops and do your equity statement in the right way
3243520	3250480	Yeah, right, right, right. It's it's it's sort of drifted, you know drifted away from merit or from any
3251680	3259440	Um ability to do something in the world that's productive other than yeah be a bureaucrat basically right right right right, um
3260560	3262880	Yeah, so so like the um
3262880	3264880	Um
3265200	3271920	Yeah, so so you have this in and you have this situation in which whenever you basically take something that hasn't been
3272560	3276080	You know power corrupts and when you take something that hasn't been
3276800	3280400	Corrupted by power such as america's beautiful universities
3280880	3285440	100 years ago and you say well, why not give these smart and reasonable people power
3286080	3288480	Surely they won't be corrupted by it in any way
3289840	3291840	and like basically
3292560	3294400	by giving
3294400	3299120	Sort of all these sciences of government real power over government
3299680	3301680	You've basically wound up, you know
3302400	3309200	Like you needed a valve in that so that the sewage didn't flow up into the drinking water and the sewage has definitely gotten into the drinking water
3309200	3315040	Yeah, um and and so like even virology it turns out can be corrupted by power
3315440	3318800	Because nobody got into virology because they wanted to cause a pandemic
3319200	3323920	Like, you know, this was not done by like evil scientists like, you know
3324800	3326080	um
3326080	3329680	Like this was done by people who were doing
3330480	3332480	What cune called normal science?
3332720	3335120	They were basically being like, oh, yeah
3335520	3339440	And like covet has only increased the funding that's going in this direction now
3339440	3342480	They're like see emerging viruses can cause huge problems
3342800	3347440	We really need to make sure we catch all the pokemon and so we're going to wow and go
3347520	3353040	We're going to go into the bat caves and get more bad viruses and play with them more and like
3353520	3359920	It's a sort of there's a counter example to that is the tsa being erected in the wake of 9 11
3360000	3362000	Like I don't know if that's increased
3362160	3366480	terrorism itself, but it it the government tapped into this way of uh, you know
3367280	3369280	Just swallowed this huge
3369280	3374160	Industry of checking people going through airports, right and now it's just an institution, right?
3374160	3378560	It doesn't necessarily cause more terrorism, but it's now it's just a waste of time and resources
3378560	3385280	Yeah, no no no and you're seeing some of that with the the covid control that will will will keep up forever basically
3385920	3387280	um
3387280	3388080	the
3388080	3393120	Yeah, I mean that's that's like that's sort of the self-licking ice cream cone sort of in its
3393360	3398320	Harmless sense where you have this thing and you know, um, take your shoes off
3398800	3403040	Take your shoes off because yeah, right, right, right, right and and like the
3403680	3406000	um, you know, I don't think that
3406480	3410880	Taking your shoes off and dumping your water is responsible for the like the death of terrorism
3411840	3416480	Or the death so far never never counted out, right? But um, no, I think that
3417360	3424720	You know going going around killing people has done a lot of that. Um, but you know, so it's like you can I mean
3427120	3431920	There's always a sort of defense for like you can sort of be like, yeah, let's you know
3433120	3440240	Defend the theory that the u.s. Needs to be the world's policeman because otherwise, you know, somebody else would or like they're always like
3440880	3444000	You know, nothing's quite black and white
3444240	3448800	but the essential point that I sort of want to make is that
3449600	3453680	If you're talking about a complete reset of like the meaning
3454560	3456320	and purpose
3456320	3458000	of government
3458000	3459680	you're talking about
3459680	3461680	something where like
3462480	3466400	You have a lot of answers to a lot of questions that basically
3467440	3474560	Date to are like really old and just happening by inertia or camera is something weird like the high school science fair
3475120	3478960	or like, you know, and the need for kind of
3480160	3484560	Reconsidering all of these questions in like a reasonable way
3485440	3486720	is like
3486720	3488240	the
3488240	3490240	fundamental driving
3490240	3491440	force
3491440	3496960	For imagining a completely different regime. Yeah, and it's sort of hard to know
3497760	3503600	There's sort of no obvious collective at all in the world that could make these kinds of
3504480	3506480	Decisions or choices
3506560	3508000	Collectively
3508000	3511920	So I I'm bringing this up because I'm pretty sure you're gonna shoot it down
3512000	3514640	But with the advent of the internet, uh, substack
3514640	3520320	Let's say that the brief phenomenon of what was called the intellectual dark web just as a concept just as a concept
3520640	3524720	There could be the case that the prestige makers or the king makers which
3525040	3532000	Resided in the new york times and in harvard could switch online to these independent content creators that build up reputations and then
3532480	3533920	bestow
3533920	3535920	prestige on
3535920	3538320	various different policies or various different
3538720	3540720	politicians, right if we
3540720	3546560	Because if you look at like the new york times of the washington post or harvard, they're spewing out all this bullshit
3546560	3549440	You know all this we call it wokeness, but there's just a lot of bullshit
3549440	3553920	It seems like they're they're expending their reputation. They're not making sense anymore more or less
3554160	3560800	So they're their prestigious going down will not the prestige somehow democratically through the marketplace of attention
3561760	3567600	Somehow replace that prestige mechanism that gives us the oligarchy that that shelves up the oligarchy
3568000	3572640	It's a good question. I think the problem is that sort of power is always prestigious
3573280	3575680	And the thing is you sort of you want
3576160	3581760	You really want this kind of level playing field on which sense outcompetes nonsense
3582400	3587600	And you basically look at this playing field and you're like, why does nonsense kind of regularly outcompete?
3588240	3592000	Sense and it's because the nonsense is powerful and the sense is not
3592560	3594560	And if you basically
3595120	3597760	If you even just take sort of isolationism
3598400	3600720	via versus internationalism
3601440	3605680	Um isolation versus globalism if you want to use two pejoratives there
3606240	3608240	um
3608240	3610400	What you see is that
3612000	3618240	There's much much more power in the active thing because the active thing basically is like
3618720	3621440	We must hire a lot of people to govern the world
3621520	3623920	We must think very hard about governing the world
3624320	3628240	Whereas isolationism is the reverse that isolationism is like
3628640	3634000	Hey, there's 50 000 of america's like smartest people in the state department. Do we need them? Why?
3634560	3635840	right and
3635840	3637840	And this sense of and so
3638480	3640480	Is it really that big it's 50 000 people
3640800	3645680	Something like that's a little smaller. I think it depends. I don't not that many fsos, but there's a lot of
3646480	3650560	Yeah, it's huge, right, you know, and I mean you're governing the world man, you know, like
3652960	3657760	The indirectly someone but you're governing the world so like the sense of
3658960	3660960	like what it
3662240	3664240	Takes to
3664480	3665360	like
3665360	3668240	There's sort of no situation under which
3669040	3670240	the
3670240	3671760	idea that
3671760	3677840	Is not a source of power is going to outcompete the idea that is a source of power naturally
3678240	3680240	Or it's like you're like, okay. Yeah
3680960	3682960	Harvard like
3683920	3688080	Like you might as an intellectual as a critic
3688880	3692960	Start to develop a community of people who have a low opinion of harvard
3693360	3701200	But how is that community of people going to develop the endowment the cultural capital the like regime capital?
3701840	3703840	like, you know to like
3704240	3709920	You're not really talking about a private institution when you you're talking about harvard and the new york times
3710000	3714240	You're talking about if these things were officially parts of the government
3714720	3719440	They'd be instantly recognizable as the most important and powerful parts of the government
3719920	3726720	Right and and so the question is while while the governor the trust in the government and the trust in harvard the trust in
3727040	3732320	The washington or the the new york times all these all these legacy institutions. They're they're spewing bullshit
3732400	3736880	They're spewing the stuff that doesn't make sense. They're but the trust doesn't come from their
3737440	3740240	Like ability to make sense their reputation
3740960	3743920	their reputation their prestige ultimately
3745200	3748160	Does not come from that reputation
3748240	3752320	There's a lot of things that they have to do to maintain that prestige
3752960	3757200	And there's certainly a lot of sort of prestige generating things
3757760	3762400	That happen there and they certainly do select a lot of very smart people
3763040	3765040	even though, you know
3765520	3767520	Admissions are what they are
3767840	3769840	but the like
3771280	3772560	The sort of
3772560	3776960	There's no way to offshore that to the internet. Yeah, there's there's no way there's no way
3777120	3780080	Yeah, there's no way for sort of this like 90s dream
3780720	3782400	of like people
3782400	3787600	Without any status or power competing with that because basically the
3789040	3790640	like
3790640	3799600	The ingredient the active ingredient is basically inertial the active ingredient union is that harvard is harvard and you're not
3800160	3805760	and like your ability to sort of crack into that business is like, I mean
3806480	3808800	You know, it's like there's a list of um
3809760	3813760	You know the top 14 law schools. I don't know why it's 14. It is 14
3814240	3816240	Why is it 500 fortune?
3816320	3821520	If you go, I don't know the length of the original at least it's at least it's the round number
3821840	3827040	The top 14 law schools have been the same top 14 law schools for the last 50 years
3827120	3833200	they're selected by something called us news and world report which used to be a magazine of some kind and
3834000	3839200	They haven't changed in the last 50 years and by the way, if you're going to law school and you're not getting a top 14 degree
3839760	3841760	useless don't do it and
3842400	3845600	You'll find yourself doing like discovery work or like shit work, right?
3845600	3850640	You know, only the top 14 law schools are real law schools, right? So, you know, basically
3851360	3854240	How do you break into that? Like
3854880	3860400	It's just no way just to think of it as basically part of the government and then you're just like when you ask the question
3861200	3863200	Of how does this change?
3864080	3866080	Or how is this shut down?
3866720	3868720	you will not expect
3868720	3876160	automatic automatic market mechanisms to do that for you because actually the market loves the stenershia
3876800	3877760	um
3877760	3884880	You can bet on it. Yeah, it's like, you know, it's it works, right? There's nothing that makes it not work
3885440	3893040	Um, even if it's creating bad laws or like, uh, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. It's like there's like a just world theory here
3893440	3896720	That's basically telling you that like when harvard starts
3897520	3904400	Teaching nonsense people will stop when we go to harvard and or people will stop listening to harvard or they will be like
3904480	3911280	No, it doesn't really work that way. Um, it's like when harvard ends. It's because basically
3912960	3918720	Somebody upstages it with another thing or it just collapses loses all this or or somebody infiltrates it
3919520	3922400	or the or or the police, um,
3922960	3924960	simply lock the doors and
3925440	3927440	Declare that, um
3927600	3932720	The campus has been seized of the trademark. It's been seized. I think it down has been seized
3933200	3939200	Right, you know, and and and so and and so the the thing is that basically and that's the that's the yeah, right
3939520	3943120	And and so the thing is that that when you basically
3943760	3945760	You know are sort of expecting
3946240	3948240	these things to happen
3948720	3949440	in
3949520	3955520	An automatic way and you basically are like well, this is an outrage but like
3957280	3960880	God is just and god will fix it in some way and therefore I don't have to
3961440	3966560	Um, or power doesn't have to know like actually only power can revise power
3966880	3969840	If you look for example at like germany in 1945
3970560	3972560	Let's take germany in 1945
3974240	3976240	The occupying regime
3976960	3978960	american military government, um
3979760	3984960	Mg I've got the acronym has the same powers as hitler right not only can they
3985440	3990800	You know, they can destroy anything that hitler created. They're not like oh, well the ss is losing its prestige
3990800	3995760	He wants to join the ss and you know anymore now in 1946 like no, that's not how it worked
3996160	4000480	You know when east germany was shut down it wasn't like the stasi is losing its prestige
4000960	4002960	Right, it was like no actually
4003520	4006080	There is a new power over this and the new power
4006560	4009600	Has the power to just force this to cease to exist
4010240	4012240	and it will cease to exist and
4012880	4018080	So like if you look at the denazification of germany and the sort of level of
4018800	4021280	There are two things that stand out about that one is
4021760	4028720	The level of force required to denazify germany and the level of violence required to denazify germany
4029120	4031120	the level of violence after
4031840	4038720	Conquering germany, which took quite a bit of violence the level of violence needed to enforce that was almost zero
4039120	4042000	There was a huge fear, you know of basically
4042640	4046560	You know the occupying forces are coming into occupied germany. They're like this is the most
4047200	4050000	Propagandized nationalist population in history
4050480	4054240	Hitler has been filling their heads full of pure crazy for 13 years
4054640	4058720	Like clearly what's going to happen is they're going to start like these like guerrilla movements
4058800	4062880	They're going to go all like werewolf. There's going to be ied's like there's going to be
4063600	4067200	None of that happened. Yeah, almost none of it same thing in japan
4067760	4071760	Incredibly fanatical population drilled with all this propaganda
4072240	4076000	You take absolute power over them and they're like quiet as lambs
4076880	4083120	And their minds change, but that didn't happen in afghanistan and something about no that didn't happen in afghanistan
4083680	4086800	that didn't have happened in afghanistan because basically
4087600	4088720	the
4088720	4091040	When you look at the way in which
4092000	4098640	Like or like the specific directives like jcs 1067 is the directive for occupying germany
4099040	4104400	You read this and it's basically a document of imperialism and it includes things like
4104880	4109120	Americans are not allowed to fraternize with germans. They're not allowed to make friends with germans
4109200	4113360	We have to understand get them to understand that this is a conquered country
4114320	4119600	You know whereas in afghanistan, it's like we didn't conquer you would conquer we didn't conquer afghanistan
4119600	4122800	We liberated afghanistan. We're here to advise you
4123520	4126720	And so we're not in command. We're not telling you what to do
4127280	4131520	So we kind of basically just pass it aggressively want you to do what we say
4132000	4136960	And yeah, and we're going to give you more money if you do what we say, but we're not in command here
4137040	4142720	That's imperialism. My god. We would never do that. That's bad. That would cause instant, you know revolutions
4143200	4147120	Like absolutely terrible, right and the thing is so basically
4148160	4149360	You know
4149360	4154400	It's only that absolute is the total conquering attitude that actually affects change
4154880	4160960	There's a there's a there's a an analogy that the victorians used to use which is grasping the nettle
4161440	4167920	A nettle is a plant you'll find it in the pacific northwest a lot and in england with stinging hairs on it
4168240	4173760	And supposedly if you touch a nettle, I have done this and it's very painful if you touch a nettle it will hurt
4174080	4178720	But if you grasp it firmly it will like compress the hairs so that they don't sting
4179280	4184080	And basically the lesson of grasping the nettle, which is something also very relevant in parenting
4185040	4189920	you know weak parents are the ones who yell at their kids and the
4191920	4197200	The the the sense you're not a parent. Are you um, you know, but I'd work with kids for
4197920	4203120	A few decades now the the but I was just thinking about like the like showing up to school. This is this is why you're uh
4204160	4209680	constitutionally opposed to showing up to school board meetings or making these little laws against wokeness here and there
4209840	4215360	Yeah, yeah, that's just you're just touching the nettle. You're not actually you're just touching the nettle
4215440	4222480	You're not actually grasping the nettle and so you'll basically see you know in any situation with kids like
4222960	4227280	The nice substitute teacher is in a room that is a war zone
4227840	4231680	Whereas the extremely strict teacher never raises her voice
4232160	4238080	right and and the the like the the sense of that and that's just a
4238560	4245680	Basic principle of like governance and management which again of power which again is completely lost here and so basically
4246480	4251760	um, you know the occupiers in 45 came in with this extremely
4253440	4258000	Determined attitude which actually in Germany was quite rough in japan. It was not rough
4258000	4260000	But in in Germany they were quite rough
4260480	4265760	But we were more lenient to japan than to germany. Yes because it was being run by macarthur specifically
4266080	4266400	um
4266400	4269280	And macarthur was kind of an old asia hand who kind of you know
4269680	4275520	Had a sense of what to do whereas there were a lot of like ideological fanatics in the the government of the new germany
4276000	4279040	You may have heard of the like morgan fowl plan or stuff like that
4279120	4282400	um, but yeah, it was like it was like it was
4283440	4288160	There were things like intentional starvation policies and shit, which nobody talks about. Um, yeah
4289520	4291680	and um
4291680	4297760	No, I could I could see like psychologically because we're closer related to germans that we would really want to kind of
4298400	4300400	Beat it out of them. The ideology
4301040	4308160	Of the time you can go. I always recommend this to people go on the internet. There's a little movie from 1945
4308560	4310080	This is the seuss one
4310080	4313600	The yeah, the seuss one hitler lives hitler lives. It's absolutely worth seeing
4314400	4316400	and um
4316960	4323200	And and just don't like worry about the fact that you're typing the word hitler lives into a google search box
4323280	4325840	It's a historical documentary. It's very anti-nazi
4326560	4331360	to say the least um, and and your mind will be blown and the um
4332480	4334480	But yeah, you know, so
4334640	4338960	I think a better example in some ways is the deconstruction of east germany
4339440	4347280	Because again, it's like when in 89 99 right, you know, because when you have a real regime change in a country
4347760	4349760	Everyone's life changes
4349760	4354880	Like there's no like everyone's life changes. Every institution is different
4355520	4360480	Anything that remains is reconstructed. Most things do not remain
4361360	4362400	and
4362400	4368160	There's no like there's no sense that like the stasi was going to be turned into like a you know
4369200	4374560	Something different in 1989 or the ss was going to be turned into something different in 1945
4374960	4379440	That's not the way it works. And so the thing is that if you basically
4380320	4383520	Are really talking about a change of regime
4384160	4386160	You're talking about basically
4386800	4393520	Taking all of these powerful institutions inside or outside the government and basically
4394720	4400800	Deconstructing them and your experience just across the board by fiat across the board by fiat and you know
4401120	4407200	The experience of being because you're basically saying you're declaring that these were unofficial parts of the government
4407280	4412400	And then you're reorganizing that part of the government. Yeah, and and you know the experience of being
4413280	4419920	In one of these institutions or part of this sort of ruling class like that should not
4420720	4422720	Be a like
4422800	4429520	Painful experience. It is a little painful when basically, you know, you're a major in the stasi
4429520	4435920	You put your whole career into this like whatever you've served faithfully serve the german democratic republic
4436320	4438960	And like one day you're like, I know there were problems
4439040	4443840	It wasn't perfect like but you know like what what are you going to do? And then one day one day one day
4443840	4445840	It's all over right, you know
4445840	4451600	And the your ideology the day before it's all over is just like
4452560	4454960	We are the guardians of the revolution
4455680	4460320	You know if like western imperialists subjugate our country. We are
4460880	4468320	Professional revolutionaries. We will conspire in the cafes. We will plant our bombs. We will be just like linen and Stalin
4468880	4473920	And then you realize you're not like linen and Stalin the day after you're like, oh, I was just a bureaucrat
4474320	4476320	Guess what happens to you as a bureaucrat?
4476560	4478000	You get a pension
4478000	4480000	Okay, you're retired, you know, there's
4480080	4482800	Are you saying that we have to pay off all the gender studies?
4483200	4490480	Professors all of them all the critical theorists. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely because the thing is that basically
4491040	4494080	that is absolutely because that
4494320	4500320	Is the only way to respect what they were actually doing what they were actually doing
4500800	4505440	Was not wrong because they were faithfully serving the old regime
4506320	4512560	They were okay. Maybe if they did something especially evil like that could be looked at but it's like
4513200	4515200	the principle that
4515600	4517600	this is why like
4518000	4520000	Germany today still pays pensions
4520080	4523680	I believe not only to stasi officers even to some vermarked officers
4524320	4527760	Right because basically what you're saying is that
4528400	4530400	If you say to these people
4530400	4533440	You're an alien force. You're not part of society
4534640	4536640	Like you're saying
4538320	4541040	We don't really own you we don't really care about you
4541840	4547840	You're an outcast you should go and plot your next revolution because that's the only way you'll have a future
4548240	4551280	Whereas if you're saying to them, yeah, you know what it's like
4552240	4559040	Yeah, you were a professor of marxist linenist literature at the moscow university in 1987 like what is your future?
4559600	4561600	I don't know was it bad
4561760	4567440	Read a book read a novel like was it bad to study marxist linenist literature like yeah, okay?
4567600	4573920	You know you read literature. It's fine. You're smart. You can teach school, you know, like, you know the there's like
4574480	4576320	the sense of
4576320	4578320	sort of responsible
4578880	4582080	Leadership is very much the sense of like
4583760	4585760	If you have never dehumanize
4586240	4590880	Never be human if you have a regime that feels that it represents
4591520	4593520	Only a part of the country
4594000	4596000	That's like very bad
4596240	4598880	and so the sense of basically
4599840	4603760	any kind of monarchy any kind of new regime of any form
4604560	4606160	in
4606400	4612320	This country like one of the things that is going to be kind of its best biggest selling point
4612720	4615360	Is that it's ending the kind of cold civil war?
4615920	4618160	And so the sense of basically
4618960	4622720	You know, what are you if you were like a critical theorist english professor like
4623360	4625920	Okay, you were someone who's
4627040	4629840	Entire world basically just a preacher
4630560	4636000	With yeah, if you're someone whose entire world was consumed by the ideology of the old regime
4636720	4637760	um
4637760	4640240	The old regime has turned to dust and fallen away
4640960	4646080	And like you can't go on doing that like there's no world in which people are going to pay you to do that
4646480	4647440	but
4647440	4649440	That doesn't make you a bad person
4649920	4654400	That doesn't make it just means that you had a bullshit job under the old regime. Guess what?
4654960	4657520	A lot of people had bullshit jobs under the old regime
4657840	4663360	Right because like a lot of bullshit was done, right? And so the sense of basically
4664640	4668880	It's over and like everyone should be fine with that
4669920	4673440	It's over and that's fine rather than it's over and like
4674000	4677520	Now begins the vengeance, right? You know, it's just like
4678080	4682560	So why why do you think that when biden first came in he's like i'm the we're the party of unity
4682560	4684800	We're going to unify the country and at this point in time
4685280	4690560	He's now more or less actively like saying ultramaga. He's like doing this weird kind of rhetoric
4690640	4695280	It seems kind of impotent, but it's still kind of dangerous where he's other half of the country
4695360	4700720	Why would he do that? Like if that's not to support because he's you know, leaning on
4702080	4705040	The half that supports him and he is like, um
4706000	4713840	So he's caught in the trap of his unity. His unity is fundamentally hegemonic in in form and it can't basically
4714560	4718240	This sense of like I own my base, but I own your base too
4719040	4721200	Is the kind of unity that's like
4722160	4724160	You know, that's a dominant
4724160	4728640	like and of course dominating basically the flyover people and basically
4729360	4731360	sort of, um
4731840	4733840	You know
4734720	4739040	Yeah, keeping them keeping this outcast or deplorables or keeping basically
4739680	4745680	Like them in this sort of frame of mind where they're like you should be good enough to vote for me, you know, um
4746240	4750720	In in sort of this like keeping the kind of structure between the aristocracy
4751360	4757120	sort of blue state aristocracy and the red state bourgeoisie is is like, you know, you
4757680	4760720	should aspire to be one of us and if you don't maybe your children will
4761440	4762640	and
4762640	4768400	It's not like that does not represent like there's sort of no actually like
4769040	4773680	Oh, I care about red state people and I want them to be able to live their lives in like a red state way
4774160	4778080	No, do you think that there's something in the system that's causing him to not be able to do that?
4778240	4782560	Like if you wanted to be the the unifying president and at this point it's fallen apart
4782640	4783440	I mean
4783440	4789680	Whether regardless if it's him or not who's making these decisions and writing these talking points like if that was what they wanted to do
4789680	4791920	What's keeping them from unifying?
4792720	4794880	Well, you'd have to actually out trumping trump
4795840	4798960	You know, you you'd because you lose your own
4799840	4802880	base essentially, it's like you have to give
4803760	4806400	If you're gonna like basically say
4807360	4809200	I mean
4809200	4812160	One of the things that you see sort of american
4813280	4816640	Leftism or many leftisms do is they sort of
4817440	4819440	Circulate their clients
4819840	4825840	And so there's always this sort of client population, you know, where a hundred years ago. It's the working class
4825920	4828160	It's the factory worker, right?
4828160	4830720	And the thing is that at a certain point
4831360	4836640	The factory worker is no longer an asset and what we really need is basically
4837360	4840160	Instead of a class war we needed a race and culture war
4840800	4846960	Or we're like our asset is like black americans. No way. We actually prefer mexicans
4847840	4854000	Um, they're more of them now and so like we're gonna let the mexicans take the blacks jobs
4854320	4858400	Right or whatever right, you know and and this sense of
4859280	4860800	and like
4860800	4864480	The working class like stuck with these people for
4865200	4867200	A very long time you have the union
4867840	4870560	Midwest union people right who basically
4871200	4876720	Have been sort of voting democratic or we're voting democratic on autopilot for 50 or 60 years
4876800	4880160	Until they realized that they were actually no longer
4881040	4886720	The like mascot. They were now the goat. Um, if you look at the populations that
4887520	4889200	Who voted for f dr?
4889200	4892080	Well, who voted for f dr was a thin, you know
4892640	4895520	cream of aristocrats like him and then
4896800	4898800	The solid south
4899040	4903280	Though, you know old democratic segregationist regimes who were
4903760	4909360	Democrats because robert lee was a democrat and i've always voted democrat and i'm robert lee was a good man
4909840	4912240	You know and then the inner city catholics
4912880	4918880	Right and the inner city catholics and slavs who you're like what because they don't exist anymore
4919440	4921680	They all got but what was their attraction like?
4922720	4924560	um, again
4924560	4932320	Traditional ethnic traditional ethnic power politics, right and so those were ethnic machines and those machines were basically
4932880	4934880	had always been
4934960	4938720	You know the democrats where america's sort of conservative party in a way
4939280	4943280	But they were also the party of like the catholics and the inner city
4943680	4945680	Like old, you know camity hall
4945920	4949680	And like the old sort of these old style political machines
4950240	4953520	And these old style political machines basically like
4954160	4957920	You know when the solid south puts f dr into power
4958640	4962560	They're setting into motion the forces that would destroy the solid south
4963280	4968000	They have no idea they don't think of themselves when they vote for democrats is voting for liberals
4968400	4971200	They think of themselves as voting for robert lee, right?
4971280	4973840	And so they were the same thing with the union democrats
4974000	4979840	Yeah, they kept on voting for robert lee up until like the 1960s when they're like wait a second
4980720	4982880	Like this is no longer the party of robert lee, right?
4983120	4986720	And so it's sort of easy when you have a client base
4987280	4989280	That trusts you like that
4989440	4994720	Those are the people that are going to get abused because when you can take someone for granted
4995440	4996800	you know
4996800	5001360	That's who you abuse and and so you know like the sense of
5002960	5009360	You know, there's clearly in sort of voting in the new deal which would eventually bring them the civil rights movement
5009680	5013520	There's a sense in which you know, the mark cistern false consciousness
5014080	5018480	Is applicable to all of these segregationists who were voting for f dr
5018960	5025200	They sort of knew he wasn't really a segregationist, but you know, like robert lee was a democrat, right? And so
5027040	5030320	When you look at the various like sort of solid
5031200	5035200	Blocks in um india to have this wonderful term which is vote bank
5035280	5039200	Which is like a group of like ethnic votes that a politician can count on
5039760	5044240	So, you know, when you look at basically like the like democratic vote bank or whatever
5044960	5047040	um, you're basically seeing
5047840	5056240	Yeah, I mean like certainly like so with biden is there's something about the uh his base his vote bank that needs that
5056640	5058640	antagonism with this other
5058960	5064640	Vote bank that he's locked into this party policy. Yeah, he's he's called civil war as you call it. Yes. Yes
5064800	5069520	I mean blue state america is deeply locked into this cold cold civil war because there's really
5070320	5072640	Not much they can say anymore
5073360	5080400	To get, you know, the white working class or whatever. Yeah, right, you know, and and there's but there's still like there's a lot of
5080800	5085920	Aspirational support out there. There's a lot of people who sort of look up to the upper class
5086400	5089280	There's a lot of people like there's a lot of that, you know
5089920	5094800	Even that like, you know, I mean this is where biden came from in the 70s
5094960	5097440	He's going around Delaware, which is after all a southern state
5097840	5103520	Basically telling everyone, you know, what a bad idea busing and desegregation are I mean, he's lived that long, right?
5103600	5107920	You know, and so in the 90s he's talking about super predators, you know
5108400	5111920	Like I mean, this is a very empty hollow man
5112400	5116080	Which is just sort of the voice of the power around him. Yeah, exactly
5116320	5121680	So he's a great. He's a great image of what we're actually dealing with in a while. Yeah, yeah, right, right, right?
5121680	5127200	I like I mean, I let's let's elect him again in 2024 as he gets older and older
5127600	5134160	Um, I think it would be beautiful and and the uh, he might actually just start drooling in front of his teleprompter
5134320	5138320	the autumn of the page if he hasn't done that already, you know, and um
5139840	5142720	Yeah, so so so like when you
5143920	5145440	you know
5145440	5150400	You sort of imagine, you know monarchy this like exotic system of government, which is, you know
5150880	5155840	The system of government that like 99 of all people in history have lived under
5156320	5160800	And then you're like, but it could be insane and do weird insane things and I'm like
5161520	5165440	Actually, there's a lot of insanity there right now. You're just used to it
5165680	5171680	Well, especially if if you I think there might be three kind of state you said there's a wartime and then the peacetime kind of
5171920	5172960	uh
5172960	5179680	Executive but there could be like a cleanup executive and then kind of a prosperous executive and then a stabilizing executive like there's kind of
5179760	5182960	Yeah, the cleanup executive is definitely like the wartime
5183600	5190320	executive essentially and just being able to explicitly call out power and and to regulate power through one
5191040	5193280	explicit means rather than having going through this
5193840	5195840	oligarchical
5195920	5201280	Institutional process that gets all these weird ideas in it that it can't shake down if you have like one
5201840	5203840	free agent that
5204160	5205040	all
5205040	5207040	Through which all power flows
5207280	5213280	And the potential to clean up and then to also make decisions or at least to make decisions cleanly that can then be
5214320	5215680	held account
5215680	5221040	One way or another rather than it being lost in all these processes right is much
5221840	5227200	Yeah, yeah, it's much more. It's much more. I mean, and it's just like you look at I constantly say this
5227200	5231360	But like if you look at anything that gets done in the real world today, it's done by a monarchy
5231680	5235200	Drive a car is made by a monarchy, you know that microphone in front of you
5235520	5240080	It was made by a monarchy, which is a company in China, which is another monarchy
5240160	5242800	So like the set of like if you look around you
5243360	5249440	You see a world made by monarchies within monarchies and and like the
5250640	5256080	If there was an effective oligarchical or republican way to run a company
5256800	5260640	somebody would have that worked better than that somebody certainly would have found it
5261280	5262160	and
5262160	5268000	Because there's nothing stopping you from having a company that's run by a congress and a judiciary and a president and all that right?
5268640	5270640	and um
5270720	5272640	But but that's a way to run a railroad
5272640	5278320	But in order for us to make that leap there has to be a huge change of view by the american
5278960	5282960	Populus towards power and and one thing is to expose it like you're doing
5282960	5288160	But it's another to like try to get people on the same page because everybody that I tell your ideas to recoils
5288480	5293600	I'm living in washington and portland. So, you know, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course a washington state
5293600	5298320	Yeah, right and and and and and so and and they recoil
5299120	5300960	in a way
5300960	5306960	They recoil for a couple of different reasons. They recoil at a sense of alieness and they also feel
5308080	5308880	um
5308880	5310880	subconsciously that
5312320	5315200	A source of meaning in their lives would be taken away
5316160	5317120	and
5317120	5319120	The sense of having power
5319760	5324640	For them is not about having a government that treats them. Well, it's about
5325280	5329360	mattering in a sense and this idea that they would no longer matter
5330160	5332000	in that way
5332000	5338080	Feels emasculating it feels like basically people have a natural power drive
5338560	5340800	and that sort of power drive is kind of
5341600	5348240	Being exploited in them to give this them this illusion of mattering. Whereas it's actually sort of turns into
5349280	5350000	support
5350000	5351600	it's like basically
5351600	5353600	Your desire to matter
5354240	5360160	This guy, um, this great political scientist Guy Tana Mosca from over 100 years ago had this great term
5360160	5362240	Which is a political formula
5362240	5366640	And a political formula is whatever you believe that causes you to support the government
5366960	5372720	So you might be in ancient egypt and you might believe that pharaoh should be on the throne because pharaoh is the son of
5372800	5378720	You know the great grandson of god or something and yeah myth and basically if pharaoh is not on the throne
5378800	5383840	Then the sun will not come up in the morning, right? And that's a political formula
5384480	5389200	And you know 20th century political formulas tend to resolve around
5390080	5392560	I feel powerful because I support the government
5393360	5397120	Or you think or are you right or you know all of these
5398160	5402320	Yeah, all of these things giving you a sense of meaning and importance
5402960	5407120	And the thing is you're sort of trading what you don't realize is that you're trading
5408000	5410000	That in order for this basically
5410640	5415840	pornographic feeling of meaning and importance which is pornographic because it's not real
5416320	5420160	You're not actually in the decision loop when you look at Ukraine
5420240	5426000	You're not actually like moving ukraine and you know armies around on the battlefield like a chess board
5426480	5431760	You're just having this kind of pornographic feeling of feeling like you are defending ukraine
5431840	5436960	Just like when you view pornography, you're like i'm i'm doing it with this girl, but you're not
5437440	5439440	you know and and so
5440080	5442080	what that basically
5443200	5445200	That sort of change of
5446560	5447760	That myth
5447840	5453840	That change yeah that myth that formula and what rejecting that formula sort of allows you to do
5454480	5456480	is basically to change
5457040	5459040	exchange this
5459440	5463200	To set aside this delusional sense of power and importance
5463840	5466320	And replace it with something that actually matters
5466960	5473280	You can become if you basically can conquer your emotional desire for importance
5473520	5478560	Then she called it like political nofap at some point. Yeah. Yeah. It's like political nofap or it's like, you know
5478640	5483200	The thing that I always uh, you know the example that I always use I don't think this actually works in real life
5483600	5488080	But um, there's this um legendary monkey banana trap where you basically
5488480	5493280	Have a banana and you and it's inside a little enclosure and the monkey puts its hand in the box
5493760	5498000	And then cannot get its hand out of the box without letting go with a banana
5498400	5503200	And so and then the hunter comes along and cracks it on the head and eats fried monkey for dinner, right?
5503360	5505120	and and like
5505120	5512400	And you're like there are a lot of bananas outside the box, but you have to be able to let go of the banana
5513040	5518160	And the sort of the problem of letting go of the banana if you look at
5518880	5523440	The capacity here is why I'm optimistic about the ability
5523920	5525920	For people to solve this problem
5526640	5534080	Which they clearly haven't been able to do in the past. I'm optimistic about it because first of all when you compare
5535440	5538960	Americans today and the way they interact with politics
5539600	5544720	To the way they interacted a hundred years ago. They're much more apathetic
5545200	5550880	They're sort of much less like they're much less ready ready. For example to engage in political violence
5551600	5554720	Um, they're much to show up to seven hour zoom meetings
5555280	5560640	Seven hour, you know, or seven hour like riots, right? You know, like you can't you know
5561360	5565120	like like the um, but the race riots in 2020
5566320	5572400	Yeah, but the thing is the last time you see like white people rioting is like the 40s for example
5572960	5579520	um, or you know, even like january 6 is like this incredibly pathetic thing like it's not
5579520	5584960	It's pretty well, I don't know according to the democrats like it's a national holiday now
5585040	5591040	They have the ceremonies and stuff about it. It's pretty powerful. It's pretty it's pretty limp, uh, you know and and like
5591280	5593280	Yeah, I'll show you right, you know
5594400	5599680	You want to see you want you want to see a riot, you know, um the um, um
5600400	5606960	It's it's it's pretty limp and but but but we're we're expending that in a pornographic way on twitter by
5607280	5611600	Doing all this culture. We're you're saying is this culture where stuff is just pornographic
5612400	5618720	It's a pornographic experience release and you know the thing that can compete with pornography is sex
5618880	5620720	It's like basically
5620720	5624480	Whenever you sort of show people how to have actual sex
5625040	5626400	um, you know
5626400	5629600	That is the one way to pull them away from their porn and so
5630400	5632400	The thing is I'm like no
5633200	5637200	What you're doing cannot result in any real political change, but actually
5638720	5643280	Real things can happen and here's how and that's sort of exciting even
5644000	5645920	If it doesn't have
5645920	5650720	That's exciting at a different level and in a different sense because you're like, okay
5651280	5654480	They're not close to happening. It's not about to happen
5655040	5660320	And what all this sort of pornographic politics is offering me is the sense that like this is about to happen
5660400	5665440	Well, like elect trump and like amazing things will happen and you know, or like we'll let you know
5665440	5669600	And and I'm like no none of this nothing will happen as a result of these elections
5669760	5674160	But the thing is if you want to think in a way that would
5675440	5678560	Lead if you can get other people to think in this way
5679200	5681200	Real things to happen
5681280	5683840	There's something actually more exciting about that
5684800	5688240	And it's exciting in a like subtle and ironic way
5688800	5693520	The idea that the way to have real power is like give up your power
5694080	5696160	Has this ironic quality to it
5696880	5699440	And the thing is that we are living
5701200	5703440	We have the most ironic population history
5703920	5709840	There's never been any period in history when like irony was his mass market
5709920	5715360	The memes are a flowing my friend never anywhere close and so basically
5716080	5720560	How is irony a political force like I've heard you bring this up, but what is it about it?
5720560	5724640	It's a political force because it basically allows you to like say like
5725600	5730640	Fuck it in a really interesting way. There's the none of the apocetic like you know that no
5731040	5733600	Not in did you know the british show black mirror?
5734400	5739920	Oh, yeah, yeah, if there's a there's a black mirror episode I always point people to where
5741440	5744640	The population elects a cartoon character
5745280	5748960	As a joke or is it like comment or is this something right?
5749360	5753440	Yeah, you know and it's like or if you look at something like sort of storm area 51
5753760	5759520	That didn't come off area 51 wasn't stormed. Oh, yeah, but it kind of gives you a sense of like
5760640	5762000	that
5762080	5764080	The sense of
5764960	5768880	Like there will be whenever this thing comes crashing down
5769120	5772800	There will be like a ludic a playful sense to it
5773200	5776320	Much as there was like especially like shekels of akia
5776960	5779920	In 89 with like the the velvet revolution
5780560	5787280	You know, um, you had this real sense of playfulness to it like an important aspect the venture of the velvet
5787760	5789760	revolution was this like
5790400	5795600	Sort of a banned plastic people of the universe. It was kind of velvet underground influence
5795760	5801040	Like, you know, and so you had a revostov hovel who's just like ironic playwright becomes the you know
5801520	5804480	It was from being a dissident to the president in Czechoslovakia
5805200	5806480	Um
5806480	5811600	We saw the little bit of that in the trucker uh convoy in canada. There was a communal thing
5811680	5818480	But the weird thing about that was that that's where truto like showed the power of the state to people of their finances
5818480	5821200	Which is really scary and people took it like
5821840	5824080	Yeah, and people took it like way too
5824800	5826800	Like seriously in a way
5827520	5834160	And his his his move to no the banks. No the truckers the truckers took themselves way too seriously
5834480	5839520	I'm sort of not seriously enough like they didn't like like like there was yeah
5839600	5845520	I mean, they were they were kind of larping in the end. They weren't like it wasn't it sounds like you're you're advocating for larping
5845520	5850640	But there's like some sort of truth sincerity this room. Yeah, there's there's like there's like
5851200	5855360	You sort of do it as a lark, but it becomes real. It's like a basically
5856160	5860240	The sense of being a sort of a joke that makes itself real
5860880	5862880	I think will be kind of part
5863440	5869600	Of this thing. That sounds kind of like apocalyptic or revelatory. Well, it's in a way. I mean, I mean
5870240	5874080	We talked about Ukraine Ukraine elected a comedian as president, right?
5874400	5878480	You know and so there's this sense of like
5879600	5884960	It will feel sort of almost accidental. It won't have this sort of like
5886480	5888720	Patriots rise up to like, you know
5889520	5891680	feeling it won't it will be like
5893040	5895440	We can't take this seriously like a carnival, right?
5896160	5898640	Yeah, it will have it. It will have a very joyous
5899120	5905200	Feel and not a very like a carnival. It will feel very joyous and it will not feel like
5906480	5909760	And it will feel sort of that image irreversible
5910640	5914560	coupled with the outcome of like somebody with absolute power completely just
5915120	5918640	Liquidating all the institutions and rebooting them, which is like the most serious thing
5918640	5922560	I mean, it's comedic like like I read I've been reading your sub-stack
5922880	5926240	We get to the part like well, how are we going to change things and it's so out
5926640	5930800	It's just so absurd. It's like we're just going to tear everything apart. We're going to take complete authority
5930800	5937920	It's like what he can't do that. Yeah, and it breaks my brain every time I right and and and and that the sense of basically like
5938560	5945440	Voting for that or voting to be like, you know, it's like, you know, one of the ways I sort of picture it is as I'm like
5946160	5948160	imagine you're in
5948720	5953120	Like the little room with the astronaut at like the end of 2001, right?
5953120	5957760	And you're just in this like weird space and like there's like playing food all right Dave, right?
5957760	5962640	You know, I'm sorry Dave. I can't do that, you know and and like but there's one difference
5963040	5967440	There's a red button on the wall and under the red button. It says if you press this button
5968480	5970480	everything will change
5970640	5971840	well
5971840	5976320	serious sober like a hard-working respectable people
5977280	5981280	Are not going to grown-ups are not going to press that button because they're like
5981280	5984160	We could just be shot into out into space. That would be a change
5984560	5987680	but you know who presses the button is basically
5988640	5992880	immature people childlike people like people who are
5993760	5995040	have
5995040	6000160	a sense of fun which is much bigger than their sense of seriousness and so, you know
6001760	6008640	The people of america today are not minute men. They are not like the like paul revere is not in the building
6008800	6012320	Like they do not act out of like a deep sense of
6012400	6019760	Have you seen every couple months? Like there's this really stupid group of like supposed white supremacist, but it's totally an fbi sting
6019760	6024080	It's like there's just footage of them. Do you know what i'm talking about? Like they're the people's army or something
6024240	6031520	Yeah, and everybody's laughing at them. Nobody believes that that actually is serious right and and and and so the sense of like
6032560	6034000	you know
6034000	6036000	that sense of
6036800	6038800	Like really
6039280	6044160	Deep comedy and irony like that's so ironic that it's real
6044960	6049520	Is like really crucial to that sort of spirit
6050400	6053920	So how did you get this idea of any possible regime change? How did you come to this?
6055360	6057360	conception um
6058560	6062240	I think that it's sort of part of
6066160	6072240	Kind of being brought up in the american upper class and kind of understanding
6073200	6075200	it's like spirit
6075920	6077360	in a way
6077360	6078240	and
6078240	6080240	it's like when you
6081200	6084880	A good way to sort of track the spirit is in popular entertainment
6085280	6091120	It's like imagine if you took a film like inception and you put it in movie theater in 1962
6091840	6096640	Like people would be like coming out of their theater just like grabbing their heads like stunned monkeys, right?
6097040	6100800	You know even in like 1992 that would be like a cult film
6101200	6105040	But like 20 years after that it's like a blockbuster and people are like
6105040	6109040	Oh, yeah, there's three levels reality and I fall back into the bathtub every the next month, right?
6109040	6112800	You know and it's like their ability to sort of switch frames
6113280	6114000	Yeah
6114000	6119040	Is like really really great and it's sort of much easier to just like
6119680	6122960	They're sort of their attachment when you're in this sort of ironic
6123920	6128240	Sophisticated state of mind. You're like attachment to the prison frame
6128960	6130960	Is just not that great
6131840	6133120	and so
6133120	6140800	To like move you sort of along the ground is still like hard. It's hard to reason people into something
6141520	6143920	but like when you're just like no
6144880	6150000	Throw away everything about the way you see the world and like change to see it in this other way
6150960	6152960	There's a lot of people who are just like, okay
6153120	6156880	Sure, right and and that comes out of a kind of frivolousness
6157440	6161280	That comes out of a like lack of virtue in a sense
6161920	6166080	But like politics is the art of the possible and the thing is if you're looking for basically
6167360	6169360	a politics of virtue
6169840	6172960	to like unite a fundamentally
6173040	6176240	Unsterious and unvirtuous population
6176400	6180960	But there's still perfor larping like this bloodbath this civil war on twitter, right?
6181040	6184560	Yeah, right, right and and it's just like and it's just like you can do
6185520	6186560	like
6186560	6193120	And you know the feeling of sort of popping people out of that is very refreshing and like the whole sort of
6193840	6198240	framework of the debate the cold civil war the like issues or whatever
6198960	6202080	Very tiresome very uninteresting very unchewy
6202640	6204640	Your ability to get ahead
6205120	6208880	left-wing politics was sort of designed to get people ahead
6209440	6214400	Or it's like works sort of like like up up the classes. Is that we mean like yeah or up
6214880	6218720	You know up the like rise and like have a career and a profession
6219120	6222720	You know, it's like one of the ways that I described like the early new deal
6222800	6226080	Is that it really was like a start-up Washington in a lot of ways
6226560	6230800	And like you're like life cycle of being in the new deal had this like start-up quality
6230880	6237120	Like you would graduate from say Harvard with a degree in this new science of economics in like 1935
6237920	6243280	And you know somebody who knows somebody who knows like Felix Frankfurter or Tommy Corcoran or something
6243920	6249520	And so you're like make some inquiries and one day you get a call and the voice on the telephone
6250320	6253040	it's like would you like to come to Washington and
6254000	6259360	You know work for us and you're like what what would I be doing and the voice will be like we'll figure it out
6259760	6266240	You know and you get there and you get in an office and your boss is like here's three million dollars go electrify arkansas
6266640	6271280	Right, you know and that same person like 80 years later like their existence is
6271840	6275600	They're basically a tracy flick, you know the the great film election
6276160	6277040	um
6277040	6280160	Alexander pain film from like 25 years ago or so
6280800	6282800	Reese Witherspoon
6283040	6284560	High school student government, right?
6284560	6289440	You know, so you're like tracy flick and your goal is to get ahead in everything and be like a goody-goody
6290000	6293680	And you're on the high school newspaper and you go to Harvard and you know
6294240	6296240	study political science
6296320	6302080	And then you're like I want to go to Washington. Okay. I'm gonna like intern for like
6302720	6307120	A house member doing like a constituent service and like, you know after a while
6307120	6312960	They might let me talk to the lobbyists who writes the legislation and you'd be like see here's a line of legislation
6313040	6315520	I took care of for that. It wouldn't say that if I hadn't been there
6315600	6321440	You didn't write it you got it from the right lobbyist or activist or whatever, right, you know, and so basically
6322240	6324400	This is a very saturated system
6325520	6331280	In terms of its ability to offer the things to ambitious people that ambitious people
6331840	6333520	They need a
6333520	6338160	similar simulacra of power, but you don't actually do anything you don't get three million dollars to electrify
6339120	6345600	Yeah, and if you actually do something it's because you work really hard to get a bunch of status
6346080	6349920	And then after you got that status you've got some real actual power
6350800	6352800	and
6353520	6356480	You know, yeah, it's like a really um
6357600	6362160	It's like it's really grueling and it rewards like people who are not
6362720	6368080	As imaginative and talented like people who are really imaginative talented want to it, right?
6368960	6376560	And because it fucking sucks, you know, and and so you have like sort of all of these things are kind of
6378320	6383040	ripe for something different in a way and like one way to think about
6383920	6387920	Sort of the way that something different exists is to think about
6388560	6390560	Or to sort of
6391280	6399280	Define the different thing that you want to exist is to think about sort of how it should think about what we have at present
6399360	6401840	How does the new regime think about the old regime?
6402480	6410080	What does basically the soviet union in 1987 look like from the perspective of russia in 1997?
6410560	6415280	How you look back on the old regime and it shouldn't be like oh man, I miss the old regime
6415280	6419840	Wow, they could really get that shit done now our garbage doesn't get picked up. It should not be like that
6419920	6423040	It should be the opposite of that, right? And so, you know
6423840	6425840	if you're looking
6426080	6428160	at like
6428160	6429600	I mean
6429600	6430960	sort of the old
6430960	6434000	america from the perspective of an america where
6435360	6440000	Even just basic things like you can walk safely anywhere any time of day or night, right?
6440080	6443280	You know, think about how impossible it is would be to get that
6444000	6451840	Basic simple feature of like the government monopoly on violence back, right? You know and and like speaking from the west coast
6451920	6453680	I mean, we're kind of like
6453680	6459200	Yeah, yeah experiencing class here. Portland. Did you say portland? Yeah, portland and seattle olympia
6459920	6463600	Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Sure. Sure. I've seen it all right
6463920	6469120	And you're saying you're saying to get back to my first question the opportunity or the the
6470000	6476400	The this regime is is selecting for madness on a number of different levels and then also selecting for people who have
6477280	6481760	Lot lack of talent or imagination because they would probably just want to be in a startup
6482480	6484480	um to begin with
6484720	6486720	So this new uh
6486800	6493280	Era or new field will select for itself the leader that has the qualities that would maximize that
6494160	6498800	Yeah, I mean, I think that really people underrate the extent to which
6499760	6504880	sort of the structure determines the ideologies and the virtues and so
6505760	6507760	basically
6508160	6509920	any sort of
6509920	6511920	monarchy at all would basically
6512880	6515120	See that sort of bringing this like
6515920	6517760	Sort of, you know, you know how hercules
6518640	6522720	Sends the river into the audience tables, right? You know, uh, he he has
6522960	6528160	You know in the myth of hercules. He has all these impossible tasks to do which he does in these impossible ways
6528240	6533280	He's like i'm gonna clean out the dirtiest stables in the world. So like let's redirect river through it, right?
6533600	6535760	you know and and sending
6536480	6537840	like
6537840	6539840	it's hard the sort of the
6540400	6542400	course of like
6542560	6546320	kind of healing and repair in that sense that
6547120	6551520	Would be the obvious course for any monarch seems to me
6552320	6553520	like
6553520	6557920	If you took like j random ceo and made him king
6558480	6562000	They'd probably are ceo of washington or you know
6563280	6570320	Imperial president or whatever they'd probably mostly come out with the same kinds of things. I think it's definitely
6570960	6572720	sort of like
6572720	6573680	What is my role?
6573680	6577120	My role is to sort of write the buck on how to do this, right?
6577360	6580720	Which will I hope help it become more possible
6581120	6587680	You courtesy arvin. That's your courtesy arvin. You know, my role is definitely not to be king of a possible pick of monarchy
6587680	6592960	I'm a terrible. Sorry about that. I'm a terrible ceo. I've been a ceo. I'm awful at it. You really don't
6595040	6599280	But i'm a more of a the priest type than the within the warrior type but
6600480	6606080	But yeah, I mean like having that blueprint certainly helps or should help a great deal
6607120	6609120	To make it possible. But yeah
6609360	6611360	the political formulation
6611520	6613520	the pre pre formulation
6613760	6616640	Yeah, the you know the like why would you
6617840	6619840	Yeah, the sort of the
6620240	6624240	You have to have something both that is a plan that could be followed
6624880	6626960	and a plan that people can believe in
6627760	6629200	and
6629200	6633360	You know and that that belief is going to strike people is extremely on but like
6633920	6639920	America is the land of propagandizing on beliefs and you know, imagine, you know, sure
6640080	6642080	I mean imagine how like
