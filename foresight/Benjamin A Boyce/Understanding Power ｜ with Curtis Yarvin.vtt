WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.640
One thing that you said during one I can't remember which one you said that you would you should write a science fiction novel

00:07.640 --> 00:12.920
But you you don't want to write fiction. You don't think that you're good. I'm not I'm not I'm not a good fiction writer

00:12.920 --> 00:14.920
Yeah, but I was thinking and

00:16.200 --> 00:23.160
Like in the style of fadress or a meal or like some sort of dialogue where you're talking to you're talking to the student

00:23.160 --> 00:25.160
You know cuz I yeah

00:25.280 --> 00:27.280
There's I mean

00:27.400 --> 00:33.080
Sure go on go on well you talk about like one of your big ideas is this this monarch

00:33.560 --> 00:39.600
But I don't I don't get a sense of who that monarch would be like what it would his character be like you talk about the system

00:39.600 --> 00:46.080
But I wonder like if you get a bad guy in the system. How do you know like from your perspective like what virtues?

00:46.640 --> 00:52.080
this this yeah, I mean I think I think people try to sort of

00:53.760 --> 00:55.760
There's a lot of

00:56.040 --> 00:59.000
Fear there and people try to sort of overplay

01:00.160 --> 01:04.000
People sort of overplay the problem which is like somewhat

01:05.240 --> 01:07.560
banal in my view

01:07.560 --> 01:10.040
I mean, you know one way to think about it is

01:10.560 --> 01:17.040
If you look at the fortune 500 companies, right? There's 500 of them because that's why it's the fortune 500

01:17.640 --> 01:19.040
and

01:19.040 --> 01:24.840
You know the smallest of them has certainly thousands of employees

01:25.760 --> 01:27.760
And so you've got

01:28.280 --> 01:30.280
Sort of 500 men and women

01:31.400 --> 01:35.720
From that world who are experienced in holding that kind of

01:36.440 --> 01:41.200
Responsibility and if you look at their sets of like virtues and vices

01:42.000 --> 01:45.640
they're probably mostly pretty similar and

01:47.120 --> 01:48.600
You know

01:48.600 --> 01:53.760
Some of the ways I sort of regard people's kind of fear of monarchy is

01:54.760 --> 01:56.640
They sort of

01:56.640 --> 02:03.960
Imagine you're picking the CEO of Chipotle, right? And you're like first great priority is he's not gonna run

02:05.160 --> 02:08.400
Come up and with an evil scheme to like poison the burritos

02:08.920 --> 02:15.360
Because clearly he's the CEO so he could order poison put in the burritos could be a slow acting poison

02:16.000 --> 02:18.960
something right and and it's like the the

02:20.400 --> 02:22.400
executive search team when

02:23.240 --> 02:26.000
They pick the Chipotle CEO

02:27.320 --> 02:31.960
Does not really worry about we got to find someone who's not gonna poison the burritos and

02:33.080 --> 02:37.920
So like, you know, your bar is just a good bit higher than that

02:37.920 --> 02:46.320
And so, you know, I don't know who the CEO Chipotle is. He's probably fine. He's probably I mean, I guess, you know, the thing is that

02:46.600 --> 02:48.600
There are

02:49.280 --> 02:55.680
One of the ways people talk about the job in Silicon Valley is to describe the two kinds of CEOs

02:56.040 --> 03:02.360
Sort of people will say wartime CEOs and peacetime CEOs. That doesn't mean these companies are actually making war

03:02.360 --> 03:06.600
It just means that a peacetime CEO as a CEO who's

03:07.480 --> 03:13.360
Basically has something that's executing on a smooth keel and kind of needs to keep it forward

03:13.720 --> 03:20.840
Moving forward and executing sort of smoothly. So if you look like in terms of Apple say Steve Jobs is as a wartime CEO

03:20.840 --> 03:23.960
And Tim Cook is more of a peacetime CEO, right?

03:23.960 --> 03:30.360
Which is not to say that he's not making tough decisions or tough choices every day, but he's not really

03:31.080 --> 03:39.160
You know someone that you would want in there if their mission was to like entirely change what Apple is and so

03:39.760 --> 03:46.000
To a certain extent when you're establishing any kind of a new regime, that's a kind of wartime

03:46.840 --> 03:48.560
situation and so

03:48.560 --> 03:54.440
You need someone that's a very very dynamic. That's willing to like rip up a lot of pieces of paper

03:55.040 --> 03:58.920
and like a no say or a naysayer like somebody

03:58.960 --> 04:05.640
Yeah, like or yeah, I mean, but even even you know, I would you call even must Elon Musk

04:05.680 --> 04:12.680
You know a naysayer, you know, Elon Musk is someone with a lot of initiative who basically can make things happen and

04:13.560 --> 04:19.640
You know the role of a peacetime CEO is sort of more to like preside over something that's working

04:20.000 --> 04:25.880
Smoothly, which is why if you put someone like that in a position where large changes need to be made

04:25.880 --> 04:27.880
You don't really have the right person

04:29.400 --> 04:33.520
But you know the thing is that it's just not like we sort of

04:34.400 --> 04:40.840
A company the job with this like mystical air in some ways and it's actually

04:41.560 --> 04:48.080
It's a you know governing is or should be a pretty banal thing

04:48.680 --> 04:51.800
It's like it's gotten sort of a lot of like

04:52.680 --> 04:54.680
you know

04:56.280 --> 05:01.520
Very big romantic ideas associated with it and there's a lot of power there

05:01.600 --> 05:06.680
There's there's a lot of power there, but but the thing is that you know when when you

05:07.760 --> 05:09.760
when you have

05:10.400 --> 05:12.240
mechanisms for

05:12.240 --> 05:16.680
putting someone in that power that basically sort of

05:18.040 --> 05:20.040
depend on

05:21.800 --> 05:23.800
Like a kind of

05:26.080 --> 05:30.080
Certain like if the sort of the main

05:32.520 --> 05:36.200
Problem with a lot of the

05:38.840 --> 05:46.760
A lot of 20th century governance has a very high crazy level and when you look at basically the very high crazy level of

05:47.200 --> 05:50.360
20th century governance you basically see that

05:51.240 --> 05:53.240
There are crazy incentives

05:54.600 --> 06:01.280
Driving the way that people both get to make these decisions and crazy incentives driving them

06:01.520 --> 06:04.000
when they're making these decisions and

06:05.360 --> 06:09.480
Normally, it's best to see like the

06:11.000 --> 06:15.440
People who wind up in those slots as kind of

06:16.520 --> 06:21.920
Their craziness is in general constructed by those processes or those

06:22.920 --> 06:31.040
You know sort of like their hands are sort of tie. Yeah, the climate or the structure their hands are sort of tied in terms of

06:31.880 --> 06:37.000
how saying they can be and I think that people think of like

06:37.880 --> 06:39.880
sort of

06:40.240 --> 06:43.200
Like people have been exposed to so many

06:44.480 --> 06:47.440
Romantic ideas of governance that they don't

06:48.320 --> 06:52.080
Really even have an idea of what sanity is

06:52.080 --> 07:00.080
I mean, what is sanity for example for the CEO for an organization like Tesla for an organization like Ford?

07:01.080 --> 07:06.280
There's a whole bunch of constraints that sort of immediately tie you

07:06.960 --> 07:10.560
To a vision of the same, you know Tesla is not gonna go out

07:11.360 --> 07:12.960
and

07:12.960 --> 07:15.440
Invade the island of Haiti and like, you know

07:16.040 --> 07:20.960
Re-enslave the Haitians and set them to making sugarcane. It's just not that is not going to happen

07:20.960 --> 07:26.080
That is not within the realm of like saying things that Tesla could do Tesla is not going to say

07:26.680 --> 07:29.240
Tomorrow we're gonna take over the dental floss business

07:29.240 --> 07:33.880
We're gonna become the kings of dental floss like they're not gonna do this and and so

07:34.560 --> 07:37.440
when you're in sort of like a

07:40.080 --> 07:49.440
System and a structure that defines what sanity is whether you're Elon Musk or Elizabeth the first or Louis the 14th

07:51.440 --> 07:55.000
You have like it's sort of

07:56.120 --> 08:02.720
It feels like this much less sort of open-ended kind of crazy problem of like

08:02.720 --> 08:10.360
Oh, we're gonna go crazy and invade the moon or like, you know, and and there's there's like there's a lot of things that

08:11.560 --> 08:16.240
Washington does every day that are as crazy as invading the moon and when you look at the way

08:16.760 --> 08:18.760
Those crazy things happen

08:18.760 --> 08:26.040
It's not because of one or two crazy people actually generally the people involved in these things are like very

08:26.080 --> 08:28.080
sensible and very good and very

08:29.920 --> 08:31.920
You know

08:31.960 --> 08:34.200
Yeah, practical down-to-earth people

08:35.120 --> 08:41.240
Team players, you know, they're just basically in a system that makes them make, you know, crazy decisions

08:41.240 --> 08:47.480
I mean for me the COVID thing because I'm a you know, believer in the in the lab leak theory of COVID is

08:47.720 --> 08:50.400
such a perfect sort of case of like

08:51.040 --> 08:57.320
We're gonna have these crazy incentives that basically leave us doing this extremely dangerous

08:57.320 --> 09:01.360
gain-of-function research in this very very risky and unsafe way and

09:02.440 --> 09:04.440
the

09:05.560 --> 09:10.640
Because there's the government has taken on too much problems like with the company like Tesla

09:10.640 --> 09:17.920
They have a very specific mandate and with the government. It's so open-ended. Is that where the craziness or the stochastic chaos is coming?

09:17.920 --> 09:21.520
That's giving rise to these crazy ideas and behaviors. The the

09:23.800 --> 09:25.800
Like

09:28.560 --> 09:30.560
I mean, you know

09:30.560 --> 09:37.640
Even the question of what the mission of government is which seemed very obvious and very straight-forward

09:38.160 --> 09:41.320
Sadie the Elizabethans has taken on all this sort of

09:42.040 --> 09:45.120
Chili-astic and messianic kind of you know overtones

09:45.720 --> 09:48.840
I mean even when you look at for example

09:49.600 --> 09:51.600
when you dive into

09:51.960 --> 09:56.240
Say a question like foreign policy, it's sort of dubious as to whether

09:57.000 --> 10:03.120
There's sort of ever been any clear sanity guiding us foreign policy

10:03.120 --> 10:07.880
I mean if you go and look for example at Washington's farewell address

10:09.040 --> 10:11.040
Which you predict, you know the farewell address

10:11.800 --> 10:13.800
I

10:18.080 --> 10:20.400
Could but I'll just I'll just summarize it

10:20.400 --> 10:28.280
You know his farewell address is sort of he's like reminding Americans that their foreign policy should be conducted in the you know

10:28.280 --> 10:31.520
The interests of America and it's that he's expressing

10:31.680 --> 10:37.800
it's it's one of the expressions of kind of what is sometimes called isolationist foreign policy and

10:38.600 --> 10:40.600
he's basically

10:40.640 --> 10:47.880
Sort of painting this picture very 18th century picture of a kind of wise approach to foreign policy and

10:48.960 --> 10:53.000
You know, this is all very well, but you sort of read it and you're like

10:54.560 --> 11:00.840
Why do you have to say this and the reason he had to say this and warned against basically

11:01.720 --> 11:03.360
sort of

11:03.360 --> 11:04.320
being

11:04.320 --> 11:06.560
pulled into the quarrels of others and

11:06.800 --> 11:08.800
Is that already?

11:08.960 --> 11:15.160
Basically many Americans including the Americans who didn't really disagree didn't really agree with George Washington too much

11:15.360 --> 11:24.040
We're very very eager to basically see the United States become the kind of world home base of revolutionary politics

11:24.040 --> 11:30.680
And so right away you had this, you know, we've always been dreamers then or at least there

11:30.680 --> 11:40.120
You had this incredibly wacky event with this guy's citizen Jenae who was the the French Revolutionary Ambassador to the US and basically

11:41.320 --> 11:48.640
Made him made such a news made himself such a nuisance that he actually got kicked out was but was basically sort of proceeding on this plan and

11:49.080 --> 11:52.280
The level of like support for the French Revolution

11:53.320 --> 11:55.320
Even as sort of at its most

11:55.320 --> 11:57.040
Sanguinary days

11:57.080 --> 12:01.760
Was you know, you'll have all these lines from Jefferson where he's like the tree of you know

12:01.760 --> 12:06.080
The tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of tyrants or like shit like that

12:06.080 --> 12:13.280
You know where he's basically like, you know, he's like, ah, you know, he reacts to this insane shit in France where he's been

12:13.280 --> 12:18.320
right by you got to kill a few people everyone's alright, you know, it's kind of creepy, right, you know and and

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
distinctly

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
reminiscent of

12:23.000 --> 12:27.560
American sympathy for Stalin or for, you know, the Russian Revolution

12:28.400 --> 12:31.120
I mean in 1848 there's this

12:31.640 --> 12:39.160
Of course outright, you know sort of outbreak of almost what we would now call color revolutions across Europe and

12:41.120 --> 12:46.320
This one character in Hungary this guy to soothe becomes the liberal leader of Hungary

12:46.960 --> 12:52.840
Is then chased out by, you know, the Russian Russian troops help the Habsburgs reinstall themselves

12:53.360 --> 13:01.440
Kuthu Kuthuth gets chased out and he becomes this massive public celebrity first in London and then in America

13:01.800 --> 13:10.600
Where basically people are doing exactly the same thing with sort of the Hungarians in 1848 that they're doing say with the Ukrainians now

13:10.600 --> 13:16.880
They're basically found, you know, they're sort of doing exactly what Washington was telling them not to do

13:16.880 --> 13:23.800
They basically found the sort of foreign quarrel developed an emotionally interested and picked a side and

13:24.720 --> 13:26.160
like, you know

13:26.160 --> 13:27.520
gone

13:27.520 --> 13:31.760
bananas over it. Do you think that has something to do with our culture then that we like to

13:32.080 --> 13:36.320
Kind of embosom the world or we find a conflict that doesn't necessarily have to do with us

13:36.360 --> 13:38.360
We just identify with that

13:41.320 --> 13:43.320
Yeah, it's like a sick

13:43.400 --> 13:49.960
Laticatorial, you know reflex. It's like if you remember the Arab Spring, right? You were probably excited about the Arab Spring

13:50.200 --> 13:55.800
That was the bipartisan, you know, excitement. Everyone was excited about the Arab Spring and that's cool

13:55.800 --> 14:01.600
The internet was doing it making waves, you know, Twitter. Yeah, I know I know I know I know and and this is like yeah

14:01.600 --> 14:04.840
Twitter and Facebook were and you remember like Google guy in Egypt, right?

14:04.840 --> 14:09.560
You know and that movement wind up killing about 500,000 to a million people

14:09.560 --> 14:14.760
It did not cause the Civil War in Egypt, which it almost did which certainly would have killed a few more million people

14:15.400 --> 14:17.880
It devastated Syria and Libya

14:18.800 --> 14:24.920
And it was like it was sort of funny watching, you know, sort of the American

14:26.800 --> 14:30.320
Democratic governance machine in a situation where

14:31.000 --> 14:37.800
Public opinion and the deep state are really sort of completely aligned and we feel that we're doing this very clearly

14:38.480 --> 14:40.400
unambiguously good thing

14:40.400 --> 14:43.080
and then it just results in just like

14:43.520 --> 14:45.880
horror and disaster as usual and

14:46.800 --> 14:48.800
the

14:49.040 --> 14:51.040
The response of people

14:52.400 --> 14:58.000
There's sort of one test I use for like sanity in that situation

14:58.400 --> 15:06.560
Which is kind of a good Samaritan test and if you're really acting as a as a good Samaritan in this case, let's say you

15:08.080 --> 15:11.720
You're walking down the street and you see your horrific motorcycle accident

15:11.720 --> 15:19.400
And you're the first one on this scene you run over to the guy. He's lying there in his motorcycle helmet. You like take his helmet off

15:21.240 --> 15:23.240
Don't do that you made a mistake

15:23.240 --> 15:29.200
Do not move the helmet of someone who's had a motorcycle accident because it turns out that you just broke his neck

15:29.200 --> 15:35.040
And or he broke his neck, but you broke his spinal cord and paralyzed him for life. Let the MTS handle that one

15:35.040 --> 15:37.360
Right, but you didn't right? You were trying to be nice

15:37.360 --> 15:40.160
You were trying to help but you basically just inflicted this

15:40.800 --> 15:43.680
Horridous life-changing thing on these people, right?

15:43.680 --> 15:50.760
And so if you're basically doing that with the sort of the true spirit of charity and altruism

15:51.360 --> 15:56.520
You're gonna be pretty beaten up about that. You're gonna think hard about wow

15:56.520 --> 16:02.520
I was trying to help but instead I inflicted this crazy level of damage and

16:04.200 --> 16:06.560
You would definitely never do something like that again and

16:08.400 --> 16:15.360
But we don't as a country we work but with Arab Spring it was like, oh, this didn't work out. It's too bad

16:15.360 --> 16:19.760
Let's change the channel, right? You know and so there's this sense of like

16:20.360 --> 16:22.360
sort of

16:23.600 --> 16:32.680
Deranged and irresponsible like power in a sense running free, you know, it's like when you compare say Libya

16:33.960 --> 16:36.960
or the Libyan revolutionaries in

16:37.920 --> 16:39.920
2012 or whenever it was to

16:40.760 --> 16:49.000
sort of foreign policy of the past the thing that it instantly reminds you of is say the Spanish-American war or

16:49.760 --> 16:53.720
Say the reunification of Italy by Garibaldi

16:54.640 --> 16:58.920
Garibaldi certainly reunified Italy with his like 300 red shirts or whatever

16:58.920 --> 17:00.080
but

17:00.080 --> 17:04.120
That was a reconquer the kingdom of the two Sicilies with this 300 red shirts

17:04.120 --> 17:09.560
Which was possible only because he had the British Navy right offshore declaring basically a no-sale zone

17:10.880 --> 17:14.880
Whatever the equivalent was at the time, right? So it was this sort of act of

17:16.040 --> 17:18.040
kind of somewhat naked

17:18.760 --> 17:26.280
Imperialism and the result was a new unified Italy which was to some extent a British client state

17:26.440 --> 17:32.760
Which offered a lot of new commercial opportunities to British merchants. You look at the Spanish-American war

17:32.800 --> 17:40.720
It has all of these like, you know all this liberal rhetoric about how you know in the yellow press about how you know

17:40.720 --> 17:45.920
The evil Spanish generals are abusing, you know fetching Cupid maidens and so forth

17:45.920 --> 17:54.280
They really laid it on extremely thick and and like just like at a level of like blatancy. That's just utterly comical today

17:55.800 --> 17:57.800
But on the other hand

17:58.480 --> 18:04.960
So it was sort of this kind of high point of like liberal imperialism or like an attack on a foreign power

18:04.960 --> 18:09.840
That was basically justified by sort of liberal thinking on the other hand

18:09.840 --> 18:14.880
This liberal thinking resulted in basically the acquisition of Cuba the Philippines and Puerto Rico

18:15.320 --> 18:23.160
Say what you want about Puerto Rico, but these are valuable properties basically and we're treated as valuable properties and

18:23.640 --> 18:30.400
Returned much to like American colonialist investors and the United Fruit Company and so on and so forth

18:30.400 --> 18:36.240
And so you basically look at that sort of liberal imperialism and you're like, okay

18:37.040 --> 18:39.680
There's something predatory here clearly

18:39.960 --> 18:47.840
You know from the perspective of Spain there's something very predatory going on here on the other hand like

18:48.880 --> 18:50.200
What?

18:50.200 --> 18:54.280
the US in 1898 killed it ate and

18:55.280 --> 19:00.240
So it was like a dog like there's something ugly about it and there's something beautiful about it

19:00.240 --> 19:04.800
It's like a wolf hunting a deer, you know, like, you know, this is only gonna end one way

19:04.800 --> 19:08.480
You know, the wolf was gonna take down the deer and then the wolf was gonna eat, right?

19:08.480 --> 19:13.040
And the thing is when you look at sort of the liberal imperialism of today

19:13.880 --> 19:15.400
It's like

19:15.400 --> 19:17.400
It's like a dog killing sheep

19:17.440 --> 19:23.320
Like there's an instinct to like take out Gaddafi. There's an instinct to take out Assad

19:23.320 --> 19:28.520
It feels great to have wheeled Obama and put it something on his teleprompter where he's like Assad must go

19:28.520 --> 19:30.520
Boba bark must go Gaddafi must go

19:31.520 --> 19:40.000
People understate the sort of power of American self-power to the point where if you will to bomb it out and had him say like

19:40.000 --> 19:43.080
Merkel must go you could probably start a civil war in Germany that way

19:49.000 --> 19:56.280
Just by just by basically saying we remove the moral authority from this regime that we have established and

19:56.880 --> 20:02.400
If you basically yeah, I mean you could you know amazing things are possible with that shit

20:04.040 --> 20:06.040
But

20:06.680 --> 20:13.880
This liberal retric or this this liberal facade of generosity of caring is always hiding some sort of power play

20:13.880 --> 20:20.920
Or you can't separate those two would it be better to just like it's like can't it can't it's an interesting question

20:21.080 --> 20:23.080
It's like it's hiding

20:23.200 --> 20:27.680
It's not really an absence of

20:28.840 --> 20:36.040
Sincerity it's that it's sort of it's a thing that the sincerity kind of doesn't know itself

20:36.040 --> 20:41.880
And so people think that they're genuinely sincere that what they're sort of doing is

20:44.160 --> 20:50.160
Caring but what's actually sort of driving them and driving the structures there is

20:50.640 --> 20:56.840
Something where when the effects of the caring are extremely bad and counterproductive

20:57.280 --> 20:58.880
There's no caring about that

20:58.880 --> 21:05.520
So in a way, it's like it's something that really wants to think of itself as kind of a duty of care

21:05.920 --> 21:11.160
but you can also read it as this like perverse gladiatorial fascination and

21:12.080 --> 21:14.080
You know this thing of like

21:14.400 --> 21:19.280
We're using Ukraine to weaken Putin and we're gonna like fight to the last Ukrainian

21:19.280 --> 21:22.960
I mean, it's like if you think you're doing a good thing for Ukraine

21:23.520 --> 21:29.120
Excuse me the Ukraine here. If you think you're doing a good thing for the Ukraine you're already

21:30.960 --> 21:32.960
Several hundred yards

21:33.680 --> 21:35.680
Behind the goal line here

21:35.840 --> 21:41.520
Like many bad things have already happened to Ukraine the Ukraine as a result of this policy

21:42.080 --> 21:45.760
Of arming it to like basically as an anti-russian power

21:46.320 --> 21:51.520
So you might say we're gonna get the 300 yards back and we're gonna get back to our own 20

21:51.920 --> 21:58.160
But you've got you're you're not even in the stadium right now in terms of the damage you've inflicted on this country

21:58.640 --> 22:00.400
and

22:00.400 --> 22:05.840
You would say well the Ukrainians are into it. Well, yeah, I mean like

22:06.800 --> 22:10.560
The Jedi mind powers of like the american

22:11.600 --> 22:13.600
cosmopolitan ruling class

22:13.840 --> 22:15.840
Are extremely great

22:15.840 --> 22:17.040
and

22:17.040 --> 22:19.600
If we went past sort of our current

22:20.320 --> 22:22.000
Enthusiasm's into like

22:22.000 --> 22:24.880
Some kind of full-on jim jones suicide cult

22:25.760 --> 22:28.240
I feel like a lot of the chic people in

22:28.880 --> 22:32.400
Warsaw and Kiev and levove would be committing suicide as well

22:33.600 --> 22:38.880
I think that's sort of how powerful that kind of fashion dominance is in a way and so

22:39.520 --> 22:41.840
and that was certainly the case with the

22:42.560 --> 22:44.000
kind of

22:44.000 --> 22:46.640
tiny fringes of sort of liberal elite who

22:47.520 --> 22:55.680
Were very into the arab spring. Also. It's like wow civil society in libya or civil civil society in egypt is going to get a huge boost

22:56.240 --> 23:00.160
Um, and they didn't but you could see where they were sort of coming from

23:00.880 --> 23:02.880
with that and so

23:03.040 --> 23:05.040
that we just like with

23:06.080 --> 23:08.080
I don't know. I don't want to get into european

23:08.480 --> 23:11.680
History or something, but I'm just thinking we inflict that on ourselves through

23:12.320 --> 23:13.760
Wokeness or dei training

23:13.760 --> 23:16.640
It seems like with the black lives matter event like the liberal

23:17.360 --> 23:21.440
Cosmopolitan elite was all on board with defunding the police. We're going to liberate these

23:22.240 --> 23:28.160
These these areas of our own country and now those areas are completely decimated by yeah, all of them

23:28.160 --> 23:35.200
Well, I mean, yeah, I mean it wasn't rhetoric doesn't actually translate into hoping it wasn't I mean it wasn't the first time

23:35.360 --> 23:37.360
I mean if you look at

23:37.680 --> 23:39.680
basically

23:39.920 --> 23:41.520
60 years ago

23:41.520 --> 23:43.520
Every major american city

23:44.000 --> 23:50.560
Had like a thriving black business district. It had a thriving black upper class residential district

23:52.080 --> 23:55.440
You know in those areas of general are burned out now and that was basically

23:56.160 --> 23:59.200
something that happened in the late 60s and early 70s

23:59.920 --> 24:01.040
and

24:01.040 --> 24:03.040
You know the connection between

24:03.680 --> 24:05.360
that and

24:05.360 --> 24:07.360
the civil rights movement which

24:08.160 --> 24:13.680
Americans saw on their TVs and supported with great enthusiasm seems to be sort of rather

24:14.800 --> 24:16.800
Direct in a way

24:17.520 --> 24:19.520
And so you're basically

24:20.640 --> 24:22.080
again

24:22.080 --> 24:24.800
Looking at something where if you're like

24:25.600 --> 24:26.720
Wow

24:26.720 --> 24:31.440
Let's say i'm like flying a drone over urban african-american areas

24:32.080 --> 24:39.680
In like 1962 and 2022 what i'm going to observe with my eyes is that these areas have been like

24:40.320 --> 24:44.480
decimated and so I would basically assume that

24:45.760 --> 24:50.560
Sometime in the 60s some kind of radical anti-black party had come to power

24:50.960 --> 24:59.040
Maybe the klu Klux Klan had won the election in 68 and that would explain why these areas had been systematically destroyed

24:59.520 --> 25:07.040
Right and that's not indeed what happened. You know what happened was actually the opposite of that what happened was that

25:07.680 --> 25:09.440
basically

25:09.440 --> 25:14.560
A set an aspect of america that hadn't gotten a whole lot of attention or sympathy

25:15.280 --> 25:18.320
Or this or you know empathy you might say

25:19.360 --> 25:23.440
Receive that and the result of this emotion was

25:24.480 --> 25:26.480
seemed to be and you know

25:27.040 --> 25:28.960
just to

25:29.120 --> 25:32.800
A physical observer of the people in the places

25:33.760 --> 25:36.000
Seems to be a great deal of destruction

25:36.960 --> 25:37.840
and

25:37.840 --> 25:39.840
the mentality of

25:40.000 --> 25:45.440
Like our intentions are good our hearts are pure and so we don't really have to think about

25:46.320 --> 25:50.160
The destruction that we're causing or the destruction that results here

25:51.040 --> 25:53.040
is not

25:53.040 --> 25:56.240
The way that people whose hearts are pure think

25:57.200 --> 26:03.040
And so at no point under any of these examples to the people who are taking off the bike helmet

26:03.280 --> 26:08.480
Actually have to deal with the severed spine or recognize that they're at fault for doing that

26:08.560 --> 26:11.680
It doesn't seem yes. That's capable or the system itself

26:12.320 --> 26:13.520
There are the liberal

26:13.520 --> 26:19.840
There's culture just can't see they're they're they're motivated by like there's something that

26:20.960 --> 26:22.960
is very similar

26:23.520 --> 26:26.080
to empathy and sort of easily

26:26.960 --> 26:34.320
Masquerades as it but like drives out the real thing. It's like a kind of gresham's law where bad money drives out good

26:34.800 --> 26:36.800
bad empathy drives out good empathy

26:38.080 --> 26:45.360
And so, you know, one of the ways to think about well, you know, you're like, what is this bad empathy?

26:45.360 --> 26:47.360
What is this thing that

26:47.440 --> 26:50.080
is like empathy, but is not empathy and

26:50.080 --> 26:57.520
It reminds me of this etymological fact that I love that I always quote, which is the etymology of the word lord

26:59.120 --> 27:02.880
Lord is an old anglo-saxon word and it comes from

27:03.520 --> 27:05.280
cloth ward

27:05.280 --> 27:07.280
Which means the cloth is

27:08.720 --> 27:09.920
loaf

27:09.920 --> 27:11.600
as in bread

27:11.600 --> 27:19.920
And the ward is ward is in guard as in basically so your lord is basically he who guards your bread

27:20.080 --> 27:23.120
he who gives you this day your daily bread and

27:24.640 --> 27:27.760
If you're feeding someone you basically are his lord

27:28.240 --> 27:31.440
because even if you don't care to tell him what to do you could

27:32.160 --> 27:35.680
And you could say if you don't do this, I'm not gonna feed you

27:36.240 --> 27:41.760
and so the sort of, you know, basically the sense that you have of like

27:42.480 --> 27:47.360
Caring for others is like closely entwined with the sense

27:47.920 --> 27:49.920
of being lord over them

27:50.960 --> 27:51.920
and

27:51.920 --> 27:58.320
You know, certainly as a parent like you feel that very closely like the the sort of the care and the dependency

27:58.960 --> 28:01.200
Are all very much tied together

28:01.920 --> 28:03.120
and so

28:03.120 --> 28:06.240
in a way when people adopt these sort of, you know

28:07.120 --> 28:12.240
The mindset that supports these kinds of foreign policies, they sort of

28:13.040 --> 28:17.440
Acquiring or domestic policies. They're sort of acquiring clients in a way

28:17.520 --> 28:20.480
They're sort of feeling themselves become more powerful

28:20.960 --> 28:24.640
Because they're feeling themselves owning others by caring for others

28:25.040 --> 28:26.720
it's it's actually

28:26.720 --> 28:27.760
it's

28:27.760 --> 28:33.280
represented on twitter the people who put ukraine flags in their bio are kind of claiming ukraine as their own in a way

28:33.440 --> 28:38.800
They're claiming ukraine as absolutely. They're claiming ukraine as their as their position and they don't really understand

28:39.360 --> 28:43.440
Yeah, as their vassal state, right, you know, and they sort of don't understand like

28:44.160 --> 28:47.040
because they've sort of only been exposed to

28:48.240 --> 28:50.240
Imperialism as a caricature

28:50.960 --> 28:54.880
They don't really understand how close this is to

28:56.080 --> 28:58.880
The way that actual imperialists thought

28:59.760 --> 29:05.600
And so yeah, white man's burden kind of classic. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah white man's burden, right? And so basically

29:06.240 --> 29:08.240
you know, they're they're taking up the

29:09.200 --> 29:13.280
You know, the the the white man's burden when they put the ukraine flag in their

29:14.320 --> 29:18.320
In their thing, I mean, you know, of course raises the question of whether slobs are white

29:18.480 --> 29:20.640
But um, you know, we don't we don't have to go into that

29:21.040 --> 29:24.880
Add the mulligy of slave if you want to hey, there you go. There you go. Right, right, right, right?

29:25.200 --> 29:29.120
And now it's like they wear these track suits. They have this like squat, you know the

29:29.920 --> 29:37.040
I mean, you know, I don't know if you know that like some of the rhetoric, you know, the sort of ukrainian russian rhetoric is absolutely

29:38.000 --> 29:43.040
Deranged and the word more deranged than our blue red rhetoric

29:43.680 --> 29:48.080
Yes, because the slur that ukrainians have picked up on that they

29:49.680 --> 29:51.680
Used for russian is orcs

29:51.680 --> 29:53.840
Literally orcs. They stole it from tolkin, right?

29:53.840 --> 29:57.520
And so they basically think of them as like subhuman creatures from the east

29:58.000 --> 30:03.200
And and one of the things that triggered the original revolt in the donbas in 2014

30:03.680 --> 30:09.040
Was basically as soon as the kind of western ukrainians got control of the ukrainian state

30:09.360 --> 30:12.400
They started passing all of these like anti russian laws

30:12.480 --> 30:17.280
Like you have to like not speak russian and like change your name to like the funny looking ukrainian spelling

30:17.680 --> 30:21.520
And you'll see pictures on yes, so they did a cultural genocide

30:22.480 --> 30:24.480
Yeah, that's a strong genocide

30:25.200 --> 30:32.400
It's basically yeah, it's the sort of thing that basically you do to a cultural, you know minority that you basically want to kind of

30:33.200 --> 30:37.040
You know bring into line, you know, you could compare it if you were feeling generous to like the way

30:37.520 --> 30:45.680
That like northern france treated southern france like 500 600 years ago, right, you know, and and and it's like the

30:48.240 --> 30:54.080
And and so you'll see pictures one of the old folk punishments or whatever which gets used a lot

30:55.200 --> 30:57.760
In ukraine is tying people to trees

30:58.080 --> 31:02.800
And so I don't know if you go around you'll see in twitter people tied to trees or telephone poles

31:02.800 --> 31:07.360
And sometimes their faces have been painted green to show that there are orcs

31:08.000 --> 31:10.480
Um, this would be like I don't think that like

31:11.120 --> 31:16.080
Speaking russian is not going to do that but like basically you're being accused of being a russian sympathizer

31:16.480 --> 31:23.200
So it's just this like, you know, you go into like the inside of this war and there's just like insane shit everywhere, right?

31:23.280 --> 31:29.920
You know and and needless to say the people with ukrainian flags in their in their twitter handles

31:30.400 --> 31:34.640
Would probably never tie anyone to a tree and paint their face green for speaking the wrong language

31:35.040 --> 31:39.360
But like that that was probably not really in their like bag of tricks

31:39.680 --> 31:43.200
Like at all really but like that's sort of what they're

31:44.080 --> 31:50.240
When they basically sort of picked sides in this like nationalistic Balkan basically fight

31:50.240 --> 31:54.320
I'm sure all all ukrainians would be insulted by my use of the word Balkan

31:54.320 --> 31:58.880
But you know the the like, you know, you're just doing this like

31:59.520 --> 32:01.520
There's this level at what

32:02.560 --> 32:04.960
Where what you're doing is this kind of

32:06.080 --> 32:12.400
Gladiatorial spectator thing and like to like sort of step sort of all the way

32:13.280 --> 32:15.280
back, right

32:15.680 --> 32:17.680
It's like when

32:18.640 --> 32:26.720
You know, you look at the foreign policy that's driven this where you know, there were these constant promises made to like not expand NATO

32:26.720 --> 32:32.080
And then it's like, oops. Sorry. It looks like we're expanding NATO, right, you know and the

32:33.440 --> 32:36.320
like the sense of

32:38.640 --> 32:43.040
A driving force behind this kind of foreign policy

32:43.200 --> 32:47.440
Which is not in any way the force of reason

32:48.720 --> 32:54.160
Is like you're just like it's sort of it's just like power is flowing

32:54.960 --> 32:58.320
Into wherever it wants to go and it's sort of reminiscent

32:58.720 --> 33:03.760
There's a lot of this kind of foreign policy that's like very reminiscent of the frog in the scorpion, right?

33:04.000 --> 33:06.960
where basically it's just sort of

33:07.920 --> 33:12.880
The nature of this whole system, which includes both the

33:13.680 --> 33:17.920
bureaucrats who run it and the sort of supporters of it who basically like

33:18.640 --> 33:23.760
Have these incentives to basically cause trouble and create problems

33:24.240 --> 33:28.880
And they don't see it that way. That is not their framework. They're basically

33:29.920 --> 33:36.480
Trying to like create freedom, but their sense of freedom is basically they see one stone on top of another

33:37.120 --> 33:39.680
And they're like we must liberate the stone on the bottom

33:40.080 --> 33:43.600
And so, you know, sort of freedom is kind of becomes

33:44.880 --> 33:46.640
indistinguishable from

33:46.640 --> 33:48.960
a kind of like destruction and so

33:49.920 --> 33:53.680
You look at basically the like things that

33:54.400 --> 33:56.000
like

33:56.000 --> 33:59.600
When you compare for example, afghanistan to vietnam

34:00.480 --> 34:02.480
you know, basically

34:03.200 --> 34:04.400
The

34:04.400 --> 34:08.000
first of all afghanistan is run by people who's like

34:08.960 --> 34:12.560
Formative experience was the lessons learned from vietnam

34:13.440 --> 34:18.720
And just in terms of like age cohort. They didn't seem to learn any lesson at all and like

34:19.680 --> 34:21.600
vietnam

34:21.600 --> 34:24.320
afghanistan makes vietnam looks sane and

34:25.920 --> 34:31.680
Like it made vietnam looks sane. It was just like all of us. We're never gonna get the you know full metal jacket movies

34:31.760 --> 34:36.240
It's never gonna be romanticized or yeah. Yeah, and and there's no like, you know

34:36.400 --> 34:39.040
It's like when you look at sort of for example

34:39.200 --> 34:44.400
Like the reality of the south vietnamese government is like much realer than the afghan government

34:44.880 --> 34:46.880
Like the level of like, you know

34:47.840 --> 34:49.840
Sort of just like everything about

34:50.640 --> 34:57.280
Vietnam you can sort of find ways to look at the vietnam effort where you're like, okay, there's certain ways

34:58.080 --> 35:00.800
Ultimately in the end this didn't make sense and it didn't work

35:00.880 --> 35:02.800
But you can kind of see

35:02.800 --> 35:07.200
Here are things that made sense that like this was maybe like close to

35:07.680 --> 35:13.920
And you can't even find out for afghanistan and so you have just like all of these things whether it's like

35:15.040 --> 35:17.040
invading afghanistan and

35:17.120 --> 35:22.560
Trying to like, you know for 20 years. We're there for spending 20 years in this comical

35:23.200 --> 35:26.480
ridiculous ineffective attempt to turn it into vermont or something

35:27.920 --> 35:30.320
And maybe we would have been happy with florida

35:30.880 --> 35:34.240
Maybe we could have been happy. Maybe we could have been happy with oklahoma

35:34.480 --> 35:39.600
Maybe we could have been happy with guam, but no, you know, we needed we needed the vermont concept of you know

35:39.680 --> 35:44.160
The bennington concept of human rights, you know, and and and like and so, you know

35:44.160 --> 35:47.280
We had all these bennington grads going and teaching like, you know, very, you know

35:47.760 --> 35:49.760
In gender rights, whatever

35:50.640 --> 35:56.240
Poetry workshops, right, you know, exactly and and um nothing wrong with a good poetry workshop

35:56.320 --> 36:03.360
But you know like everything has its place and and the I mean they love they love I mean in the taliban actually writing

36:04.080 --> 36:10.560
Poems is like a qualification for leadership, right? But is it is it? It is it is it is a very good volume

36:10.560 --> 36:16.800
There's a yes, there's a volume of like translated taliban poetry. That's actually not too bad if you're into it's all of course

36:17.040 --> 36:19.600
From a taliban perspective, right? You know, it's not really

36:20.160 --> 36:22.160
Not really gonna appeal to the

36:23.120 --> 36:27.840
It's like there's this there's this other great book that i'm a huge fan of um called zen at war

36:28.240 --> 36:34.400
Which was written by like a california hippie zen dude like in the 80s or 90s or something where he realizes that

36:34.960 --> 36:40.400
All of these zen masters many of whom came over to like california because they smelled a good thing and like

36:40.960 --> 36:46.960
After you know the 40s 50s 60s, but in like the 30s and 40s these guys are in japan

36:47.760 --> 36:51.520
They're in imperial japan, right? So he's like what is zen like?

36:52.240 --> 36:53.280
um

36:53.280 --> 37:00.960
In imperial japan and he basically finds all these like and he just quotes these things with it's just the outrage where they're just like, you know

37:01.840 --> 37:09.280
The feeling of zen is the feeling of a chinese soldier's head trapping from his body as the perfect swords

37:09.440 --> 37:11.440
like i mean, right, you know

37:12.320 --> 37:17.040
And like, you know, there's just you know, nothing is more zen than the mom that are killing right, you know or

37:18.000 --> 37:19.440
and

37:19.440 --> 37:24.320
It just reminds you of the sort of protean nature of this religion which can be sort of like

37:24.880 --> 37:31.280
california hippies and and you know imperial desk wads, uh, you know equally well and and and

37:33.600 --> 37:37.680
I'm sure these zen and tally bone the tally bone. Yeah, right. And so yeah, there's definitely

37:37.760 --> 37:42.400
I mean there's something poetic and beautiful about martyrdom operations or whatever you want to call it

37:42.800 --> 37:45.120
Well, or you have to have a poetic sense of

37:45.600 --> 37:47.200
Reality in order to sure

37:47.200 --> 37:52.080
I mean, and you know, you listen you listen to isis videos. They're all like, you know, nashid's

37:52.560 --> 37:58.880
Which are um, you know acapella singing that, you know, uh, salafi islam's like, okay, you can have music

37:58.960 --> 38:03.280
But no instruments. Yeah, so you have these basically nashid's which are like

38:03.760 --> 38:07.040
Sort of the taliban al qaeda equivalent of like the narco corrido

38:07.120 --> 38:12.240
If you know that mexican genre like the drug drug narco music from northern mexico

38:12.720 --> 38:17.280
Like that celebrates like, you know, the the achievements of great drug lords

38:17.760 --> 38:22.640
Um, and they have that for basically martyrs and so forth. And I mean, it's it's beautiful

38:22.960 --> 38:26.800
Anyway, there's this very good volume with have translated taliban poetry, but um,

38:27.520 --> 38:31.920
Yeah, you know, definitely like feminist poetry workshops are not really the thing

38:32.000 --> 38:34.880
It's gonna turn kandahar into into bennington

38:35.440 --> 38:38.640
And and so you basically, you know, they had their chance, right?

38:38.720 --> 38:42.560
You know, if it was gonna work, it was gonna work. It probably would have worked by now

38:45.280 --> 38:48.960
And and so when we basically, um

38:50.400 --> 38:54.240
Kind of pull the camera back and we look at basically

38:54.880 --> 38:57.920
Just like the level of just weird

38:58.640 --> 39:00.480
insane shit

39:00.480 --> 39:06.320
That dc does that nobody even thinks about like how weird and insane it is

39:06.880 --> 39:14.000
You're at a like, you know, people will be like, well, the u.s. government's lorotic and, you know, slow and bumbling and bureaucratic

39:14.080 --> 39:19.120
But so is ibm. I'm like, yeah, okay. Yes. ibm is like this, but like

39:19.840 --> 39:25.760
Waters of magnitude my friends, like, you know, like and and so they're just like whole

39:26.880 --> 39:33.040
You know, it's like another great dc example is you remember 9 11 probably

39:33.760 --> 39:39.120
Looks like you were a little younger than me at that time. But um, they came up they came up with this

39:41.920 --> 39:44.960
You're you're looking good. Um, the um, um

39:45.760 --> 39:48.160
The the keeping that brown hair is very important

39:49.360 --> 39:54.640
He got great locks too. Yeah. Yeah, as soon as as soon as I start getting bald. That's all coming off

39:55.680 --> 40:00.240
But um, I will not be one of those people but you know, the um, it's good a good hat

40:01.200 --> 40:05.440
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, right. Um, but just like the

40:06.880 --> 40:09.040
the sheer

40:09.040 --> 40:11.040
like

40:11.440 --> 40:16.560
The will like the the sheer like the yeah, I mean the example I was thinking of is that

40:17.360 --> 40:21.040
So we have this term national security that was basically

40:21.840 --> 40:26.560
It's a world war two term and what was decided, you know, basically

40:26.720 --> 40:29.920
I think there's this line from roosevelt where he's basically like

40:31.280 --> 40:38.320
Any political events anywhere in the world are relevant to us national security. This is basically this isn't the second

40:38.400 --> 40:40.640
Yeah, this is this is franklin, right? And so

40:41.200 --> 40:44.800
basically it somehow came about that basically

40:46.160 --> 40:48.960
part of the american kind of political

40:50.080 --> 40:54.320
Creed became that to keep america safe. We have to rule the world

40:54.560 --> 40:59.520
But you say even washington even george washington had already noticed that that is our tendency

40:59.600 --> 41:04.320
There's something and exactly the way we look at the world is that there's something there's this sort of weird

41:04.880 --> 41:07.920
Yeah, there's this weird vicarious like hunger

41:08.560 --> 41:10.560
That basically becomes

41:11.280 --> 41:14.000
People really don't feel it as the will to dominate it

41:14.000 --> 41:17.680
But it becomes the will to dominate and then it's sort of that will to dominate

41:18.400 --> 41:23.520
Enter as all of these institutions and become sort of part of the unconscious

41:24.320 --> 41:26.320
Creed of these institutions

41:26.960 --> 41:29.760
And then the us is actually attacked in

41:30.880 --> 41:32.000
2001

41:32.000 --> 41:33.200
And so

41:33.200 --> 41:37.120
Then they have to come up with this term homeland security

41:38.480 --> 41:44.720
Which means national security but not national security because that word is already taken, right?

41:45.680 --> 41:50.960
And so they come up with this weird nazi sounding term homeland, right? You know homeland, right?

41:50.960 --> 41:52.640
At least it's genderless, right?

41:52.640 --> 41:54.160
At least it's genderless, right?

41:54.160 --> 41:55.440
You know haimath, right?

41:55.440 --> 42:03.760
You know and and it's just like it's it's and and you're like you would say national security except that word is already taken

42:04.160 --> 42:10.000
For meaning something which it doesn't mean, right? And so you have all these incredible like

42:11.040 --> 42:13.040
distortions of like

42:13.280 --> 42:17.040
There are all these convoluted ways of thinking that are sort of

42:17.920 --> 42:19.920
spread to the population

42:20.320 --> 42:21.360
from

42:21.360 --> 42:27.760
You know these assumptions that are hidden deep in our these assumptions that are sort of came out of some weird

42:28.400 --> 42:33.120
Historical structure that get embedded in everything. You know, it's sort of like the

42:35.120 --> 42:36.960
You know the

42:36.960 --> 42:42.720
I think people have traced like the six foot social disc both the six foot social distancing thing

42:43.280 --> 42:47.360
And the paper straw thing and people have been like where did this come from?

42:47.760 --> 42:50.480
And they actually found like high school science projects

42:51.040 --> 42:53.360
That were basically the source of this shit, right?

42:53.600 --> 42:56.000
You know and and like it doesn't matter anymore

42:56.000 --> 43:00.640
But you still have all you know all these circles on the floor where there's six feet social distancing thing

43:01.040 --> 43:08.400
Which is absolutely and utterly and profoundly unscientific as like, you know, I mean it took these these just

43:09.360 --> 43:12.560
In like the specific area of the

43:13.440 --> 43:14.320
WHO

43:14.320 --> 43:18.480
Had this bias for bizarre historical scientific reasons

43:19.040 --> 43:22.400
Against thinking of viruses as airborne, right?

43:22.400 --> 43:28.640
And so you basically had this where the six feet comes from was this whole like droplet theory

43:29.120 --> 43:34.000
Which was shown to be completely incorrect like which never made any godium sense

43:34.560 --> 43:38.720
And was shown to be completely incorrect very early in the pandemic

43:39.200 --> 43:40.160
And it took

43:40.160 --> 43:44.640
WHO like a year and a half to be like well, I guess maybe it might be airborne, right?

43:44.720 --> 43:52.160
Meanwhile in japan, they're like, okay, you know, like better ventilation is like the solution here because it's obviously airborne

43:52.560 --> 43:59.520
Right and they had some sort of native bureaucracy there which could kind of make up its own mind

44:00.240 --> 44:04.400
But the mindset's the point is that basically when you're looking at the way

44:05.440 --> 44:07.440
this system does government

44:08.240 --> 44:10.240
it has

44:10.400 --> 44:12.400
embedded in it a lot of

44:13.280 --> 44:19.840
Extremely bizarre assumptions. Okay. It's like it's like it's like English language where you have these weird words that are just floating around

44:19.840 --> 44:24.320
That mean nothing like what they what they came from or yeah, or just something strange

44:24.640 --> 44:31.680
conjugations like the oxen, you know, and you're just like you can go in the past and you can say oh well

44:31.760 --> 44:33.040
this came from

44:33.040 --> 44:39.520
The dynamics of world war two or like this came from like somebody's high school project about plastic straws, you know

44:40.080 --> 44:41.200
and

44:41.200 --> 44:43.200
watch like how

44:44.560 --> 44:51.920
I mean, I guess my sort of point going back to your original question about monarchy is that

44:52.560 --> 44:57.520
Sort of people are always like they sort of believe in the wisdom or not even the wisdom

44:57.520 --> 45:00.080
But like the sanity of crowds and they're like

45:00.640 --> 45:05.920
One person could be completely mental and start poisoning the burritos or doing them, you know

45:06.480 --> 45:07.680
um

45:07.680 --> 45:13.600
And then but if you have like a community of the smartest best people making the decision

45:14.240 --> 45:17.120
Like how could that go wrong? Like who?

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
Why should like some king who however he was chosen?

45:22.080 --> 45:26.800
Maybe he was just born to be king like and he's making the decisions about virology

45:26.800 --> 45:30.960
Shouldn't the virologist make the decisions about virology and like, you know

45:31.280 --> 45:36.400
The idea that the virologist should make the decisions about virology seems extremely logical

45:36.960 --> 45:40.000
and sensible a confederacy of experts is what we

45:40.320 --> 45:45.840
Yeah, I want and it eventually gets you to covet 19 because it basically

45:46.560 --> 45:48.560
Creates incentives

45:48.880 --> 45:52.080
in within that network of experts where

45:52.720 --> 45:56.240
They basically are in a position position to say well

45:56.960 --> 45:58.960
We need funding to do our work

45:59.200 --> 46:02.160
Um, the more important we are the more funding we get

46:02.880 --> 46:07.920
Therefore it is important for us to find important emerging threats which could be threatening

46:08.480 --> 46:13.760
So let's basically go and collect all the bat viruses while these bat viruses can't you know

46:14.160 --> 46:19.360
Normally infect people because they're bat viruses, but what if they mutated to jump to humans?

46:19.520 --> 46:21.520
That would be very dangerous and scary

46:21.760 --> 46:25.360
Um, let's examine how they could mutate to jump to humans

46:26.000 --> 46:28.880
Uh, well, how could we do that? We could just create some

46:29.920 --> 46:36.960
Examples create some examples, right? You know and and basically you're just like not, you know, um

46:37.920 --> 46:43.120
Realizing in the process of this process of this that you're doing exactly what the like

46:43.760 --> 46:48.000
Dr. Chernobyl did when he's like we got to figure out if this nuclear reactor is safe

46:48.640 --> 46:53.280
Our theory is that if we turn off all the safety systems and run full power

46:53.920 --> 47:02.080
We'll still be safe, right? You know and and and like that's basically what you're doing when you collect these guiding bat viruses, right? And and like

47:02.880 --> 47:04.880
so

47:05.600 --> 47:10.160
Scientists aren't adapted to power power adapts scientists to itself

47:10.320 --> 47:15.040
So so scientists are focused on on on making science or even even trying to

47:15.760 --> 47:17.760
Solve a problem with regards to health

47:18.000 --> 47:22.080
But power itself exerts a shape onto how the science

47:22.480 --> 47:26.880
Happens and what what decisions each end up coming out of and it mutates

47:27.440 --> 47:32.240
And it mutates the culture of science eventually and so basically

47:33.040 --> 47:34.640
to become

47:34.640 --> 47:41.040
We think of scientists as these people driven by pure curiosity puttering around in their labs

47:41.520 --> 47:47.280
Like some, you know, 19th century like, you know, vicar or something that or alchemist studies

47:47.920 --> 47:50.880
studies beetles under a microscope, you know, and

47:51.920 --> 47:57.360
That person is driven entirely by their curiosity and wonder and lefren

47:57.680 --> 48:00.480
And these are the things that cause people to get into science

48:00.960 --> 48:06.480
But the thing is is once you're in science you discover that it's just actually like

48:07.440 --> 48:12.400
Very very cut through a bureaucracy and you have to basically be

48:13.360 --> 48:16.000
A good operator in that bureaucracy and the people

48:16.560 --> 48:24.640
Who turn out to be the best at that are often somewhat mediocre scientists and really world-class bureaucrats

48:25.360 --> 48:30.800
And so you basically sort of everything kind of gets twisted in this direction

48:31.520 --> 48:33.520
Of like

48:34.880 --> 48:37.840
Yeah, I need to justify my importance and the thing is

48:38.640 --> 48:40.800
Most fields are not such that

48:42.960 --> 48:46.800
You can actually create the problems that you're there to solve but like

48:48.240 --> 48:52.560
A virus that goes around the world and kills. Yeah, virology is kind of an exception to that

48:52.640 --> 48:59.600
And so basically these people were, you know, it's like the the classic dc example is the self-licking ice cream cone

48:59.600 --> 49:02.480
Right, but this was like a toxic self-licking ice cream cone

49:02.720 --> 49:04.880
It's like a self-licking ice cream cone is like

49:05.360 --> 49:09.280
A something whose solution only exists to like solve itself like, you know

49:09.760 --> 49:12.240
Like you don't even get the lick the ice cream that licks itself, right, you know

49:12.320 --> 49:17.040
But but in this case it was a toxic self-licking ice cream cone and you look at basically

49:17.840 --> 49:19.840
The bureaucratic incentives

49:20.720 --> 49:22.720
Which caused that

49:22.880 --> 49:28.640
To happen or I think caused that to happen because why would there be such a cover-up when there was nothing to cover up?

49:29.120 --> 49:30.640
right and

49:30.640 --> 49:31.520
the

49:31.520 --> 49:34.240
Yeah, if reputation didn't matter nobody would have to lie

49:35.040 --> 49:37.440
Yeah, right and and and there's clearly

49:38.000 --> 49:45.280
Yes, there's clearly some bad dealing there and like obviously nobody involved in this research wants to admit that this is what happened

49:45.680 --> 49:47.200
right and

49:47.200 --> 49:49.200
And so in every instance

49:49.600 --> 49:51.600
It's it's power that's directing everything

49:51.600 --> 49:56.480
Whether it's it's under the guise of saving the world from this problem or liberating this country over here

49:56.480 --> 50:01.120
There's always power eventually is always operating under the surface because that's eventually what

50:01.840 --> 50:09.280
Happens is and power and power power corrupts things and so basically when you had I mean the way we got

50:09.920 --> 50:11.920
to give sort of

50:12.320 --> 50:14.320
academic models of policy

50:15.120 --> 50:20.080
So much power in the 20th century is we started the 20th century in a world

50:20.560 --> 50:24.240
Where power was largely actually held by corrupt politicians

50:24.720 --> 50:29.360
And that like gilded age country worked a lot the like the way china works today in some ways

50:29.360 --> 50:30.960
It wasn't a dictatorship

50:30.960 --> 50:37.760
But it was a country in which everything was very very corrupt and was done very quickly in this ugly way power was directed

50:38.160 --> 50:43.200
Specifically toward not necessarily the common good, but doing a work, right? It wasn't directed

50:43.520 --> 50:47.600
It was something more solid perhaps it had a kind of corruption

50:47.920 --> 50:51.280
I mean the kind of corruption that existed there

50:51.920 --> 50:54.400
Or exists in china today was like

50:55.200 --> 50:59.520
If the street gets built it may be cost 30 percent more than it should have cost

51:00.000 --> 51:04.080
But it does get built um and but like the level of um

51:05.040 --> 51:07.040
you know

51:07.040 --> 51:12.880
There was also like there was yeah, and and so what happened early in the 20th century

51:12.960 --> 51:18.560
was sort of the beginnings of what we call the progressive movement at that time was that basically

51:19.280 --> 51:22.240
america's hereditary aristocracy

51:23.280 --> 51:25.280
looked at this stuff and

51:25.520 --> 51:27.280
basically saw

51:27.280 --> 51:29.280
that people who

51:29.760 --> 51:30.960
were

51:30.960 --> 51:34.400
Dumber and less sophisticated than them were in charge

51:35.040 --> 51:39.120
And like this is where we get, you know, one of the things I love to cite is this

51:39.760 --> 51:41.200
bizarre

51:41.280 --> 51:43.280
Sort of disconnect between

51:43.920 --> 51:46.640
You know, we have if you think about the two words

51:47.440 --> 51:49.440
democracy and politics

51:49.520 --> 51:55.760
You'll notice that democracy has very very positive connotations and politics has very very negative connotations

51:56.240 --> 51:58.240
but they're actually synonyms

51:58.880 --> 52:05.040
And like how do you have politics without democracy or democracy without and specifically I've heard you say this but

52:05.520 --> 52:11.040
What helped me understand it better was when you talk about populism is basically yeah, right or between democracy

52:11.200 --> 52:16.800
politics is populism which populism is kind of a synonym for like putting politicians in charge

52:17.360 --> 52:20.080
and putting politicians in you know who

52:20.720 --> 52:23.920
Appeal to like what the public wants in charge

52:24.640 --> 52:27.760
Is literally the meaning of representative democracy?

52:28.240 --> 52:30.720
and so one of the things that basically

52:31.760 --> 52:37.840
The progressive movement did is it said we're going to treat representative democracy sort of the way

52:38.160 --> 52:45.520
The modern uk treats its monarchy. We're going to still have these elections, but we're going to make sure

52:46.240 --> 52:51.840
That basically it's really traditional and important and constitutional and necessary

52:52.400 --> 52:56.560
For the president to not really be in charge of the executive branch

52:57.120 --> 53:03.520
Because if the president is like can tell doj who to prosecute like yeah, my god, right?

53:03.600 --> 53:08.960
You know and so it's like saying queen elizabeth the second could say off with her head, right?

53:09.040 --> 53:14.080
You know elizabeth the first could be like off of his head, but like elizabeth the second like

53:14.720 --> 53:17.120
In theory she has the same job, right?

53:18.160 --> 53:20.480
But in practice it's very very different and so

53:21.200 --> 53:25.760
So the aristocracy re-exerted itself or the which would be the oligarchy

53:26.640 --> 53:31.120
Or yeah, right right and sort of created this kind of institutional oligarchy

53:31.920 --> 53:34.560
You know the word meritocracy has been used

53:36.240 --> 53:39.520
Is that is that a cynical take meritocracy? That's a whole other discussion

53:39.520 --> 53:43.280
It was originally in the in the original book by michael young

53:43.760 --> 53:46.000
It was sort of meant as a cynical take

53:46.400 --> 53:48.880
Okay, um, you know merit is a tough

53:49.520 --> 53:52.640
Prove yourself to this particular

53:53.440 --> 53:53.840
organization

53:53.840 --> 53:59.120
But like prove your intelligence or prove that you have a degree from the right school or prove

53:59.120 --> 54:03.120
Or you can jump through the de i hoops and do your equity statement in the right way

54:03.520 --> 54:10.480
Yeah, right, right, right. It's it's it's sort of drifted, you know drifted away from merit or from any

54:11.680 --> 54:19.440
Um ability to do something in the world that's productive other than yeah be a bureaucrat basically right right right right, um

54:20.560 --> 54:22.880
Yeah, so so like the um

54:22.880 --> 54:24.880
Um

54:25.200 --> 54:31.920
Yeah, so so you have this in and you have this situation in which whenever you basically take something that hasn't been

54:32.560 --> 54:36.080
You know power corrupts and when you take something that hasn't been

54:36.800 --> 54:40.400
Corrupted by power such as america's beautiful universities

54:40.880 --> 54:45.440
100 years ago and you say well, why not give these smart and reasonable people power

54:46.080 --> 54:48.480
Surely they won't be corrupted by it in any way

54:49.840 --> 54:51.840
and like basically

54:52.560 --> 54:54.400
by giving

54:54.400 --> 54:59.120
Sort of all these sciences of government real power over government

54:59.680 --> 55:01.680
You've basically wound up, you know

55:02.400 --> 55:09.200
Like you needed a valve in that so that the sewage didn't flow up into the drinking water and the sewage has definitely gotten into the drinking water

55:09.200 --> 55:15.040
Yeah, um and and so like even virology it turns out can be corrupted by power

55:15.440 --> 55:18.800
Because nobody got into virology because they wanted to cause a pandemic

55:19.200 --> 55:23.920
Like, you know, this was not done by like evil scientists like, you know

55:24.800 --> 55:26.080
um

55:26.080 --> 55:29.680
Like this was done by people who were doing

55:30.480 --> 55:32.480
What cune called normal science?

55:32.720 --> 55:35.120
They were basically being like, oh, yeah

55:35.520 --> 55:39.440
And like covet has only increased the funding that's going in this direction now

55:39.440 --> 55:42.480
They're like see emerging viruses can cause huge problems

55:42.800 --> 55:47.440
We really need to make sure we catch all the pokemon and so we're going to wow and go

55:47.520 --> 55:53.040
We're going to go into the bat caves and get more bad viruses and play with them more and like

55:53.520 --> 55:59.920
It's a sort of there's a counter example to that is the tsa being erected in the wake of 9 11

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Like I don't know if that's increased

56:02.160 --> 56:06.480
terrorism itself, but it it the government tapped into this way of uh, you know

56:07.280 --> 56:09.280
Just swallowed this huge

56:09.280 --> 56:14.160
Industry of checking people going through airports, right and now it's just an institution, right?

56:14.160 --> 56:18.560
It doesn't necessarily cause more terrorism, but it's now it's just a waste of time and resources

56:18.560 --> 56:25.280
Yeah, no no no and you're seeing some of that with the the covid control that will will will keep up forever basically

56:25.920 --> 56:27.280
um

56:27.280 --> 56:28.080
the

56:28.080 --> 56:33.120
Yeah, I mean that's that's like that's sort of the self-licking ice cream cone sort of in its

56:33.360 --> 56:38.320
Harmless sense where you have this thing and you know, um, take your shoes off

56:38.800 --> 56:43.040
Take your shoes off because yeah, right, right, right, right and and like the

56:43.680 --> 56:46.000
um, you know, I don't think that

56:46.480 --> 56:50.880
Taking your shoes off and dumping your water is responsible for the like the death of terrorism

56:51.840 --> 56:56.480
Or the death so far never never counted out, right? But um, no, I think that

56:57.360 --> 57:04.720
You know going going around killing people has done a lot of that. Um, but you know, so it's like you can I mean

57:07.120 --> 57:11.920
There's always a sort of defense for like you can sort of be like, yeah, let's you know

57:13.120 --> 57:20.240
Defend the theory that the u.s. Needs to be the world's policeman because otherwise, you know, somebody else would or like they're always like

57:20.880 --> 57:24.000
You know, nothing's quite black and white

57:24.240 --> 57:28.800
but the essential point that I sort of want to make is that

57:29.600 --> 57:33.680
If you're talking about a complete reset of like the meaning

57:34.560 --> 57:36.320
and purpose

57:36.320 --> 57:38.000
of government

57:38.000 --> 57:39.680
you're talking about

57:39.680 --> 57:41.680
something where like

57:42.480 --> 57:46.400
You have a lot of answers to a lot of questions that basically

57:47.440 --> 57:54.560
Date to are like really old and just happening by inertia or camera is something weird like the high school science fair

57:55.120 --> 57:58.960
or like, you know, and the need for kind of

58:00.160 --> 58:04.560
Reconsidering all of these questions in like a reasonable way

58:05.440 --> 58:06.720
is like

58:06.720 --> 58:08.240
the

58:08.240 --> 58:10.240
fundamental driving

58:10.240 --> 58:11.440
force

58:11.440 --> 58:16.960
For imagining a completely different regime. Yeah, and it's sort of hard to know

58:17.760 --> 58:23.600
There's sort of no obvious collective at all in the world that could make these kinds of

58:24.480 --> 58:26.480
Decisions or choices

58:26.560 --> 58:28.000
Collectively

58:28.000 --> 58:31.920
So I I'm bringing this up because I'm pretty sure you're gonna shoot it down

58:32.000 --> 58:34.640
But with the advent of the internet, uh, substack

58:34.640 --> 58:40.320
Let's say that the brief phenomenon of what was called the intellectual dark web just as a concept just as a concept

58:40.640 --> 58:44.720
There could be the case that the prestige makers or the king makers which

58:45.040 --> 58:52.000
Resided in the new york times and in harvard could switch online to these independent content creators that build up reputations and then

58:52.480 --> 58:53.920
bestow

58:53.920 --> 58:55.920
prestige on

58:55.920 --> 58:58.320
various different policies or various different

58:58.720 --> 59:00.720
politicians, right if we

59:00.720 --> 59:06.560
Because if you look at like the new york times of the washington post or harvard, they're spewing out all this bullshit

59:06.560 --> 59:09.440
You know all this we call it wokeness, but there's just a lot of bullshit

59:09.440 --> 59:13.920
It seems like they're they're expending their reputation. They're not making sense anymore more or less

59:14.160 --> 59:20.800
So they're their prestigious going down will not the prestige somehow democratically through the marketplace of attention

59:21.760 --> 59:27.600
Somehow replace that prestige mechanism that gives us the oligarchy that that shelves up the oligarchy

59:28.000 --> 59:32.640
It's a good question. I think the problem is that sort of power is always prestigious

59:33.280 --> 59:35.680
And the thing is you sort of you want

59:36.160 --> 59:41.760
You really want this kind of level playing field on which sense outcompetes nonsense

59:42.400 --> 59:47.600
And you basically look at this playing field and you're like, why does nonsense kind of regularly outcompete?

59:48.240 --> 59:52.000
Sense and it's because the nonsense is powerful and the sense is not

59:52.560 --> 59:54.560
And if you basically

59:55.120 --> 59:57.760
If you even just take sort of isolationism

59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.720
via versus internationalism

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:05.680
Um isolation versus globalism if you want to use two pejoratives there

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.240
um

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.400
What you see is that

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:18.240
There's much much more power in the active thing because the active thing basically is like

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:21.440
We must hire a lot of people to govern the world

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.920
We must think very hard about governing the world

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:28.240
Whereas isolationism is the reverse that isolationism is like

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:34.000
Hey, there's 50 000 of america's like smartest people in the state department. Do we need them? Why?

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.840
right and

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.840
And this sense of and so

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:40.480
Is it really that big it's 50 000 people

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:45.680
Something like that's a little smaller. I think it depends. I don't not that many fsos, but there's a lot of

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.560
Yeah, it's huge, right, you know, and I mean you're governing the world man, you know, like

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:57.760
The indirectly someone but you're governing the world so like the sense of

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:00.960
like what it

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.240
Takes to

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.360
like

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.240
There's sort of no situation under which

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.240
the

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.760
idea that

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:17.840
Is not a source of power is going to outcompete the idea that is a source of power naturally

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.240
Or it's like you're like, okay. Yeah

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:22.960
Harvard like

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:28.080
Like you might as an intellectual as a critic

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:32.960
Start to develop a community of people who have a low opinion of harvard

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:41.200
But how is that community of people going to develop the endowment the cultural capital the like regime capital?

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.840
like, you know to like

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:49.920
You're not really talking about a private institution when you you're talking about harvard and the new york times

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.240
You're talking about if these things were officially parts of the government

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:59.440
They'd be instantly recognizable as the most important and powerful parts of the government

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:06.720
Right and and so the question is while while the governor the trust in the government and the trust in harvard the trust in

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:12.320
The washington or the the new york times all these all these legacy institutions. They're they're spewing bullshit

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:16.880
They're spewing the stuff that doesn't make sense. They're but the trust doesn't come from their

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.240
Like ability to make sense their reputation

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:23.920
their reputation their prestige ultimately

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:28.160
Does not come from that reputation

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:32.320
There's a lot of things that they have to do to maintain that prestige

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:37.200
And there's certainly a lot of sort of prestige generating things

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:42.400
That happen there and they certainly do select a lot of very smart people

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:45.040
even though, you know

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.520
Admissions are what they are

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.840
but the like

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:52.560
The sort of

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:56.960
There's no way to offshore that to the internet. Yeah, there's there's no way there's no way

01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:00.080
Yeah, there's no way for sort of this like 90s dream

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.400
of like people

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:07.600
Without any status or power competing with that because basically the

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.640
like

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:19.600
The ingredient the active ingredient is basically inertial the active ingredient union is that harvard is harvard and you're not

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:25.760
and like your ability to sort of crack into that business is like, I mean

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:28.800
You know, it's like there's a list of um

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:33.760
You know the top 14 law schools. I don't know why it's 14. It is 14

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.240
Why is it 500 fortune?

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:41.520
If you go, I don't know the length of the original at least it's at least it's the round number

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:47.040
The top 14 law schools have been the same top 14 law schools for the last 50 years

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:53.200
they're selected by something called us news and world report which used to be a magazine of some kind and

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.200
They haven't changed in the last 50 years and by the way, if you're going to law school and you're not getting a top 14 degree

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.760
useless don't do it and

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:05.600
You'll find yourself doing like discovery work or like shit work, right?

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:10.640
You know, only the top 14 law schools are real law schools, right? So, you know, basically

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:14.240
How do you break into that? Like

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:20.400
It's just no way just to think of it as basically part of the government and then you're just like when you ask the question

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:23.200
Of how does this change?

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.080
Or how is this shut down?

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:28.720
you will not expect

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:36.160
automatic automatic market mechanisms to do that for you because actually the market loves the stenershia

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:37.760
um

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:44.880
You can bet on it. Yeah, it's like, you know, it's it works, right? There's nothing that makes it not work

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:53.040
Um, even if it's creating bad laws or like, uh, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. It's like there's like a just world theory here

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:56.720
That's basically telling you that like when harvard starts

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:04.400
Teaching nonsense people will stop when we go to harvard and or people will stop listening to harvard or they will be like

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:11.280
No, it doesn't really work that way. Um, it's like when harvard ends. It's because basically

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:18.720
Somebody upstages it with another thing or it just collapses loses all this or or somebody infiltrates it

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:22.400
or the or or the police, um,

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.960
simply lock the doors and

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:27.440
Declare that, um

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:32.720
The campus has been seized of the trademark. It's been seized. I think it down has been seized

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:39.200
Right, you know, and and and so and and so the the thing is that basically and that's the that's the yeah, right

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:43.120
And and so the thing is that that when you basically

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:45.760
You know are sort of expecting

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.240
these things to happen

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:49.440
in

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:55.520
An automatic way and you basically are like well, this is an outrage but like

01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:00.880
God is just and god will fix it in some way and therefore I don't have to

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:06.560
Um, or power doesn't have to know like actually only power can revise power

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.840
If you look for example at like germany in 1945

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.560
Let's take germany in 1945

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.240
The occupying regime

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.960
american military government, um

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:24.960
Mg I've got the acronym has the same powers as hitler right not only can they

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:30.800
You know, they can destroy anything that hitler created. They're not like oh, well the ss is losing its prestige

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:35.760
He wants to join the ss and you know anymore now in 1946 like no, that's not how it worked

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:40.480
You know when east germany was shut down it wasn't like the stasi is losing its prestige

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:42.960
Right, it was like no actually

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:46.080
There is a new power over this and the new power

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:49.600
Has the power to just force this to cease to exist

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.240
and it will cease to exist and

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:58.080
So like if you look at the denazification of germany and the sort of level of

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:01.280
There are two things that stand out about that one is

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:08.720
The level of force required to denazify germany and the level of violence required to denazify germany

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:11.120
the level of violence after

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:18.720
Conquering germany, which took quite a bit of violence the level of violence needed to enforce that was almost zero

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:22.000
There was a huge fear, you know of basically

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:26.560
You know the occupying forces are coming into occupied germany. They're like this is the most

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:30.000
Propagandized nationalist population in history

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:34.240
Hitler has been filling their heads full of pure crazy for 13 years

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:38.720
Like clearly what's going to happen is they're going to start like these like guerrilla movements

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:42.880
They're going to go all like werewolf. There's going to be ied's like there's going to be

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:47.200
None of that happened. Yeah, almost none of it same thing in japan

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:51.760
Incredibly fanatical population drilled with all this propaganda

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:56.000
You take absolute power over them and they're like quiet as lambs

01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:03.120
And their minds change, but that didn't happen in afghanistan and something about no that didn't happen in afghanistan

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:06.800
that didn't have happened in afghanistan because basically

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:08.720
the

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:11.040
When you look at the way in which

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:18.640
Like or like the specific directives like jcs 1067 is the directive for occupying germany

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:24.400
You read this and it's basically a document of imperialism and it includes things like

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:29.120
Americans are not allowed to fraternize with germans. They're not allowed to make friends with germans

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:33.360
We have to understand get them to understand that this is a conquered country

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:39.600
You know whereas in afghanistan, it's like we didn't conquer you would conquer we didn't conquer afghanistan

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:42.800
We liberated afghanistan. We're here to advise you

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:46.720
And so we're not in command. We're not telling you what to do

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:51.520
So we kind of basically just pass it aggressively want you to do what we say

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.960
And yeah, and we're going to give you more money if you do what we say, but we're not in command here

01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:02.720
That's imperialism. My god. We would never do that. That's bad. That would cause instant, you know revolutions

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:07.120
Like absolutely terrible, right and the thing is so basically

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:09.360
You know

01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:14.400
It's only that absolute is the total conquering attitude that actually affects change

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:20.960
There's a there's a there's a an analogy that the victorians used to use which is grasping the nettle

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:27.920
A nettle is a plant you'll find it in the pacific northwest a lot and in england with stinging hairs on it

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:33.760
And supposedly if you touch a nettle, I have done this and it's very painful if you touch a nettle it will hurt

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:38.720
But if you grasp it firmly it will like compress the hairs so that they don't sting

01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:44.080
And basically the lesson of grasping the nettle, which is something also very relevant in parenting

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:49.920
you know weak parents are the ones who yell at their kids and the

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:57.200
The the the sense you're not a parent. Are you um, you know, but I'd work with kids for

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:03.120
A few decades now the the but I was just thinking about like the like showing up to school. This is this is why you're uh

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:09.680
constitutionally opposed to showing up to school board meetings or making these little laws against wokeness here and there

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:15.360
Yeah, yeah, that's just you're just touching the nettle. You're not actually you're just touching the nettle

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:22.480
You're not actually grasping the nettle and so you'll basically see you know in any situation with kids like

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:27.280
The nice substitute teacher is in a room that is a war zone

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:31.680
Whereas the extremely strict teacher never raises her voice

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:38.080
right and and the the like the the sense of that and that's just a

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:45.680
Basic principle of like governance and management which again of power which again is completely lost here and so basically

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:51.760
um, you know the occupiers in 45 came in with this extremely

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:58.000
Determined attitude which actually in Germany was quite rough in japan. It was not rough

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
But in in Germany they were quite rough

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:05.760
But we were more lenient to japan than to germany. Yes because it was being run by macarthur specifically

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:06.400
um

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:09.280
And macarthur was kind of an old asia hand who kind of you know

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:15.520
Had a sense of what to do whereas there were a lot of like ideological fanatics in the the government of the new germany

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.040
You may have heard of the like morgan fowl plan or stuff like that

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:22.400
um, but yeah, it was like it was like it was

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:28.160
There were things like intentional starvation policies and shit, which nobody talks about. Um, yeah

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.680
and um

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:37.760
No, I could I could see like psychologically because we're closer related to germans that we would really want to kind of

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.400
Beat it out of them. The ideology

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:48.160
Of the time you can go. I always recommend this to people go on the internet. There's a little movie from 1945

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.080
This is the seuss one

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:53.600
The yeah, the seuss one hitler lives hitler lives. It's absolutely worth seeing

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.400
and um

01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:03.200
And and just don't like worry about the fact that you're typing the word hitler lives into a google search box

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:05.840
It's a historical documentary. It's very anti-nazi

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:11.360
to say the least um, and and your mind will be blown and the um

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:14.480
But yeah, you know, so

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:18.960
I think a better example in some ways is the deconstruction of east germany

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:27.280
Because again, it's like when in 89 99 right, you know, because when you have a real regime change in a country

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.760
Everyone's life changes

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:34.880
Like there's no like everyone's life changes. Every institution is different

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:40.480
Anything that remains is reconstructed. Most things do not remain

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:42.400
and

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:48.160
There's no like there's no sense that like the stasi was going to be turned into like a you know

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:54.560
Something different in 1989 or the ss was going to be turned into something different in 1945

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:59.440
That's not the way it works. And so the thing is that if you basically

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:03.520
Are really talking about a change of regime

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:06.160
You're talking about basically

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:13.520
Taking all of these powerful institutions inside or outside the government and basically

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:20.800
Deconstructing them and your experience just across the board by fiat across the board by fiat and you know

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:27.200
The experience of being because you're basically saying you're declaring that these were unofficial parts of the government

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:32.400
And then you're reorganizing that part of the government. Yeah, and and you know the experience of being

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:39.920
In one of these institutions or part of this sort of ruling class like that should not

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:42.720
Be a like

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:49.520
Painful experience. It is a little painful when basically, you know, you're a major in the stasi

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:55.920
You put your whole career into this like whatever you've served faithfully serve the german democratic republic

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:58.960
And like one day you're like, I know there were problems

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:03.840
It wasn't perfect like but you know like what what are you going to do? And then one day one day one day

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.840
It's all over right, you know

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:11.600
And the your ideology the day before it's all over is just like

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.960
We are the guardians of the revolution

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:20.320
You know if like western imperialists subjugate our country. We are

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:28.320
Professional revolutionaries. We will conspire in the cafes. We will plant our bombs. We will be just like linen and Stalin

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:33.920
And then you realize you're not like linen and Stalin the day after you're like, oh, I was just a bureaucrat

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.320
Guess what happens to you as a bureaucrat?

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:38.000
You get a pension

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Okay, you're retired, you know, there's

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:42.800
Are you saying that we have to pay off all the gender studies?

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:50.480
Professors all of them all the critical theorists. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely because the thing is that basically

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:54.080
that is absolutely because that

01:14:54.320 --> 01:15:00.320
Is the only way to respect what they were actually doing what they were actually doing

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:05.440
Was not wrong because they were faithfully serving the old regime

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:12.560
They were okay. Maybe if they did something especially evil like that could be looked at but it's like

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.200
the principle that

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:17.600
this is why like

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Germany today still pays pensions

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.680
I believe not only to stasi officers even to some vermarked officers

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:27.760
Right because basically what you're saying is that

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:30.400
If you say to these people

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:33.440
You're an alien force. You're not part of society

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:36.640
Like you're saying

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:41.040
We don't really own you we don't really care about you

01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:47.840
You're an outcast you should go and plot your next revolution because that's the only way you'll have a future

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:51.280
Whereas if you're saying to them, yeah, you know what it's like

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:59.040
Yeah, you were a professor of marxist linenist literature at the moscow university in 1987 like what is your future?

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.600
I don't know was it bad

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:07.440
Read a book read a novel like was it bad to study marxist linenist literature like yeah, okay?

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:13.920
You know you read literature. It's fine. You're smart. You can teach school, you know, like, you know the there's like

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:16.320
the sense of

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:18.320
sort of responsible

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:22.080
Leadership is very much the sense of like

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:25.760
If you have never dehumanize

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:30.880
Never be human if you have a regime that feels that it represents

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.520
Only a part of the country

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
That's like very bad

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.880
and so the sense of basically

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:43.760
any kind of monarchy any kind of new regime of any form

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.160
in

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:52.320
This country like one of the things that is going to be kind of its best biggest selling point

01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:55.360
Is that it's ending the kind of cold civil war?

01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:58.160
And so the sense of basically

01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:02.720
You know, what are you if you were like a critical theorist english professor like

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:05.920
Okay, you were someone who's

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:09.840
Entire world basically just a preacher

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:16.000
With yeah, if you're someone whose entire world was consumed by the ideology of the old regime

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:17.760
um

01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:20.240
The old regime has turned to dust and fallen away

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:26.080
And like you can't go on doing that like there's no world in which people are going to pay you to do that

01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:27.440
but

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:29.440
That doesn't make you a bad person

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:34.400
That doesn't make it just means that you had a bullshit job under the old regime. Guess what?

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:37.520
A lot of people had bullshit jobs under the old regime

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:43.360
Right because like a lot of bullshit was done, right? And so the sense of basically

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:48.880
It's over and like everyone should be fine with that

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:53.440
It's over and that's fine rather than it's over and like

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.520
Now begins the vengeance, right? You know, it's just like

01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:02.560
So why why do you think that when biden first came in he's like i'm the we're the party of unity

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:04.800
We're going to unify the country and at this point in time

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:10.560
He's now more or less actively like saying ultramaga. He's like doing this weird kind of rhetoric

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:15.280
It seems kind of impotent, but it's still kind of dangerous where he's other half of the country

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:20.720
Why would he do that? Like if that's not to support because he's you know, leaning on

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:25.040
The half that supports him and he is like, um

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:33.840
So he's caught in the trap of his unity. His unity is fundamentally hegemonic in in form and it can't basically

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:38.240
This sense of like I own my base, but I own your base too

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:41.200
Is the kind of unity that's like

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:44.160
You know, that's a dominant

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:48.640
like and of course dominating basically the flyover people and basically

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:51.360
sort of, um

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:53.840
You know

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:59.040
Yeah, keeping them keeping this outcast or deplorables or keeping basically

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:05.680
Like them in this sort of frame of mind where they're like you should be good enough to vote for me, you know, um

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:10.720
In in sort of this like keeping the kind of structure between the aristocracy

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:17.120
sort of blue state aristocracy and the red state bourgeoisie is is like, you know, you

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:20.720
should aspire to be one of us and if you don't maybe your children will

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:22.640
and

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:28.400
It's not like that does not represent like there's sort of no actually like

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:33.680
Oh, I care about red state people and I want them to be able to live their lives in like a red state way

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:38.080
No, do you think that there's something in the system that's causing him to not be able to do that?

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:42.560
Like if you wanted to be the the unifying president and at this point it's fallen apart

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:43.440
I mean

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:49.680
Whether regardless if it's him or not who's making these decisions and writing these talking points like if that was what they wanted to do

01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:51.920
What's keeping them from unifying?

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:54.880
Well, you'd have to actually out trumping trump

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:58.960
You know, you you'd because you lose your own

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:02.880
base essentially, it's like you have to give

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:06.400
If you're gonna like basically say

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:09.200
I mean

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:12.160
One of the things that you see sort of american

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:16.640
Leftism or many leftisms do is they sort of

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:19.440
Circulate their clients

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:25.840
And so there's always this sort of client population, you know, where a hundred years ago. It's the working class

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:28.160
It's the factory worker, right?

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:30.720
And the thing is that at a certain point

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:36.640
The factory worker is no longer an asset and what we really need is basically

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:40.160
Instead of a class war we needed a race and culture war

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:46.960
Or we're like our asset is like black americans. No way. We actually prefer mexicans

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:54.000
Um, they're more of them now and so like we're gonna let the mexicans take the blacks jobs

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:58.400
Right or whatever right, you know and and this sense of

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.800
and like

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:04.480
The working class like stuck with these people for

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:07.200
A very long time you have the union

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:10.560
Midwest union people right who basically

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:16.720
Have been sort of voting democratic or we're voting democratic on autopilot for 50 or 60 years

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:20.160
Until they realized that they were actually no longer

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:26.720
The like mascot. They were now the goat. Um, if you look at the populations that

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:29.200
Who voted for f dr?

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:32.080
Well, who voted for f dr was a thin, you know

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:35.520
cream of aristocrats like him and then

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.800
The solid south

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:43.280
Though, you know old democratic segregationist regimes who were

01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:49.360
Democrats because robert lee was a democrat and i've always voted democrat and i'm robert lee was a good man

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:52.240
You know and then the inner city catholics

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:58.880
Right and the inner city catholics and slavs who you're like what because they don't exist anymore

01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:01.680
They all got but what was their attraction like?

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:04.560
um, again

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:12.320
Traditional ethnic traditional ethnic power politics, right and so those were ethnic machines and those machines were basically

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:14.880
had always been

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:18.720
You know the democrats where america's sort of conservative party in a way

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:23.280
But they were also the party of like the catholics and the inner city

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:25.680
Like old, you know camity hall

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:29.680
And like the old sort of these old style political machines

01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:33.520
And these old style political machines basically like

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:37.920
You know when the solid south puts f dr into power

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:42.560
They're setting into motion the forces that would destroy the solid south

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:48.000
They have no idea they don't think of themselves when they vote for democrats is voting for liberals

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:51.200
They think of themselves as voting for robert lee, right?

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:53.840
And so they were the same thing with the union democrats

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.840
Yeah, they kept on voting for robert lee up until like the 1960s when they're like wait a second

01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:02.880
Like this is no longer the party of robert lee, right?

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:06.720
And so it's sort of easy when you have a client base

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:09.280
That trusts you like that

01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:14.720
Those are the people that are going to get abused because when you can take someone for granted

01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:16.800
you know

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:21.360
That's who you abuse and and so you know like the sense of

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:29.360
You know, there's clearly in sort of voting in the new deal which would eventually bring them the civil rights movement

01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:33.520
There's a sense in which you know, the mark cistern false consciousness

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:38.480
Is applicable to all of these segregationists who were voting for f dr

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:45.200
They sort of knew he wasn't really a segregationist, but you know, like robert lee was a democrat, right? And so

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:50.320
When you look at the various like sort of solid

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:55.200
Blocks in um india to have this wonderful term which is vote bank

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:59.200
Which is like a group of like ethnic votes that a politician can count on

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:04.240
So, you know, when you look at basically like the like democratic vote bank or whatever

01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:07.040
um, you're basically seeing

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:16.240
Yeah, I mean like certainly like so with biden is there's something about the uh his base his vote bank that needs that

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:18.640
antagonism with this other

01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:24.640
Vote bank that he's locked into this party policy. Yeah, he's he's called civil war as you call it. Yes. Yes

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:29.520
I mean blue state america is deeply locked into this cold cold civil war because there's really

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:32.640
Not much they can say anymore

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:40.400
To get, you know, the white working class or whatever. Yeah, right, you know, and and there's but there's still like there's a lot of

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:45.920
Aspirational support out there. There's a lot of people who sort of look up to the upper class

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:49.280
There's a lot of people like there's a lot of that, you know

01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:54.800
Even that like, you know, I mean this is where biden came from in the 70s

01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:57.440
He's going around Delaware, which is after all a southern state

01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:03.520
Basically telling everyone, you know, what a bad idea busing and desegregation are I mean, he's lived that long, right?

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:07.920
You know, and so in the 90s he's talking about super predators, you know

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:11.920
Like I mean, this is a very empty hollow man

01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:16.080
Which is just sort of the voice of the power around him. Yeah, exactly

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:21.680
So he's a great. He's a great image of what we're actually dealing with in a while. Yeah, yeah, right, right, right?

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:27.200
I like I mean, I let's let's elect him again in 2024 as he gets older and older

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:34.160
Um, I think it would be beautiful and and the uh, he might actually just start drooling in front of his teleprompter

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:38.320
the autumn of the page if he hasn't done that already, you know, and um

01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:42.720
Yeah, so so so like when you

01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:45.440
you know

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:50.400
You sort of imagine, you know monarchy this like exotic system of government, which is, you know

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:55.840
The system of government that like 99 of all people in history have lived under

01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:00.800
And then you're like, but it could be insane and do weird insane things and I'm like

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:05.440
Actually, there's a lot of insanity there right now. You're just used to it

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:11.680
Well, especially if if you I think there might be three kind of state you said there's a wartime and then the peacetime kind of

01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:12.960
uh

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:19.680
Executive but there could be like a cleanup executive and then kind of a prosperous executive and then a stabilizing executive like there's kind of

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:22.960
Yeah, the cleanup executive is definitely like the wartime

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:30.320
executive essentially and just being able to explicitly call out power and and to regulate power through one

01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:33.280
explicit means rather than having going through this

01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:35.840
oligarchical

01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:41.280
Institutional process that gets all these weird ideas in it that it can't shake down if you have like one

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.840
free agent that

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:45.040
all

01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:47.040
Through which all power flows

01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:53.280
And the potential to clean up and then to also make decisions or at least to make decisions cleanly that can then be

01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:55.680
held account

01:26:55.680 --> 01:27:01.040
One way or another rather than it being lost in all these processes right is much

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:07.200
Yeah, yeah, it's much more. It's much more. I mean, and it's just like you look at I constantly say this

01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:11.360
But like if you look at anything that gets done in the real world today, it's done by a monarchy

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:15.200
Drive a car is made by a monarchy, you know that microphone in front of you

01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:20.080
It was made by a monarchy, which is a company in China, which is another monarchy

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:22.800
So like the set of like if you look around you

01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:29.440
You see a world made by monarchies within monarchies and and like the

01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:36.080
If there was an effective oligarchical or republican way to run a company

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:40.640
somebody would have that worked better than that somebody certainly would have found it

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:42.160
and

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:48.000
Because there's nothing stopping you from having a company that's run by a congress and a judiciary and a president and all that right?

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:50.640
and um

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:52.640
But but that's a way to run a railroad

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:58.320
But in order for us to make that leap there has to be a huge change of view by the american

01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:02.960
Populus towards power and and one thing is to expose it like you're doing

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:08.160
But it's another to like try to get people on the same page because everybody that I tell your ideas to recoils

01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:13.600
I'm living in washington and portland. So, you know, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course a washington state

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:18.320
Yeah, right and and and and and so and and they recoil

01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:20.960
in a way

01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:26.960
They recoil for a couple of different reasons. They recoil at a sense of alieness and they also feel

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:28.880
um

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:30.880
subconsciously that

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:35.200
A source of meaning in their lives would be taken away

01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:37.120
and

01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:39.120
The sense of having power

01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:44.640
For them is not about having a government that treats them. Well, it's about

01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:49.360
mattering in a sense and this idea that they would no longer matter

01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:52.000
in that way

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:58.080
Feels emasculating it feels like basically people have a natural power drive

01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:00.800
and that sort of power drive is kind of

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:08.240
Being exploited in them to give this them this illusion of mattering. Whereas it's actually sort of turns into

01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:10.000
support

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.600
it's like basically

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:13.600
Your desire to matter

01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:20.160
This guy, um, this great political scientist Guy Tana Mosca from over 100 years ago had this great term

01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:22.240
Which is a political formula

01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:26.640
And a political formula is whatever you believe that causes you to support the government

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:32.720
So you might be in ancient egypt and you might believe that pharaoh should be on the throne because pharaoh is the son of

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:38.720
You know the great grandson of god or something and yeah myth and basically if pharaoh is not on the throne

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:43.840
Then the sun will not come up in the morning, right? And that's a political formula

01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:49.200
And you know 20th century political formulas tend to resolve around

01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:52.560
I feel powerful because I support the government

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:57.120
Or you think or are you right or you know all of these

01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:02.320
Yeah, all of these things giving you a sense of meaning and importance

01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:07.120
And the thing is you're sort of trading what you don't realize is that you're trading

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
That in order for this basically

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:15.840
pornographic feeling of meaning and importance which is pornographic because it's not real

01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:20.160
You're not actually in the decision loop when you look at Ukraine

01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:26.000
You're not actually like moving ukraine and you know armies around on the battlefield like a chess board

01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:31.760
You're just having this kind of pornographic feeling of feeling like you are defending ukraine

01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:36.960
Just like when you view pornography, you're like i'm i'm doing it with this girl, but you're not

01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:39.440
you know and and so

01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:42.080
what that basically

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:45.200
That sort of change of

01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:47.760
That myth

01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:53.840
That change yeah that myth that formula and what rejecting that formula sort of allows you to do

01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:56.480
is basically to change

01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.040
exchange this

01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:03.200
To set aside this delusional sense of power and importance

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:06.320
And replace it with something that actually matters

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:13.280
You can become if you basically can conquer your emotional desire for importance

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:18.560
Then she called it like political nofap at some point. Yeah. Yeah. It's like political nofap or it's like, you know

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:23.200
The thing that I always uh, you know the example that I always use I don't think this actually works in real life

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:28.080
But um, there's this um legendary monkey banana trap where you basically

01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:33.280
Have a banana and you and it's inside a little enclosure and the monkey puts its hand in the box

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:38.000
And then cannot get its hand out of the box without letting go with a banana

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:43.200
And so and then the hunter comes along and cracks it on the head and eats fried monkey for dinner, right?

01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:45.120
and and like

01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:52.400
And you're like there are a lot of bananas outside the box, but you have to be able to let go of the banana

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:58.160
And the sort of the problem of letting go of the banana if you look at

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:03.440
The capacity here is why I'm optimistic about the ability

01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:05.920
For people to solve this problem

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:14.080
Which they clearly haven't been able to do in the past. I'm optimistic about it because first of all when you compare

01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:18.960
Americans today and the way they interact with politics

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:24.720
To the way they interacted a hundred years ago. They're much more apathetic

01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:30.880
They're sort of much less like they're much less ready ready. For example to engage in political violence

01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:34.720
Um, they're much to show up to seven hour zoom meetings

01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:40.640
Seven hour, you know, or seven hour like riots, right? You know, like you can't you know

01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:45.120
like like the um, but the race riots in 2020

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:52.400
Yeah, but the thing is the last time you see like white people rioting is like the 40s for example

01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:59.520
um, or you know, even like january 6 is like this incredibly pathetic thing like it's not

01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:04.960
It's pretty well, I don't know according to the democrats like it's a national holiday now

01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:11.040
They have the ceremonies and stuff about it. It's pretty powerful. It's pretty it's pretty limp, uh, you know and and like

01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:13.280
Yeah, I'll show you right, you know

01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:19.680
You want to see you want you want to see a riot, you know, um the um, um

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:26.960
It's it's it's pretty limp and but but but we're we're expending that in a pornographic way on twitter by

01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:31.600
Doing all this culture. We're you're saying is this culture where stuff is just pornographic

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:38.720
It's a pornographic experience release and you know the thing that can compete with pornography is sex

01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:40.720
It's like basically

01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:44.480
Whenever you sort of show people how to have actual sex

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:46.400
um, you know

01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:49.600
That is the one way to pull them away from their porn and so

01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:52.400
The thing is I'm like no

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:57.200
What you're doing cannot result in any real political change, but actually

01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:03.280
Real things can happen and here's how and that's sort of exciting even

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.920
If it doesn't have

01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:10.720
That's exciting at a different level and in a different sense because you're like, okay

01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:14.480
They're not close to happening. It's not about to happen

01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:20.320
And what all this sort of pornographic politics is offering me is the sense that like this is about to happen

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:25.440
Well, like elect trump and like amazing things will happen and you know, or like we'll let you know

01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:29.600
And and I'm like no none of this nothing will happen as a result of these elections

01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:34.160
But the thing is if you want to think in a way that would

01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:38.560
Lead if you can get other people to think in this way

01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:41.200
Real things to happen

01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:43.840
There's something actually more exciting about that

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:48.240
And it's exciting in a like subtle and ironic way

01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:53.520
The idea that the way to have real power is like give up your power

01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:56.160
Has this ironic quality to it

01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:59.440
And the thing is that we are living

01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:03.440
We have the most ironic population history

01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:09.840
There's never been any period in history when like irony was his mass market

01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:15.360
The memes are a flowing my friend never anywhere close and so basically

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:20.560
How is irony a political force like I've heard you bring this up, but what is it about it?

01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:24.640
It's a political force because it basically allows you to like say like

01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:30.640
Fuck it in a really interesting way. There's the none of the apocetic like you know that no

01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:33.600
Not in did you know the british show black mirror?

01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:39.920
Oh, yeah, yeah, if there's a there's a black mirror episode I always point people to where

01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:44.640
The population elects a cartoon character

01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:48.960
As a joke or is it like comment or is this something right?

01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:53.440
Yeah, you know and it's like or if you look at something like sort of storm area 51

01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:59.520
That didn't come off area 51 wasn't stormed. Oh, yeah, but it kind of gives you a sense of like

01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:02.000
that

01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:04.080
The sense of

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:08.880
Like there will be whenever this thing comes crashing down

01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:12.800
There will be like a ludic a playful sense to it

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:16.320
Much as there was like especially like shekels of akia

01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:19.920
In 89 with like the the velvet revolution

01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:27.280
You know, um, you had this real sense of playfulness to it like an important aspect the venture of the velvet

01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:29.760
revolution was this like

01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:35.600
Sort of a banned plastic people of the universe. It was kind of velvet underground influence

01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:41.040
Like, you know, and so you had a revostov hovel who's just like ironic playwright becomes the you know

01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:44.480
It was from being a dissident to the president in Czechoslovakia

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:46.480
Um

01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:51.600
We saw the little bit of that in the trucker uh convoy in canada. There was a communal thing

01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:58.480
But the weird thing about that was that that's where truto like showed the power of the state to people of their finances

01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:01.200
Which is really scary and people took it like

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:04.080
Yeah, and people took it like way too

01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:06.800
Like seriously in a way

01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:14.160
And his his his move to no the banks. No the truckers the truckers took themselves way too seriously

01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:19.520
I'm sort of not seriously enough like they didn't like like like there was yeah

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:25.520
I mean, they were they were kind of larping in the end. They weren't like it wasn't it sounds like you're you're advocating for larping

01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:30.640
But there's like some sort of truth sincerity this room. Yeah, there's there's like there's like

01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:35.360
You sort of do it as a lark, but it becomes real. It's like a basically

01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:40.240
The sense of being a sort of a joke that makes itself real

01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:42.880
I think will be kind of part

01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:49.600
Of this thing. That sounds kind of like apocalyptic or revelatory. Well, it's in a way. I mean, I mean

01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:54.080
We talked about Ukraine Ukraine elected a comedian as president, right?

01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:58.480
You know and so there's this sense of like

01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:04.960
It will feel sort of almost accidental. It won't have this sort of like

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:08.720
Patriots rise up to like, you know

01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:11.680
feeling it won't it will be like

01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:15.440
We can't take this seriously like a carnival, right?

01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:18.640
Yeah, it will have it. It will have a very joyous

01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:25.200
Feel and not a very like a carnival. It will feel very joyous and it will not feel like

01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:29.760
And it will feel sort of that image irreversible

01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:34.560
coupled with the outcome of like somebody with absolute power completely just

01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:38.640
Liquidating all the institutions and rebooting them, which is like the most serious thing

01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:42.560
I mean, it's comedic like like I read I've been reading your sub-stack

01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:46.240
We get to the part like well, how are we going to change things and it's so out

01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:50.800
It's just so absurd. It's like we're just going to tear everything apart. We're going to take complete authority

01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:57.920
It's like what he can't do that. Yeah, and it breaks my brain every time I right and and and and that the sense of basically like

01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:05.440
Voting for that or voting to be like, you know, it's like, you know, one of the ways I sort of picture it is as I'm like

01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:08.160
imagine you're in

01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:13.120
Like the little room with the astronaut at like the end of 2001, right?

01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:17.760
And you're just in this like weird space and like there's like playing food all right Dave, right?

01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:22.640
You know, I'm sorry Dave. I can't do that, you know and and like but there's one difference

01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:27.440
There's a red button on the wall and under the red button. It says if you press this button

01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:30.480
everything will change

01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:31.840
well

01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:36.320
serious sober like a hard-working respectable people

01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:41.280
Are not going to grown-ups are not going to press that button because they're like

01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:44.160
We could just be shot into out into space. That would be a change

01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:47.680
but you know who presses the button is basically

01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:52.880
immature people childlike people like people who are

01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:55.040
have

01:39:55.040 --> 01:40:00.160
a sense of fun which is much bigger than their sense of seriousness and so, you know

01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:08.640
The people of america today are not minute men. They are not like the like paul revere is not in the building

01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:12.320
Like they do not act out of like a deep sense of

01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:19.760
Have you seen every couple months? Like there's this really stupid group of like supposed white supremacist, but it's totally an fbi sting

01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:24.080
It's like there's just footage of them. Do you know what i'm talking about? Like they're the people's army or something

01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:31.520
Yeah, and everybody's laughing at them. Nobody believes that that actually is serious right and and and and so the sense of like

01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:34.000
you know

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
that sense of

01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:38.800
Like really

01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:44.160
Deep comedy and irony like that's so ironic that it's real

01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:49.520
Is like really crucial to that sort of spirit

01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:53.920
So how did you get this idea of any possible regime change? How did you come to this?

01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:57.360
conception um

01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:02.240
I think that it's sort of part of

01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:12.240
Kind of being brought up in the american upper class and kind of understanding

01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:15.200
it's like spirit

01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:17.360
in a way

01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:18.240
and

01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:20.240
it's like when you

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:24.880
A good way to sort of track the spirit is in popular entertainment

01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:31.120
It's like imagine if you took a film like inception and you put it in movie theater in 1962

01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:36.640
Like people would be like coming out of their theater just like grabbing their heads like stunned monkeys, right?

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:40.800
You know even in like 1992 that would be like a cult film

01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:45.040
But like 20 years after that it's like a blockbuster and people are like

01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:49.040
Oh, yeah, there's three levels reality and I fall back into the bathtub every the next month, right?

01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:52.800
You know and it's like their ability to sort of switch frames

01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:54.000
Yeah

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:59.040
Is like really really great and it's sort of much easier to just like

01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:02.960
They're sort of their attachment when you're in this sort of ironic

01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:08.240
Sophisticated state of mind. You're like attachment to the prison frame

01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:10.960
Is just not that great

01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:13.120
and so

01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:20.800
To like move you sort of along the ground is still like hard. It's hard to reason people into something

01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:23.920
but like when you're just like no

01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:30.000
Throw away everything about the way you see the world and like change to see it in this other way

01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:32.960
There's a lot of people who are just like, okay

01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:36.880
Sure, right and and that comes out of a kind of frivolousness

01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:41.280
That comes out of a like lack of virtue in a sense

01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:46.080
But like politics is the art of the possible and the thing is if you're looking for basically

01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:49.360
a politics of virtue

01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:52.960
to like unite a fundamentally

01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:56.240
Unsterious and unvirtuous population

01:42:56.400 --> 01:43:00.960
But there's still perfor larping like this bloodbath this civil war on twitter, right?

01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:04.560
Yeah, right, right and and it's just like and it's just like you can do

01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:06.560
like

01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:13.120
And you know the feeling of sort of popping people out of that is very refreshing and like the whole sort of

01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:18.240
framework of the debate the cold civil war the like issues or whatever

01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:22.080
Very tiresome very uninteresting very unchewy

01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:24.640
Your ability to get ahead

01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:28.880
left-wing politics was sort of designed to get people ahead

01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:34.400
Or it's like works sort of like like up up the classes. Is that we mean like yeah or up

01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:38.720
You know up the like rise and like have a career and a profession

01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:42.720
You know, it's like one of the ways that I described like the early new deal

01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:46.080
Is that it really was like a start-up Washington in a lot of ways

01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:50.800
And like you're like life cycle of being in the new deal had this like start-up quality

01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:57.120
Like you would graduate from say Harvard with a degree in this new science of economics in like 1935

01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:03.280
And you know somebody who knows somebody who knows like Felix Frankfurter or Tommy Corcoran or something

01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:09.520
And so you're like make some inquiries and one day you get a call and the voice on the telephone

01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:13.040
it's like would you like to come to Washington and

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:19.360
You know work for us and you're like what what would I be doing and the voice will be like we'll figure it out

01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:26.240
You know and you get there and you get in an office and your boss is like here's three million dollars go electrify arkansas

01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:31.280
Right, you know and that same person like 80 years later like their existence is

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:35.600
They're basically a tracy flick, you know the the great film election

01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:37.040
um

01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:40.160
Alexander pain film from like 25 years ago or so

01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:42.800
Reese Witherspoon

01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:44.560
High school student government, right?

01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:49.440
You know, so you're like tracy flick and your goal is to get ahead in everything and be like a goody-goody

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.680
And you're on the high school newspaper and you go to Harvard and you know

01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:56.240
study political science

01:44:56.320 --> 01:45:02.080
And then you're like I want to go to Washington. Okay. I'm gonna like intern for like

01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:07.120
A house member doing like a constituent service and like, you know after a while

01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:12.960
They might let me talk to the lobbyists who writes the legislation and you'd be like see here's a line of legislation

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:15.520
I took care of for that. It wouldn't say that if I hadn't been there

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:21.440
You didn't write it you got it from the right lobbyist or activist or whatever, right, you know, and so basically

01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:24.400
This is a very saturated system

01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:31.280
In terms of its ability to offer the things to ambitious people that ambitious people

01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:33.520
They need a

01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:38.160
similar simulacra of power, but you don't actually do anything you don't get three million dollars to electrify

01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:45.600
Yeah, and if you actually do something it's because you work really hard to get a bunch of status

01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:49.920
And then after you got that status you've got some real actual power

01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:52.800
and

01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:56.480
You know, yeah, it's like a really um

01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:02.160
It's like it's really grueling and it rewards like people who are not

01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:08.080
As imaginative and talented like people who are really imaginative talented want to it, right?

01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:16.560
And because it fucking sucks, you know, and and so you have like sort of all of these things are kind of

01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:23.040
ripe for something different in a way and like one way to think about

01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:27.920
Sort of the way that something different exists is to think about

01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:30.560
Or to sort of

01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:39.280
Define the different thing that you want to exist is to think about sort of how it should think about what we have at present

01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:41.840
How does the new regime think about the old regime?

01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:50.080
What does basically the soviet union in 1987 look like from the perspective of russia in 1997?

01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:55.280
How you look back on the old regime and it shouldn't be like oh man, I miss the old regime

01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:59.840
Wow, they could really get that shit done now our garbage doesn't get picked up. It should not be like that

01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:03.040
It should be the opposite of that, right? And so, you know

01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:05.840
if you're looking

01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:08.160
at like

01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:09.600
I mean

01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:10.960
sort of the old

01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:14.000
america from the perspective of an america where

01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:20.000
Even just basic things like you can walk safely anywhere any time of day or night, right?

01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:23.280
You know, think about how impossible it is would be to get that

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:31.840
Basic simple feature of like the government monopoly on violence back, right? You know and and like speaking from the west coast

01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:33.680
I mean, we're kind of like

01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:39.200
Yeah, yeah experiencing class here. Portland. Did you say portland? Yeah, portland and seattle olympia

01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:43.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Sure. Sure. I've seen it all right

01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:49.120
And you're saying you're saying to get back to my first question the opportunity or the the

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:56.400
The this regime is is selecting for madness on a number of different levels and then also selecting for people who have

01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:01.760
Lot lack of talent or imagination because they would probably just want to be in a startup

01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:04.480
um to begin with

01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:06.720
So this new uh

01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:13.280
Era or new field will select for itself the leader that has the qualities that would maximize that

01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:18.800
Yeah, I mean, I think that really people underrate the extent to which

01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:24.880
sort of the structure determines the ideologies and the virtues and so

01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:27.760
basically

01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:29.920
any sort of

01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:31.920
monarchy at all would basically

01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:35.120
See that sort of bringing this like

01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:37.760
Sort of, you know, you know how hercules

01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:42.720
Sends the river into the audience tables, right? You know, uh, he he has

01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:48.160
You know in the myth of hercules. He has all these impossible tasks to do which he does in these impossible ways

01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:53.280
He's like i'm gonna clean out the dirtiest stables in the world. So like let's redirect river through it, right?

01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:55.760
you know and and sending

01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:57.840
like

01:48:57.840 --> 01:48:59.840
it's hard the sort of the

01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:02.400
course of like

01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:06.320
kind of healing and repair in that sense that

01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:11.520
Would be the obvious course for any monarch seems to me

01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:13.520
like

01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:17.920
If you took like j random ceo and made him king

01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:22.000
They'd probably are ceo of washington or you know

01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:30.320
Imperial president or whatever they'd probably mostly come out with the same kinds of things. I think it's definitely

01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:32.720
sort of like

01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:33.680
What is my role?

01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:37.120
My role is to sort of write the buck on how to do this, right?

01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:40.720
Which will I hope help it become more possible

01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:47.680
You courtesy arvin. That's your courtesy arvin. You know, my role is definitely not to be king of a possible pick of monarchy

01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:52.960
I'm a terrible. Sorry about that. I'm a terrible ceo. I've been a ceo. I'm awful at it. You really don't

01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:59.280
But i'm a more of a the priest type than the within the warrior type but

01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:06.080
But yeah, I mean like having that blueprint certainly helps or should help a great deal

01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:09.120
To make it possible. But yeah

01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:11.360
the political formulation

01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:13.520
the pre pre formulation

01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:16.640
Yeah, the you know the like why would you

01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:19.840
Yeah, the sort of the

01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:24.240
You have to have something both that is a plan that could be followed

01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:26.960
and a plan that people can believe in

01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:29.200
and

01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:33.360
You know and that that belief is going to strike people is extremely on but like

01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:39.920
America is the land of propagandizing on beliefs and you know, imagine, you know, sure

01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:42.080
I mean imagine how like

01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:44.240
Imagine what people would have thought of punk

01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:51.360
In 1963 and now the brits are going to get mad because they're going to say they invented punk. Yeah. Well, the americans

01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:57.280
Maybe but I imagine what the brits would have thought of punk in 1963. All right. Well, I should probably

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.440
We've been a while on on the last questions and yeah, well, no

01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:03.520
I just want to plug your your uh, your

01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:09.840
