640	5760	Benjamin sent me homework last night to read one of your articles and I may actually do a podcast
5760	11440	based on the article at some point. Which one was that? Which one is it, Benjamin? It's your
11440	16720	five flaws with liberal philosophy. Oh, the false assumptions, yeah. Yes, the five false
16720	25520	assumptions. I think that's a very important piece, honestly. So, yeah. I'm working on a follow-up
25600	30400	today, actually, because I've identified at least four more false assumptions in liberalism,
31600	35840	which, unfortunately, it's one of the problems of it. It's just it's
36720	40960	kind of irreconcilable for the philosophy and I'm not happy to say that, you know.
41760	46320	Right. Yeah, I mean, I think about these things a lot because this was
47200	55920	a philosophy that was hashed out over 200 years ago when, I mean, we're getting a lot of trouble
55920	59680	for saying this because there's a lot of old wisdom and things, but frankly, people didn't
59680	68000	know what the hell was going on. And liberalism falls out of the enlightenment and the enlightenment
68000	74720	is this sprawling, messy kind of quest of discovery and, you know, the scientific,
75440	80480	the dawning of the scientific revolution is kind of beginning, but science doesn't mature until the
80480	89120	early 20th century, certainly until at least electromagnetism is tamed, which is early 20th
89120	97200	century. Quantum mechanics throws a wrench into the whole thing later, but you have this kind of
97280	104160	unfolding of ideas where people are making sort of stabs in the dark and there's this kind of,
105600	114800	I don't know, almost miasma of deep philosophical thought mixed in with literal mysticism mixed
114800	122480	in with religion and trying to cut apart from these things all at once, where people, again,
122560	127760	I mean, like, you know, with the Five False Assumptions essay that you wrote, you talk again
127760	132320	and again about this root of this kind of being in this image of the state of nature,
133120	141440	which is, of course, just crap. No such thing ever existed. No such thing applies whatsoever,
141440	148000	again. A bunch of them admit that it's probably not true as well. Right, which is even funnier.
148000	151840	Yeah, why base anything on something you probably think is not true? Why do that?
153280	158400	Because humans, I mean, what do you mean exactly? But yeah, it's just fantastic
159360	164320	to look at this, because my opinion, and maybe you agree with me, and maybe you don't agree with me,
165040	172960	and maybe you hope I'm right, is that there is, if we might lift language from Karl Marx,
172960	177520	just for the hell of it, that there is a rational kernel in this mystical shell that can be pulled
177520	185920	out and updated for the 21st century. I think that these assumptions poke at something true
185920	190880	and valuable. I know that you have identified yourself, and I identify myself as classically
190880	195840	liberal in many regards. I don't know if that still holds for you for sure, but with your
195840	202960	your desire not for those, those things should not be the case over there. I feel like there's
203280	208720	a post liberal at this point. It's not that I don't owe anything to the legacy of liberalism.
209440	214960	I feel that it's time to figure out what was true and what was not, and then what to keep and what
214960	221680	to lose. So in that sense, I don't know that our project is wholly different, except that what I
221680	231680	would rather do is put the truth of those insights that are based on incorrect assumptions on
231680	237120	firmer ground and update them for the 21st century and the circumstances we find ourselves in.
238240	242640	That's something we can definitely discuss. Definitely something we can discuss.
242640	248000	Where would one begin? Because both of you guys have attacked very thoroughly in your own ways,
248000	256320	progressivism, and then moving on to, as both of you, I've watched you guys develop your critiques.
256400	261840	You go deeper and deeper and deeper. And so where do we start after if we just say, okay,
261840	268640	we know that something's wrong. Society is fragmenting at the same time, power is congealing
268640	275280	in a way that doesn't seem to be good. And we want to have some sort of philosophy or some
275280	280720	sort of philosophical grounding from which to proceed towards organizing society.
280720	287920	So I'm seeing the situation that we're in. And then you and I spoke about this, I think after
287920	293680	we ended the stream last time, Benjamin, where we talked about the idea of what we're dealing with,
293680	299040	whether we call it communism or neo-communism or Marxism or this kind of legacy of Marxism or
299040	304240	woke or the kind of weird fascist thing that they built at the World Economic Forum in the United
304240	310240	Nations out of all of this and are applying it to us. I called it a parasite, a liberal parasite.
310240	315360	And I think that a lot of the post-liberal movement thinks that this is the culmination
316160	322000	of liberalism, whereas I think it is a parasite that has taken, that has slashed onto the side
323840	329360	of liberal philosophy and societal organization and has basically taken control of the ship.
329360	334640	It's like that beetle that went viral the other day with the parasites. It has no body left.
334640	340480	It's just the outer carapace of the beetle walking around literally like a janky beetle,
341120	346000	but there's no bot. The thing's not even just dead. It doesn't even have a body anymore. It's
346000	353120	been eaten literally apart from the inside. And I feel like that we have a parasite on liberalism
353120	360720	rather than a coming to fruit of what liberalism was always intended or likely to go to. And so
360800	364560	when I think about that, to switch metaphors, which I know is always a dangerous thing to do,
365440	372080	maybe more of like a garden, when does your garden get taken over by weeds? It doesn't get
372080	381120	taken over by weeds when the plant life, for example, is healthy and well-tended. And so that's
381120	389280	kind of, in my opinion, getting this basic philosophy right. If we want to get our basic
389280	394800	substrate to where it excludes the possibility of the parasite being able to latch on, but the
394800	400800	problem is the parasite's already latched on. Its fangs are deep, deep inside. It's already drained
400800	406960	most of the blood out of society. It's drinking what it can now very quickly of what's left.
406960	410800	And so we actually also have to kill the parasite. So what I see is we've got this
411680	421600	weird techno transhumanist future awful thing happening, being foisted on us by the exploitation
421600	427200	of being able to get around the kind of liberal government principles by using the corporate
427200	432720	sector to circumvent most of the protections that are supposed to be there. So we get this kind of
432720	439840	monstrosity. That has to be destroyed. I think that every sane person who wants freedom in the
439840	446160	future, whether we're liberal, conservative, post-liberal, whatever has to just focus on destroying
446160	452080	that, which includes the woke ideology. But we also have to figure out how to get this
452080	460000	fundamental philosophical substrate right in order to make sure that we don't easily get
460000	465360	reinfected. Or in fact, I hear a lot about creating parallel structures, parallel economy,
465440	471280	parallel this, parallel that. I think that that's interesting and a bit
473600	479680	ambitious and in a kind of fake way. But at the same time, how do you prevent such a thing from
479680	485120	being immediately co-opted by the parasite? And that becomes the question. Like I'm looking at
485120	488000	this school choice movement thing happening in the United States. And I'm just like,
489040	493680	you guys have done literally zero of the groundwork. This whole thing is going to be a woke
493760	498400	disaster in three years. The whole thing. Because you've done none of the groundwork to prevent
498400	502640	your alternative structure from getting taken over from the inside. This is a mistake the
503200	507360	reactionaries have made throughout the world. The integralist movement in South America made
507360	511040	this. They created all these powerful structures. They got their little helicopters. They got rid
511040	515920	of the communists. Everybody clapped and now look at South America. The whole place is going
515920	521120	communist full blast and using the apparatuses that they created in order to oppress people.
521920	530560	It doesn't work. It's not just making a parallel, but we have to also get the philosophy right.
531120	534640	And it has to be the philosophy updated in terms of what we've learned. So these five
534640	540240	false assumptions or the nine I guess now that Carl has identified of liberalism have to be
540240	545600	addressed. Those problems have to be identified and addressed. The philosophy has to be clarified
545600	549680	and updated. We have to figure out what liberalism actually was intending to achieve. Therefore,
549760	558800	clear it up and then at the same time destroy this beast. I mean, I use that in the biblical sense.
560320	566720	This beast that's consuming freedom and humanity. Not even civilization. Screwed civilization.
566720	572640	It's consuming humanity and it has to be stopped. So these are the things that I see as our big
572640	577680	project. But we've got to also get the philosophy right. The cultural renewal underneath the cause
577680	581920	of whatever human liberty looks like in the 21st century has to speak into not just what
581920	586560	we've learned that shows these nine errors, but what we also know and what we're dealing with,
586560	593360	the tech sector. The idea of a kind of literal ethereal world that we semi-live in through the
593360	600640	internet. Space and time are actually different. We don't need the queer theorists with their queer
600640	604960	space and time being the only people speaking into that. Are you suggesting that we create a
604960	608320	state of nature thought experiment for the internet? A state of virtuality?
608320	610720	Yeah, no. Absolutely not. Absolutely not.
612160	616560	Carl, what's your response to that? Or where would you like to focus on?
618960	625200	I think I actually do disagree with James on this. Sorry, James. I hate to be a
625200	631520	apologetic to disagree with me. I've got my anti-science aggression mug here for this.
631600	635520	I'm ready. Oh, good. Yes, because I'm the leading anti-science activist.
638000	647440	I think this probably was an inherent aspect of liberalism. It seems to be the enlightenment
647440	658560	itself is a movement dedicated to the supremacy of reason. That seems like a rational thing to have
658560	665360	in the 17th century when everyone is incredibly prejudiced, things are bad,
665360	670880	people are suffering all the time, and the human condition is far worse than what we have now.
670880	674720	But the thing is, I've come to the conclusion that ideas are a product of the time and place.
675760	681360	They don't just exist in the ether to be accessed at any point. They are a product of the human
681360	687840	experience, and we are living in a very different world now after 300 years of this supremacy of
687840	696320	reason. So much good has been done that we are forgetting, we have forgotten what good can be
696320	705520	done through ways of life that are not based on reason. In fact, much of our daily life is not
705520	711040	really based in reason. Most of it is based in habit, in custom, in prejudice. I don't mean
711040	720400	prejudice in the way that the left would use it to describe bigotry, but the accrued wisdom of
721040	725760	habits is really what we mean by prejudice. We don't necessarily know. For example, I'm not
725760	732800	vaccinated. I don't know anything about vaccines, but I thought I would just be prudent on this and
732800	738400	not jump like everyone else. And learn, behold, I'm not worried about having a random heart attack.
739360	744160	It wasn't because I had any special knowledge or wisdom or insight. It was because
745280	749680	long, long experience has taught me that when everyone is moving in one direction and you're
749680	755040	not allowed to criticize or challenge that, there's something, there's something you need to know
755040	761120	about this. And that wasn't a product of reason. That was a product of my prejudice. And so it's
761120	764960	not that these things aren't valuable. It's not that they don't contain knowledge and wisdom,
764960	768960	and it's not that they aren't helpful. The problem is that prior to the enlightenment,
768960	775440	that was the dominant paradigm. And it was oppressive. And it was maintaining social orders
775440	781440	that people understood, rightly understood, to be intolerable and should have changed. And it's
781440	788240	good that they did. But I think that the pendulum has swung too far now. And it's normal and natural
788240	794480	for people who are committed to reason to stigmatize things like prejudices, things like
795040	800240	unthinking habits, biases. It's normal for them to do that, because that's what's in the way of
800240	806320	them achieving what they're trying to attain. But the problem, I think, that lies at the very root
806320	813360	of the enlightenment itself is it can't really stop itself from the way it is constituted in its
813360	820400	origins, from admitting that the ultimate goal of the enlightenment is to free the will from the
820400	827040	body. Because ultimately, it is the physical necessity of being a human being that will forever
827040	833200	be inhibiting what the will is. And there's a massive conversation to go into about the
834400	839200	kind of circular nature of this as well. But I'll try and sidestep that just to save time.
842080	848000	We see this, as James points out, very, very honestly. This was probably, I think, one of the
848880	852160	insights, James, where I was watching one of your podcasts, and it just clicked for me,
852160	856480	if you'd described them as a Gnostic cult, and I was, you know, that is exactly right. Because I
856480	861360	read about Gnosticism when I was studying the Cathars. And I'd never made the connection before,
861360	865840	and you would spot on. But that's exactly the problem, isn't it? It's the stigmatization of the
865840	870400	material world that is the issue. And then I watched a podcast that Michael Knowles did with a
871680	877520	science-based medical student. And he just drilled it down at the end to her saying, well,
878080	881600	he was like, well, this is your body, then what's you? And she's like, well, it's my soul. So,
881600	887360	oh my God, okay. So now we have arrived at the Gnostic position, where the soul proceeds the body.
887360	892160	Now, I'm an atheist. So I don't believe that at all. I believe that the mind is a product of the
892160	896640	body. And in fact, the mind is not separate from the body. It is a part of the body. And so,
897920	905200	I think this is where we can properly begin to see where the Enlightenment actually has this
905200	910480	fundamental flaw in it. And how we can begin, like I said to James just before we started,
910480	914560	I consider myself these days sort of a post-liberal. My instincts are, of course,
914560	918560	as they've always been, and I'm still very classically liberal in what I would choose for
918560	924000	myself. But as I noted in those articles, there are false assumptions that liberalism is built on.
924000	931040	And if you are forced to build an intellectual foundation that is consistent and accurate to
931040	934400	reality, which not everyone is, I mean, you could have a mythological foundation,
934400	938720	which lots of people do. And that's not necessarily bad either. That's another conversation.
939600	946640	Then we have to ascertain what the real situation was, and as you pointed out, James,
947200	950960	they were doing their best 300 years ago. But of course, there's just so much more that we know
950960	959040	now, thanks to the use of reason. So the core thing for me is to actually stitch back together
959600	964880	reason and our physical bodies. This is something I think actually needs to happen.
964880	965920	In tradition too.
966720	971440	Well, that's the point. Almost everything physical you do is kind of a tradition. It's
971440	974880	kind of part of a tradition. You get up every morning and you get your breakfast and you
974880	978560	don't think, well, you can have breakfast. What do I feel like? And on a Thursday,
978560	981840	you might feel like a fry up or something. I don't know. But you make your breakfast,
981840	985680	you don't really think about it. It's just something you do. And this is the habitual
985680	993120	patterns of life. This is most of what we do. And it's okay that that is unreasoned. It's okay
993120	997440	that most of our life is actually kind of impulsive, as Jonathan Heitzwerk has gone through,
997440	1001680	and we've known as far back as human. Actually, most of what we do isn't
1001680	1006000	rationalized. Most of what we do is post hoc rationalization for what we've just done,
1006000	1012720	because habitually, we've always done it. And so the remarriage of these things
1012720	1020160	is an important thing. But what I think that does is actually to destroy the concept of ideology
1020160	1027280	itself. And that's a problem for ideologists. And ideologists are mostly, as far as I can tell,
1028160	1032000	a product of the Enlightenment. I think you could make an argument that Islam is a form of
1032000	1038560	political ideology that came obviously long before. But what do you mean by ideology? Like a
1038560	1044160	ruling co-herit? So there are lots of definitions of ideology, and no one seems to be able to nail
1044160	1048880	them down. But a few that I've been working with, one of them comes from critical race theory,
1048880	1054960	actually, which is a set of contested ideas. And the second one is from Oak Shots, where it's
1056160	1061680	the distillation and abstraction of a political tradition that is used in order to justify the
1061680	1066800	seizure of power. And actually, I think that one, combined with the other one, but that one is the
1066800	1074800	most accurate because an ideology is essentially programming code for political NPCs, for midwits,
1074800	1081200	to tell them, oh, no, if you do this, this, and this, you should get X or Y result. And now,
1081200	1085840	I mean, we know that this just generally isn't true for most ideologies, because the world is
1085840	1094560	horrifically complex. But it is the retreat out of, I should say the advance out of this
1094960	1101360	scholarly place into a more real place, where we're approaching the sort of more Edmund
1101360	1106400	Burkean position of, yes, I'm a wig, yes, I'm all these things. But I also think the traditions are
1106400	1113600	important. To kind of marry these things back together, I think is actually the job of post-liberals,
1114160	1119840	because we don't want to lose the good things that liberalism provided to us. But we also don't
1119840	1123840	want those things weaponized against us. And when you're existing purely in the world of theory,
1124320	1129120	actually, that's entirely possible, as James and I have both spent a lot of time explaining through
1129120	1136400	critical race theory. It's actually an attack on the liberal view of civil rights that birthed
1136400	1142960	critical race theory and has allowed it to prosper, because the parasite itself knows how we work.
1142960	1147280	And so it can do these things. And so we want to retain the good things that we
1148160	1154560	achieved without opening the door to radical extremism, like the critical race,
1154560	1161760	critical race theorists. And we also want to rehabilitate the authentically human dimensions
1161760	1166720	of being a human. Because one of the problems of reason is that we're looking at AI at the moment,
1166720	1171120	saying, okay, well, it's only a matter of time until this is effectively human, as far as we
1171120	1174960	can tell, because it's capable of reason. But I think that's the wrong way of looking at it,
1174960	1179680	because the constituency then, if it's a rational being, well, a lot of things could end up being
1179680	1185120	rational, but only one type of thing is a human. And that's the thing I think we need to be concerned
1185120	1190880	about, because we are all humans. And the human experience is very rich and very complicated.
1190880	1198480	And I think that we need to bring these things back together. And that means we need to, I think,
1198480	1205840	have a more sentimental view of ourselves, each other, and the sort of connective tissue between
1205840	1210720	each people, each person, that is the relationship that they have with one another, with the place
1210720	1215680	around them, with their own civilization, with their country, that any metaphysics that they
1215680	1223920	happen to hold. That I think is what needs to really be thought about, rather than trying to
1223920	1229200	continue on the path of ideology in order to try and defeat the woke virus. I mean,
1229200	1233840	I agree it needs to be defeated. But I think, actually, it's kind of a more advanced technology
1233840	1238640	in that regard. And so it'd be like trying to win the American Civil War with bows and arrows,
1238640	1244400	rather than rifles. I don't think you can do it. So I'll leave that there.
1244400	1253120	But a sentimental connection to each other can just as easily slip into a ideology or a formula
1253120	1258480	for acquiring political will, which is not necessarily bad, because we need to have some
1258480	1263120	sort of political will to protect society and some sort of unification within that.
1263120	1270880	But you see from the left, or at least from the elite, that any sort of disturbance of
1270880	1277360	a American nationalism freaks them out, or they continually prop it up as controlled opposition.
1278320	1286160	So just to make a point there, the problem with an ideology is defined a priori
1287360	1295680	from a position that is not interested in what the world is like. And so it describes what it
1295680	1302240	wants in an idealistic way, and then tries to format the world to fit that. The difference
1302320	1309440	between that and this sentimental view of politics would be to take things as they are
1309440	1315200	and try and imagine a slightly better future, rather than reformat the entire world. So you
1315200	1321200	are localizing the issue that you're trying to change, rather than universalizing it, which is,
1321200	1324960	I think, the inherent problem with ideologies. Because you're starting in the realm of the
1324960	1329200	abstract and then coming into the real, rather than coming into the real, and then trying to
1329200	1333040	look slightly ahead. It works in different directions.
1334560	1339600	So on the topic of ideology, just to kind of put it out there, and maybe this will help you
1339600	1343120	since you're working on a project with it, Carl. I don't know if you've ever read,
1343120	1346960	you mentioned critical race theory. I don't know if you've ever read this book called,
1348080	1354160	what's it called, From Class to Race by Charles Mills.
1354400	1360880	And so the first chapter, I hesitated to read this thing forever, and I finally sucked it up
1360880	1367120	and read it. And the first chapter actually is Charles Mills, who's a very, he recently died,
1367120	1373120	like last year or something, or the year before. He's a very famous, I've been told I'm not
1373120	1376640	allowed to call him a critical race theorist, because he's a critical philosopher of race,
1376640	1380240	and we can all go off in our leftist circles and jerk around or whatever we do in them.
1380400	1389360	But anyway, the first chapter, he basically lays out literally a claim that everybody who's
1389360	1395680	a Marxist ever misunderstood Marx about ideology. And he gives the most cogent explanation of what
1395680	1400560	it is that I think I've ever read. It's one of the most valuable chapters I've ever read in my life,
1400560	1406160	I think. And what he mostly is doing is taking apart other Marxists and saying how inadequate
1406160	1415120	they are, which is, for me, just great. But the definition kind of boils down to that it is the
1415120	1423280	mythology, that the ruling class kind of semi organically, but sometimes deliberately weaves
1423280	1432640	in order to justify, maintain, and entrench its own power. And so it is a political mythology.
1432640	1437360	And the reason I think that we see this rising within the Enlightenment is not specifically
1437360	1442800	because of something to do with the Enlightenment, although perhaps I'm open to the contention,
1443680	1450960	to the hypothesis. What I see happening in this regard is that the, when you said that it clicked
1450960	1455440	with you with the Gnosticism, I think that what we saw is that the kind of Gnostic architects
1456640	1461200	that were kind of operating in parallel, and not even in parallel, literally mixed in,
1461200	1466400	I said miasma earlier, and I really mean it. There was no real distinction between mystics and
1466400	1471680	scientists and philosophers, and even theologians sort of throughout Europe in the late Middle
1471680	1476240	Ages, early modern period. There just wasn't Francis Bacon, which one was he, all of them.
1476240	1483600	So what are you going to do? Newton, several of them at once, you go to the Swabian pietist the
1483600	1489520	theologians from which Hegel and Marx derive several at once. What do you, I mean, it's just
1489520	1494000	mixed together. This is the problem with thinking from three, four hundred years ago,
1494000	1501600	is we hadn't clarified some of these things. And so what I see there is that the Gnostic
1501600	1509600	project got moved into politics, sociology and economics very deliberately. And the reason
1509600	1514800	I actually say that Hegel is the one who codified this, I don't think it's his doing.
1514800	1520880	We might blame Kant. We could definitely blame Rousseau, who I fear you sound a little bit like
1522080	1527360	at this point. I'm very, very familiar with Rousseau. And so I can explain why I'm not.
1528320	1532320	I'm nervous that the project you've outlined attends in the Rousseauian direction,
1533520	1539680	without some guardrails at least, the sentimentality, the, you know, attempt to get back to sensuousness
1540480	1546480	as a meaning, as a basis for understanding reality. But I don't disagree with you about
1546480	1550880	the body being the center of our experience and the mind. I'm all, you know, I'm also famously
1550880	1556800	an atheist, aka America's top Christian nationalist, but that's my other Christian nationalist.
1556800	1562400	Oh, really? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Well, we're at the forefront of this movement that's definitely
1562400	1566960	not a Fed operation in the United States at all, like the most obvious one that's ever been created,
1567520	1572400	like watching them just jump into it. But no, what I see though, is that I see that the mysticism
1572400	1576880	got moved into politics, into the Rumble politics. And I think Hegel codified this with the phenomenology
1576880	1582480	of spirit. In fact, this is sort of the other day, believe it or not, I tweeted, I just spent half
1582480	1587200	my day reading Judith Butler, and it was surprisingly clarifying. First of all, I shocked
1587200	1592720	myself. I don't know if you've had the pleasure. I've read Jen to trouble. Yeah. Well, as you know,
1592720	1599600	it's a slightly painful book to read. Didn't she win like first place or second place in like worst
1599600	1604160	sentence ever contest or the worst writing ever or something? I don't know. I wouldn't be surprised
1604160	1608800	if she did. I can sit down and read Judith Butler straight through like it's not that hard now.
1608800	1614640	Are you found out the Judith code? Well, I just know what the words mean and how they construct
1614640	1618960	sentences. So it's really not that complicated. I read I had the same thing with that was
1619920	1627200	the dialectic of sex. I can't remember. Oh, yeah, that one. Yeah. That was the first
1627200	1631920	principle theory books I was going to I tried to read. Total gibberish after about four years of
1631920	1636880	studying, I went back and reread it. I was like, I get this. Yeah, it took a long time. And Falstow
1636880	1642400	Sterling, that's who we're looking for on that one, I think. So anyway, I'm reading Judith
1642400	1645920	Butler and it finally clicks with me because she's got this whole thing. I'm kind of like
1646880	1650400	blowing my load too early here talking about this because I want to talk I want to do my own
1650400	1657760	podcast about this issue. But she's deriving this quote from Foucault, where Foucault, of course,
1657760	1661760	you know, these fucking French guys. So what are these post monitors? What does he do? Well,
1661760	1665920	it's not that the some very with the Gnostic concept, right? It's not that the body is the
1665920	1670560	prison for the soul. It's the soul is the prison for the body. That's Foucault. That's a literal
1670560	1675440	statement from Foucault. Judith Butler brings it up repeatedly throughout her writing. It's
1675440	1680240	mentioned in some other kind of foundational queer texts. So this is an important concept. And of
1680240	1684080	course, you read it and you're like, that makes zero sense whatsoever. How is the soul the prison
1684080	1689280	for the body? And what you realize is that what I'm saying when Hegel codified, what I'm seeing in
1689280	1695040	this transition to modern mysticism or modern Gnosticism, modern era Gnosticism is which is,
1695040	1701440	by the way, what Marxism kind of distills and it makes actionable. He becomes like the grand
1701440	1708000	priest of this is how you do modern Gnosticism. What Hegel codified is that the social constructions
1708000	1713680	are the spirit. So the social construction of society around you, which you're trying to manipulate
1713680	1720080	by either manipulating the idea or the material conditions, the the the the geist of society
1720720	1725600	is the spirit. But that's that I mean, literally, that's what the word means phenomenology
1725600	1732160	disguises. That's what the word means. So it's a spirit. And your soul is as a person, just part
1732160	1737680	of that spirit, which is on the trajectory of transformation of of history. And so you are
1737680	1743120	a part of that greater spiritual whole, your soul, whatever that represents is therefore your
1743120	1747280	understanding of yourself through the social constructions of reality. And thus the soul,
1747920	1752400	which is the social constructions of reality applied to you becomes the prison for your body.
1752400	1756000	So you're born with a weenie and the social constructions of what it means to be a man
1756000	1760880	imprison you because of your body. So your body is imprisoned because I'm like, oh,
1760880	1765920	shit, that's what she means. That's what Foucault means. The social constructions become the
1765920	1772240	artifice of the prison of the Gnostic line of thought in the modern going into postmodern
1772240	1780560	era. I do like this idea of it being a superior technology to have exploited this phenomenon.
1780560	1784800	But what you're seeing is simultaneously, we always talk about like the enlightenment,
1784800	1788160	and then there's a counter enlightenment, right? And of course, we got Stephen Hicks,
1788160	1791840	brilliant guy. I don't know if you've ever met him. He's fun to be around, actually.
1791840	1795760	Spoken to many times. Yeah, I like Stephen quite a lot. And Stephen's got his wonderful book,
1795760	1800240	what, back from 2005. So we're talking a while ago explaining postmodernism,
1800240	1806240	and he's talking about the counter enlightenment. And he's approvingly interacted with stuff I've
1806240	1809760	said to this, but I haven't spoken with him about it yet. I actually should call him and
1809760	1814640	talk to him. You definitely should. I mean, we've talked many times. We actually went to
1814640	1820320	the beach together for like a week. It was kind of fun. But I don't think there was a
1820320	1825840	counter enlightenment. I think there were two. I think there was the religious reaction to the
1825840	1830400	enlightenment. And then there was the romantic reaction to the enlightenment. And I don't think
1830400	1836960	that these two things are perfectly separable, right? Again, that mixture of enlightenment
1836960	1841200	thought, religious thought, and then mystical thought or Gnostic thought, all kind of blended
1841200	1846720	together in this. There was no distillation of these kind of three alchemical ingredients.
1846720	1853360	And the romantic reaction, this is where when I start hearing sentimental and during a Purse.
1853360	1856800	So maybe I should have chosen my words more carefully. I'll explain in a minute.
1856800	1859520	That's fine. That's fine. And I'm not putting you on the spot. I'm just no, no, no, no,
1859520	1863680	I just reacting as I go. But the romantic reaction is,
1864000	1869680	is so if we think of the religious reaction to the enlightenment as the ability to carve out
1869680	1875040	space for faith against reason, and there's a huge interesting discussion, I'm about to have a talk
1875040	1880960	I did in December come out today or tomorrow actually on this specific thing that I think
1880960	1885680	actually paints a way forward that might tap into something you really like. If we think of the
1885680	1891200	religious reaction as carving out against reason space for faith, I think of the romantic reaction
1891200	1899680	as carving out against reason space for mysticism and mythopoiesis. And I think that's poison,
1899680	1905280	and that's where the parasite lives. And so the space forward for me looks like, how do we get
1905280	1910640	faith and reason? For me, the magic sauce of the West, Ben Shapiro touches it in his, I forget
1910640	1915760	which book it is, he writes a book like every 15 minutes. You know, he writes at the same speed,
1915760	1923920	he talks. And so very far behind him. I'm trying to catch up. I'm training. I'm training. I got
1923920	1929920	an energy drink in my Hotez mad cup over here. I don't have coffee or tea in it. But no, what he
1929920	1936720	says is that it's somehow Athens plus Jerusalem, right? And so what is that emblematically, that's
1936720	1942080	kind of an archetype of reason that's Athens and an archetype of faith that's Jerusalem,
1942080	1949440	and also tradition, the Jewish tradition. I mean, Hanukkah, you eat fried food because 5,000 years
1949440	1954400	ago, they didn't run out of oil one day. Like, that's tradition. Like, you can't beat tradition to
1954400	1960000	that level, right? And so the idea of those things coming together to box out mysticism
1960000	1964880	is I think what's made the West so successful. But we've had this weird undercurrent of mysticism,
1964880	1970080	and sometimes just main current, we can't deny that there were masons involved in the founding
1970080	1974080	of the United States and in the direction of its creation. What do you mean by mysticism?
1975040	1980960	I mean, these kind of Gnostic, esoteric and hermetic approaches to transforming reality.
1981680	1988480	But it's similar to affecting your will upon reality, or some sort of process.
1988480	1993440	It's the ability to believe that you can project your will forward into reality and make your will
1993440	1998480	come to be in reality, which is the realm where ideology lives. In fact, it's in a sense what
1998480	2004960	ideology as Carl was describing it. It's what it exists to do, that you put your idea out first.
2005680	2010800	And then what you do, ironically, almost is you pretend that science, you pretend that you've
2010800	2016560	put out the hypothesis, and then you check against reality to tweak your hypothesis to keep going
2016560	2020480	forward. But in fact, really, what you're doing is you're bending circumstances to make your
2020480	2024880	hypothesis come true, and you never allowed to be falsified. And that's the problem. And I say,
2024880	2028640	it's, and I'll let Carl talk and let you guys talk in a second, but just to bring it up,
2028640	2032480	we do have to go back when we start excavating the roots of this, and I brought up Athens,
2032480	2039440	we have to excavate deep, because when Plato names Sientia, that's what he's actually talking about
2039440	2045120	anyway. These guys, Sientia is broken down into two components. If you go read how he
2045120	2050480	organized it, you've got a piece to May, which is the higher level reason thinking,
2050480	2054880	and then you have the lower level of, you know, knowing stuff, understanding how the world works,
2054880	2060080	called Dianoya, that applies to Techne, which is Techne is the idea of gaining technical
2060080	2064720	knowledge to be able to do things in the world. So why is that relevant? Because how did it get
2064720	2069760	into this story that I'm telling? Well, it's not even that mysterious, there's pretty good
2069760	2076240	evidence out there that Hegel just imported that architecture from Plato, which is to build a
2076240	2080400	technocracy. That's what, if you read Republic, that's what he's describing, is a technocracy.
2081360	2088240	That's the technology to build a technocracy on. The episteme is the higher level reason of the
2088240	2093280	philosopher kings who are going to guide the knowledge to the point of, wherever the ideology
2093280	2097680	points that they've thought up, their philosophy that they thought up a priori from the realm of
2097680	2102480	reason and the forms of how the world should be. And then Hegel just imports a shit and puts it
2102480	2108720	in German, calls them for numftim, for stand. And all of a sudden, he has this exact same program.
2108720	2116640	He updates it to early modern thinking or kind of late period. It's like the late end of early
2116640	2121040	modern, I don't know what they call that late early modern, because he's talking about, if you
2121040	2124880	read philosophy of right, he's talking about organizing a constitutional monarchy. If you
2124880	2131600	actually read it, you're like, wow, that looks like America with a king. And like, it's a lot of
2131600	2137200	the same stuff. Of course, America preceded Hegel in this, this was like 1821 or something like
2137200	2141920	that. He's writing this down. And so it's like divided powers, it sounds great, but you still
2141920	2147360	have this king. And this, you know, how it's in that, how's the king chosen, well, by the forces
2147360	2152160	of history and the conflict of opposites. And you know, all this nonsense that they're always into,
2152160	2157920	but he just imported the tech, the platonic technocracy with the concept of the platonic
2157920	2164400	epistome being the pathway to understand the ideology that guides the technocracy,
2164400	2170400	put it in German. And he actually becomes the guy who outlines the plan that Marx picks up and says,
2170960	2176240	actually, yeah, but flip it over so that we get to be on top as the grubs that don't do anything
2176240	2180880	and have an entitlement complex and hate everybody and don't take baths and stuff.
2181520	2185840	Let's take the program and flip it over so we win. But other than that,
2186560	2191760	yes. And the thing that's keeping this thing, this pyramid, the platonic pyramid of society upright
2192720	2198400	is the mythology called ideology that's understood in terms of they're in German,
2198400	2205920	they're fernund, the reason as it gets translated that guides the, the ideological program. And so
2205920	2211280	what did not to again put Carl on the spot because I actually like him. But when he says, you know,
2211280	2214960	this is the end of ideology, that's what Marx said he was building was the end of ideology.
2215600	2219680	But really what it was, of course, doing was he was forwarding his own ideology. So I'm not
2219680	2224160	saying this is what Carl's doing. Just everybody's clear. I'm saying that becomes a pitfall
2224960	2230880	of programs going forward that we must be very cautious about. And so for me,
2230880	2234960	I define liberalism and the Enlightenment very differently. I don't actually,
2235600	2238720	like I look back at these philosophers, these false assumptions, and I think,
2239520	2244560	aren't they adorable? That's great. But what I'm trying to find the essence under it.
2244560	2250160	And I think the essence under the liberal project is that none of us is God. That's it.
2250160	2254320	That's none of us has the power. None of us can become God. And that's retaining that human
2254320	2259600	thing you were speaking of. It also refutes the world economic form. Literally explicitly,
2259600	2265840	a homo deus coming from God, man coming from a Harari, him openly saying,
2265840	2270480	they are going to become gods and little see the arrogance of these people.
2270480	2275360	Look at him. He's gollum. He just hasn't turned ugly yet. Like he literally gollum.
2275360	2281760	And so he's got the ring. He's my precious. And humans are hackable animals, these people.
2281760	2285760	But it's that we're not God. And so how do we determine questions of things like political
2285760	2290640	authority? Who gets it? Well, the liberal answer in my opinion is, well, nobody deserves it.
2290640	2295760	So now we come up with a scheme to lend it to people with the consent of the people being
2295760	2300800	governed, et cetera, divided powers and all this. So I keep coming back to this and like Christians
2300800	2306160	tend to get pissed at me because I'm like distilling their Christian heritage of the nation or whatever.
2306160	2312000	But I actually think the fundamental assumption of this kind of broadly successful liberal project is
2312880	2316720	you're not God and you don't get to be God. In fact, that's true for everybody.
2316720	2324080	So you end up getting, you know, kind of a, we don't have obvious like physical equality.
2324080	2327760	Like some people are better at stuff, et cetera, or some people are bigger, some people are stronger,
2327760	2332800	some people are stupid, some people are whatever. We don't have that. But we, in terms of what it
2332800	2337920	means to have fundamental human dignity, there's a fundamental basis of equality because only God
2337920	2344000	in some sense has the authority to judge what somebody's human worth is. And since it's not,
2344000	2348160	it doesn't matter if God exists or not. All you have to say is none of us is that. So who has the
2348160	2353440	authority? And so what the whole liberal project does is it open for me is to open the door to
2353440	2360640	start trying to figure out how do we solve actual practical political problems under the assumption
2360640	2364960	that none of us gets to play God over anybody else? And it's not more complicated than that.
2365760	2371520	Everything else is details that flow downstream from this. Assumptions like the blank slate and
2371520	2379120	things are just frankly idiotic. Good try, John Locke, which thank you so much for your project,
2379120	2383440	especially for your articulation of the necessity of life, liberty, and property as
2383440	2390240	inalienable rights to secure liberty. But the blank slate, I mean, in the state of nature,
2390240	2394240	like, come on, guys, you can't blame him for his time, though, you know, you can understand why
2394240	2399200	you think of the state of nature thing. But yeah, he actually seems to have believed it as well.
2399760	2406080	Yeah, that's, that's, that's literally silly. Yeah, it is. And there's so much in John Locke
2406080	2413440	that is in one way genius and in the other way, obviously crackpot. And it does make me wonder,
2413440	2417600	but how old was he when he was writing this stuff? Because we often forget that a lot of these guys
2417600	2422880	were like in their 20s. Yeah, I would have to go back and check. I know he had to go into exile
2422880	2427760	after writing and he had to write it anonymously. Because what he was saying, he knew was insanely
2427760	2433520	radical. And this is actually one of the one of the sticks I used to beat the reactionaries now.
2433520	2438640	Well, like, well, this is, this is our version. And it's like, no, you are sitting in your house
2438640	2442880	that you own, and you're not worried about the state kicking down the door with you openly
2442880	2449040	espousing counter radical views. And so actually, we can say that liberalism has done good things.
2449040	2453440	And there are fruits of it that we'd like to harvest and keep. And so this is so many of these
2453440	2458480	guys that are telling me that they're ready for the war and that they practice on call of duty.
2458480	2463040	And like, they're not going to go to war, they're going to post memes to inflame it. And I'm like,
2463680	2470240	bro. Yeah. I have spoken to the, I went to a conference with them last year and I'm going to
2470240	2476000	get this year as well. So a lot of them are nice people, but just a bit online. And so essentially
2476000	2479120	my first explanation was that we're not, we're not revolutionaries. We're not going to, we're not
2479120	2483680	going to take up arms. Don't be silly. You know, none of you are. And that's fine. You don't have
2483680	2488400	to be, we can win this in other ways. Because in one sense, they have something that is true,
2488400	2494480	right? They have a good grasp on like the human, the genuinely sentimental, artistic human,
2494480	2498080	the aesthetic side of what it means to be a human. What, what makes life worth living?
2498080	2503120	Right. And that's what I think actually the enlightenment kind of doesn't have. And this
2503120	2508160	is what we need to start stitching back together. Because I agree with, by the way, great. In fact,
2508160	2513280	I think it's a, I think it's a feature, not a bug, but it leaves a massive hole. That's a problem.
2513280	2518960	Well, I, I, I... It's not just aesthetic. It's familial. It's family.
2518960	2525680	If we say aesthetic is in coming at the, having its origins in the sentiments, right? The,
2525680	2530000	the, what the, what an aesthetic experience is not something that's outside the world. It's
2530000	2533840	actually something that's within us. And it is playing on our sentiments, the environment plays
2533840	2539520	in our sentiments in order to make us feel in a particular way and have certain kinds of experiences.
2539520	2545680	And so the human experience is mostly aesthetic in that way. And so this, this is where I feel
2545680	2551520	actually we can say it's kind of the fault of the enlightenment. But when I say that, I'm not
2551520	2557200	saying, right, we need to jettison that because that's obviously irrational and silly because
2557200	2560960	so much good stuff came out of the alignment. We don't want to jettison the good things,
2560960	2565280	but we also don't want to be committed to the obvious absurdities. And James,
2565280	2572960	make a good point there. The, it is important and I, I swear to God, like it makes me laugh so hard
2572960	2578400	that it's too atheist saying, look, we need God. Okay. We need, we need to have that spot filled
2578400	2584720	because at the moment, look at the transhuman and transgender is I am God and I will remake my body
2584720	2588080	in my own image, right? It's like, no, you're not, you're, you're actually someone with a mental
2588080	2591760	illness. Okay. Right. I'm not trying to... And that's literally the hermetic thing, right?
2591760	2595760	Yes. It actually says at the point, you know, like the corpus hermeticum, like the poimondris
2595760	2600400	says that the point is to remember that you're God and then to become God. Yeah.
2600400	2607840	And exactly. And so we need to, we need to acknowledge that actually the problem with
2607840	2614240	reason alone is that it thinks, of course, it processes the world in abstractions and
2614880	2621280	it categorizes the world. And that's actually the opposite of, I think, how the aesthetic world
2621920	2626880	exists. And so we need to find a way of reconciling these things because, so look,
2626880	2630800	picking up on your point on Rousseau, I, now that after you said it, I thought, oh, how did he get
2630800	2635600	to that? But I kind of see how what I said could lead you to that point. But it's actually the
2635600	2639200	opposite of where I'm trying to go with this. Because so one of the, one of the good things
2639200	2644160	about liberalism is its individuality. It's individualism. It is a good thing to treat
2644160	2651600	a person as some, a cause in and of themselves and as something that is perfect and not a perfect,
2651600	2659280	sorry, worthy and unique, right? So yeah, sacred. Yeah, sacred is the right word. Now,
2659280	2666800	the problem with liberalism is that it can treat every person as something. However,
2667520	2673680	the problem it has is the categorization, the, essentially, it's the epistemology and ontology
2673680	2680400	of it, where it has to reduce each human being to the universal shared characteristics. And so
2680400	2687280	actually you're kind of reducing all of those differences, the human qualities, the detritus
2687280	2691600	of tradition that builds up in people. For example, my accent is one example. It's not a universal
2691680	2696560	accent. It's an English accent. And so we'd have to subtract that in our analysis of how
2696560	2701440	the three of us are all human. And so we have to slowly whittle away those things that actually
2701440	2706240	make us uniquely us in order to get to the universal man, which again is another false
2706240	2711120	assumption of liberalism. There never was one in order to say right now I have a conception of
2711120	2715120	every individual human person. Because of course, the universal thing is also an individual thing,
2715120	2720240	because it means everyone. And that's actually, I think the wrong way to go about it because
2720960	2726240	we do want to be concerned with the individual, but we don't want to reduce the individual to a mere
2727600	2732720	fungible item that is something that could be produced in an assembly line.
2732720	2737360	Just something like where we would make a new kind of style of art where we put nobody's face,
2737360	2744080	but just maybe what color exactly think of the representation of signs of the crosswalk signs
2744080	2748160	and things like that. It's a universal human shape, you know, so you know, it's meant to represent
2748160	2755120	a human, but no particular human. And that's where I think the problem of not just Rousseau,
2755120	2762000	but like Rousseau most embodies this problem, I think, where it's it's a generic universalized
2762000	2767200	human that has no commitments other than to the ideology in the state that propagates the ideology.
2768160	2774560	I find myself not having better language to use when I say, actually, I think the reverse is
2774560	2782000	necessary and we should have a more mythological view of people. So essentially, if we, and I'm
2782000	2787440	trying to take an aesthetic foundation to explain what I'm trying to get across here.
2788240	2794160	So you have to, I've not read anyone who's been able to articulate what I'm trying to articulate.
2794160	2802560	So if this comes across as clumsy, please forgive me. But essentially, we need to be able to frame
2802560	2808240	ourselves as the protagonists in a story, because every single person in a way is a protagonist in
2808240	2813440	a story. And the important thing about a protagonist is in a story is not that they are a universal
2813440	2818800	human, it's actually that they are a unique human, and they're an irreplaceable human, as in you can't
2818800	2824160	have Lord of the Rings without Aragorn, Gandalf, Gimli, Frodo and Sam. You can't just replace one
2824160	2829360	of those people, right? They are they are unique, and they will always be unique. And it's the
2829360	2833760	relationships that they have with the people around them, and the the events going forward,
2833760	2840800	and the moral, the overarching moral teleology of the thing that makes it what it is in a kind of
2840800	2848400	holistic way. And so these people don't just exist, they belong in this thing. And actually,
2849840	2854400	before the Enlightenment, and even afterwards, I suppose, that's how people kind of view the world.
2854400	2858240	That was the point of these stories. That was the point of telling the Iliad, that was the point
2858240	2864560	of reciting the Iliad in ancient Greece. That was the the characters are a unique and necessary
2864560	2868880	component of the story, in the same way that you and the people you love are in unique and
2868880	2873840	necessary component in your story, personally. And so now we've got away from the idea of
2873840	2878560	categorization. We don't have to interchange anything. We don't need a universal human.
2878560	2883920	Everyone is their own story. And actually, this gives us a much more human dimension,
2883920	2888080	because now we don't have to whittle away all of those differences. Actually,
2888080	2894880	the differences can be enriched and brought out and fully understood. And suddenly, you
2896480	2901440	find yourself being more empathetic to that person, because of their characteristics,
2901440	2906240	rather than to abstract groups, the oppressed or whoever it is. Because an individual, you can
2906240	2911840	say, look, I can see the suffering, I can empathize, if you know, you can put yourself in the shoes.
2911920	2917680	And this is, I think, a better way of conceiving of these things, and also allows us to bring
2917680	2924080	across the set of virtues that the Enlightenment identified and say, well, these are goods for
2924080	2928400	the individual that gives for the public, they're goods in general, we don't need to be committed
2928400	2936320	to false rationalistic foundations. And we can hopefully bring these things together and create
2936320	2941680	a world that actually we like living in, where we don't hate each other for arbitrary reasons.
2942240	2946880	And the only people that we would hate are people who have actually physically wronged us.
2947680	2952560	And even then, this is where Christianity comes into it, is let's talk about forgiveness and
2952560	2956320	reconciliation, justice. What do you think of that?
2956880	2961920	No, I actually think that this, I think I might be able to give you something to chew on that
2961920	2968560	might help you think about what you're thinking about. I don't disagree with this conception,
2969120	2974080	and the fact that this is how humans understand ourselves and each other in relationship to
2974080	2984080	each other, and that part of the problem is that in the search for universal man in the realm of
2984080	2991200	differences, like I made the interjection a moment ago about the interchangeable avatars of race,
2991200	2996080	gender, identity, et cetera, that is so characteristic of we'll call it diversity art,
2996640	3002640	which is a form of postmodern Soviet realism or socialist realism. I would actually say it's
3002640	3007920	socialist hyper realism if we're going to just incorporate into it. Well, I mean, it's very
3007920	3013680	good for corporatist marketing purposes and propaganda as well. But it's a form of socialist
3013680	3018720	hyper realism, this art form where everybody has no face, but you can tell what color their hair
3018720	3023120	and clothing tell you what gender they probably are, so they become avatars of identity. But
3023120	3029200	what this is, this is the search for identity in class, right? And so the other side of the coin,
3029200	3035040	and I'll come back to the the kind of storytelling thing in a moment, because I think that's
3035040	3041520	actually huge. And I think you are banging on a very important door, nothing to take away from
3041520	3048640	that, but it's something to add to it. But this other side of the universal man coin is the individual
3049280	3053120	and there are some, this is a fruit of the enlightenment that we are thinking of each
3053120	3058000	other or as each person as the individual, there's this weird tension and, you know, we dragged it
3058000	3063360	out in cynical theories and talked about it, that kind of if you think of it, that liberalism is
3063360	3069120	pointing toward the concept that there is something universal about mankind that makes us in a sense
3069120	3073840	sacred, but at the same time, we are at the end of the day, each individuals, and we can't forget
3073840	3078400	that. So we don't want to lose the fact that that is a fruit of enlightenment thinking. We're
3078400	3084880	not just, you know, peons under this Lord or serfs under that. We're not just members of this nation
3084880	3091120	or members of this church or this diocese or whatever else. We don't think of ourselves necessarily
3091120	3097760	just in terms of whatever class we've been assigned or cast, depending on how thoroughly
3097760	3103840	gnostic and monistic the circumstances are. There is a fundamental individual at the bottom of the
3103840	3109200	pile. And so that weird tension is key, I think, to enlightenment thinking. But what I was going
3109200	3114000	to point out, I don't know if you, not that I'm a giant fan of Daniel Kahneman by any means,
3114560	3118000	but I think there's something interesting. Actually, I don't like his expression of it,
3118000	3122640	as well as I like Joshua Green. So there's these two books. Daniel Kahneman is very famous,
3122640	3126480	Thinking Fast and Thinking Slow or something or Thinking Fast and Slow. I've heard of the book.
3126480	3133200	I've never read it though. Yeah. And so Joshua Green has a book called Moral Tribes and they both
3133200	3138800	present the same idea, although it's the point of Kahneman's book, it's not the point of Green's
3138800	3145440	book. But the idea is that there are basically two modes of human thought. One is we could call
3145440	3154080	Thinking Fast, one is thinking slow. Green gives a much, I think, more graspable metaphor for it,
3154080	3158960	which is a camera on automatic settings versus manual settings. A camera on automatic settings,
3158960	3165040	you pick it up, you take your picture, comes out good, never great, right? Or great by accident,
3165040	3170240	sometimes. However, you're sitting there twiddling the lens and on manual mode and you can get it
3170240	3176640	perfect. You can get the framing, the lighting, the lens, whatever. I'm good to focus. I'm looking
3176640	3180720	for words and I can't think of them. The bokeh, whatever the hell you want to get. No, no, I
3180720	3184240	totally get that. Exactly what we want on the manual settings and the automatic will never
3184240	3188560	quite do it. But the problem is, you've got to set up your shot. I have a friend who actually
3188560	3194240	used to be a professional still life photographer for commercials and stuff. He told me about this
3194240	3200000	one time where he spent literally every waking hour for a week taking a picture of a fucking bottle
3200000	3204160	of Coca-Cola. And the picture that came out is like, wow, that should be in a magazine because it
3204160	3209040	turns out that's what it was. But he ended up taking like, there's digital, so he ended up taking like
3209040	3214720	800 photographs of a bottle, tweaking the light, tweaking the light, and twisting the knobs and
3214720	3218880	everything that was like, you know, this bottle that's more real than real in the end. It's a
3218880	3224400	perfect photograph, right? And so that's manual mode. And so the reason I'm bringing this up is
3224400	3228960	our thinking fast mode, according to both of these guys is where we spend most of our time,
3228960	3235600	more than 90% of our time, almost all of our social time. We are not thinking rationally when we
3235600	3240080	are interacting with other humans, except to like hash out ideas, which is a philosophical
3240080	3245120	project. But in our normal like social interactions, how do we guess what we're going to do with the
3245120	3248720	person? You know, we're face to face, you say something, I have to respond and react. That's
3248720	3255200	all done in what they call intuitive thought or automatic mode on the camera. And it's therefore
3255200	3260400	done by heuristics, it's done by that weight of tradition, it's done by those kind of, you know,
3260400	3263760	either aesthetic or sentimental decisions that you just kind of make.
3265040	3268880	It's not rational, like you described, I don't make breakfast like you do,
3268880	3271360	apparently, but like you described making breakfast, right?
3272400	3278000	Would you just bring up Carl fry or something like that or fry up some thing nobody does.
3278720	3284320	Some probably involves a fish or some mashdown and bacon sausages.
3285040	3289680	God, I love sausages though. It's the only British sausage is British.
3290240	3295120	Thank God for you and your little kippers or whatever you call them. Yeah. So anyways,
3295120	3300160	the Cumberland sausages. That's so good. Yeah. Yeah. But so anyways, and it's funny,
3300160	3304800	I live in the Cumberland region of Tennessee, but so I'm all confused when I go to your island.
3304800	3308160	But you know, I've talked to Peter Rogosian now because I called it your island.
3308960	3314240	Yeah. Your small savage island nation where I was recently. It was beautiful.
3315520	3322400	The point being that we have two modes of thinking and that one of these discoveries since
3323360	3329440	John Locke or whoever you want to hold up as an avatar is that the intuitive mode of thought
3329440	3333200	is where we spend most of our time, do most of our social interaction, have most of our
3333200	3339520	experiences that we call human. But the thinking slow portion, the manual mode is where we have
3339520	3343440	to go and we have to get right answers about something important. And what we have to be
3343440	3349760	able to do is to tame that. And this is I think the essence of that enlightenment that we don't
3349760	3356000	want to lose that liberal project that we don't want to lose is we have to tame those intuitive
3356000	3360640	modes override them very often. Like for example, the impulse to want to be right,
3361440	3366320	which feeds into confirmation bias and these other biases where rather than going to
3366320	3371440	disconfirm our hypothesis, which is ultimately what mature science is about, we go to confirm our
3371440	3377520	hypothesis and thus create a mythology or an ideology for ourselves or around our concept.
3377520	3382080	Oh, you know, I think it's this guy's in cahoots with so-and-so and I'm going to go out of my way
3382080	3385840	to go find like every time he was ever in a picture with Bill Gates or something. So
3385840	3391440	that can prove that they were working together. So sometimes yes, sometimes no, sometimes whatever,
3391440	3399760	but you get me. And so the rational aspect, if we look at liberalism, and we kind of loosen
3399760	3404640	our grip on it a little bit, and rather than it being this, you know, age of reason that's reason
3404640	3410320	becomes the only in the gold standard, it's actually that reason has its domain, and that reason is
3410320	3421760	the corrective to the tribal class thinking very intuitive default mode. But we can't lose that
3421760	3425840	because that's the human. That's I think the space that we need to be working on, that there's this
3425840	3432640	very human intuitive approach, but that you kind of have to keep in the back of your head that
3432640	3436320	you're probably going to be for navigating daily life. Yeah, great, but you're probably going to
3436320	3440640	get the wrong answer when it matters nine times out of 10 if you live there, you're going to come
3440640	3447040	up with bullshit self gratifying self self justifying post hoc rationalization land.
3448960	3455440	And so there's this and not everybody spends like not everybody is a scientist in a sense,
3455440	3460720	they are but they aren't. Not everybody spends a lot of time in that. So it becomes that there's
3460720	3466000	almost these two domains. Are we living or are we trying to get right answers so that we can live
3466000	3472240	better? Right. And one of those requires tremendous discipline. And that's the ascension of reason.
3472240	3477360	So when I see liberalism again, I go back to this one axiom, which, whether you believe in God or
3477360	3481680	not, doesn't matter. It's we're not that we don't have omniscience, we don't have omnipotence, we
3481680	3487040	don't have perfect clarity and understanding of thought. And so what? And so what we have to do
3487840	3492000	is we have to be willing to recognize that we're limited and fallible. Christians like to call
3492000	3497760	it fallen. I don't need a story for why we're limited and fallible. I just think that we're not
3497760	3502320	as cool as we think we are and are not as smart as we think we are. In fact, I think I'm wrong
3502320	3507280	95% of the time and the 5% is pretty damn good. Twitter agrees with you on that, James.
3507840	3511280	Well, Twitter is wrong. It's a thing stopped by everyone. Twitter is wrong.
3511920	3517440	Literally. What did I say recently? I said that Twitter, it's like, oh, shit, what is it? This
3517440	3523840	is actually great. It's like upside down Cassandra, right? Cassandra is this myth where she sees the
3523840	3529360	future perfectly, but nobody believes her. But Twitter is like, it sees the present completely
3529360	3534720	wrong and everybody believes it all the time. It's like, it's like inverse Cassandra complex or
3534720	3539920	something. So anyway, I just think that we have to view liberalism as saying, listen,
3541120	3546640	your natural impulses are going to get it wrong when it matters a lot. So let's tame those. It's
3547120	3550480	I used to think that it was the ascendancy of reason. And then I started to think it's like,
3550480	3554320	maybe these guys thought humans aren't very good at this, but it's good when we
3554320	3562160	try to discipline ourselves for it. And that it became a corrective to our impulses to live in
3562160	3567920	thinking fast, even at times where we need to step into thinking slow. And again, I'm not endorsing
3567920	3573920	Conom and Conom's got his own issues. But I mean, anybody in the academic world that's propped up,
3573920	3577360	I think he's the second most cited author or something like that. Anybody's propped up that
3577360	3582640	far. Like that's one of my one of my little traditional heuristics these days is like you
3582640	3587360	said, if everybody's going in a direction with the vaccine, maybe he's great. I don't know. Maybe
3587360	3592560	this isn't a rational decision, but he's propped up something fake going on over here, right? Like
3592560	3598160	beware. But that concept though, that we have two modes of thinking intuitive and rational,
3598160	3602160	which in a sense is a mathematician, I'll say are artistic and mathematical.
3602800	3607680	I think there's even like this kind of like this is I'm bullshitting right now. Give me a minute.
3607680	3612160	But I remember reading something at some point that said that when we do mathematics,
3612160	3617440	because I'm a mathematician, it crossed my path. It's like you only have one math channel in your
3617440	3623200	brain unless you're John von Neumann or something. And so like if I tell you go ahead and like,
3623760	3628080	take the number 37 and square it in your head, your whole focus goes down one path and you
3628080	3633600	can't do anything else functionally while you do that because it eats up all of your Ram so to
3633600	3637840	speak to run down that path. But if I tell you to start thinking of artistic things, it's like
3637840	3642800	you're in like free association land in an instant, you're thinking a million things at once,
3642800	3648800	once I tap into that side. So these kind of very linear and very like explosive intuitive fluid
3648800	3654960	sides of thought. And I think that these and how long would it take you to square 37 in your head?
3654960	3661040	Like, if you're good at it, like 20 seconds, 30 seconds, if you're Arthur Benjamin, you can do
3661040	3667040	it speaking of all of our famous Benjamins, the math and magician. He he can do these things like up
3667040	3672400	to four digit numbers in like an instant. It's really impressive. But it takes a while because
3672400	3677840	that's a slow form of thought. And I think it's that when you need right answers to social questions
3677840	3683040	in the human experience, you need to dive into the intuitive. And when you need right answers
3683040	3688400	about hard detailed things that matter, you have to dive into the rational. And then wisdom becomes
3688400	3694000	like this capstone that helps you determine which realm you're in and when and which realm you need
3694000	3700960	as well. And and to purpose, right, to the circumstances. Yeah, like, I don't need to be
3702320	3707200	try to go be hyper rational with your wife. See how that works out for you. Yeah. Right. It's
3707200	3713600	sometimes it's just or you're two year old. Well, yeah, right. Just try it. Right. But you know,
3715920	3720480	tell your wife that she seems upset. And that's an irrational thing. See how it goes. You know,
3720480	3725520	it's like irrationality is going to multiply. There are times where you have to know which realm
3725520	3731440	you're in. And you don't need to like, if you're going to a party, a social engagement, a conference
3731440	3736560	or whatever, the after meet and greet, the reception, and you're like calculating and
3736560	3739280	triangulating who you're going to talk to and when you're going to talk to them and why you're
3739280	3745920	talking. First of all, you're spurting out. Stop it. And second of all, you're living. You're in
3745920	3750400	the reason mode when you need to be in the intuitive mode and you're you're missing something.
3750400	3757040	And I think that there's something gigantic here. I think that there is a huge temptation
3757040	3762480	within liberal enlightenment thought to put this primacy on reason, rather than putting reason
3762480	3768000	into the container where it goes, which is when we need to slow down and get right answers,
3768000	3772880	if somebody's got to have a surgery or something, we need to slow down and get right answers. But
3772880	3775920	if you're just trying to figure out how to make somebody feel better about the fact that they
3775920	3780080	need a surgery, it's not time to start doing calculations. It's time to sit down and put a
3780080	3785440	hand on their shoulder and be a human being with them. That's honestly exactly how I feel about
3785440	3793360	this. I can't help but be brought into mind of Aristotle when, really, he summarizes all as
3793360	3799200	the cardinal virtue of prudence, knowing when is a good time for what is literally the beginning
3799200	3807040	of all wisdom and the very first virtue. And with good reason, this is precisely how somehow
3807040	3812960	we've gone two and a half thousand years back to this exact place. Because we're in the same fight,
3812960	3819360	Carl. Exactly. The human condition never changed. And so very much when he's like,
3819360	3823440	man is a rational animal, I think that is the correct dichotomy about what a human being
3823440	3828880	really is in its essence. And it is that I think that the enlightenment has latched to the rational
3828880	3834160	side, and now it's come to a point where it's stigmatizing the animal side. And the animal
3834160	3839920	side will happily stigmatize the rational side if that's let alone to its own devices as well.
3839920	3843120	And so when you were saying how these things need to be in their proper place and use their
3843120	3850080	proper time, that's exactly right. And the problem that I think the rational side has
3850080	3854960	is that it can only work in the realm of theory, right? It can only think that's all it does. It's
3854960	3860640	rational. And so it can't help but categorize the world. But when you start categorizing things,
3860640	3866800	you are abstracting away from a real animal thing, a real solid thing in the real world.
3866800	3870160	And it's that where the beating heart is, it's that where the feelings are.
3870160	3874480	Right. I mean, this is what Hegel said about immediacy, right? You have to get to that. That's
3874480	3878480	what they're seeking. That's what the sentiment of Rousseau is, is looking for that immediacy,
3878480	3884320	that true experience, not just to interject. I'm not criticizing by bringing them up. I think
3884320	3890320	that they're the reason their project has been so successful at screwing up the world in such
3890320	3895760	horrible ways. French Revolution, anybody, Bolshevik, you know, the legacy is horrific
3895840	3899440	is because if that's tapping into something extraordinarily real.
3900000	3904320	Yes. It's something that resonates with people because there is a truth, a kernel of truth
3904320	3913600	embedded within it. And it is the issue, I think, is that we have allowed ourselves to pretend
3913600	3919520	the virtue can be done by thought rather than by action. And it is through the exercise of these
3919520	3924480	virtues that we become the kind of people that we have self-respect for and the kind of people that
3924480	3933600	we take on respect for others. And so the reason that I'm trying to get away from abstract categoricals
3933600	3938640	is because they've got this inherent dehumanizing effect. As soon as you start abstracting to more
3938640	3944640	than one person, then you necessarily have to start removing the human element to a degree
3944640	3951040	from whatever group you're trying to identify. And this is where I think this is where you
3951040	3956000	end up with the Holocaust. This is the logical endpoint where it's just a group. I don't know
3956000	3960320	any of them and they're all bad because I've calculated why they are bad. And actually,
3960320	3967120	that's just not real. You know, the reality is if there is a particular person who's done a particular
3967120	3973120	act that comes with it, a moral judgment that a sensible person would make, then you can take
3973120	3978080	action because that person is a criminal or a conspirator or something like this. You don't
3978080	3981840	just have this abstract category that you're applying to a bunch of people you've never
3981840	3987600	seen and you can't identify. And so it's this way of thinking that we need to find a way of
3987600	3994640	breaking past. So we can marry up the, and there's a very good way of describing it,
3994640	4001040	the slow and fast thinking, because it just genuinely represents the rational and the animal.
4001040	4006320	We need to have these married up. These just can't be separate ways and unique ways of looking at
4006320	4013200	the works. It just is not true. And it comes with significant price. It really does. And
4013200	4019280	we're watching it now. And the problem as well with the rational side of things is that, okay,
4019920	4025760	let's assume that everyone is a unique, is an independent sovereign will that is
4027280	4034320	in the flesh on this earth. Why? Why do they do anything? They don't know, you know? And so
4034400	4038880	not only is there a falsehood embedded within it that, okay, yeah, actually turns out that
4038880	4044960	all of your impulses aren't just the sovereign will of its own, making it, you know, in choices.
4044960	4049760	It's all biological impulses that are being translated into thoughts by your brain that you
4049760	4056080	desire, ultimately. But it also means you don't feel like you're attached to anything. And it's
4056080	4060000	these human attachments that we really need to start thinking about, especially in the modern era
4060000	4063520	where everyone's on social media and no one really feels attached to any of the people
4063600	4068240	that they actually live in. We're all parasocial in our entire experience.
4068800	4074000	Exactly. And it's giving us false senses of belonging. And that's actually really quite
4074000	4078880	terrible. And I'm just as guilty as anyone else of doing this. I'm totally guilty of doing this.
4079680	4086560	But the concept of belonging, what it's predicated on is that there is something
4086560	4092400	into which you could belong. And this is where the human side of the sentimental side of our
4092400	4098960	existence is withering away. It's genuinely a concern to me that people in Generation Z,
4098960	4105600	I see them talking to each other about things that they have no idea about. Like love,
4105600	4110320	they don't seem to understand the concept of romantic love. They have been conditioned
4110320	4117120	by the progressive millennials to view every interaction as transactional and not sentimental.
4117120	4121920	And so these people just don't understand what it's like to feel like they belong somewhere,
4122000	4128400	to feel like someone is uniquely related to them in some way. And it's horrific. And honestly,
4128400	4131920	I don't know if it's resolvable. I don't know if you can teach someone this
4131920	4136080	if they haven't been brought up in this way. I mean, I'm genuinely afraid of it, actually.
4136800	4142960	I'm a little more hopeful on that than it can be because of things, you know, growing up myself
4142960	4149120	and my own things I've overcome as I've matured into what I now believe is a fairly fruitful
4149120	4154080	adulthood. So I'm a little optimistic about that just to lay your fear. The thing is,
4154080	4158880	I don't disagree with you about what you're saying. I just don't lay the blame for it at the feet of
4158880	4163760	the Enlightenment because I go back to that emphasis on the individual that is also there
4164320	4172720	that is not present in the same way previously. And so that emphasis on individual, especially
4172720	4179840	individual rights, which thus defines the individual that enables, I mean, why did Locke say
4179840	4183600	life, liberty and property? Well, if you can't lock somebody up and you can't
4183600	4188480	set liberty and you can't kill them, that's life and property, you can't depose them of their ability
4188480	4192800	to feed, clothe and shelter themselves, then you have a hard time controlling their thoughts.
4192800	4197040	You have a hard time controlling their speech, which is like the expression of their thoughts.
4197040	4202080	And therefore they can be an individual. And in fact, being that he was a pious man,
4202080	4209840	they can pursue their belief in God without the strictures of a state or some other external power,
4209840	4216640	possibly condemning them to eternal torment because of what, you know, if you were that state,
4216640	4219680	you decided I have to believe about God. What if I'm right and you're wrong?
4220320	4224000	Being the kind of irresolvable question. And if none of us are God, none of us can answer that
4224000	4229040	question. So none of us has the right to impress that on each other. So this is the individual
4229600	4236080	is preserved in a unique way by the Enlightenment. But that there is there is a method of going too
4236080	4241760	far with it. But where I'm seeing, again, I really want to play this blame. And the Enlightenment
4241760	4247520	carries, as I mentioned, that miasma again, its own set of figures that I think that this is the
4247520	4252560	problem we have to figure how to resolve is the literally, and I mean this quite literally,
4252560	4257520	is the Gnostic thread that has run through the modern era into the postmodern that we've never
4257600	4263600	disentangled. Academics won't touch it. Nobody talks about it. But this idea of
4265440	4272480	this kind of hyper rationality is the Platonic episteme. This hyper rationality is the
4272480	4278000	fornumped this idea that are that we're going to lift up where you identify the problem. So now
4278000	4283280	we have two people and they become a group by default. And so we abstract, we have two opposites
4283280	4287280	and that are different, and we try to understand them in some kind of unifying whole. That's the
4287280	4291440	dialectic of Hegel. He even describes it in terms of apples at one point. They only have a green apple
4291440	4295600	or a yellow apple and a red apple. How are they the same? How can they both be the same? How do we
4295600	4302000	dare call them both apples? You know, this kind of thing, this categorization, the idea of obliterating
4302960	4310080	categories to arrive at immediacy is in fact, in my opinion, the Hermetic project,
4310080	4318480	which is a Gnostic project that is a huge danger swing and a miss from what, so when you keep
4318480	4322640	saying it's like, I'm like, you sound a little bit like Rousseau, you sound a little bit like Mark,
4322640	4324960	that sounds a little bit like Hegel, but you're like, but no, it's the other way.
4326000	4330560	And that's I think what we're getting at is that you want a non Gnostic approach to answering
4330560	4337760	the same questions that are there. And this is why I say that I don't feel a need to lay the
4337760	4343920	blame at the feet of the Enlightenment. I feel the need to lay the blame at the feet of this
4344560	4352160	esoteric thread that none of us have pulled out of that story yet. And then my thought is,
4352160	4356240	I actually like, you know, when you're talking about looking a little bit ahead or whatever,
4356240	4359600	I don't necessarily disagree. I'm not sure what to do with that yet. So I'm just not doing anything
4359600	4365920	with it. But I like the idea. I feel like liberalism properly construed and properly implemented
4365920	4370960	whatever that would mean. So what do I mean by that essential identification of the individual
4370960	4380400	and the human freedom secured, etc. Okay, allows for the organic evolution of society without
4380400	4386240	the selection pressures of, frankly, megalomaniacs stepping in and trying to determine which direction
4386240	4391520	things are going to go, which is the essence of what the lack of direction means that the megalomaniacs
4391520	4396080	and the psychopaths will rise to the top without a direction. How do you weed out?
4397360	4403280	I think I actually, sorry to interrupt, but I this, we seem to be a particularly interesting
4403280	4409360	point here because there's always direction, right? Direction is it comes from your personal
4409360	4413760	impulses as in what do we want? As in what do we not have? What do we want more of? You know,
4413760	4417360	what would be good for us? There's always direction, right? So I'm not worried about that
4417360	4421440	actually. And there are external pressures that are going to cause trouble that we have
4421440	4428640	to deal with. The thing that I want to talk about is the the Gnostic thread here, because
4430560	4438640	there's something about the privileging of reason that I think ends us at the point of
4440160	4446880	Descartes, where he essentially says, no, the will is the only thing I can be completely
4446880	4456080	sure exists. And everything follows from that. And I don't, you are right. I want a holistic
4456080	4463680	approach to the human being, right? The human being is both his body, his will, his experiences,
4463680	4472720	his memories, his stories, his like relationships, he is this full rounded thing. And the problem
4472800	4479120	of the enlightenment is I think the thread goes to that place where it thinks of itself as the
4479120	4483680	only legitimate thing. And I agree with you that there could be something we could call liberalism
4484640	4491280	that does have a holistic approach. But the way that the philosophy is constituted at the moment
4491280	4496800	and the emphasis it places on some things instead of other things leads us to a point
4497040	4503760	where we, I think, are always going to get the fangs of the parasite in us.
4503760	4505200	I think that may be true.
4505200	4512400	Whether we like or not. So this is why I'm interested in beginning at the place that
4512400	4520160	Aristotle found himself in, actually, and working from there. Because Aristotle believes that
4521200	4526000	all sort of hierarchy of these things, and they're all appropriate, none of them are stigmatized
4526000	4530000	in his view. And that actually seems like a more reasonable place to start to be. But sorry,
4530000	4530560	go on.
4530560	4535840	No, no, no, it's fine. I actually think that, again, I keep drawing back to this miasma thing.
4535840	4541680	It's so important to realize. So let's take Stephen Hicks, for example, and you read
4541680	4546480	explaining postmonarism. And of course, he absolutely blasts Russo as you should.
4547040	4553520	Yes. But then who does he kind of lay at the, who does he kind of like create as the character
4553520	4558320	who's sort of the problem, the universal problem that leads to postmonar, Kant, right?
4558320	4563840	So he makes Kant kind of this arch figure of the counter-enlightenment, right? So it's Kant,
4563840	4568400	an enlightenment figure or a counter-enlightenment figure. And you go into these online debates,
4568400	4572960	at least, or you talk to even philosophers who are professionals, and just watch them just like,
4572960	4577920	you're talking like cat fight, like, you know, is he an enlightenment figure or a counter-enlightment
4577920	4582400	figure? What this suggests is that there's something else going on. And one of my attempted
4582480	4586560	resolutions has been that there were two counter-enlightments. That's fine. But as a
4586560	4592320	matter of fact, these things aren't distinct. The miasma thing is a real problem. You had a
4592320	4598880	character like Hegel, who is doing certain enlightenment thinking, who is also explicitly,
4598880	4605440	unambiguously, proudly a mystic. He's just a fucking wizard. The dude's a sorcerer. He's not
4605440	4610240	even a philosopher, but he does some philosophy. He does some theology. He doesn't do any science.
4610240	4616160	Let's just not even lie. He's a shithead on that. But you have these characters that are kind of all
4616160	4619840	of these things at once. And so why is this thing that you just brought up? It's because there's
4619840	4625360	more than one definition of reason. That thing where, for Hegel, the word is for nymphed in German,
4625360	4629520	gets translated. I don't even know what that word means on its own, but it gets translated as reason
4629520	4636320	with a capital R when Hegel's rendered into English. Not reason with a lowercase R, reason with a
4636320	4642640	freaking capital R. And so now you have this same situation that you always end up with when you
4642640	4646480	have these, whether it's woke, whether it's Marxist, whether it's, what does democracy mean?
4646480	4650560	We'll ask a Marxist. It means you're under communism because everybody's equal. So everybody has
4650560	4654640	equal representation. Without that, it's not truly democracy. What does the people mean? Those people
4654640	4659120	who support the system? There's double meanings for all these things. I think that when we say
4659120	4664320	the enlightenment, there's not only just not one counter enlightenment, there's not even the
4664320	4671200	enlightenment. There's this kind of sprawling mess of different thinkers that you kind of can put in
4671200	4676480	and out at the same time. Kant being an enlightenment figure and a counter enlightenment figure of one
4676480	4681840	type or another, all at the same time. Hegel may be being all three at once. Rousseau, where's he?
4682480	4686080	Definitely some enlightenment ideas. Definitely informed some of these things that we call the
4686080	4692400	enlightenment. Also a blatant Gnostic. Man is born free and everywhere he's in chains. There is no
4692400	4699760	more Gnostic sentence than that other than I am a Gnostic. You put these things down and it's like
4699760	4704640	which one were these people? This is why I'm saying we haven't pulled this thread out. In fact, we
4704640	4710960	kind of have to rescue liberalism from the long train of Gnosticism that's been running through
4710960	4716800	it from its beginning because it grew out of the fusion of trying to mess around with the space for
4716800	4722480	reason, meaning two things at once. Faith, meaning maybe more than one thing at once.
4722480	4728320	And then mysticism, which is like, oh my gosh, guys, we can transform the world. Maybe we can
4728320	4733760	transform humans. What does that look like? I don't know. Let's get into some weird racicultism
4733760	4738240	and then put a bunch of Jews in ovens. That's where that ended. But that's racicultism and
4738240	4745200	this same idea that we can out reason what the world really is. And so that was a rambly thing
4746080	4751360	that boils down to I think that there are two definitions at least of reason that they have
4751360	4757520	threaded their way through the development that we're calling the enlightenment in that particular
4759120	4765840	meaning the word the that particular article there makes us blind to the fact that what we're
4765840	4772640	talking about is a much more complicated and organic derivation that sprawled across over
4772640	4776640	hundreds of years with a couple of hundred years with lots of different kinds of thinkers.
4777200	4781440	And so that's where like my project with regard to thinking about liberalism
4781440	4787360	or post-liberalism if we want or going forward or 21st century liberalism or holistic liberalism
4787360	4792880	which make up words. Let's just throw adjectives. I don't care. My thinking with it is is we have
4792880	4799520	to get down to the essence of what was trying to be achieved, what something made for enormous
4799520	4804480	and I don't mean it in a flippant or glib way genuine progress over the last 300 years.
4804480	4810800	And I know the return dudes with the V can pretend that this progress is all fake and they show the
4810800	4816000	picture of like a wonderful palace and they're like why do we build these ugly buildings now?
4816000	4823200	And it's because we don't have slaves. They've got genuinely like actually valid points about
4823200	4828480	that. There are valid points and there are invalid parts as well. Like I've seen them share the
4828480	4834240	images of like the Tsarist palaces in Russia that literally bankrupted the nation so that the king
4834240	4838320	could have his awesome palace. And there's a reason why we don't do that anymore is because
4838320	4843200	when everybody's actually free to do their own thing, we don't bankrupt nations to build something
4845200	4852480	except for vaccines or something. But the point being is I just think that there's more than one
4852480	4858160	meaning of reason, one of which is mystical, which is that science, it's the epistome and say
4858160	4865520	NTA or the Frenumft and the system, the Wiesenschaft, the Hegel put out. And then there's this thing,
4865520	4870560	this is just like with the progression of science. Newton's over here cooking up calculus,
4870560	4874320	figuring out the Brachastroni problem or whatever it's called, Bracharistochrone,
4874320	4877840	that's what it is. And he's over here solving that problem. He's over here developing
4878400	4882800	differential equations out of his ass, creating physics, you know, mechanics like
4883520	4887520	unbelievable stuff this guy's doing. Meanwhile, he's drinking mercury so he can figure out how to
4887520	4893600	live forever, right? Yeah, like, we got some problems here. 400 years later, we're like, oh,
4893600	4899360	shit, quantum mechanics. And science hasn't even really matured. We have Hegel criticizing Newton
4899360	4905120	over optics. Well, Newton's optics turned out to be right. Hegel's full of shit. Because we have
4905120	4909360	this guy that's over here working in his reason. Oh, okay, how could there be seven colors inside
4909360	4915040	of one color, you know, or whatever he's doing? This is just nonsense. What you have is this
4915600	4921520	maturation process of what we're calling the enlightenment. And I feel like we were to the
4921520	4927200	point where there was where we're really getting to kind of a mature understanding of it. And that's
4927200	4932240	also when the parasite latch onto the side of it. We're the 30s and the 40s, not to hold them up
4932240	4936800	at some special time or whatever. But this is when we really started to like, holy crap,
4936800	4940640	we've got to pull some of the mysticism off of the way we've thought about some of these things.
4941520	4945840	And this is kind of why a lot of people look back at the 50s is like this hyper rational,
4945840	4950640	but in some weird way, really good time is because it's kind of like the peak of the fruit of that
4951360	4956640	turned out to be positive positivist movement, which is its own complicated thing, and went too far.
4957520	4963600	But there's, it's almost like we have to let the idea of reason mature and we have to shed off
4964320	4971120	that Gnostic aspect, which is not reason. It's like the difference between truth and your truth.
4971120	4980000	They have like reason and our reason or science and the science. And it's that where I think the
4980000	4984880	center play goes. So again, it's, I don't, I don't even know that there's a thing called the enlightenment
4984880	4991840	to lay blame upon, but to the degree that it's true, I don't lay blame there. I, we've, we don't
4991840	4998320	know what it looks like when we let it, when we mature it and take this Gnostic aspect and just
4998320	5003760	hammer it out because nobody talks about it. Nobody, nobody, I mean, it's, it's, it's green
5003760	5010560	space completely right now. So the, the problem that I think we might have, and I'm not saying this
5010560	5017840	is definitively, but this has been my impression of it, is that actually it might not be possible to
5017840	5026160	separate the thread of Gnosticism from liberalism. And so if that is the case, we have to question
5026160	5034160	what our commitment to the, to the term liberalism is, because actually I think, and there are,
5035200	5040400	I think I was guilty of this quite some time. I was emotionally attached to the term liberalism,
5040400	5045920	and thinking of myself as a liberal. I had attached a bunch of moral sentiments to this
5045920	5050000	that made me in some way morally good person because I thought that this
5050880	5056080	contains something within it. But I think actually we can detach ourselves from the term
5056800	5062720	and realize that actually this doesn't make us morally invalid. And it also allows us to be more
5062720	5069040	flexible with what we do here, because I agree with you. There are definitely different kinds of
5069040	5073440	reason or intelligence. I agree with you, by the way, on detaching from the term as well.
5073440	5076240	And so this is why I'm happy to use post liberal, because I don't want to,
5077040	5081120	I don't want to abandon liberalism, you know, and I never, I never have wanted to,
5081120	5086960	but it's clear that there is something that's wrong with it. And I think you may have identified
5086960	5093680	accurately in the Gnostic thread, but I think it is so bound up. I don't understand how it could be
5094400	5099200	unpaved. I don't see a way, right? So all I'm thinking is, okay, well, let's,
5100080	5107680	we can bifurcate here and learn from the experience that liberalism has given us
5107680	5112000	and craft something that is free of that Gnostic problem.
5112000	5116000	Right. And so this, for me, is where it's like, I'm trying to, I want to boil down.
5116000	5120000	Imagine it's like literally we're taking liberalism and putting it in a pot and boiling it down.
5120640	5124880	And so all of these kind of false assumptions, we don't have to think so much about these.
5124880	5130400	I mean, we need, we need to address them, but like, what's under them? Why, what's going on?
5130400	5135760	What were these guys after? What were these ideas chasing? And that's again, I just keep
5135760	5141600	coming back to it, is that let's start with a simple fundamental axiom, which I think is the
5141600	5144960	fundamental liberal axiom. We don't have to call it the liberal axiom. The name doesn't matter.
5144960	5148880	I'm not at, actually, by the way, don't have an emotional attachment to be identified as a liberal.
5148880	5153280	I don't like to be identified like as anything. Well, surely it's just James Lindsay.
5153280	5158480	That's right. People are liberal. But no, no, no, no. How mythological of you? You know,
5158480	5164640	James, that's right. The man, the myth, the legend. That's not wrong. Everyone is, you know,
5165600	5170000	but yeah. So the thing is, though, is it's, we're not God and we're not going to be God.
5170720	5176640	And let's start from there. What does it look like if we just accept that no human being gets to have
5176640	5182560	that status or gets to usurp that status and lord it over some other person? In the word Lord
5182560	5187600	is chosen very intentionally in that expression. What does it look like? What does political
5187600	5193040	authority look like? What do we have to do to deal with that? What does, you know, what does
5193040	5198960	kind of social relating look like under this kind of thing? And what you start ending up with is a
5198960	5203040	whole lot of libertarianism and a whole lot of Americanism and a whole lot of stuff that,
5203680	5207440	you know, they stabbed at really well in the Magna Carta. And so, you know,
5207440	5212160	you're kind of along the lines of those projects when you get to that point. And so,
5213360	5218400	it also is a fundamental rejection of the Gnostic project. We're never going to be,
5218400	5227040	it's not even that we're not gods. We will never become gods. We have no claim to make on that
5227040	5231040	level of authority. So then you have questions like, well, how do you decide who gets to be in
5231040	5235920	charge? Whether it's politically, whether it's in terms of a project, whether it's leading a family,
5236640	5243040	well, the answers come down to things like, you know, traditional Moors and which is a question,
5243040	5247680	but ultimately competence and merit. The people who get to lead projects are people who prove that
5247680	5253680	they have the access or the ability to lead a project. As the hard part becomes, how do you
5253680	5258800	determine whether or not they have proven such, credentialism is a problem, nepotism is a problem,
5258800	5263440	people just, you know, going on TV and scamming a bunch of voters and getting elected,
5263440	5267600	even though they're frauds is a problem, people being run, you know, like actresses being run,
5267600	5271040	you know, through deliberate campaigns through things like the Justice Democrats as a problem.
5272320	5278080	You have ways that that system would be gained, but Jordan Peterson hit something extremely
5278080	5283760	important here, that the legitimacy in the hierarchies, if we want legitimate hierarchies,
5283760	5289920	comes from competence, and that that's an ideal in the sense not in like a platonic ideal, but that
5289920	5298400	the higher the level of ordering of a hierarchy, the higher the competence is the fundamental
5298400	5302880	principle ordering that hierarchy, the less corrupt it is. So those are kind of like two
5304320	5309120	antagonistic competence and corruption are like literally two antagonistic concepts.
5309120	5315280	And so by, if we start with the assumption, so again, what does it mean to be liberal absent all
5315280	5319840	of the kind of like John Locke and all Montesquieu and all these guys, what are they right absent
5319840	5323840	all of that baggage? What does it mean? Well, we start with the idea that we're not God, how do
5323840	5328480	we resolve these questions like who gets to be in charge? Well, we have to defer to merit and
5328480	5335040	competence. And what we're what it then becomes is a mechanism that starts to build out legitimacy
5335120	5340480	and hierarchies, which is ultimately, I think what the liberal project is meant to be about.
5340480	5345600	It's a conflict resolution scheme. It's a mechanism by which we can start to
5348400	5354480	hash out legitimacy and hierarchies to the best of our ability. It's never going to be perfect.
5354480	5358960	But the problem is, and this is what I alluded to this earlier, you brought it up earlier. And
5358960	5362800	when you bring up now, you know, that you had an emotional attachment to identifying as a liberal,
5362800	5368960	which God knows we know a lot of people, you know, in our spaces that are that way pathologically.
5372240	5379280	What I see happening in that case is that people are expecting liberalism to do something
5379840	5384240	it's not meant to do. It's not meant to give you a story of your life. It's meant to make it so
5384240	5389680	the state can't give you one for you. It's not meant to give you meaning in your life. It's meant
5389680	5393840	to free you up to pursue meaning where you seek it is not meant to tell you how to operate your
5393840	5399520	relationships. It's meant to allow you to pursue that on your own terms, which is freedom and scary.
5400160	5405680	And not something everybody wants when I've been to China many times. I've talked to Chinese people
5405680	5410720	who obviously live under a tyranny. And some of them are like, please, please, please don't let
5410720	5415360	America fall if it falls the world's done. And others are like, we like to be told what to do.
5415360	5420080	It simplifies things. I haven't ever run into an individual of this kind, but I just read something
5420080	5424320	yesterday talking about one of the impulses underneath communism. Of course, I have it's
5424320	5428320	very famous that it gives you the power to punish your neighbor. But there's a lot of people who
5428320	5433120	actually don't want actually to get the state to punish your neighbor for you. They don't mind
5433120	5437040	being told what to do if it means that their neighbor gets told what to do. And it's not going
5437040	5441760	to, you know, they don't mind it. They like that idea. I talked to a guy, one of the things that
5441760	5446960	radicalized me in like 2012 or 13, I was talking to a grad, a guy I went to grad school with,
5446960	5452560	and he was, we were, you know, it was atheist days, right? Back in the day. And I mean, you were,
5452560	5456560	you were in there, I was in there and the whole thing and there's like all the feminist bullshit
5456560	5460720	that was just out of freaking control. And I was talking to this guy about his frustrating me. And
5460720	5466640	he was like, yeah, but I look forward to our feminist overlords. I'm like, wait, what? And he,
5466640	5471200	I'm like, this is some some beta orbiter stuff. And he's like, I'm like, what? And he's like,
5471200	5475600	yeah, when women are telling men what to do, that's one less thing for me to think about.
5475600	5479680	And it turns out that's exactly the rationale I heard in China. So it's not everybody craves
5479680	5484000	this. It's scary to be free. But if you start believing that liberalism is going to answer
5484000	5487440	questions for you, like what your meaning in life or what it's supposed to be or what your
5487440	5492640	aesthetic experience is supposed to look like, then of course it's going to disappoint you.
5492640	5497280	It's designed literally to make sure authorities can't do that to you.
5498000	5502000	And so at this point, do you mind if I introduce you? So I think this is very interesting because
5502000	5505360	I think it's at this point because Benjamin, I know you've been interested in the concept of
5505360	5511440	tradition for a while and the traditions you've been tradition. Yeah, just the spaces you've
5511440	5517120	been engaging with recently. And I think this is where the concept of tradition actually begins
5517120	5522240	to apply because yes, I agree with everything you just said there, James. But I'm also aware
5522800	5530560	that what you've said is particular to a people, a place, a time, and the result of a continuous
5530560	5537120	and contiguous history. Because like you said, not everyone values that. But the way that was
5537120	5544640	framed was very much rationalistically, right? This was the, as I was saying, ideas are actually
5544640	5551680	a product of a time and place. I don't mean this is a criticism either. It's a very natural for us.
5552320	5559680	post enlightenment people to frame our ideas in exactly that way. And what you've
5560400	5566000	constructed there is a kind of ideological frame that we can pick up and place down.
5567440	5571680	But that's not how I think we should think about it. Because as you referenced,
5573040	5576640	there's a reason that we speak in English, there's a reason that we care about the things that we
5576640	5580480	care about, as the post-moderns would say, we're placing value on the fact that we're even talking
5580480	5585840	about them. And there's a reason that you trace that lineage back to the Magna Carta. Because what
5585840	5593360	we are talking about really are the values of England. And this is something that, of course,
5593360	5598640	why wouldn't America hold the values of England? It was founded by Englishmen. Why wouldn't these
5598640	5603520	continue to be propagated generation after generation? And so now we're not thinking in
5603520	5609280	the abstract realm of ideas, we're thinking in the concrete real world in which we live.
5610000	5616640	And I think that changing the locus of where we begin like that actually allows us to
5617280	5624320	center ourselves in a way that allows us to properly understand the people around us as well.
5625200	5629680	Because what, like I said, I agree with everything you're saying, but I'm also aware that I only
5629680	5634720	agree with that really, because I'm an Englishman. If I was some Iranian imam or something, I'd be
5634720	5639120	like, no, this is preposterous. Why would anyone agree to any of this? God's law is God's law.
5640080	5645840	They would just think you're a kook, a loon. But to me, it seems like second nature. And of
5645840	5649360	course, I agree with all that. Why wouldn't I? Who could think differently? Well, the Chinese
5649360	5658240	person, an Iranian. And so if this is the problem with remaining in the world realm of the abstract,
5658240	5664400	and so if we make it particular and civilizational, it also means that we actually have to draw
5664400	5670960	boundaries, right? It actually means that we have to define where it started and where it stops.
5670960	5677520	And the range that we have within that is where we are. And so now we actually don't need to
5679120	5685280	find ourselves groping in the dark for what hierarchy should look like. You are right. I mean,
5685280	5690400	the hierarchy will be based ultimately on either corruption or competence. That sounds absolutely
5690400	5697760	correct. And they are in contradiction. I agree with that. But also, there's a way of being
5697760	5704080	competently corrupt that I think someone like Vladimir Putin actually deeply embodies. He's
5704080	5710880	obviously a very competent guy, but obviously he's an evil villain. So they aren't mutually exclusive,
5710880	5719280	even though they're in contradiction. But we don't value having a competent villain in charge.
5719840	5726000	We value having someone who might be actually incompetent, but at least they're virtuous in
5726000	5734160	charge. That would be preferable because of our cultural situation. And so once we have this sort
5734160	5741280	of continuum that we can see ourselves within and situated in the human experience in a time,
5741280	5747600	in a place, then I don't know if we can call that liberalism, because as you said, liberalism is
5747600	5754640	this body of ideas. But it is definitely a product of this time and space. If you are to trace the
5754640	5758880	genesis of liberalism, and Stephen Hicks just says, well, it begins in England. And there's a reason
5758880	5763680	for that. Because what, and this is what Michael Oakshaw's perspective was, was just the distillation
5763680	5768560	of the English political tradition. And it is through these political traditions that we could
5768560	5775120	just carry on, as we do, intuitively and instinctively. Because you are right. I mean, like
5775120	5780320	I said, we can rationalize why these things are good. But the rationalization will really be for
5780320	5786400	people like us and those foreigners who agree with us. And so now I've had to make a distinction
5786400	5794560	between these people and those people. And that's more realistic than having the abstract set of
5794560	5799840	ideas. I'm not even sure where I'm going with this point, really. But it feels important to sort of
5800080	5806160	take the ideas out of space, the abstract, the realm of the forms, and put them in the world.
5806160	5810880	This is where they belong. And this is who they belong to. And this is why they belong to these
5810880	5817520	people. And you are right. They came into being for a reason because of royal oppression against
5817520	5822880	the peasantry and against the nobles. The argument was, well, God has mandated this. Well, we'll see.
5822880	5828480	We'll see who's right arm mandates it, who God is really with on that case. And it turns out
5829200	5834880	that it was actually with the people, with the lower orders, and not just with the king. And
5834880	5837840	this had happened a few times, actually. And eventually, the king gets his head cut off
5838400	5844480	until we get to this negotiated settlement, effectively, that becomes the sort of English
5844480	5850560	and then American constitutional system. But that is the product of layers and layers and layers of
5850560	5856800	tradition and experience and personal negotiation between people. And so this is why I return to
5856800	5861440	the kind of mythological view of this thing. It's not just something we can abstract away,
5861440	5865840	and then we can't give liberalism to Afghanistan. And they don't have the institutions,
5865840	5869840	they don't have the traditions, they don't have the thoughts in their head, the instincts
5869840	5874880	to make this thing work. It's just, it's a false oath. It's not their mythology.
5874880	5877200	But so... Just one interjection.
5879040	5883360	When you bring up the mythological and the sentimental, it's not just a negative,
5883360	5889760	it's not just romance, it's not just faith. We can see like Hegel embarked on a project and
5889760	5896160	J.R.R. Tolkien embarked on a project, a massive project that have stood this test of time and
5896160	5902640	influenced huge amounts of genre. But they were both operating probably mythologically,
5902640	5910160	both oriented or dealing with the same kind of imaginal forms. But Hegel abstracted them into
5910160	5915440	ideas. Tolkien put some ideas in there, but nested them in character. So he oriented his
5915440	5921520	imagination differently than Hegel. So the Gnostic tradition, I think, is a type of creativity.
5921520	5931120	It's a type of Western man, a man who is trying to achieve godhood. And that project is incredibly
5931120	5936400	ambitious project and will drive people to do great things. Now those great things might not
5936400	5945760	be good, but those ambitious people, that prompt, become god, will create great things, terrible
5945760	5950720	things too. And that's like the tolerance of sociopaths question. How much do you tolerate
5950720	5956240	sociopaths because they'll create, say, industries by doing horrible things that benefit us all
5956240	5961920	massively even though they do massive evil in the process of doing it? I mean, that's a hard question.
5962480	5969840	But seeing that that type, the Gnostic type, is always like in dialogue, has always been creating
5970560	5977840	artistic works alongside these other types of artistic works, poetry and storytelling that
5979360	5983040	expand the tradition. I just, I think that there's a dialogue there.
5983040	5989360	Artistic is a strong word there for the Gnostics, in my opinion. I don't feel like there's very
5989360	5995680	much art going on there. But I mean, this is a story in Genesis. Genesis chapter three is about
5995680	6003280	this. So this is a human dialogue that's not going away. Definitely not going away. But what I'm
6003280	6009440	worried about with this contingency of culture, I do agree, we're not going to just take liberalism
6009440	6017440	and plop it down in Afghanistan and it's going to take off. It would have to grow there, right?
6017520	6022720	It would have to be that the idea is underneath it, land and people in the right way and they
6022720	6027840	articulate it in their own contingent context, et cetera. And it has to grow and flourish and
6027840	6033440	whatever on its own and kind of grow in and through that context. I don't disagree with that. But I
6033440	6037280	will be as culturally chauvinistic as I have to be about this particular tradition. And I don't
6037280	6042480	think it's just a product of the fact that I happen to live in it and happen to think this way
6042480	6046480	and happen to have been born into a tradition that thinks this way. I look around the world
6047600	6052880	and as Donald Trump rightly pointed out, many whole countries. And I see that there are better
6052880	6058960	and worse answers to these questions of how human beings, which I do not think are, despite our
6058960	6062400	cultural differences, despite our different histories, I do not think that we're functionally
6062400	6069520	that different as organisms as that animal side. If we're going to ground our future political
6069520	6074800	projects in the human, I don't believe in universal man, but I do believe that the
6074800	6084320	boundary of that which is human as a collection is a bounded set. There's a
6085360	6093120	gulf between that set and the set of chimpanzees that is enormous. It's not a small difference.
6094160	6099360	It is a constrained system that defines what it is to be human and the similarities within that
6099360	6105840	does define kind of a imaginary and abstract, yes, universal concept of human. But whatever
6105840	6114320	that boils down to, it seems to me literally not just intuitive or obvious or anything,
6114320	6120320	but just evidentiary over the past 300 years that where these values we can say are these
6120320	6126160	English values or as Stephen Hicks often frames it, the English enlightenment or Scottish
6126160	6131600	enlightenment, even as a Southerner, I'm United States, I'm just kidding, my family is from New York,
6132480	6140640	but mostly actually my family history is partly English and Scottish. It's a little more British
6140640	6147360	highly than that. I've got some German in me too, watch out, the bugs are coming for you. But I've
6147360	6154960	got this whole view that this English enlightenment tapped into fundamentally human values that
6154960	6160400	somehow attached to what Sam Harris kind of comically called human flourishing and moral
6160400	6166240	landscape 15 years ago or whatever. I want to reclaim the term human flourishing. I think
6166240	6172160	that's a perfectly noble goal. Right. But the thing is, I don't think that these ideas are,
6172160	6180480	I don't go as far into the postmodern condition as to accept that this is a totally contingent
6181040	6186880	cultural phenomenon that these ideas worked. These ideas did work because these ideas in
6186880	6194880	this culture because they grew out of this culture. Right. And so there's that aspect of it. But where
6194880	6200800	these ideas have been successfully implemented in other places, they have led to similar levels
6200800	6205760	of flourishing. Like I said, when I go to China, you have people who desire to be ruled. You have
6205760	6209520	those people in America too. I talked to those people. They're all over that. My friend, for
6209520	6215120	example, who had master's degrees coming out of his butthole, but he couldn't get a job and he's
6215840	6219440	wants women to rule over him and whip him or whatever hell he wants. I don't know.
6220240	6225280	Some weird shit. Just a brief interjection. It's not just the export of the ideas,
6225280	6230240	but it's the virtues too. You can't just have liberal ideas without some sort of Christian virtue.
6230880	6235040	Well, I don't know that it has to necessarily be, I mean, I'm not going to say it has to be
6235280	6240080	humility, patience. Every time that you guys bring up a virtue, it's a Christian virtue.
6240080	6243040	Every single virtue that you guys give up is canonized.
6243680	6247840	I would also go further and say that this isn't contingent either. I'd say that Christianity
6247840	6253760	codified those virtues extraordinarily well in a cohesive system that's extremely pro-social.
6253760	6258160	But these, I think, again, Aristotle wasn't a Christian. These are human virtues.
6258720	6261440	No, but the Christians were very influenced by Aristotle.
6261520	6265360	Well, of course they were. They took that from him. He didn't take that from them.
6266000	6270160	So just as a quick interjection, because I find this fascinating because I wonder
6270160	6274400	if this isn't the cultural difference between me as an Englishman and you as Americans, right?
6274400	6282080	Because, no, no, I'm serious about this because Americans do have a habit of seeing themselves
6282080	6286720	as universal men because America is, of course, the most successful project of liberalism.
6286800	6292880	And it's done phenomenally well because historically, it was very rooted in the English
6292880	6297040	tradition of liberalism, which is, as Oakshott put it, just the distillation of English political
6297040	6302000	practice into theory. But of course, if you've got a bunch of people who have been born and raised
6302000	6306160	as Englishmen and then calling themselves Americans but still having the common law,
6306160	6312400	still having these values of accountability and justice and political decentralization,
6312400	6317200	all of the traditional values of England just replicated on the American continent,
6318080	6322640	then it makes sense that that would work because, of course, to the people, and this goes down to
6322640	6328400	the way the language is constructed, the kind of institutions we have, the family values that we
6328400	6334240	share and that you're raised with, these things are radically different in Britain than they are
6334240	6339680	literally just a hundred miles away in France. France has a totally different set of social
6339760	6345040	values to the English. And it's actually remarkable. And the Germans have a totally,
6345040	6348960	totally different set of intellectual values to the English. And then that's not even talking
6348960	6352640	about what the Italians, the Spanish and the Greeks are like. And so it's actually kind of
6352640	6355840	crazy that I had a conversation with a Greek friend of mine the other day. And I was like,
6355840	6361840	mate, if your cousin drove to your house and he was in a stolen car and you recognized the car
6361840	6367280	and someone when he worked makes cars, would you tell the police and say, no, that's crazy,
6367280	6371200	right? You would tell the police, right? I would tell the police, you have to tell the police.
6371200	6375840	But that's because we have literally got radically different social values. He would see that as a
6375840	6382000	form of betraying his cousin. I would see that as a form of betraying the rule of law entirely
6382000	6388000	in this country, right? I would know you, you, you have committed a crime, you have not been
6388000	6392400	virtuous, you have not done the right thing. And I would be doing the right thing by contacting
6392400	6396640	the police and it would be right that you be punished for your theft. That's a very much
6396640	6400720	an English set of values. That's not something that they value in Greece, right? Probably not
6400720	6405840	in America, I don't know, right? That's not, no, like, bro, you should probably go give that back.
6405840	6410160	Like you'd have a conversation with your cousin, but you sure as hell wouldn't go around your
6410160	6415440	cousin out. Well, if he was intransigent about it, you know, maybe, I think you probably should.
6415680	6426160	But the, the, the point is though, the American perspective has always homogenized Europe.
6426160	6428400	Although it's because of the nation of immigrants.
6429120	6432240	No, no, it's not just that. I think it's the remoteness from Europe as well.
6432240	6432640	That helps.
6433440	6435440	And, and the, it's like our best thing.
6436160	6440560	Well, when you're a lot closer, you start to gain a better understanding of actually
6440560	6448160	how particular and parochial our value system is. I mean, for example, the English have never,
6448160	6453840	as a culture, have never been particularly haunted by the ghost of Faust, right? Whereas the Germans,
6453840	6458480	and he's been mentioning many Germans in this, they're deeply riddled by it. They, they, they
6458480	6461600	don't know what to do about this concept. But there's never been a problem with the English,
6461600	6466640	because the English actually have always been quite humble in this idea that actually, of course,
6466720	6470400	God's there. And of course, we're not gods. Of course, you just look at what's in front of your
6470400	6475600	face and you do the best you can with what you have. Because the English, I spoke to a German
6475600	6479760	professor a while ago, he was like, well, you're, you're intellectually lazy. And it's like,
6479760	6484160	yeah, that's, that's true. That is actually quite true. We're not stupid. We're just intellectually
6484160	6488880	lazy. The Germans are not intellectually lazy, though. And this is one of the problems with
6488880	6494160	Kant. Like if you look at what Kant is trying to do, he's essentially trying to formulate
6494160	6501200	a technique for looking into the mind of God and say, right, what is a categorical moral imperative?
6501200	6506320	Only God can set a categorical moral imperative. That's nonsense. No one, no human being could
6506320	6509760	possibly do that. But of course, it didn't come out of the mind of an Englishman. It came out of
6509760	6515600	the mind of a German. And I wonder if this Faustian spirit is the Gnostic element that is running
6515600	6524000	through this. And so when we see this, this exchange of our souls in exchange for unlimited
6524000	6529680	wisdom and power, well, this is essentially what the transgender movement is asking for.
6529680	6534720	Yes, yes, yes. Like we want to be able to do it. And so you can see the Faustian German spirit
6534720	6539760	being embodied in this movement, but it's very alien to the English perspective. And of course,
6539760	6544720	America being an English country means that it is, I think the parasite that you were trying to
6544720	6549440	describe earlier that you, you know, you were saying that this is, and so, but when you put it in
6549440	6556400	this perspective, you can actually name where it's come from. You can name the people, you can name,
6556400	6561200	it's not just an abstract thing. But then it means that you have to kind of police your own
6561200	6566240	boundaries, right? You have to actually, we should do things in the English way because this is what
6566240	6571040	we feel is right. This is our prejudice. Or you can, you can do a little empirical if you look
6571040	6575680	at how these different cultures, let's say France, Germany and Britain, how they scaled
6575680	6581200	when they were exported to other places or when America was started. Like what, which traditions
6581200	6587040	from Europe stabilized at scale and the English stabilized at scale and maybe the Catholic,
6587040	6592960	hold on, but... But this thing, which traditions from Europe? There is no Europe, really. That's
6592960	6600480	the thing that like half of, well, more than half of the Americas is Spanish or Portuguese.
6600960	6605200	And that is utterly alien. You know, that's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. So something
6605200	6610640	in the Spanish tradition scaled and was able to stable, I mean, more or less, they have a lot of
6610640	6616880	problems with Communism, stuff like that. Tyranny. But... Tyranny scaled. And something was unique
6616880	6622400	about the way that the English tradition scaled and was, you know, it's in Australia, it's in
6622400	6628880	Canada, it's here, right? So maybe Germany can't scale, but it can scale within the English,
6628880	6633040	right? Maybe, right? Do you see what I'm saying? Like the body politic?
6633040	6636480	The Germans should be in charge of kitchens. They shouldn't be in charge of countries,
6636480	6639760	because German food is wonderful and German governance is diabolical.
6641280	6645680	The other way around, of course, applies to England, right? English kitchens are terrible,
6645680	6650240	but again, English governance is wonderful. And this is what we're trying to achieve with
6650240	6654720	Magna Carta, with the American Constitution, with liberalism in and of itself as a project.
6655120	6659200	But this means we have to be able to identify what is not
6659840	6664560	what we're looking for. And actually, you know, now I've been able to bifurcate these things,
6664560	6668640	say, right, okay, you are right. It's not just the Enlightenment as one giant thing.
6668640	6671440	There are lots of different places where Enlightenment's were going on. And, you know,
6671440	6675760	cross-pollination of ideas comes back and forward. And we are suffering from one of these
6675760	6677360	cross-pollinations at the moment.
6677360	6680720	Right. French and German cross-pollinating into English and Scottish.
6680720	6681520	Absolutely.
6682080	6683760	And this is David Stocking's point.
6683760	6687680	Correct. And this is against Stephen Hicks, where he's talking about Germans and bad Germans,
6687680	6691520	and more bad Germans, is like the title of one of his chapters. If you haven't read into the
6691520	6696160	Swabian pietist movement, which was a southern German mysticism movement, that it's like,
6697200	6700320	within the broad conception of Europe, it's like the longest
6701600	6706800	holdout in mysticism as the modern era kind of persisted. And this is,
6706800	6710800	Hegel was trained at one of their seminaries. He was trained in the so-called Lutheran.
6710800	6715200	Yeah. So the Swabia, you know, the southern portion there of Germany,
6715760	6723280	Swabia held out with some occult magic for a very long time, well into the 19th century,
6723280	6728160	well into the 19th century. And that's where a lot of these bad Germans and more bad Germans
6728160	6733760	happened to come from. But the influence there of mysticism was much more profound than you had
6733760	6738880	in England. That's probably why this spirit of Faust, and of course, Géritha was one of the
6738880	6744720	characters who was swept up in all of this. Just a quick thing there. England, in this sort of
6744720	6749200	time period, suffering dramatically from Puritanism. Yes, burning the witches.
6749200	6755840	Opposite problem. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah. And so what you actually, if you haven't looked
6755840	6759520	into the Swabian pietist thing. No, I'm going to put it in the brows of it.
6759520	6765600	A lot of these so-called Germans and bad Germans, you want to look up a character by the name of
6765680	6772480	Friedrich Oettinger. I can't ever say his name. It's O-E-T-I-N-G-E-R, right? Oettinger,
6772480	6776560	or it's O with a frickin' umlaut, which nobody can pronounce except Germans.
6777120	6781760	Yeah. And so this guy is one of, he's a teacher of Hegel. This is a very important character
6781760	6787600	and understanding. Also, another kind of German mystic much earlier is Jacob Boma,
6787600	6794320	which is B-O with an umlaut, H-M-E. These characters are extremely influential in the
6794320	6799360	progress of this broad German enlightenment, which is where you're getting this kind of
6799360	6804240	Kantian thought, you're getting this kind of Hegelian and Marxist thought. A difference with
6804240	6809280	American culture to British culture, besides the fact of this Greek cousin loyalty thing, which
6809280	6813680	we have a surprising streak of, kind of the fundamental American value if I had to kind of
6813680	6817920	boil it all down. Just a quick thing there. I mean, we probably do here, but I think that
6817920	6822560	if you approached it as a philosophical conundrum, almost every English person would say,
6822560	6826320	well, of course you should tell the police. When I listen to your accent, I hear you say that,
6826320	6830640	but if you were speaking cockney, I don't think you would. Yeah, well, that's what I'm trying to
6830640	6835200	have at home. I think they would concede that that is the value that they know that they should
6835200	6839120	uphold. Whether they do or not is a totally different question. Obviously, not everyone
6839120	6842880	here is saying or anything. Well, the thing in America, when I said we're a nation of immigrants
6842880	6847680	a moment ago, is the fundamental American value is, oh, you're an American? Great, get a job.
6848240	6852080	Like, which is, I don't give a shit about you, do something productive.
6852080	6855120	And that's kind of what binds us all together. It doesn't matter if you're Muslim,
6855120	6857120	it doesn't matter if you're Buddhist, it doesn't matter if you're white, it doesn't matter if you're
6857120	6862560	black, you're here, you're legal. Great. Shut the hell up and get a job. Like, that's,
6863440	6871040	you know, we, that's deep, isn't it? It is. It enables us. It also enables us, though, to,
6871760	6875760	as I said to somebody the other day, where some intersectional shit was on Twitter and I just
6875840	6882160	replied kind of glibly. And I said, can we just get back to a time when I could like people in
6882160	6888240	particular and dislike people in general? Yeah. Yeah. And I think like, I want to like cool
6888240	6892720	people in particular because I got to know them and I got to hear their ideas. But this is that
6892720	6899920	rampant like, shut up, get a job, do something productive, be somebody. And also you're an
6899920	6903760	individual and that's what I'm going to respect in you is what you've done, not where you came
6903760	6907120	from, not what, not even what your traditions are. Oh yeah, these are your traditions. Cool.
6907120	6910960	Let's have a barbecue and find out about them or whatever. Let's hang out. Do your,
6910960	6914640	do your fest. Let's come. Let's all have like Greek day or whatever. Whatever happens to be,
6914640	6919600	doesn't matter. But it's like, at the end of the day, though, if you're an American, it's like,
6919600	6925360	shut up and get a job. What are you doing? That's our value. Yeah, this is the American tradition.
6925360	6931280	This is, which is why it taps into that idea that there is something that's not
6932240	6940240	the exact idea of the universal man. It's definitely not universal. This is not how
6940240	6945600	Italians think, right? Unless they come to America and they get told to shut up and get a job.
6946560	6954000	No, no, no. They'll do it because they're forced to do it. But that's not the wellspring of their
6954000	6958720	culture. No, I understand. I understand. It is the wellspring of English culture, right? It is.
6958720	6963440	Exactly here. Get a job. Stop being a loafer. Other people, you know, don't rely on them. They
6963440	6966720	should rely on you. You know, you should do your part for the rest of the community rather than
6966720	6973120	have them do their part for you. These are very parochial values. That's the thing.
6973120	6977760	The product and work ethic, yes. Yeah, these are very parochial values. And so this is the,
6977760	6982800	this is the problem, I think, inherent in liberalism is if, because now we're talking
6982800	6986640	about things in a totally different way, right? Instead of constructing an abstract set of
6987360	6991520	ideas that connect together in a certain way and suggesting that this could be universalized.
6991520	6996560	Now we're talking in a particular way and saying, look, we're actually, we exist in relation
6996560	7001920	to other groups of people. Essentially, you're speaking in a more Europeanized way, right?
7001920	7008240	Because I think the American project being a propositional nation actually contains kind of
7008240	7015680	this problem where you guys fall into abstractions. Whereas in Europe, we are not propositional
7015680	7022400	nations. And so we are used to the tradition, the long accumulated acclimate, long
7024560	7030880	accumulator, cultural baggage that we've had with one another, right? I know what a Scott
7030880	7034320	is going to say to me. I know what a Frenchman is going to say to me. I lived in Germany for eight
7034320	7039120	years, right? I know, I know every German thinks before they open their mouth, right? Because
7039120	7044240	they are all the same in many different ways. But they're also all very different to what the
7044240	7048400	average person in England is like, right? And they're all lovely, by the way. I've never met a
7048400	7051920	German I didn't like. But that's because I never put them in charge of the country.
7054400	7061920	And I swear to God, I'll go to my grave believing this. But you realize that these differences
7061920	7069680	are really important and they matter and they are tangible. And what's more is you begin to
7069680	7075200	build a relationship with the differences. And it's probably the same with Americans and Mexicans
7075200	7082080	actually. Because I mean, I personally don't view Mexicans as Americans. The blacks are Americans,
7082080	7086160	the whites are Americans. The Mexicans are not Americans, they're Mexicans. And it's because
7086160	7091840	they come from the inquisitorial legal system. They come from the Mediterranean family system.
7091840	7094560	They come from a different religion. They speak a different language.
7094640	7098960	Oh, by Mexican, you mean the Latinx? No, no, just Mexicans.
7100720	7104480	People from Mexico are not Americans. They are Mexicans, right?
7104480	7108560	You said American in front of Americans who mean the United States and we got confused.
7108560	7111680	You meant Americans like American continents. Okay, we're clarifying.
7111680	7114640	No, no, I mean like people from the United States, right?
7114640	7120800	Mexicans from the United States. No, no. Mexicans have a different legal system.
7120800	7124400	They have a different family structure. They have a different religion and a different language.
7124480	7133680	Correct. In Europe, you would never call that, you know, you like that, you're essentially saying
7133680	7139120	that these are Spanish people, right? Mexicans are Spanish people. You're English people.
7139120	7141200	You're not the same. They're not the same. They're different.
7141200	7142640	Okay, I see what you're saying. Yes.
7142640	7147520	And so it's, so when, you know, when they're like, Oh, Mexican Americans, I know you're just
7147520	7150000	Mexicans who live in America. You're not Mexican Americans.
7150000	7155360	Well, see, you're, we have a completely different way of thinking about America.
7155360	7159360	And we have a problem with the border, you know, but we have so much cultural mixing.
7159360	7164560	We don't think of America as white Anglo-Saxon European. That's just one strain.
7165360	7166400	I'm not, right?
7168080	7173280	It's, it's, see, now you are abstracting into a category already there, right?
7173280	7177120	Because what I'm talking about is America is so abstract. That's the problem with America.
7177200	7180080	We're, we're not as proquel as you guys.
7180080	7184960	No, no, it is. That's exactly the problem. And it's because America is a propositional
7184960	7190160	enlightenment nation that's built on liberal, liberalism itself, liberal philosophy. And so,
7191760	7197440	but there is a thing that other people outside of America recognize as an American,
7197440	7204560	and it doesn't mean white. It means American. And that doesn't mean Mexican, right? Like,
7204560	7207920	I don't know how to describe it. Like, like I said, the blacks are Americans,
7207920	7212320	but also the whites are Americans. And there are, you know, people who are born and raised America
7212320	7217040	in American customs and traditions, who have never been in another country who are not black
7217040	7221760	or white, but are American, right? But people who move to America from another country and like,
7221760	7226160	yeah, I just want to get a job and, you know, work hard and make money. That's not enough to
7226160	7229520	make them. No, no, no, I agree. I agree. I agree. Okay. I know what you're saying now.
7229600	7235120	Yeah. Yes. Yes. That is true. There is a cult. There is a distinct cultural value,
7236240	7240160	cultural suite of values that defines that which is American.
7240720	7246000	But also, it's not just the values. It's about how you are raised. It's about the communities
7246000	7250880	you're raising. No, I hear you. The customs, you know, the character. Yeah, I agree. I agree.
7250880	7254640	The one thing that America has this that Europe doesn't have, and I think it's actually the
7254640	7259920	lack of this is kind of crippling Europe at the moment, is this incorporative ideology
7259920	7266320	that is becoming an American, right? We don't have that. That's exactly what I was wanting to
7266320	7272320	suggest off of that is, yeah, because you can have that character, whether they come from Mexico
7272320	7278800	or they come from China, whether they come from, I guess, your primitive island, and they can become
7278880	7284480	American. They can kind of adopt that suite. They can join the tribe.
7285680	7292000	Well, yes, in a sense, but Benjamin had a wonderful point, though, when we look at how,
7292000	7298720	what happens empirically when these particular sets of values get exported,
7299520	7306160	formerly by empire, but not as much in the literal, not in the literal sense by empire,
7306160	7311120	by anybody but China anymore. But we have these kind of weird economic empires and so on. We
7311120	7316400	thought, allegedly, we thought we could transform China into a kind of more Western liberal nation
7316400	7322240	by exporting business values, which they seem to have judoed on us. Turns out we didn't study our
7322240	7326480	martial arts before we went to the center of martial arts. They acted Chinese about it.
7327200	7333040	A little bit, or yeah, among others. That's not an insult. That's just an observation.
7333520	7345040	I mean, there's more to it than this, but the fact of the matter is that when we export these
7345040	7355200	values, we see improvements. And that doesn't take away from somebody like in America. I don't see
7355200	7360160	anything that takes away from your ability to be German or Mexican or whatever as you become American,
7361120	7369200	which is a very interesting thing. Having known people from all over or from all different
7369200	7377200	backgrounds, who at the, I don't know how many Iraqis, for example, that I've met, who become
7377200	7384640	American, they come, they immigrate, they go through naturalization, they become legal citizens.
7385360	7390560	And so you have these guys, their accent never goes away, their kind of cultural
7390560	7396080	demeanor doesn't change because they were raised in these things. And yet, they're walking down
7396080	7402400	the street literally in a suit made of American flags, like waving an American flag, shouting
7402400	7407600	about the 4th of July, quoting Thomas Jefferson. And there's something about this where they become
7407600	7413680	uniquely Iraqi and American at the same time. And that in corporate development, and I think
7413680	7418160	you're right, it is crippling Europe. And it's, I think, why you guys have fought with each other
7418160	7423360	the way that you have so much. And America, I think, was founded in part, looking over at you
7423360	7429920	guys and being like, not you specifically as in English. No, no, no, you're up broadly with the UK
7429920	7434880	kind of as an appendage of that. I know we don't get too much into whether or not it's European.
7435760	7442000	And saying like, not this way, American man, you know, let's let's try a different path.
7443440	7447200	And that's why I said that, you know, oh, you're here, you're legal, get a job,
7447200	7454240	become such a constitutive thing for what it means to be American. And it's also,
7454240	7460160	it's not with the like the Australian tall poppy, keep your head down, mate, kind of attitude.
7460160	7465200	But there is a certain like, it's, it's much more New York City, shut the fuck up,
7465200	7471920	you know, kind of attitude in America of kind of a humility. Unlike, again, it's in Australia,
7471920	7477520	they cut each other down and nobody's allowed to be cool at all. Yeah, I know you. Yeah, I've been
7477520	7484320	to your island. But we don't, it's about knowing your place, though, right? And this, this is,
7484400	7490240	this is the difference between the rest of the Anglo sphere in America. But the, this
7490240	7495440	Incorporative Ideology is a remarkable technology. But I think it's only possible because America
7495440	7502080	is an explicitly propositional nation. And so what, what, what I'm, what I mean, then, is
7502960	7507040	essentially America has a moral responsibility never to build a McDonald's anywhere other than
7507040	7513840	America, right? Because what you're doing is you're not being sensitive to the fact that
7513840	7520960	actually this is an intrusive cultural institution that begins to subvert and undermine
7520960	7527840	other native cultures that are not based on this kind of customary traditional propositionalism
7528400	7532720	that is not prepared to deal with it either. Because why would you have thought about this
7532720	7538800	in any way, shape or form, right? So it America can't help but undermine the traditions of other
7538800	7543440	countries all over the world. And the only reason I think that plays like China are kind of immune
7543440	7548080	to it is because they're essentially affected by the Germans. They're, they're not into it by the
7548080	7552400	way. Well, yeah, yeah, sure. But like, you should go and you should see why they have any antibodies
7552400	7558000	then is because they are, they're currently occupied by German ideology, you know, and I agree with
7558000	7562640	the German ideology part there. Yeah, it's, it's, but it is, you know, it was invented by a German.
7563600	7568560	And so it's, that's the only reason they can resist it in any way or, or shape it to their
7568560	7574960	own ends. And so, I mean, they covet it and they dress like they covet it and don't know how to
7574960	7581200	covet it correctly. It's not as bad now as it's matured a little. The Nouveau Rich in China,
7581200	7588640	the first times I went, I mean, it was, you know, the most garish, you know, you pick whichever
7588640	7593600	brand Gucci, I don't even know my brands that you're supposed to be all the big ones, right?
7593920	7597920	They're obnoxious symbols, the G's and the D's and the things and the whatever.
7597920	7604720	We're not supposed to mention the Balenciaga one anymore. Every piece of clothing on a person
7604720	7610480	was a different one of them with the brand logo as large as it can possibly be. It's like a guy
7610480	7617760	wearing a jacket that's a giant Ferrari with like Lamborghini pants, like to show off how he's part
7617760	7623760	of all the big expensive brands and like everybody was like that. And it's toned down now. I mean,
7623760	7630080	just the most obnoxious kind of, and it was a phenomenon of being the Nouveau Rich phenomenon
7630080	7636720	and the covetousness of, of the West. And they have this weird, like, exploitative
7637520	7642880	ass, like mentality about it. But at the same time, they also, it's like, if you're a white American
7642880	7646960	in China, they worship you and use you at the same time and hate you at the same time. It's a
7646960	7653280	really weird phenomenon to kind of experience. You're getting major positive and negative racism
7653280	7658800	at the same time against you, for sure. Yeah. My sister worked in South Korea for a while,
7658800	7663200	and she had a friend over there who he had a beard and Koreans would just come up to the
7663200	7667600	street and just touch his face. That's happened to me in China. Yeah. And I was just like,
7667600	7672080	that is horrific. You know, I can't imagine strangers just coming up and touching my face.
7672080	7677360	They'll come up with a cell phone right in your face. Yeah. I mean, all kinds of really strange
7677360	7682960	things. I mean, on the more fun side, like pretty girls will just run up to you and take selfies
7682960	7689680	with you for no reason. Yeah. But this, but this is what I mean when essentially we have to make
7689680	7696800	the Americans understand they are parochial and their view of mankind as universal is tied to the
7696800	7702880	liberalism and it's also damaging other cultures, right? But I don't, I don't, as maybe it's my
7702880	7708480	Americanness, I just don't see a problem. Well, there's the flip side with wellness. No, no, no,
7708480	7714240	that is, of course you don't, because it's what you're used to. It's what you are familiar with.
7714240	7720640	It's what you expect, right? But I'm, I've, this, this is what the return guys are talking about,
7721200	7727280	but not articulating it well enough. It's, it's this kind of cultural imperialism that
7728400	7733360	seems justified when you say, well, we have a better culture, but you've got to remember that
7733360	7737360	everyone thinks they have a better culture. And what you really have is just more power,
7737360	7741520	right? Because if it was the other way, there'd be like, well, my Latvian culture is just better
7741520	7745120	than your American culture. That's why I get to impose on you. And so it's actually not
7745120	7752080	sentimental in any way. It's actually now rationalistic. And actually, the way that the,
7752080	7759440	the European powers have been have forced us into sentimental relationships with one another,
7759440	7764640	because of the lack of over single power domination of the continent. Actually, if you look at the
7764640	7768800	European nations, they're all roughly the same size, you know, they're at least all comparable.
7769600	7776400	And so it's kind of forced us to have some form of respect for that other culture that we don't,
7776400	7781360	and so we, we've got a saying in, in England is when in Rome, you do as the Romans do,
7781360	7788880	but that's not something Americans believe. And it's destroying civilizations. And so it's this,
7788880	7793840	but I genuinely think it's tied to the, the American liberal experience of the world,
7793840	7797520	thinking of themselves as universal men and anyone can come and be an American,
7797520	7802320	actually, no, I don't really think that's true. And also, I think that that concept is being
7802320	7808160	exported in a damaging way to other people. And so I think that I think a lot of it is why
7808160	7813920	there's a fundamental resentment against America, because I like, I like loads of Americans,
7813920	7820320	I like loads of Americans. But also, I can see why a lot of people don't like Americans, you know,
7820320	7824480	and so, I mean, it's probably because I'm English, and therefore we've got very, very,
7825280	7830160	almost harmonious values and sense of humor, and I'm used to American culture. And so,
7830160	7834880	yeah, I get along really great with Americans. But I do understand the complaints against America.
7834880	7839760	I think that those vaguely sympathetic. Those complaints are actually working themselves
7839760	7846560	out within America. When we have the democratic establishment, the deep state, whatever it is,
7846560	7852160	they think that they're superior, that their values are universal, and they despise the parochial
7852160	7858800	Americans. And they're worlds apart. And so one of the tensions between the
7858800	7863840	left and the right in our country, which we project out of the world, is that universalizing
7863840	7869040	all-consuming bureaucratic mindset, and then this like localized red state-ish,
7869760	7878400	more rural uniqueness that you are explaining as America at large is doing the rest of the world.
7879200	7884640	No, and this is why I'm so totally in support of like the MAGA movement, you know, not so much
7884640	7891120	Trump himself, but the people that he is representing. These are the sort of people that
7891120	7895680	in Europe, I would recognize as just my countrymen, you know, they're just my fellow Englishmen.
7897120	7902800	And these are the people that I don't want to see the left destroy. You know, the left will
7902800	7906960	destroy this unique traditional culture, and that's what it is. And that's what we have in
7906960	7913280	Europe. And so we have to get out of the mindset of rationalistic universalism to be able to appreciate
7913280	7917600	that that's there. Now, that's not to undo any of what we were talking about at the beginning of
7917600	7921360	this conversation, because honestly, I agreed with almost all of it. I think you'll agree with
7921360	7928240	the next thing I'll say, but carry on. Okay. We need to be able to have a rational perspective
7928240	7932800	on the world, obviously. But I think that should include the appreciation for the
7932800	7937120	native traditional cultures that we have. See, so I don't think that the left has a
7937120	7942000	rational universalist perspective whatsoever. I think they have a Gnostic universalist perspective,
7942000	7946160	which is they know better and everybody has to be that. And I don't feel like that's actually
7946160	7951760	fundamentally American at all. I don't think Americans, no, it's not at all think. Yeah,
7951760	7956320	it is German. That's right. They have a systematic philosophy. That's why they
7956320	7961120	shouldn't be heads of states ever. You can go to your grave. I'll go with you, maybe not to your
7961200	7965840	grave, but in agreement, it'll be a group grave, I'm sure. We can, we can, we're all gonna die on
7965840	7969360	some hill, some time. We can, yeah, we can tell them on Louise right off the side of that one
7969360	7976000	together, holding hands, the whole thing. But it is, but that's, and again, this is that Swabian
7976000	7981120	pietist thing, because it so informs what we see as German philosophy, because the German systematic
7981120	7988000	philosophies grew largely out of that, which was a Gnostic kind of attempt to fuse Gnosticism and
7988000	7991920	the kind of emerging enlightenment science and the emerging enlightenment philosophy
7991920	7999120	in the German context. So I hear what you're saying. I think that these things should be
7999120	8009120	allowed to play out organically. If that, I don't think that destroys, it does damage or transform
8009120	8014640	or change traditional cultures, but I don't think it destroys societies or even cultures. I think
8014720	8020000	it allows them to change with time and if you want to be contingent about it with the
8020000	8024560	contingent circumstances of that they find themselves in the times and places and communication
8024560	8029040	modes that they have. That's not a problem, but it's when you have this imperialistic
8030320	8032800	that I have a problem with. So let me stop you there because
8035280	8042000	this again, feels like an opinion that is centered in the sort of rational liberal perspective.
8042960	8045360	I'm not trying to just constantly pull you up on it, but
8047200	8052240	traditional cultures do change over time. The great example of that was Queen Elizabeth's funeral,
8052240	8058880	where you could see traditional uniforms and costumes from each era of Britain's history
8060640	8066320	marching in procession. It's kind of preposterous in a way, but it's also a testament to what we
8066400	8072000	have been through as a country. It's not that traditional cultures don't change.
8072000	8077200	The problem is that the American rationalism that I agree is infected with German Gnosticism,
8077200	8082080	I totally agree, but this is being exported around the world and it's kind of liquefying
8082080	8088640	these cultures. So it becomes impossible to have a true and sincere commitment to
8089520	8095440	the traditional way of life in that place. I think actually it is a problem and it is
8096160	8100400	kind of anti-human because at least one thing we can say about the traditional cultures is
8100400	8105440	they're authentically human. They're just that kind of human. There are lots of kinds of human,
8105440	8110240	but it's authentically a human experience. This is where I don't go with you.
8113200	8118400	Which is fine. We don't have to agree obviously, but this is where I don't go with you.
8118720	8126080	I just impressed that again, we can call it the English side and the German side or whatever
8126080	8136560	we want to call it, but the Gnostic aspect is not necessarily woven thoroughly through what it means
8136560	8145280	to be American or liberal. It is a thing that has grown up with it and is parasitic upon it.
8145280	8152560	And I think that our values of universalism as we were talking about earlier created an opening
8152560	8159120	by which say through critical race theory and the literally Marxist perversions of civil rights
8160560	8166400	that have created this kind of monstrosity. I think that we can make it very evident that this
8166400	8171760	German idealism or this Gnosticism by asking where does it propagate? Where does it scale?
8171760	8177440	It scales within bureaucracies specifically, which means corporations, which means
8178560	8183680	nominally efficient systems and it propagates in media, it propagates in colleges too.
8184240	8190080	And if we see that wherever these ideas are transmitted, they're probably transmitted through
8190720	8195440	business, through forms of business, through forms of interaction and a culture. And what they blend,
8195440	8204400	it is a type of person. The cubicle man is a type of person. It's not a type of person,
8204400	8209520	but he's thinking in a universalized form. He's thinking in terms of bureaucracies,
8209520	8212320	thinking in terms of what did you say? Abstractions.
8212320	8218800	Abstractions by just chopping people down into a little functionary but fungible. He just thinks
8218800	8224480	in that way. And that way of thinking is, again, it's very good at doing certain things.
8225200	8232880	But it also propagates, I think Carl's critique is that it puts every individual
8232880	8239760	into a blender and it erodes societies. But when we go back to the question that you posed at
8239760	8244400	the beginning, James, about there's this beast that we have to defeat, if you do want to tie it
8244400	8249440	to Gnosticism and then see where Gnosticism propagates through the systems or the cultures,
8250720	8257360	then we can see how to create cultures or systems, corporations, and states that are immune to it
8257360	8263040	that still have the same kind of functionality, that still train people, that still inform people,
8263040	8268000	and that still rule people, but are still immune to that whatever this mind virus is.
8268960	8274000	I mean, it attaches to centralization of power and monopoly is what it attaches to
8274000	8280320	extraordinarily efficiently. And so whatever you're looking forward to, and I actually think that one
8280320	8287200	of the reasons besides this kind of civil right parasitism that we cannot ignore, it cannibalized
8287200	8291920	civil rights movements from within, became very strong and emerged as kind of a destructive
8291920	8296800	dragon that's burning down societies. The woke problem, I mean specifically with the identity
8296800	8306400	politics, what I've referred to as identity Marxism more specifically, it cannibalizes or it attaches
8306400	8312080	to, I should say, to centralized power and monopoly. So we have to be thinking in terms of, I think
8312080	8317360	that other than just that, that's where I was going with it, sorry, I think that one of the main
8317360	8325120	things that has happened is that because of the rapid changes that came, structurally speaking,
8325120	8331680	in every culture, this is not even a cultural argument, due to the rapid transformation of
8331680	8338800	technological communications technology in particular, but also, so that's big tech,
8338800	8344400	basically, but also financial technology, these two sectors of the economy rapidly changed,
8345120	8352640	rapidly gained the kind of monopolistic power, because they were ahead of whether it's legislation,
8352640	8357200	whether it's out of culture, they were ahead in their developments of everything else.
8357840	8362960	They gained this kind of power, I was thinking about this yesterday, that it's the kind of power
8362960	8369280	that corrupt or evil governments covet, or maybe we should just be more realistic and say that all
8369280	8374640	governments covet. They covet the kind of power that the tech industry and the financial industry
8374640	8380080	were able to accrue over the past 20 years due to technological transformation that we haven't
8380080	8386480	been able to answer yet. What does it look like going forward? I think that the liberal project
8386480	8390560	of decentralization of power that nobody deserves political authority, so we're going to
8390560	8394480	decentralize that. Nobody gets to answer questions, does the final say, well, this is just how we do
8394480	8398160	shit around here. Nope, we're going to ask the question. I think that while that does have a
8398160	8409360	corrosive or a subversive or a acidic dissolving kind of effect, or can, it also prevents the
8409360	8413280	ability for this thing to take over, but the reason that it was able to take over was because
8413280	8418560	new technologies emerged. I think I've hit it. I think I've hit it. You are right. There is a
8418560	8426160	parasite. You are absolutely right, because the distinction, I think, should be made between
8426160	8430960	English and French liberalism, because English liberalism is built on negative rights, of course.
8432000	8437600	What the king can't do to you, and this, of course, comes from the medieval tradition of
8437680	8445760	essentially the Anglo-Saxons fighting against the Norman occupiers. That manifests explicitly
8445760	8454000	in negative rights. However, the French view of liberalism, as we know as Rousseau, manifests in
8454000	8458560	a series of positive rights. In fact, it's almost an entirely positivistic doctrine when you get down
8458560	8463760	to the base of it. You can literally see this in the formulation between Locke and Rousseau,
8463760	8468320	whereas Locke thought we sacrificed a portion of our natural rights to protect the rest
8468320	8472480	through the creation of a government, which, of course, then is subject to negative
8473120	8480000	behaviors, negative restraints. Rousseau believed we exchanged our natural rights for civil rights,
8480640	8486160	and that's a positive perspective on rights rather than a negative one. That strikes me as the
8486240	8496800	parasite itself. The problem, though, is that that really inflames 20th-century civil rights
8496800	8502640	doctrines, because essentially the Civil Rights Act would have to be one of those key points where
8502640	8513040	you point to and say, look, that's the parasite. It has to be grounded back in the very English
8513040	8517760	declaration that Thomas Jefferson wrote down and following Locke, of course, and then tried to live
8517760	8523280	up to and fail that they exploit. It has to be grounded correctly. I think this is where, not
8523280	8527440	that I'm a huge fan of Caldwell's book, The Age of Entitlement. I do like it. I think it's an
8527440	8531760	important book, but where you actually see with the Civil Rights Movement that there was this
8531760	8535600	split. And in fact, the problem in the United States is we have two constitutional orders right
8535600	8541680	now, two fundamentally different, irreconcilable constitutional orders. One of them is, in fact,
8541680	8548080	an entitlement state that is this French Enlightenment or French liberal positivistic
8548080	8554560	state. I don't think that, I don't know about the Civil Rights Act themselves, but the judicial
8554560	8558480	interpretation of those that followed very rapidly, the enactment of the Great Society
8558480	8564160	with Johnson and going forward, these things explicitly took the path that he's outlining
8564160	8568240	as the Asian entitlement. And these things explicitly became the pathway by which the
8568560	8572800	virus was able to start to cannibalize the liberal tradition. And I think that this is
8572800	8578560	absolutely crucial for us to understand, to start unwinding, because now when we understand it this
8578560	8584480	way, we have one massive advantage. Not only do we get conceptual clarity, we can start to identify
8584480	8590400	unique judicial decisions that took us down the wrong road, which means that those judicial
8590400	8596320	decisions can be brought to review. We just had the huge thing with Roe v. Wade, but you start
8596320	8602080	looking at things like in universities, Bakke versus, what was it? Is it the Regents of the
8602080	8606160	University of California? You start looking at that, you start looking at employment like Duke
8606160	8610880	versus Griggs Power. I think that's what that's called. You start looking at those,
8612320	8617600	there's a handful of these cases, like kind of landmark cases. You can figure out which ones
8617600	8622480	they are, because the critical racers point to them obsessively. And you can figure out which
8622560	8627040	ones they were that took us down this path. And then those going under judicial review can actually
8627040	8632560	take, not the Civil Rights Act necessarily themselves, which could be rooted in our 14th
8632560	8636880	amendment, which can be rooted back to the Declaration of Independence. But all of the judicial
8636880	8642080	interpretation that came after those that created this second constitutional order that were,
8642080	8648400	this parasitic, pseudo constitutional order that we go under, where we are now reinterpreting what
8648400	8654000	the Constitution was intended to mean, or what law is intended to, what the civil rights laws are
8654000	8660720	intended to say. In particular, here's one of the little manipulations, protected class. So
8660720	8665840	civil rights law says that race, for example, is a protected class. That's not the same thing as
8665840	8670800	saying certain races are protected classes of individuals, right? That's a completely different
8670800	8678080	conception of what a protected class means. And when we disentangle these, we actually
8678080	8685440	can find a path out of this through means, while post liberal cultural renewal may be
8686240	8691600	a valuable project. We can find ways that are strictly within the liberal legal tradition
8691600	8696880	to unwind this mess. Where again, like we said earlier, nobody has to become a revolutionary
8696880	8704480	to get out of this. So this I think is best exemplified in the bake the cake controversy,
8704480	8711200	right? Because this seems to me to be the perfect example that the state is going to force someone
8711200	8715440	to bake a cake against their will, because it would be discriminatory for them not to.
8716640	8723840	That's the, it's such a perfect exemplification of positive rights in action. I get to force you
8723840	8732160	to do something or else, right? That's the total inversion of the English liberal tradition,
8732400	8735680	what I consider to be the proper liberal tradition, like we were trying to think of.
8735680	8739840	You see that in the conversion therapy bills too, where they took the concept of forcing somebody
8739840	8744560	to change their sexuality, being wrong to questioning somebody's gender identity to be
8744560	8751520	wrong, right? Yes. But the thing is this, what this means is that you will be opening up a space
8751520	8757440	where it will be allowable for people to be bigoted, right? Because it will be that right. You
8757440	8765200	can't tell not to be. But of course, it will also mean that you don't have the parasite saying,
8765200	8770560	right, now I've been given a license to force you to do these things. Why can't I just use
8770560	8776320	this license to force you to do a whole bunch of other things as well, right? You know, and the,
8776320	8783840	the, this is when we become the government's job to rid the world of bigotry, like, well, that's
8784720	8790960	approximately 1968. Thank you for asking. Yes, that's exactly. That's the positive
8790960	8794880	right. That's, and that is the parasite that gives itself totalitarian license over society.
8794880	8799840	Actually, I'm, I'm glad we've, we've hammered on this actually. But I mean, it does mean you will
8799840	8807600	find, you know, a shop with a Nazi side. But who cares? Well, I don't care. I'm totally liberal
8807600	8812640	about that. You know, it's like, I know I'm not going to shop there, you know, and like, I actually
8812720	8817280	am persuaded by the capitalist arguments on that. It's like, no one's going to shop there. And,
8817280	8824080	but this, and this in fact ties nicely into my theory of social moral sentiments, which is
8825200	8829360	people in the community will exert their own kind of moral pressure on that person.
8829360	8833760	They're like, oh, you're the guy with the Nazi sign. I'm not going to shop. What piece of
8833760	8838560	shit you are, you know, piss off. I'm going in just any other shop that doesn't say no blacks
8838560	8843600	or no Irish, you know, on it. And so I do think you will get this kind of moral corrective measure.
8843600	8847120	No Irish. Is that a thing where, where you're from? Do you, do you guys have that?
8847120	8848960	It was the thing where you came from. That was the thing where we are.
8848960	8853200	Okay. You guys don't have like pro Irish legislation in the 60s coming down where
8853200	8858640	you guys are forced to adore them. Okay. No, that was, you can start potatoes planning.
8858640	8863440	No, no Irish was assigned. That was an American. That was totally American.
8863440	8866160	Maybe we should have stuck with the no German. I don't know. I'm just kidding.
8866160	8870080	Yeah. But the point is you just put that on the Capitol and left it there.
8870080	8875360	But, but did it have to be legislated that the no Irish signs were taken down or did they just fall
8875360	8880720	out of favor? That, you know, that's, that's the perennial question. I mean, that literally is
8880720	8883760	the question at the heart of what was going on with the civil war. So I don't know that we're
8883760	8890640	about to answer that one. I just don't know. Well, it takes a certain amount of humility to,
8891520	8895680	well, I guess it takes a certain amount of hubris to try to shape culture to say we,
8895680	8900240	our culture are, we are no longer going to behave in this manner. And maybe sometimes
8900240	8904640	that's a good thing where you force people to behave differently. Maybe there are good uses
8904640	8909280	to put that. But once you give that power, this is the old kind of tired, or once you give that
8909280	8914480	power to the government, then they can do that. And they actually have to do that indefinitely
8914480	8918720	to maintain their cutting edge power. And that's why you have the civil rights going all the way
8918720	8924160	down into for some reason, children being exposed to grown men and women face, right?
8925120	8925600	Yes.
8925600	8927280	It's progressive in that direction.
8927280	8932400	But this, this is, this is the point though, like, I agree that it would be
8933040	8937440	far better to have a system purely of negative rights. And that would be not only sustainable.
8937440	8942880	I don't think that would actually have an acidic effect either, because it would be tolerant of
8943600	8947680	things that you didn't like. You know, you, you would have to be like, well, look,
8947680	8951120	that's just the way they do things. You'd effectively arrive at the when in Rome,
8951120	8955840	do as the Romans do perspective, you know, you let them do what their thing. And, you know,
8955840	8959600	you might not agree. But then it's, then it's a social issue. So then it's for all of us to
8959600	8963200	have a conversation about, say, well, look, actually, why are you saying that black people
8963200	8967840	can't come to your shop? That's awful. You know, how, you know, what an awfully stigmatizing thing
8967840	8971280	to do that would be, you know, and so we can agree that that would be a terrible thing to do
8971280	8977600	without having the state, essentially, and the Ben Shapiro at gunpoint. I mean, technically,
8977600	8982720	yes, you know, it's a bit hyperbolic, but yes, technically, you got to go through a lot of dorks
8982720	8987760	to get to the gun. Yeah, I know, I know, you really are more acceptable. I get some more
8987760	8992400	functionaries than dorks, but I just hate it when he compresses down everything into right now,
8992400	8998720	it's a gun. So come on, Ben, you know, come on, you know, it's an extreme way of framing it. But
8999680	9003920	but then, but then we're into the realm of being human, right? Then we're into the realm of consideration
9003920	9008880	and empathy and dealing with each other like human beings rather than having a bureaucrat
9009600	9016160	telling you what you have to do. So, you know, that's that's my view, I suppose. I don't think
9016160	9024400	I disagree with that at all. That was an amazing conversation. I have to get off to work. That's
9024400	9028640	why I'm wrapping it up. And I'm sure that you guys need to do other things, but thank you both
9028640	9034800	for blowing my mind and stretching my bladder. That was fascinating. Yeah, mine too. So I'll
9034800	9040560	link links to your work in the description, but James got new discourses and Sargon runs
9040560	9045440	Lotus Eaters. You also have YouTube, both have YouTube channels, which are fascinating work.
9045440	9049600	So yeah, they're good ones. No, they're great. If we do say so ourselves.
