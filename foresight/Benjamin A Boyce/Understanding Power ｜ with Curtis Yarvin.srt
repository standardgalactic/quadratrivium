1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,640
One thing that you said during one I can't remember which one you said that you would you should write a science fiction novel

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,920
But you you don't want to write fiction. You don't think that you're good. I'm not I'm not I'm not a good fiction writer

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,920
Yeah, but I was thinking and

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:23,160
Like in the style of fadress or a meal or like some sort of dialogue where you're talking to you're talking to the student

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,160
You know cuz I yeah

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,280
There's I mean

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,080
Sure go on go on well you talk about like one of your big ideas is this this monarch

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:39,600
But I don't I don't get a sense of who that monarch would be like what it would his character be like you talk about the system

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,080
But I wonder like if you get a bad guy in the system. How do you know like from your perspective like what virtues?

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,080
this this yeah, I mean I think I think people try to sort of

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,760
There's a lot of

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,000
Fear there and people try to sort of overplay

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,000
People sort of overplay the problem which is like somewhat

14
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,560
banal in my view

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,040
I mean, you know one way to think about it is

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,040
If you look at the fortune 500 companies, right? There's 500 of them because that's why it's the fortune 500

17
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,040
and

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,840
You know the smallest of them has certainly thousands of employees

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,760
And so you've got

20
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,280
Sort of 500 men and women

21
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,720
From that world who are experienced in holding that kind of

22
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,200
Responsibility and if you look at their sets of like virtues and vices

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,640
they're probably mostly pretty similar and

24
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,600
You know

25
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,760
Some of the ways I sort of regard people's kind of fear of monarchy is

26
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,640
They sort of

27
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,960
Imagine you're picking the CEO of Chipotle, right? And you're like first great priority is he's not gonna run

28
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,400
Come up and with an evil scheme to like poison the burritos

29
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:15,360
Because clearly he's the CEO so he could order poison put in the burritos could be a slow acting poison

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,960
something right and and it's like the the

31
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
executive search team when

32
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,000
They pick the Chipotle CEO

33
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,960
Does not really worry about we got to find someone who's not gonna poison the burritos and

34
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,920
So like, you know, your bar is just a good bit higher than that

35
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:46,320
And so, you know, I don't know who the CEO Chipotle is. He's probably fine. He's probably I mean, I guess, you know, the thing is that

36
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
There are

37
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,680
One of the ways people talk about the job in Silicon Valley is to describe the two kinds of CEOs

38
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,360
Sort of people will say wartime CEOs and peacetime CEOs. That doesn't mean these companies are actually making war

39
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,600
It just means that a peacetime CEO as a CEO who's

40
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:13,360
Basically has something that's executing on a smooth keel and kind of needs to keep it forward

41
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:20,840
Moving forward and executing sort of smoothly. So if you look like in terms of Apple say Steve Jobs is as a wartime CEO

42
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,960
And Tim Cook is more of a peacetime CEO, right?

43
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:30,360
Which is not to say that he's not making tough decisions or tough choices every day, but he's not really

44
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:39,160
You know someone that you would want in there if their mission was to like entirely change what Apple is and so

45
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,000
To a certain extent when you're establishing any kind of a new regime, that's a kind of wartime

46
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,560
situation and so

47
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,440
You need someone that's a very very dynamic. That's willing to like rip up a lot of pieces of paper

48
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,920
and like a no say or a naysayer like somebody

49
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:05,640
Yeah, like or yeah, I mean, but even even you know, I would you call even must Elon Musk

50
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,680
You know a naysayer, you know, Elon Musk is someone with a lot of initiative who basically can make things happen and

51
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,640
You know the role of a peacetime CEO is sort of more to like preside over something that's working

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,880
Smoothly, which is why if you put someone like that in a position where large changes need to be made

53
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,880
You don't really have the right person

54
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,520
But you know the thing is that it's just not like we sort of

55
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,840
A company the job with this like mystical air in some ways and it's actually

56
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,080
It's a you know governing is or should be a pretty banal thing

57
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,800
It's like it's gotten sort of a lot of like

58
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,680
you know

59
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,520
Very big romantic ideas associated with it and there's a lot of power there

60
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,680
There's there's a lot of power there, but but the thing is that you know when when you

61
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,760
when you have

62
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,240
mechanisms for

63
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,680
putting someone in that power that basically sort of

64
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,040
depend on

65
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Like a kind of

66
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,080
Certain like if the sort of the main

67
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,200
Problem with a lot of the

68
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:46,760
A lot of 20th century governance has a very high crazy level and when you look at basically the very high crazy level of

69
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,360
20th century governance you basically see that

70
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,240
There are crazy incentives

71
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:01,280
Driving the way that people both get to make these decisions and crazy incentives driving them

72
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,000
when they're making these decisions and

73
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,480
Normally, it's best to see like the

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,440
People who wind up in those slots as kind of

75
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,920
Their craziness is in general constructed by those processes or those

76
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:31,040
You know sort of like their hands are sort of tie. Yeah, the climate or the structure their hands are sort of tied in terms of

77
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,000
how saying they can be and I think that people think of like

78
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,880
sort of

79
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,200
Like people have been exposed to so many

80
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,440
Romantic ideas of governance that they don't

81
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,080
Really even have an idea of what sanity is

82
00:06:52,080 --> 00:07:00,080
I mean, what is sanity for example for the CEO for an organization like Tesla for an organization like Ford?

83
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,280
There's a whole bunch of constraints that sort of immediately tie you

84
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,560
To a vision of the same, you know Tesla is not gonna go out

85
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,960
and

86
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,440
Invade the island of Haiti and like, you know

87
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,960
Re-enslave the Haitians and set them to making sugarcane. It's just not that is not going to happen

88
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,080
That is not within the realm of like saying things that Tesla could do Tesla is not going to say

89
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,240
Tomorrow we're gonna take over the dental floss business

90
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,880
We're gonna become the kings of dental floss like they're not gonna do this and and so

91
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,440
when you're in sort of like a

92
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:49,440
System and a structure that defines what sanity is whether you're Elon Musk or Elizabeth the first or Louis the 14th

93
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,000
You have like it's sort of

94
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:02,720
It feels like this much less sort of open-ended kind of crazy problem of like

95
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:10,360
Oh, we're gonna go crazy and invade the moon or like, you know, and and there's there's like there's a lot of things that

96
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,240
Washington does every day that are as crazy as invading the moon and when you look at the way

97
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,760
Those crazy things happen

98
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:26,040
It's not because of one or two crazy people actually generally the people involved in these things are like very

99
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,080
sensible and very good and very

100
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,920
You know

101
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,200
Yeah, practical down-to-earth people

102
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,240
Team players, you know, they're just basically in a system that makes them make, you know, crazy decisions

103
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:47,480
I mean for me the COVID thing because I'm a you know, believer in the in the lab leak theory of COVID is

104
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,400
such a perfect sort of case of like

105
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,320
We're gonna have these crazy incentives that basically leave us doing this extremely dangerous

106
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,360
gain-of-function research in this very very risky and unsafe way and

107
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,440
the

108
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,640
Because there's the government has taken on too much problems like with the company like Tesla

109
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:17,920
They have a very specific mandate and with the government. It's so open-ended. Is that where the craziness or the stochastic chaos is coming?

110
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,520
That's giving rise to these crazy ideas and behaviors. The the

111
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Like

112
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
I mean, you know

113
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,640
Even the question of what the mission of government is which seemed very obvious and very straight-forward

114
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,320
Sadie the Elizabethans has taken on all this sort of

115
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,120
Chili-astic and messianic kind of you know overtones

116
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,840
I mean even when you look at for example

117
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
when you dive into

118
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,240
Say a question like foreign policy, it's sort of dubious as to whether

119
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,120
There's sort of ever been any clear sanity guiding us foreign policy

120
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,880
I mean if you go and look for example at Washington's farewell address

121
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,040
Which you predict, you know the farewell address

122
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
I

123
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,400
Could but I'll just I'll just summarize it

124
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:28,280
You know his farewell address is sort of he's like reminding Americans that their foreign policy should be conducted in the you know

125
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,520
The interests of America and it's that he's expressing

126
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,800
it's it's one of the expressions of kind of what is sometimes called isolationist foreign policy and

127
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
he's basically

128
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:47,880
Sort of painting this picture very 18th century picture of a kind of wise approach to foreign policy and

129
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,000
You know, this is all very well, but you sort of read it and you're like

130
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,840
Why do you have to say this and the reason he had to say this and warned against basically

131
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,360
sort of

132
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,320
being

133
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,560
pulled into the quarrels of others and

134
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
Is that already?

135
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:15,160
Basically many Americans including the Americans who didn't really disagree didn't really agree with George Washington too much

136
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:24,040
We're very very eager to basically see the United States become the kind of world home base of revolutionary politics

137
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:30,680
And so right away you had this, you know, we've always been dreamers then or at least there

138
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:40,120
You had this incredibly wacky event with this guy's citizen Jenae who was the the French Revolutionary Ambassador to the US and basically

139
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:48,640
Made him made such a news made himself such a nuisance that he actually got kicked out was but was basically sort of proceeding on this plan and

140
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,280
The level of like support for the French Revolution

141
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,320
Even as sort of at its most

142
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,040
Sanguinary days

143
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,760
Was you know, you'll have all these lines from Jefferson where he's like the tree of you know

144
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,080
The tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of tyrants or like shit like that

145
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:13,280
You know where he's basically like, you know, he's like, ah, you know, he reacts to this insane shit in France where he's been

146
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,320
right by you got to kill a few people everyone's alright, you know, it's kind of creepy, right, you know and and

147
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
distinctly

148
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
reminiscent of

149
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,560
American sympathy for Stalin or for, you know, the Russian Revolution

150
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,120
I mean in 1848 there's this

151
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:39,160
Of course outright, you know sort of outbreak of almost what we would now call color revolutions across Europe and

152
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,320
This one character in Hungary this guy to soothe becomes the liberal leader of Hungary

153
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:52,840
Is then chased out by, you know, the Russian Russian troops help the Habsburgs reinstall themselves

154
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:01,440
Kuthu Kuthuth gets chased out and he becomes this massive public celebrity first in London and then in America

155
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:10,600
Where basically people are doing exactly the same thing with sort of the Hungarians in 1848 that they're doing say with the Ukrainians now

156
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,880
They're basically found, you know, they're sort of doing exactly what Washington was telling them not to do

157
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:23,800
They basically found the sort of foreign quarrel developed an emotionally interested and picked a side and

158
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,160
like, you know

159
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,520
gone

160
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,760
bananas over it. Do you think that has something to do with our culture then that we like to

161
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,320
Kind of embosom the world or we find a conflict that doesn't necessarily have to do with us

162
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,360
We just identify with that

163
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,320
Yeah, it's like a sick

164
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:49,960
Laticatorial, you know reflex. It's like if you remember the Arab Spring, right? You were probably excited about the Arab Spring

165
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:55,800
That was the bipartisan, you know, excitement. Everyone was excited about the Arab Spring and that's cool

166
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:01,600
The internet was doing it making waves, you know, Twitter. Yeah, I know I know I know I know and and this is like yeah

167
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,840
Twitter and Facebook were and you remember like Google guy in Egypt, right?

168
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:09,560
You know and that movement wind up killing about 500,000 to a million people

169
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,760
It did not cause the Civil War in Egypt, which it almost did which certainly would have killed a few more million people

170
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,880
It devastated Syria and Libya

171
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,920
And it was like it was sort of funny watching, you know, sort of the American

172
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,320
Democratic governance machine in a situation where

173
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,800
Public opinion and the deep state are really sort of completely aligned and we feel that we're doing this very clearly

174
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,400
unambiguously good thing

175
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,080
and then it just results in just like

176
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,880
horror and disaster as usual and

177
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
the

178
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,040
The response of people

179
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:58,000
There's sort of one test I use for like sanity in that situation

180
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:06,560
Which is kind of a good Samaritan test and if you're really acting as a as a good Samaritan in this case, let's say you

181
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,720
You're walking down the street and you see your horrific motorcycle accident

182
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:19,400
And you're the first one on this scene you run over to the guy. He's lying there in his motorcycle helmet. You like take his helmet off

183
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,240
Don't do that you made a mistake

184
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:29,200
Do not move the helmet of someone who's had a motorcycle accident because it turns out that you just broke his neck

185
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:35,040
And or he broke his neck, but you broke his spinal cord and paralyzed him for life. Let the MTS handle that one

186
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,360
Right, but you didn't right? You were trying to be nice

187
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,160
You were trying to help but you basically just inflicted this

188
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,680
Horridous life-changing thing on these people, right?

189
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:50,760
And so if you're basically doing that with the sort of the true spirit of charity and altruism

190
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,520
You're gonna be pretty beaten up about that. You're gonna think hard about wow

191
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:02,520
I was trying to help but instead I inflicted this crazy level of damage and

192
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,560
You would definitely never do something like that again and

193
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:15,360
But we don't as a country we work but with Arab Spring it was like, oh, this didn't work out. It's too bad

194
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,760
Let's change the channel, right? You know and so there's this sense of like

195
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,360
sort of

196
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:32,680
Deranged and irresponsible like power in a sense running free, you know, it's like when you compare say Libya

197
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,960
or the Libyan revolutionaries in

198
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,920
2012 or whenever it was to

199
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:49,000
sort of foreign policy of the past the thing that it instantly reminds you of is say the Spanish-American war or

200
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,720
Say the reunification of Italy by Garibaldi

201
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,920
Garibaldi certainly reunified Italy with his like 300 red shirts or whatever

202
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,080
but

203
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,120
That was a reconquer the kingdom of the two Sicilies with this 300 red shirts

204
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,560
Which was possible only because he had the British Navy right offshore declaring basically a no-sale zone

205
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,880
Whatever the equivalent was at the time, right? So it was this sort of act of

206
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,040
kind of somewhat naked

207
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:26,280
Imperialism and the result was a new unified Italy which was to some extent a British client state

208
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:32,760
Which offered a lot of new commercial opportunities to British merchants. You look at the Spanish-American war

209
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:40,720
It has all of these like, you know all this liberal rhetoric about how you know in the yellow press about how you know

210
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,920
The evil Spanish generals are abusing, you know fetching Cupid maidens and so forth

211
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:54,280
They really laid it on extremely thick and and like just like at a level of like blatancy. That's just utterly comical today

212
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,800
But on the other hand

213
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,960
So it was sort of this kind of high point of like liberal imperialism or like an attack on a foreign power

214
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,840
That was basically justified by sort of liberal thinking on the other hand

215
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,880
This liberal thinking resulted in basically the acquisition of Cuba the Philippines and Puerto Rico

216
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:23,160
Say what you want about Puerto Rico, but these are valuable properties basically and we're treated as valuable properties and

217
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:30,400
Returned much to like American colonialist investors and the United Fruit Company and so on and so forth

218
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,240
And so you basically look at that sort of liberal imperialism and you're like, okay

219
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,680
There's something predatory here clearly

220
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:47,840
You know from the perspective of Spain there's something very predatory going on here on the other hand like

221
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,200
What?

222
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,280
the US in 1898 killed it ate and

223
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,240
So it was like a dog like there's something ugly about it and there's something beautiful about it

224
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,800
It's like a wolf hunting a deer, you know, like, you know, this is only gonna end one way

225
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,480
You know, the wolf was gonna take down the deer and then the wolf was gonna eat, right?

226
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,040
And the thing is when you look at sort of the liberal imperialism of today

227
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,400
It's like

228
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
It's like a dog killing sheep

229
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,320
Like there's an instinct to like take out Gaddafi. There's an instinct to take out Assad

230
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,520
It feels great to have wheeled Obama and put it something on his teleprompter where he's like Assad must go

231
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,520
Boba bark must go Gaddafi must go

232
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:40,000
People understate the sort of power of American self-power to the point where if you will to bomb it out and had him say like

233
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,080
Merkel must go you could probably start a civil war in Germany that way

234
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:56,280
Just by just by basically saying we remove the moral authority from this regime that we have established and

235
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,400
If you basically yeah, I mean you could you know amazing things are possible with that shit

236
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,040
But

237
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:13,880
This liberal retric or this this liberal facade of generosity of caring is always hiding some sort of power play

238
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:20,920
Or you can't separate those two would it be better to just like it's like can't it can't it's an interesting question

239
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,080
It's like it's hiding

240
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,680
It's not really an absence of

241
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:36,040
Sincerity it's that it's sort of it's a thing that the sincerity kind of doesn't know itself

242
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:41,880
And so people think that they're genuinely sincere that what they're sort of doing is

243
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:50,160
Caring but what's actually sort of driving them and driving the structures there is

244
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,840
Something where when the effects of the caring are extremely bad and counterproductive

245
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,880
There's no caring about that

246
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:05,520
So in a way, it's like it's something that really wants to think of itself as kind of a duty of care

247
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:11,160
but you can also read it as this like perverse gladiatorial fascination and

248
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,080
You know this thing of like

249
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,280
We're using Ukraine to weaken Putin and we're gonna like fight to the last Ukrainian

250
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,960
I mean, it's like if you think you're doing a good thing for Ukraine

251
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,120
Excuse me the Ukraine here. If you think you're doing a good thing for the Ukraine you're already

252
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,960
Several hundred yards

253
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,680
Behind the goal line here

254
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,520
Like many bad things have already happened to Ukraine the Ukraine as a result of this policy

255
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,760
Of arming it to like basically as an anti-russian power

256
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,520
So you might say we're gonna get the 300 yards back and we're gonna get back to our own 20

257
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:58,160
But you've got you're you're not even in the stadium right now in terms of the damage you've inflicted on this country

258
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,400
and

259
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,840
You would say well the Ukrainians are into it. Well, yeah, I mean like

260
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,560
The Jedi mind powers of like the american

261
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
cosmopolitan ruling class

262
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,840
Are extremely great

263
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,040
and

264
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,600
If we went past sort of our current

265
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,000
Enthusiasm's into like

266
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,880
Some kind of full-on jim jones suicide cult

267
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,240
I feel like a lot of the chic people in

268
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,400
Warsaw and Kiev and levove would be committing suicide as well

269
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,880
I think that's sort of how powerful that kind of fashion dominance is in a way and so

270
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,840
and that was certainly the case with the

271
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,000
kind of

272
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,640
tiny fringes of sort of liberal elite who

273
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:55,680
Were very into the arab spring. Also. It's like wow civil society in libya or civil civil society in egypt is going to get a huge boost

274
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,160
Um, and they didn't but you could see where they were sort of coming from

275
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,880
with that and so

276
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,040
that we just like with

277
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,080
I don't know. I don't want to get into european

278
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,680
History or something, but I'm just thinking we inflict that on ourselves through

279
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,760
Wokeness or dei training

280
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,640
It seems like with the black lives matter event like the liberal

281
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,440
Cosmopolitan elite was all on board with defunding the police. We're going to liberate these

282
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:28,160
These these areas of our own country and now those areas are completely decimated by yeah, all of them

283
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:35,200
Well, I mean, yeah, I mean it wasn't rhetoric doesn't actually translate into hoping it wasn't I mean it wasn't the first time

284
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,360
I mean if you look at

285
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,680
basically

286
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,520
60 years ago

287
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,520
Every major american city

288
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,560
Had like a thriving black business district. It had a thriving black upper class residential district

289
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,440
You know in those areas of general are burned out now and that was basically

290
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,200
something that happened in the late 60s and early 70s

291
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,040
and

292
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,040
You know the connection between

293
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,360
that and

294
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,360
the civil rights movement which

295
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:13,680
Americans saw on their TVs and supported with great enthusiasm seems to be sort of rather

296
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Direct in a way

297
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,520
And so you're basically

298
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,080
again

299
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,800
Looking at something where if you're like

300
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,720
Wow

301
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,440
Let's say i'm like flying a drone over urban african-american areas

302
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:39,680
In like 1962 and 2022 what i'm going to observe with my eyes is that these areas have been like

303
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,480
decimated and so I would basically assume that

304
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,560
Sometime in the 60s some kind of radical anti-black party had come to power

305
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:59,040
Maybe the klu Klux Klan had won the election in 68 and that would explain why these areas had been systematically destroyed

306
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:07,040
Right and that's not indeed what happened. You know what happened was actually the opposite of that what happened was that

307
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,440
basically

308
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,560
A set an aspect of america that hadn't gotten a whole lot of attention or sympathy

309
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,320
Or this or you know empathy you might say

310
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,440
Receive that and the result of this emotion was

311
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,480
seemed to be and you know

312
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,960
just to

313
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,800
A physical observer of the people in the places

314
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,000
Seems to be a great deal of destruction

315
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,840
and

316
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,840
the mentality of

317
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,440
Like our intentions are good our hearts are pure and so we don't really have to think about

318
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,160
The destruction that we're causing or the destruction that results here

319
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,040
is not

320
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,240
The way that people whose hearts are pure think

321
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:03,040
And so at no point under any of these examples to the people who are taking off the bike helmet

322
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:08,480
Actually have to deal with the severed spine or recognize that they're at fault for doing that

323
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,680
It doesn't seem yes. That's capable or the system itself

324
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,520
There are the liberal

325
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,840
There's culture just can't see they're they're they're motivated by like there's something that

326
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,960
is very similar

327
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,080
to empathy and sort of easily

328
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:34,320
Masquerades as it but like drives out the real thing. It's like a kind of gresham's law where bad money drives out good

329
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,800
bad empathy drives out good empathy

330
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:45,360
And so, you know, one of the ways to think about well, you know, you're like, what is this bad empathy?

331
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,360
What is this thing that

332
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,080
is like empathy, but is not empathy and

333
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:57,520
It reminds me of this etymological fact that I love that I always quote, which is the etymology of the word lord

334
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,880
Lord is an old anglo-saxon word and it comes from

335
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,280
cloth ward

336
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,280
Which means the cloth is

337
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,920
loaf

338
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,600
as in bread

339
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:19,920
And the ward is ward is in guard as in basically so your lord is basically he who guards your bread

340
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,120
he who gives you this day your daily bread and

341
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,760
If you're feeding someone you basically are his lord

342
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,440
because even if you don't care to tell him what to do you could

343
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,680
And you could say if you don't do this, I'm not gonna feed you

344
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,760
and so the sort of, you know, basically the sense that you have of like

345
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,360
Caring for others is like closely entwined with the sense

346
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,920
of being lord over them

347
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,920
and

348
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:58,320
You know, certainly as a parent like you feel that very closely like the the sort of the care and the dependency

349
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,200
Are all very much tied together

350
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,120
and so

351
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,240
in a way when people adopt these sort of, you know

352
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,240
The mindset that supports these kinds of foreign policies, they sort of

353
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,440
Acquiring or domestic policies. They're sort of acquiring clients in a way

354
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,480
They're sort of feeling themselves become more powerful

355
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,640
Because they're feeling themselves owning others by caring for others

356
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,720
it's it's actually

357
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,760
it's

358
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,280
represented on twitter the people who put ukraine flags in their bio are kind of claiming ukraine as their own in a way

359
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,800
They're claiming ukraine as absolutely. They're claiming ukraine as their as their position and they don't really understand

360
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,440
Yeah, as their vassal state, right, you know, and they sort of don't understand like

361
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,040
because they've sort of only been exposed to

362
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,240
Imperialism as a caricature

363
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,880
They don't really understand how close this is to

364
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,880
The way that actual imperialists thought

365
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,600
And so yeah, white man's burden kind of classic. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah white man's burden, right? And so basically

366
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,240
you know, they're they're taking up the

367
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,280
You know, the the the white man's burden when they put the ukraine flag in their

368
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,320
In their thing, I mean, you know, of course raises the question of whether slobs are white

369
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,640
But um, you know, we don't we don't have to go into that

370
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,880
Add the mulligy of slave if you want to hey, there you go. There you go. Right, right, right, right?

371
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,120
And now it's like they wear these track suits. They have this like squat, you know the

372
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:37,040
I mean, you know, I don't know if you know that like some of the rhetoric, you know, the sort of ukrainian russian rhetoric is absolutely

373
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,040
Deranged and the word more deranged than our blue red rhetoric

374
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:48,080
Yes, because the slur that ukrainians have picked up on that they

375
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,680
Used for russian is orcs

376
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,840
Literally orcs. They stole it from tolkin, right?

377
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,520
And so they basically think of them as like subhuman creatures from the east

378
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,200
And and one of the things that triggered the original revolt in the donbas in 2014

379
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:09,040
Was basically as soon as the kind of western ukrainians got control of the ukrainian state

380
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,400
They started passing all of these like anti russian laws

381
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,280
Like you have to like not speak russian and like change your name to like the funny looking ukrainian spelling

382
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,520
And you'll see pictures on yes, so they did a cultural genocide

383
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,480
Yeah, that's a strong genocide

384
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:32,400
It's basically yeah, it's the sort of thing that basically you do to a cultural, you know minority that you basically want to kind of

385
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,040
You know bring into line, you know, you could compare it if you were feeling generous to like the way

386
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:45,680
That like northern france treated southern france like 500 600 years ago, right, you know, and and and it's like the

387
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:54,080
And and so you'll see pictures one of the old folk punishments or whatever which gets used a lot

388
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,760
In ukraine is tying people to trees

389
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,800
And so I don't know if you go around you'll see in twitter people tied to trees or telephone poles

390
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,360
And sometimes their faces have been painted green to show that there are orcs

391
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,480
Um, this would be like I don't think that like

392
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,080
Speaking russian is not going to do that but like basically you're being accused of being a russian sympathizer

393
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:23,200
So it's just this like, you know, you go into like the inside of this war and there's just like insane shit everywhere, right?

394
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:29,920
You know and and needless to say the people with ukrainian flags in their in their twitter handles

395
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,640
Would probably never tie anyone to a tree and paint their face green for speaking the wrong language

396
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:39,360
But like that that was probably not really in their like bag of tricks

397
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,200
Like at all really but like that's sort of what they're

398
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:50,240
When they basically sort of picked sides in this like nationalistic Balkan basically fight

399
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,320
I'm sure all all ukrainians would be insulted by my use of the word Balkan

400
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,880
But you know the the like, you know, you're just doing this like

401
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,520
There's this level at what

402
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,960
Where what you're doing is this kind of

403
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:12,400
Gladiatorial spectator thing and like to like sort of step sort of all the way

404
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,280
back, right

405
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,680
It's like when

406
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:26,720
You know, you look at the foreign policy that's driven this where you know, there were these constant promises made to like not expand NATO

407
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:32,080
And then it's like, oops. Sorry. It looks like we're expanding NATO, right, you know and the

408
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,320
like the sense of

409
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,040
A driving force behind this kind of foreign policy

410
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,440
Which is not in any way the force of reason

411
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,160
Is like you're just like it's sort of it's just like power is flowing

412
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,320
Into wherever it wants to go and it's sort of reminiscent

413
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,760
There's a lot of this kind of foreign policy that's like very reminiscent of the frog in the scorpion, right?

414
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,960
where basically it's just sort of

415
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:12,880
The nature of this whole system, which includes both the

416
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,920
bureaucrats who run it and the sort of supporters of it who basically like

417
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,760
Have these incentives to basically cause trouble and create problems

418
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,880
And they don't see it that way. That is not their framework. They're basically

419
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:36,480
Trying to like create freedom, but their sense of freedom is basically they see one stone on top of another

420
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,680
And they're like we must liberate the stone on the bottom

421
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,600
And so, you know, sort of freedom is kind of becomes

422
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,640
indistinguishable from

423
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,960
a kind of like destruction and so

424
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,680
You look at basically the like things that

425
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,000
like

426
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,600
When you compare for example, afghanistan to vietnam

427
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,480
you know, basically

428
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,400
The

429
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,000
first of all afghanistan is run by people who's like

430
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,560
Formative experience was the lessons learned from vietnam

431
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,720
And just in terms of like age cohort. They didn't seem to learn any lesson at all and like

432
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,600
vietnam

433
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,320
afghanistan makes vietnam looks sane and

434
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:31,680
Like it made vietnam looks sane. It was just like all of us. We're never gonna get the you know full metal jacket movies

435
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,240
It's never gonna be romanticized or yeah. Yeah, and and there's no like, you know

436
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,040
It's like when you look at sort of for example

437
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,400
Like the reality of the south vietnamese government is like much realer than the afghan government

438
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,880
Like the level of like, you know

439
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,840
Sort of just like everything about

440
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:57,280
Vietnam you can sort of find ways to look at the vietnam effort where you're like, okay, there's certain ways

441
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,800
Ultimately in the end this didn't make sense and it didn't work

442
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,800
But you can kind of see

443
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,200
Here are things that made sense that like this was maybe like close to

444
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,920
And you can't even find out for afghanistan and so you have just like all of these things whether it's like

445
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,040
invading afghanistan and

446
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:22,560
Trying to like, you know for 20 years. We're there for spending 20 years in this comical

447
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,480
ridiculous ineffective attempt to turn it into vermont or something

448
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,320
And maybe we would have been happy with florida

449
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,240
Maybe we could have been happy. Maybe we could have been happy with oklahoma

450
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,600
Maybe we could have been happy with guam, but no, you know, we needed we needed the vermont concept of you know

451
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,160
The bennington concept of human rights, you know, and and and like and so, you know

452
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,280
We had all these bennington grads going and teaching like, you know, very, you know

453
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,760
In gender rights, whatever

454
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:56,240
Poetry workshops, right, you know, exactly and and um nothing wrong with a good poetry workshop

455
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:03,360
But you know like everything has its place and and the I mean they love they love I mean in the taliban actually writing

456
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:10,560
Poems is like a qualification for leadership, right? But is it is it? It is it is it is a very good volume

457
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:16,800
There's a yes, there's a volume of like translated taliban poetry. That's actually not too bad if you're into it's all of course

458
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,600
From a taliban perspective, right? You know, it's not really

459
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,160
Not really gonna appeal to the

460
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:27,840
It's like there's this there's this other great book that i'm a huge fan of um called zen at war

461
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:34,400
Which was written by like a california hippie zen dude like in the 80s or 90s or something where he realizes that

462
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,400
All of these zen masters many of whom came over to like california because they smelled a good thing and like

463
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,960
After you know the 40s 50s 60s, but in like the 30s and 40s these guys are in japan

464
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,520
They're in imperial japan, right? So he's like what is zen like?

465
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,280
um

466
00:36:53,280 --> 00:37:00,960
In imperial japan and he basically finds all these like and he just quotes these things with it's just the outrage where they're just like, you know

467
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:09,280
The feeling of zen is the feeling of a chinese soldier's head trapping from his body as the perfect swords

468
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,440
like i mean, right, you know

469
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,040
And like, you know, there's just you know, nothing is more zen than the mom that are killing right, you know or

470
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,440
and

471
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,320
It just reminds you of the sort of protean nature of this religion which can be sort of like

472
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:31,280
california hippies and and you know imperial desk wads, uh, you know equally well and and and

473
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,680
I'm sure these zen and tally bone the tally bone. Yeah, right. And so yeah, there's definitely

474
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,400
I mean there's something poetic and beautiful about martyrdom operations or whatever you want to call it

475
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,120
Well, or you have to have a poetic sense of

476
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,200
Reality in order to sure

477
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,080
I mean, and you know, you listen you listen to isis videos. They're all like, you know, nashid's

478
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:58,880
Which are um, you know acapella singing that, you know, uh, salafi islam's like, okay, you can have music

479
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,280
But no instruments. Yeah, so you have these basically nashid's which are like

480
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,040
Sort of the taliban al qaeda equivalent of like the narco corrido

481
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:12,240
If you know that mexican genre like the drug drug narco music from northern mexico

482
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,280
Like that celebrates like, you know, the the achievements of great drug lords

483
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,640
Um, and they have that for basically martyrs and so forth. And I mean, it's it's beautiful

484
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,800
Anyway, there's this very good volume with have translated taliban poetry, but um,

485
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,920
Yeah, you know, definitely like feminist poetry workshops are not really the thing

486
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,880
It's gonna turn kandahar into into bennington

487
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,640
And and so you basically, you know, they had their chance, right?

488
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,560
You know, if it was gonna work, it was gonna work. It probably would have worked by now

489
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,960
And and so when we basically, um

490
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,240
Kind of pull the camera back and we look at basically

491
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,920
Just like the level of just weird

492
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,480
insane shit

493
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,320
That dc does that nobody even thinks about like how weird and insane it is

494
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:14,000
You're at a like, you know, people will be like, well, the u.s. government's lorotic and, you know, slow and bumbling and bureaucratic

495
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:19,120
But so is ibm. I'm like, yeah, okay. Yes. ibm is like this, but like

496
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:25,760
Waters of magnitude my friends, like, you know, like and and so they're just like whole

497
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:33,040
You know, it's like another great dc example is you remember 9 11 probably

498
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:39,120
Looks like you were a little younger than me at that time. But um, they came up they came up with this

499
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,960
You're you're looking good. Um, the um, um

500
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,160
The the keeping that brown hair is very important

501
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:54,640
He got great locks too. Yeah. Yeah, as soon as as soon as I start getting bald. That's all coming off

502
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,240
But um, I will not be one of those people but you know, the um, it's good a good hat

503
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,440
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, right. Um, but just like the

504
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,040
the sheer

505
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,040
like

506
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,560
The will like the the sheer like the yeah, I mean the example I was thinking of is that

507
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:21,040
So we have this term national security that was basically

508
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:26,560
It's a world war two term and what was decided, you know, basically

509
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,920
I think there's this line from roosevelt where he's basically like

510
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:38,320
Any political events anywhere in the world are relevant to us national security. This is basically this isn't the second

511
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,640
Yeah, this is this is franklin, right? And so

512
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,800
basically it somehow came about that basically

513
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,960
part of the american kind of political

514
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,320
Creed became that to keep america safe. We have to rule the world

515
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,520
But you say even washington even george washington had already noticed that that is our tendency

516
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:04,320
There's something and exactly the way we look at the world is that there's something there's this sort of weird

517
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,920
Yeah, there's this weird vicarious like hunger

518
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,560
That basically becomes

519
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,000
People really don't feel it as the will to dominate it

520
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,680
But it becomes the will to dominate and then it's sort of that will to dominate

521
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,520
Enter as all of these institutions and become sort of part of the unconscious

522
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,320
Creed of these institutions

523
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,760
And then the us is actually attacked in

524
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,000
2001

525
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,200
And so

526
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,120
Then they have to come up with this term homeland security

527
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:44,720
Which means national security but not national security because that word is already taken, right?

528
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,960
And so they come up with this weird nazi sounding term homeland, right? You know homeland, right?

529
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,640
At least it's genderless, right?

530
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,160
At least it's genderless, right?

531
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,440
You know haimath, right?

532
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:03,760
You know and and it's just like it's it's and and you're like you would say national security except that word is already taken

533
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:10,000
For meaning something which it doesn't mean, right? And so you have all these incredible like

534
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,040
distortions of like

535
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,040
There are all these convoluted ways of thinking that are sort of

536
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,920
spread to the population

537
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,360
from

538
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:27,760
You know these assumptions that are hidden deep in our these assumptions that are sort of came out of some weird

539
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,120
Historical structure that get embedded in everything. You know, it's sort of like the

540
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,960
You know the

541
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:42,720
I think people have traced like the six foot social disc both the six foot social distancing thing

542
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,360
And the paper straw thing and people have been like where did this come from?

543
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,480
And they actually found like high school science projects

544
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,360
That were basically the source of this shit, right?

545
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,000
You know and and like it doesn't matter anymore

546
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,640
But you still have all you know all these circles on the floor where there's six feet social distancing thing

547
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:08,400
Which is absolutely and utterly and profoundly unscientific as like, you know, I mean it took these these just

548
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,560
In like the specific area of the

549
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,320
WHO

550
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:18,480
Had this bias for bizarre historical scientific reasons

551
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,400
Against thinking of viruses as airborne, right?

552
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:28,640
And so you basically had this where the six feet comes from was this whole like droplet theory

553
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:34,000
Which was shown to be completely incorrect like which never made any godium sense

554
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,720
And was shown to be completely incorrect very early in the pandemic

555
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,160
And it took

556
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,640
WHO like a year and a half to be like well, I guess maybe it might be airborne, right?

557
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:52,160
Meanwhile in japan, they're like, okay, you know, like better ventilation is like the solution here because it's obviously airborne

558
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:59,520
Right and they had some sort of native bureaucracy there which could kind of make up its own mind

559
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,400
But the mindset's the point is that basically when you're looking at the way

560
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,440
this system does government

561
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,240
it has

562
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,400
embedded in it a lot of

563
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:19,840
Extremely bizarre assumptions. Okay. It's like it's like it's like English language where you have these weird words that are just floating around

564
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:24,320
That mean nothing like what they what they came from or yeah, or just something strange

565
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:31,680
conjugations like the oxen, you know, and you're just like you can go in the past and you can say oh well

566
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,040
this came from

567
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:39,520
The dynamics of world war two or like this came from like somebody's high school project about plastic straws, you know

568
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,200
and

569
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,200
watch like how

570
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:51,920
I mean, I guess my sort of point going back to your original question about monarchy is that

571
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,520
Sort of people are always like they sort of believe in the wisdom or not even the wisdom

572
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,080
But like the sanity of crowds and they're like

573
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,920
One person could be completely mental and start poisoning the burritos or doing them, you know

574
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,680
um

575
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:13,600
And then but if you have like a community of the smartest best people making the decision

576
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,120
Like how could that go wrong? Like who?

577
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Why should like some king who however he was chosen?

578
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:26,800
Maybe he was just born to be king like and he's making the decisions about virology

579
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,960
Shouldn't the virologist make the decisions about virology and like, you know

580
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,400
The idea that the virologist should make the decisions about virology seems extremely logical

581
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,000
and sensible a confederacy of experts is what we

582
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:45,840
Yeah, I want and it eventually gets you to covet 19 because it basically

583
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,560
Creates incentives

584
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,080
in within that network of experts where

585
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,240
They basically are in a position position to say well

586
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,960
We need funding to do our work

587
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,160
Um, the more important we are the more funding we get

588
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,920
Therefore it is important for us to find important emerging threats which could be threatening

589
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:13,760
So let's basically go and collect all the bat viruses while these bat viruses can't you know

590
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,360
Normally infect people because they're bat viruses, but what if they mutated to jump to humans?

591
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,520
That would be very dangerous and scary

592
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,360
Um, let's examine how they could mutate to jump to humans

593
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,880
Uh, well, how could we do that? We could just create some

594
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:36,960
Examples create some examples, right? You know and and basically you're just like not, you know, um

595
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:43,120
Realizing in the process of this process of this that you're doing exactly what the like

596
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,000
Dr. Chernobyl did when he's like we got to figure out if this nuclear reactor is safe

597
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:53,280
Our theory is that if we turn off all the safety systems and run full power

598
00:46:53,920 --> 00:47:02,080
We'll still be safe, right? You know and and and like that's basically what you're doing when you collect these guiding bat viruses, right? And and like

599
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,880
so

600
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:10,160
Scientists aren't adapted to power power adapts scientists to itself

601
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:15,040
So so scientists are focused on on on making science or even even trying to

602
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,760
Solve a problem with regards to health

603
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,080
But power itself exerts a shape onto how the science

604
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,880
Happens and what what decisions each end up coming out of and it mutates

605
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:32,240
And it mutates the culture of science eventually and so basically

606
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,640
to become

607
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:41,040
We think of scientists as these people driven by pure curiosity puttering around in their labs

608
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:47,280
Like some, you know, 19th century like, you know, vicar or something that or alchemist studies

609
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,880
studies beetles under a microscope, you know, and

610
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:57,360
That person is driven entirely by their curiosity and wonder and lefren

611
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,480
And these are the things that cause people to get into science

612
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:06,480
But the thing is is once you're in science you discover that it's just actually like

613
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,400
Very very cut through a bureaucracy and you have to basically be

614
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,000
A good operator in that bureaucracy and the people

615
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:24,640
Who turn out to be the best at that are often somewhat mediocre scientists and really world-class bureaucrats

616
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:30,800
And so you basically sort of everything kind of gets twisted in this direction

617
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,520
Of like

618
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,840
Yeah, I need to justify my importance and the thing is

619
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,800
Most fields are not such that

620
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,800
You can actually create the problems that you're there to solve but like

621
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,560
A virus that goes around the world and kills. Yeah, virology is kind of an exception to that

622
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:59,600
And so basically these people were, you know, it's like the the classic dc example is the self-licking ice cream cone

623
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,480
Right, but this was like a toxic self-licking ice cream cone

624
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,880
It's like a self-licking ice cream cone is like

625
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:09,280
A something whose solution only exists to like solve itself like, you know

626
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,240
Like you don't even get the lick the ice cream that licks itself, right, you know

627
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:17,040
But but in this case it was a toxic self-licking ice cream cone and you look at basically

628
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,840
The bureaucratic incentives

629
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,720
Which caused that

630
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:28,640
To happen or I think caused that to happen because why would there be such a cover-up when there was nothing to cover up?

631
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,640
right and

632
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,520
the

633
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,240
Yeah, if reputation didn't matter nobody would have to lie

634
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,440
Yeah, right and and and there's clearly

635
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:45,280
Yes, there's clearly some bad dealing there and like obviously nobody involved in this research wants to admit that this is what happened

636
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,200
right and

637
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,200
And so in every instance

638
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,600
It's it's power that's directing everything

639
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:56,480
Whether it's it's under the guise of saving the world from this problem or liberating this country over here

640
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:01,120
There's always power eventually is always operating under the surface because that's eventually what

641
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:09,280
Happens is and power and power power corrupts things and so basically when you had I mean the way we got

642
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,920
to give sort of

643
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,320
academic models of policy

644
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:20,080
So much power in the 20th century is we started the 20th century in a world

645
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:24,240
Where power was largely actually held by corrupt politicians

646
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:29,360
And that like gilded age country worked a lot the like the way china works today in some ways

647
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,960
It wasn't a dictatorship

648
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:37,760
But it was a country in which everything was very very corrupt and was done very quickly in this ugly way power was directed

649
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:43,200
Specifically toward not necessarily the common good, but doing a work, right? It wasn't directed

650
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,600
It was something more solid perhaps it had a kind of corruption

651
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,280
I mean the kind of corruption that existed there

652
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,400
Or exists in china today was like

653
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:59,520
If the street gets built it may be cost 30 percent more than it should have cost

654
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,080
But it does get built um and but like the level of um

655
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,040
you know

656
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:12,880
There was also like there was yeah, and and so what happened early in the 20th century

657
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:18,560
was sort of the beginnings of what we call the progressive movement at that time was that basically

658
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,240
america's hereditary aristocracy

659
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,280
looked at this stuff and

660
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,280
basically saw

661
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,280
that people who

662
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,960
were

663
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,400
Dumber and less sophisticated than them were in charge

664
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,120
And like this is where we get, you know, one of the things I love to cite is this

665
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,200
bizarre

666
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,280
Sort of disconnect between

667
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,640
You know, we have if you think about the two words

668
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,440
democracy and politics

669
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:55,760
You'll notice that democracy has very very positive connotations and politics has very very negative connotations

670
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,240
but they're actually synonyms

671
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:05,040
And like how do you have politics without democracy or democracy without and specifically I've heard you say this but

672
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:11,040
What helped me understand it better was when you talk about populism is basically yeah, right or between democracy

673
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:16,800
politics is populism which populism is kind of a synonym for like putting politicians in charge

674
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,080
and putting politicians in you know who

675
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,920
Appeal to like what the public wants in charge

676
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,760
Is literally the meaning of representative democracy?

677
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,720
and so one of the things that basically

678
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:37,840
The progressive movement did is it said we're going to treat representative democracy sort of the way

679
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:45,520
The modern uk treats its monarchy. We're going to still have these elections, but we're going to make sure

680
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:51,840
That basically it's really traditional and important and constitutional and necessary

681
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,560
For the president to not really be in charge of the executive branch

682
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:03,520
Because if the president is like can tell doj who to prosecute like yeah, my god, right?

683
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:08,960
You know and so it's like saying queen elizabeth the second could say off with her head, right?

684
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:14,080
You know elizabeth the first could be like off of his head, but like elizabeth the second like

685
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,120
In theory she has the same job, right?

686
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,480
But in practice it's very very different and so

687
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,760
So the aristocracy re-exerted itself or the which would be the oligarchy

688
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:31,120
Or yeah, right right and sort of created this kind of institutional oligarchy

689
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,560
You know the word meritocracy has been used

690
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,520
Is that is that a cynical take meritocracy? That's a whole other discussion

691
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,280
It was originally in the in the original book by michael young

692
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,000
It was sort of meant as a cynical take

693
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,880
Okay, um, you know merit is a tough

694
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,640
Prove yourself to this particular

695
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:53,840
organization

696
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:59,120
But like prove your intelligence or prove that you have a degree from the right school or prove

697
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:03,120
Or you can jump through the de i hoops and do your equity statement in the right way

698
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:10,480
Yeah, right, right, right. It's it's it's sort of drifted, you know drifted away from merit or from any

699
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:19,440
Um ability to do something in the world that's productive other than yeah be a bureaucrat basically right right right right, um

700
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,880
Yeah, so so like the um

701
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,880
Um

702
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:31,920
Yeah, so so you have this in and you have this situation in which whenever you basically take something that hasn't been

703
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:36,080
You know power corrupts and when you take something that hasn't been

704
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,400
Corrupted by power such as america's beautiful universities

705
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:45,440
100 years ago and you say well, why not give these smart and reasonable people power

706
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,480
Surely they won't be corrupted by it in any way

707
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,840
and like basically

708
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,400
by giving

709
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:59,120
Sort of all these sciences of government real power over government

710
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,680
You've basically wound up, you know

711
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:09,200
Like you needed a valve in that so that the sewage didn't flow up into the drinking water and the sewage has definitely gotten into the drinking water

712
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:15,040
Yeah, um and and so like even virology it turns out can be corrupted by power

713
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,800
Because nobody got into virology because they wanted to cause a pandemic

714
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,920
Like, you know, this was not done by like evil scientists like, you know

715
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,080
um

716
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:29,680
Like this was done by people who were doing

717
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,480
What cune called normal science?

718
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,120
They were basically being like, oh, yeah

719
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:39,440
And like covet has only increased the funding that's going in this direction now

720
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,480
They're like see emerging viruses can cause huge problems

721
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:47,440
We really need to make sure we catch all the pokemon and so we're going to wow and go

722
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:53,040
We're going to go into the bat caves and get more bad viruses and play with them more and like

723
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:59,920
It's a sort of there's a counter example to that is the tsa being erected in the wake of 9 11

724
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Like I don't know if that's increased

725
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:06,480
terrorism itself, but it it the government tapped into this way of uh, you know

726
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,280
Just swallowed this huge

727
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:14,160
Industry of checking people going through airports, right and now it's just an institution, right?

728
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:18,560
It doesn't necessarily cause more terrorism, but it's now it's just a waste of time and resources

729
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:25,280
Yeah, no no no and you're seeing some of that with the the covid control that will will will keep up forever basically

730
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,280
um

731
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,080
the

732
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:33,120
Yeah, I mean that's that's like that's sort of the self-licking ice cream cone sort of in its

733
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:38,320
Harmless sense where you have this thing and you know, um, take your shoes off

734
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:43,040
Take your shoes off because yeah, right, right, right, right and and like the

735
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,000
um, you know, I don't think that

736
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,880
Taking your shoes off and dumping your water is responsible for the like the death of terrorism

737
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:56,480
Or the death so far never never counted out, right? But um, no, I think that

738
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:04,720
You know going going around killing people has done a lot of that. Um, but you know, so it's like you can I mean

739
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:11,920
There's always a sort of defense for like you can sort of be like, yeah, let's you know

740
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:20,240
Defend the theory that the u.s. Needs to be the world's policeman because otherwise, you know, somebody else would or like they're always like

741
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,000
You know, nothing's quite black and white

742
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:28,800
but the essential point that I sort of want to make is that

743
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:33,680
If you're talking about a complete reset of like the meaning

744
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,320
and purpose

745
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,000
of government

746
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,680
you're talking about

747
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,680
something where like

748
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,400
You have a lot of answers to a lot of questions that basically

749
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:54,560
Date to are like really old and just happening by inertia or camera is something weird like the high school science fair

750
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,960
or like, you know, and the need for kind of

751
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:04,560
Reconsidering all of these questions in like a reasonable way

752
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,720
is like

753
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,240
the

754
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,240
fundamental driving

755
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,440
force

756
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:16,960
For imagining a completely different regime. Yeah, and it's sort of hard to know

757
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:23,600
There's sort of no obvious collective at all in the world that could make these kinds of

758
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,480
Decisions or choices

759
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,000
Collectively

760
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,920
So I I'm bringing this up because I'm pretty sure you're gonna shoot it down

761
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,640
But with the advent of the internet, uh, substack

762
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:40,320
Let's say that the brief phenomenon of what was called the intellectual dark web just as a concept just as a concept

763
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,720
There could be the case that the prestige makers or the king makers which

764
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:52,000
Resided in the new york times and in harvard could switch online to these independent content creators that build up reputations and then

765
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,920
bestow

766
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,920
prestige on

767
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,320
various different policies or various different

768
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,720
politicians, right if we

769
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:06,560
Because if you look at like the new york times of the washington post or harvard, they're spewing out all this bullshit

770
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,440
You know all this we call it wokeness, but there's just a lot of bullshit

771
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,920
It seems like they're they're expending their reputation. They're not making sense anymore more or less

772
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:20,800
So they're their prestigious going down will not the prestige somehow democratically through the marketplace of attention

773
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:27,600
Somehow replace that prestige mechanism that gives us the oligarchy that that shelves up the oligarchy

774
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,640
It's a good question. I think the problem is that sort of power is always prestigious

775
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,680
And the thing is you sort of you want

776
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:41,760
You really want this kind of level playing field on which sense outcompetes nonsense

777
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:47,600
And you basically look at this playing field and you're like, why does nonsense kind of regularly outcompete?

778
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:52,000
Sense and it's because the nonsense is powerful and the sense is not

779
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,560
And if you basically

780
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:57,760
If you even just take sort of isolationism

781
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,720
via versus internationalism

782
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,680
Um isolation versus globalism if you want to use two pejoratives there

783
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,240
um

784
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,400
What you see is that

785
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:18,240
There's much much more power in the active thing because the active thing basically is like

786
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,440
We must hire a lot of people to govern the world

787
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,920
We must think very hard about governing the world

788
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:28,240
Whereas isolationism is the reverse that isolationism is like

789
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:34,000
Hey, there's 50 000 of america's like smartest people in the state department. Do we need them? Why?

790
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,840
right and

791
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,840
And this sense of and so

792
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,480
Is it really that big it's 50 000 people

793
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:45,680
Something like that's a little smaller. I think it depends. I don't not that many fsos, but there's a lot of

794
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,560
Yeah, it's huge, right, you know, and I mean you're governing the world man, you know, like

795
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:57,760
The indirectly someone but you're governing the world so like the sense of

796
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,960
like what it

797
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,240
Takes to

798
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:05,360
like

799
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,240
There's sort of no situation under which

800
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,240
the

801
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,760
idea that

802
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:17,840
Is not a source of power is going to outcompete the idea that is a source of power naturally

803
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,240
Or it's like you're like, okay. Yeah

804
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,960
Harvard like

805
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:28,080
Like you might as an intellectual as a critic

806
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,960
Start to develop a community of people who have a low opinion of harvard

807
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:41,200
But how is that community of people going to develop the endowment the cultural capital the like regime capital?

808
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,840
like, you know to like

809
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:49,920
You're not really talking about a private institution when you you're talking about harvard and the new york times

810
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,240
You're talking about if these things were officially parts of the government

811
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:59,440
They'd be instantly recognizable as the most important and powerful parts of the government

812
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:06,720
Right and and so the question is while while the governor the trust in the government and the trust in harvard the trust in

813
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:12,320
The washington or the the new york times all these all these legacy institutions. They're they're spewing bullshit

814
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:16,880
They're spewing the stuff that doesn't make sense. They're but the trust doesn't come from their

815
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,240
Like ability to make sense their reputation

816
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,920
their reputation their prestige ultimately

817
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,160
Does not come from that reputation

818
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:32,320
There's a lot of things that they have to do to maintain that prestige

819
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,200
And there's certainly a lot of sort of prestige generating things

820
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:42,400
That happen there and they certainly do select a lot of very smart people

821
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:45,040
even though, you know

822
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,520
Admissions are what they are

823
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,840
but the like

824
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,560
The sort of

825
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:56,960
There's no way to offshore that to the internet. Yeah, there's there's no way there's no way

826
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:00,080
Yeah, there's no way for sort of this like 90s dream

827
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,400
of like people

828
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:07,600
Without any status or power competing with that because basically the

829
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,640
like

830
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:19,600
The ingredient the active ingredient is basically inertial the active ingredient union is that harvard is harvard and you're not

831
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:25,760
and like your ability to sort of crack into that business is like, I mean

832
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,800
You know, it's like there's a list of um

833
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,760
You know the top 14 law schools. I don't know why it's 14. It is 14

834
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,240
Why is it 500 fortune?

835
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:41,520
If you go, I don't know the length of the original at least it's at least it's the round number

836
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:47,040
The top 14 law schools have been the same top 14 law schools for the last 50 years

837
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:53,200
they're selected by something called us news and world report which used to be a magazine of some kind and

838
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,200
They haven't changed in the last 50 years and by the way, if you're going to law school and you're not getting a top 14 degree

839
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,760
useless don't do it and

840
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,600
You'll find yourself doing like discovery work or like shit work, right?

841
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:10,640
You know, only the top 14 law schools are real law schools, right? So, you know, basically

842
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:14,240
How do you break into that? Like

843
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:20,400
It's just no way just to think of it as basically part of the government and then you're just like when you ask the question

844
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,200
Of how does this change?

845
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,080
Or how is this shut down?

846
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,720
you will not expect

847
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:36,160
automatic automatic market mechanisms to do that for you because actually the market loves the stenershia

848
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:37,760
um

849
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:44,880
You can bet on it. Yeah, it's like, you know, it's it works, right? There's nothing that makes it not work

850
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:53,040
Um, even if it's creating bad laws or like, uh, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. It's like there's like a just world theory here

851
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,720
That's basically telling you that like when harvard starts

852
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:04,400
Teaching nonsense people will stop when we go to harvard and or people will stop listening to harvard or they will be like

853
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:11,280
No, it doesn't really work that way. Um, it's like when harvard ends. It's because basically

854
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:18,720
Somebody upstages it with another thing or it just collapses loses all this or or somebody infiltrates it

855
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,400
or the or or the police, um,

856
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,960
simply lock the doors and

857
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,440
Declare that, um

858
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:32,720
The campus has been seized of the trademark. It's been seized. I think it down has been seized

859
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:39,200
Right, you know, and and and so and and so the the thing is that basically and that's the that's the yeah, right

860
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:43,120
And and so the thing is that that when you basically

861
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,760
You know are sort of expecting

862
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,240
these things to happen

863
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:49,440
in

864
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:55,520
An automatic way and you basically are like well, this is an outrage but like

865
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:00,880
God is just and god will fix it in some way and therefore I don't have to

866
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:06,560
Um, or power doesn't have to know like actually only power can revise power

867
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,840
If you look for example at like germany in 1945

868
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,560
Let's take germany in 1945

869
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,240
The occupying regime

870
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,960
american military government, um

871
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:24,960
Mg I've got the acronym has the same powers as hitler right not only can they

872
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:30,800
You know, they can destroy anything that hitler created. They're not like oh, well the ss is losing its prestige

873
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:35,760
He wants to join the ss and you know anymore now in 1946 like no, that's not how it worked

874
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:40,480
You know when east germany was shut down it wasn't like the stasi is losing its prestige

875
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,960
Right, it was like no actually

876
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,080
There is a new power over this and the new power

877
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:49,600
Has the power to just force this to cease to exist

878
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,240
and it will cease to exist and

879
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:58,080
So like if you look at the denazification of germany and the sort of level of

880
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:01,280
There are two things that stand out about that one is

881
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:08,720
The level of force required to denazify germany and the level of violence required to denazify germany

882
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,120
the level of violence after

883
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:18,720
Conquering germany, which took quite a bit of violence the level of violence needed to enforce that was almost zero

884
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:22,000
There was a huge fear, you know of basically

885
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:26,560
You know the occupying forces are coming into occupied germany. They're like this is the most

886
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,000
Propagandized nationalist population in history

887
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,240
Hitler has been filling their heads full of pure crazy for 13 years

888
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:38,720
Like clearly what's going to happen is they're going to start like these like guerrilla movements

889
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,880
They're going to go all like werewolf. There's going to be ied's like there's going to be

890
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:47,200
None of that happened. Yeah, almost none of it same thing in japan

891
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:51,760
Incredibly fanatical population drilled with all this propaganda

892
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:56,000
You take absolute power over them and they're like quiet as lambs

893
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:03,120
And their minds change, but that didn't happen in afghanistan and something about no that didn't happen in afghanistan

894
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,800
that didn't have happened in afghanistan because basically

895
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:08,720
the

896
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,040
When you look at the way in which

897
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:18,640
Like or like the specific directives like jcs 1067 is the directive for occupying germany

898
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:24,400
You read this and it's basically a document of imperialism and it includes things like

899
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:29,120
Americans are not allowed to fraternize with germans. They're not allowed to make friends with germans

900
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:33,360
We have to understand get them to understand that this is a conquered country

901
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:39,600
You know whereas in afghanistan, it's like we didn't conquer you would conquer we didn't conquer afghanistan

902
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,800
We liberated afghanistan. We're here to advise you

903
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,720
And so we're not in command. We're not telling you what to do

904
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:51,520
So we kind of basically just pass it aggressively want you to do what we say

905
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,960
And yeah, and we're going to give you more money if you do what we say, but we're not in command here

906
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:02,720
That's imperialism. My god. We would never do that. That's bad. That would cause instant, you know revolutions

907
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:07,120
Like absolutely terrible, right and the thing is so basically

908
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,360
You know

909
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:14,400
It's only that absolute is the total conquering attitude that actually affects change

910
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:20,960
There's a there's a there's a an analogy that the victorians used to use which is grasping the nettle

911
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:27,920
A nettle is a plant you'll find it in the pacific northwest a lot and in england with stinging hairs on it

912
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:33,760
And supposedly if you touch a nettle, I have done this and it's very painful if you touch a nettle it will hurt

913
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:38,720
But if you grasp it firmly it will like compress the hairs so that they don't sting

914
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:44,080
And basically the lesson of grasping the nettle, which is something also very relevant in parenting

915
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:49,920
you know weak parents are the ones who yell at their kids and the

916
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:57,200
The the the sense you're not a parent. Are you um, you know, but I'd work with kids for

917
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:03,120
A few decades now the the but I was just thinking about like the like showing up to school. This is this is why you're uh

918
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:09,680
constitutionally opposed to showing up to school board meetings or making these little laws against wokeness here and there

919
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:15,360
Yeah, yeah, that's just you're just touching the nettle. You're not actually you're just touching the nettle

920
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:22,480
You're not actually grasping the nettle and so you'll basically see you know in any situation with kids like

921
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:27,280
The nice substitute teacher is in a room that is a war zone

922
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,680
Whereas the extremely strict teacher never raises her voice

923
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:38,080
right and and the the like the the sense of that and that's just a

924
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:45,680
Basic principle of like governance and management which again of power which again is completely lost here and so basically

925
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:51,760
um, you know the occupiers in 45 came in with this extremely

926
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:58,000
Determined attitude which actually in Germany was quite rough in japan. It was not rough

927
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
But in in Germany they were quite rough

928
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:05,760
But we were more lenient to japan than to germany. Yes because it was being run by macarthur specifically

929
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:06,400
um

930
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,280
And macarthur was kind of an old asia hand who kind of you know

931
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:15,520
Had a sense of what to do whereas there were a lot of like ideological fanatics in the the government of the new germany

932
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,040
You may have heard of the like morgan fowl plan or stuff like that

933
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,400
um, but yeah, it was like it was like it was

934
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:28,160
There were things like intentional starvation policies and shit, which nobody talks about. Um, yeah

935
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,680
and um

936
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:37,760
No, I could I could see like psychologically because we're closer related to germans that we would really want to kind of

937
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,400
Beat it out of them. The ideology

938
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:48,160
Of the time you can go. I always recommend this to people go on the internet. There's a little movie from 1945

939
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,080
This is the seuss one

940
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:53,600
The yeah, the seuss one hitler lives hitler lives. It's absolutely worth seeing

941
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,400
and um

942
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:03,200
And and just don't like worry about the fact that you're typing the word hitler lives into a google search box

943
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,840
It's a historical documentary. It's very anti-nazi

944
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:11,360
to say the least um, and and your mind will be blown and the um

945
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,480
But yeah, you know, so

946
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,960
I think a better example in some ways is the deconstruction of east germany

947
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:27,280
Because again, it's like when in 89 99 right, you know, because when you have a real regime change in a country

948
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,760
Everyone's life changes

949
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:34,880
Like there's no like everyone's life changes. Every institution is different

950
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:40,480
Anything that remains is reconstructed. Most things do not remain

951
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,400
and

952
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:48,160
There's no like there's no sense that like the stasi was going to be turned into like a you know

953
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:54,560
Something different in 1989 or the ss was going to be turned into something different in 1945

954
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:59,440
That's not the way it works. And so the thing is that if you basically

955
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:03,520
Are really talking about a change of regime

956
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:06,160
You're talking about basically

957
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:13,520
Taking all of these powerful institutions inside or outside the government and basically

958
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:20,800
Deconstructing them and your experience just across the board by fiat across the board by fiat and you know

959
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:27,200
The experience of being because you're basically saying you're declaring that these were unofficial parts of the government

960
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:32,400
And then you're reorganizing that part of the government. Yeah, and and you know the experience of being

961
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:39,920
In one of these institutions or part of this sort of ruling class like that should not

962
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:42,720
Be a like

963
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:49,520
Painful experience. It is a little painful when basically, you know, you're a major in the stasi

964
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:55,920
You put your whole career into this like whatever you've served faithfully serve the german democratic republic

965
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,960
And like one day you're like, I know there were problems

966
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:03,840
It wasn't perfect like but you know like what what are you going to do? And then one day one day one day

967
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,840
It's all over right, you know

968
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:11,600
And the your ideology the day before it's all over is just like

969
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,960
We are the guardians of the revolution

970
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:20,320
You know if like western imperialists subjugate our country. We are

971
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:28,320
Professional revolutionaries. We will conspire in the cafes. We will plant our bombs. We will be just like linen and Stalin

972
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:33,920
And then you realize you're not like linen and Stalin the day after you're like, oh, I was just a bureaucrat

973
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,320
Guess what happens to you as a bureaucrat?

974
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,000
You get a pension

975
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Okay, you're retired, you know, there's

976
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,800
Are you saying that we have to pay off all the gender studies?

977
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:50,480
Professors all of them all the critical theorists. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely because the thing is that basically

978
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:54,080
that is absolutely because that

979
01:14:54,320 --> 01:15:00,320
Is the only way to respect what they were actually doing what they were actually doing

980
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:05,440
Was not wrong because they were faithfully serving the old regime

981
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:12,560
They were okay. Maybe if they did something especially evil like that could be looked at but it's like

982
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,200
the principle that

983
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,600
this is why like

984
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Germany today still pays pensions

985
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:23,680
I believe not only to stasi officers even to some vermarked officers

986
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:27,760
Right because basically what you're saying is that

987
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,400
If you say to these people

988
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,440
You're an alien force. You're not part of society

989
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,640
Like you're saying

990
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:41,040
We don't really own you we don't really care about you

991
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:47,840
You're an outcast you should go and plot your next revolution because that's the only way you'll have a future

992
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:51,280
Whereas if you're saying to them, yeah, you know what it's like

993
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:59,040
Yeah, you were a professor of marxist linenist literature at the moscow university in 1987 like what is your future?

994
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,600
I don't know was it bad

995
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:07,440
Read a book read a novel like was it bad to study marxist linenist literature like yeah, okay?

996
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:13,920
You know you read literature. It's fine. You're smart. You can teach school, you know, like, you know the there's like

997
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,320
the sense of

998
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,320
sort of responsible

999
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:22,080
Leadership is very much the sense of like

1000
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,760
If you have never dehumanize

1001
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:30,880
Never be human if you have a regime that feels that it represents

1002
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,520
Only a part of the country

1003
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
That's like very bad

1004
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,880
and so the sense of basically

1005
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:43,760
any kind of monarchy any kind of new regime of any form

1006
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,160
in

1007
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:52,320
This country like one of the things that is going to be kind of its best biggest selling point

1008
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:55,360
Is that it's ending the kind of cold civil war?

1009
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:58,160
And so the sense of basically

1010
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:02,720
You know, what are you if you were like a critical theorist english professor like

1011
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,920
Okay, you were someone who's

1012
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,840
Entire world basically just a preacher

1013
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:16,000
With yeah, if you're someone whose entire world was consumed by the ideology of the old regime

1014
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:17,760
um

1015
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:20,240
The old regime has turned to dust and fallen away

1016
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:26,080
And like you can't go on doing that like there's no world in which people are going to pay you to do that

1017
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:27,440
but

1018
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,440
That doesn't make you a bad person

1019
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:34,400
That doesn't make it just means that you had a bullshit job under the old regime. Guess what?

1020
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,520
A lot of people had bullshit jobs under the old regime

1021
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:43,360
Right because like a lot of bullshit was done, right? And so the sense of basically

1022
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,880
It's over and like everyone should be fine with that

1023
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:53,440
It's over and that's fine rather than it's over and like

1024
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,520
Now begins the vengeance, right? You know, it's just like

1025
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:02,560
So why why do you think that when biden first came in he's like i'm the we're the party of unity

1026
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:04,800
We're going to unify the country and at this point in time

1027
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:10,560
He's now more or less actively like saying ultramaga. He's like doing this weird kind of rhetoric

1028
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:15,280
It seems kind of impotent, but it's still kind of dangerous where he's other half of the country

1029
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:20,720
Why would he do that? Like if that's not to support because he's you know, leaning on

1030
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:25,040
The half that supports him and he is like, um

1031
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:33,840
So he's caught in the trap of his unity. His unity is fundamentally hegemonic in in form and it can't basically

1032
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:38,240
This sense of like I own my base, but I own your base too

1033
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,200
Is the kind of unity that's like

1034
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:44,160
You know, that's a dominant

1035
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:48,640
like and of course dominating basically the flyover people and basically

1036
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:51,360
sort of, um

1037
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,840
You know

1038
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:59,040
Yeah, keeping them keeping this outcast or deplorables or keeping basically

1039
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:05,680
Like them in this sort of frame of mind where they're like you should be good enough to vote for me, you know, um

1040
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:10,720
In in sort of this like keeping the kind of structure between the aristocracy

1041
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:17,120
sort of blue state aristocracy and the red state bourgeoisie is is like, you know, you

1042
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:20,720
should aspire to be one of us and if you don't maybe your children will

1043
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:22,640
and

1044
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:28,400
It's not like that does not represent like there's sort of no actually like

1045
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:33,680
Oh, I care about red state people and I want them to be able to live their lives in like a red state way

1046
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:38,080
No, do you think that there's something in the system that's causing him to not be able to do that?

1047
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:42,560
Like if you wanted to be the the unifying president and at this point it's fallen apart

1048
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:43,440
I mean

1049
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:49,680
Whether regardless if it's him or not who's making these decisions and writing these talking points like if that was what they wanted to do

1050
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:51,920
What's keeping them from unifying?

1051
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,880
Well, you'd have to actually out trumping trump

1052
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:58,960
You know, you you'd because you lose your own

1053
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:02,880
base essentially, it's like you have to give

1054
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:06,400
If you're gonna like basically say

1055
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,200
I mean

1056
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:12,160
One of the things that you see sort of american

1057
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:16,640
Leftism or many leftisms do is they sort of

1058
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:19,440
Circulate their clients

1059
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:25,840
And so there's always this sort of client population, you know, where a hundred years ago. It's the working class

1060
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,160
It's the factory worker, right?

1061
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,720
And the thing is that at a certain point

1062
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:36,640
The factory worker is no longer an asset and what we really need is basically

1063
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:40,160
Instead of a class war we needed a race and culture war

1064
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:46,960
Or we're like our asset is like black americans. No way. We actually prefer mexicans

1065
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:54,000
Um, they're more of them now and so like we're gonna let the mexicans take the blacks jobs

1066
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:58,400
Right or whatever right, you know and and this sense of

1067
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:00,800
and like

1068
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:04,480
The working class like stuck with these people for

1069
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,200
A very long time you have the union

1070
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,560
Midwest union people right who basically

1071
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:16,720
Have been sort of voting democratic or we're voting democratic on autopilot for 50 or 60 years

1072
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,160
Until they realized that they were actually no longer

1073
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:26,720
The like mascot. They were now the goat. Um, if you look at the populations that

1074
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,200
Who voted for f dr?

1075
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:32,080
Well, who voted for f dr was a thin, you know

1076
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:35,520
cream of aristocrats like him and then

1077
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,800
The solid south

1078
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:43,280
Though, you know old democratic segregationist regimes who were

1079
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:49,360
Democrats because robert lee was a democrat and i've always voted democrat and i'm robert lee was a good man

1080
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,240
You know and then the inner city catholics

1081
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:58,880
Right and the inner city catholics and slavs who you're like what because they don't exist anymore

1082
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:01,680
They all got but what was their attraction like?

1083
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,560
um, again

1084
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:12,320
Traditional ethnic traditional ethnic power politics, right and so those were ethnic machines and those machines were basically

1085
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,880
had always been

1086
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:18,720
You know the democrats where america's sort of conservative party in a way

1087
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:23,280
But they were also the party of like the catholics and the inner city

1088
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,680
Like old, you know camity hall

1089
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:29,680
And like the old sort of these old style political machines

1090
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:33,520
And these old style political machines basically like

1091
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:37,920
You know when the solid south puts f dr into power

1092
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:42,560
They're setting into motion the forces that would destroy the solid south

1093
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:48,000
They have no idea they don't think of themselves when they vote for democrats is voting for liberals

1094
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:51,200
They think of themselves as voting for robert lee, right?

1095
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,840
And so they were the same thing with the union democrats

1096
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:59,840
Yeah, they kept on voting for robert lee up until like the 1960s when they're like wait a second

1097
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:02,880
Like this is no longer the party of robert lee, right?

1098
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:06,720
And so it's sort of easy when you have a client base

1099
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,280
That trusts you like that

1100
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:14,720
Those are the people that are going to get abused because when you can take someone for granted

1101
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:16,800
you know

1102
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:21,360
That's who you abuse and and so you know like the sense of

1103
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:29,360
You know, there's clearly in sort of voting in the new deal which would eventually bring them the civil rights movement

1104
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:33,520
There's a sense in which you know, the mark cistern false consciousness

1105
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:38,480
Is applicable to all of these segregationists who were voting for f dr

1106
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:45,200
They sort of knew he wasn't really a segregationist, but you know, like robert lee was a democrat, right? And so

1107
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:50,320
When you look at the various like sort of solid

1108
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:55,200
Blocks in um india to have this wonderful term which is vote bank

1109
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:59,200
Which is like a group of like ethnic votes that a politician can count on

1110
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:04,240
So, you know, when you look at basically like the like democratic vote bank or whatever

1111
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:07,040
um, you're basically seeing

1112
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:16,240
Yeah, I mean like certainly like so with biden is there's something about the uh his base his vote bank that needs that

1113
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:18,640
antagonism with this other

1114
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:24,640
Vote bank that he's locked into this party policy. Yeah, he's he's called civil war as you call it. Yes. Yes

1115
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:29,520
I mean blue state america is deeply locked into this cold cold civil war because there's really

1116
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,640
Not much they can say anymore

1117
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:40,400
To get, you know, the white working class or whatever. Yeah, right, you know, and and there's but there's still like there's a lot of

1118
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:45,920
Aspirational support out there. There's a lot of people who sort of look up to the upper class

1119
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:49,280
There's a lot of people like there's a lot of that, you know

1120
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:54,800
Even that like, you know, I mean this is where biden came from in the 70s

1121
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,440
He's going around Delaware, which is after all a southern state

1122
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:03,520
Basically telling everyone, you know, what a bad idea busing and desegregation are I mean, he's lived that long, right?

1123
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:07,920
You know, and so in the 90s he's talking about super predators, you know

1124
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:11,920
Like I mean, this is a very empty hollow man

1125
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:16,080
Which is just sort of the voice of the power around him. Yeah, exactly

1126
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:21,680
So he's a great. He's a great image of what we're actually dealing with in a while. Yeah, yeah, right, right, right?

1127
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:27,200
I like I mean, I let's let's elect him again in 2024 as he gets older and older

1128
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:34,160
Um, I think it would be beautiful and and the uh, he might actually just start drooling in front of his teleprompter

1129
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:38,320
the autumn of the page if he hasn't done that already, you know, and um

1130
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,720
Yeah, so so so like when you

1131
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:45,440
you know

1132
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:50,400
You sort of imagine, you know monarchy this like exotic system of government, which is, you know

1133
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:55,840
The system of government that like 99 of all people in history have lived under

1134
01:25:56,320 --> 01:26:00,800
And then you're like, but it could be insane and do weird insane things and I'm like

1135
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:05,440
Actually, there's a lot of insanity there right now. You're just used to it

1136
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:11,680
Well, especially if if you I think there might be three kind of state you said there's a wartime and then the peacetime kind of

1137
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:12,960
uh

1138
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:19,680
Executive but there could be like a cleanup executive and then kind of a prosperous executive and then a stabilizing executive like there's kind of

1139
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,960
Yeah, the cleanup executive is definitely like the wartime

1140
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:30,320
executive essentially and just being able to explicitly call out power and and to regulate power through one

1141
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,280
explicit means rather than having going through this

1142
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,840
oligarchical

1143
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:41,280
Institutional process that gets all these weird ideas in it that it can't shake down if you have like one

1144
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,840
free agent that

1145
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:45,040
all

1146
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,040
Through which all power flows

1147
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:53,280
And the potential to clean up and then to also make decisions or at least to make decisions cleanly that can then be

1148
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:55,680
held account

1149
01:26:55,680 --> 01:27:01,040
One way or another rather than it being lost in all these processes right is much

1150
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:07,200
Yeah, yeah, it's much more. It's much more. I mean, and it's just like you look at I constantly say this

1151
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:11,360
But like if you look at anything that gets done in the real world today, it's done by a monarchy

1152
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:15,200
Drive a car is made by a monarchy, you know that microphone in front of you

1153
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:20,080
It was made by a monarchy, which is a company in China, which is another monarchy

1154
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:22,800
So like the set of like if you look around you

1155
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:29,440
You see a world made by monarchies within monarchies and and like the

1156
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:36,080
If there was an effective oligarchical or republican way to run a company

1157
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:40,640
somebody would have that worked better than that somebody certainly would have found it

1158
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:42,160
and

1159
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:48,000
Because there's nothing stopping you from having a company that's run by a congress and a judiciary and a president and all that right?

1160
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:50,640
and um

1161
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,640
But but that's a way to run a railroad

1162
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:58,320
But in order for us to make that leap there has to be a huge change of view by the american

1163
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:02,960
Populus towards power and and one thing is to expose it like you're doing

1164
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:08,160
But it's another to like try to get people on the same page because everybody that I tell your ideas to recoils

1165
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:13,600
I'm living in washington and portland. So, you know, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course a washington state

1166
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:18,320
Yeah, right and and and and and so and and they recoil

1167
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,960
in a way

1168
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:26,960
They recoil for a couple of different reasons. They recoil at a sense of alieness and they also feel

1169
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:28,880
um

1170
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,880
subconsciously that

1171
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:35,200
A source of meaning in their lives would be taken away

1172
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:37,120
and

1173
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,120
The sense of having power

1174
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:44,640
For them is not about having a government that treats them. Well, it's about

1175
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:49,360
mattering in a sense and this idea that they would no longer matter

1176
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:52,000
in that way

1177
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:58,080
Feels emasculating it feels like basically people have a natural power drive

1178
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,800
and that sort of power drive is kind of

1179
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:08,240
Being exploited in them to give this them this illusion of mattering. Whereas it's actually sort of turns into

1180
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,000
support

1181
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,600
it's like basically

1182
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,600
Your desire to matter

1183
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:20,160
This guy, um, this great political scientist Guy Tana Mosca from over 100 years ago had this great term

1184
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:22,240
Which is a political formula

1185
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:26,640
And a political formula is whatever you believe that causes you to support the government

1186
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:32,720
So you might be in ancient egypt and you might believe that pharaoh should be on the throne because pharaoh is the son of

1187
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:38,720
You know the great grandson of god or something and yeah myth and basically if pharaoh is not on the throne

1188
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:43,840
Then the sun will not come up in the morning, right? And that's a political formula

1189
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:49,200
And you know 20th century political formulas tend to resolve around

1190
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:52,560
I feel powerful because I support the government

1191
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:57,120
Or you think or are you right or you know all of these

1192
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:02,320
Yeah, all of these things giving you a sense of meaning and importance

1193
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:07,120
And the thing is you're sort of trading what you don't realize is that you're trading

1194
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
That in order for this basically

1195
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:15,840
pornographic feeling of meaning and importance which is pornographic because it's not real

1196
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:20,160
You're not actually in the decision loop when you look at Ukraine

1197
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:26,000
You're not actually like moving ukraine and you know armies around on the battlefield like a chess board

1198
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:31,760
You're just having this kind of pornographic feeling of feeling like you are defending ukraine

1199
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:36,960
Just like when you view pornography, you're like i'm i'm doing it with this girl, but you're not

1200
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,440
you know and and so

1201
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,080
what that basically

1202
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:45,200
That sort of change of

1203
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:47,760
That myth

1204
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:53,840
That change yeah that myth that formula and what rejecting that formula sort of allows you to do

1205
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,480
is basically to change

1206
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,040
exchange this

1207
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:03,200
To set aside this delusional sense of power and importance

1208
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:06,320
And replace it with something that actually matters

1209
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:13,280
You can become if you basically can conquer your emotional desire for importance

1210
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:18,560
Then she called it like political nofap at some point. Yeah. Yeah. It's like political nofap or it's like, you know

1211
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:23,200
The thing that I always uh, you know the example that I always use I don't think this actually works in real life

1212
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:28,080
But um, there's this um legendary monkey banana trap where you basically

1213
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:33,280
Have a banana and you and it's inside a little enclosure and the monkey puts its hand in the box

1214
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:38,000
And then cannot get its hand out of the box without letting go with a banana

1215
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:43,200
And so and then the hunter comes along and cracks it on the head and eats fried monkey for dinner, right?

1216
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:45,120
and and like

1217
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:52,400
And you're like there are a lot of bananas outside the box, but you have to be able to let go of the banana

1218
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:58,160
And the sort of the problem of letting go of the banana if you look at

1219
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:03,440
The capacity here is why I'm optimistic about the ability

1220
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:05,920
For people to solve this problem

1221
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:14,080
Which they clearly haven't been able to do in the past. I'm optimistic about it because first of all when you compare

1222
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:18,960
Americans today and the way they interact with politics

1223
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:24,720
To the way they interacted a hundred years ago. They're much more apathetic

1224
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:30,880
They're sort of much less like they're much less ready ready. For example to engage in political violence

1225
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:34,720
Um, they're much to show up to seven hour zoom meetings

1226
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:40,640
Seven hour, you know, or seven hour like riots, right? You know, like you can't you know

1227
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:45,120
like like the um, but the race riots in 2020

1228
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:52,400
Yeah, but the thing is the last time you see like white people rioting is like the 40s for example

1229
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:59,520
um, or you know, even like january 6 is like this incredibly pathetic thing like it's not

1230
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:04,960
It's pretty well, I don't know according to the democrats like it's a national holiday now

1231
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:11,040
They have the ceremonies and stuff about it. It's pretty powerful. It's pretty it's pretty limp, uh, you know and and like

1232
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:13,280
Yeah, I'll show you right, you know

1233
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:19,680
You want to see you want you want to see a riot, you know, um the um, um

1234
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:26,960
It's it's it's pretty limp and but but but we're we're expending that in a pornographic way on twitter by

1235
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:31,600
Doing all this culture. We're you're saying is this culture where stuff is just pornographic

1236
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:38,720
It's a pornographic experience release and you know the thing that can compete with pornography is sex

1237
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,720
It's like basically

1238
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:44,480
Whenever you sort of show people how to have actual sex

1239
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,400
um, you know

1240
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:49,600
That is the one way to pull them away from their porn and so

1241
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,400
The thing is I'm like no

1242
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:57,200
What you're doing cannot result in any real political change, but actually

1243
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:03,280
Real things can happen and here's how and that's sort of exciting even

1244
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,920
If it doesn't have

1245
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:10,720
That's exciting at a different level and in a different sense because you're like, okay

1246
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:14,480
They're not close to happening. It's not about to happen

1247
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:20,320
And what all this sort of pornographic politics is offering me is the sense that like this is about to happen

1248
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:25,440
Well, like elect trump and like amazing things will happen and you know, or like we'll let you know

1249
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:29,600
And and I'm like no none of this nothing will happen as a result of these elections

1250
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:34,160
But the thing is if you want to think in a way that would

1251
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:38,560
Lead if you can get other people to think in this way

1252
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:41,200
Real things to happen

1253
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:43,840
There's something actually more exciting about that

1254
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:48,240
And it's exciting in a like subtle and ironic way

1255
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:53,520
The idea that the way to have real power is like give up your power

1256
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:56,160
Has this ironic quality to it

1257
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:59,440
And the thing is that we are living

1258
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:03,440
We have the most ironic population history

1259
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:09,840
There's never been any period in history when like irony was his mass market

1260
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:15,360
The memes are a flowing my friend never anywhere close and so basically

1261
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:20,560
How is irony a political force like I've heard you bring this up, but what is it about it?

1262
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:24,640
It's a political force because it basically allows you to like say like

1263
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:30,640
Fuck it in a really interesting way. There's the none of the apocetic like you know that no

1264
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:33,600
Not in did you know the british show black mirror?

1265
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:39,920
Oh, yeah, yeah, if there's a there's a black mirror episode I always point people to where

1266
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:44,640
The population elects a cartoon character

1267
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:48,960
As a joke or is it like comment or is this something right?

1268
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:53,440
Yeah, you know and it's like or if you look at something like sort of storm area 51

1269
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:59,520
That didn't come off area 51 wasn't stormed. Oh, yeah, but it kind of gives you a sense of like

1270
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:02,000
that

1271
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,080
The sense of

1272
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:08,880
Like there will be whenever this thing comes crashing down

1273
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:12,800
There will be like a ludic a playful sense to it

1274
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:16,320
Much as there was like especially like shekels of akia

1275
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:19,920
In 89 with like the the velvet revolution

1276
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:27,280
You know, um, you had this real sense of playfulness to it like an important aspect the venture of the velvet

1277
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:29,760
revolution was this like

1278
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:35,600
Sort of a banned plastic people of the universe. It was kind of velvet underground influence

1279
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:41,040
Like, you know, and so you had a revostov hovel who's just like ironic playwright becomes the you know

1280
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:44,480
It was from being a dissident to the president in Czechoslovakia

1281
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:46,480
Um

1282
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:51,600
We saw the little bit of that in the trucker uh convoy in canada. There was a communal thing

1283
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:58,480
But the weird thing about that was that that's where truto like showed the power of the state to people of their finances

1284
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:01,200
Which is really scary and people took it like

1285
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:04,080
Yeah, and people took it like way too

1286
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,800
Like seriously in a way

1287
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:14,160
And his his his move to no the banks. No the truckers the truckers took themselves way too seriously

1288
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:19,520
I'm sort of not seriously enough like they didn't like like like there was yeah

1289
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:25,520
I mean, they were they were kind of larping in the end. They weren't like it wasn't it sounds like you're you're advocating for larping

1290
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:30,640
But there's like some sort of truth sincerity this room. Yeah, there's there's like there's like

1291
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:35,360
You sort of do it as a lark, but it becomes real. It's like a basically

1292
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:40,240
The sense of being a sort of a joke that makes itself real

1293
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,880
I think will be kind of part

1294
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:49,600
Of this thing. That sounds kind of like apocalyptic or revelatory. Well, it's in a way. I mean, I mean

1295
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:54,080
We talked about Ukraine Ukraine elected a comedian as president, right?

1296
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:58,480
You know and so there's this sense of like

1297
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:04,960
It will feel sort of almost accidental. It won't have this sort of like

1298
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,720
Patriots rise up to like, you know

1299
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:11,680
feeling it won't it will be like

1300
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:15,440
We can't take this seriously like a carnival, right?

1301
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:18,640
Yeah, it will have it. It will have a very joyous

1302
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:25,200
Feel and not a very like a carnival. It will feel very joyous and it will not feel like

1303
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:29,760
And it will feel sort of that image irreversible

1304
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:34,560
coupled with the outcome of like somebody with absolute power completely just

1305
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:38,640
Liquidating all the institutions and rebooting them, which is like the most serious thing

1306
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:42,560
I mean, it's comedic like like I read I've been reading your sub-stack

1307
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:46,240
We get to the part like well, how are we going to change things and it's so out

1308
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:50,800
It's just so absurd. It's like we're just going to tear everything apart. We're going to take complete authority

1309
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:57,920
It's like what he can't do that. Yeah, and it breaks my brain every time I right and and and and that the sense of basically like

1310
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:05,440
Voting for that or voting to be like, you know, it's like, you know, one of the ways I sort of picture it is as I'm like

1311
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:08,160
imagine you're in

1312
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:13,120
Like the little room with the astronaut at like the end of 2001, right?

1313
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:17,760
And you're just in this like weird space and like there's like playing food all right Dave, right?

1314
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:22,640
You know, I'm sorry Dave. I can't do that, you know and and like but there's one difference

1315
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:27,440
There's a red button on the wall and under the red button. It says if you press this button

1316
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:30,480
everything will change

1317
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:31,840
well

1318
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:36,320
serious sober like a hard-working respectable people

1319
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:41,280
Are not going to grown-ups are not going to press that button because they're like

1320
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:44,160
We could just be shot into out into space. That would be a change

1321
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:47,680
but you know who presses the button is basically

1322
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:52,880
immature people childlike people like people who are

1323
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,040
have

1324
01:39:55,040 --> 01:40:00,160
a sense of fun which is much bigger than their sense of seriousness and so, you know

1325
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:08,640
The people of america today are not minute men. They are not like the like paul revere is not in the building

1326
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:12,320
Like they do not act out of like a deep sense of

1327
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:19,760
Have you seen every couple months? Like there's this really stupid group of like supposed white supremacist, but it's totally an fbi sting

1328
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:24,080
It's like there's just footage of them. Do you know what i'm talking about? Like they're the people's army or something

1329
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:31,520
Yeah, and everybody's laughing at them. Nobody believes that that actually is serious right and and and and so the sense of like

1330
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:34,000
you know

1331
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
that sense of

1332
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:38,800
Like really

1333
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:44,160
Deep comedy and irony like that's so ironic that it's real

1334
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:49,520
Is like really crucial to that sort of spirit

1335
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:53,920
So how did you get this idea of any possible regime change? How did you come to this?

1336
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,360
conception um

1337
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:02,240
I think that it's sort of part of

1338
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:12,240
Kind of being brought up in the american upper class and kind of understanding

1339
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:15,200
it's like spirit

1340
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:17,360
in a way

1341
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:18,240
and

1342
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:20,240
it's like when you

1343
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:24,880
A good way to sort of track the spirit is in popular entertainment

1344
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:31,120
It's like imagine if you took a film like inception and you put it in movie theater in 1962

1345
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:36,640
Like people would be like coming out of their theater just like grabbing their heads like stunned monkeys, right?

1346
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:40,800
You know even in like 1992 that would be like a cult film

1347
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:45,040
But like 20 years after that it's like a blockbuster and people are like

1348
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:49,040
Oh, yeah, there's three levels reality and I fall back into the bathtub every the next month, right?

1349
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:52,800
You know and it's like their ability to sort of switch frames

1350
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,000
Yeah

1351
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:59,040
Is like really really great and it's sort of much easier to just like

1352
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:02,960
They're sort of their attachment when you're in this sort of ironic

1353
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:08,240
Sophisticated state of mind. You're like attachment to the prison frame

1354
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:10,960
Is just not that great

1355
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,120
and so

1356
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:20,800
To like move you sort of along the ground is still like hard. It's hard to reason people into something

1357
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:23,920
but like when you're just like no

1358
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:30,000
Throw away everything about the way you see the world and like change to see it in this other way

1359
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:32,960
There's a lot of people who are just like, okay

1360
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:36,880
Sure, right and and that comes out of a kind of frivolousness

1361
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:41,280
That comes out of a like lack of virtue in a sense

1362
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:46,080
But like politics is the art of the possible and the thing is if you're looking for basically

1363
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:49,360
a politics of virtue

1364
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:52,960
to like unite a fundamentally

1365
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:56,240
Unsterious and unvirtuous population

1366
01:42:56,400 --> 01:43:00,960
But there's still perfor larping like this bloodbath this civil war on twitter, right?

1367
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:04,560
Yeah, right, right and and it's just like and it's just like you can do

1368
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:06,560
like

1369
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:13,120
And you know the feeling of sort of popping people out of that is very refreshing and like the whole sort of

1370
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:18,240
framework of the debate the cold civil war the like issues or whatever

1371
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:22,080
Very tiresome very uninteresting very unchewy

1372
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:24,640
Your ability to get ahead

1373
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:28,880
left-wing politics was sort of designed to get people ahead

1374
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:34,400
Or it's like works sort of like like up up the classes. Is that we mean like yeah or up

1375
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:38,720
You know up the like rise and like have a career and a profession

1376
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:42,720
You know, it's like one of the ways that I described like the early new deal

1377
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:46,080
Is that it really was like a start-up Washington in a lot of ways

1378
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:50,800
And like you're like life cycle of being in the new deal had this like start-up quality

1379
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:57,120
Like you would graduate from say Harvard with a degree in this new science of economics in like 1935

1380
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:03,280
And you know somebody who knows somebody who knows like Felix Frankfurter or Tommy Corcoran or something

1381
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:09,520
And so you're like make some inquiries and one day you get a call and the voice on the telephone

1382
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:13,040
it's like would you like to come to Washington and

1383
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:19,360
You know work for us and you're like what what would I be doing and the voice will be like we'll figure it out

1384
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:26,240
You know and you get there and you get in an office and your boss is like here's three million dollars go electrify arkansas

1385
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:31,280
Right, you know and that same person like 80 years later like their existence is

1386
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:35,600
They're basically a tracy flick, you know the the great film election

1387
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:37,040
um

1388
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:40,160
Alexander pain film from like 25 years ago or so

1389
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:42,800
Reese Witherspoon

1390
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:44,560
High school student government, right?

1391
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:49,440
You know, so you're like tracy flick and your goal is to get ahead in everything and be like a goody-goody

1392
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,680
And you're on the high school newspaper and you go to Harvard and you know

1393
01:44:54,240 --> 01:44:56,240
study political science

1394
01:44:56,320 --> 01:45:02,080
And then you're like I want to go to Washington. Okay. I'm gonna like intern for like

1395
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:07,120
A house member doing like a constituent service and like, you know after a while

1396
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:12,960
They might let me talk to the lobbyists who writes the legislation and you'd be like see here's a line of legislation

1397
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:15,520
I took care of for that. It wouldn't say that if I hadn't been there

1398
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:21,440
You didn't write it you got it from the right lobbyist or activist or whatever, right, you know, and so basically

1399
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:24,400
This is a very saturated system

1400
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:31,280
In terms of its ability to offer the things to ambitious people that ambitious people

1401
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,520
They need a

1402
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:38,160
similar simulacra of power, but you don't actually do anything you don't get three million dollars to electrify

1403
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:45,600
Yeah, and if you actually do something it's because you work really hard to get a bunch of status

1404
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:49,920
And then after you got that status you've got some real actual power

1405
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:52,800
and

1406
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:56,480
You know, yeah, it's like a really um

1407
01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:02,160
It's like it's really grueling and it rewards like people who are not

1408
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:08,080
As imaginative and talented like people who are really imaginative talented want to it, right?

1409
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:16,560
And because it fucking sucks, you know, and and so you have like sort of all of these things are kind of

1410
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:23,040
ripe for something different in a way and like one way to think about

1411
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:27,920
Sort of the way that something different exists is to think about

1412
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:30,560
Or to sort of

1413
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:39,280
Define the different thing that you want to exist is to think about sort of how it should think about what we have at present

1414
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,840
How does the new regime think about the old regime?

1415
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:50,080
What does basically the soviet union in 1987 look like from the perspective of russia in 1997?

1416
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:55,280
How you look back on the old regime and it shouldn't be like oh man, I miss the old regime

1417
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:59,840
Wow, they could really get that shit done now our garbage doesn't get picked up. It should not be like that

1418
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:03,040
It should be the opposite of that, right? And so, you know

1419
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:05,840
if you're looking

1420
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:08,160
at like

1421
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:09,600
I mean

1422
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:10,960
sort of the old

1423
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:14,000
america from the perspective of an america where

1424
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:20,000
Even just basic things like you can walk safely anywhere any time of day or night, right?

1425
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:23,280
You know, think about how impossible it is would be to get that

1426
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:31,840
Basic simple feature of like the government monopoly on violence back, right? You know and and like speaking from the west coast

1427
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:33,680
I mean, we're kind of like

1428
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:39,200
Yeah, yeah experiencing class here. Portland. Did you say portland? Yeah, portland and seattle olympia

1429
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:43,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Sure. Sure. I've seen it all right

1430
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:49,120
And you're saying you're saying to get back to my first question the opportunity or the the

1431
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:56,400
The this regime is is selecting for madness on a number of different levels and then also selecting for people who have

1432
01:47:57,280 --> 01:48:01,760
Lot lack of talent or imagination because they would probably just want to be in a startup

1433
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:04,480
um to begin with

1434
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:06,720
So this new uh

1435
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:13,280
Era or new field will select for itself the leader that has the qualities that would maximize that

1436
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:18,800
Yeah, I mean, I think that really people underrate the extent to which

1437
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:24,880
sort of the structure determines the ideologies and the virtues and so

1438
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:27,760
basically

1439
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:29,920
any sort of

1440
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:31,920
monarchy at all would basically

1441
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:35,120
See that sort of bringing this like

1442
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:37,760
Sort of, you know, you know how hercules

1443
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:42,720
Sends the river into the audience tables, right? You know, uh, he he has

1444
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:48,160
You know in the myth of hercules. He has all these impossible tasks to do which he does in these impossible ways

1445
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:53,280
He's like i'm gonna clean out the dirtiest stables in the world. So like let's redirect river through it, right?

1446
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:55,760
you know and and sending

1447
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:57,840
like

1448
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:59,840
it's hard the sort of the

1449
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:02,400
course of like

1450
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:06,320
kind of healing and repair in that sense that

1451
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:11,520
Would be the obvious course for any monarch seems to me

1452
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:13,520
like

1453
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:17,920
If you took like j random ceo and made him king

1454
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:22,000
They'd probably are ceo of washington or you know

1455
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:30,320
Imperial president or whatever they'd probably mostly come out with the same kinds of things. I think it's definitely

1456
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:32,720
sort of like

1457
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:33,680
What is my role?

1458
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:37,120
My role is to sort of write the buck on how to do this, right?

1459
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:40,720
Which will I hope help it become more possible

1460
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:47,680
You courtesy arvin. That's your courtesy arvin. You know, my role is definitely not to be king of a possible pick of monarchy

1461
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:52,960
I'm a terrible. Sorry about that. I'm a terrible ceo. I've been a ceo. I'm awful at it. You really don't

1462
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:59,280
But i'm a more of a the priest type than the within the warrior type but

1463
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:06,080
But yeah, I mean like having that blueprint certainly helps or should help a great deal

1464
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:09,120
To make it possible. But yeah

1465
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,360
the political formulation

1466
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:13,520
the pre pre formulation

1467
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:16,640
Yeah, the you know the like why would you

1468
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:19,840
Yeah, the sort of the

1469
01:50:20,240 --> 01:50:24,240
You have to have something both that is a plan that could be followed

1470
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:26,960
and a plan that people can believe in

1471
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:29,200
and

1472
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:33,360
You know and that that belief is going to strike people is extremely on but like

1473
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:39,920
America is the land of propagandizing on beliefs and you know, imagine, you know, sure

1474
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:42,080
I mean imagine how like

1475
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:44,240
Imagine what people would have thought of punk

1476
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:51,360
In 1963 and now the brits are going to get mad because they're going to say they invented punk. Yeah. Well, the americans

1477
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:57,280
Maybe but I imagine what the brits would have thought of punk in 1963. All right. Well, I should probably

1478
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,440
We've been a while on on the last questions and yeah, well, no

1479
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:03,520
