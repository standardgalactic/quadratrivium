0	3440	So today with us is Wolfgang Smith.
3440	9280	He has majors in physics, mathematics, and philosophy.
9280	11320	He contributed a theoretical solution
11320	13680	to the reentry problem for spaceflight
13680	16000	during his work as an aerodynamicist.
16000	17520	He has a doctorate in mathematics
17520	19160	and pursued a career as a mathematician
19160	22320	until his retirement in 1992.
22320	24560	He devoted himself to the publication of books,
24560	26920	mission to correct the fallacies of contemporary
27880	30360	scientific belief, by the way, of insights derived
30360	32960	from the perennial wisdom of mankind.
32960	36440	These works focus primarily on foundational problems
36440	39600	in quantum theory and the problems of visual perception.
39600	42840	Welcome, Wolfgang.
42840	44000	Well, thank you.
44000	46120	Glad to be here.
46120	47720	Very, very glad you're here.
47720	49120	Very excited.
49120	51440	With us also today is Brian Murphy.
51440	54320	Now, Brian, could you please introduce yourself
54320	57200	while you're here?
57200	57720	Hi, Jack.
57720	59920	Thank you and hello to your audience.
59920	61600	I'll make my comments brief, and then
61600	63280	I'll turn it back to you and Wolfgang,
63280	66320	because that's really where the money is in this conversation.
66320	69920	And I came to know Wolfgang after seeing the documentary
69920	73320	about him called The End of Quantum Reality.
73320	75400	And after that, I ordered one of his books.
75400	77880	In that case, it was Science and Myth
77880	81320	with a response to Stephen Hawking's The Grand Design.
81320	83480	And after reading that book, I reached out
83480	85760	to the producer of the documentary on Facebook.
85760	88080	And I asked him if he had thought about creating
88080	91080	an educational initiative in the foundation.
91080	93400	And that led to a conversation and introduction
93400	96280	to Wolfgang and a friendship that has developed
96280	97520	over the past three years.
97520	100320	So we're now developing educational outreach
100320	102720	and hopefully a lecture series under the banner
102720	104240	of Project Scola.
104240	107600	And we have a number of prominent and highly skilled
107600	109840	and educated scholars from around the world who
109840	112680	are committed to this endeavor.
112680	114640	And so I have to say, when I read that book,
114640	116440	and I mean in the first chapter of that book,
116440	118840	the entire edifice of the worldview
118840	121600	that I had imbibed over the many years
121600	123680	just sort of melted into oblivion.
123680	126680	And I think we're all familiar with that worldview.
126680	129720	It's the one that purports to be scientific.
129720	132440	It generally comes from PhDs who tell us
132440	135760	we're sums of parts or composed of atoms or particles
135760	138720	speeding through space and time to no purpose.
138720	141600	And some might even say we have no free will
141720	143760	or that our actions and decisions
143760	146960	are determined in advance by these forces of physics.
146960	149560	And so, but I'm like one of your audience members.
149560	150440	I'm a lay person.
150440	151640	I don't have a PhD.
151640	153000	I'm not a physicist.
153000	154440	But I'm very interested in this topic
154440	157600	because I think it goes to the very heart of reality.
157600	160280	It goes to the very heart of what it means to be human.
160280	162160	And so in Wolfgang's latest book,
162160	164240	Physics, A Science and Quest of Ontology,
164240	166000	which you're gonna talk to him about,
166000	168800	Wolfgang really offers a new cosmology,
168800	170600	which is really an ancient cosmology.
170600	173960	And I think it'll really open people's eyes
173960	175600	to things they haven't heard before
175600	176880	or maybe haven't heard in decades.
176880	179520	So the bottom line is what I want your audience to know
179520	183160	is that Wolfgang Smith is not just another guy
183160	185720	with some interesting ideas among many.
185720	189640	No, I really feel there's no one like Wolfgang Smith.
189640	193520	And he has resolved the quantum reality problem,
193520	194880	the measurement problem.
194880	197840	And what he shows with amazing simplicity
197840	202240	is that our world is full of irreducible holes
202240	204560	of beings imbued with qualities
204560	206160	that transcend the world of physics.
206160	210120	And so like Plato's analogy of the cave,
210120	213200	he invites his readers and he invites listeners
213200	215320	to make that ascent out of the cave.
215320	218160	So I would invite you to listen to this man
218160	220400	and become a member of his foundation,
220400	221840	the Philosophia Initiative.
221840	224040	And with that, I'll turn it back to you too.
225040	225960	Thank you.
225960	227280	That was a great introduction.
227280	228760	Thank you.
228760	231240	Probably much better than I would have done.
231240	236400	Now, as I said just before we were in life,
236400	238280	Wolfgang kind of flew under the radar for me.
238280	239760	It kind of surprised me.
239760	244600	I got an email from his publicist and I had to check him out.
244600	246520	And they sent me a book.
246520	251320	This is Physics Assigned in Quest of Nontology.
251320	253760	And it was actually much more interesting
253760	255880	than I initially expected, Wolfgang.
255880	258840	You have a beautiful way of writing, honestly.
258840	260600	But I'm not bad.
260600	262120	But you also take no prisoners.
262120	265560	And I kind of like that.
265560	267320	Let me give you one example here.
267320	269320	And you said, I came upon the words,
269320	272080	there is no way to convince an expert that he or she has
272080	274400	done nonsense for 30 years.
274400	278120	I realized instantly that this person has something to say.
278120	280400	When I read that, I instantly realized
280400	282480	that Wolfgang has something to say to.
282480	290600	So it was kind of tongue-in-cheek, but I like it.
290600	293880	Well, the people who are listening right now
293880	301160	are from the idealist space, metaphysical idealism.
301160	307520	So we're already not really convinced of scientism.
307520	309880	But it doesn't mean that we have to talk about idealism.
309880	312240	But there's this little thing about,
312240	315320	I haven't read, I haven't come across this in this book.
315320	317640	So before we start, I'm actually kind of curious.
317640	322080	Just what are your thoughts on just consciousness?
322080	323720	I haven't seen the word in this book.
323720	326920	Maybe if you wrote about it, maybe you haven't.
326920	330760	But physicists have a lot to say about consciousness.
330760	333840	And idealists have a lot to say about consciousness.
333840	337120	But I haven't heard Wolfgang say anything about consciousness.
337120	339520	Is there anything you'd like to personally
339520	344160	or professionally say about that topic?
344160	349160	Well, I think the topic of consciousness
349160	354520	is obviously very central, very major.
354520	358960	And what I have to say about it, I think,
358960	366320	can best be described as being the very opposite of what
366320	374920	is nowadays involved regarding the subject of consciousness.
374920	385480	Because I am persuaded that instead of coming somehow
385480	392920	up from the bottom by some process of evolution,
392920	397080	consciousness is ultimately, in the final count,
397080	401280	what used to be called a Norman day.
401280	406520	It is actually rooted in divinity itself.
406520	411680	And by way of explication, let me mention
411680	418400	that the oldest tradition, intellectual tradition
418400	422040	in the world unquestionably is a Vedic.
422040	425920	And in the Vedic tradition, consciousness
425920	428840	is indeed a Norman day.
428840	436400	And it is part of the Sanskrit word satchitananda.
436400	443400	So satchitananda, these are three words put into one.
443400	446560	Sat means being.
446560	449920	Chit means consciousness.
449920	453400	And ananda means bliss.
453400	460120	So being consciousness and bliss are, so to speak,
460120	464160	the three aspects or faces, if you will,
464160	468320	of the divinity, the very, very first principle.
468320	475160	And I honestly believe that there is no other way
475160	478120	of really understanding consciousness.
478120	480000	It's not an epiphenomenon.
480000	484960	It has nothing whatsoever to do with neurons.
484960	489960	And in fact, it is rooted in the very, very first principle
489960	491720	of all, which is God.
494360	501760	So I think these remarks may suffice
501760	507920	to show that my thinking is really very far removed
507920	512400	from the contemporary, because the contemporary thinking
512400	516680	is characterized by the fact that almost instinctively,
516680	522440	contemporary Western man wants to understand everything
522440	528560	from the bottom, which he conceives more or less
528560	532880	in terms of quantum mechanics.
532880	539280	And this is, to me, the epitome of error.
539280	544000	And in fact, I would justify this claim
544000	552600	by pointing out that the contemporary metaphysics is
552600	557200	really nothing new, but it is a revival
557240	563360	of the philosophy of Democritus, who famously
563360	577600	said the Golger believed in qualities, color,
577600	580320	the sweet and the bitter.
580320	585920	But in reality, there is only atoms and the void.
585960	594440	So this is basically not only one
594440	598560	of the oldest philosophical positions of mankind,
598560	603520	but it has been revived in the 17th century,
603520	608520	and it has become our modern cradle.
608520	614480	And let me mention that very soon after Democritus
614480	621200	propounded his theory concerning atoms and the void,
621200	629840	Plato attacked it, and I believe rigorously disqualified
629840	633440	this position once and for all.
633440	637960	And so for 2,000 years thereafter,
637960	645800	the well-informed regarded this atomistic metaphysics
645800	647760	as a heresy.
647760	652080	And so what happened in the 17th century
652080	658640	under the aegis of people like Descartes and Galileo,
658640	665880	that ancient heresy was revived and became
665880	672320	the foundation of what we nowadays call the Enlightenment.
672320	681720	So this is, so to speak, the historical overview of where
681720	685400	we find ourselves today.
685400	691920	And needless to say, I have been an opponent
691920	700720	of the current Weltanschauung since the age of 14, really.
700720	703800	Really, what happened when you were 14?
703800	706680	That made that happen?
706680	711960	Well, I think the decisive event was that somehow or other,
711960	716600	I came across a very important book,
716600	722160	a book by Alfred North Whitehead entitled
722160	725520	Science in the Modern World.
725520	727920	I read this book with great interest.
727920	735040	I don't think I understood that much because I was very young.
735040	743800	But I understood enough to be fascinated and, in a sense,
743800	750720	to be devoted to these questions for the rest of my life.
754200	761960	So Whitehead, as it were, awakened my philosophical interest
761960	767000	and instincts, if you will, instinctively
767000	771600	when I read about the fallacy of misplaced concreteness
771600	775640	and these things, I realized that this must be true.
778200	785560	And so this started me on a career which
785560	789000	put me in the position of the outsider
789000	793240	from the very beginning.
793240	796240	I always felt myself as an outsider
796240	799520	in the contemporary Western culture.
799520	804280	And the reason was that I felt myself as an insider
804280	810240	when it comes to the ancient philosophies, primarily
810240	812720	Platonism.
812720	817920	So in Platonism, I felt that I was an insider.
817920	819960	Not that I understood it that well,
819960	824000	but instinctively I was drawn to it.
824080	830440	And something within me assured me
830440	833720	that this must be the truth.
833720	840400	And incidentally, Platonism doesn't stand alone.
840400	848280	It is inherently the same as the Vedic tradition.
848280	851160	There are certain differences.
851160	853600	But in essence, it is the same doctrine.
856160	867760	And as I said, the contemporary Weltanschauung,
867760	872400	which is regards particles of some kind or another
872400	878320	as a very basis from which everything else evolves,
878320	887480	that Weltanschauung is really nothing new at all.
887480	890680	As I said, it goes back to the Democritus.
890680	893720	And you might say it is one of the oldest heresies
893720	896520	in the history of human thought.
896520	898800	You're not a fan of atomistic thinking.
898800	902880	That's certainly what I got it from reading your book.
902880	909080	And you even go as far as to say that there are no,
909080	910560	that particles do not exist.
914840	923280	Yes, when you really pursue the Platonist metaphysics
923280	932440	and apply it to the contemporary panorama of physics
932520	935720	with its division between classical physics and quantum
935720	944200	physics, you find, and this came to me as an amazement,
944200	949880	you find that everything falls into place.
949880	953960	And you can, in fact, understand this division
953960	958760	between classical physics and quantum physics
958760	965080	in a brand new way, which finally makes sense.
965080	967800	I really like you to go deeper into that,
967800	972320	or at least explain your solution to this problem.
972320	976240	So if you can briefly state the problem,
976240	977320	and then your solution.
981560	987480	Yes, let me just say by way of introduction
987480	993680	that the Platonist metaphysics is, in a sense,
993680	1001400	the diametric opposite of what contemporary intellectuals
1001400	1007080	believe, because contemporary intellectuals
1007080	1012440	believe that it all begins with atoms.
1013440	1020840	Nowadays, this is conceived evidently in quantum mechanical terms,
1020840	1027240	but metaphysically speaking, it's just atoms and the void,
1027240	1032840	very much as the democratus conceived of it.
1032840	1038240	It's the beginning of the fifth century BC.
1039240	1045520	So in a sense, you can say there's nothing new under the sun,
1045520	1051400	because stripped of its technical aspects,
1051400	1057280	the contemporary worldview is basically
1057280	1060160	democratus all over again.
1060200	1069800	And it is as much a heresy today as it was in the early days
1069800	1071640	of democratus.
1071640	1077200	In other words, it is simply false to say
1077200	1083760	that everything arises from particles.
1083760	1088800	There's no evidence to that effect.
1088800	1092600	People may think so, but if you dig into it a little bit more
1092600	1100160	deeply, you find that all these purported scenarios really
1100160	1103560	prove to be baseless.
1103560	1110600	And if you go into it with any kind of mathematical depths,
1110600	1117800	you find quickly enough that this contemporary scenario, which
1117800	1124440	tries to reduce everything to aggregates of particles,
1124440	1128280	actually proves to be impossible.
1128280	1133400	And in fact, it may interest many people
1133400	1142200	to know that starting in the year 1998,
1142200	1147160	this philosophy, this Belt and Schoen,
1147160	1149680	has really been disproved.
1149680	1154240	It turns out to be mathematically impossible.
1154240	1159240	And it is very simple.
1159240	1162320	I think I can explain that in a few words,
1162320	1165640	comprehensible to the non-specialists.
1165640	1180280	If you start out with particles, then you need to talk about evolution.
1180280	1185440	You need to introduce this term, because somehow these particles
1185440	1189320	have to give rise to all that there is,
1189320	1201760	beginning with the planetary system and the simplest organic structures.
1201760	1207560	So everything has to arise by way of quote unquote evolution.
1207560	1213120	This is the given, because obviously we live not in a world of particles,
1213120	1221520	but in a world of something which may conceivably reduce
1221520	1229600	an aggregate of particles, but it certainly is not what appears to us.
1229600	1239840	So what I'm trying to say is that if you base yourself on an ontology
1239840	1246400	of particles, then evolution is an absolute necessity
1246400	1252360	to go from these particles to the world which we inhabit.
1252360	1256160	Because the world which we inhabit is more than some of its parts.
1256160	1262600	It's also one of the things you seem to keep pressing on in this book of yours,
1262600	1268200	that there is an irreducible hole that you cannot take apart,
1268240	1274160	you cannot atomize it, and this is also one of the things you stress.
1274160	1283480	Yes, yes, I do stress this, but the point, Jack, is that
1283480	1289880	according to the contemporary scientific mindset,
1289880	1294280	everything does reduce to a sum of parts.
1294320	1298520	This is what our Weltanschauung insists upon.
1298520	1304000	Physics by its very modus operandi assumes this much.
1304000	1309920	The only reason physics can understand an object, whatever it may be,
1309920	1316600	is that object is a sum of parts, because that's how physics operates.
1316600	1320520	That's where differential equations come into the picture.
1320520	1329680	So our contemporary science is predicated upon this assumption
1329680	1336840	that the world consists of sums of parts.
1336840	1343880	And now I wanted to point out that it turns out,
1343880	1350120	and incidentally that's another way of introducing the idea of evolution.
1350120	1351840	It's the same thing.
1351840	1359040	If you start with particles, then the world and everything in it
1359040	1362200	is a result of evolution.
1362200	1365520	These parts come together to form holes,
1365520	1372600	and so you get ever more complicated aggregates of particles.
1372600	1378520	And this is the explanation of the world in which we find ourselves.
1378520	1389480	But it turns out that this basic premise is untenable.
1389480	1397240	And that is a direct consequence
1397240	1401760	over a rigorous mathematical theorem
1401760	1412560	proved in the year 1998 by an American mathematician named William Demsky.
1412560	1418080	And what Demsky proved is really very, very simple,
1418080	1424280	although the proof is not very simple, but the idea is very simple.
1424280	1435240	Demsky proved that if you have something sufficiently complicated,
1435240	1443000	then it becomes mathematically impossible to suppose
1443000	1451880	that this entity came about by chance.
1451880	1461200	If you have some stochastic random process like tossing a coin,
1461200	1470760	the likelihood that this will somehow spell out all the volumes
1470760	1475720	in the Library of Congress in their chronological order
1475720	1481680	is so small that it is rigorously impossible.
1481680	1490600	And this is what Demsky proved in this so-called intelligent design theorem,
1490600	1497800	which was published in a book in Cambridge University Press in 1998.
1497800	1506640	So what the theorem of Demsky affirms is that
1506640	1513800	a causality operating in time, which is a causality of physics,
1513800	1521640	cannot produce what is called complex specified information.
1521640	1526520	And with this causality, you specifically refer to horizontal causation.
1526520	1529640	Yes, so horizontal causation.
1529640	1533760	So when I saw this term for the first time, or this vertical causation,
1533760	1538080	and I've never heard of it before, immediately I thought,
1538080	1540080	okay, so what does Wolfgang mean?
1540080	1543640	Because by that point I had not read your book,
1543640	1549080	and I can imagine you have on the one hand a cause,
1549080	1552880	which leads to an effect, and that effect can be another cause.
1552880	1555760	And we imagine this, at least in the Western world,
1555760	1558760	because we do not have circular time in our Western thinking.
1558760	1560560	We have a linear time going,
1560560	1564320	and it usually is imagined from the left to the right.
1564320	1567560	So that seems to me the horizontal causation,
1567560	1571720	but you introduce an idea which is vertical causation,
1571720	1578480	which might explain some instant annuity.
1578480	1581960	Sorry, but I just wanted to...
1581960	1584040	You're absolutely right.
1584040	1589800	What Demsky's theorem affirms, to put it in my language,
1589840	1592480	is that horizontal causation,
1592480	1596280	the causation upon which physics is based,
1596280	1601680	cannot produce complex specified information.
1601680	1608000	And since even the simplest forms of life, an amoeba,
1608000	1613440	as it were, embodies huge quantities
1613440	1617360	of complex specified information,
1617360	1622680	it follows from Demsky's theorem that a natural process,
1622680	1625920	a process that physics can understand,
1625920	1632160	could not have formed that organic organism, that amoeba.
1632160	1638640	So the point that I'm making is that, actually,
1638640	1645600	with Demsky's theorem, evolution, as we normally conceive of it,
1645600	1650720	has become mathematically impossible.
1650720	1662720	And the fact that this basic discovery is very much suppressed,
1662720	1672160	this is not what you will learn at any reputable university.
1672160	1675920	There are no courses in Harvard or Princeton
1675920	1679920	that will tell you these things.
1679920	1688320	It shows that when it comes to Weltanschauung,
1688320	1697520	the matter is not based on pure simple logic.
1697520	1699720	I mean, we are human.
1699720	1703840	Ideology comes into play.
1703840	1714000	So as a general statement of what I discovered rather early in life,
1714000	1719960	is that our so-called scientific Weltanschauung,
1719960	1723440	which entails the idea, for example, of evolution and life
1723440	1728640	springing from the mental particles, ultimately,
1728640	1735480	that this is not a scientific fact.
1735480	1737400	There's no proof of this.
1737400	1742240	On the contrary, I've just said there are mathematical theorems
1742240	1745280	that disprove that possibility.
1745280	1751880	But the point is that our Weltanschauung, which claims to be scientific,
1751880	1761440	and if you will, objective is, in fact, ideology-driven.
1761440	1763040	I agree.
1763040	1764440	Yeah, Brian, go ahead.
1764440	1765560	I just wanted to add something.
1765560	1768000	Wolfgang uses the word Weltanschauung, which
1768000	1771720	is a German word that just means world view
1771720	1773680	or how one looks out upon the world.
1773680	1777000	But just going back to your question, Jack,
1777000	1779080	if I could reintroduce, you had the question
1779080	1782320	about the Wolfgang's resolution to the quantum enigma.
1782320	1787880	And Wolfgang, before you came across Dempke's theorem in 1998,
1787880	1790040	you wrote a book called The Quantum Enigma, Finding
1790040	1796960	the Hidden Key, in which you pick up on Heisenberg's description
1796960	1799480	of what quantum reality is.
1799480	1802000	And this is what leads you down the path to your resolution.
1802000	1806560	So maybe you could talk about where you picked up from Heisenberg
1806560	1811520	and how you came to this resolution.
1811520	1812020	All right.
1824600	1828200	Quantum theory was discovered in the early decades
1828200	1830560	of the 20th century.
1830560	1837400	And very soon after its discovery,
1837400	1845040	a problem confronted the physicists, which
1845040	1848520	they were unable to resolve.
1848520	1850960	And that is the following.
1850960	1855800	Quantum theory describes a physical system
1855800	1859400	by a so-called wave function.
1859400	1864000	And in that wave function description,
1864000	1870200	the physical systems behave in a very weird way.
1870200	1873760	Particles, for example, multilocate.
1873760	1881600	And you are in a realm totally different from the world
1881600	1888120	as we know it in our daily life.
1888120	1892920	But when you, for example, set up an experiment
1892920	1900440	to measure the position of this, say, multi-locating particle,
1900440	1905160	you find that at the instant of measurement,
1905160	1908680	the particle ceases to multi-locate
1908680	1916080	and actually presents itself at some particular location
1916080	1918920	in space.
1918920	1921840	And this, of course, is very puzzling.
1921840	1924920	How does this miracle arise?
1924920	1934080	That in an instant, a system completely changes
1934080	1940600	and becomes something that it was not before.
1940600	1944160	This is called the measurement problem.
1944160	1950200	And I became very interested in that problem.
1950200	1955400	It was about 1995, the abouts.
1955400	1964640	And I finally became convinced that I
1964640	1968680	see the one and only way to resolve it.
1968680	1973000	And I wrote a book to that effect on that subject
1973000	1981480	called the quantum enigma, where I start from the ground up
1981480	1991480	and develop the idea, ideas, actually two of them,
1991480	1996480	that are needed to resolve this problem.
1996480	2000520	And there are two ideas that you need.
2000520	2007680	The first idea is the fact that the perceptible world, which
2007680	2011040	is really the world in which we find ourselves,
2011040	2014880	happens not to be a quantum world.
2014880	2018400	It happens not to be even just the physical world.
2018400	2022320	So the world as a physicist conceives of it
2022320	2024560	is not the full world.
2024560	2025840	There's more.
2025840	2028360	And if there were not more, for example,
2028360	2032960	there could be no perception, there could be no life.
2032960	2038760	So I made the basic ontological distinction
2038760	2044280	between a corporeal entity and the physical entity.
2044280	2048880	Now a corporeal entity is a kind of entity
2048880	2052720	which we encounter in our normal daily life.
2053480	2058960	It's something that we perceive as our senses
2058960	2066720	and something that has a reality, transcending what
2066720	2074440	the physicist can describe in abstract mathematical terms.
2074440	2080640	Now every corporeal object X has associated with it
2080640	2084560	a physical object, call it Sx.
2084560	2088280	In other words, the physical object
2088280	2096880	that classical physics deals with are corporeal objects
2096880	2101280	as conceived by the physicist.
2101280	2105480	So there's a difference between the corporeal object
2105520	2114840	X and the object Sx, which is the physicist's conception
2114840	2117200	of a corporeal object.
2117200	2120880	I would say that the corporeal object will be not
2120880	2122560	reducible to each part.
2122560	2127160	And the physical object S, or at least an abstract object,
2127160	2132120	will be decomposable into parts the atomistic way.
2132160	2134160	Yes, you're absolutely right.
2134160	2139240	Only at this point in the quantum enigma,
2139240	2145400	I had not yet introduced this idea of irreducible wholeness.
2145400	2150840	I simply distinguished the object
2150840	2156800	that we know in daily life through our normal senses
2156800	2160640	from the corresponding physical object,
2160640	2164560	which is reduced.
2164560	2168800	It is limited by the physicist's assumptions.
2168800	2171480	So you have to distinguish these two objects.
2171480	2172880	They're not the same.
2172880	2177360	So there's a distinction between a corporeal object X
2177360	2181480	and the physicist's concept of that, which
2181480	2184680	I call the corresponding physical object.
2184680	2187120	But does its physical object actually exist,
2187120	2189080	or is it just an abstraction?
2191600	2194040	The abstraction of the corporeal objects.
2194040	2195720	It does exist.
2195720	2198800	I mean, the physicist does not deal with non-entities.
2198800	2200800	Yes, it has an existence.
2200800	2202440	The important thing is that you need
2202440	2204680	to distinguish between the two.
2204680	2206720	They're not the same thing.
2206720	2210200	And as long as you don't see that distinction,
2210200	2214160	you will not be able to solve the measuring problem.
2214160	2217920	And this is why this measuring problem has been kicked
2217920	2221800	around by top scientists, top physicists,
2221800	2224200	for close to 100 years now.
2224200	2231480	And actually, it has not been solved by these considerations.
2231480	2235400	Because in fact, it cannot be solved on that basis.
2235400	2238120	And the reason it cannot be solved on that basis
2238120	2243360	is that the crux of the matter is this distinction
2243400	2248320	between the corporeal entity X and the associated physical
2248320	2249640	entity Sx.
2249640	2252080	They're not the same.
2252080	2254480	The corporeal is more.
2254480	2260000	And it is this more that is the decisive factor
2260000	2264600	in the measurement problem.
2264600	2267760	And so I think physicists are still
2267760	2271280	thinking of the measurement problem.
2271320	2274360	The fact is that they cannot solve it
2274360	2277840	on the basis of physics.
2277840	2282880	So what I showed in this 1995 book, The Quantum Enigma,
2282880	2288120	is that in a sense, physics is limited.
2288120	2290600	It doesn't deal with everything.
2290600	2294640	And it is, in fact, so limited that it
2294640	2300320	is incapable of recognizing its own limitation.
2300320	2306360	The fact that the physicist's world is not the entire world,
2306360	2308400	that's a basic fact.
2308400	2312720	And unless you understand the basic facts,
2312720	2318560	you will not be able to correctly understand anything.
2318560	2322640	But this basic fact is invisible to physics,
2322640	2324920	by definition, if you will.
2324920	2327840	Could you say, I was going to ask Wolfgang,
2327840	2333360	could you say that Sx exists insofar as it participates in X
2333360	2335120	or partakes of X?
2335120	2341960	Yes, it derives its being from X.
2341960	2345520	And this is a major factor.
2345520	2349920	But this being that the physical object derives
2349920	2355000	from the corporeal is something entirely invisible
2355000	2357320	to the physicist.
2357320	2362880	Because in fact, being as such is invisible to the physicist,
2362880	2366680	because being is not a sum of parts.
2366680	2373200	And all the physicists can ever see is sums of parts.
2373200	2376000	That's why differential equations come into play,
2376000	2382960	because when you deal with things that do reduce the sum of parts,
2382960	2388280	these things then are amenable to study
2388280	2392120	by means of differential equations.
2392120	2395000	I used to always have trouble with the concept of something
2395000	2397760	being more than the sum of its parts,
2397760	2402080	until I heard an example by John Feveki.
2402080	2407360	He's, I think, a cognitive scientist, not sure.
2407360	2409840	And he gave the example of the Necker cube,
2409880	2414280	the two-dimensional drawing of a three-dimensional cube
2414280	2415640	in a wire frame.
2415640	2419120	And you can flip that inside and outside.
2419120	2422560	And he said, well, you have this two-dimensional drawing,
2422560	2424880	but the three-dimensional projection
2424880	2428000	you have in your head, that's the thing that is more
2428000	2429480	than the sum of its parts.
2429480	2433240	So only until then I kind of understood
2433240	2434520	what it really meant for something
2434520	2436360	to be more than the sum of its parts.
2436360	2438760	It's not something emergent, or there's
2438760	2442400	something that is not, you can't reduce the three-dimensional
2442400	2445200	image in your head to the lines on the paper.
2445200	2448040	And there has to be something more.
2448040	2449720	Anyway, I just wanted to add that.
2449720	2456560	Well, this example that John Feveki gave you
2456560	2459960	is very, very interesting and very fascinating.
2459960	2466200	But let me point out that it is not necessary to go to something
2466200	2470880	as high-falutely as this example,
2470880	2476760	because take, for example, any quality, say, color,
2476760	2479800	the color red.
2479800	2484120	The color red, obviously, is not a sum of parts
2484120	2486960	because it doesn't even have parts.
2489800	2491640	That's a good one.
2491720	2497960	It was Aristotle, really, who recognized
2497960	2502480	the difference between quantities and qualities.
2502480	2506480	And the point is that qualities are characterized
2506480	2509400	by the fact that they have no parts.
2509640	2528920	So the upshot is that physics and our physical sciences deal
2528920	2535760	with a very limited aspect of reality.
2535760	2540560	And in fact, this is where its power comes from.
2540560	2547400	I always like to quote Goethe, who has said so many wise things.
2547400	2552080	And one of them is, quote, you understand it,
2552080	2555800	in the Beschränkung zeigt sich der Meister.
2555800	2561040	In limitation, the master shows himself.
2561040	2565080	So the point is that physics gains its power
2565080	2568440	through the enormity of its limitation.
2568440	2570480	And what is that limitation?
2570480	2576440	The limitation is that it will concentrate entirely
2576440	2578760	upon quantities.
2578760	2585600	The physicist has no eye for qualities.
2585600	2587440	He sees no color.
2587440	2590600	He sees nothing but quantities.
2590600	2594080	And therefore, he sees nothing but sums of parts.
2594080	2597120	This is an enormous limitation.
2597120	2600960	And it is the enormity of this limitation
2600960	2605960	that gives physics its equally enormous power.
2608600	2615520	So this, if I had any influence upon universities, which I don't,
2615520	2619440	this is what I would like to convey to the students,
2619440	2622040	because it makes for wisdom.
2622040	2626520	It makes for real understanding.
2626520	2634960	Our scientific Weltanschauung is bought at a cost.
2634960	2639920	We pay something to get that Weltanschauung.
2639920	2646080	And what we pay, in other words, what we lose in the process,
2646080	2653800	is the qualitative side of the world,
2653800	2661080	which we completely leave out of account
2661080	2663800	in our physical sciences.
2667880	2675600	So actually, if you want to be very precise, very rigorous,
2675600	2685880	you could say that there is no contemporary scientific Weltanschauung
2685880	2692120	for the simple reason that our sciences are based upon physics.
2692120	2700640	And the physical world cannot really be looked upon at all.
2700640	2707440	The only way you can deal with it is through mathematical equations.
2707440	2714200	And so in order to make a Weltanschauung out of the findings of physics,
2714200	2719240	we have to add something to that,
2719240	2725160	which cannot in any way be based upon physics.
2725160	2730400	So in a sense, our contemporary Weltanschauung is a fake.
2730440	2732400	It is a fallacy.
2732400	2734880	It's a contradiction in terms,
2734880	2740720	because if the world were really what the physicist takes it to be,
2740720	2744960	that does not give rise to Weltanschauung.
2744960	2749920	This is nothing that you can tell the non-physicist,
2749920	2753720	aha, that's what the world is like,
2753720	2760280	because all that remains basically are equations.
2760280	2766120	And the non-specialist doesn't understand these equations,
2766120	2771080	nor does it make any sense to say that in reality,
2771080	2774520	the world reduces to equations.
2774520	2777560	This is really nonsense.
2777560	2781440	And this is why I like the saying of Goethe so much,
2781440	2793520	because this Goethe's dictum really tells us why the physicist's Weltanschauung
2793520	2796040	is not a Weltanschauung at all,
2796040	2801640	unless he added something, an ingredient which is not part of physics,
2801640	2806640	he couldn't speak to the non-physicist.
2806640	2808240	Can I quote you from your book?
2808240	2810920	I just remind me of something you wrote.
2811000	2812000	Please.
2812000	2813000	Please.
2813000	2820200	You said that people today model along and don't even know anymore what is model
2820200	2824600	and what is fact, and it's something that I find is really a good quote.
2824600	2829000	It made me chuckle a bit.
2829000	2832080	I had the same thing when I was younger.
2832080	2836000	It almost feels like the scientific worldview,
2836000	2839560	which isn't actually a worldview,
2839600	2842800	but it pretends to be one, at least.
2842800	2845120	But it doesn't tell you it is.
2845120	2850160	I had to find out later that there is a distinction between modeling the world
2850160	2852800	or describing the world and the world in itself,
2852800	2857920	and the model of the world is not the same thing as the world.
2857920	2861960	And I can understand why people get confused, let's say,
2861960	2865800	and we need people like Wolfgang and other people
2865800	2871000	to reintroduce this classical idea, actually.
2871000	2873000	We seem to have forgotten that.
2873000	2877000	So I just wanted to add that.
2877000	2889480	Yes, as a result of this dominance of physical science in our time,
2889480	2899160	our intellectuals have become very, very confused.
2899160	2905800	And in these days of mass communication,
2905800	2910040	these ideas remain not only amongst the intellectuals.
2910040	2913960	It pervades our civilization.
2913960	2916360	I think nowadays, even in grade school,
2916360	2923640	we would give more information about atoms and particles and so on.
2923640	2932920	So we are very, very confused people, seriously confused.
2932920	2941960	And it, of course, affects our entire civilization profoundly.
2941960	2947240	I mean, for example, the arts are profoundly affected
2947240	2954840	by this so-called scientific Weltanschauung,
2954840	2958760	which is, I have just tried to explain, is really a fake.
2958760	2964120	It is really a fake.
2964120	2972360	But these things are not easy to understand intellectually.
2972360	2981080	It requires certain qualifications, which are apparently quite rare.
2981080	2991160	And so the confusion remains and, in fact, perpetuates itself.
2991160	2999080	And it's getting worse and worse.
2999080	3001960	We are very, very confused people.
3001960	3006520	And it is affecting our culture as a whole.
3006520	3015720	And to the extent that one actually sees what is going on,
3015720	3020360	one cannot but be very worried.
3021080	3029240	Wolfgang, you introduced a concept as a correlation to horizontal causation,
3029240	3030520	it's vertical causation.
3030520	3035880	And you picked up on where Heisenberg said something about quantum particles,
3035880	3038760	that they're somewhere between being and non-being.
3038760	3041400	It has such a reminiscent of Aristotelian potentiae.
3041400	3044360	And this is something you picked up on.
3044360	3046760	And you said something interesting, you're quoted in your documentary,
3046760	3051000	saying that no one on either side of the Copenhagen debate
3051000	3053960	seemed to have realized that it was the role of quantum particles
3053960	3057160	not to bestow, but to receive being.
3057160	3063560	And so this plays into your idea of vertical causation,
3063560	3065640	which Jack had alluded to earlier.
3065640	3071560	Yeah. I want to respond to what you have just said, Brian,
3071880	3077720	because it touches upon something very, very major.
3077720	3083320	Heisenberg was a very, very unusual physicist.
3083320	3092280	He was different from all the other physicists by the fact that he was the son of a classicist.
3093000	3099480	His father was a classicist and Heisenberg himself was very
3099480	3105800	worth in, say, the philosophy of Plato, the philosophy of Aristotle.
3106520	3115080	He had a high degree of insight into these ancient doctrines.
3115080	3119560	And that set him off from the rest of the physicists.
3120520	3130600	And he was really alone among physicists to recognize that
3133240	3138600	these so-called quantum particles really had no being.
3138920	3149400	Physicists by and large regarded these particles as the ultimate building blocks of the world
3150360	3161160	when, in fact, Heisenberg, due to his knowledge of ancient philosophy,
3161880	3168520	recognized that they could not be that because, in fact, they lack being.
3169320	3175560	You cannot build a world out of things which don't exist, which don't have being.
3176680	3184360	So on the other hand, Heisenberg never managed to
3185240	3196360	take these recognitions all the way and build what might be called a complete
3196360	3202440	philosophy of physics, which puts everything in its right place.
3203160	3214840	He never managed to do that, but he did recognize the fact that quantum particles
3215720	3222760	are potentie, that means they don't really exist, but they are
3223080	3229480	material in relation to form.
3231480	3246360	So I picked up, as it were, on this note and I recognized
3246360	3259000	very clearly that this is what the measurement problem is all about.
3261000	3272600	When you measure a quantum system, you give being to some entities which previously were mere
3272680	3286040	potency, and if a measuring instrument were itself a quantum system, you obviously couldn't do that.
3287240	3299960	Somewhere along the line, you need to bring into play some entities which have being
3299960	3312200	so that they can then affect the transition from the potency of a quantum particle
3312200	3316440	to the actuality of a measurement of a measured system.
3317080	3333240	So I realized that there is an ontological difference between an ordinary corporeal entity,
3333240	3341880	the kind of entities that we encounter in our conscious life, a chair, a table,
3342520	3349240	or anything that you can pick up, anything that you can actually perceive.
3350520	3359400	So these are corporeal entities and they are ontologically different from a mere quantum system,
3359960	3364520	because they do have, being a quantum system does not.
3365480	3374920	So based upon this very, very simple recognition, I found a very, very simple solution
3374920	3383080	to the so-called measurement problem. The point is, in order to measure a quantum system,
3383880	3391880	you need, which is a mere potency, a mere potency, you need something that is more than a potency
3392440	3401800	and these kind of entities are called corporeal entities. The chair I'm sitting on is corporeal,
3401800	3414120	otherwise I couldn't sit on it. So the first new idea that I introduced and that needs to be
3414120	3421480	introduced, if you want to solve the measurement problem, is the distinction between a corporeal
3422440	3430520	entity and the associated physical entity, so the corporeal entity is more and this more
3430520	3439960	is essential in the act of measurement. But that was not enough in order to
3440600	3459320	to complete the argument, you need to recognize that if measurement is a transition from potency
3459320	3473560	to act, you need a corresponding causality, because the transition from potency to act
3477160	3483720	cannot take place in time, it can only be instantaneous, because there's nothing in between
3484680	3494600	the potency and act. So it is an instantaneous effect. Now physics deals with a causality,
3494600	3503000	which I call horizontal causality, which itself takes place in time. That's why you can write a
3503000	3511960	differential equation, because this is a causality which is really a process in time. But the causality
3511960	3523080	that you need in order to measure a quantum system cannot be a causality that takes place in time,
3523080	3532680	because as I said, it has to be instantaneous. And so this led to the discovery, if you will, of
3533240	3540120	so-called vertical causation. Vertical causation is an entirely different kind of causation,
3540920	3546520	and it is characterized by the fact that it takes place instantaneously.
3548520	3557720	And so these are the two ontological ideas that I introduced in 1995,
3558680	3569800	in connection with the measurement problem. And let me just point out that it was very
3569800	3578520	interesting that three years later, exactly, William Demsky wrote his book on intelligent design,
3579560	3586120	in which he proved that theorem, which I have just mentioned, to the effect that it takes
3587000	3600280	vertical causality to effect, to produce complex specified information. So I guess the time for
3600280	3614280	the discovery of vertical causality had come, because two independent books demonstrated
3614280	3620760	the need for that kind of causality. Where does that causality come from, this vertical causality?
3621880	3625880	Excuse me, Jack. Where does this vertical causality come from?
3626760	3637480	Ah, well, that is a wonderful question, because actually it turns out that you can have vertical
3637480	3648520	causality only in a Platonist cosmos. You need a cosmos as Plato himself conceived of it,
3649720	3662840	because the Platonist cosmos is inherently tripartite. It consists of three levels, if you will,
3663720	3671160	in which the first level, the highest level, what Plato called the intelligible,
3675000	3690440	is not subject to either space or time. And it is this intelligible, I call it,
3690520	3695800	eternal level from which vertical causation emanates.
3697160	3701640	Can you please help me with the word eternal? My spellchecker keeps telling me this word doesn't
3701640	3706680	exist, and I was just curious. I've never come across it. I think it's a beautiful word, but it's it.
3707000	3718600	Well, the word goes back to the Christian middle ages, where
3721640	3735320	the scholastic philosophers recognized that there is a level in the cosmos
3736280	3749480	beyond space and time. So then your question is, what is it that distinguishes this kind of eternity
3750200	3758680	from what theologians want to call eternity? And the answer was given by Thomas Aquinas,
3759640	3778360	who said that the eternal realm is not subject to time, but time can be added onto it.
3778680	3789320	These are the words. That means, even though eternity has no time,
3790840	3801320	it is really part of a cosmos in which time does exist. So it's a very sharp distinction,
3802120	3811160	but very, very essential from a metaphysical point of view, because the eternity of the
3811960	3823720	highest cosmic sphere is not to be equated to the eternity that, properly speaking, belongs to
3824680	3834680	God himself, who is the creator of the world. So the eternity of God is more than the eternity
3835320	3845480	of the highest cosmic sphere. Right, and this is where the this eternity is, where the vertical
3845560	3855640	causation comes from. Exactly. The vertical causation in so far as it does not happen in time,
3856600	3867640	it therefore comes from the eternal plane. It emanates, let's say. It doesn't emerge.
3867880	3870920	Emanates, is there any metaphor we can use for this?
3874360	3884120	There really is not, because here we are dealing with the deepest metaphysical problems,
3884840	3893560	which being basic cannot be further reduced, so to speak. Fair enough.
3894280	3909560	So after writing this book on the quantum enigma, I began to realize that the key
3910440	3921640	to all these metaphysical questions relating to the nature of physics and the physical world
3923800	3930760	need to be resolved on a Platonist basis. I've always instinctively been a Platonist,
3931400	3939320	but it was after this rather intense work I put in on the quantum enigma,
3939320	3947560	that it became more clear to me than ever before that in order to understand physics,
3948200	3956680	we need to go back to the Platonist philosophy. This is really the key, this is the right way
3956680	3966360	of doing it, and let me say that in light of my latest book, where I actually carry out,
3966360	3983240	if you will, that plan, I am very gratified and in a way amazed to see that if you look at physics
3983240	3990760	from a rigorous Platonist point of view, everything becomes very, very simple.
3990760	4000200	And not only does it become very, very simple, but you also at the same time realize
4000840	4010600	that the actual story is the very opposite of what physicists nowadays believe. It's
4010600	4020280	the very opposite because basically physicists start with particles and then they want to
4020280	4032520	from particles step by step build a universe. And it turns out from the Platonist point of view
4032520	4042600	that I've just alluded to, that the true story is just the other way around. Particles come at
4042600	4051960	the very end and they even have no being. So the real anthology starts from just the opposite
4051960	4058200	direction. The true anthology is top down, it is not bottom up.
4060120	4068760	Interesting. Wolfgang, if I could ask a question, you introduced a reminder that it was reported,
4068840	4075080	reportedly said or written above the Platonic Academy at Athens, let no one ignorant of geometry
4075080	4083480	enter here. And I think this informed your concept of the tripartite cosmos and a tripartite man.
4084280	4093560	And it takes shape of an icon of a circle with a center point. And would it be fair to characterize
4093560	4102440	this icon reflecting the human person, let's say, or any created entity? Well, in particular,
4102440	4107320	you introduced the intellect, the idea of the intellect. So you reintroduced a distinction
4107320	4115560	between the intellect and reason and then the corporeal. The intellect is instantaneous. It's
4115560	4123000	not constrained by time or space and it's how we perceive things. And this is, you did quite a
4123000	4127720	bit of research into James J. Gibson's theory of ecological perception which supported this.
4127720	4132920	And then there's the distinction between the intellectual moving into the rational, which is
4132920	4139560	discursive thought that takes place in time but requires no space. And then being terminates on
4139560	4145480	the level of the corporeal, let's say, where the person manifests him or herself in space and time.
4145480	4149240	And so each person has these three aspects to their nature, the intelligible,
4150200	4153800	they have access to this where there's no space, no time, they have access to the
4154760	4160360	reason and the rational discursive thought in time, no space, and the corporeal. So maybe
4161640	4167560	I know Jack was interested in your research on James J. Gibson and how this ties into that concept.
4168120	4181400	Well, you raise a very fundamental question. I think the first thing that I should point out is that
4182280	4201480	it is very enlightening to associate the Platonist doctrine of the three levels of the cosmos
4202280	4210040	with the bounds of space and time. And incidentally, I don't see this
4213640	4218360	talked about in the Platonist philosophy.
4221640	4226600	They must have known it because they were very wise and this is very basic,
4227320	4236600	but I don't find it written about, say, in the Timaeus or the other relevant dialogues.
4237480	4248920	The point is this. Platonism distinguishes three levels of the cosmos. The supreme level,
4248920	4258520	which is beyond time, is called the intelligible, I call it the eternal.
4260920	4269800	The second level, which the Platonists call the psychic or the vital, I call it the intermediary.
4270680	4278680	The second level, I say, and this I do not find explicitly in the Platonist dialogues,
4279320	4289080	the second level is subject to time but not to space. So the intermediary level, which is a psychic,
4289960	4298760	is subject to time but not to space. And then, of course, as you would expect,
4299400	4308520	the third or lowest, what we call the corporeal level, is subject to both time and space.
4309560	4317800	So you have these three levels of the cosmos and you can, if you will, define them in terms of the
4317880	4325480	two bounds, time and space. There is a level that is subject to neither, there's a level that is
4325480	4331640	subject to time but not to space, and then there's a level that is subject to both. So this is very
4331640	4350600	simple. And amazing consequences fall there and so from this way of looking at the matter.
4350840	4364680	And I think perhaps the one that will interest our listeners the most is the fact that the existence
4365480	4376120	of a time-only level of the cosmos, the existence of what I call the intermediary plane,
4376840	4387720	in itself disproves or disqualifies Einstein and relativity. Einstein and relativity, which
4389640	4401400	it is, were fuses space and time in what is called spacetime. If Einstein were right,
4401640	4412440	there could be no cosmic realm, subject to time but not to space, because space and time are,
4412440	4425640	so to speak, two different aspects of a spacetime, which includes both. So one of the obviously
4425640	4439640	most interesting consequences of this recognition of the Platonist ontology as affirming an intermediary
4439640	4448120	realm, subject to time alone, one most amazing consequences of this is that it disqualifies
4448120	4462520	Einstein and relativity at a single scale. So sorry, and sometimes I agree.
4463320	4469320	Well, that was something I would like to, before I forget, I didn't have many questions, but there
4469320	4476680	was a paper you mentioned by J. Gibson. I just mentioned it yourself too, and I haven't read
4476680	4487000	papers simply because I'm not really good at reading papers, but I hope you can summarize the
4487640	4493960	general idea behind it, because all I understand from it is that we see reality how it is.
4495080	4502280	That's what I read in your book or in the key points, that we see reality as it is.
4502280	4509960	What does Gibson mean by that? Well, I'm so glad you brought up the name of James Gibson,
4510600	4519640	because I really think he is one of the absolutely most important scientists of the 20th century,
4520360	4534440	because he has single-handedly corrected a major mistake of post-Cartesian science
4537000	4547720	by rediscovering the fact that in visual perception, what you actually perceive
4548520	4559080	is not inside the head, it's in the external world itself. We do perceive mountains and trees,
4559720	4568440	and we do perceive color. So in my language, what we perceive is exactly the corporeal world
4568440	4581240	as distinguished from the physical. It is an amazing achievement on the part of Gibson
4581960	4592040	to have actually formulated in rigorous empirical terms a theory of visual perception,
4592680	4600600	which completely breaks with the so-called retinal image theory, which as we know,
4601480	4608600	think of perception as a process originating in the retina. These
4610280	4617880	rods and cones are stimulated by light impinging upon the retina, and so then there are nerve
4617960	4629000	currents set up into the cortex, and a very, very complicated process ensues in which
4630040	4639160	involves something on the order of 20 or 21 visual centers in the cortex, and libraries have been
4639160	4649720	filled with the product of that research. But the fact of the matter is that
4652120	4662440	when all is said and done, we can just trace the process of seeing, the process of visual perception
4663000	4670440	to a bunch of visual centers in the cortex, none of which actually
4671320	4683720	contains that image that we see. And so it turns out that
4683960	4695880	the so-called retinal image theory of visual perception doesn't really lead to perception.
4696920	4704520	It leads in a sense to the very opposite in the sense that these different visual centers
4705000	4713560	take the image apart, and as Sir Francis Crick said famously, we see how the image,
4713560	4722520	how the brain takes the image apart. We do not yet see how the brain puts the picture back together
4722520	4731080	again, and the obvious fact is that the brain does not put the picture back together again.
4731080	4739800	In fact, it can't. And the fact that it can't has come to be known as a so-called binding problem.
4739800	4750600	The problem is you've got, say, a million neurons in these visual centers of the brain,
4751320	4764120	and as a result of light striking the retina, these are in various modes of on and off position.
4765960	4773800	How do you make a picture out of this vast multiplicity of neuronal states?
4774760	4781400	And in other words, how does the brain put the picture back together again?
4782040	4789080	And the answer quite obviously is the brain can do no such thing. And so this has become known
4789800	4802440	in the world of, this has become known as the binding problem. And the fact of the matter is
4803320	4815400	that the binding problem really has no solution on a neuronal basis. The neurons
4816040	4821880	take the picture apart, they do not, they cannot put it back together again. And so
4822200	4837400	at one point, I simply stated the obvious fact that the binding problem cannot be
4839080	4847800	solved on the corporeal level. In other words, the only way the binding problem can solve,
4848440	4855880	can be solved, the way it is solved, is that in our integral being, we are not
4856440	4863800	subject to the condition of space. In our corporeal nature, yes, on that level,
4864360	4872680	we are subject to the condition of space. And this is where all that neurophysiology takes place.
4872920	4881480	But the actual binding takes place on the next level up, which is the level of the
4883480	4890200	intermediary or psychic plane. So the answer to the binding problem is this,
4891400	4896520	it is resolved not on the corporeal level, but on the psychic.
4896680	4907240	So if we were purely corporeal creatures, we could not see anything. There could be no perception.
4910200	4915320	And incidentally, so we have these three levels of the cosmos, the
4917560	4926120	intelligible, the psychic and the corporeal. And I just want to point out that in days gone by,
4927160	4934440	every child really knew that the human being himself
4936040	4952840	consists of three levels. In Latin, it's anima, soul, psyche, mind, and intellect or spiritus.
4952920	4962040	So corpus anima spiritus, this trichotomy of man, is simply, simply
4963240	4972680	tells us that man is a microcosm. Man is the cosmos in miniature. So even as the cosmos is
4972680	4982600	tripartite, the anthropos is also tripartite. And if we were not tripartite, for example,
4983720	4990600	visual perception would be impossible. And this is what has now baffled
4991320	4999000	the neurophysiologists. This is the binding problem which no one has solved. And no one
4999000	5008440	can solve on the corporeal level. The binding problem would be impossible to solve if it were
5008440	5019320	not for the fact that man is more than a body. Man has not only a body, he has also a soul.
5019880	5027480	And then there's the third component, above soul there is spiritus. And we need all three,
5029240	5035720	actually it turns out, excuse me, it turns out that in addition to the intermediary,
5036600	5046840	the eternal level in man is also needed for ordinary perception, because there could be no
5046840	5053240	perception of motion. If you think about it deeply, the perception of motion
5054040	5060200	is possible only because within man there is a level above time itself.
5065640	5072200	So if we were completely immersed in time, we could not perceive motion.
5072360	5080920	And this is what Gibson discovered, didn't he, is that perception didn't take place as a series of
5080920	5089480	points in time, but was required constant motion and was instantaneous. Yes. The point about Gibson
5089480	5097080	is that he was all empiricists. He was one of the greatest empiricists, I think the world has ever
5097080	5106520	seen, but he was not a metaphysician. And when you read his papers, he expresses himself
5107400	5115720	in purely empiricist terms. He won't talk to you about, he doesn't write about
5116520	5127240	matter and form or a psychic realm subject to time and not to space. This is not the language he
5127240	5140760	uses. He was an empiricist of absolutely first rank. I'm very happy that he has been recognized and
5140760	5149080	acknowledged. I think the academic community has honored him and made him a member of the
5150040	5157080	Academy of Science and so on. They have greatly honored him. And I think they have done so
5157960	5165160	because they have not recognized how dangerous he is to everything that they stand for.
5165960	5173240	Because if they would really understand Gibson, they would realize, to quote my friend Alexander
5173240	5184440	Unziger, they would realize that for 30 years they've been talking nonsense. Because he destroyed
5185000	5203000	that materialist ontology, which underlies our academic sciences as the assumption that nobody
5203000	5210440	really wants to talk about. You assume it, it is not talked about. I think this is a good place to
5210440	5217160	end it here. Well, unless you want to go on. I mean, I don't want to text you too much.
5219560	5230360	As you know, from reading this latest book of mine, I have still many things, basic things to say,
5231000	5240360	but I'm happy to end at any point that you, I still have some energy left in me.
5241960	5248200	If you can go, we'll just go on. I just, I want to be considerate here. Because
5249800	5257720	then we just will go on a little bit. We'll see how far we can go. The reason I asked for Gibson,
5257720	5263560	for your explanation of Gibson's argument, because I wasn't necessarily familiar with it,
5263560	5270520	is we also had on Donald Hoffman, and he's a mathematician, and he said, well, he said the
5270520	5281160	opposite. But now that I heard your argument, I'm not sure if that's just, I'm not sure if it's
5281160	5286760	just semantics or not, because his argument was that we almost certainly do not see reality
5287320	5296520	as it is. But that argument was based on evolution. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Donald Hoffman.
5298120	5307880	Well, let me tell you quite frankly, that I'm not familiar with most of the contemporary
5308520	5315960	thinkers who have made a name for themselves, because as you can see from what has already
5315960	5328120	transpired in our conversation, I stand really on the opposite pole of the contemporary worldview.
5328760	5344520	I'm a Platonist. I've always been a Platonist. And the older I get, the more deeply I value
5344520	5357320	Plato. And the more instinctively I look upon our issues from a Platonist point of view. And this
5357320	5370920	point of view is quite evidently the very opposite of the modern or contemporary way of looking at
5370920	5382440	things. The contemporary way of looking at things is basically Democratian. From a Platonist point
5382440	5392440	of view, we're repeating the Democratian heresy. And in a way, priding ourselves on that.
5393880	5399800	The point being that we are trying to understand
5402600	5410440	complex things, corporeal things and mental things, except being something
5410440	5419960	supramental, that too, we're trying to understand everything on the basis of atoms and the void.
5419960	5428680	In other words, in modern terms, this would be quantum particles. And I think it already emerges
5428680	5441560	from what we have been talking about this morning, that you do not understand anything ontologically
5442440	5451400	if you imagine that things reduce the quantum particles. Because in point of fact, quantum
5451400	5458440	particles have no being. They're not really there. They are near potences. And obviously,
5458440	5471880	the universe is not a potency, but an actuality. So from my Platonist point of view, contemporary
5472200	5484520	thought regarding the nature of cosmic reality is upside down. We are standing upside down. We
5484520	5493960	are trying to understand actuality in terms of potency. And it's a hopeless process.
5494200	5503320	And so I have read comparatively few contemporary authors. And the only
5503320	5511480	contemporary authors that I've really read with great interest, like, for example, James Gibson,
5512040	5522840	is due to the fact that he opposes the contemporary point of view. Gibson interests me so enormously.
5523800	5529320	Because he says the opposite of most other cognitive psychologists.
5531160	5537880	Wolfgang, what could you say specifically that Gibson discovered about perception, meaning
5538440	5544520	what was it about the nature of perception that was so distinct from the retinal image version?
5545480	5554680	Well, he discovered something that practically no one in the contemporary scientific world
5555720	5564680	was prepared to believe. Namely, that what we see in visual perception is not inside the head,
5564680	5575320	it's outside. We actually perceive a mountain or a rose. If the rose is red, we actually perceive
5575320	5583720	that redness in the rose. This is what, of course, the ancients believed. This was in Plato's day,
5584680	5592840	everyone would have agreed. But it goes completely contrary to everything that the
5593800	5601240	Western intelligentsia has believed since the days of René Descartes. And so
5604040	5611320	it comes as an enormous shock, or should come as an enormous shock to the educated world of our day,
5611880	5620280	that someone like Gibson has made these discoveries, and in a way which cannot really be refuted.
5620840	5628280	You introduced René Descartes, and one of the topics that you like to talk about is the notion
5628280	5635240	of bifurcation, which was a term coined by Alfred North Whitehead to describe Descartes' bifurcated
5635240	5641560	world between thought and extension. And I have a feeling that that plays a role in, let's say,
5642200	5651160	Professor Hoffman's conception of perceiving the world as conjecture in our mind as opposed to the
5651160	5663960	world as it is. Yeah, I'm glad, Brian, that you brought up the idea of bifurcation, because it is
5663960	5678120	really very, very basic. Descartes introduced it in the 17th century, and it is simply the postulate
5679080	5693560	that the world, the realm of existing things splits into two categories. There is the first
5693560	5703080	category is what he calls res extensé, which means extended entities. And these are entities which
5703080	5721080	exist in space, and they have no other attributes than the fact that they exist in space and time.
5722040	5735720	Everything that is not a res extensor is what Descartes calls a res cogitans, which means a thing of
5735720	5746040	the mind. So having split the entire universe into extended entities on one side and mental entities
5746040	5758520	on the other, he has set the world up, ideally for the mathematical physicists, because it tells
5758520	5765640	the mathematical physicists that the real world, the world that exists outside and not inside the head,
5766600	5776040	consists of only extended entities. So this suggested to Sir Isaac Newton and to physicists
5776040	5784120	really ever after, that the real world is precisely the world as the physicists concede of it.
5786520	5792040	These are the things that can be described in mathematical terms.
5792760	5802360	It began in a crude way with mechanisms that are somewhat like a clockwork. And you remember
5802360	5809800	in the 17th century, in fact, they built these mechanisms. You see them in Venice.
5814200	5820200	And they built them because they really thought that that's what the real world is like. It's a
5820200	5831800	world of cogs and wheels interacting mechanically. And so the physicists were delighted because Descartes
5832360	5843800	left them with an exterior so-called external world of the kind that really is made for
5843800	5852840	mathematical analysis. It's ideal. The physicist was in his paradise. And however,
5855880	5869800	it turns out that by reducing the external world to res extensé, making out of it a kind of clockwork
5869800	5886040	universe, Descartes misrepresented the external world. He oversimplified it. And we have been
5886040	5895720	paying the price ever since. Now, this Cartesian dichotomy into res extensé and res cogitantes
5896600	5903800	has become, so to speak, second nature among physicists.
5905880	5915720	Every physicist learns this bifurcationist outlook very early in life. And then he
5915720	5928600	learns it so deeply and so naturally that he doesn't recognize it as a postulate.
5930600	5941080	Most physicists, it turns out, are really incapable of grasping bifurcation as a philosophical
5941160	5948200	axiom, an assumption which may or may not be true. And so it was Alfred North Whitehead
5948760	5957080	who coined that term bifurcation. And then he went to all the finest universities in
5958600	5968840	the UK and in the States, lecturing physicists about this assumption that unwittingly they
5968840	5976200	have made. And he pointed out to them that it has created an incredible model.
5977880	5984680	And in the hope of waking them up as it were, but the fact of the matter is that
5986440	5993320	it's uncertain whether there exists even one famous physicist who is not
5994040	6005160	instinctively bifurcationist. So bifurcation is then a metaphysical axiom which physicists
6005160	6014920	almost without exception or perhaps actually without exception believe in. Now, the important
6014920	6025640	thing is that bifurcation is ultimately untenable. It is not true. It is a metaphysical error.
6026600	6032920	And in a sense, we know that since the days of Democritus, because in a sense,
6033880	6043800	Democritus is the first philosopher in history to introduce bifurcation into the
6046600	6058120	into philosophical discourse. So the upshot of the matter is that physics,
6058920	6070840	as it is understood in our day, is bound up with this axiom of bifurcation, which it assumes
6073800	6083880	rigidly. And once you have assumed that axiom, you are committed to a kind of crude materialism,
6084440	6093240	which cannot possibly be true. It's an error that invalidates your wealth and show.
6095960	6102200	In fact, Heisenberg spoke about it as well, didn't he? He wrote about it. I had a quote here,
6102200	6108760	and he wrote, if one follows with great difficulty, which even eminent scientists like
6108760	6113720	Einstein have an understanding in accepting the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory
6113720	6119080	one can trace the roots of that difficulty to the Cartesian partition. And he goes on to say
6119080	6124200	that this partition has penetrated deeply into the human mind during the three centuries following
6124200	6129000	Descartes, and it will take a long time for it to be replaced by a really different attitude
6129000	6133160	toward the reality problem. That was from Heisenberg, which might come as a surprise to me.
6135160	6142920	The interesting thing about Heisenberg is that here and there in his writings,
6142920	6153480	you will find passages like the one that you just read. But I've made a rather thorough study of
6153480	6159320	Heisenberg because I regard him as among all the physicists, he was the most enlightened
6159960	6169000	metaphysically far more than anyone else that I can name. But the fact of the matter is that
6169720	6179640	there are other passages, you can quote in the writings of Werner Heisenberg,
6180440	6189960	where he is in fact placing himself on a bifurcationist basis. So he was not completely,
6190680	6201560	he was far more enlightened metaphysically than any other well-known physicist of our time.
6205800	6213800	And I say this is due to the fact that he was a son of a classicist. Through his father, he came to
6213800	6225640	know Platonism and philosophy of Aristotle and so forth. But he was not altogether consistent.
6226360	6231480	And I think if he had
6235960	6248280	comprehended non-bifurcation more deeply, he would have resolved the
6248600	6258520	leading problems in the philosophy of physics, which he did not actually resolve.
6259880	6269640	He gives us clues, occasionally very perceptive clues, but he did not carry through to solve.
6269640	6275160	For example, he did not give us a solution of the measurement problem.
6277560	6288920	The so-called Copenhagen rule, which he and Niels Bohr proposed, was a way, gave us a way of doing
6288920	6299480	physics without getting into trouble. But the reason for the Copenhagen cut is something
6299480	6310920	that he never articulated explicitly, which he could have based upon the recognition that bifurcation
6310920	6323960	is false. I have a question from the audience. When I read your book, you seem to have a lot of
6324280	6329480	quote from Unsikker. Unsikker, I'm not sure how you pronounce it. How do you pronounce it?
6329480	6338920	Unsikker. Unsikker. Okay. And Ben Moffo asks, what does Dr. Smith think of Unsikker's variable
6338920	6349080	light speed theory? Well, Unsikker is a great admirer of Albert Einstein. In fact, in his
6349640	6359640	recent book, just published a short while ago, he goes into the Einsteinian physics in a very
6359640	6369960	interesting way. And it clearly reveals that he regards Einsteinian physics as the key to a deeper
6369960	6378360	understanding of the subject. And so on this point, Alexander Unsikker and I are completely on
6378360	6386600	opposite sides of the issue. I regard Einsteinian physics as fundamentally misconceived.
6389240	6400760	The reason that this is not universally known or accepted resides in the fact that
6401160	6415320	Einsteinian physics differs from classical physics, mathematically, by a square root for one minus
6415320	6424200	v squared over c squared, where b is the velocity of the system of the object that you are speaking
6424200	6434120	about. And c is the velocity of light. Now, since the speed of light is about 300,000 kilometers per
6434120	6445320	second, one minus v squared over c squared is so incredibly close to one, unless you get up to speeds
6445960	6452760	which approach the speed of light, which is very hard to do in an empirical setting.
6454280	6464760	So on account of this fact, the deviation between Einsteinian physics and non-Einsteinian physics
6465560	6476360	is so small as to be practically unmeasurable. There is one, what is regarded as an Einsteinian
6476360	6487720	formula, which is not covered by this observation. And that is a formula E equals mc squared,
6488360	6499880	called the atom bomb formula. Now, it is true that Einstein derived this formula from his 1905
6499880	6511000	paper. What is generally unknown, even among physicists, is the fact that the formula E equals
6511000	6519560	mc squared can also be derived from classical physics. In a word, it has nothing to do with
6519560	6529800	relativity. And this is one of the reasons why Einsteinian physics has been just about
6529800	6541080	universally accepted, is because if you regard E for mc squared to be a relativistic formula,
6541560	6547880	well, that certainly and unfortunately has proved itself to be absolutely correct.
6548760	6551560	So what I'm saying is that
6554680	6567560	Einsteinian physics has not really passed the empirical test. People think it has, but
6567880	6575480	if you actually go into the details, about 50 different experiments that can be listed,
6575480	6583960	which were designed to test relativistic effects, not one of them really stands up,
6583960	6594760	understood the name. And the exception, the parent exception, the E equals mc squared formula,
6595720	6603000	that does stand up on the scrutiny, but it has nothing to do with relativity theory at all.
6603720	6616520	It can equally well be derived from classical physics. So therefore, I believe that our present
6616520	6625080	addiction, if you will, to Einsteinian physics is misconceived. And I think the time will come,
6625880	6634120	perhaps very soon, when this will come to light, and Einstein will be discredited.
6635960	6642440	Right. But this person was asking about variable light speed, or at least the variable light speed
6642760	6649480	theory. I'm not acquainted with the theory, but I'm imagining that light can go different speeds,
6649480	6652040	and that would probably solve some problems.
6655160	6669720	Yes, I'm not an expert on these things at all. I have done some inquiry into Einsteinian physics,
6669720	6677240	because for various reasons, this has interested me a lot. And I did, as I have just indicated,
6677240	6691160	come to the conclusion that the theory has been accepted on spurious grounds, that a lot of
6691160	6700520	ideology enters into it. It's a very complicated story. I would love to read a book,
6701400	6707960	which has not yet been written, which, so to speak, gives the inside story of what stands behind
6707960	6713720	Einsteinian physics and that fascination, that love affair, if you will, that we've had with
6713720	6721400	Einsteinian physics. I'd be very interested to know more about that. All I know is that
6722120	6733720	there has been a lot of misconception on this subject, and in particular, I do disagree with
6733720	6741880	Alexander Unziger on this point. Fair enough. I don't have, it's not a question, but a statement
6741880	6748440	someone made. Could be me, he said, many of the comments Dr. Smith has made and his attention to
6748440	6755720	Plato seems to align with ideas we hear from John Furveki. Well, could be me, there is a,
6755720	6762280	as far as Dr. Smith has done an interview with John Furveki, at least one, I think, right?
6762280	6767880	I've had two conversations with him, yeah. Well, there you go. So, if you're listening,
6768840	6773880	check it out. They're probably very, very good. John Furveki is an excellent speaker,
6774440	6781160	very creative mind. I love the dear doctor. Very pleased when I saw that one. I was like,
6781160	6785240	okay, there's got to be some interesting things in there. Yeah.
6787880	6797160	Yes, he's a very, very erudite man and a very deep thinker. And I think what I admire most
6798040	6806760	is truly a seeker of truth. Truth is important to him. Not for any ulterior motive, but
6807560	6812200	it is important because it should be important. What is more important than truth?
6817560	6822680	Should we end it here? This way has been, we have been going on for two hours already.
6823480	6829720	And my voice is, I've actually been sick as a dog and I'm trying not to cough.
6830440	6835240	And what is acting up right now? So, I think for my own sake, I have to stop this time.
6836360	6844520	Well, I thank you so much, Jack, for this interview. I'm very happy to have had an
6844520	6851400	opportunity to discuss these matters because I think they are very, very important.
6853640	6864600	Important in a very broad sense. I think our civilization is, has been under the influence
6865400	6875240	of certain materialist conceptions which prove not to be true. And I think it is very,
6875320	6884360	very important that these things be rectified. And I think your program is doing a lot of good in
6884360	6892120	the sense that it is helping to bring clarity into these issues. All right, thank you. I really hope
6892120	6903720	so. And thank you so much for having the stamina to talk for two hours. Brian, thank you for joining
6903720	6912600	us for helping me. Anybody who is listening, thank you too for your comments and for listening.
6913720	6919480	I wish you all a very good night and I will see you guys the next time. Good night.
6921240	6929400	Thank you and alles Gute. Thanks, Jack. And Jack, if you ever go to visit Wolfgang, you can,
6930200	6933640	you better have more stamina than that because he'll go to three in the morning.
6934120	6941240	Oh, that's good to know. I did not expect this. I did not expect this, honestly. Okay, guys.
6941240	6948120	It was a good conversation. Good night. Good night. Good night. Thank you so much.
