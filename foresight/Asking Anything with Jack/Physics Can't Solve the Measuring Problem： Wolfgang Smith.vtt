WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
So today with us is Wolfgang Smith.

00:03.440 --> 00:09.280
He has majors in physics, mathematics, and philosophy.

00:09.280 --> 00:11.320
He contributed a theoretical solution

00:11.320 --> 00:13.680
to the reentry problem for spaceflight

00:13.680 --> 00:16.000
during his work as an aerodynamicist.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.520
He has a doctorate in mathematics

00:17.520 --> 00:19.160
and pursued a career as a mathematician

00:19.160 --> 00:22.320
until his retirement in 1992.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.560
He devoted himself to the publication of books,

00:24.560 --> 00:26.920
mission to correct the fallacies of contemporary

00:27.880 --> 00:30.360
scientific belief, by the way, of insights derived

00:30.360 --> 00:32.960
from the perennial wisdom of mankind.

00:32.960 --> 00:36.440
These works focus primarily on foundational problems

00:36.440 --> 00:39.600
in quantum theory and the problems of visual perception.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.840
Welcome, Wolfgang.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.000
Well, thank you.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.120
Glad to be here.

00:46.120 --> 00:47.720
Very, very glad you're here.

00:47.720 --> 00:49.120
Very excited.

00:49.120 --> 00:51.440
With us also today is Brian Murphy.

00:51.440 --> 00:54.320
Now, Brian, could you please introduce yourself

00:54.320 --> 00:57.200
while you're here?

00:57.200 --> 00:57.720
Hi, Jack.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.920
Thank you and hello to your audience.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.600
I'll make my comments brief, and then

01:01.600 --> 01:03.280
I'll turn it back to you and Wolfgang,

01:03.280 --> 01:06.320
because that's really where the money is in this conversation.

01:06.320 --> 01:09.920
And I came to know Wolfgang after seeing the documentary

01:09.920 --> 01:13.320
about him called The End of Quantum Reality.

01:13.320 --> 01:15.400
And after that, I ordered one of his books.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.880
In that case, it was Science and Myth

01:17.880 --> 01:21.320
with a response to Stephen Hawking's The Grand Design.

01:21.320 --> 01:23.480
And after reading that book, I reached out

01:23.480 --> 01:25.760
to the producer of the documentary on Facebook.

01:25.760 --> 01:28.080
And I asked him if he had thought about creating

01:28.080 --> 01:31.080
an educational initiative in the foundation.

01:31.080 --> 01:33.400
And that led to a conversation and introduction

01:33.400 --> 01:36.280
to Wolfgang and a friendship that has developed

01:36.280 --> 01:37.520
over the past three years.

01:37.520 --> 01:40.320
So we're now developing educational outreach

01:40.320 --> 01:42.720
and hopefully a lecture series under the banner

01:42.720 --> 01:44.240
of Project Scola.

01:44.240 --> 01:47.600
And we have a number of prominent and highly skilled

01:47.600 --> 01:49.840
and educated scholars from around the world who

01:49.840 --> 01:52.680
are committed to this endeavor.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.640
And so I have to say, when I read that book,

01:54.640 --> 01:56.440
and I mean in the first chapter of that book,

01:56.440 --> 01:58.840
the entire edifice of the worldview

01:58.840 --> 02:01.600
that I had imbibed over the many years

02:01.600 --> 02:03.680
just sort of melted into oblivion.

02:03.680 --> 02:06.680
And I think we're all familiar with that worldview.

02:06.680 --> 02:09.720
It's the one that purports to be scientific.

02:09.720 --> 02:12.440
It generally comes from PhDs who tell us

02:12.440 --> 02:15.760
we're sums of parts or composed of atoms or particles

02:15.760 --> 02:18.720
speeding through space and time to no purpose.

02:18.720 --> 02:21.600
And some might even say we have no free will

02:21.720 --> 02:23.760
or that our actions and decisions

02:23.760 --> 02:26.960
are determined in advance by these forces of physics.

02:26.960 --> 02:29.560
And so, but I'm like one of your audience members.

02:29.560 --> 02:30.440
I'm a lay person.

02:30.440 --> 02:31.640
I don't have a PhD.

02:31.640 --> 02:33.000
I'm not a physicist.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.440
But I'm very interested in this topic

02:34.440 --> 02:37.600
because I think it goes to the very heart of reality.

02:37.600 --> 02:40.280
It goes to the very heart of what it means to be human.

02:40.280 --> 02:42.160
And so in Wolfgang's latest book,

02:42.160 --> 02:44.240
Physics, A Science and Quest of Ontology,

02:44.240 --> 02:46.000
which you're gonna talk to him about,

02:46.000 --> 02:48.800
Wolfgang really offers a new cosmology,

02:48.800 --> 02:50.600
which is really an ancient cosmology.

02:50.600 --> 02:53.960
And I think it'll really open people's eyes

02:53.960 --> 02:55.600
to things they haven't heard before

02:55.600 --> 02:56.880
or maybe haven't heard in decades.

02:56.880 --> 02:59.520
So the bottom line is what I want your audience to know

02:59.520 --> 03:03.160
is that Wolfgang Smith is not just another guy

03:03.160 --> 03:05.720
with some interesting ideas among many.

03:05.720 --> 03:09.640
No, I really feel there's no one like Wolfgang Smith.

03:09.640 --> 03:13.520
And he has resolved the quantum reality problem,

03:13.520 --> 03:14.880
the measurement problem.

03:14.880 --> 03:17.840
And what he shows with amazing simplicity

03:17.840 --> 03:22.240
is that our world is full of irreducible holes

03:22.240 --> 03:24.560
of beings imbued with qualities

03:24.560 --> 03:26.160
that transcend the world of physics.

03:26.160 --> 03:30.120
And so like Plato's analogy of the cave,

03:30.120 --> 03:33.200
he invites his readers and he invites listeners

03:33.200 --> 03:35.320
to make that ascent out of the cave.

03:35.320 --> 03:38.160
So I would invite you to listen to this man

03:38.160 --> 03:40.400
and become a member of his foundation,

03:40.400 --> 03:41.840
the Philosophia Initiative.

03:41.840 --> 03:44.040
And with that, I'll turn it back to you too.

03:45.040 --> 03:45.960
Thank you.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.280
That was a great introduction.

03:47.280 --> 03:48.760
Thank you.

03:48.760 --> 03:51.240
Probably much better than I would have done.

03:51.240 --> 03:56.400
Now, as I said just before we were in life,

03:56.400 --> 03:58.280
Wolfgang kind of flew under the radar for me.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.760
It kind of surprised me.

03:59.760 --> 04:04.600
I got an email from his publicist and I had to check him out.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.520
And they sent me a book.

04:06.520 --> 04:11.320
This is Physics Assigned in Quest of Nontology.

04:11.320 --> 04:13.760
And it was actually much more interesting

04:13.760 --> 04:15.880
than I initially expected, Wolfgang.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.840
You have a beautiful way of writing, honestly.

04:18.840 --> 04:20.600
But I'm not bad.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.120
But you also take no prisoners.

04:22.120 --> 04:25.560
And I kind of like that.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.320
Let me give you one example here.

04:27.320 --> 04:29.320
And you said, I came upon the words,

04:29.320 --> 04:32.080
there is no way to convince an expert that he or she has

04:32.080 --> 04:34.400
done nonsense for 30 years.

04:34.400 --> 04:38.120
I realized instantly that this person has something to say.

04:38.120 --> 04:40.400
When I read that, I instantly realized

04:40.400 --> 04:42.480
that Wolfgang has something to say to.

04:42.480 --> 04:50.600
So it was kind of tongue-in-cheek, but I like it.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.880
Well, the people who are listening right now

04:53.880 --> 05:01.160
are from the idealist space, metaphysical idealism.

05:01.160 --> 05:07.520
So we're already not really convinced of scientism.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.880
But it doesn't mean that we have to talk about idealism.

05:09.880 --> 05:12.240
But there's this little thing about,

05:12.240 --> 05:15.320
I haven't read, I haven't come across this in this book.

05:15.320 --> 05:17.640
So before we start, I'm actually kind of curious.

05:17.640 --> 05:22.080
Just what are your thoughts on just consciousness?

05:22.080 --> 05:23.720
I haven't seen the word in this book.

05:23.720 --> 05:26.920
Maybe if you wrote about it, maybe you haven't.

05:26.920 --> 05:30.760
But physicists have a lot to say about consciousness.

05:30.760 --> 05:33.840
And idealists have a lot to say about consciousness.

05:33.840 --> 05:37.120
But I haven't heard Wolfgang say anything about consciousness.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.520
Is there anything you'd like to personally

05:39.520 --> 05:44.160
or professionally say about that topic?

05:44.160 --> 05:49.160
Well, I think the topic of consciousness

05:49.160 --> 05:54.520
is obviously very central, very major.

05:54.520 --> 05:58.960
And what I have to say about it, I think,

05:58.960 --> 06:06.320
can best be described as being the very opposite of what

06:06.320 --> 06:14.920
is nowadays involved regarding the subject of consciousness.

06:14.920 --> 06:25.480
Because I am persuaded that instead of coming somehow

06:25.480 --> 06:32.920
up from the bottom by some process of evolution,

06:32.920 --> 06:37.080
consciousness is ultimately, in the final count,

06:37.080 --> 06:41.280
what used to be called a Norman day.

06:41.280 --> 06:46.520
It is actually rooted in divinity itself.

06:46.520 --> 06:51.680
And by way of explication, let me mention

06:51.680 --> 06:58.400
that the oldest tradition, intellectual tradition

06:58.400 --> 07:02.040
in the world unquestionably is a Vedic.

07:02.040 --> 07:05.920
And in the Vedic tradition, consciousness

07:05.920 --> 07:08.840
is indeed a Norman day.

07:08.840 --> 07:16.400
And it is part of the Sanskrit word satchitananda.

07:16.400 --> 07:23.400
So satchitananda, these are three words put into one.

07:23.400 --> 07:26.560
Sat means being.

07:26.560 --> 07:29.920
Chit means consciousness.

07:29.920 --> 07:33.400
And ananda means bliss.

07:33.400 --> 07:40.120
So being consciousness and bliss are, so to speak,

07:40.120 --> 07:44.160
the three aspects or faces, if you will,

07:44.160 --> 07:48.320
of the divinity, the very, very first principle.

07:48.320 --> 07:55.160
And I honestly believe that there is no other way

07:55.160 --> 07:58.120
of really understanding consciousness.

07:58.120 --> 08:00.000
It's not an epiphenomenon.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.960
It has nothing whatsoever to do with neurons.

08:04.960 --> 08:09.960
And in fact, it is rooted in the very, very first principle

08:09.960 --> 08:11.720
of all, which is God.

08:14.360 --> 08:21.760
So I think these remarks may suffice

08:21.760 --> 08:27.920
to show that my thinking is really very far removed

08:27.920 --> 08:32.400
from the contemporary, because the contemporary thinking

08:32.400 --> 08:36.680
is characterized by the fact that almost instinctively,

08:36.680 --> 08:42.440
contemporary Western man wants to understand everything

08:42.440 --> 08:48.560
from the bottom, which he conceives more or less

08:48.560 --> 08:52.880
in terms of quantum mechanics.

08:52.880 --> 08:59.280
And this is, to me, the epitome of error.

08:59.280 --> 09:04.000
And in fact, I would justify this claim

09:04.000 --> 09:12.600
by pointing out that the contemporary metaphysics is

09:12.600 --> 09:17.200
really nothing new, but it is a revival

09:17.240 --> 09:23.360
of the philosophy of Democritus, who famously

09:23.360 --> 09:37.600
said the Golger believed in qualities, color,

09:37.600 --> 09:40.320
the sweet and the bitter.

09:40.320 --> 09:45.920
But in reality, there is only atoms and the void.

09:45.960 --> 09:54.440
So this is basically not only one

09:54.440 --> 09:58.560
of the oldest philosophical positions of mankind,

09:58.560 --> 10:03.520
but it has been revived in the 17th century,

10:03.520 --> 10:08.520
and it has become our modern cradle.

10:08.520 --> 10:14.480
And let me mention that very soon after Democritus

10:14.480 --> 10:21.200
propounded his theory concerning atoms and the void,

10:21.200 --> 10:29.840
Plato attacked it, and I believe rigorously disqualified

10:29.840 --> 10:33.440
this position once and for all.

10:33.440 --> 10:37.960
And so for 2,000 years thereafter,

10:37.960 --> 10:45.800
the well-informed regarded this atomistic metaphysics

10:45.800 --> 10:47.760
as a heresy.

10:47.760 --> 10:52.080
And so what happened in the 17th century

10:52.080 --> 10:58.640
under the aegis of people like Descartes and Galileo,

10:58.640 --> 11:05.880
that ancient heresy was revived and became

11:05.880 --> 11:12.320
the foundation of what we nowadays call the Enlightenment.

11:12.320 --> 11:21.720
So this is, so to speak, the historical overview of where

11:21.720 --> 11:25.400
we find ourselves today.

11:25.400 --> 11:31.920
And needless to say, I have been an opponent

11:31.920 --> 11:40.720
of the current Weltanschauung since the age of 14, really.

11:40.720 --> 11:43.800
Really, what happened when you were 14?

11:43.800 --> 11:46.680
That made that happen?

11:46.680 --> 11:51.960
Well, I think the decisive event was that somehow or other,

11:51.960 --> 11:56.600
I came across a very important book,

11:56.600 --> 12:02.160
a book by Alfred North Whitehead entitled

12:02.160 --> 12:05.520
Science in the Modern World.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.920
I read this book with great interest.

12:07.920 --> 12:15.040
I don't think I understood that much because I was very young.

12:15.040 --> 12:23.800
But I understood enough to be fascinated and, in a sense,

12:23.800 --> 12:30.720
to be devoted to these questions for the rest of my life.

12:34.200 --> 12:41.960
So Whitehead, as it were, awakened my philosophical interest

12:41.960 --> 12:47.000
and instincts, if you will, instinctively

12:47.000 --> 12:51.600
when I read about the fallacy of misplaced concreteness

12:51.600 --> 12:55.640
and these things, I realized that this must be true.

12:58.200 --> 13:05.560
And so this started me on a career which

13:05.560 --> 13:09.000
put me in the position of the outsider

13:09.000 --> 13:13.240
from the very beginning.

13:13.240 --> 13:16.240
I always felt myself as an outsider

13:16.240 --> 13:19.520
in the contemporary Western culture.

13:19.520 --> 13:24.280
And the reason was that I felt myself as an insider

13:24.280 --> 13:30.240
when it comes to the ancient philosophies, primarily

13:30.240 --> 13:32.720
Platonism.

13:32.720 --> 13:37.920
So in Platonism, I felt that I was an insider.

13:37.920 --> 13:39.960
Not that I understood it that well,

13:39.960 --> 13:44.000
but instinctively I was drawn to it.

13:44.080 --> 13:50.440
And something within me assured me

13:50.440 --> 13:53.720
that this must be the truth.

13:53.720 --> 14:00.400
And incidentally, Platonism doesn't stand alone.

14:00.400 --> 14:08.280
It is inherently the same as the Vedic tradition.

14:08.280 --> 14:11.160
There are certain differences.

14:11.160 --> 14:13.600
But in essence, it is the same doctrine.

14:16.160 --> 14:27.760
And as I said, the contemporary Weltanschauung,

14:27.760 --> 14:32.400
which is regards particles of some kind or another

14:32.400 --> 14:38.320
as a very basis from which everything else evolves,

14:38.320 --> 14:47.480
that Weltanschauung is really nothing new at all.

14:47.480 --> 14:50.680
As I said, it goes back to the Democritus.

14:50.680 --> 14:53.720
And you might say it is one of the oldest heresies

14:53.720 --> 14:56.520
in the history of human thought.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.800
You're not a fan of atomistic thinking.

14:58.800 --> 15:02.880
That's certainly what I got it from reading your book.

15:02.880 --> 15:09.080
And you even go as far as to say that there are no,

15:09.080 --> 15:10.560
that particles do not exist.

15:14.840 --> 15:23.280
Yes, when you really pursue the Platonist metaphysics

15:23.280 --> 15:32.440
and apply it to the contemporary panorama of physics

15:32.520 --> 15:35.720
with its division between classical physics and quantum

15:35.720 --> 15:44.200
physics, you find, and this came to me as an amazement,

15:44.200 --> 15:49.880
you find that everything falls into place.

15:49.880 --> 15:53.960
And you can, in fact, understand this division

15:53.960 --> 15:58.760
between classical physics and quantum physics

15:58.760 --> 16:05.080
in a brand new way, which finally makes sense.

16:05.080 --> 16:07.800
I really like you to go deeper into that,

16:07.800 --> 16:12.320
or at least explain your solution to this problem.

16:12.320 --> 16:16.240
So if you can briefly state the problem,

16:16.240 --> 16:17.320
and then your solution.

16:21.560 --> 16:27.480
Yes, let me just say by way of introduction

16:27.480 --> 16:33.680
that the Platonist metaphysics is, in a sense,

16:33.680 --> 16:41.400
the diametric opposite of what contemporary intellectuals

16:41.400 --> 16:47.080
believe, because contemporary intellectuals

16:47.080 --> 16:52.440
believe that it all begins with atoms.

16:53.440 --> 17:00.840
Nowadays, this is conceived evidently in quantum mechanical terms,

17:00.840 --> 17:07.240
but metaphysically speaking, it's just atoms and the void,

17:07.240 --> 17:12.840
very much as the democratus conceived of it.

17:12.840 --> 17:18.240
It's the beginning of the fifth century BC.

17:19.240 --> 17:25.520
So in a sense, you can say there's nothing new under the sun,

17:25.520 --> 17:31.400
because stripped of its technical aspects,

17:31.400 --> 17:37.280
the contemporary worldview is basically

17:37.280 --> 17:40.160
democratus all over again.

17:40.200 --> 17:49.800
And it is as much a heresy today as it was in the early days

17:49.800 --> 17:51.640
of democratus.

17:51.640 --> 17:57.200
In other words, it is simply false to say

17:57.200 --> 18:03.760
that everything arises from particles.

18:03.760 --> 18:08.800
There's no evidence to that effect.

18:08.800 --> 18:12.600
People may think so, but if you dig into it a little bit more

18:12.600 --> 18:20.160
deeply, you find that all these purported scenarios really

18:20.160 --> 18:23.560
prove to be baseless.

18:23.560 --> 18:30.600
And if you go into it with any kind of mathematical depths,

18:30.600 --> 18:37.800
you find quickly enough that this contemporary scenario, which

18:37.800 --> 18:44.440
tries to reduce everything to aggregates of particles,

18:44.440 --> 18:48.280
actually proves to be impossible.

18:48.280 --> 18:53.400
And in fact, it may interest many people

18:53.400 --> 19:02.200
to know that starting in the year 1998,

19:02.200 --> 19:07.160
this philosophy, this Belt and Schoen,

19:07.160 --> 19:09.680
has really been disproved.

19:09.680 --> 19:14.240
It turns out to be mathematically impossible.

19:14.240 --> 19:19.240
And it is very simple.

19:19.240 --> 19:22.320
I think I can explain that in a few words,

19:22.320 --> 19:25.640
comprehensible to the non-specialists.

19:25.640 --> 19:40.280
If you start out with particles, then you need to talk about evolution.

19:40.280 --> 19:45.440
You need to introduce this term, because somehow these particles

19:45.440 --> 19:49.320
have to give rise to all that there is,

19:49.320 --> 20:01.760
beginning with the planetary system and the simplest organic structures.

20:01.760 --> 20:07.560
So everything has to arise by way of quote unquote evolution.

20:07.560 --> 20:13.120
This is the given, because obviously we live not in a world of particles,

20:13.120 --> 20:21.520
but in a world of something which may conceivably reduce

20:21.520 --> 20:29.600
an aggregate of particles, but it certainly is not what appears to us.

20:29.600 --> 20:39.840
So what I'm trying to say is that if you base yourself on an ontology

20:39.840 --> 20:46.400
of particles, then evolution is an absolute necessity

20:46.400 --> 20:52.360
to go from these particles to the world which we inhabit.

20:52.360 --> 20:56.160
Because the world which we inhabit is more than some of its parts.

20:56.160 --> 21:02.600
It's also one of the things you seem to keep pressing on in this book of yours,

21:02.600 --> 21:08.200
that there is an irreducible hole that you cannot take apart,

21:08.240 --> 21:14.160
you cannot atomize it, and this is also one of the things you stress.

21:14.160 --> 21:23.480
Yes, yes, I do stress this, but the point, Jack, is that

21:23.480 --> 21:29.880
according to the contemporary scientific mindset,

21:29.880 --> 21:34.280
everything does reduce to a sum of parts.

21:34.320 --> 21:38.520
This is what our Weltanschauung insists upon.

21:38.520 --> 21:44.000
Physics by its very modus operandi assumes this much.

21:44.000 --> 21:49.920
The only reason physics can understand an object, whatever it may be,

21:49.920 --> 21:56.600
is that object is a sum of parts, because that's how physics operates.

21:56.600 --> 22:00.520
That's where differential equations come into the picture.

22:00.520 --> 22:09.680
So our contemporary science is predicated upon this assumption

22:09.680 --> 22:16.840
that the world consists of sums of parts.

22:16.840 --> 22:23.880
And now I wanted to point out that it turns out,

22:23.880 --> 22:30.120
and incidentally that's another way of introducing the idea of evolution.

22:30.120 --> 22:31.840
It's the same thing.

22:31.840 --> 22:39.040
If you start with particles, then the world and everything in it

22:39.040 --> 22:42.200
is a result of evolution.

22:42.200 --> 22:45.520
These parts come together to form holes,

22:45.520 --> 22:52.600
and so you get ever more complicated aggregates of particles.

22:52.600 --> 22:58.520
And this is the explanation of the world in which we find ourselves.

22:58.520 --> 23:09.480
But it turns out that this basic premise is untenable.

23:09.480 --> 23:17.240
And that is a direct consequence

23:17.240 --> 23:21.760
over a rigorous mathematical theorem

23:21.760 --> 23:32.560
proved in the year 1998 by an American mathematician named William Demsky.

23:32.560 --> 23:38.080
And what Demsky proved is really very, very simple,

23:38.080 --> 23:44.280
although the proof is not very simple, but the idea is very simple.

23:44.280 --> 23:55.240
Demsky proved that if you have something sufficiently complicated,

23:55.240 --> 24:03.000
then it becomes mathematically impossible to suppose

24:03.000 --> 24:11.880
that this entity came about by chance.

24:11.880 --> 24:21.200
If you have some stochastic random process like tossing a coin,

24:21.200 --> 24:30.760
the likelihood that this will somehow spell out all the volumes

24:30.760 --> 24:35.720
in the Library of Congress in their chronological order

24:35.720 --> 24:41.680
is so small that it is rigorously impossible.

24:41.680 --> 24:50.600
And this is what Demsky proved in this so-called intelligent design theorem,

24:50.600 --> 24:57.800
which was published in a book in Cambridge University Press in 1998.

24:57.800 --> 25:06.640
So what the theorem of Demsky affirms is that

25:06.640 --> 25:13.800
a causality operating in time, which is a causality of physics,

25:13.800 --> 25:21.640
cannot produce what is called complex specified information.

25:21.640 --> 25:26.520
And with this causality, you specifically refer to horizontal causation.

25:26.520 --> 25:29.640
Yes, so horizontal causation.

25:29.640 --> 25:33.760
So when I saw this term for the first time, or this vertical causation,

25:33.760 --> 25:38.080
and I've never heard of it before, immediately I thought,

25:38.080 --> 25:40.080
okay, so what does Wolfgang mean?

25:40.080 --> 25:43.640
Because by that point I had not read your book,

25:43.640 --> 25:49.080
and I can imagine you have on the one hand a cause,

25:49.080 --> 25:52.880
which leads to an effect, and that effect can be another cause.

25:52.880 --> 25:55.760
And we imagine this, at least in the Western world,

25:55.760 --> 25:58.760
because we do not have circular time in our Western thinking.

25:58.760 --> 26:00.560
We have a linear time going,

26:00.560 --> 26:04.320
and it usually is imagined from the left to the right.

26:04.320 --> 26:07.560
So that seems to me the horizontal causation,

26:07.560 --> 26:11.720
but you introduce an idea which is vertical causation,

26:11.720 --> 26:18.480
which might explain some instant annuity.

26:18.480 --> 26:21.960
Sorry, but I just wanted to...

26:21.960 --> 26:24.040
You're absolutely right.

26:24.040 --> 26:29.800
What Demsky's theorem affirms, to put it in my language,

26:29.840 --> 26:32.480
is that horizontal causation,

26:32.480 --> 26:36.280
the causation upon which physics is based,

26:36.280 --> 26:41.680
cannot produce complex specified information.

26:41.680 --> 26:48.000
And since even the simplest forms of life, an amoeba,

26:48.000 --> 26:53.440
as it were, embodies huge quantities

26:53.440 --> 26:57.360
of complex specified information,

26:57.360 --> 27:02.680
it follows from Demsky's theorem that a natural process,

27:02.680 --> 27:05.920
a process that physics can understand,

27:05.920 --> 27:12.160
could not have formed that organic organism, that amoeba.

27:12.160 --> 27:18.640
So the point that I'm making is that, actually,

27:18.640 --> 27:25.600
with Demsky's theorem, evolution, as we normally conceive of it,

27:25.600 --> 27:30.720
has become mathematically impossible.

27:30.720 --> 27:42.720
And the fact that this basic discovery is very much suppressed,

27:42.720 --> 27:52.160
this is not what you will learn at any reputable university.

27:52.160 --> 27:55.920
There are no courses in Harvard or Princeton

27:55.920 --> 27:59.920
that will tell you these things.

27:59.920 --> 28:08.320
It shows that when it comes to Weltanschauung,

28:08.320 --> 28:17.520
the matter is not based on pure simple logic.

28:17.520 --> 28:19.720
I mean, we are human.

28:19.720 --> 28:23.840
Ideology comes into play.

28:23.840 --> 28:34.000
So as a general statement of what I discovered rather early in life,

28:34.000 --> 28:39.960
is that our so-called scientific Weltanschauung,

28:39.960 --> 28:43.440
which entails the idea, for example, of evolution and life

28:43.440 --> 28:48.640
springing from the mental particles, ultimately,

28:48.640 --> 28:55.480
that this is not a scientific fact.

28:55.480 --> 28:57.400
There's no proof of this.

28:57.400 --> 29:02.240
On the contrary, I've just said there are mathematical theorems

29:02.240 --> 29:05.280
that disprove that possibility.

29:05.280 --> 29:11.880
But the point is that our Weltanschauung, which claims to be scientific,

29:11.880 --> 29:21.440
and if you will, objective is, in fact, ideology-driven.

29:21.440 --> 29:23.040
I agree.

29:23.040 --> 29:24.440
Yeah, Brian, go ahead.

29:24.440 --> 29:25.560
I just wanted to add something.

29:25.560 --> 29:28.000
Wolfgang uses the word Weltanschauung, which

29:28.000 --> 29:31.720
is a German word that just means world view

29:31.720 --> 29:33.680
or how one looks out upon the world.

29:33.680 --> 29:37.000
But just going back to your question, Jack,

29:37.000 --> 29:39.080
if I could reintroduce, you had the question

29:39.080 --> 29:42.320
about the Wolfgang's resolution to the quantum enigma.

29:42.320 --> 29:47.880
And Wolfgang, before you came across Dempke's theorem in 1998,

29:47.880 --> 29:50.040
you wrote a book called The Quantum Enigma, Finding

29:50.040 --> 29:56.960
the Hidden Key, in which you pick up on Heisenberg's description

29:56.960 --> 29:59.480
of what quantum reality is.

29:59.480 --> 30:02.000
And this is what leads you down the path to your resolution.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.560
So maybe you could talk about where you picked up from Heisenberg

30:06.560 --> 30:11.520
and how you came to this resolution.

30:11.520 --> 30:12.020
All right.

30:24.600 --> 30:28.200
Quantum theory was discovered in the early decades

30:28.200 --> 30:30.560
of the 20th century.

30:30.560 --> 30:37.400
And very soon after its discovery,

30:37.400 --> 30:45.040
a problem confronted the physicists, which

30:45.040 --> 30:48.520
they were unable to resolve.

30:48.520 --> 30:50.960
And that is the following.

30:50.960 --> 30:55.800
Quantum theory describes a physical system

30:55.800 --> 30:59.400
by a so-called wave function.

30:59.400 --> 31:04.000
And in that wave function description,

31:04.000 --> 31:10.200
the physical systems behave in a very weird way.

31:10.200 --> 31:13.760
Particles, for example, multilocate.

31:13.760 --> 31:21.600
And you are in a realm totally different from the world

31:21.600 --> 31:28.120
as we know it in our daily life.

31:28.120 --> 31:32.920
But when you, for example, set up an experiment

31:32.920 --> 31:40.440
to measure the position of this, say, multi-locating particle,

31:40.440 --> 31:45.160
you find that at the instant of measurement,

31:45.160 --> 31:48.680
the particle ceases to multi-locate

31:48.680 --> 31:56.080
and actually presents itself at some particular location

31:56.080 --> 31:58.920
in space.

31:58.920 --> 32:01.840
And this, of course, is very puzzling.

32:01.840 --> 32:04.920
How does this miracle arise?

32:04.920 --> 32:14.080
That in an instant, a system completely changes

32:14.080 --> 32:20.600
and becomes something that it was not before.

32:20.600 --> 32:24.160
This is called the measurement problem.

32:24.160 --> 32:30.200
And I became very interested in that problem.

32:30.200 --> 32:35.400
It was about 1995, the abouts.

32:35.400 --> 32:44.640
And I finally became convinced that I

32:44.640 --> 32:48.680
see the one and only way to resolve it.

32:48.680 --> 32:53.000
And I wrote a book to that effect on that subject

32:53.000 --> 33:01.480
called the quantum enigma, where I start from the ground up

33:01.480 --> 33:11.480
and develop the idea, ideas, actually two of them,

33:11.480 --> 33:16.480
that are needed to resolve this problem.

33:16.480 --> 33:20.520
And there are two ideas that you need.

33:20.520 --> 33:27.680
The first idea is the fact that the perceptible world, which

33:27.680 --> 33:31.040
is really the world in which we find ourselves,

33:31.040 --> 33:34.880
happens not to be a quantum world.

33:34.880 --> 33:38.400
It happens not to be even just the physical world.

33:38.400 --> 33:42.320
So the world as a physicist conceives of it

33:42.320 --> 33:44.560
is not the full world.

33:44.560 --> 33:45.840
There's more.

33:45.840 --> 33:48.360
And if there were not more, for example,

33:48.360 --> 33:52.960
there could be no perception, there could be no life.

33:52.960 --> 33:58.760
So I made the basic ontological distinction

33:58.760 --> 34:04.280
between a corporeal entity and the physical entity.

34:04.280 --> 34:08.880
Now a corporeal entity is a kind of entity

34:08.880 --> 34:12.720
which we encounter in our normal daily life.

34:13.480 --> 34:18.960
It's something that we perceive as our senses

34:18.960 --> 34:26.720
and something that has a reality, transcending what

34:26.720 --> 34:34.440
the physicist can describe in abstract mathematical terms.

34:34.440 --> 34:40.640
Now every corporeal object X has associated with it

34:40.640 --> 34:44.560
a physical object, call it Sx.

34:44.560 --> 34:48.280
In other words, the physical object

34:48.280 --> 34:56.880
that classical physics deals with are corporeal objects

34:56.880 --> 35:01.280
as conceived by the physicist.

35:01.280 --> 35:05.480
So there's a difference between the corporeal object

35:05.520 --> 35:14.840
X and the object Sx, which is the physicist's conception

35:14.840 --> 35:17.200
of a corporeal object.

35:17.200 --> 35:20.880
I would say that the corporeal object will be not

35:20.880 --> 35:22.560
reducible to each part.

35:22.560 --> 35:27.160
And the physical object S, or at least an abstract object,

35:27.160 --> 35:32.120
will be decomposable into parts the atomistic way.

35:32.160 --> 35:34.160
Yes, you're absolutely right.

35:34.160 --> 35:39.240
Only at this point in the quantum enigma,

35:39.240 --> 35:45.400
I had not yet introduced this idea of irreducible wholeness.

35:45.400 --> 35:50.840
I simply distinguished the object

35:50.840 --> 35:56.800
that we know in daily life through our normal senses

35:56.800 --> 36:00.640
from the corresponding physical object,

36:00.640 --> 36:04.560
which is reduced.

36:04.560 --> 36:08.800
It is limited by the physicist's assumptions.

36:08.800 --> 36:11.480
So you have to distinguish these two objects.

36:11.480 --> 36:12.880
They're not the same.

36:12.880 --> 36:17.360
So there's a distinction between a corporeal object X

36:17.360 --> 36:21.480
and the physicist's concept of that, which

36:21.480 --> 36:24.680
I call the corresponding physical object.

36:24.680 --> 36:27.120
But does its physical object actually exist,

36:27.120 --> 36:29.080
or is it just an abstraction?

36:31.600 --> 36:34.040
The abstraction of the corporeal objects.

36:34.040 --> 36:35.720
It does exist.

36:35.720 --> 36:38.800
I mean, the physicist does not deal with non-entities.

36:38.800 --> 36:40.800
Yes, it has an existence.

36:40.800 --> 36:42.440
The important thing is that you need

36:42.440 --> 36:44.680
to distinguish between the two.

36:44.680 --> 36:46.720
They're not the same thing.

36:46.720 --> 36:50.200
And as long as you don't see that distinction,

36:50.200 --> 36:54.160
you will not be able to solve the measuring problem.

36:54.160 --> 36:57.920
And this is why this measuring problem has been kicked

36:57.920 --> 37:01.800
around by top scientists, top physicists,

37:01.800 --> 37:04.200
for close to 100 years now.

37:04.200 --> 37:11.480
And actually, it has not been solved by these considerations.

37:11.480 --> 37:15.400
Because in fact, it cannot be solved on that basis.

37:15.400 --> 37:18.120
And the reason it cannot be solved on that basis

37:18.120 --> 37:23.360
is that the crux of the matter is this distinction

37:23.400 --> 37:28.320
between the corporeal entity X and the associated physical

37:28.320 --> 37:29.640
entity Sx.

37:29.640 --> 37:32.080
They're not the same.

37:32.080 --> 37:34.480
The corporeal is more.

37:34.480 --> 37:40.000
And it is this more that is the decisive factor

37:40.000 --> 37:44.600
in the measurement problem.

37:44.600 --> 37:47.760
And so I think physicists are still

37:47.760 --> 37:51.280
thinking of the measurement problem.

37:51.320 --> 37:54.360
The fact is that they cannot solve it

37:54.360 --> 37:57.840
on the basis of physics.

37:57.840 --> 38:02.880
So what I showed in this 1995 book, The Quantum Enigma,

38:02.880 --> 38:08.120
is that in a sense, physics is limited.

38:08.120 --> 38:10.600
It doesn't deal with everything.

38:10.600 --> 38:14.640
And it is, in fact, so limited that it

38:14.640 --> 38:20.320
is incapable of recognizing its own limitation.

38:20.320 --> 38:26.360
The fact that the physicist's world is not the entire world,

38:26.360 --> 38:28.400
that's a basic fact.

38:28.400 --> 38:32.720
And unless you understand the basic facts,

38:32.720 --> 38:38.560
you will not be able to correctly understand anything.

38:38.560 --> 38:42.640
But this basic fact is invisible to physics,

38:42.640 --> 38:44.920
by definition, if you will.

38:44.920 --> 38:47.840
Could you say, I was going to ask Wolfgang,

38:47.840 --> 38:53.360
could you say that Sx exists insofar as it participates in X

38:53.360 --> 38:55.120
or partakes of X?

38:55.120 --> 39:01.960
Yes, it derives its being from X.

39:01.960 --> 39:05.520
And this is a major factor.

39:05.520 --> 39:09.920
But this being that the physical object derives

39:09.920 --> 39:15.000
from the corporeal is something entirely invisible

39:15.000 --> 39:17.320
to the physicist.

39:17.320 --> 39:22.880
Because in fact, being as such is invisible to the physicist,

39:22.880 --> 39:26.680
because being is not a sum of parts.

39:26.680 --> 39:33.200
And all the physicists can ever see is sums of parts.

39:33.200 --> 39:36.000
That's why differential equations come into play,

39:36.000 --> 39:42.960
because when you deal with things that do reduce the sum of parts,

39:42.960 --> 39:48.280
these things then are amenable to study

39:48.280 --> 39:52.120
by means of differential equations.

39:52.120 --> 39:55.000
I used to always have trouble with the concept of something

39:55.000 --> 39:57.760
being more than the sum of its parts,

39:57.760 --> 40:02.080
until I heard an example by John Feveki.

40:02.080 --> 40:07.360
He's, I think, a cognitive scientist, not sure.

40:07.360 --> 40:09.840
And he gave the example of the Necker cube,

40:09.880 --> 40:14.280
the two-dimensional drawing of a three-dimensional cube

40:14.280 --> 40:15.640
in a wire frame.

40:15.640 --> 40:19.120
And you can flip that inside and outside.

40:19.120 --> 40:22.560
And he said, well, you have this two-dimensional drawing,

40:22.560 --> 40:24.880
but the three-dimensional projection

40:24.880 --> 40:28.000
you have in your head, that's the thing that is more

40:28.000 --> 40:29.480
than the sum of its parts.

40:29.480 --> 40:33.240
So only until then I kind of understood

40:33.240 --> 40:34.520
what it really meant for something

40:34.520 --> 40:36.360
to be more than the sum of its parts.

40:36.360 --> 40:38.760
It's not something emergent, or there's

40:38.760 --> 40:42.400
something that is not, you can't reduce the three-dimensional

40:42.400 --> 40:45.200
image in your head to the lines on the paper.

40:45.200 --> 40:48.040
And there has to be something more.

40:48.040 --> 40:49.720
Anyway, I just wanted to add that.

40:49.720 --> 40:56.560
Well, this example that John Feveki gave you

40:56.560 --> 40:59.960
is very, very interesting and very fascinating.

40:59.960 --> 41:06.200
But let me point out that it is not necessary to go to something

41:06.200 --> 41:10.880
as high-falutely as this example,

41:10.880 --> 41:16.760
because take, for example, any quality, say, color,

41:16.760 --> 41:19.800
the color red.

41:19.800 --> 41:24.120
The color red, obviously, is not a sum of parts

41:24.120 --> 41:26.960
because it doesn't even have parts.

41:29.800 --> 41:31.640
That's a good one.

41:31.720 --> 41:37.960
It was Aristotle, really, who recognized

41:37.960 --> 41:42.480
the difference between quantities and qualities.

41:42.480 --> 41:46.480
And the point is that qualities are characterized

41:46.480 --> 41:49.400
by the fact that they have no parts.

41:49.640 --> 42:08.920
So the upshot is that physics and our physical sciences deal

42:08.920 --> 42:15.760
with a very limited aspect of reality.

42:15.760 --> 42:20.560
And in fact, this is where its power comes from.

42:20.560 --> 42:27.400
I always like to quote Goethe, who has said so many wise things.

42:27.400 --> 42:32.080
And one of them is, quote, you understand it,

42:32.080 --> 42:35.800
in the Beschränkung zeigt sich der Meister.

42:35.800 --> 42:41.040
In limitation, the master shows himself.

42:41.040 --> 42:45.080
So the point is that physics gains its power

42:45.080 --> 42:48.440
through the enormity of its limitation.

42:48.440 --> 42:50.480
And what is that limitation?

42:50.480 --> 42:56.440
The limitation is that it will concentrate entirely

42:56.440 --> 42:58.760
upon quantities.

42:58.760 --> 43:05.600
The physicist has no eye for qualities.

43:05.600 --> 43:07.440
He sees no color.

43:07.440 --> 43:10.600
He sees nothing but quantities.

43:10.600 --> 43:14.080
And therefore, he sees nothing but sums of parts.

43:14.080 --> 43:17.120
This is an enormous limitation.

43:17.120 --> 43:20.960
And it is the enormity of this limitation

43:20.960 --> 43:25.960
that gives physics its equally enormous power.

43:28.600 --> 43:35.520
So this, if I had any influence upon universities, which I don't,

43:35.520 --> 43:39.440
this is what I would like to convey to the students,

43:39.440 --> 43:42.040
because it makes for wisdom.

43:42.040 --> 43:46.520
It makes for real understanding.

43:46.520 --> 43:54.960
Our scientific Weltanschauung is bought at a cost.

43:54.960 --> 43:59.920
We pay something to get that Weltanschauung.

43:59.920 --> 44:06.080
And what we pay, in other words, what we lose in the process,

44:06.080 --> 44:13.800
is the qualitative side of the world,

44:13.800 --> 44:21.080
which we completely leave out of account

44:21.080 --> 44:23.800
in our physical sciences.

44:27.880 --> 44:35.600
So actually, if you want to be very precise, very rigorous,

44:35.600 --> 44:45.880
you could say that there is no contemporary scientific Weltanschauung

44:45.880 --> 44:52.120
for the simple reason that our sciences are based upon physics.

44:52.120 --> 45:00.640
And the physical world cannot really be looked upon at all.

45:00.640 --> 45:07.440
The only way you can deal with it is through mathematical equations.

45:07.440 --> 45:14.200
And so in order to make a Weltanschauung out of the findings of physics,

45:14.200 --> 45:19.240
we have to add something to that,

45:19.240 --> 45:25.160
which cannot in any way be based upon physics.

45:25.160 --> 45:30.400
So in a sense, our contemporary Weltanschauung is a fake.

45:30.440 --> 45:32.400
It is a fallacy.

45:32.400 --> 45:34.880
It's a contradiction in terms,

45:34.880 --> 45:40.720
because if the world were really what the physicist takes it to be,

45:40.720 --> 45:44.960
that does not give rise to Weltanschauung.

45:44.960 --> 45:49.920
This is nothing that you can tell the non-physicist,

45:49.920 --> 45:53.720
aha, that's what the world is like,

45:53.720 --> 46:00.280
because all that remains basically are equations.

46:00.280 --> 46:06.120
And the non-specialist doesn't understand these equations,

46:06.120 --> 46:11.080
nor does it make any sense to say that in reality,

46:11.080 --> 46:14.520
the world reduces to equations.

46:14.520 --> 46:17.560
This is really nonsense.

46:17.560 --> 46:21.440
And this is why I like the saying of Goethe so much,

46:21.440 --> 46:33.520
because this Goethe's dictum really tells us why the physicist's Weltanschauung

46:33.520 --> 46:36.040
is not a Weltanschauung at all,

46:36.040 --> 46:41.640
unless he added something, an ingredient which is not part of physics,

46:41.640 --> 46:46.640
he couldn't speak to the non-physicist.

46:46.640 --> 46:48.240
Can I quote you from your book?

46:48.240 --> 46:50.920
I just remind me of something you wrote.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
Please.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
Please.

46:53.000 --> 47:00.200
You said that people today model along and don't even know anymore what is model

47:00.200 --> 47:04.600
and what is fact, and it's something that I find is really a good quote.

47:04.600 --> 47:09.000
It made me chuckle a bit.

47:09.000 --> 47:12.080
I had the same thing when I was younger.

47:12.080 --> 47:16.000
It almost feels like the scientific worldview,

47:16.000 --> 47:19.560
which isn't actually a worldview,

47:19.600 --> 47:22.800
but it pretends to be one, at least.

47:22.800 --> 47:25.120
But it doesn't tell you it is.

47:25.120 --> 47:30.160
I had to find out later that there is a distinction between modeling the world

47:30.160 --> 47:32.800
or describing the world and the world in itself,

47:32.800 --> 47:37.920
and the model of the world is not the same thing as the world.

47:37.920 --> 47:41.960
And I can understand why people get confused, let's say,

47:41.960 --> 47:45.800
and we need people like Wolfgang and other people

47:45.800 --> 47:51.000
to reintroduce this classical idea, actually.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
We seem to have forgotten that.

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
So I just wanted to add that.

47:57.000 --> 48:09.480
Yes, as a result of this dominance of physical science in our time,

48:09.480 --> 48:19.160
our intellectuals have become very, very confused.

48:19.160 --> 48:25.800
And in these days of mass communication,

48:25.800 --> 48:30.040
these ideas remain not only amongst the intellectuals.

48:30.040 --> 48:33.960
It pervades our civilization.

48:33.960 --> 48:36.360
I think nowadays, even in grade school,

48:36.360 --> 48:43.640
we would give more information about atoms and particles and so on.

48:43.640 --> 48:52.920
So we are very, very confused people, seriously confused.

48:52.920 --> 49:01.960
And it, of course, affects our entire civilization profoundly.

49:01.960 --> 49:07.240
I mean, for example, the arts are profoundly affected

49:07.240 --> 49:14.840
by this so-called scientific Weltanschauung,

49:14.840 --> 49:18.760
which is, I have just tried to explain, is really a fake.

49:18.760 --> 49:24.120
It is really a fake.

49:24.120 --> 49:32.360
But these things are not easy to understand intellectually.

49:32.360 --> 49:41.080
It requires certain qualifications, which are apparently quite rare.

49:41.080 --> 49:51.160
And so the confusion remains and, in fact, perpetuates itself.

49:51.160 --> 49:59.080
And it's getting worse and worse.

49:59.080 --> 50:01.960
We are very, very confused people.

50:01.960 --> 50:06.520
And it is affecting our culture as a whole.

50:06.520 --> 50:15.720
And to the extent that one actually sees what is going on,

50:15.720 --> 50:20.360
one cannot but be very worried.

50:21.080 --> 50:29.240
Wolfgang, you introduced a concept as a correlation to horizontal causation,

50:29.240 --> 50:30.520
it's vertical causation.

50:30.520 --> 50:35.880
And you picked up on where Heisenberg said something about quantum particles,

50:35.880 --> 50:38.760
that they're somewhere between being and non-being.

50:38.760 --> 50:41.400
It has such a reminiscent of Aristotelian potentiae.

50:41.400 --> 50:44.360
And this is something you picked up on.

50:44.360 --> 50:46.760
And you said something interesting, you're quoted in your documentary,

50:46.760 --> 50:51.000
saying that no one on either side of the Copenhagen debate

50:51.000 --> 50:53.960
seemed to have realized that it was the role of quantum particles

50:53.960 --> 50:57.160
not to bestow, but to receive being.

50:57.160 --> 51:03.560
And so this plays into your idea of vertical causation,

51:03.560 --> 51:05.640
which Jack had alluded to earlier.

51:05.640 --> 51:11.560
Yeah. I want to respond to what you have just said, Brian,

51:11.880 --> 51:17.720
because it touches upon something very, very major.

51:17.720 --> 51:23.320
Heisenberg was a very, very unusual physicist.

51:23.320 --> 51:32.280
He was different from all the other physicists by the fact that he was the son of a classicist.

51:33.000 --> 51:39.480
His father was a classicist and Heisenberg himself was very

51:39.480 --> 51:45.800
worth in, say, the philosophy of Plato, the philosophy of Aristotle.

51:46.520 --> 51:55.080
He had a high degree of insight into these ancient doctrines.

51:55.080 --> 51:59.560
And that set him off from the rest of the physicists.

52:00.520 --> 52:10.600
And he was really alone among physicists to recognize that

52:13.240 --> 52:18.600
these so-called quantum particles really had no being.

52:18.920 --> 52:29.400
Physicists by and large regarded these particles as the ultimate building blocks of the world

52:30.360 --> 52:41.160
when, in fact, Heisenberg, due to his knowledge of ancient philosophy,

52:41.880 --> 52:48.520
recognized that they could not be that because, in fact, they lack being.

52:49.320 --> 52:55.560
You cannot build a world out of things which don't exist, which don't have being.

52:56.680 --> 53:04.360
So on the other hand, Heisenberg never managed to

53:05.240 --> 53:16.360
take these recognitions all the way and build what might be called a complete

53:16.360 --> 53:22.440
philosophy of physics, which puts everything in its right place.

53:23.160 --> 53:34.840
He never managed to do that, but he did recognize the fact that quantum particles

53:35.720 --> 53:42.760
are potentie, that means they don't really exist, but they are

53:43.080 --> 53:49.480
material in relation to form.

53:51.480 --> 54:06.360
So I picked up, as it were, on this note and I recognized

54:06.360 --> 54:19.000
very clearly that this is what the measurement problem is all about.

54:21.000 --> 54:32.600
When you measure a quantum system, you give being to some entities which previously were mere

54:32.680 --> 54:46.040
potency, and if a measuring instrument were itself a quantum system, you obviously couldn't do that.

54:47.240 --> 54:59.960
Somewhere along the line, you need to bring into play some entities which have being

54:59.960 --> 55:12.200
so that they can then affect the transition from the potency of a quantum particle

55:12.200 --> 55:16.440
to the actuality of a measurement of a measured system.

55:17.080 --> 55:33.240
So I realized that there is an ontological difference between an ordinary corporeal entity,

55:33.240 --> 55:41.880
the kind of entities that we encounter in our conscious life, a chair, a table,

55:42.520 --> 55:49.240
or anything that you can pick up, anything that you can actually perceive.

55:50.520 --> 55:59.400
So these are corporeal entities and they are ontologically different from a mere quantum system,

55:59.960 --> 56:04.520
because they do have, being a quantum system does not.

56:05.480 --> 56:14.920
So based upon this very, very simple recognition, I found a very, very simple solution

56:14.920 --> 56:23.080
to the so-called measurement problem. The point is, in order to measure a quantum system,

56:23.880 --> 56:31.880
you need, which is a mere potency, a mere potency, you need something that is more than a potency

56:32.440 --> 56:41.800
and these kind of entities are called corporeal entities. The chair I'm sitting on is corporeal,

56:41.800 --> 56:54.120
otherwise I couldn't sit on it. So the first new idea that I introduced and that needs to be

56:54.120 --> 57:01.480
introduced, if you want to solve the measurement problem, is the distinction between a corporeal

57:02.440 --> 57:10.520
entity and the associated physical entity, so the corporeal entity is more and this more

57:10.520 --> 57:19.960
is essential in the act of measurement. But that was not enough in order to

57:20.600 --> 57:39.320
to complete the argument, you need to recognize that if measurement is a transition from potency

57:39.320 --> 57:53.560
to act, you need a corresponding causality, because the transition from potency to act

57:57.160 --> 58:03.720
cannot take place in time, it can only be instantaneous, because there's nothing in between

58:04.680 --> 58:14.600
the potency and act. So it is an instantaneous effect. Now physics deals with a causality,

58:14.600 --> 58:23.000
which I call horizontal causality, which itself takes place in time. That's why you can write a

58:23.000 --> 58:31.960
differential equation, because this is a causality which is really a process in time. But the causality

58:31.960 --> 58:43.080
that you need in order to measure a quantum system cannot be a causality that takes place in time,

58:43.080 --> 58:52.680
because as I said, it has to be instantaneous. And so this led to the discovery, if you will, of

58:53.240 --> 59:00.120
so-called vertical causation. Vertical causation is an entirely different kind of causation,

59:00.920 --> 59:06.520
and it is characterized by the fact that it takes place instantaneously.

59:08.520 --> 59:17.720
And so these are the two ontological ideas that I introduced in 1995,

59:18.680 --> 59:29.800
in connection with the measurement problem. And let me just point out that it was very

59:29.800 --> 59:38.520
interesting that three years later, exactly, William Demsky wrote his book on intelligent design,

59:39.560 --> 59:46.120
in which he proved that theorem, which I have just mentioned, to the effect that it takes

59:47.000 --> 01:00:00.280
vertical causality to effect, to produce complex specified information. So I guess the time for

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:14.280
the discovery of vertical causality had come, because two independent books demonstrated

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:20.760
the need for that kind of causality. Where does that causality come from, this vertical causality?

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:25.880
Excuse me, Jack. Where does this vertical causality come from?

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:37.480
Ah, well, that is a wonderful question, because actually it turns out that you can have vertical

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:48.520
causality only in a Platonist cosmos. You need a cosmos as Plato himself conceived of it,

01:00:49.720 --> 01:01:02.840
because the Platonist cosmos is inherently tripartite. It consists of three levels, if you will,

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:11.160
in which the first level, the highest level, what Plato called the intelligible,

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:30.440
is not subject to either space or time. And it is this intelligible, I call it,

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:35.800
eternal level from which vertical causation emanates.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:41.640
Can you please help me with the word eternal? My spellchecker keeps telling me this word doesn't

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:46.680
exist, and I was just curious. I've never come across it. I think it's a beautiful word, but it's it.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:58.600
Well, the word goes back to the Christian middle ages, where

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:15.320
the scholastic philosophers recognized that there is a level in the cosmos

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:29.480
beyond space and time. So then your question is, what is it that distinguishes this kind of eternity

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:38.680
from what theologians want to call eternity? And the answer was given by Thomas Aquinas,

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:58.360
who said that the eternal realm is not subject to time, but time can be added onto it.

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:09.320
These are the words. That means, even though eternity has no time,

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:21.320
it is really part of a cosmos in which time does exist. So it's a very sharp distinction,

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:31.160
but very, very essential from a metaphysical point of view, because the eternity of the

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:43.720
highest cosmic sphere is not to be equated to the eternity that, properly speaking, belongs to

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:54.680
God himself, who is the creator of the world. So the eternity of God is more than the eternity

01:03:55.320 --> 01:04:05.480
of the highest cosmic sphere. Right, and this is where the this eternity is, where the vertical

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:15.640
causation comes from. Exactly. The vertical causation in so far as it does not happen in time,

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:27.640
it therefore comes from the eternal plane. It emanates, let's say. It doesn't emerge.

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:30.920
Emanates, is there any metaphor we can use for this?

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:44.120
There really is not, because here we are dealing with the deepest metaphysical problems,

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:53.560
which being basic cannot be further reduced, so to speak. Fair enough.

01:04:54.280 --> 01:05:09.560
So after writing this book on the quantum enigma, I began to realize that the key

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:21.640
to all these metaphysical questions relating to the nature of physics and the physical world

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:30.760
need to be resolved on a Platonist basis. I've always instinctively been a Platonist,

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:39.320
but it was after this rather intense work I put in on the quantum enigma,

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:47.560
that it became more clear to me than ever before that in order to understand physics,

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:56.680
we need to go back to the Platonist philosophy. This is really the key, this is the right way

01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:06.360
of doing it, and let me say that in light of my latest book, where I actually carry out,

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:23.240
if you will, that plan, I am very gratified and in a way amazed to see that if you look at physics

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:30.760
from a rigorous Platonist point of view, everything becomes very, very simple.

01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:40.200
And not only does it become very, very simple, but you also at the same time realize

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:50.600
that the actual story is the very opposite of what physicists nowadays believe. It's

01:06:50.600 --> 01:07:00.280
the very opposite because basically physicists start with particles and then they want to

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:12.520
from particles step by step build a universe. And it turns out from the Platonist point of view

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:22.600
that I've just alluded to, that the true story is just the other way around. Particles come at

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:31.960
the very end and they even have no being. So the real anthology starts from just the opposite

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:38.200
direction. The true anthology is top down, it is not bottom up.

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:48.760
Interesting. Wolfgang, if I could ask a question, you introduced a reminder that it was reported,

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:55.080
reportedly said or written above the Platonic Academy at Athens, let no one ignorant of geometry

01:07:55.080 --> 01:08:03.480
enter here. And I think this informed your concept of the tripartite cosmos and a tripartite man.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:13.560
And it takes shape of an icon of a circle with a center point. And would it be fair to characterize

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:22.440
this icon reflecting the human person, let's say, or any created entity? Well, in particular,

01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:27.320
you introduced the intellect, the idea of the intellect. So you reintroduced a distinction

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:35.560
between the intellect and reason and then the corporeal. The intellect is instantaneous. It's

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:43.000
not constrained by time or space and it's how we perceive things. And this is, you did quite a

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.720
bit of research into James J. Gibson's theory of ecological perception which supported this.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:52.920
And then there's the distinction between the intellectual moving into the rational, which is

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:59.560
discursive thought that takes place in time but requires no space. And then being terminates on

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:05.480
the level of the corporeal, let's say, where the person manifests him or herself in space and time.

01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:09.240
And so each person has these three aspects to their nature, the intelligible,

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:13.800
they have access to this where there's no space, no time, they have access to the

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:20.360
reason and the rational discursive thought in time, no space, and the corporeal. So maybe

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:27.560
I know Jack was interested in your research on James J. Gibson and how this ties into that concept.

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:41.400
Well, you raise a very fundamental question. I think the first thing that I should point out is that

01:09:42.280 --> 01:10:01.480
it is very enlightening to associate the Platonist doctrine of the three levels of the cosmos

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:10.040
with the bounds of space and time. And incidentally, I don't see this

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:18.360
talked about in the Platonist philosophy.

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:26.600
They must have known it because they were very wise and this is very basic,

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:36.600
but I don't find it written about, say, in the Timaeus or the other relevant dialogues.

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:48.920
The point is this. Platonism distinguishes three levels of the cosmos. The supreme level,

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:58.520
which is beyond time, is called the intelligible, I call it the eternal.

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:09.800
The second level, which the Platonists call the psychic or the vital, I call it the intermediary.

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:18.680
The second level, I say, and this I do not find explicitly in the Platonist dialogues,

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:29.080
the second level is subject to time but not to space. So the intermediary level, which is a psychic,

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:38.760
is subject to time but not to space. And then, of course, as you would expect,

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:48.520
the third or lowest, what we call the corporeal level, is subject to both time and space.

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:57.800
So you have these three levels of the cosmos and you can, if you will, define them in terms of the

01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:05.480
two bounds, time and space. There is a level that is subject to neither, there's a level that is

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:11.640
subject to time but not to space, and then there's a level that is subject to both. So this is very

01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:30.600
simple. And amazing consequences fall there and so from this way of looking at the matter.

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:44.680
And I think perhaps the one that will interest our listeners the most is the fact that the existence

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:56.120
of a time-only level of the cosmos, the existence of what I call the intermediary plane,

01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:07.720
in itself disproves or disqualifies Einstein and relativity. Einstein and relativity, which

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:21.400
it is, were fuses space and time in what is called spacetime. If Einstein were right,

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:32.440
there could be no cosmic realm, subject to time but not to space, because space and time are,

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:45.640
so to speak, two different aspects of a spacetime, which includes both. So one of the obviously

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:59.640
most interesting consequences of this recognition of the Platonist ontology as affirming an intermediary

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:08.120
realm, subject to time alone, one most amazing consequences of this is that it disqualifies

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:22.520
Einstein and relativity at a single scale. So sorry, and sometimes I agree.

01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:29.320
Well, that was something I would like to, before I forget, I didn't have many questions, but there

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:36.680
was a paper you mentioned by J. Gibson. I just mentioned it yourself too, and I haven't read

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:47.000
papers simply because I'm not really good at reading papers, but I hope you can summarize the

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:53.960
general idea behind it, because all I understand from it is that we see reality how it is.

01:14:55.080 --> 01:15:02.280
That's what I read in your book or in the key points, that we see reality as it is.

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:09.960
What does Gibson mean by that? Well, I'm so glad you brought up the name of James Gibson,

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:19.640
because I really think he is one of the absolutely most important scientists of the 20th century,

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:34.440
because he has single-handedly corrected a major mistake of post-Cartesian science

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:47.720
by rediscovering the fact that in visual perception, what you actually perceive

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:59.080
is not inside the head, it's in the external world itself. We do perceive mountains and trees,

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:08.440
and we do perceive color. So in my language, what we perceive is exactly the corporeal world

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:21.240
as distinguished from the physical. It is an amazing achievement on the part of Gibson

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:32.040
to have actually formulated in rigorous empirical terms a theory of visual perception,

01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:40.600
which completely breaks with the so-called retinal image theory, which as we know,

01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:48.600
think of perception as a process originating in the retina. These

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:57.880
rods and cones are stimulated by light impinging upon the retina, and so then there are nerve

01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:09.000
currents set up into the cortex, and a very, very complicated process ensues in which

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:19.160
involves something on the order of 20 or 21 visual centers in the cortex, and libraries have been

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:29.720
filled with the product of that research. But the fact of the matter is that

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:42.440
when all is said and done, we can just trace the process of seeing, the process of visual perception

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:50.440
to a bunch of visual centers in the cortex, none of which actually

01:17:51.320 --> 01:18:03.720
contains that image that we see. And so it turns out that

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:15.880
the so-called retinal image theory of visual perception doesn't really lead to perception.

01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:24.520
It leads in a sense to the very opposite in the sense that these different visual centers

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:33.560
take the image apart, and as Sir Francis Crick said famously, we see how the image,

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:42.520
how the brain takes the image apart. We do not yet see how the brain puts the picture back together

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:51.080
again, and the obvious fact is that the brain does not put the picture back together again.

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:59.800
In fact, it can't. And the fact that it can't has come to be known as a so-called binding problem.

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:10.600
The problem is you've got, say, a million neurons in these visual centers of the brain,

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:24.120
and as a result of light striking the retina, these are in various modes of on and off position.

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:33.800
How do you make a picture out of this vast multiplicity of neuronal states?

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:41.400
And in other words, how does the brain put the picture back together again?

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:49.080
And the answer quite obviously is the brain can do no such thing. And so this has become known

01:19:49.800 --> 01:20:02.440
in the world of, this has become known as the binding problem. And the fact of the matter is

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:15.400
that the binding problem really has no solution on a neuronal basis. The neurons

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:21.880
take the picture apart, they do not, they cannot put it back together again. And so

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:37.400
at one point, I simply stated the obvious fact that the binding problem cannot be

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:47.800
solved on the corporeal level. In other words, the only way the binding problem can solve,

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:55.880
can be solved, the way it is solved, is that in our integral being, we are not

01:20:56.440 --> 01:21:03.800
subject to the condition of space. In our corporeal nature, yes, on that level,

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:12.680
we are subject to the condition of space. And this is where all that neurophysiology takes place.

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:21.480
But the actual binding takes place on the next level up, which is the level of the

01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:30.200
intermediary or psychic plane. So the answer to the binding problem is this,

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:36.520
it is resolved not on the corporeal level, but on the psychic.

01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:47.240
So if we were purely corporeal creatures, we could not see anything. There could be no perception.

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:55.320
And incidentally, so we have these three levels of the cosmos, the

01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:06.120
intelligible, the psychic and the corporeal. And I just want to point out that in days gone by,

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:14.440
every child really knew that the human being himself

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:32.840
consists of three levels. In Latin, it's anima, soul, psyche, mind, and intellect or spiritus.

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:42.040
So corpus anima spiritus, this trichotomy of man, is simply, simply

01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:52.680
tells us that man is a microcosm. Man is the cosmos in miniature. So even as the cosmos is

01:22:52.680 --> 01:23:02.600
tripartite, the anthropos is also tripartite. And if we were not tripartite, for example,

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:10.600
visual perception would be impossible. And this is what has now baffled

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:19.000
the neurophysiologists. This is the binding problem which no one has solved. And no one

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:28.440
can solve on the corporeal level. The binding problem would be impossible to solve if it were

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:39.320
not for the fact that man is more than a body. Man has not only a body, he has also a soul.

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:47.480
And then there's the third component, above soul there is spiritus. And we need all three,

01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:55.720
actually it turns out, excuse me, it turns out that in addition to the intermediary,

01:23:56.600 --> 01:24:06.840
the eternal level in man is also needed for ordinary perception, because there could be no

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:13.240
perception of motion. If you think about it deeply, the perception of motion

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:20.200
is possible only because within man there is a level above time itself.

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:32.200
So if we were completely immersed in time, we could not perceive motion.

01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:40.920
And this is what Gibson discovered, didn't he, is that perception didn't take place as a series of

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:49.480
points in time, but was required constant motion and was instantaneous. Yes. The point about Gibson

01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:57.080
is that he was all empiricists. He was one of the greatest empiricists, I think the world has ever

01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:06.520
seen, but he was not a metaphysician. And when you read his papers, he expresses himself

01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:15.720
in purely empiricist terms. He won't talk to you about, he doesn't write about

01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:27.240
matter and form or a psychic realm subject to time and not to space. This is not the language he

01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:40.760
uses. He was an empiricist of absolutely first rank. I'm very happy that he has been recognized and

01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:49.080
acknowledged. I think the academic community has honored him and made him a member of the

01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:57.080
Academy of Science and so on. They have greatly honored him. And I think they have done so

01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:05.160
because they have not recognized how dangerous he is to everything that they stand for.

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:13.240
Because if they would really understand Gibson, they would realize, to quote my friend Alexander

01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:24.440
Unziger, they would realize that for 30 years they've been talking nonsense. Because he destroyed

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:43.000
that materialist ontology, which underlies our academic sciences as the assumption that nobody

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:50.440
really wants to talk about. You assume it, it is not talked about. I think this is a good place to

01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:57.160
end it here. Well, unless you want to go on. I mean, I don't want to text you too much.

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:10.360
As you know, from reading this latest book of mine, I have still many things, basic things to say,

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:20.360
but I'm happy to end at any point that you, I still have some energy left in me.

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:28.200
If you can go, we'll just go on. I just, I want to be considerate here. Because

01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:37.720
then we just will go on a little bit. We'll see how far we can go. The reason I asked for Gibson,

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:43.560
for your explanation of Gibson's argument, because I wasn't necessarily familiar with it,

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:50.520
is we also had on Donald Hoffman, and he's a mathematician, and he said, well, he said the

01:27:50.520 --> 01:28:01.160
opposite. But now that I heard your argument, I'm not sure if that's just, I'm not sure if it's

01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:06.760
just semantics or not, because his argument was that we almost certainly do not see reality

01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:16.520
as it is. But that argument was based on evolution. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Donald Hoffman.

01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:27.880
Well, let me tell you quite frankly, that I'm not familiar with most of the contemporary

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:35.960
thinkers who have made a name for themselves, because as you can see from what has already

01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:48.120
transpired in our conversation, I stand really on the opposite pole of the contemporary worldview.

01:28:48.760 --> 01:29:04.520
I'm a Platonist. I've always been a Platonist. And the older I get, the more deeply I value

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:17.320
Plato. And the more instinctively I look upon our issues from a Platonist point of view. And this

01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:30.920
point of view is quite evidently the very opposite of the modern or contemporary way of looking at

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:42.440
things. The contemporary way of looking at things is basically Democratian. From a Platonist point

01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:52.440
of view, we're repeating the Democratian heresy. And in a way, priding ourselves on that.

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:59.800
The point being that we are trying to understand

01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:10.440
complex things, corporeal things and mental things, except being something

01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:19.960
supramental, that too, we're trying to understand everything on the basis of atoms and the void.

01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:28.680
In other words, in modern terms, this would be quantum particles. And I think it already emerges

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:41.560
from what we have been talking about this morning, that you do not understand anything ontologically

01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:51.400
if you imagine that things reduce the quantum particles. Because in point of fact, quantum

01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:58.440
particles have no being. They're not really there. They are near potences. And obviously,

01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:11.880
the universe is not a potency, but an actuality. So from my Platonist point of view, contemporary

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:24.520
thought regarding the nature of cosmic reality is upside down. We are standing upside down. We

01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:33.960
are trying to understand actuality in terms of potency. And it's a hopeless process.

01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:43.320
And so I have read comparatively few contemporary authors. And the only

01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:51.480
contemporary authors that I've really read with great interest, like, for example, James Gibson,

01:31:52.040 --> 01:32:02.840
is due to the fact that he opposes the contemporary point of view. Gibson interests me so enormously.

01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:09.320
Because he says the opposite of most other cognitive psychologists.

01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:17.880
Wolfgang, what could you say specifically that Gibson discovered about perception, meaning

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:24.520
what was it about the nature of perception that was so distinct from the retinal image version?

01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:34.680
Well, he discovered something that practically no one in the contemporary scientific world

01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:44.680
was prepared to believe. Namely, that what we see in visual perception is not inside the head,

01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:55.320
it's outside. We actually perceive a mountain or a rose. If the rose is red, we actually perceive

01:32:55.320 --> 01:33:03.720
that redness in the rose. This is what, of course, the ancients believed. This was in Plato's day,

01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:12.840
everyone would have agreed. But it goes completely contrary to everything that the

01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:21.240
Western intelligentsia has believed since the days of René Descartes. And so

01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:31.320
it comes as an enormous shock, or should come as an enormous shock to the educated world of our day,

01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:40.280
that someone like Gibson has made these discoveries, and in a way which cannot really be refuted.

01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:48.280
You introduced René Descartes, and one of the topics that you like to talk about is the notion

01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:55.240
of bifurcation, which was a term coined by Alfred North Whitehead to describe Descartes' bifurcated

01:33:55.240 --> 01:34:01.560
world between thought and extension. And I have a feeling that that plays a role in, let's say,

01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:11.160
Professor Hoffman's conception of perceiving the world as conjecture in our mind as opposed to the

01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:23.960
world as it is. Yeah, I'm glad, Brian, that you brought up the idea of bifurcation, because it is

01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:38.120
really very, very basic. Descartes introduced it in the 17th century, and it is simply the postulate

01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:53.560
that the world, the realm of existing things splits into two categories. There is the first

01:34:53.560 --> 01:35:03.080
category is what he calls res extensé, which means extended entities. And these are entities which

01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:21.080
exist in space, and they have no other attributes than the fact that they exist in space and time.

01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:35.720
Everything that is not a res extensor is what Descartes calls a res cogitans, which means a thing of

01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:46.040
the mind. So having split the entire universe into extended entities on one side and mental entities

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:58.520
on the other, he has set the world up, ideally for the mathematical physicists, because it tells

01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:05.640
the mathematical physicists that the real world, the world that exists outside and not inside the head,

01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:16.040
consists of only extended entities. So this suggested to Sir Isaac Newton and to physicists

01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:24.120
really ever after, that the real world is precisely the world as the physicists concede of it.

01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:32.040
These are the things that can be described in mathematical terms.

01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:42.360
It began in a crude way with mechanisms that are somewhat like a clockwork. And you remember

01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:49.800
in the 17th century, in fact, they built these mechanisms. You see them in Venice.

01:36:54.200 --> 01:37:00.200
And they built them because they really thought that that's what the real world is like. It's a

01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:11.800
world of cogs and wheels interacting mechanically. And so the physicists were delighted because Descartes

01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:23.800
left them with an exterior so-called external world of the kind that really is made for

01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:32.840
mathematical analysis. It's ideal. The physicist was in his paradise. And however,

01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:49.800
it turns out that by reducing the external world to res extensé, making out of it a kind of clockwork

01:37:49.800 --> 01:38:06.040
universe, Descartes misrepresented the external world. He oversimplified it. And we have been

01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:15.720
paying the price ever since. Now, this Cartesian dichotomy into res extensé and res cogitantes

01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:23.800
has become, so to speak, second nature among physicists.

01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:35.720
Every physicist learns this bifurcationist outlook very early in life. And then he

01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:48.600
learns it so deeply and so naturally that he doesn't recognize it as a postulate.

01:38:50.600 --> 01:39:01.080
Most physicists, it turns out, are really incapable of grasping bifurcation as a philosophical

01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:08.200
axiom, an assumption which may or may not be true. And so it was Alfred North Whitehead

01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:17.080
who coined that term bifurcation. And then he went to all the finest universities in

01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:28.840
the UK and in the States, lecturing physicists about this assumption that unwittingly they

01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:36.200
have made. And he pointed out to them that it has created an incredible model.

01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:44.680
And in the hope of waking them up as it were, but the fact of the matter is that

01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:53.320
it's uncertain whether there exists even one famous physicist who is not

01:39:54.040 --> 01:40:05.160
instinctively bifurcationist. So bifurcation is then a metaphysical axiom which physicists

01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:14.920
almost without exception or perhaps actually without exception believe in. Now, the important

01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:25.640
thing is that bifurcation is ultimately untenable. It is not true. It is a metaphysical error.

01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:32.920
And in a sense, we know that since the days of Democritus, because in a sense,

01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:43.800
Democritus is the first philosopher in history to introduce bifurcation into the

01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:58.120
into philosophical discourse. So the upshot of the matter is that physics,

01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:10.840
as it is understood in our day, is bound up with this axiom of bifurcation, which it assumes

01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:23.880
rigidly. And once you have assumed that axiom, you are committed to a kind of crude materialism,

01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:33.240
which cannot possibly be true. It's an error that invalidates your wealth and show.

01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:42.200
In fact, Heisenberg spoke about it as well, didn't he? He wrote about it. I had a quote here,

01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:48.760
and he wrote, if one follows with great difficulty, which even eminent scientists like

01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:53.720
Einstein have an understanding in accepting the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory

01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:59.080
one can trace the roots of that difficulty to the Cartesian partition. And he goes on to say

01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:04.200
that this partition has penetrated deeply into the human mind during the three centuries following

01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:09.000
Descartes, and it will take a long time for it to be replaced by a really different attitude

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:13.160
toward the reality problem. That was from Heisenberg, which might come as a surprise to me.

01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:22.920
The interesting thing about Heisenberg is that here and there in his writings,

01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:33.480
you will find passages like the one that you just read. But I've made a rather thorough study of

01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:39.320
Heisenberg because I regard him as among all the physicists, he was the most enlightened

01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:49.000
metaphysically far more than anyone else that I can name. But the fact of the matter is that

01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:59.640
there are other passages, you can quote in the writings of Werner Heisenberg,

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:09.960
where he is in fact placing himself on a bifurcationist basis. So he was not completely,

01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:21.560
he was far more enlightened metaphysically than any other well-known physicist of our time.

01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:33.800
And I say this is due to the fact that he was a son of a classicist. Through his father, he came to

01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:45.640
know Platonism and philosophy of Aristotle and so forth. But he was not altogether consistent.

01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:51.480
And I think if he had

01:43:55.960 --> 01:44:08.280
comprehended non-bifurcation more deeply, he would have resolved the

01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:18.520
leading problems in the philosophy of physics, which he did not actually resolve.

01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:29.640
He gives us clues, occasionally very perceptive clues, but he did not carry through to solve.

01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:35.160
For example, he did not give us a solution of the measurement problem.

01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:48.920
The so-called Copenhagen rule, which he and Niels Bohr proposed, was a way, gave us a way of doing

01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:59.480
physics without getting into trouble. But the reason for the Copenhagen cut is something

01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:10.920
that he never articulated explicitly, which he could have based upon the recognition that bifurcation

01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:23.960
is false. I have a question from the audience. When I read your book, you seem to have a lot of

01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:29.480
quote from Unsikker. Unsikker, I'm not sure how you pronounce it. How do you pronounce it?

01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:38.920
Unsikker. Unsikker. Okay. And Ben Moffo asks, what does Dr. Smith think of Unsikker's variable

01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:49.080
light speed theory? Well, Unsikker is a great admirer of Albert Einstein. In fact, in his

01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:59.640
recent book, just published a short while ago, he goes into the Einsteinian physics in a very

01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:09.960
interesting way. And it clearly reveals that he regards Einsteinian physics as the key to a deeper

01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:18.360
understanding of the subject. And so on this point, Alexander Unsikker and I are completely on

01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:26.600
opposite sides of the issue. I regard Einsteinian physics as fundamentally misconceived.

01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:40.760
The reason that this is not universally known or accepted resides in the fact that

01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:55.320
Einsteinian physics differs from classical physics, mathematically, by a square root for one minus

01:46:55.320 --> 01:47:04.200
v squared over c squared, where b is the velocity of the system of the object that you are speaking

01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:14.120
about. And c is the velocity of light. Now, since the speed of light is about 300,000 kilometers per

01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:25.320
second, one minus v squared over c squared is so incredibly close to one, unless you get up to speeds

01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:32.760
which approach the speed of light, which is very hard to do in an empirical setting.

01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:44.760
So on account of this fact, the deviation between Einsteinian physics and non-Einsteinian physics

01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:56.360
is so small as to be practically unmeasurable. There is one, what is regarded as an Einsteinian

01:47:56.360 --> 01:48:07.720
formula, which is not covered by this observation. And that is a formula E equals mc squared,

01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:19.880
called the atom bomb formula. Now, it is true that Einstein derived this formula from his 1905

01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:31.000
paper. What is generally unknown, even among physicists, is the fact that the formula E equals

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:39.560
mc squared can also be derived from classical physics. In a word, it has nothing to do with

01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:49.800
relativity. And this is one of the reasons why Einsteinian physics has been just about

01:48:49.800 --> 01:49:01.080
universally accepted, is because if you regard E for mc squared to be a relativistic formula,

01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:07.880
well, that certainly and unfortunately has proved itself to be absolutely correct.

01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:11.560
So what I'm saying is that

01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:27.560
Einsteinian physics has not really passed the empirical test. People think it has, but

01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:35.480
if you actually go into the details, about 50 different experiments that can be listed,

01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:43.960
which were designed to test relativistic effects, not one of them really stands up,

01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:54.760
understood the name. And the exception, the parent exception, the E equals mc squared formula,

01:49:55.720 --> 01:50:03.000
that does stand up on the scrutiny, but it has nothing to do with relativity theory at all.

01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:16.520
It can equally well be derived from classical physics. So therefore, I believe that our present

01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:25.080
addiction, if you will, to Einsteinian physics is misconceived. And I think the time will come,

01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:34.120
perhaps very soon, when this will come to light, and Einstein will be discredited.

01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:42.440
Right. But this person was asking about variable light speed, or at least the variable light speed

01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:49.480
theory. I'm not acquainted with the theory, but I'm imagining that light can go different speeds,

01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:52.040
and that would probably solve some problems.

01:50:55.160 --> 01:51:09.720
Yes, I'm not an expert on these things at all. I have done some inquiry into Einsteinian physics,

01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:17.240
because for various reasons, this has interested me a lot. And I did, as I have just indicated,

01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:31.160
come to the conclusion that the theory has been accepted on spurious grounds, that a lot of

01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:40.520
ideology enters into it. It's a very complicated story. I would love to read a book,

01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:47.960
which has not yet been written, which, so to speak, gives the inside story of what stands behind

01:51:47.960 --> 01:51:53.720
Einsteinian physics and that fascination, that love affair, if you will, that we've had with

01:51:53.720 --> 01:52:01.400
Einsteinian physics. I'd be very interested to know more about that. All I know is that

01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:13.720
there has been a lot of misconception on this subject, and in particular, I do disagree with

01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:21.880
Alexander Unziger on this point. Fair enough. I don't have, it's not a question, but a statement

01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:28.440
someone made. Could be me, he said, many of the comments Dr. Smith has made and his attention to

01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:35.720
Plato seems to align with ideas we hear from John Furveki. Well, could be me, there is a,

01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:42.280
as far as Dr. Smith has done an interview with John Furveki, at least one, I think, right?

01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:47.880
I've had two conversations with him, yeah. Well, there you go. So, if you're listening,

01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:53.880
check it out. They're probably very, very good. John Furveki is an excellent speaker,

01:52:54.440 --> 01:53:01.160
very creative mind. I love the dear doctor. Very pleased when I saw that one. I was like,

01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:05.240
okay, there's got to be some interesting things in there. Yeah.

01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:17.160
Yes, he's a very, very erudite man and a very deep thinker. And I think what I admire most

01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:26.760
is truly a seeker of truth. Truth is important to him. Not for any ulterior motive, but

01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:32.200
it is important because it should be important. What is more important than truth?

01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:42.680
Should we end it here? This way has been, we have been going on for two hours already.

01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:49.720
And my voice is, I've actually been sick as a dog and I'm trying not to cough.

01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:55.240
And what is acting up right now? So, I think for my own sake, I have to stop this time.

01:53:56.360 --> 01:54:04.520
Well, I thank you so much, Jack, for this interview. I'm very happy to have had an

01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:11.400
opportunity to discuss these matters because I think they are very, very important.

01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:24.600
Important in a very broad sense. I think our civilization is, has been under the influence

01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:35.240
of certain materialist conceptions which prove not to be true. And I think it is very,

01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:44.360
very important that these things be rectified. And I think your program is doing a lot of good in

01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:52.120
the sense that it is helping to bring clarity into these issues. All right, thank you. I really hope

01:54:52.120 --> 01:55:03.720
so. And thank you so much for having the stamina to talk for two hours. Brian, thank you for joining

01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:12.600
us for helping me. Anybody who is listening, thank you too for your comments and for listening.

01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:19.480
I wish you all a very good night and I will see you guys the next time. Good night.

01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:29.400
Thank you and alles Gute. Thanks, Jack. And Jack, if you ever go to visit Wolfgang, you can,

01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:33.640
you better have more stamina than that because he'll go to three in the morning.

01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:41.240
Oh, that's good to know. I did not expect this. I did not expect this, honestly. Okay, guys.

01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:48.120
It was a good conversation. Good night. Good night. Good night. Thank you so much.
