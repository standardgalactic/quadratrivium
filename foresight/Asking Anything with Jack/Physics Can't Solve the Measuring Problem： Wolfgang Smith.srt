1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
So today with us is Wolfgang Smith.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:09,280
He has majors in physics, mathematics, and philosophy.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,320
He contributed a theoretical solution

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,680
to the reentry problem for spaceflight

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,000
during his work as an aerodynamicist.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,520
He has a doctorate in mathematics

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,160
and pursued a career as a mathematician

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,320
until his retirement in 1992.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,560
He devoted himself to the publication of books,

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,920
mission to correct the fallacies of contemporary

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,360
scientific belief, by the way, of insights derived

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,960
from the perennial wisdom of mankind.

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,440
These works focus primarily on foundational problems

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,600
in quantum theory and the problems of visual perception.

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,840
Welcome, Wolfgang.

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,000
Well, thank you.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,120
Glad to be here.

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,720
Very, very glad you're here.

19
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,120
Very excited.

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,440
With us also today is Brian Murphy.

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,320
Now, Brian, could you please introduce yourself

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,200
while you're here?

23
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,720
Hi, Jack.

24
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,920
Thank you and hello to your audience.

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,600
I'll make my comments brief, and then

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,280
I'll turn it back to you and Wolfgang,

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,320
because that's really where the money is in this conversation.

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,920
And I came to know Wolfgang after seeing the documentary

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,320
about him called The End of Quantum Reality.

30
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,400
And after that, I ordered one of his books.

31
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,880
In that case, it was Science and Myth

32
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,320
with a response to Stephen Hawking's The Grand Design.

33
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,480
And after reading that book, I reached out

34
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,760
to the producer of the documentary on Facebook.

35
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,080
And I asked him if he had thought about creating

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,080
an educational initiative in the foundation.

37
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,400
And that led to a conversation and introduction

38
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,280
to Wolfgang and a friendship that has developed

39
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,520
over the past three years.

40
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,320
So we're now developing educational outreach

41
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,720
and hopefully a lecture series under the banner

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,240
of Project Scola.

43
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,600
And we have a number of prominent and highly skilled

44
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,840
and educated scholars from around the world who

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,680
are committed to this endeavor.

46
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,640
And so I have to say, when I read that book,

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,440
and I mean in the first chapter of that book,

48
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,840
the entire edifice of the worldview

49
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,600
that I had imbibed over the many years

50
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,680
just sort of melted into oblivion.

51
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,680
And I think we're all familiar with that worldview.

52
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,720
It's the one that purports to be scientific.

53
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,440
It generally comes from PhDs who tell us

54
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,760
we're sums of parts or composed of atoms or particles

55
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,720
speeding through space and time to no purpose.

56
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,600
And some might even say we have no free will

57
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,760
or that our actions and decisions

58
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,960
are determined in advance by these forces of physics.

59
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,560
And so, but I'm like one of your audience members.

60
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,440
I'm a lay person.

61
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,640
I don't have a PhD.

62
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm not a physicist.

63
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,440
But I'm very interested in this topic

64
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,600
because I think it goes to the very heart of reality.

65
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,280
It goes to the very heart of what it means to be human.

66
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,160
And so in Wolfgang's latest book,

67
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,240
Physics, A Science and Quest of Ontology,

68
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,000
which you're gonna talk to him about,

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,800
Wolfgang really offers a new cosmology,

70
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,600
which is really an ancient cosmology.

71
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,960
And I think it'll really open people's eyes

72
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,600
to things they haven't heard before

73
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,880
or maybe haven't heard in decades.

74
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,520
So the bottom line is what I want your audience to know

75
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,160
is that Wolfgang Smith is not just another guy

76
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,720
with some interesting ideas among many.

77
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,640
No, I really feel there's no one like Wolfgang Smith.

78
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,520
And he has resolved the quantum reality problem,

79
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,880
the measurement problem.

80
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,840
And what he shows with amazing simplicity

81
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,240
is that our world is full of irreducible holes

82
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,560
of beings imbued with qualities

83
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,160
that transcend the world of physics.

84
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,120
And so like Plato's analogy of the cave,

85
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,200
he invites his readers and he invites listeners

86
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,320
to make that ascent out of the cave.

87
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,160
So I would invite you to listen to this man

88
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,400
and become a member of his foundation,

89
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,840
the Philosophia Initiative.

90
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,040
And with that, I'll turn it back to you too.

91
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,960
Thank you.

92
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,280
That was a great introduction.

93
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,760
Thank you.

94
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,240
Probably much better than I would have done.

95
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,400
Now, as I said just before we were in life,

96
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,280
Wolfgang kind of flew under the radar for me.

97
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,760
It kind of surprised me.

98
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,600
I got an email from his publicist and I had to check him out.

99
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,520
And they sent me a book.

100
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,320
This is Physics Assigned in Quest of Nontology.

101
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,760
And it was actually much more interesting

102
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,880
than I initially expected, Wolfgang.

103
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,840
You have a beautiful way of writing, honestly.

104
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,600
But I'm not bad.

105
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,120
But you also take no prisoners.

106
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,560
And I kind of like that.

107
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,320
Let me give you one example here.

108
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,320
And you said, I came upon the words,

109
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,080
there is no way to convince an expert that he or she has

110
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,400
done nonsense for 30 years.

111
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,120
I realized instantly that this person has something to say.

112
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,400
When I read that, I instantly realized

113
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,480
that Wolfgang has something to say to.

114
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:50,600
So it was kind of tongue-in-cheek, but I like it.

115
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,880
Well, the people who are listening right now

116
00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:01,160
are from the idealist space, metaphysical idealism.

117
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:07,520
So we're already not really convinced of scientism.

118
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,880
But it doesn't mean that we have to talk about idealism.

119
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,240
But there's this little thing about,

120
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,320
I haven't read, I haven't come across this in this book.

121
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,640
So before we start, I'm actually kind of curious.

122
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,080
Just what are your thoughts on just consciousness?

123
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,720
I haven't seen the word in this book.

124
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,920
Maybe if you wrote about it, maybe you haven't.

125
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,760
But physicists have a lot to say about consciousness.

126
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,840
And idealists have a lot to say about consciousness.

127
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,120
But I haven't heard Wolfgang say anything about consciousness.

128
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,520
Is there anything you'd like to personally

129
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,160
or professionally say about that topic?

130
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,160
Well, I think the topic of consciousness

131
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,520
is obviously very central, very major.

132
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,960
And what I have to say about it, I think,

133
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:06,320
can best be described as being the very opposite of what

134
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:14,920
is nowadays involved regarding the subject of consciousness.

135
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:25,480
Because I am persuaded that instead of coming somehow

136
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:32,920
up from the bottom by some process of evolution,

137
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,080
consciousness is ultimately, in the final count,

138
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,280
what used to be called a Norman day.

139
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,520
It is actually rooted in divinity itself.

140
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,680
And by way of explication, let me mention

141
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:58,400
that the oldest tradition, intellectual tradition

142
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,040
in the world unquestionably is a Vedic.

143
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,920
And in the Vedic tradition, consciousness

144
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,840
is indeed a Norman day.

145
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:16,400
And it is part of the Sanskrit word satchitananda.

146
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,400
So satchitananda, these are three words put into one.

147
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,560
Sat means being.

148
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,920
Chit means consciousness.

149
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,400
And ananda means bliss.

150
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:40,120
So being consciousness and bliss are, so to speak,

151
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,160
the three aspects or faces, if you will,

152
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,320
of the divinity, the very, very first principle.

153
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:55,160
And I honestly believe that there is no other way

154
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,120
of really understanding consciousness.

155
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,000
It's not an epiphenomenon.

156
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,960
It has nothing whatsoever to do with neurons.

157
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,960
And in fact, it is rooted in the very, very first principle

158
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,720
of all, which is God.

159
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:21,760
So I think these remarks may suffice

160
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:27,920
to show that my thinking is really very far removed

161
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,400
from the contemporary, because the contemporary thinking

162
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,680
is characterized by the fact that almost instinctively,

163
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:42,440
contemporary Western man wants to understand everything

164
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:48,560
from the bottom, which he conceives more or less

165
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,880
in terms of quantum mechanics.

166
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:59,280
And this is, to me, the epitome of error.

167
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,000
And in fact, I would justify this claim

168
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,600
by pointing out that the contemporary metaphysics is

169
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,200
really nothing new, but it is a revival

170
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:23,360
of the philosophy of Democritus, who famously

171
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:37,600
said the Golger believed in qualities, color,

172
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,320
the sweet and the bitter.

173
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,920
But in reality, there is only atoms and the void.

174
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:54,440
So this is basically not only one

175
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,560
of the oldest philosophical positions of mankind,

176
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,520
but it has been revived in the 17th century,

177
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,520
and it has become our modern cradle.

178
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:14,480
And let me mention that very soon after Democritus

179
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:21,200
propounded his theory concerning atoms and the void,

180
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:29,840
Plato attacked it, and I believe rigorously disqualified

181
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,440
this position once and for all.

182
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,960
And so for 2,000 years thereafter,

183
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:45,800
the well-informed regarded this atomistic metaphysics

184
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,760
as a heresy.

185
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,080
And so what happened in the 17th century

186
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:58,640
under the aegis of people like Descartes and Galileo,

187
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:05,880
that ancient heresy was revived and became

188
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:12,320
the foundation of what we nowadays call the Enlightenment.

189
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:21,720
So this is, so to speak, the historical overview of where

190
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,400
we find ourselves today.

191
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:31,920
And needless to say, I have been an opponent

192
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:40,720
of the current Weltanschauung since the age of 14, really.

193
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,800
Really, what happened when you were 14?

194
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,680
That made that happen?

195
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,960
Well, I think the decisive event was that somehow or other,

196
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,600
I came across a very important book,

197
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:02,160
a book by Alfred North Whitehead entitled

198
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,520
Science in the Modern World.

199
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,920
I read this book with great interest.

200
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:15,040
I don't think I understood that much because I was very young.

201
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:23,800
But I understood enough to be fascinated and, in a sense,

202
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:30,720
to be devoted to these questions for the rest of my life.

203
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:41,960
So Whitehead, as it were, awakened my philosophical interest

204
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:47,000
and instincts, if you will, instinctively

205
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,600
when I read about the fallacy of misplaced concreteness

206
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,640
and these things, I realized that this must be true.

207
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:05,560
And so this started me on a career which

208
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,000
put me in the position of the outsider

209
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,240
from the very beginning.

210
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,240
I always felt myself as an outsider

211
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,520
in the contemporary Western culture.

212
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,280
And the reason was that I felt myself as an insider

213
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:30,240
when it comes to the ancient philosophies, primarily

214
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,720
Platonism.

215
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,920
So in Platonism, I felt that I was an insider.

216
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,960
Not that I understood it that well,

217
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,000
but instinctively I was drawn to it.

218
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:50,440
And something within me assured me

219
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,720
that this must be the truth.

220
00:13:53,720 --> 00:14:00,400
And incidentally, Platonism doesn't stand alone.

221
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:08,280
It is inherently the same as the Vedic tradition.

222
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,160
There are certain differences.

223
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,600
But in essence, it is the same doctrine.

224
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:27,760
And as I said, the contemporary Weltanschauung,

225
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,400
which is regards particles of some kind or another

226
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:38,320
as a very basis from which everything else evolves,

227
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:47,480
that Weltanschauung is really nothing new at all.

228
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,680
As I said, it goes back to the Democritus.

229
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,720
And you might say it is one of the oldest heresies

230
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,520
in the history of human thought.

231
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,800
You're not a fan of atomistic thinking.

232
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,880
That's certainly what I got it from reading your book.

233
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:09,080
And you even go as far as to say that there are no,

234
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,560
that particles do not exist.

235
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:23,280
Yes, when you really pursue the Platonist metaphysics

236
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:32,440
and apply it to the contemporary panorama of physics

237
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,720
with its division between classical physics and quantum

238
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:44,200
physics, you find, and this came to me as an amazement,

239
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,880
you find that everything falls into place.

240
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,960
And you can, in fact, understand this division

241
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,760
between classical physics and quantum physics

242
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:05,080
in a brand new way, which finally makes sense.

243
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,800
I really like you to go deeper into that,

244
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,320
or at least explain your solution to this problem.

245
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,240
So if you can briefly state the problem,

246
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,320
and then your solution.

247
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:27,480
Yes, let me just say by way of introduction

248
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:33,680
that the Platonist metaphysics is, in a sense,

249
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:41,400
the diametric opposite of what contemporary intellectuals

250
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:47,080
believe, because contemporary intellectuals

251
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:52,440
believe that it all begins with atoms.

252
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:00,840
Nowadays, this is conceived evidently in quantum mechanical terms,

253
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:07,240
but metaphysically speaking, it's just atoms and the void,

254
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,840
very much as the democratus conceived of it.

255
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:18,240
It's the beginning of the fifth century BC.

256
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:25,520
So in a sense, you can say there's nothing new under the sun,

257
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:31,400
because stripped of its technical aspects,

258
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,280
the contemporary worldview is basically

259
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,160
democratus all over again.

260
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:49,800
And it is as much a heresy today as it was in the early days

261
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,640
of democratus.

262
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,200
In other words, it is simply false to say

263
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:03,760
that everything arises from particles.

264
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,800
There's no evidence to that effect.

265
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,600
People may think so, but if you dig into it a little bit more

266
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:20,160
deeply, you find that all these purported scenarios really

267
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,560
prove to be baseless.

268
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:30,600
And if you go into it with any kind of mathematical depths,

269
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:37,800
you find quickly enough that this contemporary scenario, which

270
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:44,440
tries to reduce everything to aggregates of particles,

271
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,280
actually proves to be impossible.

272
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,400
And in fact, it may interest many people

273
00:18:53,400 --> 00:19:02,200
to know that starting in the year 1998,

274
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,160
this philosophy, this Belt and Schoen,

275
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,680
has really been disproved.

276
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,240
It turns out to be mathematically impossible.

277
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,240
And it is very simple.

278
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,320
I think I can explain that in a few words,

279
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,640
comprehensible to the non-specialists.

280
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:40,280
If you start out with particles, then you need to talk about evolution.

281
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:45,440
You need to introduce this term, because somehow these particles

282
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,320
have to give rise to all that there is,

283
00:19:49,320 --> 00:20:01,760
beginning with the planetary system and the simplest organic structures.

284
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,560
So everything has to arise by way of quote unquote evolution.

285
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:13,120
This is the given, because obviously we live not in a world of particles,

286
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:21,520
but in a world of something which may conceivably reduce

287
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:29,600
an aggregate of particles, but it certainly is not what appears to us.

288
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:39,840
So what I'm trying to say is that if you base yourself on an ontology

289
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:46,400
of particles, then evolution is an absolute necessity

290
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,360
to go from these particles to the world which we inhabit.

291
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,160
Because the world which we inhabit is more than some of its parts.

292
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:02,600
It's also one of the things you seem to keep pressing on in this book of yours,

293
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:08,200
that there is an irreducible hole that you cannot take apart,

294
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:14,160
you cannot atomize it, and this is also one of the things you stress.

295
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:23,480
Yes, yes, I do stress this, but the point, Jack, is that

296
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:29,880
according to the contemporary scientific mindset,

297
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,280
everything does reduce to a sum of parts.

298
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,520
This is what our Weltanschauung insists upon.

299
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:44,000
Physics by its very modus operandi assumes this much.

300
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,920
The only reason physics can understand an object, whatever it may be,

301
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:56,600
is that object is a sum of parts, because that's how physics operates.

302
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,520
That's where differential equations come into the picture.

303
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:09,680
So our contemporary science is predicated upon this assumption

304
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:16,840
that the world consists of sums of parts.

305
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:23,880
And now I wanted to point out that it turns out,

306
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:30,120
and incidentally that's another way of introducing the idea of evolution.

307
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,840
It's the same thing.

308
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:39,040
If you start with particles, then the world and everything in it

309
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,200
is a result of evolution.

310
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,520
These parts come together to form holes,

311
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:52,600
and so you get ever more complicated aggregates of particles.

312
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:58,520
And this is the explanation of the world in which we find ourselves.

313
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:09,480
But it turns out that this basic premise is untenable.

314
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:17,240
And that is a direct consequence

315
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,760
over a rigorous mathematical theorem

316
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:32,560
proved in the year 1998 by an American mathematician named William Demsky.

317
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:38,080
And what Demsky proved is really very, very simple,

318
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:44,280
although the proof is not very simple, but the idea is very simple.

319
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:55,240
Demsky proved that if you have something sufficiently complicated,

320
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:03,000
then it becomes mathematically impossible to suppose

321
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:11,880
that this entity came about by chance.

322
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:21,200
If you have some stochastic random process like tossing a coin,

323
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:30,760
the likelihood that this will somehow spell out all the volumes

324
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,720
in the Library of Congress in their chronological order

325
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:41,680
is so small that it is rigorously impossible.

326
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:50,600
And this is what Demsky proved in this so-called intelligent design theorem,

327
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:57,800
which was published in a book in Cambridge University Press in 1998.

328
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:06,640
So what the theorem of Demsky affirms is that

329
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:13,800
a causality operating in time, which is a causality of physics,

330
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:21,640
cannot produce what is called complex specified information.

331
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,520
And with this causality, you specifically refer to horizontal causation.

332
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,640
Yes, so horizontal causation.

333
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,760
So when I saw this term for the first time, or this vertical causation,

334
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,080
and I've never heard of it before, immediately I thought,

335
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,080
okay, so what does Wolfgang mean?

336
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,640
Because by that point I had not read your book,

337
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:49,080
and I can imagine you have on the one hand a cause,

338
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,880
which leads to an effect, and that effect can be another cause.

339
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,760
And we imagine this, at least in the Western world,

340
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,760
because we do not have circular time in our Western thinking.

341
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,560
We have a linear time going,

342
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,320
and it usually is imagined from the left to the right.

343
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,560
So that seems to me the horizontal causation,

344
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,720
but you introduce an idea which is vertical causation,

345
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:18,480
which might explain some instant annuity.

346
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,960
Sorry, but I just wanted to...

347
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,040
You're absolutely right.

348
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:29,800
What Demsky's theorem affirms, to put it in my language,

349
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,480
is that horizontal causation,

350
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,280
the causation upon which physics is based,

351
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:41,680
cannot produce complex specified information.

352
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:48,000
And since even the simplest forms of life, an amoeba,

353
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,440
as it were, embodies huge quantities

354
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,360
of complex specified information,

355
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,680
it follows from Demsky's theorem that a natural process,

356
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,920
a process that physics can understand,

357
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:12,160
could not have formed that organic organism, that amoeba.

358
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:18,640
So the point that I'm making is that, actually,

359
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:25,600
with Demsky's theorem, evolution, as we normally conceive of it,

360
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,720
has become mathematically impossible.

361
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:42,720
And the fact that this basic discovery is very much suppressed,

362
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:52,160
this is not what you will learn at any reputable university.

363
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,920
There are no courses in Harvard or Princeton

364
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,920
that will tell you these things.

365
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:08,320
It shows that when it comes to Weltanschauung,

366
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:17,520
the matter is not based on pure simple logic.

367
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,720
I mean, we are human.

368
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,840
Ideology comes into play.

369
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:34,000
So as a general statement of what I discovered rather early in life,

370
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,960
is that our so-called scientific Weltanschauung,

371
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,440
which entails the idea, for example, of evolution and life

372
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,640
springing from the mental particles, ultimately,

373
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:55,480
that this is not a scientific fact.

374
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,400
There's no proof of this.

375
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:02,240
On the contrary, I've just said there are mathematical theorems

376
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,280
that disprove that possibility.

377
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:11,880
But the point is that our Weltanschauung, which claims to be scientific,

378
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:21,440
and if you will, objective is, in fact, ideology-driven.

379
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,040
I agree.

380
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,440
Yeah, Brian, go ahead.

381
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,560
I just wanted to add something.

382
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,000
Wolfgang uses the word Weltanschauung, which

383
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,720
is a German word that just means world view

384
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,680
or how one looks out upon the world.

385
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,000
But just going back to your question, Jack,

386
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,080
if I could reintroduce, you had the question

387
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,320
about the Wolfgang's resolution to the quantum enigma.

388
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,880
And Wolfgang, before you came across Dempke's theorem in 1998,

389
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,040
you wrote a book called The Quantum Enigma, Finding

390
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:56,960
the Hidden Key, in which you pick up on Heisenberg's description

391
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,480
of what quantum reality is.

392
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,000
And this is what leads you down the path to your resolution.

393
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,560
So maybe you could talk about where you picked up from Heisenberg

394
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:11,520
and how you came to this resolution.

395
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,020
All right.

396
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,200
Quantum theory was discovered in the early decades

397
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,560
of the 20th century.

398
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:37,400
And very soon after its discovery,

399
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:45,040
a problem confronted the physicists, which

400
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,520
they were unable to resolve.

401
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,960
And that is the following.

402
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,800
Quantum theory describes a physical system

403
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,400
by a so-called wave function.

404
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:04,000
And in that wave function description,

405
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,200
the physical systems behave in a very weird way.

406
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,760
Particles, for example, multilocate.

407
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:21,600
And you are in a realm totally different from the world

408
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:28,120
as we know it in our daily life.

409
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,920
But when you, for example, set up an experiment

410
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:40,440
to measure the position of this, say, multi-locating particle,

411
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,160
you find that at the instant of measurement,

412
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,680
the particle ceases to multi-locate

413
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:56,080
and actually presents itself at some particular location

414
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,920
in space.

415
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,840
And this, of course, is very puzzling.

416
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,920
How does this miracle arise?

417
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:14,080
That in an instant, a system completely changes

418
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,600
and becomes something that it was not before.

419
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,160
This is called the measurement problem.

420
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:30,200
And I became very interested in that problem.

421
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,400
It was about 1995, the abouts.

422
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:44,640
And I finally became convinced that I

423
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,680
see the one and only way to resolve it.

424
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:53,000
And I wrote a book to that effect on that subject

425
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:01,480
called the quantum enigma, where I start from the ground up

426
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:11,480
and develop the idea, ideas, actually two of them,

427
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,480
that are needed to resolve this problem.

428
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,520
And there are two ideas that you need.

429
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:27,680
The first idea is the fact that the perceptible world, which

430
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,040
is really the world in which we find ourselves,

431
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,880
happens not to be a quantum world.

432
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,400
It happens not to be even just the physical world.

433
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,320
So the world as a physicist conceives of it

434
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,560
is not the full world.

435
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,840
There's more.

436
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,360
And if there were not more, for example,

437
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,960
there could be no perception, there could be no life.

438
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,760
So I made the basic ontological distinction

439
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:04,280
between a corporeal entity and the physical entity.

440
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,880
Now a corporeal entity is a kind of entity

441
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,720
which we encounter in our normal daily life.

442
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,960
It's something that we perceive as our senses

443
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:26,720
and something that has a reality, transcending what

444
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:34,440
the physicist can describe in abstract mathematical terms.

445
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:40,640
Now every corporeal object X has associated with it

446
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,560
a physical object, call it Sx.

447
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,280
In other words, the physical object

448
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:56,880
that classical physics deals with are corporeal objects

449
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:01,280
as conceived by the physicist.

450
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,480
So there's a difference between the corporeal object

451
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:14,840
X and the object Sx, which is the physicist's conception

452
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,200
of a corporeal object.

453
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,880
I would say that the corporeal object will be not

454
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,560
reducible to each part.

455
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,160
And the physical object S, or at least an abstract object,

456
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:32,120
will be decomposable into parts the atomistic way.

457
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,160
Yes, you're absolutely right.

458
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,240
Only at this point in the quantum enigma,

459
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:45,400
I had not yet introduced this idea of irreducible wholeness.

460
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:50,840
I simply distinguished the object

461
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:56,800
that we know in daily life through our normal senses

462
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,640
from the corresponding physical object,

463
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,560
which is reduced.

464
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,800
It is limited by the physicist's assumptions.

465
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,480
So you have to distinguish these two objects.

466
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,880
They're not the same.

467
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,360
So there's a distinction between a corporeal object X

468
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:21,480
and the physicist's concept of that, which

469
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,680
I call the corresponding physical object.

470
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,120
But does its physical object actually exist,

471
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,080
or is it just an abstraction?

472
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,040
The abstraction of the corporeal objects.

473
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,720
It does exist.

474
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,800
I mean, the physicist does not deal with non-entities.

475
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
Yes, it has an existence.

476
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,440
The important thing is that you need

477
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,680
to distinguish between the two.

478
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,720
They're not the same thing.

479
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,200
And as long as you don't see that distinction,

480
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,160
you will not be able to solve the measuring problem.

481
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,920
And this is why this measuring problem has been kicked

482
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,800
around by top scientists, top physicists,

483
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,200
for close to 100 years now.

484
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:11,480
And actually, it has not been solved by these considerations.

485
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,400
Because in fact, it cannot be solved on that basis.

486
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,120
And the reason it cannot be solved on that basis

487
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:23,360
is that the crux of the matter is this distinction

488
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,320
between the corporeal entity X and the associated physical

489
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,640
entity Sx.

490
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,080
They're not the same.

491
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,480
The corporeal is more.

492
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,000
And it is this more that is the decisive factor

493
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,600
in the measurement problem.

494
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,760
And so I think physicists are still

495
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,280
thinking of the measurement problem.

496
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,360
The fact is that they cannot solve it

497
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,840
on the basis of physics.

498
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:02,880
So what I showed in this 1995 book, The Quantum Enigma,

499
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,120
is that in a sense, physics is limited.

500
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,600
It doesn't deal with everything.

501
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,640
And it is, in fact, so limited that it

502
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:20,320
is incapable of recognizing its own limitation.

503
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:26,360
The fact that the physicist's world is not the entire world,

504
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,400
that's a basic fact.

505
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,720
And unless you understand the basic facts,

506
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:38,560
you will not be able to correctly understand anything.

507
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,640
But this basic fact is invisible to physics,

508
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,920
by definition, if you will.

509
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,840
Could you say, I was going to ask Wolfgang,

510
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:53,360
could you say that Sx exists insofar as it participates in X

511
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,120
or partakes of X?

512
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:01,960
Yes, it derives its being from X.

513
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,520
And this is a major factor.

514
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,920
But this being that the physical object derives

515
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,000
from the corporeal is something entirely invisible

516
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,320
to the physicist.

517
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:22,880
Because in fact, being as such is invisible to the physicist,

518
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,680
because being is not a sum of parts.

519
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:33,200
And all the physicists can ever see is sums of parts.

520
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,000
That's why differential equations come into play,

521
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,960
because when you deal with things that do reduce the sum of parts,

522
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,280
these things then are amenable to study

523
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,120
by means of differential equations.

524
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,000
I used to always have trouble with the concept of something

525
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,760
being more than the sum of its parts,

526
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,080
until I heard an example by John Feveki.

527
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:07,360
He's, I think, a cognitive scientist, not sure.

528
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,840
And he gave the example of the Necker cube,

529
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,280
the two-dimensional drawing of a three-dimensional cube

530
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,640
in a wire frame.

531
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,120
And you can flip that inside and outside.

532
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,560
And he said, well, you have this two-dimensional drawing,

533
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,880
but the three-dimensional projection

534
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,000
you have in your head, that's the thing that is more

535
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,480
than the sum of its parts.

536
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,240
So only until then I kind of understood

537
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,520
what it really meant for something

538
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,360
to be more than the sum of its parts.

539
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,760
It's not something emergent, or there's

540
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,400
something that is not, you can't reduce the three-dimensional

541
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,200
image in your head to the lines on the paper.

542
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,040
And there has to be something more.

543
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,720
Anyway, I just wanted to add that.

544
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:56,560
Well, this example that John Feveki gave you

545
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,960
is very, very interesting and very fascinating.

546
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:06,200
But let me point out that it is not necessary to go to something

547
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,880
as high-falutely as this example,

548
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,760
because take, for example, any quality, say, color,

549
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,800
the color red.

550
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,120
The color red, obviously, is not a sum of parts

551
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,960
because it doesn't even have parts.

552
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,640
That's a good one.

553
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:37,960
It was Aristotle, really, who recognized

554
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,480
the difference between quantities and qualities.

555
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,480
And the point is that qualities are characterized

556
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,400
by the fact that they have no parts.

557
00:41:49,640 --> 00:42:08,920
So the upshot is that physics and our physical sciences deal

558
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:15,760
with a very limited aspect of reality.

559
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,560
And in fact, this is where its power comes from.

560
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:27,400
I always like to quote Goethe, who has said so many wise things.

561
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,080
And one of them is, quote, you understand it,

562
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,800
in the Beschränkung zeigt sich der Meister.

563
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:41,040
In limitation, the master shows himself.

564
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,080
So the point is that physics gains its power

565
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,440
through the enormity of its limitation.

566
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,480
And what is that limitation?

567
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:56,440
The limitation is that it will concentrate entirely

568
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,760
upon quantities.

569
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:05,600
The physicist has no eye for qualities.

570
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,440
He sees no color.

571
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,600
He sees nothing but quantities.

572
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,080
And therefore, he sees nothing but sums of parts.

573
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,120
This is an enormous limitation.

574
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,960
And it is the enormity of this limitation

575
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,960
that gives physics its equally enormous power.

576
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:35,520
So this, if I had any influence upon universities, which I don't,

577
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,440
this is what I would like to convey to the students,

578
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,040
because it makes for wisdom.

579
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:46,520
It makes for real understanding.

580
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:54,960
Our scientific Weltanschauung is bought at a cost.

581
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,920
We pay something to get that Weltanschauung.

582
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:06,080
And what we pay, in other words, what we lose in the process,

583
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:13,800
is the qualitative side of the world,

584
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:21,080
which we completely leave out of account

585
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,800
in our physical sciences.

586
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:35,600
So actually, if you want to be very precise, very rigorous,

587
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:45,880
you could say that there is no contemporary scientific Weltanschauung

588
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:52,120
for the simple reason that our sciences are based upon physics.

589
00:44:52,120 --> 00:45:00,640
And the physical world cannot really be looked upon at all.

590
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:07,440
The only way you can deal with it is through mathematical equations.

591
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:14,200
And so in order to make a Weltanschauung out of the findings of physics,

592
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:19,240
we have to add something to that,

593
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:25,160
which cannot in any way be based upon physics.

594
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:30,400
So in a sense, our contemporary Weltanschauung is a fake.

595
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,400
It is a fallacy.

596
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,880
It's a contradiction in terms,

597
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:40,720
because if the world were really what the physicist takes it to be,

598
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,960
that does not give rise to Weltanschauung.

599
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,920
This is nothing that you can tell the non-physicist,

600
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,720
aha, that's what the world is like,

601
00:45:53,720 --> 00:46:00,280
because all that remains basically are equations.

602
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:06,120
And the non-specialist doesn't understand these equations,

603
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:11,080
nor does it make any sense to say that in reality,

604
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,520
the world reduces to equations.

605
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,560
This is really nonsense.

606
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:21,440
And this is why I like the saying of Goethe so much,

607
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:33,520
because this Goethe's dictum really tells us why the physicist's Weltanschauung

608
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,040
is not a Weltanschauung at all,

609
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:41,640
unless he added something, an ingredient which is not part of physics,

610
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:46,640
he couldn't speak to the non-physicist.

611
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,240
Can I quote you from your book?

612
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,920
I just remind me of something you wrote.

613
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Please.

614
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Please.

615
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:00,200
You said that people today model along and don't even know anymore what is model

616
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:04,600
and what is fact, and it's something that I find is really a good quote.

617
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:09,000
It made me chuckle a bit.

618
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,080
I had the same thing when I was younger.

619
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:16,000
It almost feels like the scientific worldview,

620
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,560
which isn't actually a worldview,

621
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,800
but it pretends to be one, at least.

622
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,120
But it doesn't tell you it is.

623
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:30,160
I had to find out later that there is a distinction between modeling the world

624
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,800
or describing the world and the world in itself,

625
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,920
and the model of the world is not the same thing as the world.

626
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,960
And I can understand why people get confused, let's say,

627
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:45,800
and we need people like Wolfgang and other people

628
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:51,000
to reintroduce this classical idea, actually.

629
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
We seem to have forgotten that.

630
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
So I just wanted to add that.

631
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:09,480
Yes, as a result of this dominance of physical science in our time,

632
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:19,160
our intellectuals have become very, very confused.

633
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:25,800
And in these days of mass communication,

634
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,040
these ideas remain not only amongst the intellectuals.

635
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,960
It pervades our civilization.

636
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,360
I think nowadays, even in grade school,

637
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:43,640
we would give more information about atoms and particles and so on.

638
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:52,920
So we are very, very confused people, seriously confused.

639
00:48:52,920 --> 00:49:01,960
And it, of course, affects our entire civilization profoundly.

640
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:07,240
I mean, for example, the arts are profoundly affected

641
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:14,840
by this so-called scientific Weltanschauung,

642
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:18,760
which is, I have just tried to explain, is really a fake.

643
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:24,120
It is really a fake.

644
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:32,360
But these things are not easy to understand intellectually.

645
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:41,080
It requires certain qualifications, which are apparently quite rare.

646
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:51,160
And so the confusion remains and, in fact, perpetuates itself.

647
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:59,080
And it's getting worse and worse.

648
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,960
We are very, very confused people.

649
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:06,520
And it is affecting our culture as a whole.

650
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:15,720
And to the extent that one actually sees what is going on,

651
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:20,360
one cannot but be very worried.

652
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:29,240
Wolfgang, you introduced a concept as a correlation to horizontal causation,

653
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,520
it's vertical causation.

654
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:35,880
And you picked up on where Heisenberg said something about quantum particles,

655
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,760
that they're somewhere between being and non-being.

656
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,400
It has such a reminiscent of Aristotelian potentiae.

657
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,360
And this is something you picked up on.

658
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,760
And you said something interesting, you're quoted in your documentary,

659
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:51,000
saying that no one on either side of the Copenhagen debate

660
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,960
seemed to have realized that it was the role of quantum particles

661
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,160
not to bestow, but to receive being.

662
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:03,560
And so this plays into your idea of vertical causation,

663
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,640
which Jack had alluded to earlier.

664
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:11,560
Yeah. I want to respond to what you have just said, Brian,

665
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:17,720
because it touches upon something very, very major.

666
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:23,320
Heisenberg was a very, very unusual physicist.

667
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:32,280
He was different from all the other physicists by the fact that he was the son of a classicist.

668
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:39,480
His father was a classicist and Heisenberg himself was very

669
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:45,800
worth in, say, the philosophy of Plato, the philosophy of Aristotle.

670
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:55,080
He had a high degree of insight into these ancient doctrines.

671
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:59,560
And that set him off from the rest of the physicists.

672
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:10,600
And he was really alone among physicists to recognize that

673
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:18,600
these so-called quantum particles really had no being.

674
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:29,400
Physicists by and large regarded these particles as the ultimate building blocks of the world

675
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:41,160
when, in fact, Heisenberg, due to his knowledge of ancient philosophy,

676
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:48,520
recognized that they could not be that because, in fact, they lack being.

677
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:55,560
You cannot build a world out of things which don't exist, which don't have being.

678
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:04,360
So on the other hand, Heisenberg never managed to

679
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:16,360
take these recognitions all the way and build what might be called a complete

680
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:22,440
philosophy of physics, which puts everything in its right place.

681
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:34,840
He never managed to do that, but he did recognize the fact that quantum particles

682
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:42,760
are potentie, that means they don't really exist, but they are

683
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:49,480
material in relation to form.

684
00:53:51,480 --> 00:54:06,360
So I picked up, as it were, on this note and I recognized

685
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:19,000
very clearly that this is what the measurement problem is all about.

686
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:32,600
When you measure a quantum system, you give being to some entities which previously were mere

687
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:46,040
potency, and if a measuring instrument were itself a quantum system, you obviously couldn't do that.

688
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:59,960
Somewhere along the line, you need to bring into play some entities which have being

689
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:12,200
so that they can then affect the transition from the potency of a quantum particle

690
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:16,440
to the actuality of a measurement of a measured system.

691
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:33,240
So I realized that there is an ontological difference between an ordinary corporeal entity,

692
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:41,880
the kind of entities that we encounter in our conscious life, a chair, a table,

693
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:49,240
or anything that you can pick up, anything that you can actually perceive.

694
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:59,400
So these are corporeal entities and they are ontologically different from a mere quantum system,

695
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:04,520
because they do have, being a quantum system does not.

696
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:14,920
So based upon this very, very simple recognition, I found a very, very simple solution

697
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:23,080
to the so-called measurement problem. The point is, in order to measure a quantum system,

698
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:31,880
you need, which is a mere potency, a mere potency, you need something that is more than a potency

699
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:41,800
and these kind of entities are called corporeal entities. The chair I'm sitting on is corporeal,

700
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:54,120
otherwise I couldn't sit on it. So the first new idea that I introduced and that needs to be

701
00:56:54,120 --> 00:57:01,480
introduced, if you want to solve the measurement problem, is the distinction between a corporeal

702
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:10,520
entity and the associated physical entity, so the corporeal entity is more and this more

703
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:19,960
is essential in the act of measurement. But that was not enough in order to

704
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:39,320
to complete the argument, you need to recognize that if measurement is a transition from potency

705
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:53,560
to act, you need a corresponding causality, because the transition from potency to act

706
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:03,720
cannot take place in time, it can only be instantaneous, because there's nothing in between

707
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:14,600
the potency and act. So it is an instantaneous effect. Now physics deals with a causality,

708
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:23,000
which I call horizontal causality, which itself takes place in time. That's why you can write a

709
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:31,960
differential equation, because this is a causality which is really a process in time. But the causality

710
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:43,080
that you need in order to measure a quantum system cannot be a causality that takes place in time,

711
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:52,680
because as I said, it has to be instantaneous. And so this led to the discovery, if you will, of

712
00:58:53,240 --> 00:59:00,120
so-called vertical causation. Vertical causation is an entirely different kind of causation,

713
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:06,520
and it is characterized by the fact that it takes place instantaneously.

714
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:17,720
And so these are the two ontological ideas that I introduced in 1995,

715
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:29,800
in connection with the measurement problem. And let me just point out that it was very

716
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:38,520
interesting that three years later, exactly, William Demsky wrote his book on intelligent design,

717
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:46,120
in which he proved that theorem, which I have just mentioned, to the effect that it takes

718
00:59:47,000 --> 01:00:00,280
vertical causality to effect, to produce complex specified information. So I guess the time for

719
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:14,280
the discovery of vertical causality had come, because two independent books demonstrated

720
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:20,760
the need for that kind of causality. Where does that causality come from, this vertical causality?

721
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:25,880
Excuse me, Jack. Where does this vertical causality come from?

722
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:37,480
Ah, well, that is a wonderful question, because actually it turns out that you can have vertical

723
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:48,520
causality only in a Platonist cosmos. You need a cosmos as Plato himself conceived of it,

724
01:00:49,720 --> 01:01:02,840
because the Platonist cosmos is inherently tripartite. It consists of three levels, if you will,

725
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:11,160
in which the first level, the highest level, what Plato called the intelligible,

726
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:30,440
is not subject to either space or time. And it is this intelligible, I call it,

727
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:35,800
eternal level from which vertical causation emanates.

728
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:41,640
Can you please help me with the word eternal? My spellchecker keeps telling me this word doesn't

729
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:46,680
exist, and I was just curious. I've never come across it. I think it's a beautiful word, but it's it.

730
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:58,600
Well, the word goes back to the Christian middle ages, where

731
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:15,320
the scholastic philosophers recognized that there is a level in the cosmos

732
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:29,480
beyond space and time. So then your question is, what is it that distinguishes this kind of eternity

733
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:38,680
from what theologians want to call eternity? And the answer was given by Thomas Aquinas,

734
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:58,360
who said that the eternal realm is not subject to time, but time can be added onto it.

735
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:09,320
These are the words. That means, even though eternity has no time,

736
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:21,320
it is really part of a cosmos in which time does exist. So it's a very sharp distinction,

737
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:31,160
but very, very essential from a metaphysical point of view, because the eternity of the

738
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:43,720
highest cosmic sphere is not to be equated to the eternity that, properly speaking, belongs to

739
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:54,680
God himself, who is the creator of the world. So the eternity of God is more than the eternity

740
01:03:55,320 --> 01:04:05,480
of the highest cosmic sphere. Right, and this is where the this eternity is, where the vertical

741
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:15,640
causation comes from. Exactly. The vertical causation in so far as it does not happen in time,

742
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:27,640
it therefore comes from the eternal plane. It emanates, let's say. It doesn't emerge.

743
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:30,920
Emanates, is there any metaphor we can use for this?

744
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:44,120
There really is not, because here we are dealing with the deepest metaphysical problems,

745
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:53,560
which being basic cannot be further reduced, so to speak. Fair enough.

746
01:04:54,280 --> 01:05:09,560
So after writing this book on the quantum enigma, I began to realize that the key

747
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:21,640
to all these metaphysical questions relating to the nature of physics and the physical world

748
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:30,760
need to be resolved on a Platonist basis. I've always instinctively been a Platonist,

749
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:39,320
but it was after this rather intense work I put in on the quantum enigma,

750
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:47,560
that it became more clear to me than ever before that in order to understand physics,

751
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:56,680
we need to go back to the Platonist philosophy. This is really the key, this is the right way

752
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:06,360
of doing it, and let me say that in light of my latest book, where I actually carry out,

753
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:23,240
if you will, that plan, I am very gratified and in a way amazed to see that if you look at physics

754
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:30,760
from a rigorous Platonist point of view, everything becomes very, very simple.

755
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:40,200
And not only does it become very, very simple, but you also at the same time realize

756
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:50,600
that the actual story is the very opposite of what physicists nowadays believe. It's

757
01:06:50,600 --> 01:07:00,280
the very opposite because basically physicists start with particles and then they want to

758
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:12,520
from particles step by step build a universe. And it turns out from the Platonist point of view

759
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:22,600
that I've just alluded to, that the true story is just the other way around. Particles come at

760
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:31,960
the very end and they even have no being. So the real anthology starts from just the opposite

761
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:38,200
direction. The true anthology is top down, it is not bottom up.

762
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:48,760
Interesting. Wolfgang, if I could ask a question, you introduced a reminder that it was reported,

763
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:55,080
reportedly said or written above the Platonic Academy at Athens, let no one ignorant of geometry

764
01:07:55,080 --> 01:08:03,480
enter here. And I think this informed your concept of the tripartite cosmos and a tripartite man.

765
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:13,560
And it takes shape of an icon of a circle with a center point. And would it be fair to characterize

766
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:22,440
this icon reflecting the human person, let's say, or any created entity? Well, in particular,

767
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:27,320
you introduced the intellect, the idea of the intellect. So you reintroduced a distinction

768
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:35,560
between the intellect and reason and then the corporeal. The intellect is instantaneous. It's

769
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:43,000
not constrained by time or space and it's how we perceive things. And this is, you did quite a

770
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,720
bit of research into James J. Gibson's theory of ecological perception which supported this.

771
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:52,920
And then there's the distinction between the intellectual moving into the rational, which is

772
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:59,560
discursive thought that takes place in time but requires no space. And then being terminates on

773
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:05,480
the level of the corporeal, let's say, where the person manifests him or herself in space and time.

774
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:09,240
And so each person has these three aspects to their nature, the intelligible,

775
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:13,800
they have access to this where there's no space, no time, they have access to the

776
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:20,360
reason and the rational discursive thought in time, no space, and the corporeal. So maybe

777
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:27,560
I know Jack was interested in your research on James J. Gibson and how this ties into that concept.

778
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:41,400
Well, you raise a very fundamental question. I think the first thing that I should point out is that

779
01:09:42,280 --> 01:10:01,480
it is very enlightening to associate the Platonist doctrine of the three levels of the cosmos

780
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:10,040
with the bounds of space and time. And incidentally, I don't see this

781
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:18,360
talked about in the Platonist philosophy.

782
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:26,600
They must have known it because they were very wise and this is very basic,

783
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:36,600
but I don't find it written about, say, in the Timaeus or the other relevant dialogues.

784
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:48,920
The point is this. Platonism distinguishes three levels of the cosmos. The supreme level,

785
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:58,520
which is beyond time, is called the intelligible, I call it the eternal.

786
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:09,800
The second level, which the Platonists call the psychic or the vital, I call it the intermediary.

787
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:18,680
The second level, I say, and this I do not find explicitly in the Platonist dialogues,

788
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:29,080
the second level is subject to time but not to space. So the intermediary level, which is a psychic,

789
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:38,760
is subject to time but not to space. And then, of course, as you would expect,

790
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:48,520
the third or lowest, what we call the corporeal level, is subject to both time and space.

791
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:57,800
So you have these three levels of the cosmos and you can, if you will, define them in terms of the

792
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:05,480
two bounds, time and space. There is a level that is subject to neither, there's a level that is

793
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:11,640
subject to time but not to space, and then there's a level that is subject to both. So this is very

794
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:30,600
simple. And amazing consequences fall there and so from this way of looking at the matter.

795
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:44,680
And I think perhaps the one that will interest our listeners the most is the fact that the existence

796
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:56,120
of a time-only level of the cosmos, the existence of what I call the intermediary plane,

797
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:07,720
in itself disproves or disqualifies Einstein and relativity. Einstein and relativity, which

798
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:21,400
it is, were fuses space and time in what is called spacetime. If Einstein were right,

799
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:32,440
there could be no cosmic realm, subject to time but not to space, because space and time are,

800
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:45,640
so to speak, two different aspects of a spacetime, which includes both. So one of the obviously

801
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:59,640
most interesting consequences of this recognition of the Platonist ontology as affirming an intermediary

802
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:08,120
realm, subject to time alone, one most amazing consequences of this is that it disqualifies

803
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:22,520
Einstein and relativity at a single scale. So sorry, and sometimes I agree.

804
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:29,320
Well, that was something I would like to, before I forget, I didn't have many questions, but there

805
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:36,680
was a paper you mentioned by J. Gibson. I just mentioned it yourself too, and I haven't read

806
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:47,000
papers simply because I'm not really good at reading papers, but I hope you can summarize the

807
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:53,960
general idea behind it, because all I understand from it is that we see reality how it is.

808
01:14:55,080 --> 01:15:02,280
That's what I read in your book or in the key points, that we see reality as it is.

809
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:09,960
What does Gibson mean by that? Well, I'm so glad you brought up the name of James Gibson,

810
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:19,640
because I really think he is one of the absolutely most important scientists of the 20th century,

811
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:34,440
because he has single-handedly corrected a major mistake of post-Cartesian science

812
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:47,720
by rediscovering the fact that in visual perception, what you actually perceive

813
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:59,080
is not inside the head, it's in the external world itself. We do perceive mountains and trees,

814
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:08,440
and we do perceive color. So in my language, what we perceive is exactly the corporeal world

815
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:21,240
as distinguished from the physical. It is an amazing achievement on the part of Gibson

816
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:32,040
to have actually formulated in rigorous empirical terms a theory of visual perception,

817
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:40,600
which completely breaks with the so-called retinal image theory, which as we know,

818
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:48,600
think of perception as a process originating in the retina. These

819
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:57,880
rods and cones are stimulated by light impinging upon the retina, and so then there are nerve

820
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:09,000
currents set up into the cortex, and a very, very complicated process ensues in which

821
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:19,160
involves something on the order of 20 or 21 visual centers in the cortex, and libraries have been

822
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:29,720
filled with the product of that research. But the fact of the matter is that

823
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:42,440
when all is said and done, we can just trace the process of seeing, the process of visual perception

824
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:50,440
to a bunch of visual centers in the cortex, none of which actually

825
01:17:51,320 --> 01:18:03,720
contains that image that we see. And so it turns out that

826
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:15,880
the so-called retinal image theory of visual perception doesn't really lead to perception.

827
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:24,520
It leads in a sense to the very opposite in the sense that these different visual centers

828
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:33,560
take the image apart, and as Sir Francis Crick said famously, we see how the image,

829
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:42,520
how the brain takes the image apart. We do not yet see how the brain puts the picture back together

830
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:51,080
again, and the obvious fact is that the brain does not put the picture back together again.

831
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:59,800
In fact, it can't. And the fact that it can't has come to be known as a so-called binding problem.

832
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:10,600
The problem is you've got, say, a million neurons in these visual centers of the brain,

833
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:24,120
and as a result of light striking the retina, these are in various modes of on and off position.

834
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:33,800
How do you make a picture out of this vast multiplicity of neuronal states?

835
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:41,400
And in other words, how does the brain put the picture back together again?

836
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:49,080
And the answer quite obviously is the brain can do no such thing. And so this has become known

837
01:19:49,800 --> 01:20:02,440
in the world of, this has become known as the binding problem. And the fact of the matter is

838
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:15,400
that the binding problem really has no solution on a neuronal basis. The neurons

839
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:21,880
take the picture apart, they do not, they cannot put it back together again. And so

840
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:37,400
at one point, I simply stated the obvious fact that the binding problem cannot be

841
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:47,800
solved on the corporeal level. In other words, the only way the binding problem can solve,

842
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:55,880
can be solved, the way it is solved, is that in our integral being, we are not

843
01:20:56,440 --> 01:21:03,800
subject to the condition of space. In our corporeal nature, yes, on that level,

844
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:12,680
we are subject to the condition of space. And this is where all that neurophysiology takes place.

845
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:21,480
But the actual binding takes place on the next level up, which is the level of the

846
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:30,200
intermediary or psychic plane. So the answer to the binding problem is this,

847
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:36,520
it is resolved not on the corporeal level, but on the psychic.

848
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:47,240
So if we were purely corporeal creatures, we could not see anything. There could be no perception.

849
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:55,320
And incidentally, so we have these three levels of the cosmos, the

850
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:06,120
intelligible, the psychic and the corporeal. And I just want to point out that in days gone by,

851
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:14,440
every child really knew that the human being himself

852
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:32,840
consists of three levels. In Latin, it's anima, soul, psyche, mind, and intellect or spiritus.

853
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:42,040
So corpus anima spiritus, this trichotomy of man, is simply, simply

854
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:52,680
tells us that man is a microcosm. Man is the cosmos in miniature. So even as the cosmos is

855
01:22:52,680 --> 01:23:02,600
tripartite, the anthropos is also tripartite. And if we were not tripartite, for example,

856
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:10,600
visual perception would be impossible. And this is what has now baffled

857
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:19,000
the neurophysiologists. This is the binding problem which no one has solved. And no one

858
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:28,440
can solve on the corporeal level. The binding problem would be impossible to solve if it were

859
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:39,320
not for the fact that man is more than a body. Man has not only a body, he has also a soul.

860
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:47,480
And then there's the third component, above soul there is spiritus. And we need all three,

861
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:55,720
actually it turns out, excuse me, it turns out that in addition to the intermediary,

862
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:06,840
the eternal level in man is also needed for ordinary perception, because there could be no

863
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:13,240
perception of motion. If you think about it deeply, the perception of motion

864
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:20,200
is possible only because within man there is a level above time itself.

865
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:32,200
So if we were completely immersed in time, we could not perceive motion.

866
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:40,920
And this is what Gibson discovered, didn't he, is that perception didn't take place as a series of

867
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:49,480
points in time, but was required constant motion and was instantaneous. Yes. The point about Gibson

868
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:57,080
is that he was all empiricists. He was one of the greatest empiricists, I think the world has ever

869
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:06,520
seen, but he was not a metaphysician. And when you read his papers, he expresses himself

870
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:15,720
in purely empiricist terms. He won't talk to you about, he doesn't write about

871
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:27,240
matter and form or a psychic realm subject to time and not to space. This is not the language he

872
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:40,760
uses. He was an empiricist of absolutely first rank. I'm very happy that he has been recognized and

873
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:49,080
acknowledged. I think the academic community has honored him and made him a member of the

874
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:57,080
Academy of Science and so on. They have greatly honored him. And I think they have done so

875
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:05,160
because they have not recognized how dangerous he is to everything that they stand for.

876
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:13,240
Because if they would really understand Gibson, they would realize, to quote my friend Alexander

877
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:24,440
Unziger, they would realize that for 30 years they've been talking nonsense. Because he destroyed

878
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:43,000
that materialist ontology, which underlies our academic sciences as the assumption that nobody

879
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:50,440
really wants to talk about. You assume it, it is not talked about. I think this is a good place to

880
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:57,160
end it here. Well, unless you want to go on. I mean, I don't want to text you too much.

881
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:10,360
As you know, from reading this latest book of mine, I have still many things, basic things to say,

882
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:20,360
but I'm happy to end at any point that you, I still have some energy left in me.

883
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:28,200
If you can go, we'll just go on. I just, I want to be considerate here. Because

884
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:37,720
then we just will go on a little bit. We'll see how far we can go. The reason I asked for Gibson,

885
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:43,560
for your explanation of Gibson's argument, because I wasn't necessarily familiar with it,

886
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:50,520
is we also had on Donald Hoffman, and he's a mathematician, and he said, well, he said the

887
01:27:50,520 --> 01:28:01,160
opposite. But now that I heard your argument, I'm not sure if that's just, I'm not sure if it's

888
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:06,760
just semantics or not, because his argument was that we almost certainly do not see reality

889
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:16,520
as it is. But that argument was based on evolution. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Donald Hoffman.

890
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:27,880
Well, let me tell you quite frankly, that I'm not familiar with most of the contemporary

891
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:35,960
thinkers who have made a name for themselves, because as you can see from what has already

892
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:48,120
transpired in our conversation, I stand really on the opposite pole of the contemporary worldview.

893
01:28:48,760 --> 01:29:04,520
I'm a Platonist. I've always been a Platonist. And the older I get, the more deeply I value

894
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:17,320
Plato. And the more instinctively I look upon our issues from a Platonist point of view. And this

895
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:30,920
point of view is quite evidently the very opposite of the modern or contemporary way of looking at

896
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:42,440
things. The contemporary way of looking at things is basically Democratian. From a Platonist point

897
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:52,440
of view, we're repeating the Democratian heresy. And in a way, priding ourselves on that.

898
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:59,800
The point being that we are trying to understand

899
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:10,440
complex things, corporeal things and mental things, except being something

900
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:19,960
supramental, that too, we're trying to understand everything on the basis of atoms and the void.

901
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:28,680
In other words, in modern terms, this would be quantum particles. And I think it already emerges

902
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:41,560
from what we have been talking about this morning, that you do not understand anything ontologically

903
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:51,400
if you imagine that things reduce the quantum particles. Because in point of fact, quantum

904
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:58,440
particles have no being. They're not really there. They are near potences. And obviously,

905
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:11,880
the universe is not a potency, but an actuality. So from my Platonist point of view, contemporary

906
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:24,520
thought regarding the nature of cosmic reality is upside down. We are standing upside down. We

907
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:33,960
are trying to understand actuality in terms of potency. And it's a hopeless process.

908
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:43,320
And so I have read comparatively few contemporary authors. And the only

909
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:51,480
contemporary authors that I've really read with great interest, like, for example, James Gibson,

910
01:31:52,040 --> 01:32:02,840
is due to the fact that he opposes the contemporary point of view. Gibson interests me so enormously.

911
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:09,320
Because he says the opposite of most other cognitive psychologists.

912
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:17,880
Wolfgang, what could you say specifically that Gibson discovered about perception, meaning

913
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:24,520
what was it about the nature of perception that was so distinct from the retinal image version?

914
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:34,680
Well, he discovered something that practically no one in the contemporary scientific world

915
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:44,680
was prepared to believe. Namely, that what we see in visual perception is not inside the head,

916
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:55,320
it's outside. We actually perceive a mountain or a rose. If the rose is red, we actually perceive

917
01:32:55,320 --> 01:33:03,720
that redness in the rose. This is what, of course, the ancients believed. This was in Plato's day,

918
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:12,840
everyone would have agreed. But it goes completely contrary to everything that the

919
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:21,240
Western intelligentsia has believed since the days of René Descartes. And so

920
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:31,320
it comes as an enormous shock, or should come as an enormous shock to the educated world of our day,

921
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:40,280
that someone like Gibson has made these discoveries, and in a way which cannot really be refuted.

922
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:48,280
You introduced René Descartes, and one of the topics that you like to talk about is the notion

923
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:55,240
of bifurcation, which was a term coined by Alfred North Whitehead to describe Descartes' bifurcated

924
01:33:55,240 --> 01:34:01,560
world between thought and extension. And I have a feeling that that plays a role in, let's say,

925
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:11,160
Professor Hoffman's conception of perceiving the world as conjecture in our mind as opposed to the

926
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:23,960
world as it is. Yeah, I'm glad, Brian, that you brought up the idea of bifurcation, because it is

927
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:38,120
really very, very basic. Descartes introduced it in the 17th century, and it is simply the postulate

928
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:53,560
that the world, the realm of existing things splits into two categories. There is the first

929
01:34:53,560 --> 01:35:03,080
category is what he calls res extensé, which means extended entities. And these are entities which

930
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:21,080
exist in space, and they have no other attributes than the fact that they exist in space and time.

931
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:35,720
Everything that is not a res extensor is what Descartes calls a res cogitans, which means a thing of

932
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:46,040
the mind. So having split the entire universe into extended entities on one side and mental entities

933
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:58,520
on the other, he has set the world up, ideally for the mathematical physicists, because it tells

934
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:05,640
the mathematical physicists that the real world, the world that exists outside and not inside the head,

935
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:16,040
consists of only extended entities. So this suggested to Sir Isaac Newton and to physicists

936
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:24,120
really ever after, that the real world is precisely the world as the physicists concede of it.

937
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:32,040
These are the things that can be described in mathematical terms.

938
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:42,360
It began in a crude way with mechanisms that are somewhat like a clockwork. And you remember

939
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:49,800
in the 17th century, in fact, they built these mechanisms. You see them in Venice.

940
01:36:54,200 --> 01:37:00,200
And they built them because they really thought that that's what the real world is like. It's a

941
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:11,800
world of cogs and wheels interacting mechanically. And so the physicists were delighted because Descartes

942
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:23,800
left them with an exterior so-called external world of the kind that really is made for

943
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:32,840
mathematical analysis. It's ideal. The physicist was in his paradise. And however,

944
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:49,800
it turns out that by reducing the external world to res extensé, making out of it a kind of clockwork

945
01:37:49,800 --> 01:38:06,040
universe, Descartes misrepresented the external world. He oversimplified it. And we have been

946
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:15,720
paying the price ever since. Now, this Cartesian dichotomy into res extensé and res cogitantes

947
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:23,800
has become, so to speak, second nature among physicists.

948
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:35,720
Every physicist learns this bifurcationist outlook very early in life. And then he

949
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:48,600
learns it so deeply and so naturally that he doesn't recognize it as a postulate.

950
01:38:50,600 --> 01:39:01,080
Most physicists, it turns out, are really incapable of grasping bifurcation as a philosophical

951
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:08,200
axiom, an assumption which may or may not be true. And so it was Alfred North Whitehead

952
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:17,080
who coined that term bifurcation. And then he went to all the finest universities in

953
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:28,840
the UK and in the States, lecturing physicists about this assumption that unwittingly they

954
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:36,200
have made. And he pointed out to them that it has created an incredible model.

955
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:44,680
And in the hope of waking them up as it were, but the fact of the matter is that

956
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:53,320
it's uncertain whether there exists even one famous physicist who is not

957
01:39:54,040 --> 01:40:05,160
instinctively bifurcationist. So bifurcation is then a metaphysical axiom which physicists

958
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:14,920
almost without exception or perhaps actually without exception believe in. Now, the important

959
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:25,640
thing is that bifurcation is ultimately untenable. It is not true. It is a metaphysical error.

960
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:32,920
And in a sense, we know that since the days of Democritus, because in a sense,

961
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:43,800
Democritus is the first philosopher in history to introduce bifurcation into the

962
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:58,120
into philosophical discourse. So the upshot of the matter is that physics,

963
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:10,840
as it is understood in our day, is bound up with this axiom of bifurcation, which it assumes

964
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:23,880
rigidly. And once you have assumed that axiom, you are committed to a kind of crude materialism,

965
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:33,240
which cannot possibly be true. It's an error that invalidates your wealth and show.

966
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:42,200
In fact, Heisenberg spoke about it as well, didn't he? He wrote about it. I had a quote here,

967
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:48,760
and he wrote, if one follows with great difficulty, which even eminent scientists like

968
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:53,720
Einstein have an understanding in accepting the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory

969
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:59,080
one can trace the roots of that difficulty to the Cartesian partition. And he goes on to say

970
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:04,200
that this partition has penetrated deeply into the human mind during the three centuries following

971
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:09,000
Descartes, and it will take a long time for it to be replaced by a really different attitude

972
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:13,160
toward the reality problem. That was from Heisenberg, which might come as a surprise to me.

973
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:22,920
The interesting thing about Heisenberg is that here and there in his writings,

974
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:33,480
you will find passages like the one that you just read. But I've made a rather thorough study of

975
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:39,320
Heisenberg because I regard him as among all the physicists, he was the most enlightened

976
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:49,000
metaphysically far more than anyone else that I can name. But the fact of the matter is that

977
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:59,640
there are other passages, you can quote in the writings of Werner Heisenberg,

978
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:09,960
where he is in fact placing himself on a bifurcationist basis. So he was not completely,

979
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:21,560
he was far more enlightened metaphysically than any other well-known physicist of our time.

980
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:33,800
And I say this is due to the fact that he was a son of a classicist. Through his father, he came to

981
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:45,640
know Platonism and philosophy of Aristotle and so forth. But he was not altogether consistent.

982
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:51,480
And I think if he had

983
01:43:55,960 --> 01:44:08,280
comprehended non-bifurcation more deeply, he would have resolved the

984
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:18,520
leading problems in the philosophy of physics, which he did not actually resolve.

985
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:29,640
He gives us clues, occasionally very perceptive clues, but he did not carry through to solve.

986
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:35,160
For example, he did not give us a solution of the measurement problem.

987
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:48,920
The so-called Copenhagen rule, which he and Niels Bohr proposed, was a way, gave us a way of doing

988
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:59,480
physics without getting into trouble. But the reason for the Copenhagen cut is something

989
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:10,920
that he never articulated explicitly, which he could have based upon the recognition that bifurcation

990
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:23,960
is false. I have a question from the audience. When I read your book, you seem to have a lot of

991
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:29,480
quote from Unsikker. Unsikker, I'm not sure how you pronounce it. How do you pronounce it?

992
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:38,920
Unsikker. Unsikker. Okay. And Ben Moffo asks, what does Dr. Smith think of Unsikker's variable

993
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:49,080
light speed theory? Well, Unsikker is a great admirer of Albert Einstein. In fact, in his

994
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:59,640
recent book, just published a short while ago, he goes into the Einsteinian physics in a very

995
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:09,960
interesting way. And it clearly reveals that he regards Einsteinian physics as the key to a deeper

996
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:18,360
understanding of the subject. And so on this point, Alexander Unsikker and I are completely on

997
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:26,600
opposite sides of the issue. I regard Einsteinian physics as fundamentally misconceived.

998
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:40,760
The reason that this is not universally known or accepted resides in the fact that

999
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:55,320
Einsteinian physics differs from classical physics, mathematically, by a square root for one minus

1000
01:46:55,320 --> 01:47:04,200
v squared over c squared, where b is the velocity of the system of the object that you are speaking

1001
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:14,120
about. And c is the velocity of light. Now, since the speed of light is about 300,000 kilometers per

1002
01:47:14,120 --> 01:47:25,320
second, one minus v squared over c squared is so incredibly close to one, unless you get up to speeds

1003
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:32,760
which approach the speed of light, which is very hard to do in an empirical setting.

1004
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:44,760
So on account of this fact, the deviation between Einsteinian physics and non-Einsteinian physics

1005
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:56,360
is so small as to be practically unmeasurable. There is one, what is regarded as an Einsteinian

1006
01:47:56,360 --> 01:48:07,720
formula, which is not covered by this observation. And that is a formula E equals mc squared,

1007
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:19,880
called the atom bomb formula. Now, it is true that Einstein derived this formula from his 1905

1008
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:31,000
paper. What is generally unknown, even among physicists, is the fact that the formula E equals

1009
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:39,560
mc squared can also be derived from classical physics. In a word, it has nothing to do with

1010
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:49,800
relativity. And this is one of the reasons why Einsteinian physics has been just about

1011
01:48:49,800 --> 01:49:01,080
universally accepted, is because if you regard E for mc squared to be a relativistic formula,

1012
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:07,880
well, that certainly and unfortunately has proved itself to be absolutely correct.

1013
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:11,560
So what I'm saying is that

1014
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:27,560
Einsteinian physics has not really passed the empirical test. People think it has, but

1015
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:35,480
if you actually go into the details, about 50 different experiments that can be listed,

1016
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:43,960
which were designed to test relativistic effects, not one of them really stands up,

1017
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:54,760
understood the name. And the exception, the parent exception, the E equals mc squared formula,

1018
01:49:55,720 --> 01:50:03,000
that does stand up on the scrutiny, but it has nothing to do with relativity theory at all.

1019
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:16,520
It can equally well be derived from classical physics. So therefore, I believe that our present

1020
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:25,080
addiction, if you will, to Einsteinian physics is misconceived. And I think the time will come,

1021
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:34,120
perhaps very soon, when this will come to light, and Einstein will be discredited.

1022
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:42,440
Right. But this person was asking about variable light speed, or at least the variable light speed

1023
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:49,480
theory. I'm not acquainted with the theory, but I'm imagining that light can go different speeds,

1024
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:52,040
and that would probably solve some problems.

1025
01:50:55,160 --> 01:51:09,720
Yes, I'm not an expert on these things at all. I have done some inquiry into Einsteinian physics,

1026
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:17,240
because for various reasons, this has interested me a lot. And I did, as I have just indicated,

1027
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:31,160
come to the conclusion that the theory has been accepted on spurious grounds, that a lot of

1028
01:51:31,160 --> 01:51:40,520
ideology enters into it. It's a very complicated story. I would love to read a book,

1029
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:47,960
which has not yet been written, which, so to speak, gives the inside story of what stands behind

1030
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:53,720
Einsteinian physics and that fascination, that love affair, if you will, that we've had with

1031
01:51:53,720 --> 01:52:01,400
Einsteinian physics. I'd be very interested to know more about that. All I know is that

1032
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:13,720
there has been a lot of misconception on this subject, and in particular, I do disagree with

1033
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:21,880
Alexander Unziger on this point. Fair enough. I don't have, it's not a question, but a statement

1034
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:28,440
someone made. Could be me, he said, many of the comments Dr. Smith has made and his attention to

1035
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:35,720
Plato seems to align with ideas we hear from John Furveki. Well, could be me, there is a,

1036
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:42,280
as far as Dr. Smith has done an interview with John Furveki, at least one, I think, right?

1037
01:52:42,280 --> 01:52:47,880
I've had two conversations with him, yeah. Well, there you go. So, if you're listening,

1038
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:53,880
check it out. They're probably very, very good. John Furveki is an excellent speaker,

1039
01:52:54,440 --> 01:53:01,160
very creative mind. I love the dear doctor. Very pleased when I saw that one. I was like,

1040
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:05,240
okay, there's got to be some interesting things in there. Yeah.

1041
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:17,160
Yes, he's a very, very erudite man and a very deep thinker. And I think what I admire most

1042
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:26,760
is truly a seeker of truth. Truth is important to him. Not for any ulterior motive, but

1043
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:32,200
it is important because it should be important. What is more important than truth?

1044
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:42,680
Should we end it here? This way has been, we have been going on for two hours already.

1045
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:49,720
And my voice is, I've actually been sick as a dog and I'm trying not to cough.

1046
01:53:50,440 --> 01:53:55,240
And what is acting up right now? So, I think for my own sake, I have to stop this time.

1047
01:53:56,360 --> 01:54:04,520
Well, I thank you so much, Jack, for this interview. I'm very happy to have had an

1048
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:11,400
opportunity to discuss these matters because I think they are very, very important.

1049
01:54:13,640 --> 01:54:24,600
Important in a very broad sense. I think our civilization is, has been under the influence

1050
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:35,240
of certain materialist conceptions which prove not to be true. And I think it is very,

1051
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:44,360
very important that these things be rectified. And I think your program is doing a lot of good in

1052
01:54:44,360 --> 01:54:52,120
the sense that it is helping to bring clarity into these issues. All right, thank you. I really hope

1053
01:54:52,120 --> 01:55:03,720
so. And thank you so much for having the stamina to talk for two hours. Brian, thank you for joining

1054
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:12,600
us for helping me. Anybody who is listening, thank you too for your comments and for listening.

1055
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:19,480
I wish you all a very good night and I will see you guys the next time. Good night.

1056
01:55:21,240 --> 01:55:29,400
Thank you and alles Gute. Thanks, Jack. And Jack, if you ever go to visit Wolfgang, you can,

1057
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:33,640
you better have more stamina than that because he'll go to three in the morning.

1058
01:55:34,120 --> 01:55:41,240
Oh, that's good to know. I did not expect this. I did not expect this, honestly. Okay, guys.

1059
01:55:41,240 --> 01:55:48,120
It was a good conversation. Good night. Good night. Good night. Thank you so much.
