00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
Hello! My name is Morgan, and I am a fifth year PhD candidate in theater and performance studies.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,320
And when I started my PhD program, I quickly realized that the way I was taking notes in

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,520
undergrad just wasn't going to cut it for this new program. So I started looking into

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,720
different methods of note-taking that might help me out in my PhD. And specifically what I needed

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,720
was a way to store huge amounts of information so that it was easily accessible at a later date

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,440
when I needed it to write a paper. And preferably all of that information would be

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,440
fully interconnected with all of my other knowledge so that I can make surprising connections between

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,200
my thoughts and turn them into creative and critical thinking within my papers. And especially

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:52,080
within my dissertation. But that is kind of a big ask for a note-taking method to do.

10
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,880
And what I was doing in my undergrad was just highlighting quotes in books and writing in

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:03,120
the margins, and I would take notes on notebooks. And yes, I would organize those notes kind of with

12
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,440
a table of contents, marking where each thing was in each book. But then when I actually went to

13
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,840
write a paper, I would have like a stack of five notebooks. I would have to be flipping through to

14
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,800
see if I had written down the thought that I wanted to use for that paper. But I couldn't even fully

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,200
remember when and where I learned that thought. And the only organizational method was when and

16
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,520
where I learned that thought because, you know, it was organized by the courses I was taking,

17
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,120
not by logically where that information belongs in my brain. So I had a bit of a problem.

18
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,200
And whenever I went onto YouTube, say, to look for a tutorial on how to take better notes,

19
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,480
it wouldn't be a holistic system of how to like store and organize those notes. And I now realize

20
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,520
the piece that I was missing was a knowledge management system. And I am so happy to tell you

21
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,720
that I have found a method that works for me and I hope it will work for you too because it is the

22
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,960
method I'm going to be sharing in this video. The system I'm going to be teaching you today and

23
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,320
then walking you through how I use it is called the Zettelkasten method. And this was originally

24
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,400
used by Nicholas Lumen in the 1960s. And we are at an even greater advantage than Lumen was because

25
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:14,320
we have computers. And there are so many softwares online that you can download to your computer and

26
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,600
do all of the work of connecting your thought for you. Personally, the software I use is called

27
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,920
Obsidian, but there's many other choices out there. So find one that works for you. I think

28
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,560
that the Zettelkasten makes taking and storing notes and learning things actually like fun and

29
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:38,320
efficient and almost easy. Dare I say it? Yes, it still takes work, but the effectiveness of this

30
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,360
system just makes it so much fun to keep using the system because like you can feel the productivity

31
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,840
oozing out of you. Before I show you the way that I use this system for myself, though,

32
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,040
I want to give you some core principles to think about when you're taking notes because this system

33
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,440
is totally malleable to suit your needs. So your system is not going to look exactly like my system,

34
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,560
but there are four core principles that you should keep in mind and aim to adhere to when

35
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,320
you are setting up your Zettelkasten system. So the first principle is write all the time.

36
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,200
Whenever you can write in your own words, that's how notes are going to be stored in this system

37
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,600
is paragraph form writing in your own words. You can take those notes anyway you want,

38
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,240
you can even audio record those notes if you want. But the point is, if you don't write it down or

39
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,640
speak it into a microphone or something, then you're going to lose that knowledge in the recesses

40
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,120
of your brain. The second core principle you should remember is that everything is knowledge.

41
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,400
It's not just what is in your school books and what your teacher says that is valuable information,

42
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,920
it's everything you encounter, like your experiences or your memories or your shower thoughts,

43
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,520
et cetera. The Zettelkasten system is a non hierarchical way of organizing your knowledge.

44
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,640
So it doesn't think one bit of information is more valuable or inherently better than any

45
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,520
other piece of information. And you should make your brain operate the same way. The third core

46
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:06,560
principle is that thought is the basic unit of knowledge in this system. So when you do take

47
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,080
a note, you should think about how to make it as irreducible as possible and yet still one complete

48
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,760
thought. That's going to make more sense later, but that principle is there so that you can adhere

49
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:24,000
to the fourth principle, which is your knowledge is interconnected. Every time you store a note,

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,840
you should be asking yourself, how does this connect to something that is already in my

51
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,520
Zettelkasten system? And what do I already know that connects back to this? Your knowledge is just

52
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,360
a network of interconnected thoughts. The power of this system comes in the quantity and quality

53
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,160
of the connections between your thoughts. So now that you've got those core principles in your head,

54
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,320
I am going to walk you through how I use my Zettelkasten system in the obsidian software to

55
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,600
take notes and capture my knowledge and connect between all of the thought in my brain and also

56
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,240
how to use that to create new thought and then create writing products based on that thought. The

57
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,400
very first step that I take is to make fleeting notes. And this is just how you capture bits of

58
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,360
knowledge and information and ideas and thought that occurs to you over the course of your day.

59
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,120
This can be anything, it can be a thought that popped into your head while you're taking a walk

60
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,400
and so you write it down on a little notepad or take an audio memo or it can be your notes from

61
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:27,520
lecture. In my case for this video, I am going to show you how I take notes on a book, specifically

62
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,760
Alfie Kohn's book Punished by Rewards. While I am reading a book, I actually don't physically write

63
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,640
out notes in my own words because I want to be immersed in the ideas of the book. I don't want

64
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:46,800
that disrupting my reading experience. So instead, I tab up the book with little sticky notes that

65
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,960
are highlighting moments I want to remember from this book because I think I'm going to turn it

66
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,400
into a note later. And then if there's something that just highlighting it wouldn't suffice for the

67
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,880
thought that was going through my brain, I will put a larger sticky note on that page and I will

68
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,720
write down the thought that I was having at that moment. Really, the important thing when

69
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,280
reading a book and taking notes is to remember the thought you were having and why you wanted to

70
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,880
maybe save that idea, but also to note down where you found that idea so that you can cite it and

71
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,840
find it later. So for me, that's easy because I've literally put sticky notes on the page and

72
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,560
location where I found it. But if you're taking notes off of the book, then you'll want to write

73
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,760
down the page number. So the second step is to take permanent notes based on your fleeting notes.

74
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:35,280
This is when you actually write down the ideas in your own words in paragraph form and make that

75
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,400
idea as irreducible as possible. So once I've tabbed up a book or just a chapter of a book,

76
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,840
I will go through each sticky note and I'll ask myself, is this an important enough thing that I

77
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,320
want to write a note about it? And if it is, then I'll write the note and I'll take the sticky note

78
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,400
out. That's especially good for library books because I have to return this to the library so

79
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,960
I can't be writing in the margins. You can always write out all your notes and then divide them up

80
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:05,120
into bite-sized thought bits later. And writing the note can be done on paper and then transcribed

81
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,600
into obsidian, or you can type it directly into obsidian if you'd like. It's all totally up to

82
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:15,040
you. You don't even have to use a computer ever if you don't want to. In fact, Nicholas Luhman's

83
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:21,200
Zettelkasten system was in a series of slip boxes. So he would write out his note on a little Q card

84
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,640
and he would give it a unique identifier and then he would slot it in his box after a corresponding

85
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:32,400
note and then he would literally write out connections to other little pieces of paper that

86
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,800
were in his boxes with their unique identifiers so he knew where to look. That seems awfully laborious

87
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,680
to me in an age where we do have computers but it's up to you. Let's head into my obsidian now

88
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,760
to check out what my Zettelkasten looks like. So welcome to my desktop and welcome to my obsidian

89
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,920
folder. This is a folder that is just housed on my computer and inside of the folder are markdown

90
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:04,160
files which is like just a basic text file so at any point in time I can grab any of my notes and

91
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:11,280
print them or print my entire note system if I want to. I also have a backup of this folder in my

92
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,400
google drive so that I never lose my Zettelkasten system and I will include a link in the description

93
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,480
where you can download obsidian for yourself. So how do I turn my fleeting notes that I took

94
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,880
while reading Alfie Kohn's book punished by rewards and turn them into permanent notes? When you

95
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,640
enter obsidian you can see on the left hand side these are all of the notes that I've taken

96
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,880
and on the right hand side this is where all of the back links will be because obsidian helps you

97
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,960
connect between your notes and creates little links so you can just like click between all of the

98
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:53,920
thought that you have. The first thing I do when I want to put a source like a book into my obsidian

99
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:00,160
is I create a note for the book. I title all of my bibliographic notes after the last name

100
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,920
of the author and the date when the book was published and then I put my MLA citation right at

101
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,720
the top there personally because I know what I'm going to be using these notes for. It's going

102
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:17,840
to be to write papers or blog posts or etc in the future and then I put my first link in here

103
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:23,760
and I want to link this book to another note called bibliography and if I control click

104
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,680
into that note it's just a blank note but you can see here on the right hand side are all of the

105
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:36,640
sources that I have referenced within my obsidian Zettelkasten system so let's go back where's the

106
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:44,320
case to this book that we're talking about today. Now I go about opening my book and turning to the

107
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,760
first sticky that I have in here and the first sticky was for this quote so I write the quote

108
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,000
in there but of course this quote is not in my own words and what's the first principle of this

109
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,200
system it's writing in your own words is the only thing that matters so I'm gonna go and turn this

110
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:08,320
into my own words. There it is I now have a note. My note says while university should be a place

111
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,200
where students discover who they are and what they are interested in oftentimes they are instead

112
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,240
performing for their professors to get the grade so they turn into the people they think their

113
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,120
professors want them to be instead of creative critical thinkers in their own right in this way

114
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,040
and then I link I'm gonna link the book because this is actually going to be its own separate

115
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,600
note from the bibliographic note so I'm actually linking to this book so that I know where it came

116
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:39,520
from directly so cone1993 writes grades reduce a student's sense of control over his own fate

117
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:44,240
and can induce a blind conformity to others wishes and then I put the page number so that I

118
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,080
know where I got this from and I don't even have to reference the book again the next time I want

119
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,960
to use this in a piece of writing so that's my entire note and then I ask myself what is this

120
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:59,920
note about because it needs a name I'm going to create a new note the way in obsidian you create

121
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,200
new notes is you go double square bracket and then you put the name of the note in there so

122
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,520
what is this note about I think the thesis of this note is something like grades inhibit students

123
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:17,440
from becoming independent thinkers I'm gonna write that down the reason this is kind of grayed out

124
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,200
right now is because I haven't actually turned it into a note so I'm gonna take my writing there

125
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:33,360
get it out of the bibliographic note and put it into this note and there we go there's my note

126
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,920
it's written in my own words it's really small it expresses a single idea and I've actually named

127
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,200
the note after that single idea you don't have to name it after the idea that's just what I do

128
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,840
you can use like a time date stamp as long as all of the names of your notes are unique

129
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,360
identifiers so you're not pointing to multiple places at once and then if we look at the right

130
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,760
hand side you can see that there's one other note that has referenced this note and it's just the

131
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,160
bibliographic note but that's not enough that's not a good enough connection just the book it came

132
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,720
from that's not connecting to my other knowledge so I'm going to think to myself what other ideas

133
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,440
might this be related to and I actually took a note the other day about how students are actors

134
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,840
in the world in their own right and that's kind of related to this let's find that note

135
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,480
students students are actors in the world there it is I think the direct connection that I want

136
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,360
to make is that it is important that students make their own choices in school because students

137
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,000
are actors in the world so if they're just making decisions based on what they think their professors

138
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,440
want then that's the professor getting to act in the world through the student but students

139
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,040
are real people and what they do in school matters in the real world so now I have a

140
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:47,520
direct connection to this other idea from a different book let's click on it students are

141
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:54,560
actors in the world okay this is actually an idea that I found in a book by eternity martis

142
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:01,440
that was published in 2020 and it was an idea found on page 25 she also points out that students

143
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,560
get absolved of faults because university isn't the real world so I can see there's also a direct

144
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,360
connection to these other ideas and then on the right hand side I can see oh my goodness there

145
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,640
are even more notes that connect to this idea that students are actors in the real world so

146
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:23,920
maybe I'm writing a paper about this idea and I need I need more things like how there are

147
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:30,080
consequences to dismissing the ideas of students as not real because it's part of school so I'm

148
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,200
gonna click into that note because it's clearly relevant and that's related to this other text

149
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,760
that I haven't made a link to yet but I should oh it's connected the idea that student youth

150
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:46,240
aren't taken seriously etc etc let's go back to our main note that we're working with personally

151
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:53,920
within my bibliographic note I keep all of the notes that are connected to it I will go through

152
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,760
the entire book looking at every single sticky that I stuck in there and turning it into notes

153
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:06,320
within this document sometimes I will stick all of my quotes and notes into this document and then

154
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,200
slowly turn them into their separate notes and then go to the process of connecting those things or

155
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:17,600
you can do it one by one like I just showed you now sometimes I will spend entire sessions in my

156
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,840
zettelkasten system just making connections between notes that haven't been connected yet the last

157
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:29,200
thing that I'll show you in obsidian which is just kind of a cool thing I think is the graph view

158
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:35,440
you can see there's so many connections that I'm making between so much thought it's all interconnected

159
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:42,000
and it looks like a mess when you look at this network and these nodes in this graph view and

160
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,480
it is a bit of a mess and that's what makes it so hard to write things and remember things

161
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:55,280
without a system like zettelkasten helping you out because all of the connections between everything

162
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:02,720
that I know are already made so when I go to write an essay on anything I've already written down

163
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:09,440
that thought and I've already connected that thought to 20 other thoughts and I can just

164
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,280
pull those notes out of my zettelkasten they're written in my own words already and I can plop

165
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,840
them into an essay and just put them in an order that makes sense to me then all I have to do is

166
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,560
the work of connecting those thoughts and making the paper flow but the writing has already been

167
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,160
done the writing's been happening throughout all of my classes and all of my readings all of the time

168
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,520
I think the only thing I want to leave you with now is one last fifth principle that I'm going

169
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:41,440
to tack on here at the end and that is to trust the system if you just take one note in your

170
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,840
zettelkasten nothing magical will happen it is in the number and quality of connections that your

171
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:53,840
zettelkasten is going to work for you and that's one of the big draws for me for zettelkasten as

172
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,280
opposed to notebooks because the more notes you take in a notebook the more chaotic everything

173
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,360
becomes and the less useful because the more notebooks you have to shuffle through to find

174
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,560
your thoughts but in zettelkasten the more notes you take and the more connections you make between

175
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:15,040
those notes the more valuable your zettelkasten gets and the easier it is to come up with ideas for

176
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,720
writing projects and actually start writing the projects so I hope this video has been useful

177
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,240
to you I'm sure that I will be making more videos on this topic if there's anything you specifically

178
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,360
want to ask or want me to make a video about let me know and I will make it happen I will also be

179
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,640
putting links in the description box below to where you can download obsidian as well as

180
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,280
external information from other people that I think have done a good job explaining how to use

181
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:46,160
the zettelkasten as always you can give me a comment to let me know what you are thinking about

182
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,960
ask any questions tell me how you currently take notes whether you think that you want to switch

183
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,920
to the zettelkasten system thank you for watching everybody I hope that you took some fleeting notes

184
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,800
during this video that you are now going to turn into permanent notes in your own zettelkasten system

185
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,400
and connect them to all of your other knowledges if you want more content like this I mostly talk

186
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,840
about books that I'm reading but I am also going to start doing more teaching and learning and

187
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,800
knowledge management style videos so if you're interested in that content then feel free to

188
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:27,760
subscribe to my channel and I'll see you in another video soon
