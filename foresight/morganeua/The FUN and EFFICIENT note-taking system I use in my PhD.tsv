0	6160	Hello! My name is Morgan, and I am a fifth year PhD candidate in theater and performance studies.
6160	12320	And when I started my PhD program, I quickly realized that the way I was taking notes in
12320	17520	undergrad just wasn't going to cut it for this new program. So I started looking into
17520	22720	different methods of note-taking that might help me out in my PhD. And specifically what I needed
22720	28720	was a way to store huge amounts of information so that it was easily accessible at a later date
28720	33440	when I needed it to write a paper. And preferably all of that information would be
33440	39440	fully interconnected with all of my other knowledge so that I can make surprising connections between
39440	45200	my thoughts and turn them into creative and critical thinking within my papers. And especially
45200	52080	within my dissertation. But that is kind of a big ask for a note-taking method to do.
52080	56880	And what I was doing in my undergrad was just highlighting quotes in books and writing in
56880	63120	the margins, and I would take notes on notebooks. And yes, I would organize those notes kind of with
63120	67440	a table of contents, marking where each thing was in each book. But then when I actually went to
67440	71840	write a paper, I would have like a stack of five notebooks. I would have to be flipping through to
71840	76800	see if I had written down the thought that I wanted to use for that paper. But I couldn't even fully
76800	81200	remember when and where I learned that thought. And the only organizational method was when and
81200	85520	where I learned that thought because, you know, it was organized by the courses I was taking,
85520	91120	not by logically where that information belongs in my brain. So I had a bit of a problem.
91840	97200	And whenever I went onto YouTube, say, to look for a tutorial on how to take better notes,
97200	102480	it wouldn't be a holistic system of how to like store and organize those notes. And I now realize
102480	107520	the piece that I was missing was a knowledge management system. And I am so happy to tell you
107520	112720	that I have found a method that works for me and I hope it will work for you too because it is the
112720	116960	method I'm going to be sharing in this video. The system I'm going to be teaching you today and
116960	122320	then walking you through how I use it is called the Zettelkasten method. And this was originally
122320	128400	used by Nicholas Lumen in the 1960s. And we are at an even greater advantage than Lumen was because
128400	134320	we have computers. And there are so many softwares online that you can download to your computer and
134320	139600	do all of the work of connecting your thought for you. Personally, the software I use is called
139600	143920	Obsidian, but there's many other choices out there. So find one that works for you. I think
143920	150560	that the Zettelkasten makes taking and storing notes and learning things actually like fun and
150560	158320	efficient and almost easy. Dare I say it? Yes, it still takes work, but the effectiveness of this
158320	163360	system just makes it so much fun to keep using the system because like you can feel the productivity
163360	167840	oozing out of you. Before I show you the way that I use this system for myself, though,
167840	173040	I want to give you some core principles to think about when you're taking notes because this system
173040	179440	is totally malleable to suit your needs. So your system is not going to look exactly like my system,
179440	184560	but there are four core principles that you should keep in mind and aim to adhere to when
184560	190320	you are setting up your Zettelkasten system. So the first principle is write all the time.
190320	195200	Whenever you can write in your own words, that's how notes are going to be stored in this system
195200	199600	is paragraph form writing in your own words. You can take those notes anyway you want,
199600	204240	you can even audio record those notes if you want. But the point is, if you don't write it down or
204240	208640	speak it into a microphone or something, then you're going to lose that knowledge in the recesses
208640	213120	of your brain. The second core principle you should remember is that everything is knowledge.
213120	218400	It's not just what is in your school books and what your teacher says that is valuable information,
218400	223920	it's everything you encounter, like your experiences or your memories or your shower thoughts,
223920	229520	et cetera. The Zettelkasten system is a non hierarchical way of organizing your knowledge.
229520	234640	So it doesn't think one bit of information is more valuable or inherently better than any
234640	239520	other piece of information. And you should make your brain operate the same way. The third core
239520	246560	principle is that thought is the basic unit of knowledge in this system. So when you do take
246560	252080	a note, you should think about how to make it as irreducible as possible and yet still one complete
252080	257760	thought. That's going to make more sense later, but that principle is there so that you can adhere
257760	264000	to the fourth principle, which is your knowledge is interconnected. Every time you store a note,
264000	267840	you should be asking yourself, how does this connect to something that is already in my
267840	273520	Zettelkasten system? And what do I already know that connects back to this? Your knowledge is just
273520	279360	a network of interconnected thoughts. The power of this system comes in the quantity and quality
279360	284160	of the connections between your thoughts. So now that you've got those core principles in your head,
284160	290320	I am going to walk you through how I use my Zettelkasten system in the obsidian software to
290320	295600	take notes and capture my knowledge and connect between all of the thought in my brain and also
295600	300240	how to use that to create new thought and then create writing products based on that thought. The
300240	306400	very first step that I take is to make fleeting notes. And this is just how you capture bits of
306400	311360	knowledge and information and ideas and thought that occurs to you over the course of your day.
311360	315120	This can be anything, it can be a thought that popped into your head while you're taking a walk
315120	320400	and so you write it down on a little notepad or take an audio memo or it can be your notes from
320400	327520	lecture. In my case for this video, I am going to show you how I take notes on a book, specifically
327520	333760	Alfie Kohn's book Punished by Rewards. While I am reading a book, I actually don't physically write
333840	338640	out notes in my own words because I want to be immersed in the ideas of the book. I don't want
338640	346800	that disrupting my reading experience. So instead, I tab up the book with little sticky notes that
346800	350960	are highlighting moments I want to remember from this book because I think I'm going to turn it
350960	356400	into a note later. And then if there's something that just highlighting it wouldn't suffice for the
356400	360880	thought that was going through my brain, I will put a larger sticky note on that page and I will
360880	364720	write down the thought that I was having at that moment. Really, the important thing when
364720	369280	reading a book and taking notes is to remember the thought you were having and why you wanted to
369280	374880	maybe save that idea, but also to note down where you found that idea so that you can cite it and
374880	379840	find it later. So for me, that's easy because I've literally put sticky notes on the page and
379840	384560	location where I found it. But if you're taking notes off of the book, then you'll want to write
384560	389760	down the page number. So the second step is to take permanent notes based on your fleeting notes.
389760	395280	This is when you actually write down the ideas in your own words in paragraph form and make that
395280	400400	idea as irreducible as possible. So once I've tabbed up a book or just a chapter of a book,
400400	405840	I will go through each sticky note and I'll ask myself, is this an important enough thing that I
405840	410320	want to write a note about it? And if it is, then I'll write the note and I'll take the sticky note
410320	414400	out. That's especially good for library books because I have to return this to the library so
414400	418960	I can't be writing in the margins. You can always write out all your notes and then divide them up
418960	425120	into bite-sized thought bits later. And writing the note can be done on paper and then transcribed
425120	429600	into obsidian, or you can type it directly into obsidian if you'd like. It's all totally up to
429600	435040	you. You don't even have to use a computer ever if you don't want to. In fact, Nicholas Luhman's
435040	441200	Zettelkasten system was in a series of slip boxes. So he would write out his note on a little Q card
441200	446640	and he would give it a unique identifier and then he would slot it in his box after a corresponding
446640	452400	note and then he would literally write out connections to other little pieces of paper that
452400	458800	were in his boxes with their unique identifiers so he knew where to look. That seems awfully laborious
458800	465680	to me in an age where we do have computers but it's up to you. Let's head into my obsidian now
465680	471760	to check out what my Zettelkasten looks like. So welcome to my desktop and welcome to my obsidian
471760	477920	folder. This is a folder that is just housed on my computer and inside of the folder are markdown
477920	484160	files which is like just a basic text file so at any point in time I can grab any of my notes and
484720	491280	print them or print my entire note system if I want to. I also have a backup of this folder in my
491280	496400	google drive so that I never lose my Zettelkasten system and I will include a link in the description
496400	502480	where you can download obsidian for yourself. So how do I turn my fleeting notes that I took
502480	508880	while reading Alfie Kohn's book punished by rewards and turn them into permanent notes? When you
508880	514640	enter obsidian you can see on the left hand side these are all of the notes that I've taken
514640	520880	and on the right hand side this is where all of the back links will be because obsidian helps you
520880	526960	connect between your notes and creates little links so you can just like click between all of the
526960	533920	thought that you have. The first thing I do when I want to put a source like a book into my obsidian
533920	540160	is I create a note for the book. I title all of my bibliographic notes after the last name
540160	545920	of the author and the date when the book was published and then I put my MLA citation right at
545920	550720	the top there personally because I know what I'm going to be using these notes for. It's going
550720	557840	to be to write papers or blog posts or etc in the future and then I put my first link in here
557840	563760	and I want to link this book to another note called bibliography and if I control click
563760	569680	into that note it's just a blank note but you can see here on the right hand side are all of the
569680	576640	sources that I have referenced within my obsidian Zettelkasten system so let's go back where's the
576640	584320	case to this book that we're talking about today. Now I go about opening my book and turning to the
584320	589760	first sticky that I have in here and the first sticky was for this quote so I write the quote
589760	594000	in there but of course this quote is not in my own words and what's the first principle of this
594000	601200	system it's writing in your own words is the only thing that matters so I'm gonna go and turn this
601200	608320	into my own words. There it is I now have a note. My note says while university should be a place
608320	613200	where students discover who they are and what they are interested in oftentimes they are instead
613200	618240	performing for their professors to get the grade so they turn into the people they think their
618240	623120	professors want them to be instead of creative critical thinkers in their own right in this way
623120	627040	and then I link I'm gonna link the book because this is actually going to be its own separate
627040	631600	note from the bibliographic note so I'm actually linking to this book so that I know where it came
631600	639520	from directly so cone1993 writes grades reduce a student's sense of control over his own fate
639520	644240	and can induce a blind conformity to others wishes and then I put the page number so that I
644240	648080	know where I got this from and I don't even have to reference the book again the next time I want
648080	652960	to use this in a piece of writing so that's my entire note and then I ask myself what is this
652960	659920	note about because it needs a name I'm going to create a new note the way in obsidian you create
659920	665200	new notes is you go double square bracket and then you put the name of the note in there so
665920	671520	what is this note about I think the thesis of this note is something like grades inhibit students
671520	677440	from becoming independent thinkers I'm gonna write that down the reason this is kind of grayed out
677440	683200	right now is because I haven't actually turned it into a note so I'm gonna take my writing there
684240	693360	get it out of the bibliographic note and put it into this note and there we go there's my note
693360	697920	it's written in my own words it's really small it expresses a single idea and I've actually named
697920	703200	the note after that single idea you don't have to name it after the idea that's just what I do
703200	707840	you can use like a time date stamp as long as all of the names of your notes are unique
707840	711360	identifiers so you're not pointing to multiple places at once and then if we look at the right
711360	715760	hand side you can see that there's one other note that has referenced this note and it's just the
715760	720160	bibliographic note but that's not enough that's not a good enough connection just the book it came
720160	724720	from that's not connecting to my other knowledge so I'm going to think to myself what other ideas
724720	729440	might this be related to and I actually took a note the other day about how students are actors
729520	733840	in the world in their own right and that's kind of related to this let's find that note
735120	740480	students students are actors in the world there it is I think the direct connection that I want
740480	745360	to make is that it is important that students make their own choices in school because students
745360	750000	are actors in the world so if they're just making decisions based on what they think their professors
750000	755440	want then that's the professor getting to act in the world through the student but students
755440	761040	are real people and what they do in school matters in the real world so now I have a
761040	767520	direct connection to this other idea from a different book let's click on it students are
767520	774560	actors in the world okay this is actually an idea that I found in a book by eternity martis
774560	781440	that was published in 2020 and it was an idea found on page 25 she also points out that students
781440	786560	get absolved of faults because university isn't the real world so I can see there's also a direct
786560	791360	connection to these other ideas and then on the right hand side I can see oh my goodness there
791360	796640	are even more notes that connect to this idea that students are actors in the real world so
796640	803920	maybe I'm writing a paper about this idea and I need I need more things like how there are
803920	810080	consequences to dismissing the ideas of students as not real because it's part of school so I'm
810080	815200	gonna click into that note because it's clearly relevant and that's related to this other text
815200	819760	that I haven't made a link to yet but I should oh it's connected the idea that student youth
819760	826240	aren't taken seriously etc etc let's go back to our main note that we're working with personally
826240	833920	within my bibliographic note I keep all of the notes that are connected to it I will go through
833920	839760	the entire book looking at every single sticky that I stuck in there and turning it into notes
839760	846320	within this document sometimes I will stick all of my quotes and notes into this document and then
846320	851200	slowly turn them into their separate notes and then go to the process of connecting those things or
851200	857600	you can do it one by one like I just showed you now sometimes I will spend entire sessions in my
857600	863840	zettelkasten system just making connections between notes that haven't been connected yet the last
863840	869200	thing that I'll show you in obsidian which is just kind of a cool thing I think is the graph view
869200	875440	you can see there's so many connections that I'm making between so much thought it's all interconnected
875440	882000	and it looks like a mess when you look at this network and these nodes in this graph view and
882000	888480	it is a bit of a mess and that's what makes it so hard to write things and remember things
888480	895280	without a system like zettelkasten helping you out because all of the connections between everything
895280	902720	that I know are already made so when I go to write an essay on anything I've already written down
902720	909440	that thought and I've already connected that thought to 20 other thoughts and I can just
909440	915280	pull those notes out of my zettelkasten they're written in my own words already and I can plop
915280	919840	them into an essay and just put them in an order that makes sense to me then all I have to do is
919840	924560	the work of connecting those thoughts and making the paper flow but the writing has already been
924560	930160	done the writing's been happening throughout all of my classes and all of my readings all of the time
930160	935520	I think the only thing I want to leave you with now is one last fifth principle that I'm going
935520	941440	to tack on here at the end and that is to trust the system if you just take one note in your
941440	947840	zettelkasten nothing magical will happen it is in the number and quality of connections that your
947840	953840	zettelkasten is going to work for you and that's one of the big draws for me for zettelkasten as
953920	959280	opposed to notebooks because the more notes you take in a notebook the more chaotic everything
959280	963360	becomes and the less useful because the more notebooks you have to shuffle through to find
963360	968560	your thoughts but in zettelkasten the more notes you take and the more connections you make between
968560	975040	those notes the more valuable your zettelkasten gets and the easier it is to come up with ideas for
975040	980720	writing projects and actually start writing the projects so I hope this video has been useful
980720	986240	to you I'm sure that I will be making more videos on this topic if there's anything you specifically
986240	991360	want to ask or want me to make a video about let me know and I will make it happen I will also be
991360	996640	putting links in the description box below to where you can download obsidian as well as
996640	1001280	external information from other people that I think have done a good job explaining how to use
1001280	1006160	the zettelkasten as always you can give me a comment to let me know what you are thinking about
1006160	1010960	ask any questions tell me how you currently take notes whether you think that you want to switch
1010960	1015920	to the zettelkasten system thank you for watching everybody I hope that you took some fleeting notes
1015920	1020800	during this video that you are now going to turn into permanent notes in your own zettelkasten system
1020800	1026400	and connect them to all of your other knowledges if you want more content like this I mostly talk
1026400	1031840	about books that I'm reading but I am also going to start doing more teaching and learning and
1031840	1036800	knowledge management style videos so if you're interested in that content then feel free to
1036800	1047760	subscribe to my channel and I'll see you in another video soon
