Hello! My name is Morgan, and I am a fifth year PhD candidate in theater and performance studies.

00:06.160 --> 00:12.320
And when I started my PhD program, I quickly realized that the way I was taking notes in

00:12.320 --> 00:17.520
undergrad just wasn't going to cut it for this new program. So I started looking into

00:17.520 --> 00:22.720
different methods of note-taking that might help me out in my PhD. And specifically what I needed

00:22.720 --> 00:28.720
was a way to store huge amounts of information so that it was easily accessible at a later date

00:28.720 --> 00:33.440
when I needed it to write a paper. And preferably all of that information would be

00:33.440 --> 00:39.440
fully interconnected with all of my other knowledge so that I can make surprising connections between

00:39.440 --> 00:45.200
my thoughts and turn them into creative and critical thinking within my papers. And especially

00:45.200 --> 00:52.080
within my dissertation. But that is kind of a big ask for a note-taking method to do.

00:52.080 --> 00:56.880
And what I was doing in my undergrad was just highlighting quotes in books and writing in

00:56.880 --> 01:03.120
the margins, and I would take notes on notebooks. And yes, I would organize those notes kind of with

01:03.120 --> 01:07.440
a table of contents, marking where each thing was in each book. But then when I actually went to

01:07.440 --> 01:11.840
write a paper, I would have like a stack of five notebooks. I would have to be flipping through to

01:11.840 --> 01:16.800
see if I had written down the thought that I wanted to use for that paper. But I couldn't even fully

01:16.800 --> 01:21.200
remember when and where I learned that thought. And the only organizational method was when and

01:21.200 --> 01:25.520
where I learned that thought because, you know, it was organized by the courses I was taking,

01:25.520 --> 01:31.120
not by logically where that information belongs in my brain. So I had a bit of a problem.

01:31.840 --> 01:37.200
And whenever I went onto YouTube, say, to look for a tutorial on how to take better notes,

01:37.200 --> 01:42.480
it wouldn't be a holistic system of how to like store and organize those notes. And I now realize

01:42.480 --> 01:47.520
the piece that I was missing was a knowledge management system. And I am so happy to tell you

01:47.520 --> 01:52.720
that I have found a method that works for me and I hope it will work for you too because it is the

01:52.720 --> 01:56.960
method I'm going to be sharing in this video. The system I'm going to be teaching you today and

01:56.960 --> 02:02.320
then walking you through how I use it is called the Zettelkasten method. And this was originally

02:02.320 --> 02:08.400
used by Nicholas Lumen in the 1960s. And we are at an even greater advantage than Lumen was because

02:08.400 --> 02:14.320
we have computers. And there are so many softwares online that you can download to your computer and

02:14.320 --> 02:19.600
do all of the work of connecting your thought for you. Personally, the software I use is called

02:19.600 --> 02:23.920
Obsidian, but there's many other choices out there. So find one that works for you. I think

02:23.920 --> 02:30.560
that the Zettelkasten makes taking and storing notes and learning things actually like fun and

02:30.560 --> 02:38.320
efficient and almost easy. Dare I say it? Yes, it still takes work, but the effectiveness of this

02:38.320 --> 02:43.360
system just makes it so much fun to keep using the system because like you can feel the productivity

02:43.360 --> 02:47.840
oozing out of you. Before I show you the way that I use this system for myself, though,

02:47.840 --> 02:53.040
I want to give you some core principles to think about when you're taking notes because this system

02:53.040 --> 02:59.440
is totally malleable to suit your needs. So your system is not going to look exactly like my system,

02:59.440 --> 03:04.560
but there are four core principles that you should keep in mind and aim to adhere to when

03:04.560 --> 03:10.320
you are setting up your Zettelkasten system. So the first principle is write all the time.

03:10.320 --> 03:15.200
Whenever you can write in your own words, that's how notes are going to be stored in this system

03:15.200 --> 03:19.600
is paragraph form writing in your own words. You can take those notes anyway you want,

03:19.600 --> 03:24.240
you can even audio record those notes if you want. But the point is, if you don't write it down or

03:24.240 --> 03:28.640
speak it into a microphone or something, then you're going to lose that knowledge in the recesses

03:28.640 --> 03:33.120
of your brain. The second core principle you should remember is that everything is knowledge.

03:33.120 --> 03:38.400
It's not just what is in your school books and what your teacher says that is valuable information,

03:38.400 --> 03:43.920
it's everything you encounter, like your experiences or your memories or your shower thoughts,

03:43.920 --> 03:49.520
et cetera. The Zettelkasten system is a non hierarchical way of organizing your knowledge.

03:49.520 --> 03:54.640
So it doesn't think one bit of information is more valuable or inherently better than any

03:54.640 --> 03:59.520
other piece of information. And you should make your brain operate the same way. The third core

03:59.520 --> 04:06.560
principle is that thought is the basic unit of knowledge in this system. So when you do take

04:06.560 --> 04:12.080
a note, you should think about how to make it as irreducible as possible and yet still one complete

04:12.080 --> 04:17.760
thought. That's going to make more sense later, but that principle is there so that you can adhere

04:17.760 --> 04:24.000
to the fourth principle, which is your knowledge is interconnected. Every time you store a note,

04:24.000 --> 04:27.840
you should be asking yourself, how does this connect to something that is already in my

04:27.840 --> 04:33.520
Zettelkasten system? And what do I already know that connects back to this? Your knowledge is just

04:33.520 --> 04:39.360
a network of interconnected thoughts. The power of this system comes in the quantity and quality

04:39.360 --> 04:44.160
of the connections between your thoughts. So now that you've got those core principles in your head,

04:44.160 --> 04:50.320
I am going to walk you through how I use my Zettelkasten system in the obsidian software to

04:50.320 --> 04:55.600
take notes and capture my knowledge and connect between all of the thought in my brain and also

04:55.600 --> 05:00.240
how to use that to create new thought and then create writing products based on that thought. The

05:00.240 --> 05:06.400
very first step that I take is to make fleeting notes. And this is just how you capture bits of

05:06.400 --> 05:11.360
knowledge and information and ideas and thought that occurs to you over the course of your day.

05:11.360 --> 05:15.120
This can be anything, it can be a thought that popped into your head while you're taking a walk

05:15.120 --> 05:20.400
and so you write it down on a little notepad or take an audio memo or it can be your notes from

05:20.400 --> 05:27.520
lecture. In my case for this video, I am going to show you how I take notes on a book, specifically

05:27.520 --> 05:33.760
Alfie Kohn's book Punished by Rewards. While I am reading a book, I actually don't physically write

05:33.840 --> 05:38.640
out notes in my own words because I want to be immersed in the ideas of the book. I don't want

05:38.640 --> 05:46.800
that disrupting my reading experience. So instead, I tab up the book with little sticky notes that

05:46.800 --> 05:50.960
are highlighting moments I want to remember from this book because I think I'm going to turn it

05:50.960 --> 05:56.400
into a note later. And then if there's something that just highlighting it wouldn't suffice for the

05:56.400 --> 06:00.880
thought that was going through my brain, I will put a larger sticky note on that page and I will

06:00.880 --> 06:04.720
write down the thought that I was having at that moment. Really, the important thing when

06:04.720 --> 06:09.280
reading a book and taking notes is to remember the thought you were having and why you wanted to

06:09.280 --> 06:14.880
maybe save that idea, but also to note down where you found that idea so that you can cite it and

06:14.880 --> 06:19.840
find it later. So for me, that's easy because I've literally put sticky notes on the page and

06:19.840 --> 06:24.560
location where I found it. But if you're taking notes off of the book, then you'll want to write

06:24.560 --> 06:29.760
down the page number. So the second step is to take permanent notes based on your fleeting notes.

06:29.760 --> 06:35.280
This is when you actually write down the ideas in your own words in paragraph form and make that

06:35.280 --> 06:40.400
idea as irreducible as possible. So once I've tabbed up a book or just a chapter of a book,

06:40.400 --> 06:45.840
I will go through each sticky note and I'll ask myself, is this an important enough thing that I

06:45.840 --> 06:50.320
want to write a note about it? And if it is, then I'll write the note and I'll take the sticky note

06:50.320 --> 06:54.400
out. That's especially good for library books because I have to return this to the library so

06:54.400 --> 06:58.960
I can't be writing in the margins. You can always write out all your notes and then divide them up

06:58.960 --> 07:05.120
into bite-sized thought bits later. And writing the note can be done on paper and then transcribed

07:05.120 --> 07:09.600
into obsidian, or you can type it directly into obsidian if you'd like. It's all totally up to

07:09.600 --> 07:15.040
you. You don't even have to use a computer ever if you don't want to. In fact, Nicholas Luhman's

07:15.040 --> 07:21.200
Zettelkasten system was in a series of slip boxes. So he would write out his note on a little Q card

07:21.200 --> 07:26.640
and he would give it a unique identifier and then he would slot it in his box after a corresponding

07:26.640 --> 07:32.400
note and then he would literally write out connections to other little pieces of paper that

07:32.400 --> 07:38.800
were in his boxes with their unique identifiers so he knew where to look. That seems awfully laborious

07:38.800 --> 07:45.680
to me in an age where we do have computers but it's up to you. Let's head into my obsidian now

07:45.680 --> 07:51.760
to check out what my Zettelkasten looks like. So welcome to my desktop and welcome to my obsidian

07:51.760 --> 07:57.920
folder. This is a folder that is just housed on my computer and inside of the folder are markdown

07:57.920 --> 08:04.160
files which is like just a basic text file so at any point in time I can grab any of my notes and

08:04.720 --> 08:11.280
print them or print my entire note system if I want to. I also have a backup of this folder in my

08:11.280 --> 08:16.400
google drive so that I never lose my Zettelkasten system and I will include a link in the description

08:16.400 --> 08:22.480
where you can download obsidian for yourself. So how do I turn my fleeting notes that I took

08:22.480 --> 08:28.880
while reading Alfie Kohn's book punished by rewards and turn them into permanent notes? When you

08:28.880 --> 08:34.640
enter obsidian you can see on the left hand side these are all of the notes that I've taken

08:34.640 --> 08:40.880
and on the right hand side this is where all of the back links will be because obsidian helps you

08:40.880 --> 08:46.960
connect between your notes and creates little links so you can just like click between all of the

08:46.960 --> 08:53.920
thought that you have. The first thing I do when I want to put a source like a book into my obsidian

08:53.920 --> 09:00.160
is I create a note for the book. I title all of my bibliographic notes after the last name

09:00.160 --> 09:05.920
of the author and the date when the book was published and then I put my MLA citation right at

09:05.920 --> 09:10.720
the top there personally because I know what I'm going to be using these notes for. It's going

09:10.720 --> 09:17.840
to be to write papers or blog posts or etc in the future and then I put my first link in here

09:17.840 --> 09:23.760
and I want to link this book to another note called bibliography and if I control click

09:23.760 --> 09:29.680
into that note it's just a blank note but you can see here on the right hand side are all of the

09:29.680 --> 09:36.640
sources that I have referenced within my obsidian Zettelkasten system so let's go back where's the

09:36.640 --> 09:44.320
case to this book that we're talking about today. Now I go about opening my book and turning to the

09:44.320 --> 09:49.760
first sticky that I have in here and the first sticky was for this quote so I write the quote

09:49.760 --> 09:54.000
in there but of course this quote is not in my own words and what's the first principle of this

09:54.000 --> 10:01.200
system it's writing in your own words is the only thing that matters so I'm gonna go and turn this

10:01.200 --> 10:08.320
into my own words. There it is I now have a note. My note says while university should be a place

10:08.320 --> 10:13.200
where students discover who they are and what they are interested in oftentimes they are instead

10:13.200 --> 10:18.240
performing for their professors to get the grade so they turn into the people they think their

10:18.240 --> 10:23.120
professors want them to be instead of creative critical thinkers in their own right in this way

10:23.120 --> 10:27.040
and then I link I'm gonna link the book because this is actually going to be its own separate

10:27.040 --> 10:31.600
note from the bibliographic note so I'm actually linking to this book so that I know where it came

10:31.600 --> 10:39.520
from directly so cone1993 writes grades reduce a student's sense of control over his own fate

10:39.520 --> 10:44.240
and can induce a blind conformity to others wishes and then I put the page number so that I

10:44.240 --> 10:48.080
know where I got this from and I don't even have to reference the book again the next time I want

10:48.080 --> 10:52.960
to use this in a piece of writing so that's my entire note and then I ask myself what is this

10:52.960 --> 10:59.920
note about because it needs a name I'm going to create a new note the way in obsidian you create

10:59.920 --> 11:05.200
new notes is you go double square bracket and then you put the name of the note in there so

11:05.920 --> 11:11.520
what is this note about I think the thesis of this note is something like grades inhibit students

11:11.520 --> 11:17.440
from becoming independent thinkers I'm gonna write that down the reason this is kind of grayed out

11:17.440 --> 11:23.200
right now is because I haven't actually turned it into a note so I'm gonna take my writing there

11:24.240 --> 11:33.360
get it out of the bibliographic note and put it into this note and there we go there's my note

11:33.360 --> 11:37.920
it's written in my own words it's really small it expresses a single idea and I've actually named

11:37.920 --> 11:43.200
the note after that single idea you don't have to name it after the idea that's just what I do

11:43.200 --> 11:47.840
you can use like a time date stamp as long as all of the names of your notes are unique

11:47.840 --> 11:51.360
identifiers so you're not pointing to multiple places at once and then if we look at the right

11:51.360 --> 11:55.760
hand side you can see that there's one other note that has referenced this note and it's just the

11:55.760 --> 12:00.160
bibliographic note but that's not enough that's not a good enough connection just the book it came

12:00.160 --> 12:04.720
from that's not connecting to my other knowledge so I'm going to think to myself what other ideas

12:04.720 --> 12:09.440
might this be related to and I actually took a note the other day about how students are actors

12:09.520 --> 12:13.840
in the world in their own right and that's kind of related to this let's find that note

12:15.120 --> 12:20.480
students students are actors in the world there it is I think the direct connection that I want

12:20.480 --> 12:25.360
to make is that it is important that students make their own choices in school because students

12:25.360 --> 12:30.000
are actors in the world so if they're just making decisions based on what they think their professors

12:30.000 --> 12:35.440
want then that's the professor getting to act in the world through the student but students

12:35.440 --> 12:41.040
are real people and what they do in school matters in the real world so now I have a

12:41.040 --> 12:47.520
direct connection to this other idea from a different book let's click on it students are

12:47.520 --> 12:54.560
actors in the world okay this is actually an idea that I found in a book by eternity martis

12:54.560 --> 13:01.440
that was published in 2020 and it was an idea found on page 25 she also points out that students

13:01.440 --> 13:06.560
get absolved of faults because university isn't the real world so I can see there's also a direct

13:06.560 --> 13:11.360
connection to these other ideas and then on the right hand side I can see oh my goodness there

13:11.360 --> 13:16.640
are even more notes that connect to this idea that students are actors in the real world so

13:16.640 --> 13:23.920
maybe I'm writing a paper about this idea and I need I need more things like how there are

13:23.920 --> 13:30.080
consequences to dismissing the ideas of students as not real because it's part of school so I'm

13:30.080 --> 13:35.200
gonna click into that note because it's clearly relevant and that's related to this other text

13:35.200 --> 13:39.760
that I haven't made a link to yet but I should oh it's connected the idea that student youth

13:39.760 --> 13:46.240
aren't taken seriously etc etc let's go back to our main note that we're working with personally

13:46.240 --> 13:53.920
within my bibliographic note I keep all of the notes that are connected to it I will go through

13:53.920 --> 13:59.760
the entire book looking at every single sticky that I stuck in there and turning it into notes

13:59.760 --> 14:06.320
within this document sometimes I will stick all of my quotes and notes into this document and then

14:06.320 --> 14:11.200
slowly turn them into their separate notes and then go to the process of connecting those things or

14:11.200 --> 14:17.600
you can do it one by one like I just showed you now sometimes I will spend entire sessions in my

14:17.600 --> 14:23.840
zettelkasten system just making connections between notes that haven't been connected yet the last

14:23.840 --> 14:29.200
thing that I'll show you in obsidian which is just kind of a cool thing I think is the graph view

14:29.200 --> 14:35.440
you can see there's so many connections that I'm making between so much thought it's all interconnected

14:35.440 --> 14:42.000
and it looks like a mess when you look at this network and these nodes in this graph view and

14:42.000 --> 14:48.480
it is a bit of a mess and that's what makes it so hard to write things and remember things

14:48.480 --> 14:55.280
without a system like zettelkasten helping you out because all of the connections between everything

14:55.280 --> 15:02.720
that I know are already made so when I go to write an essay on anything I've already written down

15:02.720 --> 15:09.440
that thought and I've already connected that thought to 20 other thoughts and I can just

15:09.440 --> 15:15.280
pull those notes out of my zettelkasten they're written in my own words already and I can plop

15:15.280 --> 15:19.840
them into an essay and just put them in an order that makes sense to me then all I have to do is

15:19.840 --> 15:24.560
the work of connecting those thoughts and making the paper flow but the writing has already been

15:24.560 --> 15:30.160
done the writing's been happening throughout all of my classes and all of my readings all of the time

15:30.160 --> 15:35.520
I think the only thing I want to leave you with now is one last fifth principle that I'm going

15:35.520 --> 15:41.440
to tack on here at the end and that is to trust the system if you just take one note in your

15:41.440 --> 15:47.840
zettelkasten nothing magical will happen it is in the number and quality of connections that your

15:47.840 --> 15:53.840
zettelkasten is going to work for you and that's one of the big draws for me for zettelkasten as

15:53.920 --> 15:59.280
opposed to notebooks because the more notes you take in a notebook the more chaotic everything

15:59.280 --> 16:03.360
becomes and the less useful because the more notebooks you have to shuffle through to find

16:03.360 --> 16:08.560
your thoughts but in zettelkasten the more notes you take and the more connections you make between

16:08.560 --> 16:15.040
those notes the more valuable your zettelkasten gets and the easier it is to come up with ideas for

16:15.040 --> 16:20.720
writing projects and actually start writing the projects so I hope this video has been useful

16:20.720 --> 16:26.240
to you I'm sure that I will be making more videos on this topic if there's anything you specifically

16:26.240 --> 16:31.360
want to ask or want me to make a video about let me know and I will make it happen I will also be
