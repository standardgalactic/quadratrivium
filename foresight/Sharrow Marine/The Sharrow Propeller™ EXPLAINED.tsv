0	15000	Good morning. We think about inventions and what they've done to the world, and a lot of things come to mind, light bulbs and such, and they change the world.
15000	21000	And then we've got inventions that change industries, you know, microwave ovens and smart phones.
21000	36000	And we look at our propeller industry, and we've got the modern propeller invented in 1833, John Patch in the harbor in the Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, go camera.
36000	49000	And it was a fan propeller, cranked by hand, it was a prop shaft, and he went across the harbor and started an industry that hasn't changed dramatically in a lot of flood years.
49000	55000	And we've got a new invention, the shower propeller, and we've got the inventor here today to talk to us.
55000	62000	And we're the leading edge of the industry, the front line, if you will, and I've got a lot to learn.
62000	70000	So it's my pleasure to introduce Greg Sharrow and learn all about his invention and his company and his progress. Thanks.
70000	80000	Thank you for that introduction, Brian, and thank you all for having me.
80000	88000	When Brian called me and asked me if I would be interested in coming and speaking to all of you, I immediately said yes.
88000	97000	And so it was important for me to have an opportunity to tell you a little bit about the background of Sharrow Marine and our technology,
97000	106000	and also give you a little bit of insight into how the propeller works and what it does differently than a standard prop.
106000	116000	So this was filmed at the University of Michigan's hydrodynamic facility, and what you're about to see is one second of time that is slowed down to one minute.
116000	123000	And you're going to notice that there are very pronounced tip vortices in the standard propeller, and you can see that there is virtually no tip vortices,
123000	126000	no standard tip vortices for the Sharrow propeller.
126000	134000	Another thing to pay attention to is these propellers are the exact same diameter, they're the exact same pitch, and they are the exact same blade area.
134000	142000	And they're both rotating at the exact same RPM, and they're all going through the water at the exact same speed, meters per second.
142000	146000	And you will notice that the Sharrow prop is bringing in more dye.
146000	150000	It is sucking in more fluid than the standard propeller.
150000	154000	Normal propellers look at the water in front of the propeller.
154000	159000	Our propellers look at the water in front of the propeller, and we also look at the water on the sides.
159000	165000	So as we're going through the water, we're not just vacuuming in the water from the front, kicking out of the back.
165000	169000	We're sucking in everything, like a black hole, and then funneling everything through the back.
169000	177000	So you can clearly see the tip vortices on the standard propeller, there's an arrow there, and there is no traditional tip vortices with the Sharrow prop.
177000	181000	This leads to a dramatic reduction in sound.
181000	190000	Like I said earlier, people think that all the noise is coming from the outboard, but a lot of it is coming from the tip vortices and the propeller itself.
190000	196000	And when people try our props for the first time, one of the things that everybody remarks on is, wow, it's so quiet.
196000	205000	If we were on a boat together with one of our props, and we were going 30 miles an hour, I could talk to you like this, and we could have a conversation without elevating our voice.
205000	211000	And that, I think, is one of the greatest benefits for the recreational industry.
211000	217000	It makes it safer because you can hear what's going on, and it reduces fatigue on the boat.
217000	226000	And I'm going to show you a clip of our props on a triple Yamaha 300 on a contender 35ST going 40 miles an hour.
226000	228000	The sound reduction of our props is dramatic.
228000	251000	That roar isn't the motor. It's actually the tip vortices.
259000	274000	So whenever we engage a customer, after they are done asking questions about how it was invented, they want to know more about why it does what it does and what is really different between a standard prop and ours.
274000	277000	We've talked about the tip vortices and tip vortices to cavitation.
277000	281000	Another attribute of our prop is it just doesn't slip like a standard prop.
281000	285000	Because it holds that water in, it doesn't let go of the water very easily.
285000	290000	The water ends up being kicked out the back and not slipping off the tips the way a standard prop would.
290000	297000	So we move about forward further with every rotation that a standard prop does with equivalent pitch.
297000	307000	We call our actual pitch our true advance as a way to try to educate customers as to what the difference is between our props and standard props.
307000	312000	Most people think that props slip around 10%. Somewhere in that range, 10 to 15.
312000	324000	The actual slip, the difference between the pitch on the box and how far forward that prop actually goes with a standard prop versus ours is much more dramatic.
324000	329000	I'm going to show some examples of that and how our prop helps with not slipping.
329000	338000	In the spot where people do operate their boats in the mid-range, the standard prop is slipping 61%, 58%, 73%.
338000	343000	We hit our maximum advance rate as soon as we get up out of the hole and not playing.
343000	351000	You can see that our advance rate hits for this particular situation around 81% of our pitch.
351000	357000	We're hitting that right out of the hole as soon as you're up on the plane going 25 miles an hour.
357000	366000	And what that looks like in terms of a speed versus RPM graph is you can see here, everyone knows, we all talk about getting out of the hole.
366000	369000	This is a graphical representation of the hole.
369000	374000	This is what the red line that you see is what we see in every boat that we've ever tested.
374000	377000	We've tested hundreds and hundreds of boats at this point.
377000	379000	We see this all the time.
379000	382000	You're either on plane or you're not with a standard prop.
382000	390000	And if you're not on plane, you're going around up to 10 miles an hour and then you try to get out of the hole and then you finally get out of the hole.
390000	396000	And when you're out of the hole, you're going around 4,000 RPMs, you're going 30, 35 miles an hour and you have to maintain that in order to stay out of the hole.
396000	398000	Otherwise, you fall right back into it.
398000	403000	Each one of our propellers has more than double the amount of vertical force generated in the standard propeller.
403000	409000	So if you have a triple rig, it's like there's a piano worth of weight pushing up the stern of the boat.
409000	417000	So when our props push the boat out of the water, instead of it going bow high and climbing out of the hole, the whole boat just kind of raises up like it's on an elevator.
417000	423000	And you can see here represented every 500 RPMs getting another 5 miles an hour.
423000	429000	Standard propeller between 2,500 RPMs and 3,000 RPMs gained 1 mile an hour.
429000	434000	For this application, we were asked to just show up with 17-inch pitch props.
434000	443000	That's it. One set. And put them on this boat and see what it could do with this fisherman to really test what our out-of-the-box props could do that we're not optimized.
443000	449000	We have a series we designed for Yamaha, 22 different pitches, and it's hot-swappable with their Saltwater Series 2 series.
449000	462000	So Yamaha asked us to come out to Seattle and spend some time with somebody who they knew very well, one of their pro fishermen, who was very happy with his boat and very, very happy with the performance of the Yamaha propellers that he had.
462000	475000	And the goal of this experiment is to see if this guy has something that he considers to be a well-tuned rig that he uses, you know, you choose through $20,000 for the fuel a year.
475000	480000	He fishes every day that he can. He's fishing in three continents.
480000	489000	And this is what we saw. At his cruising condition, we're saving him 20% in fuel at 30 miles an hour.
489000	499000	And if you compare the miles per gallon here to RPM, we're on top all the way up until 4,500 RPMs.
499000	504000	And then this is an example of what that means for him in terms of range.
504000	512000	And with our props, he's going to be going 71 miles further on a tank of gas at a specific RPM.
512000	520000	And at 4,000 RPMs with our props, where they start to line up into the sea versus RPM, we're going to get to the destination the same amount of time.
520000	532000	But with our props, he can go 4,000 RPMs instead of 4,500, he can go 4,000 RPMs and he can get to his destination two hours and 58 minutes faster.
532000	540000	Exactly in RPM. But because we're going so much faster, he's going to get there a lot faster and save 30% of fuel while he's doing it.
540000	546000	So our customers are now, there's a learning experience when you get a share of prop and you put it on.
546000	550000	A lot of people just automatically, boom, they go to 4,200 because that's where they drive your boat.
550000	555000	And they notice they're going a lot faster there, but then they start to learn, oh, I can back down.
555000	559000	I can go 3,200 RPMs. I can go 3,300 RPMs.
559000	563000	I can go the same speed that I was going before at 4,000 RPMs.
563000	570000	So the ride is quieter, smoother, less vibration and saving 30% of fuel while he's doing it.
570000	575000	And this is an example of the propeller efficiency of our props versus standard ones.
575000	580000	It took 4,500 RPMs to get this big heavy, this is a big heavy boat.
580000	584000	And it took 4,500 RPMs to get him out of plane and out of the hole.
584000	587000	We do that 1,000 RPMs lower.
587000	594000	And then here's another example of advanced rated inches where we see, and these are the numbers you see again and again and again,
594000	600000	at 3,500 and 4,000, 2,500, 3,000 RPMs, we see numbers like 5,695.
600000	604000	And here again, you see that belly, you see that red line.
604000	610000	That hole that Tom Nelson has to climb out of every single time he's on that boat.
610000	613000	He has two operating conditions on plane or not.
613000	617000	We've created a new operating condition.
617000	619000	I call it second gear.
619000	621000	Before you've got first gear and third.
621000	622000	You're on plane or not.
622000	625000	Now boaters have a whole new operating range.
625000	633000	They can run their boats in 25 miles an hour in rough sea conditions with following seas and stay on plane and track better.
633000	638000	The fact that we don't slip, in addition to the fact that we don't have tip for to seas,
638000	645000	gives us unmatched efficiency, greater range, superior fuel economy, increased load capacities, faster speeds.
645000	653000	Sometimes we see very commonly 10 miles an hour, double the amount of speed in the mid-range RPMs, almost all the time.
653000	658000	We see like 50, 60, 80, 90, 110% faster.
658000	660000	Doesn't matter what hull it is.
660000	666000	If it's a 50-foot catamaran or a small little single outboard or a 65-foot yacht.
666000	673000	We see this incredible ability for our technology to push a boat forward and not slip.
