1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
As I said yesterday, I swapped the talks around, so this is the more philosophical talk.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I had some multiple titles. I couldn't decide. Some of them were semi-cranky in those moments.

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Then Mort gave me a great feeder line. This is about step one.

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This is just an experience report. It's not advocacy. There's no methodology here or science or anything else.

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'd like you to try to think about when was the last time that you thought about something for an entire hour.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Nobody bothered you and you had an idea and you sat for an hour and thought about it.

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
How about for a whole day? Does everybody remember last time I sat and thought about something for a whole day?

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
How about over a course of a month? We had something you were working on and obviously you're not spending all the time every day when you start saying it to a month or a year.

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:55,000
These are tremendously valuable moments if you get to have them at all.

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I consider myself extremely lucky to have had the ability to think about probably three different things for a year or more.

11
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,000
One of them was closure. There's nothing I prize more than that kind of time.

12
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The other thing I'd ask is when was the last time that you felt confident trying to do something you had never done before?

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What do you think it takes to become confident in doing something you'd never done before?

14
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Obviously software developers, a lot of times we're doing the umpteenth application that takes something out of a database and puts it on the web.

15
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But the luckier you are, the more likely you are to encounter problems you've never done before.

16
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,000
How do you start doing that and not feel incredibly at risk?

17
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We'll start by talking about some software development, things we all know to be true.

18
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We hate bugs in our programs. We're trying to write quality programs.

19
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We know if we let the programs reach the field, it's incredibly expensive to fix inadequacies in the program.

20
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So we say, okay, we'll have a big testing process and quality assurance.

21
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And even that we know is not so great because it sort of has this removal, this distance from the development effort, which is not good.

22
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So now we know what to do in this area. We fix bugs while we're coding by testing and development.

23
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And this is the best way to avoid bugs in our applications, right?

24
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No.

25
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Did you notice that I learned how to make each bullet happen one at a time?

26
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So now you don't know what I'm going to say.

27
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's awesome.

28
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Not this menu item before.

29
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
No, definitely, absolutely, positively not.

30
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The least expensive place to fix bugs is when you're designing your software, which everybody does, yes?

31
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I will contend of all the things I'm saying here, which are very, very extremely fuzzy,

32
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
that without a doubt most of the big problems we have with software are problems of misconception.

33
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We don't have a good idea of what we're doing before we do it, and then go, go, go, go.

34
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And we do everything, you know, we have practices and all kinds of stuff, and we feel really good about ourselves after that point.

35
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But if you mess it up, you know, as Mark said, and step one is not going to turn out well.

36
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
There are not problems of implementation.

37
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
There are problems of implementation, obviously, and testing and other things help with those.

38
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But problems of misconception are not generally addressed by testing or type systems or the things we use to correct defects and implementation.

39
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There aren't really type systems that can tell us if we've got a good idea or what we're doing addresses that idea.

40
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So I'm going to talk a little bit about analysis and design.

41
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I know that's so 90s and ugly and was rightfully, you know, criticized and really dropped.

42
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Because, you know, when people considered it to be about process and drawing pictures and, you know, knowing everything about everything and making comprehensive plans

43
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and the waterfall model, and there was amazing amounts of stuff that was terrible about this.

44
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But that doesn't mean that the step before go do it is not an important step.

45
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And I think we don't spend enough time and energy or make enough time or get allocated time.

46
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You know, it may not be a matter of our choice.

47
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We'd say, well, we'd like to spend some time thinking about it, but, you know, we have to ship something next week.

48
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But we are definitely suffering in quality because we don't spend time here.

49
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And so what I'd like to do is sort of just whatever you think analysis and design is, I'd like you to just forget for the moment.

50
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And let's try to make a really simple definition.

51
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Analysis and design is about two things.

52
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Identifying some problem that we're trying to solve and assessing our proposed solution in terms of whether or not it solves that problem.

53
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's really what it's about.

54
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Not about anything else.

55
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We should be solving problems.

56
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We should not be building features.

57
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
There's nothing about feature.

58
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What is feature?

59
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Feature is just an attribute of something.

60
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's the shiny chrome knob on something.

61
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's not the purpose of the car.

62
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,000
There's no guarantee if you put together a feature list, even if it comes from the customer, that it's going to solve their own problem.

63
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Or that it solves any problem.

64
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Or that the features when you put them together don't introduce a whole ton of other problems.

65
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So programming and writing software is not about completing lists of features.

66
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:34,000
In particular, features provided by users, in spite of their best efforts to satisfy themselves, are often really not good ideas.

67
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And you've got to dig underneath it and figure out what problem they have and what's the best solution to it.

68
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And then reconcile it with whatever they ask for.

69
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We also have a tendency because we're all smart and we love being smart and figuring out how to make things go.

70
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Figuring out how to make something go is good no matter what it took to do it.

71
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So if we can find a way to get around a problem, we're like, that's great.

72
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And it's not great.

73
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Avoiding problems, which we're all capable of doing, very capable of doing, isn't the same as solving them.

74
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So we should really try to work on solving problems.

75
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And the thing I'm going to talk about today is really that there's a bunch of technique and skill to solving problems.

76
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And the first one is just to make an effort to understand the problem you're working on, to recognize, identify it, put it somewhere, and talk about it.

77
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So problem solving is definitely a skill.

78
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I think you shouldn't take away from this talk that there's a certain kind of person who's like good at problem solving and they get to do this part of the job.

79
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And then we can practice these other things.

80
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You can practice this part.

81
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Paya wrote this amazing book called How to Solve It in 1945 or something, which is about how to practice.

82
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And what are the techniques of solving math problems in this case?

83
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And it's a terrific book full of great insight.

84
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And if you've never read it, go on to Amazon right after my talk and order yourself a copy.

85
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
One of the things that's not so great about the book is that it is in the math space.

86
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And in that space, there's this really nice thing that happens.

87
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
When you're done and you think you have an answer, you have all the techniques of mathematical proof to determine if you actually have.

88
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Whereas as software developers, we don't have that.

89
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
There's no way to prove that you have a good solution to somebody's e-commerce site problem.

90
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
There's no mathematical techniques and there's not going to be any anytime soon.

91
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That will let us do that.

92
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But it is a skill and it is something you can practice, it's something you can learn about.

93
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And it's worth doing, right?

94
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Because as human beings, we get good at what we practice.

95
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It doesn't matter what it is, it's amazing examples of people practicing things

96
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,000
that they seem to have no potential hope to become good at and they get good at it because they practiced it.

97
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
If you practice problem solving, really practice problem solving, you will get good at it.

98
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
If you practice methodology X, you will get good at that.

99
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And I'd like you to ask yourself, where do you think there's more leverage?

100
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I don't care what X is, pick any X you want.

101
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Would you rather be good at it or the general skill of solving problems?

102
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So what do we need to do if we're going to work on solving problems?

103
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What is the activity like?

104
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The first thing is to actually say, I am solving this problem.

105
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
This problem is this, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and therefore blah.

106
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I have seen so much software made where no one ever said that.

107
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
No one ever wrote that down.

108
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And then we have a whole system and no one said what problem is supposed to solve.

109
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
If we're not solving problems, I have no idea why we're in this room.

110
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We absolutely should be working on solving problems, which means we should be enumerating what they are.

111
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And then from the mental standpoint, which I'll talk about a little bit later,

112
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
it is actually important to say them out loud.

113
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
As the person is trying to solve a problem, say it.

114
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Have a conversation with somebody in your group and say, we need to solve this.

115
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The problem is, blah, blah, blah, you know, rant or talk and have a little conversation or write it down.

116
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But just like you used the practice of repeating somebody's name or introducing them as a mnemonic

117
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
to help you remember their name, it's the same thing.

118
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
This is the seed of solving the problem is stating it.

119
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So the next part, which is definitely a trickier, and Paulia's book is great,

120
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and it's got a lot of practical things, many of these are overlap, what he said,

121
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
is to understand the problem.

122
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So we said, we have this problem.

123
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I think we need a no-SQL database.

124
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
There's something missing.

125
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We have this problem, we need a no-SQL database.

126
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,000
We haven't actually said, you know, why, what are the characteristics of this problem that lead us to this solution space?

127
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And this is where all the interesting work is, I think, in software development.

128
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And so the first step is, what do you know about what you're trying to do?

129
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
There's definitely going to be a bunch of facts.

130
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
There will be customer requirements, there'll be other things.

131
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
There'll be context, you know, the system has to run on this kind of box, has to run for this long.

132
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It can't consume more than this many watts or has to support 10 million users, whatever it is.

133
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
There are those kinds of things and constraints.

134
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
All this stuff are facts you know about what you're supposed to do.

135
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
There will be things that right away you know you don't know.

136
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I wonder where we're going to get the data as an input to this thing.

137
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What we're going to do when our main data source is not available, do we have a secondary thing?

138
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
There will be things like that.

139
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Of course, there will be things that you don't know or you don't know.

140
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Well, that's fair.

141
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But if there's things you don't know, you should think about them now.

142
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,000
The other thing to do is to say, you know, everybody says, you know, I have this great idea for excellence.

143
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You're the only person in the world that ever had this problem, so that's very, very unlikely.

144
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So go find some other solutions to similar problems.

145
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Are there any others that you know about and what can you find out about them?

146
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Because looking at other solutions to the same problem is the number one way to get up to speed really quickly

147
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and start working ahead of, you know, the best known solutions in this space.

148
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And then because what you'll have to do then will just be an incremental step above what the last guy did.

149
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But if you're ignoring what the last guy did, you're starting from scratch.

150
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So you definitely want to look around in the space.

151
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
All right, now I'm not advocating a methodology or anything.

152
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But if you're going to bother to do all this work, you should write it down.

153
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Somehow, some way. I don't care about it.

154
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The other thing you have to do is you have to be discerning. You have to be critical.

155
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And where it's sort of in this world, because it's all this community stuff, and it's like, I just hear awesome.

156
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's like awesome happens. I just hear it like 50 times a day.

157
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Not everything is awesome.

158
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And so it's hard to talk about other people's stuff not being awesome.

159
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
So just mainly focus on your own stuff.

160
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
In particular, as you're finding solutions, as you're trying to enumerate a solution to a problem,

161
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
look for defects in your own solution.

162
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And of course, you can have a whole talk about this because there will be technical errors,

163
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
there'll be errors in logic, there'll also be errors of taste and judgment and abstraction

164
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
and all those kinds of things that all feeds into this.

165
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And there's an entire talk in this area.

166
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:15,000
But whatever issues you can find in your own solutions, try to solve those too right away up front.

167
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
So the other thing you see is, oh, we're going to do this.

168
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Oh, that's great. It has these 10 attributes. It's awesome.

169
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's really easy to get excited about the good parts of what you do,

170
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
but you should be looking for trade-offs.

171
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
The chances of there being no trade-offs in any solution are slim.

172
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
The other thing is just this, again, this what don't you know thing.

173
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
If there's stuff you know you don't know, there are questions you should be asking

174
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
in order to find out what you don't know.

175
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You don't know everything.

176
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So there should be question marks on whatever it is you want to use

177
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
that you're going to write all this stuff down.

178
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
There should be question marks on that page.

179
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
If there are no question marks, you're missing the step.

180
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
The other thing is to think about none of us are born knowing how to write software.

181
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
None of us are born knowing about SQL or the characteristics of the web

182
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
or protocols or anything else.

183
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And if you're trying to solve a problem, especially in a space where you haven't done it before,

184
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
you're going to have a very limited ability to come up with solutions.

185
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
If you don't have a lot of input, you're going to need to get a lot of different inputs

186
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
so that you can let your brain go around between them and say,

187
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
oh, yeah, this idea and that idea are connected to each other,

188
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
and therefore I can do this other thing.

189
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
If you only take a really narrow slice of, I see exactly what I'm doing right now,

190
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
right this second, to deliver next week.

191
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You're not going to have enough inputs to make decisions.

192
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So you want to read about the kind of space that you're in, widely.

193
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Very specifically, oh, there's other people trying to do exactly the same thing,

194
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
and then broadly, these other characteristic problems,

195
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
and maybe even if you want, go try to find research papers that are kind of in the same space.

196
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's amazing the cool things you can find by searching something like ACM for papers about the kind of,

197
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
it's like, oh, I wonder if we could get a certain kind of hash code that does whatever.

198
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You go into Google and type hash code that does whatever, enter,

199
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
and if there's some scholarly and ACM references, grab those papers.

200
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Even if you only understand like a tiny fraction of the paper,

201
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
it's likely to contribute to your ability to think about your problem.

202
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
The other thing is, even if you're not going to tell the other guy,

203
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
when you're looking at other solutions, be extremely critical.

204
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I can't tell you how often you're going to find the next best idea

205
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
by completely crucifying the last guy's idea.

206
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
At least in your own head, right, take it apart.

207
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Because when you take it apart, you're going to find a couple of things

208
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
maybe they didn't write down when they were doing it.

209
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So, everybody says designs about trade-offs.

210
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Everybody knows this, right?

211
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Usually when they're talking about trade-offs and their software,

212
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
they're talking about the parts of their software that suck.

213
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I had to make these trade-offs.

214
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That is not what a trade-off is, right?

215
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You have to look at at least two solutions to your problem, at least two.

216
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And you have to figure out what's good and bad about those things, right?

217
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Before you can say, I made a trade-off.

218
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
So, I really recommend that you do that.

219
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And when you do it, you might want to write that down somewhere.

220
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Okay, so let's talk a little bit more about practice.

221
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
A big part of trying to do this work is maintaining your focus.

222
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
We had a really nice talk yesterday about flow,

223
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
and that is a kind of a focus-related concept.

224
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And when you're trying to do design work, you also need,

225
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I think some of the most extreme focus you're going to ever need.

226
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And so there's some cool aspects to the hammock.

227
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
One of the cool aspects to a hammock is that you can go on a hammock,

228
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
and you can close your eyes, and no one knows that you're not sleeping.

229
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
But they won't bother you because they think you might be sleeping.

230
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So it's very cool.

231
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Computers are bad, bad sources of distraction.

232
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
They're so bad, especially for people like us.

233
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's just like, wow.

234
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Something else, besides what I'm trying to think about,

235
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
you desperately need to get away from the computer if you're trying to focus.

236
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's almost impossible to focus sitting on a computer.

237
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
The other thing about focus is that you're going to be making trade-offs

238
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
when you try to focus really intensely.

239
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You're going to drop balls, you're going to miss calling people back

240
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
and responding to emails and doing your slides for conferences

241
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,000
until the airport on the way there, and things like that.

242
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
That's just the game.

243
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
The one thing, though, is that you should communicate to people

244
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
that you care about about this process,

245
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and the fact that when you're doing it, you're going to seem pretty far away.

246
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And that's not a comment about the person that you care about.

247
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's just the nature of doing this kind of work.

248
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So it is important to sort of do it.

249
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
A lot of people will not get time to do this all day, every day,

250
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
or over the course of an entire week,

251
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
but if you're going to get some focus time, define what that is.

252
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Everybody knows about time-out time for little kids.

253
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What programmers need this focus time?

254
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
They're like, little kids that need to go sit on the hammock

255
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
and have nobody bother them.

256
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:15,000
So for me personally, I think that the process involves two parts of your mind.

257
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And this is stuff that you're seeing.

258
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
There's books written about this and whatever.

259
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I haven't read them, but they seem to correspond to my personal experience,

260
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
which is that you sort of have this waking mind and background mind.

261
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And your waking mind is really good at that criticizing part.

262
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's extremely analytical and it's very, very good at tactics.

263
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Right now, we need to make a decision.

264
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The lion is chasing after us, jumped left.

265
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
We are really good at that.

266
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
That's what our waking mind is about, keeping us alive

267
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
and making short-term decisions

268
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
and looking at the immediately present information

269
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
and doing something about it.

270
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Or if you think you're going to sit down and look at a problem for the first time

271
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
and stare at your computer and do whatever

272
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
and have a conversation for 10 minutes and make a really great decision,

273
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I don't think so.

274
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I know I can't do that.

275
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Definitely not.

276
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
The problem with this kind of thing is it tends to push uphill.

277
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Ooh, I see this.

278
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Ooh, I see that.

279
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Okay, here I have a choice left and right.

280
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Okay, I can go right.

281
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That's more up.

282
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Left and right.

283
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Left, that's more up.

284
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
More up.

285
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
This part of your thinking is really good at finding the local maximum.

286
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
But it's not very good at getting off the track.

287
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's on and finding the fact that there's another hill over there

288
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
that really takes you higher.

289
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
But there's a very, very critical activity that you have to engage in,

290
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I think, if you want to use your entire brain

291
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
and become very good at problem solving.

292
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And that is to think about using your waking time

293
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
to assign tasks to your background line.

294
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
To actually think hard about something

295
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
and create work for your background line.

296
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
That really is the point of the hammock and all this listening

297
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
and all this working and talking about that you're going to do when you're awake

298
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
is actually to give the other half of you stuff to do.

299
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
The other good thing about your waking mind is when you do think

300
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
you have a great idea that you've caught up with in your background mind,

301
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
your waking mind is good at picking the other part.

302
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Saying, you know, you thought you woke up with this brilliant idea,

303
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
but now I'm seeing this characteristic of it that seems not so brilliant.

304
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
So let's talk about the background mind.

305
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm not going to directly equate it with the sleeping mind,

306
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
but the sleeping mind is the number one instance of the background mind.

307
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You can find access to your background mind during the day while you're awake,

308
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
but it's tricky.

309
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's good at making connections, right?

310
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
The kind of thing like, if I make a hut out of mud and it rains hard,

311
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
it will disintegrate.

312
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It's not necessarily the kind of thing that you can tactically figure out.

313
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Your background mind is going to know sort of aspects of all those different components

314
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
that make the connections and synthesize them.

315
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Even when you think you're really hot at making decisions on the fly,

316
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
you're almost always just regurgitating something your background mind has already figured out.

317
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
So the background mind is good at synthesizing things.

318
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It's good about strategy, right?

319
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And so when Mark talks about, you know, abstractions and things like that,

320
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
abstractions are our software strategy, right?

321
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Because the idea there is you're making some super global decision

322
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
that's going to need to be corrected in a whole bunch of contexts

323
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
in which you can't make tactical decisions yet.

324
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
What does it mean to make an abstraction you're going to derive libraries from?

325
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
What does it mean to put something in a programming language

326
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
where I had no idea what you guys were going to do with it?

327
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It's a more strategic kind of thing.

328
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
You don't build a programming language and say,

329
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
how will this programming language deal with HTTP requests?

330
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
What you want to do is give Mark something that he can use

331
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
when he's got a tactical decision to make about HTTP requests.

332
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And that's a strategic kind of thinking.

333
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And your background mind is good at strategic thinking.

334
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
If you want to do abstraction, you have to find time to do this thinking

335
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
because that's the part your brain comes from, right?

336
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
It does abstraction, it draws analogies, right?

337
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I think this is where you solve most non-trivial problems, okay?

338
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
You can make good decisions in the moment otherwise,

339
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
but if you're really trying to solve something hard,

340
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
you've got to engage the other half of your head.

341
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
So I'm not just saying a scientific American.

342
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Say that when we're sleeping, we process the information during the day

343
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
because that's pretty obvious.

344
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
But that sleep reinforces memory, which is good.

345
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I mean, it is important to remember what you're working on.

346
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
But more importantly, it is a great sorter out of things.

347
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
So we had this whole...

348
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I just advocated taking a lot of input, right?

349
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Taking a lot of input, doing all this analysis of the requirements in the space, right?

350
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Doing all the reading, looking at competitive solutions and tearing them apart.

351
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
There's this ton of stuff.

352
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
When are you going to decide what about that is important and what isn't?

353
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
When you're asleep.

354
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
That's what happens.

355
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Evolution has solved this problem for us.

356
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And that's the solution it came up with.

357
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
We can't ignore it.

358
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
We have to use it.

359
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
But the most critical thing is this one.

360
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Finding hidden relations and solving problems we were working on.

361
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So imagine somebody says,

362
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I have this problem, this, that, that, that, that, that, that.

363
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And you look at it for 10 minutes and say,

364
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
okay, I'm going to go out to the movies and do something else.

365
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Then you go to sleep.

366
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Are you going to solve that problem when you're asleep?

367
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Sure.

368
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
No.

369
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Or you didn't think about it, did you?

370
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
No, you didn't think about it.

371
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You didn't think about it hard enough while you were awake

372
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
for it to become important to your mind when you were asleep.

373
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And this goes back to that feeding your background mind thing.

374
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
You really do have to work hard.

375
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Just think, not typing it in.

376
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Just thinking about a problem during the day

377
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
so that it becomes an agenda item for your background mind.

378
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
That's how it works, right?

379
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
It's when people are out there and they're like,

380
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
oh my God, how am I going to find food?

381
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And this is happening there.

382
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
But I know I saw an elk over there.

383
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
They seem to be by the water sometimes or whatever.

384
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
That's when you wake up as a caveman and say,

385
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
let's go hunt for the animals by the water.

386
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
It's not a logical deduction.

387
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
It seems like that when your foreground mind is sort of analyzing it.

388
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
But there's no logic for that necessarily.

389
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
It's really a process of this very parallel kind of thinking.

390
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So this is very important.

391
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
So we have a problem in general because we write,

392
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
and we're just being asked to write stuff for this,

393
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
more and more complex as time goes by.

394
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And we know there's a 7 plus or minus 2 sort of working memory limit.

395
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And as smart as any of us are, we all suffer from the same limit.

396
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
But the problems that we're called upon to solve

397
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
are much bigger than that normally.

398
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
So what do we do?

399
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
If we can't fit the whole thing in our head at the same time,

400
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:56,000
how can we work on a problem with more than nine components?

401
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
What I'm going to recommend is that you write all the bits down.

402
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Especially now, you've written a lot down about the problem.

403
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
What the problem is, a lot of facts about it, constraints about where it runs.

404
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
You don't know, you've asked yourself those questions, you wrote them down.

405
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I wish I knew a blog.

406
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
You looked at competitive things and said,

407
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
that works great over here, but that part of that competitive thing sucks.

408
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I hate that.

409
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I wish that wasn't there.

410
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You gave this huge agenda to your background line.

411
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And when you're trying to load it up, you need to survey.

412
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And that's the point of writing it all down before.

413
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
If you've written all this stuff down, including some sketch of how you want to solve the problem,

414
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
you can go and jump around and look at that.

415
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It's sort of like, how many balls can you juggle?

416
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Well, you can only juggle so many.

417
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I can't juggle at all.

418
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
But if we look at the 7 plus or minus 2 thing, we can juggle 7 to 9 balls.

419
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
But if you can imagine having an assistant,

420
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
who every now and then could take one of those out and put a different color in,

421
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
then you could juggle balls of 20 different colors at the same time,

422
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
as long as there were only 9 in the air at any one point in time.

423
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And that's what you're doing.

424
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,000
You're going to sort of look around at all these pieces and shift arbitrary shapes of 7

425
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
into your head at different points in time.

426
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Maybe you'll draw pictures.

427
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Don't use the UML tool to do this.

428
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Damn.

429
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
It's not a methodology.

430
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So go over and over.

431
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
But then you must, again, step away from the computer.

432
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
There's another really important part of doing this,

433
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
which is to go and sit somewhere and have no input.

434
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And close your eyes and not go to sleep.

435
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Close your eyes.

436
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Because we have this other thing.

437
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Everybody knows what it is.

438
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It's really hard to describe.

439
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
But does everybody have a concept of their mind's eye?

440
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
What you see when you close your eyes and you start thinking about something,

441
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
it's this weird, I mean, it's not actually technically visual,

442
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
although some people are really vibrantly visual.

443
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I know for me, it's, I don't know.

444
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I can't describe it, but it's not very realistic.

445
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
But you need to do that.

446
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
That part is important for your brain.

447
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Because at that point, you're switching out of sort of an input reception mode.

448
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
If you're just looking at your list, you're sort of in the mode of,

449
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I'm getting input.

450
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
But when you're sitting and contemplating something and hashing it over in your head,

451
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
you don't have any other input, which means you're exercising the recall.

452
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I looked at those 20 points.

453
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Let's say it was just 20.

454
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I looked at those 20 points over and over and over again.

455
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And I jumped around with input between them.

456
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Now I close my eyes and I'm trying to recall them and think about them a little bit more in my head.

457
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And you're going to find if you've done the last step going over and over,

458
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
you will actually be able to sit on a hammock and pull all the different parts

459
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
of a fairly large problem in and out of your head, admittedly, maybe one at a time.

460
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And think about them that way.

461
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
That exercise is really, really important.

462
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I don't know why it just is because it forces this recall thing

463
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
that definitely makes those things agenda items for your background mind.

464
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So we'll call that mind's eye time.

465
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Now you're done.

466
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Cake is in the oven.

467
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
You just have to wait.

468
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
It's so good.

469
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And one of the things I would say is at least wait overnight.

470
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
No matter how ill you and your buddies talked about it and you just feel like such a hot shot today,

471
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I have got this thing.

472
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Sleep on it at least one night, at least if it's an important decision.

473
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Now, how many people woke up this morning with the answer to a hard problem?

474
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
You see, it's science.

475
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Science at work.

476
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
No, it's really kind of an unfortunate thing.

477
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
If you're not thinking about this, do you think what happened?

478
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I worked hard all day.

479
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I'm done working.

480
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Time to relax.

481
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Unfortunately, if you believe in what I'm saying today,

482
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
you're actually doing something kind of important when you're sleeping.

483
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
So occasionally, you really have to give your brain a chance to do that other part of the job.

484
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
If you always deny it, I don't think you're going to have the best results.

485
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Unfortunately, sometimes overnight is not enough.

486
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Some big problems, especially finding really good abstractions,

487
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
are finding answers to things that satisfy a bunch of simultaneous constraints,

488
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
take a long time.

489
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
It just does.

490
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
And I know everybody has to ship and everything else,

491
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
and in that case, I'll have what I'm saying doesn't apply.

492
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And like I said before, I consider it a huge opportunity

493
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
when I get an extended amount of time to think about a problem,

494
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
because I know I'll come up with a better answer.

495
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
But one of the ways you can deal with this and not get stymied by,

496
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
well, let me just think about that for three months,

497
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:21,000
because most managers are not incredibly receptive to that sentence.

498
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
So to just work on more than one thing,

499
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
not inside one day,

500
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
try to work on one thing each day.

501
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
But if over the course of time, you have like three projects,

502
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
it's quite possible to load one up and work on it for three days,

503
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
and finding answers to any of your question mark items

504
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
are able to enumerate new possibilities.

505
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
So you kind of stuck a little bit,

506
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
you switch to another project and do that for a few days.

507
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
You have to amortize the loading up time,

508
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
it can take between an hour and an entire day to load up something.

509
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
So once you've done that, you try to get at least the rest of the day,

510
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
or three days or more on it.

511
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
But don't get hung up about the stuck thing, just switch.

512
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Don't stay stuck, switch.

513
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Or get more input, talk about it more,

514
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
or keep stimulating the pathway, don't stay stuck on it.

515
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
But yeah, then eventually cake comes out of the oven.

516
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
You wake up and you have a great idea,

517
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
you think you know the answer to your problem,

518
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
or you have a good idea for a solution.

519
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Unfortunately, sometimes you have an answer to,

520
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
not the problem you were working on,

521
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
you were working on three projects and you loaded up the project C

522
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
and you woke up with the answer to project A.

523
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
That has to be okay.

524
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
You just switch and take advantage of it, at least capture it.

525
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
If you wake up with an answer to some other thing

526
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
that you can't work on that day,

527
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
capture the results of this background process,

528
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
they're really useful.

529
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Finally, you do have to take your great ideas

530
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
and figure out if they're actually great

531
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
by either analyzing them more, which is certainly important,

532
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
but sometimes you have to write them and type them into your computer.

533
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Actually, we all have to do this.

534
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
So you do eventually have to code.

535
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
It's fun, Stu has this great sense,

536
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
he's seen some of my design sheets,

537
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
and I don't know what it says,

538
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
document of despair or something.

539
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
It seems to be all like,

540
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
we can't do this, this doesn't work like that,

541
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
the question marks, blah, blah, blah.

542
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
It's all negative, but it's all challenges

543
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
to the problem-solving process.

544
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
It's not despairing, it's positive,

545
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
it's saying, I know what my challenges are,

546
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
and therefore I can work on it.

547
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
But you spit this thing out,

548
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,000
now you have something, so you try to avoid a lot of typing.

549
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I know I do.

550
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Because if I think I've got an answer

551
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
and the answer is small,

552
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
that's one of the most telling attributes

553
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
that is probably good.

554
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And what I would hope from doing this whole process

555
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
is that you gain confidence in it

556
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
after you've seen it work for you,

557
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
so that you say, you know what,

558
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I have never done this before,

559
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
but I really have thought about it,

560
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
and this solution I came up with overnight feels awesome,

561
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
and woo, let's go.

562
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
It is important to look at what you did

563
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
and to run it and see

564
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
and find out new things about the solution

565
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
and say, you know what, I had this supposition,

566
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
it's not correct, I thought it would have this characteristic,

567
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
it doesn't, et cetera, et cetera,

568
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I am not advocating the waterfall model,

569
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
you're going to try stuff and go back,

570
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
that's fine.

571
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
But don't lean on this, right?

572
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Test-driven dentistry,

573
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I don't think I can come up with a better thing.

574
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
We can't really do that.

575
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
The last thing is

576
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
you are going to be wrong.

577
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I am frequently wrong.

578
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
That's part of the game.

579
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
You're going to think of better ideas.

580
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I think that's one of the most exciting things.

581
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I think no matter what I've ever thought of,

582
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
the fact that I know I'm going to think of something better,

583
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
as much as it will suck a little bit

584
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
because I know I delivered something that was not the best,

585
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
means that I'm still going.

586
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
It's still working.

587
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So you will think of better ideas.

588
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Also, the facts change.

589
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
They can change because of two reasons, right?

590
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
One, you missed some of them early on,

591
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
so they're new to you because you skipped them.

592
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
What else do we have?

593
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Changing requirements, right?

594
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
It's just, you know, we all know this.

595
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
The facts will change.

596
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
When the facts change, do not dig in.

597
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Do it over again and see if your answer is still valid

598
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
in the context of the new requirements and new facts.

599
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And if it isn't, change your mind and don't apologize.

600
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Sometimes you'll just make mistakes,

601
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
errors in logic or, you know, you just get it wrong.

602
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
That's fine.

603
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
If I can advocate anything, it's do not be afraid,

604
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
especially do not be afraid of being wrong.

605
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So, in summary, this was a rant.

606
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
There's no summary.

607
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I have two minutes for questions.

608
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Yes.
