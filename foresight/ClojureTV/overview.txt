1. **Map**: Apply a function to every item in a collection and return a new collection with the results. It's shorthand for iterating over each element manually.

2. **Apply**: Not only applies a function to each item but also passes along the resulting sequence as arguments to the function. This is a powerful feature of dynamic languages that allows for more concise and expressive code.

3. **Interpose**: Inserts elements between every pair of items in a collection and returns a new list with the inserted elements. The separator can be any value or expression.

4. **Stir** (`(apply stir)`): A function that takes a sequence of items and concatenates them into a single string, separated by commas or another chosen delimiter.

5. **Reduce**: Applies a binary operation to each pair of adjacent items in the collection, returning a single value after the operation is applied across the entire collection. It's similar to summing a list of numbers with `+`.

6. **Cycle**: Returns a sequence (lazy or infinite) along with a function that, when called, will produce the next item in the sequence according to the specified pattern. It's useful for repeating patterns without consuming all the resources immediately.

7. **Closure**: A function object that remembers its environment during creation and can be passed around and invoked later, potentially many times. It's important to understand that `cycle` returns a sequence along with a function that knows how to generate more values when needed, rather than creating an infinite list upfront.

8. **Character Literals**: In some languages, like Python, you use single quotes for character literals and double quotes for strings. In Clojure, as demonstrated with `\s`, you can use a backslash followed by the desired character to create a character literal when a character is not easily typed or is not a standard single-character quote.

The examples shown how these functions can be combined to perform complex operations in a concise and readable manner, leveraging the power of functional programming in Clojure.

 Certainly! The key points from the rant about the process of problem-solving and development are as follows:

1. **The Incubation Process**: Sometimes, after immersing yourself in a problem without an answer, you'll find that the solution comes to you unexpectedly, often when you're not actively thinking about it. This is a natural part of the problem-solving process and should be embraced.

2. **Documenting Ideas**: Capture your ideas, even if they seem negative or like design sheets of despair. These documents challenge the problem-solving process and help you understand the issues at hand.

3. **Avoid Overthinking**: Resist the temptation to overanalyze or type too much during the initial stages of idea generation. Trust your instincts and the subconscious thought processes that occur during incubation.

4. **Confidence in the Process**: Gain confidence in this non-linear, iterative process by experiencing its effectiveness firsthand. Learn from each iteration, not just from the successes but also from the mistakes.

5. **Testing and Adaptation**: Implement your solutions, test them, and be prepared to adapt based on what you learn. This iterative approach is crucial for refining ideas and achieving better outcomes.

6. **Embrace Being Wrong**: Accept that being wrong is a natural part of the process and that new information, changing requirements, or simply having more complete information can lead to better solutions. Be open to change your mind when necessary.

7. **Continuous Improvement**: Remember that every idea you think of now may be improved upon later, and that's a positive aspect of the creative process. Always strive for improvement and innovation.

In essence, the rant encourages embracing the non-linear nature of creativity and problem-solving, being open to unexpected solutions, and understanding that the process involves iteration, adaptation, and continuous learning from both successes and failures.

Checking ClojureTV/＂Design, Composition, and Performance＂ by Rich Hickey (2013).txt
1. **Design Imagination vs. Constraints**: Design involves imagining a lot of possibilities within the constraints you have. It's about embracing limitations as tools that will help shape your solutions, rather than hindrances that limit creativity. The key is to generate many ideas and then select from them.

2. **Making Decisions**: After generating a wide range of potential solutions, it's crucial to make decisions. Design is about making those choices and communicating them clearly so that the next person can trust and build upon your work without unnecessary complexity.

3. **Design Sensibility in Performance**: Similar to how Coltrane applied his understanding of music theory and analysis to his performances, designers should bring a design sensibility to their coding. This means considering how each part interacts with others at different levels, from the smallest details to the larger structures.

4. **Instruments as Simple Tools**: Instruments are simple in a deep way—they're designed to be intuitive and expressive. Software languages and libraries should aspire to this quality by being straightforward and supportive of creative expression.

5. **Coding Like Coltrane**: When coding, apply a harmonic sensibility, thinking about how code components fit together cohesively. This approach ensures that the final product is maintainable, changeable, and reusable.

6. **Pursuing Harmony**: In software design, it's important to consider how different elements work together harmoniously. This means not just solving immediate problems but thinking about the long-term implications of your code, its maintainability, and its adaptability.

In essence, the talk emphasizes the importance of a thoughtful approach to design that combines imagination with decision-making, and applies principles of simplicity, cohesion, and harmony in both software development and performance.
