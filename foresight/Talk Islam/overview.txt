Checking Talk Islam/Social Media is making us depressed.txt
 The reflections here highlight a paradox where despite the connectivity that social media platforms offer, they often lead to feelings of depression and loneliness. The suggestion is to step away from digital interactions and engage in real-world, face-to-face social interactions, particularly within the context of the Islamic faith.

The text emphasizes the importance of physically going to the places of worship (masjids), leaving homes and phones behind, and interacting with others in person. It encourages Muslims to greet one another with salam, not just those they know but also strangers, as a means of fostering community and connection.

The narrative then references a Hadith where the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the significance of visiting friends for the sake of Allah, without expecting anything in return. The Hadith describes an encounter with an angel who informs the person visiting his friend that Allah loves him as much as he loves his friend, simply because he visited out of love and not for personal gain.

The overarching message is that the Islamic faith offers a comprehensive solution to social issues like loneliness and isolation, and by adhering to its teachings, individuals can find relief from these modern-day challenges. The author prays for alleviation of these feelings among all, including youth and the elderly, and for peace and well-being in society as a whole.

The text concludes with Islamic greetings of peace, mercy, and blessings upon the reader.
