0	4640	Imagine if your phone could see for you. This could be really useful in low visibility situations,
4640	8640	but more than anything, it should be useful for people who are blind. This should be possible
8640	12960	because smartphones and tablets have some pretty incredible sensors in them. They know where they
12960	17440	are in space and what's around them. If you could somehow communicate what the phone is seeing
17440	21040	with an interface that doesn't require a screen, something you can touch or hear,
21040	24880	it could actually be a pretty good replacement set of eyes. I've been thinking if I could do that,
24880	28560	it might actually be useful invention in contrast to a lot of the stuff I make.
28640	32960	It took me a few tries, but I did eventually get a system working. This iPad is running an app
32960	38160	that I wrote, which is talking to a kind of unusual case for it. And what it does is it's
38160	43120	communicating what it sees into my hand through a tactile interface right here. This allows me to
43120	46800	walk around blindfolded and not hit things. I think if I refined it a little bit more,
46800	50640	it could be a Braille display. It doesn't have enough resolution to do that right now, but
50640	55440	there's no reason it couldn't, I don't think. So inside of this, there's a pretty cool mechanism,
55440	59680	which I'll show you. I also spent way too much engineering time trying to prank my wife. She's
59680	64800	kind of on red alert now, so I had to come up with a complicated scheme to get her right where I
64800	68800	wanted her. So as usual, this project was a lot harder than I was thinking that it was going to
68800	72000	be. Yeah, because you did it the hard way. If you just would have used a bunch of motors,
72000	75680	like I said, it would have been a whole lot easier that way. No, what we should have done
75680	79200	is made an entirely new actuator from scratch. I'm telling you, night and all is the future.
79200	83440	All right, all right. So I did have a lot of internal debate on the best way to build this thing.
83440	88480	There's actually several different, all good ways to build this. I went with this approach
88480	92400	because I thought it was the most interesting. There's a really cool mechanism inside of here.
93040	97040	I also want to thank San Juan Steve for nerd sniping me with this idea and the comments
97040	102160	from my last video. Also, thank you for having a name that is WorkSafe San Juan Steve. This totally
102160	106800	distracted me from the project I was working on, which is making myself better at playing this violin
106800	111440	with the help of some robotics. It may still be on hold because I have a couple of other really
111440	116400	interesting projects that are competing for my attention. So I've been thinking a lot about
116400	122400	guided missiles and if there might be any kind of constructive uses for them. And I finally think
122400	128960	I have it. So imagine building the Iron Man gauntlet that flies like a rocket onto Tony Stark's hand.
128960	134320	I've been thinking about this problem. Definitely is dangerous, but I think it might be borderline
134320	139040	possible. That would be really cool. I'm also really interested in the idea of a baseball bat
139040	144560	that doubles or triples the power of my swing with the assistance of a very modest explosive
144560	149360	charge. I think I have a legal and interesting way to do that as well. If any of those things sound
149360	155040	cool, you should subscribe. I give you my word that I will build some all or none of those things.
155040	159600	I promise. Oh yeah. And I did finally set up a Patreon. If you want to help support me making
159600	164640	more awesome things and videos, this is a great way to do that. These videos do typically take
164640	169360	more than a hundred hours each and also quite a bit of money and material and tooling and other
169360	173760	things. In exchange, I'll be giving more behind the scenes info and in-depth project stuff. So
173760	177280	if that's interesting, there's a link in the description. All right, back to the project.
177280	182880	I calculate that this thing gives me roughly 20-1200 vision. Not the best, but it's better than
182880	188320	nothing. What 20-1200 vision means is that if I look at something with this, that's 20 feet away,
188320	193280	it will look as clear as it would look to someone if I took that thing and moved it 1200 feet away.
193280	196720	Going into this project, I really wasn't sure how I was going to do the sensing.
196720	201600	I was looking at using sonar sensors and off-the-shelf lidar unit. I was strongly
201600	205840	considering using the Kinect, but seriously, where are you going to put this thing? Are you
205840	210560	going to ask someone to just wear this on their head? You look like a complete idiot. Think about
210560	214400	how people would treat you if you walked down the street with this on your head. The goal of this
214400	220480	project is maybe something that could help humanity not hurt it. And I then remembered that the new
220480	224880	iPad has a lidar in it, which is awesome. The only problem is that it's only the latest iPad that
224880	229120	has the lidar in it, and I don't have one. And if you really think about it, I don't have a choice
229120	236240	here. I have to get this. It's to help humanity. Really? Humanity? It's going to help blind people.
236240	238960	Let's think about it. Fine.
242000	245440	Lidar is one of those things that if it didn't exist and you proposed it to me as an engineer,
245440	249520	I would laugh you out of the room. It just does not seem like it should exist. It's kind of like
249520	254800	ball screws where if you look at how they work, it still seems like magic. Lidar is crazy because
254800	259680	it measures the time that it takes light to travel from the iPad to an object, reflect off it, and
259680	265680	then come back. And this is crazy because light is mind-bogglingly fast. It's going around 670
265680	270480	million miles per hour. Unless it's light in the EU or Canada, in which case it's going about a
270480	275520	billion kilometers per hour. So the time that it takes to go from the iPad to a wall is on the
275520	280160	order of 5 nanoseconds. And to actually measure distance, you have to measure much more precisely
280160	284480	than this. The Lidar is actually sending out beams of light in all directions. It gives you a bunch
284480	288400	of measurements on the surface of everything that it sees and how far away it is from the iPad.
288960	293680	So this is an incredibly powerful technique for perceiving the world. It's how most self-driving
293680	297680	cars actually figure out what's around them. The other big architectural question I had to figure
297680	302160	out is how do I communicate what the thing is seeing using touch? The proposal in the comments
302160	307840	was to use some kind of vest, but my limited experience with nerves and humans is that
307840	312560	your torso isn't actually very good at sensing. So we're going to do a two-point discrimination
312560	320400	test. Tell me if you feel one or two touches. One. It's just so funny. I'm like jabbing you with two
320400	325600	screwdrivers. I know it's just how your body works, but it's really kind of funny. All right,
325600	330080	now turn around so I can test the front. That's probably not such a good idea, is it?
330800	335680	Your back isn't so great for tactile input, but your hands are incredible.
335680	339040	Not only do they have good resolutions, they can distinguish lots of touches.
339040	342640	They also are extremely sensitive. If this device could be a phone case,
342640	346480	I think that's legitimately more useful. A vest, you have to wear it and have all
346480	350960	these sensors, whereas your phone, you just have your phone and it helps you see.
351600	354800	So let's imagine that the iPad is seeing this. It's a room with a door and a chair.
354800	359280	What I do is I convert this into the simplest representation possible for navigating the space.
359280	363120	Right here, there's something that you don't want to hit. That's very close. That's the chair.
363120	367360	I have some stuff that's further. That's the walls. And then everywhere else is clear.
367360	371840	I can actually communicate this into your hand because there's not so much information.
371840	376560	If something is really close, I push really hard on your fingers at those corresponding
376560	382080	locations. If something is there but not as close, I can push not as hard. Where it's clear,
382080	385760	I don't push at all. This gives me basically a course map of what's going on in the world
385760	390240	on my hand. So I also made a couple different views. So if you want to zoom in and get more
390240	396560	detail, I have the ability to zoom. I also have an experimental top-down view. So this is the chair,
396560	401200	this is the wall, looking down from above. I can say that this is no go. This is open.
402000	405760	And these areas are unknown because I can't see through the walls with the lidar.
405760	411040	Remember, I'm looking from this perspective so I can only see what I can see through the doorway.
411040	414720	I can communicate this to the hand the same way I do the other view. It's just a different view
414720	418720	of the room. This view is kind of like the little mini-map in a first-person shooter in the bottom
418720	422000	of the screen, if you know what I'm talking about. I think this could be a pretty nice view with more
422000	427360	improvement. But this problem of things blocking other things happens a lot in practice. And so
427360	431360	it can be really difficult to interpret what you're looking at. To make this work, I had to find a way
431360	436960	to poke all of my fingers simultaneously with a controllable amount of poke. And that's hard
436960	443520	because I would like this to be an iPhone case. And that means I really, this is about as big as I
443520	447920	can go, kind of a grip shape. So if I just try to do the simple thing and cram a bunch of servo
447920	452400	motors in here, attach to each pin, there's just no way that's going to fit. Especially if I try to
452400	456800	scale it up so that it can be a Braille display, which I think is important and very useful. So
456800	460640	the big challenge for this project was finding a way to move all those pins with a compact and
460640	464880	ideally simple system. So what I wanted to do is make something that had a little metal pin that
464880	470000	I could push into every joint of every finger. And the way that I did this, imagine that I have one
470000	474640	of the pins that I want to move pressed against a cylinder that I can rotate. If I attach a little
474640	480480	wedge to this cylinder, when it goes underneath this pin, it's going to force it up. Then if I make
480480	485600	an even bigger wedge and I move my cylinder over, I can spin the cylinder and then push this pin
485600	490480	up even higher. All that I have to be able to do is can is rotate the cylinder and shift it left
490480	495520	and right to control how high up this pin goes. And then because it's a cylinder, I can pack
496080	500800	lots of ramps and lots of pins into it very compactly. Here's what some well-used ramps look
500800	506720	like IRL. That big bump next to them is used to trigger the pin locking and unlocking mechanism.
506720	511280	It's basically another ramp. And this keeps the pins in place when they're not under a ramp. And
511280	515760	then you can see that I can control where the cylinder goes with two opposing motors. By driving
515760	520640	them together, it rotates. And by driving only one of them, I can move it left and right. Planning
520640	524960	the motor moves for this system is a lot harder than I expected. Mostly because I wanted to move
524960	530960	one motor at a continuous speed and then have the other one keeping pace. It was a lot of quadratic
530960	540880	equations. And now the pain and joy of making this in 60 seconds or less.
540880	556800	Ah, why?
570880	586800	Ah.
590960	594560	This is the electronics. And the only thing that really mattered for proving the system is that
594560	599840	they work. So I made zero attempts at miniaturizing them. And they're very simple. They're just a
599840	604800	microcontroller Bluetooth communication module and then two big fat stepper motor drivers. If I
604800	608480	was trying to make this a real product, I'd be trying to fit it onto a little circuit board, which
608480	613600	there's no reason it couldn't. This is just what I had on hand. I should also point out that these
613600	618400	motors are massively overkill for the application. It doesn't take much power to raise a little pin.
618400	622160	I went with these partially because they're what I had on hand and also because
622160	625440	it's convenient to have a lot of extra power when you're prototyping. Now we don't worry about
625440	629840	stalling and other stuff. It's been almost a decade since I last wrote an iPad app.
629840	634880	And it's gotten a lot easier. And this is the app. It's really quite simple. I have all the
634880	639440	controls on the side for the different views and for zooming. And these are all accessible when
639440	643760	you're holding the grip on the side. There's a little preview of the depth data. And this just
643760	648480	helps me see what's going on. Ideally this would be running on a phone, but the LiDAR is only in
648480	652640	the iPad. If Apple puts the LiDAR on the iPhone, you could imagine it could just be a phone with
652640	656880	a little case on it, which would be really cool. That's pretty much all there is to this app.
656880	661600	Apple makes it really easy to work with LiDAR data. I spent a lot more time on the embedded system
661600	666320	trying to get the motor profiles working. And it was kind of wasted time, but I spent probably more
666320	671200	time trying to get wife mode working than anything else in this app. I really wanted to see my wife
671200	676240	walk into something. So I set it up to initially tell her correct data. Then after a bit start giving
676240	684160	her bad data. Probably just a bug. It's a complicated system. This thing is really weird to use.
684160	688240	It's a lot less intuitive than I was thinking it would be. You can feel all the pokes, but
688240	693280	I think about every finger and what it's feeling to try to create a mental image of what's in front
693280	698400	of me. Although I do think that if you used it a lot, it might become second nature. I remember
698400	703040	learning the type was pretty similar to this. It also lets you see things like overhead obstructions.
703040	706960	So you can get under them. Although it's since it's only giving two levels of depth, it was hard
706960	711760	for me to figure out where the obstruction actually was. So and you can see me pointing the iPad up
711760	717120	to see if there's anything above me. I would really like to see more touch points and more control
717120	720960	of those touch points because you really can feel the difference between these different pin
720960	724960	pressures. I think you could get a much nicer picture of what's around you if they could push
724960	729360	with more granularity. If I was doing another revision or trying to make this as a product,
729360	734320	I would be trying to find some little tiny actuator that I could buy that would allow me to
734320	738880	directly control every pin. I think it's a cool proof of concept and hopefully you'll like it as
738880	743280	well. So a lot of people have pointed out that I have a lot of tools and that I may in fact even
743280	747520	have a problem, which is probably true, but I would have an even bigger problem if all my tools got
747520	752240	stolen. Though I do spend a lot less time worrying thanks to this video sponsor Simply Safe. I spent
752240	756400	most of my adult life and my adult dollars building out this shop and the idea of someone
756400	761040	busting in and stealing my tools makes me want to curl up and die. Although let's be real, if
761040	765200	someone manages to steal this, they can have it. I'm only joking. That is not a challenge. Please
765200	769680	don't rob me. Although if you do try to rob me, you're busted because Simply Safe detects basically
769680	773840	every possible intrusion and calls the police immediately. You're going to kick down my door.
773840	776880	You just triggered my entry sensor. You're going to break my window. You just triggered my glass
776880	780720	brake sensor. You're going to cut a hole through my wall. Say hello to my motion sensor. Then wave
780720	784160	to me and the police dispatch on my HD security camera. You're going to try to break in when the
784160	788400	system is disarmed. Boom. Got a panic button. Simply Safe protects against outsiders, but it also
788400	792720	protects against me. And honestly, with all the stuff I get up to, I'm probably the biggest danger
792720	796080	here. I've got a fire alarm. If I accidentally leave a smoldering heap in the basement that
796080	800480	catches fire once I'm gone, I'm going to get notified. Got a carbon monoxide sensor. If I
800480	804240	leave my jet engine running and it makes a bunch of carbon monoxide, it's going to let me know
804240	808320	before it kills me. The number one thing for me though is the automatic deadbolt. The number of
808320	812960	times I've come back to see if the shop is actually locked is way too high. You get notified if you
812960	817280	forget to lock the door. You can lock it remotely. You can check it. Super handy. So if I was going
817280	820720	to rob your house, the first thing I'd do is I'd cut your power and your telephone. Although if
820720	825440	you had Simply Safe, I'd be a fool because it has a battery backup and uses cell service. It's super
825440	829120	reliable. It's usually ordered online or over the phone and they ship it straight to your house.
829120	832960	You stick the sensors wherever you want them and hit a few buttons and that's about it. It doesn't
832960	837280	even take an hour. And it's only 50 cents a day with no contract. That's cheaper than my previous
837280	841680	security system which had a contract. So have a lot more peace of mind with Simply Safe, knowing
841680	845840	that you're protected around the clock from basically anything you can think of. Visit
