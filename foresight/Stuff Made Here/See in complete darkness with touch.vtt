00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
Imagine if your phone could see for you. This could be really useful in low visibility situations,

00:04.640 --> 00:08.640
but more than anything, it should be useful for people who are blind. This should be possible

00:08.640 --> 00:12.960
because smartphones and tablets have some pretty incredible sensors in them. They know where they

00:12.960 --> 00:17.440
are in space and what's around them. If you could somehow communicate what the phone is seeing

00:17.440 --> 00:21.040
with an interface that doesn't require a screen, something you can touch or hear,

00:21.040 --> 00:24.880
it could actually be a pretty good replacement set of eyes. I've been thinking if I could do that,

00:24.880 --> 00:28.560
it might actually be useful invention in contrast to a lot of the stuff I make.

00:28.640 --> 00:32.960
It took me a few tries, but I did eventually get a system working. This iPad is running an app

00:32.960 --> 00:38.160
that I wrote, which is talking to a kind of unusual case for it. And what it does is it's

00:38.160 --> 00:43.120
communicating what it sees into my hand through a tactile interface right here. This allows me to

00:43.120 --> 00:46.800
walk around blindfolded and not hit things. I think if I refined it a little bit more,

00:46.800 --> 00:50.640
it could be a Braille display. It doesn't have enough resolution to do that right now, but

00:50.640 --> 00:55.440
there's no reason it couldn't, I don't think. So inside of this, there's a pretty cool mechanism,

00:55.440 --> 00:59.680
which I'll show you. I also spent way too much engineering time trying to prank my wife. She's

00:59.680 --> 01:04.800
kind of on red alert now, so I had to come up with a complicated scheme to get her right where I

01:04.800 --> 01:08.800
wanted her. So as usual, this project was a lot harder than I was thinking that it was going to

01:08.800 --> 01:12.000
be. Yeah, because you did it the hard way. If you just would have used a bunch of motors,

01:12.000 --> 01:15.680
like I said, it would have been a whole lot easier that way. No, what we should have done

01:15.680 --> 01:19.200
is made an entirely new actuator from scratch. I'm telling you, night and all is the future.

01:19.200 --> 01:23.440
All right, all right. So I did have a lot of internal debate on the best way to build this thing.

01:23.440 --> 01:28.480
There's actually several different, all good ways to build this. I went with this approach

01:28.480 --> 01:32.400
because I thought it was the most interesting. There's a really cool mechanism inside of here.

01:33.040 --> 01:37.040
I also want to thank San Juan Steve for nerd sniping me with this idea and the comments

01:37.040 --> 01:42.160
from my last video. Also, thank you for having a name that is WorkSafe San Juan Steve. This totally

01:42.160 --> 01:46.800
distracted me from the project I was working on, which is making myself better at playing this violin

01:46.800 --> 01:51.440
with the help of some robotics. It may still be on hold because I have a couple of other really

01:51.440 --> 01:56.400
interesting projects that are competing for my attention. So I've been thinking a lot about

01:56.400 --> 02:02.400
guided missiles and if there might be any kind of constructive uses for them. And I finally think

02:02.400 --> 02:08.960
I have it. So imagine building the Iron Man gauntlet that flies like a rocket onto Tony Stark's hand.

02:08.960 --> 02:14.320
I've been thinking about this problem. Definitely is dangerous, but I think it might be borderline

02:14.320 --> 02:19.040
possible. That would be really cool. I'm also really interested in the idea of a baseball bat

02:19.040 --> 02:24.560
that doubles or triples the power of my swing with the assistance of a very modest explosive

02:24.560 --> 02:29.360
charge. I think I have a legal and interesting way to do that as well. If any of those things sound

02:29.360 --> 02:35.040
cool, you should subscribe. I give you my word that I will build some all or none of those things.

02:35.040 --> 02:39.600
I promise. Oh yeah. And I did finally set up a Patreon. If you want to help support me making

02:39.600 --> 02:44.640
more awesome things and videos, this is a great way to do that. These videos do typically take

02:44.640 --> 02:49.360
more than a hundred hours each and also quite a bit of money and material and tooling and other

02:49.360 --> 02:53.760
things. In exchange, I'll be giving more behind the scenes info and in-depth project stuff. So

02:53.760 --> 02:57.280
if that's interesting, there's a link in the description. All right, back to the project.

02:57.280 --> 03:02.880
I calculate that this thing gives me roughly 20-1200 vision. Not the best, but it's better than

03:02.880 --> 03:08.320
nothing. What 20-1200 vision means is that if I look at something with this, that's 20 feet away,

03:08.320 --> 03:13.280
it will look as clear as it would look to someone if I took that thing and moved it 1200 feet away.

03:13.280 --> 03:16.720
Going into this project, I really wasn't sure how I was going to do the sensing.

03:16.720 --> 03:21.600
I was looking at using sonar sensors and off-the-shelf lidar unit. I was strongly

03:21.600 --> 03:25.840
considering using the Kinect, but seriously, where are you going to put this thing? Are you

03:25.840 --> 03:30.560
going to ask someone to just wear this on their head? You look like a complete idiot. Think about

03:30.560 --> 03:34.400
how people would treat you if you walked down the street with this on your head. The goal of this

03:34.400 --> 03:40.480
project is maybe something that could help humanity not hurt it. And I then remembered that the new

03:40.480 --> 03:44.880
iPad has a lidar in it, which is awesome. The only problem is that it's only the latest iPad that

03:44.880 --> 03:49.120
has the lidar in it, and I don't have one. And if you really think about it, I don't have a choice

03:49.120 --> 03:56.240
here. I have to get this. It's to help humanity. Really? Humanity? It's going to help blind people.

03:56.240 --> 03:58.960
Let's think about it. Fine.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.440
Lidar is one of those things that if it didn't exist and you proposed it to me as an engineer,

04:05.440 --> 04:09.520
I would laugh you out of the room. It just does not seem like it should exist. It's kind of like

04:09.520 --> 04:14.800
ball screws where if you look at how they work, it still seems like magic. Lidar is crazy because

04:14.800 --> 04:19.680
it measures the time that it takes light to travel from the iPad to an object, reflect off it, and

04:19.680 --> 04:25.680
then come back. And this is crazy because light is mind-bogglingly fast. It's going around 670

04:25.680 --> 04:30.480
million miles per hour. Unless it's light in the EU or Canada, in which case it's going about a

04:30.480 --> 04:35.520
billion kilometers per hour. So the time that it takes to go from the iPad to a wall is on the

04:35.520 --> 04:40.160
order of 5 nanoseconds. And to actually measure distance, you have to measure much more precisely

04:40.160 --> 04:44.480
than this. The Lidar is actually sending out beams of light in all directions. It gives you a bunch

04:44.480 --> 04:48.400
of measurements on the surface of everything that it sees and how far away it is from the iPad.

04:48.960 --> 04:53.680
So this is an incredibly powerful technique for perceiving the world. It's how most self-driving

04:53.680 --> 04:57.680
cars actually figure out what's around them. The other big architectural question I had to figure

04:57.680 --> 05:02.160
out is how do I communicate what the thing is seeing using touch? The proposal in the comments

05:02.160 --> 05:07.840
was to use some kind of vest, but my limited experience with nerves and humans is that

05:07.840 --> 05:12.560
your torso isn't actually very good at sensing. So we're going to do a two-point discrimination

05:12.560 --> 05:20.400
test. Tell me if you feel one or two touches. One. It's just so funny. I'm like jabbing you with two

05:20.400 --> 05:25.600
screwdrivers. I know it's just how your body works, but it's really kind of funny. All right,

05:25.600 --> 05:30.080
now turn around so I can test the front. That's probably not such a good idea, is it?

05:30.800 --> 05:35.680
Your back isn't so great for tactile input, but your hands are incredible.

05:35.680 --> 05:39.040
Not only do they have good resolutions, they can distinguish lots of touches.

05:39.040 --> 05:42.640
They also are extremely sensitive. If this device could be a phone case,

05:42.640 --> 05:46.480
I think that's legitimately more useful. A vest, you have to wear it and have all

05:46.480 --> 05:50.960
these sensors, whereas your phone, you just have your phone and it helps you see.

05:51.600 --> 05:54.800
So let's imagine that the iPad is seeing this. It's a room with a door and a chair.

05:54.800 --> 05:59.280
What I do is I convert this into the simplest representation possible for navigating the space.

05:59.280 --> 06:03.120
Right here, there's something that you don't want to hit. That's very close. That's the chair.

06:03.120 --> 06:07.360
I have some stuff that's further. That's the walls. And then everywhere else is clear.

06:07.360 --> 06:11.840
I can actually communicate this into your hand because there's not so much information.

06:11.840 --> 06:16.560
If something is really close, I push really hard on your fingers at those corresponding

06:16.560 --> 06:22.080
locations. If something is there but not as close, I can push not as hard. Where it's clear,

06:22.080 --> 06:25.760
I don't push at all. This gives me basically a course map of what's going on in the world

06:25.760 --> 06:30.240
on my hand. So I also made a couple different views. So if you want to zoom in and get more

06:30.240 --> 06:36.560
detail, I have the ability to zoom. I also have an experimental top-down view. So this is the chair,

06:36.560 --> 06:41.200
this is the wall, looking down from above. I can say that this is no go. This is open.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.760
And these areas are unknown because I can't see through the walls with the lidar.

06:45.760 --> 06:51.040
Remember, I'm looking from this perspective so I can only see what I can see through the doorway.

06:51.040 --> 06:54.720
I can communicate this to the hand the same way I do the other view. It's just a different view

06:54.720 --> 06:58.720
of the room. This view is kind of like the little mini-map in a first-person shooter in the bottom

06:58.720 --> 07:02.000
of the screen, if you know what I'm talking about. I think this could be a pretty nice view with more

07:02.000 --> 07:07.360
improvement. But this problem of things blocking other things happens a lot in practice. And so

07:07.360 --> 07:11.360
it can be really difficult to interpret what you're looking at. To make this work, I had to find a way

07:11.360 --> 07:16.960
to poke all of my fingers simultaneously with a controllable amount of poke. And that's hard

07:16.960 --> 07:23.520
because I would like this to be an iPhone case. And that means I really, this is about as big as I

07:23.520 --> 07:27.920
can go, kind of a grip shape. So if I just try to do the simple thing and cram a bunch of servo

07:27.920 --> 07:32.400
motors in here, attach to each pin, there's just no way that's going to fit. Especially if I try to

07:32.400 --> 07:36.800
scale it up so that it can be a Braille display, which I think is important and very useful. So

07:36.800 --> 07:40.640
the big challenge for this project was finding a way to move all those pins with a compact and

07:40.640 --> 07:44.880
ideally simple system. So what I wanted to do is make something that had a little metal pin that

07:44.880 --> 07:50.000
I could push into every joint of every finger. And the way that I did this, imagine that I have one

07:50.000 --> 07:54.640
of the pins that I want to move pressed against a cylinder that I can rotate. If I attach a little

07:54.640 --> 08:00.480
wedge to this cylinder, when it goes underneath this pin, it's going to force it up. Then if I make

08:00.480 --> 08:05.600
an even bigger wedge and I move my cylinder over, I can spin the cylinder and then push this pin

08:05.600 --> 08:10.480
up even higher. All that I have to be able to do is can is rotate the cylinder and shift it left

08:10.480 --> 08:15.520
and right to control how high up this pin goes. And then because it's a cylinder, I can pack

08:16.080 --> 08:20.800
lots of ramps and lots of pins into it very compactly. Here's what some well-used ramps look

08:20.800 --> 08:26.720
like IRL. That big bump next to them is used to trigger the pin locking and unlocking mechanism.

08:26.720 --> 08:31.280
It's basically another ramp. And this keeps the pins in place when they're not under a ramp. And

08:31.280 --> 08:35.760
then you can see that I can control where the cylinder goes with two opposing motors. By driving

08:35.760 --> 08:40.640
them together, it rotates. And by driving only one of them, I can move it left and right. Planning

08:40.640 --> 08:44.960
the motor moves for this system is a lot harder than I expected. Mostly because I wanted to move

08:44.960 --> 08:50.960
one motor at a continuous speed and then have the other one keeping pace. It was a lot of quadratic

08:50.960 --> 09:00.880
equations. And now the pain and joy of making this in 60 seconds or less.

09:00.880 --> 09:16.800
Ah, why?

09:30.880 --> 09:46.800
Ah.

09:50.960 --> 09:54.560
This is the electronics. And the only thing that really mattered for proving the system is that

09:54.560 --> 09:59.840
they work. So I made zero attempts at miniaturizing them. And they're very simple. They're just a

09:59.840 --> 10:04.800
microcontroller Bluetooth communication module and then two big fat stepper motor drivers. If I

10:04.800 --> 10:08.480
was trying to make this a real product, I'd be trying to fit it onto a little circuit board, which

10:08.480 --> 10:13.600
there's no reason it couldn't. This is just what I had on hand. I should also point out that these

10:13.600 --> 10:18.400
motors are massively overkill for the application. It doesn't take much power to raise a little pin.

10:18.400 --> 10:22.160
I went with these partially because they're what I had on hand and also because

10:22.160 --> 10:25.440
it's convenient to have a lot of extra power when you're prototyping. Now we don't worry about

10:25.440 --> 10:29.840
stalling and other stuff. It's been almost a decade since I last wrote an iPad app.

10:29.840 --> 10:34.880
And it's gotten a lot easier. And this is the app. It's really quite simple. I have all the

10:34.880 --> 10:39.440
controls on the side for the different views and for zooming. And these are all accessible when

10:39.440 --> 10:43.760
you're holding the grip on the side. There's a little preview of the depth data. And this just

10:43.760 --> 10:48.480
helps me see what's going on. Ideally this would be running on a phone, but the LiDAR is only in

10:48.480 --> 10:52.640
the iPad. If Apple puts the LiDAR on the iPhone, you could imagine it could just be a phone with

10:52.640 --> 10:56.880
a little case on it, which would be really cool. That's pretty much all there is to this app.

10:56.880 --> 11:01.600
Apple makes it really easy to work with LiDAR data. I spent a lot more time on the embedded system

11:01.600 --> 11:06.320
trying to get the motor profiles working. And it was kind of wasted time, but I spent probably more

11:06.320 --> 11:11.200
time trying to get wife mode working than anything else in this app. I really wanted to see my wife

11:11.200 --> 11:16.240
walk into something. So I set it up to initially tell her correct data. Then after a bit start giving

11:16.240 --> 11:24.160
her bad data. Probably just a bug. It's a complicated system. This thing is really weird to use.

11:24.160 --> 11:28.240
It's a lot less intuitive than I was thinking it would be. You can feel all the pokes, but

11:28.240 --> 11:33.280
I think about every finger and what it's feeling to try to create a mental image of what's in front

11:33.280 --> 11:38.400
of me. Although I do think that if you used it a lot, it might become second nature. I remember

11:38.400 --> 11:43.040
learning the type was pretty similar to this. It also lets you see things like overhead obstructions.

11:43.040 --> 11:46.960
So you can get under them. Although it's since it's only giving two levels of depth, it was hard

11:46.960 --> 11:51.760
for me to figure out where the obstruction actually was. So and you can see me pointing the iPad up

11:51.760 --> 11:57.120
to see if there's anything above me. I would really like to see more touch points and more control

11:57.120 --> 12:00.960
of those touch points because you really can feel the difference between these different pin

12:00.960 --> 12:04.960
pressures. I think you could get a much nicer picture of what's around you if they could push

12:04.960 --> 12:09.360
with more granularity. If I was doing another revision or trying to make this as a product,

12:09.360 --> 12:14.320
I would be trying to find some little tiny actuator that I could buy that would allow me to

12:14.320 --> 12:18.880
directly control every pin. I think it's a cool proof of concept and hopefully you'll like it as

12:18.880 --> 12:23.280
well. So a lot of people have pointed out that I have a lot of tools and that I may in fact even

12:23.280 --> 12:27.520
have a problem, which is probably true, but I would have an even bigger problem if all my tools got

12:27.520 --> 12:32.240
stolen. Though I do spend a lot less time worrying thanks to this video sponsor Simply Safe. I spent

12:32.240 --> 12:36.400
most of my adult life and my adult dollars building out this shop and the idea of someone

12:36.400 --> 12:41.040
busting in and stealing my tools makes me want to curl up and die. Although let's be real, if

12:41.040 --> 12:45.200
someone manages to steal this, they can have it. I'm only joking. That is not a challenge. Please

12:45.200 --> 12:49.680
don't rob me. Although if you do try to rob me, you're busted because Simply Safe detects basically

12:49.680 --> 12:53.840
every possible intrusion and calls the police immediately. You're going to kick down my door.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.880
You just triggered my entry sensor. You're going to break my window. You just triggered my glass

12:56.880 --> 13:00.720
brake sensor. You're going to cut a hole through my wall. Say hello to my motion sensor. Then wave

13:00.720 --> 13:04.160
to me and the police dispatch on my HD security camera. You're going to try to break in when the

13:04.160 --> 13:08.400
system is disarmed. Boom. Got a panic button. Simply Safe protects against outsiders, but it also

13:08.400 --> 13:12.720
protects against me. And honestly, with all the stuff I get up to, I'm probably the biggest danger

13:12.720 --> 13:16.080
here. I've got a fire alarm. If I accidentally leave a smoldering heap in the basement that

13:16.080 --> 13:20.480
catches fire once I'm gone, I'm going to get notified. Got a carbon monoxide sensor. If I

13:20.480 --> 13:24.240
leave my jet engine running and it makes a bunch of carbon monoxide, it's going to let me know

13:24.240 --> 13:28.320
before it kills me. The number one thing for me though is the automatic deadbolt. The number of

13:28.320 --> 13:32.960
times I've come back to see if the shop is actually locked is way too high. You get notified if you

13:32.960 --> 13:37.280
forget to lock the door. You can lock it remotely. You can check it. Super handy. So if I was going

13:37.280 --> 13:40.720
to rob your house, the first thing I'd do is I'd cut your power and your telephone. Although if

13:40.720 --> 13:45.440
you had Simply Safe, I'd be a fool because it has a battery backup and uses cell service. It's super

13:45.440 --> 13:49.120
reliable. It's usually ordered online or over the phone and they ship it straight to your house.

13:49.120 --> 13:52.960
You stick the sensors wherever you want them and hit a few buttons and that's about it. It doesn't

13:52.960 --> 13:57.280
even take an hour. And it's only 50 cents a day with no contract. That's cheaper than my previous

13:57.280 --> 14:01.680
security system which had a contract. So have a lot more peace of mind with Simply Safe, knowing

14:01.680 --> 14:05.840
that you're protected around the clock from basically anything you can think of. Visit
