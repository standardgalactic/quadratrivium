1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Imagine if your phone could see for you. This could be really useful in low visibility situations,

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,640
but more than anything, it should be useful for people who are blind. This should be possible

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,960
because smartphones and tablets have some pretty incredible sensors in them. They know where they

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,440
are in space and what's around them. If you could somehow communicate what the phone is seeing

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,040
with an interface that doesn't require a screen, something you can touch or hear,

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,880
it could actually be a pretty good replacement set of eyes. I've been thinking if I could do that,

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,560
it might actually be useful invention in contrast to a lot of the stuff I make.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,960
It took me a few tries, but I did eventually get a system working. This iPad is running an app

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,160
that I wrote, which is talking to a kind of unusual case for it. And what it does is it's

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,120
communicating what it sees into my hand through a tactile interface right here. This allows me to

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,800
walk around blindfolded and not hit things. I think if I refined it a little bit more,

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,640
it could be a Braille display. It doesn't have enough resolution to do that right now, but

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,440
there's no reason it couldn't, I don't think. So inside of this, there's a pretty cool mechanism,

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,680
which I'll show you. I also spent way too much engineering time trying to prank my wife. She's

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,800
kind of on red alert now, so I had to come up with a complicated scheme to get her right where I

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,800
wanted her. So as usual, this project was a lot harder than I was thinking that it was going to

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,000
be. Yeah, because you did it the hard way. If you just would have used a bunch of motors,

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,680
like I said, it would have been a whole lot easier that way. No, what we should have done

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,200
is made an entirely new actuator from scratch. I'm telling you, night and all is the future.

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,440
All right, all right. So I did have a lot of internal debate on the best way to build this thing.

21
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,480
There's actually several different, all good ways to build this. I went with this approach

22
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,400
because I thought it was the most interesting. There's a really cool mechanism inside of here.

23
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,040
I also want to thank San Juan Steve for nerd sniping me with this idea and the comments

24
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,160
from my last video. Also, thank you for having a name that is WorkSafe San Juan Steve. This totally

25
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,800
distracted me from the project I was working on, which is making myself better at playing this violin

26
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,440
with the help of some robotics. It may still be on hold because I have a couple of other really

27
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,400
interesting projects that are competing for my attention. So I've been thinking a lot about

28
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,400
guided missiles and if there might be any kind of constructive uses for them. And I finally think

29
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,960
I have it. So imagine building the Iron Man gauntlet that flies like a rocket onto Tony Stark's hand.

30
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,320
I've been thinking about this problem. Definitely is dangerous, but I think it might be borderline

31
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,040
possible. That would be really cool. I'm also really interested in the idea of a baseball bat

32
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,560
that doubles or triples the power of my swing with the assistance of a very modest explosive

33
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,360
charge. I think I have a legal and interesting way to do that as well. If any of those things sound

34
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,040
cool, you should subscribe. I give you my word that I will build some all or none of those things.

35
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,600
I promise. Oh yeah. And I did finally set up a Patreon. If you want to help support me making

36
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,640
more awesome things and videos, this is a great way to do that. These videos do typically take

37
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,360
more than a hundred hours each and also quite a bit of money and material and tooling and other

38
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,760
things. In exchange, I'll be giving more behind the scenes info and in-depth project stuff. So

39
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,280
if that's interesting, there's a link in the description. All right, back to the project.

40
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,880
I calculate that this thing gives me roughly 20-1200 vision. Not the best, but it's better than

41
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,320
nothing. What 20-1200 vision means is that if I look at something with this, that's 20 feet away,

42
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,280
it will look as clear as it would look to someone if I took that thing and moved it 1200 feet away.

43
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,720
Going into this project, I really wasn't sure how I was going to do the sensing.

44
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,600
I was looking at using sonar sensors and off-the-shelf lidar unit. I was strongly

45
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,840
considering using the Kinect, but seriously, where are you going to put this thing? Are you

46
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,560
going to ask someone to just wear this on their head? You look like a complete idiot. Think about

47
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,400
how people would treat you if you walked down the street with this on your head. The goal of this

48
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,480
project is maybe something that could help humanity not hurt it. And I then remembered that the new

49
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,880
iPad has a lidar in it, which is awesome. The only problem is that it's only the latest iPad that

50
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,120
has the lidar in it, and I don't have one. And if you really think about it, I don't have a choice

51
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,240
here. I have to get this. It's to help humanity. Really? Humanity? It's going to help blind people.

52
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,960
Let's think about it. Fine.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,440
Lidar is one of those things that if it didn't exist and you proposed it to me as an engineer,

54
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,520
I would laugh you out of the room. It just does not seem like it should exist. It's kind of like

55
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,800
ball screws where if you look at how they work, it still seems like magic. Lidar is crazy because

56
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,680
it measures the time that it takes light to travel from the iPad to an object, reflect off it, and

57
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,680
then come back. And this is crazy because light is mind-bogglingly fast. It's going around 670

58
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,480
million miles per hour. Unless it's light in the EU or Canada, in which case it's going about a

59
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,520
billion kilometers per hour. So the time that it takes to go from the iPad to a wall is on the

60
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,160
order of 5 nanoseconds. And to actually measure distance, you have to measure much more precisely

61
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,480
than this. The Lidar is actually sending out beams of light in all directions. It gives you a bunch

62
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,400
of measurements on the surface of everything that it sees and how far away it is from the iPad.

63
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,680
So this is an incredibly powerful technique for perceiving the world. It's how most self-driving

64
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,680
cars actually figure out what's around them. The other big architectural question I had to figure

65
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,160
out is how do I communicate what the thing is seeing using touch? The proposal in the comments

66
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,840
was to use some kind of vest, but my limited experience with nerves and humans is that

67
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,560
your torso isn't actually very good at sensing. So we're going to do a two-point discrimination

68
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:20,400
test. Tell me if you feel one or two touches. One. It's just so funny. I'm like jabbing you with two

69
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,600
screwdrivers. I know it's just how your body works, but it's really kind of funny. All right,

70
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,080
now turn around so I can test the front. That's probably not such a good idea, is it?

71
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,680
Your back isn't so great for tactile input, but your hands are incredible.

72
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,040
Not only do they have good resolutions, they can distinguish lots of touches.

73
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,640
They also are extremely sensitive. If this device could be a phone case,

74
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,480
I think that's legitimately more useful. A vest, you have to wear it and have all

75
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,960
these sensors, whereas your phone, you just have your phone and it helps you see.

76
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,800
So let's imagine that the iPad is seeing this. It's a room with a door and a chair.

77
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,280
What I do is I convert this into the simplest representation possible for navigating the space.

78
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,120
Right here, there's something that you don't want to hit. That's very close. That's the chair.

79
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,360
I have some stuff that's further. That's the walls. And then everywhere else is clear.

80
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,840
I can actually communicate this into your hand because there's not so much information.

81
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,560
If something is really close, I push really hard on your fingers at those corresponding

82
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,080
locations. If something is there but not as close, I can push not as hard. Where it's clear,

83
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,760
I don't push at all. This gives me basically a course map of what's going on in the world

84
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,240
on my hand. So I also made a couple different views. So if you want to zoom in and get more

85
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,560
detail, I have the ability to zoom. I also have an experimental top-down view. So this is the chair,

86
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,200
this is the wall, looking down from above. I can say that this is no go. This is open.

87
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,760
And these areas are unknown because I can't see through the walls with the lidar.

88
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:51,040
Remember, I'm looking from this perspective so I can only see what I can see through the doorway.

89
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,720
I can communicate this to the hand the same way I do the other view. It's just a different view

90
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,720
of the room. This view is kind of like the little mini-map in a first-person shooter in the bottom

91
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,000
of the screen, if you know what I'm talking about. I think this could be a pretty nice view with more

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,360
improvement. But this problem of things blocking other things happens a lot in practice. And so

93
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,360
it can be really difficult to interpret what you're looking at. To make this work, I had to find a way

94
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,960
to poke all of my fingers simultaneously with a controllable amount of poke. And that's hard

95
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:23,520
because I would like this to be an iPhone case. And that means I really, this is about as big as I

96
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,920
can go, kind of a grip shape. So if I just try to do the simple thing and cram a bunch of servo

97
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,400
motors in here, attach to each pin, there's just no way that's going to fit. Especially if I try to

98
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,800
scale it up so that it can be a Braille display, which I think is important and very useful. So

99
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,640
the big challenge for this project was finding a way to move all those pins with a compact and

100
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,880
ideally simple system. So what I wanted to do is make something that had a little metal pin that

101
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,000
I could push into every joint of every finger. And the way that I did this, imagine that I have one

102
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,640
of the pins that I want to move pressed against a cylinder that I can rotate. If I attach a little

103
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:00,480
wedge to this cylinder, when it goes underneath this pin, it's going to force it up. Then if I make

104
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,600
an even bigger wedge and I move my cylinder over, I can spin the cylinder and then push this pin

105
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,480
up even higher. All that I have to be able to do is can is rotate the cylinder and shift it left

106
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,520
and right to control how high up this pin goes. And then because it's a cylinder, I can pack

107
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,800
lots of ramps and lots of pins into it very compactly. Here's what some well-used ramps look

108
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,720
like IRL. That big bump next to them is used to trigger the pin locking and unlocking mechanism.

109
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,280
It's basically another ramp. And this keeps the pins in place when they're not under a ramp. And

110
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,760
then you can see that I can control where the cylinder goes with two opposing motors. By driving

111
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,640
them together, it rotates. And by driving only one of them, I can move it left and right. Planning

112
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,960
the motor moves for this system is a lot harder than I expected. Mostly because I wanted to move

113
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:50,960
one motor at a continuous speed and then have the other one keeping pace. It was a lot of quadratic

114
00:08:50,960 --> 00:09:00,880
equations. And now the pain and joy of making this in 60 seconds or less.

115
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:16,800
Ah, why?

116
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:46,800
Ah.

117
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,560
This is the electronics. And the only thing that really mattered for proving the system is that

118
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,840
they work. So I made zero attempts at miniaturizing them. And they're very simple. They're just a

119
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,800
microcontroller Bluetooth communication module and then two big fat stepper motor drivers. If I

120
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,480
was trying to make this a real product, I'd be trying to fit it onto a little circuit board, which

121
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,600
there's no reason it couldn't. This is just what I had on hand. I should also point out that these

122
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,400
motors are massively overkill for the application. It doesn't take much power to raise a little pin.

123
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,160
I went with these partially because they're what I had on hand and also because

124
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,440
it's convenient to have a lot of extra power when you're prototyping. Now we don't worry about

125
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,840
stalling and other stuff. It's been almost a decade since I last wrote an iPad app.

126
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,880
And it's gotten a lot easier. And this is the app. It's really quite simple. I have all the

127
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,440
controls on the side for the different views and for zooming. And these are all accessible when

128
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,760
you're holding the grip on the side. There's a little preview of the depth data. And this just

129
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,480
helps me see what's going on. Ideally this would be running on a phone, but the LiDAR is only in

130
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,640
the iPad. If Apple puts the LiDAR on the iPhone, you could imagine it could just be a phone with

131
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,880
a little case on it, which would be really cool. That's pretty much all there is to this app.

132
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,600
Apple makes it really easy to work with LiDAR data. I spent a lot more time on the embedded system

133
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,320
trying to get the motor profiles working. And it was kind of wasted time, but I spent probably more

134
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,200
time trying to get wife mode working than anything else in this app. I really wanted to see my wife

135
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,240
walk into something. So I set it up to initially tell her correct data. Then after a bit start giving

136
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:24,160
her bad data. Probably just a bug. It's a complicated system. This thing is really weird to use.

137
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,240
It's a lot less intuitive than I was thinking it would be. You can feel all the pokes, but

138
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,280
I think about every finger and what it's feeling to try to create a mental image of what's in front

139
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,400
of me. Although I do think that if you used it a lot, it might become second nature. I remember

140
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,040
learning the type was pretty similar to this. It also lets you see things like overhead obstructions.

141
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,960
So you can get under them. Although it's since it's only giving two levels of depth, it was hard

142
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,760
for me to figure out where the obstruction actually was. So and you can see me pointing the iPad up

143
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,120
to see if there's anything above me. I would really like to see more touch points and more control

144
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,960
of those touch points because you really can feel the difference between these different pin

145
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,960
pressures. I think you could get a much nicer picture of what's around you if they could push

146
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,360
with more granularity. If I was doing another revision or trying to make this as a product,

147
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,320
I would be trying to find some little tiny actuator that I could buy that would allow me to

148
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,880
directly control every pin. I think it's a cool proof of concept and hopefully you'll like it as

149
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,280
well. So a lot of people have pointed out that I have a lot of tools and that I may in fact even

150
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,520
have a problem, which is probably true, but I would have an even bigger problem if all my tools got

151
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,240
stolen. Though I do spend a lot less time worrying thanks to this video sponsor Simply Safe. I spent

152
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,400
most of my adult life and my adult dollars building out this shop and the idea of someone

153
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,040
busting in and stealing my tools makes me want to curl up and die. Although let's be real, if

154
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,200
someone manages to steal this, they can have it. I'm only joking. That is not a challenge. Please

155
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,680
don't rob me. Although if you do try to rob me, you're busted because Simply Safe detects basically

156
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,840
every possible intrusion and calls the police immediately. You're going to kick down my door.

157
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,880
You just triggered my entry sensor. You're going to break my window. You just triggered my glass

158
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,720
brake sensor. You're going to cut a hole through my wall. Say hello to my motion sensor. Then wave

159
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,160
to me and the police dispatch on my HD security camera. You're going to try to break in when the

160
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,400
system is disarmed. Boom. Got a panic button. Simply Safe protects against outsiders, but it also

161
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,720
protects against me. And honestly, with all the stuff I get up to, I'm probably the biggest danger

162
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,080
here. I've got a fire alarm. If I accidentally leave a smoldering heap in the basement that

163
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,480
catches fire once I'm gone, I'm going to get notified. Got a carbon monoxide sensor. If I

164
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,240
leave my jet engine running and it makes a bunch of carbon monoxide, it's going to let me know

165
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,320
before it kills me. The number one thing for me though is the automatic deadbolt. The number of

166
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,960
times I've come back to see if the shop is actually locked is way too high. You get notified if you

167
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,280
forget to lock the door. You can lock it remotely. You can check it. Super handy. So if I was going

168
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,720
to rob your house, the first thing I'd do is I'd cut your power and your telephone. Although if

169
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,440
you had Simply Safe, I'd be a fool because it has a battery backup and uses cell service. It's super

170
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,120
reliable. It's usually ordered online or over the phone and they ship it straight to your house.

171
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,960
You stick the sensors wherever you want them and hit a few buttons and that's about it. It doesn't

172
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,280
even take an hour. And it's only 50 cents a day with no contract. That's cheaper than my previous

173
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,680
security system which had a contract. So have a lot more peace of mind with Simply Safe, knowing

174
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,840
that you're protected around the clock from basically anything you can think of. Visit
