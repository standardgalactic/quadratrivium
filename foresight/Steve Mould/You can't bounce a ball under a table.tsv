0	4480	It's weirdly difficult to pass a bouncy ball under a table.
4480	9200	The ball always wants to bounce out the same way it came in, which is odd.
9200	13120	This is something that my friend Hugh Hunt showed me ages ago,
13120	15680	and if you watch my channel a lot, you might be thinking,
15680	20560	hey, that's really similar to the golf ball paradox from a few videos ago.
20560	26160	If so, you're a lot smarter than I am, because I made the whole golf ball paradox video without
26160	29280	once thinking about balls bouncing under a table.
29280	31760	But then someone sent me this video.
31760	37440	Here, the ball bounces around inside a square container and comes back out the way it came in
37440	39440	without touching the back wall.
39440	43760	AT, who sent me the video, felt that it was linked to the golf ball paradox.
43760	49680	Only then did I think, well, hold on, if you can reduce the golf ball paradox down to a ball
49680	54640	bouncing around the inside of a four-sided shape, why not go further?
54640	60160	Why not reduce the problem to a ball bouncing between just two surfaces like Hugh showed me
60160	61840	all those years ago?
61840	66640	And this is great because, you know, I gave an explanation for the golf ball paradox,
66640	68960	but I wasn't that happy with it.
68960	74960	And I feel like now I have a great opportunity to explain what's going on in a really intuitive way.
74960	76240	So here's the plan.
76240	81920	If I can show that a ball bouncing back to you from under a table makes intuitive sense,
81920	86960	and if I can also show that that continues to make sense as we increase the number of
86960	92320	surfaces that the ball bounces off, well, then we just keep increasing the number of surfaces
92320	95200	until we have essentially a smooth surface.
95200	97680	We have the cylinder from the golf ball paradox.
97680	102960	In other words, we're taking the dynamics of a ball continuously rolling around the inside of a
102960	107200	container and we're discretizing it into lots of little collisions.
107280	111920	So let's first have a look at a ball bouncing under a table and see if we can make sense of that.
111920	116160	So we'll assume the ball isn't spinning at all when it first hits the ground,
116160	120560	but when it does hit the ground, the ground imparts some spin onto the ball,
120560	122320	which makes intuitive sense.
122320	125600	And actually, it's something you're familiar with from everyday life,
125600	129840	like the second bounce of a bouncy ball is often weird and unexpected.
129840	133440	That's just because of the spin that was imparted on the ball from the first bounce.
133920	138800	But to hammer the point home, imagine the interaction from the point of view of the ball
138800	141120	from the ball's reference frame, if you like.
141120	145040	If you have a stationary ball and a wall rushes up to it and swipes it,
145040	146720	the ball will obviously start spinning.
146720	151120	But look what happens now when the spinning ball hits the underside of the table.
151120	155360	Well, when the ball hits the underside of the table, it's got backspin.
155360	160320	And again, you know from experience what happens when a ball has backspin and it hits a surface.
160320	162480	It comes back in the direction of the spin.
162480	165440	And that makes intuitive sense if you think about it in slow motion.
165440	169520	Let's all pretend that I've keyed out my hand in this shot and you can only see the ball.
169520	173200	So you've got a ball approaching a surface with some spin.
173200	174960	The ball has angular momentum.
174960	177520	In other words, it wants to keep spinning.
177520	180160	Yes, I'm anthropomorphizing the ball, but that's okay.
180160	182800	It will want to keep spinning when it touches the surface.
182800	186560	But because of friction, it will have to roll during the collision.
186560	189920	As a result, the ball ends up traveling back the way it came.
190000	194800	In other words, the angular momentum of the ball is turned into a change in linear momentum.
194800	197840	And in fact, the swipe from the underside of the table
197840	200400	results in the ball spinning slowly in the other direction.
201040	204320	The final bounce is pretty boring and what you'd expect,
204320	207520	but it's the bounce that takes the ball back out again.
207520	210960	Now let's double the number of faces the ball has to bounce around.
210960	215760	We're now back to the square container, or as I like to call it, a very low polycylinder.
215760	218480	I'm filming it from the side instead of straight down.
218480	220720	And I've made one of the walls transparent.
220720	224720	I feel like this way it's easier to see what's going on with the spin of the ball.
224720	228880	So when the ball first hits the bottom plate, it gains some spin.
228880	233600	Hopefully it's intuitive to see that the axis of that spin will be in the horizontal plane
233600	236400	and perpendicular to the direction the ball is traveling.
236400	239520	Here I've marked that axis of spin with a couple of pins.
239520	242320	So what happens when the ball hits the second wall?
242320	245440	Well, hopefully you can see that the patch of ball
245440	249040	that touches the wall is moving downwards relative to the wall.
249040	252240	So due to friction, the ball will roll upwards.
252240	254480	In other words, as a result of the spin,
254480	258560	the ball will travel more steeply upwards than it would otherwise.
258560	262720	But we should also expect the spin of the ball to change
262720	265920	as a result of the interaction with that surface.
265920	271600	To figure out what the new spin will be, think about what would happen to the ball
271600	276720	if it didn't have any spin as it came into this second collision.
276720	281040	Well, again, hopefully it's intuitive to see that the spin it would have
281040	284000	after this collision would have an axis like this.
284000	286880	But because it did have spin coming into that collision,
286880	290400	we should expect the new spin to be somewhere between the two.
290400	295200	Somewhere between this axis and the axis it had on the way in.
295200	297280	So maybe it's spinning like this.
297280	299840	And actually that's what we see on the slow motion video.
299840	304560	So what will a ball with this spin traveling in this direction do
304560	306800	when it touches the top surface?
306800	309600	Well, let's imagine that the top surface is transparent as well.
310160	314720	So look, you can see that the patch of ball that touches the top surface
314720	316720	is traveling in this direction.
316720	320480	And again, because it's backspin, because of friction,
320480	325200	that will impart momentum onto the ball in the opposite direction.
325200	330320	And in this case, it's enough to switch from the ball traveling into the container
330320	332960	to the ball traveling out of the container.
332960	335680	And again, the spin of the ball will change.
335680	339760	It's somewhere between this spin and the spin that it had coming in.
339760	342480	And again, that's what we see in the slow motion footage.
342480	346800	You can carry on reasoning in this way until the ball leaves the container.
346800	348720	What if we double the number of faces again?
348720	351120	So it's an eight-sided container.
351120	354800	By the way, if anyone feels like actually building an octagonal container
354800	357280	to test this thing, then please do share the results
357280	360160	in the Science Fair Project channel on my Discord server.
360160	361520	Link to that in the description.
361520	363600	But I'll be using animation for now.
363600	367520	And you'll notice that with more faces, each collision with a face
367520	370320	has less of an effect on the trajectory of the ball.
370320	371520	That's for two reasons.
371520	375680	First, the ball is hitting the next face at a shallower angle.
375680	377600	It's less of a head-on collision.
377600	381600	And secondly, because the ball is already spinning from the first collision,
381600	386000	the movement of the surface of the ball underneath the surface of the container,
386000	388000	well, they almost match.
388000	389520	Almost, but not exactly.
389520	393520	Let's actually have a look at what happens between two successive bounces
393520	396400	when you've got this shallow angle between the faces.
396400	397920	Just like with the square container,
397920	402160	the spin of the ball modifies the final trajectory of the ball
402160	404240	as it leaves the second surface.
404240	405440	Just less so.
405440	407360	And just like with the square container,
407360	414000	the new spin axis of the ball will be somewhere between this axis and the axis coming in.
414000	416080	Those two axes are much closer to each other,
416080	419200	so the change of the spin axis is less as well.
419200	423760	So if you have smaller changes per bounce, but more bounces,
423760	425360	you end up with the same result.
425360	429040	The ball comes out after about one full turn.
429040	430800	I say about one full turn,
430800	434480	because you might remember from the golf ball paradox video
434560	437600	that the square root of seven divided by two
437600	441600	gives you the number of rotations around the container
441600	445360	for every full vertical oscillation within the container.
445360	448480	But of course, for the ball to get out of the container,
448480	451040	that's just half a vertical oscillation.
451040	454640	So the number of rotations before the ball comes out of the container,
454640	458560	we should expect to be the square root of seven divided by two.
458560	459840	Divided by two.
459840	462160	And that's a little less than one.
462160	464320	And crucially, there's always that inflection point
464320	468560	where the ball transitions from traveling into the container
468560	470800	to traveling out of the container.
470800	473840	We saw that with the square shaped container.
473840	475120	It's when the ball hits the top wall
475120	477680	that it transitions from going in to going out.
477680	480960	In the hexagonal container, we'd expect that inflection to happen
480960	482400	about halfway round.
482400	484000	But the same principle applies.
484000	487360	It's the point when the angular momentum of the ball
487360	489360	is pointing in the right direction
489360	492160	to cause the ball to switch directions.
492160	494640	If we double the number of faces to 16,
494640	497360	then it's starting to look a lot like a cylinder.
497360	499200	In other words, the golf ball paradox
499200	501360	is just what happens in the limit
501360	505040	as the number of faces of your container approaches infinity.
505040	507920	In the original video, I said that if you assume
507920	510480	the axis of rotation of the ball is fixed,
510480	512080	as if it were a gyroscope,
512080	515280	then we would expect the ball to oscillate up and down.
515280	517760	But that it would make one vertical oscillation
517760	520320	after just one single turn around the cylinder.
520320	523440	I said that the reason it takes more than one turn
523440	525680	is because the cylinder kind of drags
525680	528720	the axis of spin of the ball around
528720	530800	as opposed to the axis being fixed.
530800	533200	And I feel like that's easier to see
533200	534880	in the discretized version.
534880	539040	Like when the ball bounces off a surface with spin,
539040	541280	it forces the ball to change direction.
541280	544480	But the collision also changes the spin of the ball.
544480	547440	We see that very nicely in the slow-mo footage here.
547440	550000	And of course, as the number of faces of the container
550000	551440	tends towards infinity,
551440	553920	the number of collisions tends towards infinity,
553920	557280	and those discrete changes in the direction
557280	559200	of the spin of the ball
559200	561760	becomes a continuous change
561760	563520	in the direction of the spin of the ball
563520	566320	as it rolls around the inside of the cylinder.
566320	567600	A couple more really interesting things
567600	570400	that came up after I published the golf ball paradox video.
570400	572080	Patrick Default emailed me to say
572080	575760	he created a simulation of the golf ball paradox.
575760	578320	He'd also previously created simulations
578320	580000	of the ball on a turntable.
580000	582320	I'll leave a link to all of those in the description.
582320	585680	It really is nice to see that it works in simulation as well.
585680	586880	One final thought.
586880	589120	Discretizing the problem in this way
589120	591120	is really interesting for two reasons.
591120	592880	First, it's what Newton did
592880	595200	when he was first looking at orbits.
595200	596960	Well, maybe it was hook, actually.
596960	598720	But anyway, because orbital mechanics
598720	600080	have nonlinear equations,
600080	602960	it's hard to extrapolate where a planet will be in the future.
602960	604400	But if you imagine it instead
604400	607920	as gravity imparting discrete impulses
607920	609520	onto massive objects,
609520	611120	you can go step by step
611120	613600	to figure out where a planet will be in the future.
613600	616320	On that basis, Newton was able to prove
616320	618880	Kepler's equal area law.
618880	621440	And interestingly, software that simulates
621440	623440	the motion of charged particles
623440	625120	uses the same method.
625120	626720	There's something really interesting
626720	629040	about the business of spam.
629040	632240	Like, a lot of the spam we get is sent illegally.
632240	634080	But a lot of it is completely legal,
634080	636560	including some of the spam phone calls that we get.
636560	639120	But despite being legal,
639120	641680	they're actually potentially really dangerous
641680	642960	as well as annoying.
642960	646160	And that's because of the way the business works.
646160	649760	Basically, there are hundreds of these intermediary companies
649760	651280	called data brokers
651280	653520	that collect data about you
653520	656480	and then sell that data onto marketing agencies
656480	658400	that then call you, send you emails,
658400	660160	maybe even send you stuff in the post.
660160	661680	Because they know so much about you,
661680	664240	often you don't realize it's a marketing call
664240	665760	until a little way in,
665760	667280	which is quite frustrating.
667280	671280	But the real danger is that these intermediary data brokers
671280	674160	don't always have great database security.
674160	677360	There are loads of incidents of database breaches,
677360	681120	and these databases have your personal information on them.
681120	684080	So if you want to stop these annoying spam messages
684080	688720	and remove yourself from these potentially vulnerable databases,
688720	692080	then I humbly recommend the sponsor of this video, Incogni.
692080	693360	The way Incogni works is,
693360	697840	all these data brokers have a method of contacting them
697840	700480	to request that they remove your data
700480	702240	and stop selling it to people.
702240	704480	They all want to be contacted in different ways.
704480	706640	So it's a total pain in the bum to do it on your own.
706640	709920	But Incogni have done all the hard work in advance
709920	712720	so that you can just sign up to Incogni,
712720	714560	give them permission to act on your behalf,
714560	717360	and they'll just take care of it all in the background.
717360	719920	Incogni doesn't bombard you with notifications.
719920	722320	You can log on to their dashboard and see the progress.
722320	726480	Look, these are all the companies that now no longer have my data.
726480	727600	And since signing up,
727600	730400	I just don't get those weird phone calls anymore,
730400	733680	the ones where they know a bit too much about me.
733680	736240	If it sounds like the sort of thing that you'd like to get done,
736240	737920	then the promo on this one's really good.
