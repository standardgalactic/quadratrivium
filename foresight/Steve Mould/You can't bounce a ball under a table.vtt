00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
It's weirdly difficult to pass a bouncy ball under a table.

00:04.480 --> 00:09.200
The ball always wants to bounce out the same way it came in, which is odd.

00:09.200 --> 00:13.120
This is something that my friend Hugh Hunt showed me ages ago,

00:13.120 --> 00:15.680
and if you watch my channel a lot, you might be thinking,

00:15.680 --> 00:20.560
hey, that's really similar to the golf ball paradox from a few videos ago.

00:20.560 --> 00:26.160
If so, you're a lot smarter than I am, because I made the whole golf ball paradox video without

00:26.160 --> 00:29.280
once thinking about balls bouncing under a table.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.760
But then someone sent me this video.

00:31.760 --> 00:37.440
Here, the ball bounces around inside a square container and comes back out the way it came in

00:37.440 --> 00:39.440
without touching the back wall.

00:39.440 --> 00:43.760
AT, who sent me the video, felt that it was linked to the golf ball paradox.

00:43.760 --> 00:49.680
Only then did I think, well, hold on, if you can reduce the golf ball paradox down to a ball

00:49.680 --> 00:54.640
bouncing around the inside of a four-sided shape, why not go further?

00:54.640 --> 01:00.160
Why not reduce the problem to a ball bouncing between just two surfaces like Hugh showed me

01:00.160 --> 01:01.840
all those years ago?

01:01.840 --> 01:06.640
And this is great because, you know, I gave an explanation for the golf ball paradox,

01:06.640 --> 01:08.960
but I wasn't that happy with it.

01:08.960 --> 01:14.960
And I feel like now I have a great opportunity to explain what's going on in a really intuitive way.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.240
So here's the plan.

01:16.240 --> 01:21.920
If I can show that a ball bouncing back to you from under a table makes intuitive sense,

01:21.920 --> 01:26.960
and if I can also show that that continues to make sense as we increase the number of

01:26.960 --> 01:32.320
surfaces that the ball bounces off, well, then we just keep increasing the number of surfaces

01:32.320 --> 01:35.200
until we have essentially a smooth surface.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.680
We have the cylinder from the golf ball paradox.

01:37.680 --> 01:42.960
In other words, we're taking the dynamics of a ball continuously rolling around the inside of a

01:42.960 --> 01:47.200
container and we're discretizing it into lots of little collisions.

01:47.280 --> 01:51.920
So let's first have a look at a ball bouncing under a table and see if we can make sense of that.

01:51.920 --> 01:56.160
So we'll assume the ball isn't spinning at all when it first hits the ground,

01:56.160 --> 02:00.560
but when it does hit the ground, the ground imparts some spin onto the ball,

02:00.560 --> 02:02.320
which makes intuitive sense.

02:02.320 --> 02:05.600
And actually, it's something you're familiar with from everyday life,

02:05.600 --> 02:09.840
like the second bounce of a bouncy ball is often weird and unexpected.

02:09.840 --> 02:13.440
That's just because of the spin that was imparted on the ball from the first bounce.

02:13.920 --> 02:18.800
But to hammer the point home, imagine the interaction from the point of view of the ball

02:18.800 --> 02:21.120
from the ball's reference frame, if you like.

02:21.120 --> 02:25.040
If you have a stationary ball and a wall rushes up to it and swipes it,

02:25.040 --> 02:26.720
the ball will obviously start spinning.

02:26.720 --> 02:31.120
But look what happens now when the spinning ball hits the underside of the table.

02:31.120 --> 02:35.360
Well, when the ball hits the underside of the table, it's got backspin.

02:35.360 --> 02:40.320
And again, you know from experience what happens when a ball has backspin and it hits a surface.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.480
It comes back in the direction of the spin.

02:42.480 --> 02:45.440
And that makes intuitive sense if you think about it in slow motion.

02:45.440 --> 02:49.520
Let's all pretend that I've keyed out my hand in this shot and you can only see the ball.

02:49.520 --> 02:53.200
So you've got a ball approaching a surface with some spin.

02:53.200 --> 02:54.960
The ball has angular momentum.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.520
In other words, it wants to keep spinning.

02:57.520 --> 03:00.160
Yes, I'm anthropomorphizing the ball, but that's okay.

03:00.160 --> 03:02.800
It will want to keep spinning when it touches the surface.

03:02.800 --> 03:06.560
But because of friction, it will have to roll during the collision.

03:06.560 --> 03:09.920
As a result, the ball ends up traveling back the way it came.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.800
In other words, the angular momentum of the ball is turned into a change in linear momentum.

03:14.800 --> 03:17.840
And in fact, the swipe from the underside of the table

03:17.840 --> 03:20.400
results in the ball spinning slowly in the other direction.

03:21.040 --> 03:24.320
The final bounce is pretty boring and what you'd expect,

03:24.320 --> 03:27.520
but it's the bounce that takes the ball back out again.

03:27.520 --> 03:30.960
Now let's double the number of faces the ball has to bounce around.

03:30.960 --> 03:35.760
We're now back to the square container, or as I like to call it, a very low polycylinder.

03:35.760 --> 03:38.480
I'm filming it from the side instead of straight down.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.720
And I've made one of the walls transparent.

03:40.720 --> 03:44.720
I feel like this way it's easier to see what's going on with the spin of the ball.

03:44.720 --> 03:48.880
So when the ball first hits the bottom plate, it gains some spin.

03:48.880 --> 03:53.600
Hopefully it's intuitive to see that the axis of that spin will be in the horizontal plane

03:53.600 --> 03:56.400
and perpendicular to the direction the ball is traveling.

03:56.400 --> 03:59.520
Here I've marked that axis of spin with a couple of pins.

03:59.520 --> 04:02.320
So what happens when the ball hits the second wall?

04:02.320 --> 04:05.440
Well, hopefully you can see that the patch of ball

04:05.440 --> 04:09.040
that touches the wall is moving downwards relative to the wall.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.240
So due to friction, the ball will roll upwards.

04:12.240 --> 04:14.480
In other words, as a result of the spin,

04:14.480 --> 04:18.560
the ball will travel more steeply upwards than it would otherwise.

04:18.560 --> 04:22.720
But we should also expect the spin of the ball to change

04:22.720 --> 04:25.920
as a result of the interaction with that surface.

04:25.920 --> 04:31.600
To figure out what the new spin will be, think about what would happen to the ball

04:31.600 --> 04:36.720
if it didn't have any spin as it came into this second collision.

04:36.720 --> 04:41.040
Well, again, hopefully it's intuitive to see that the spin it would have

04:41.040 --> 04:44.000
after this collision would have an axis like this.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.880
But because it did have spin coming into that collision,

04:46.880 --> 04:50.400
we should expect the new spin to be somewhere between the two.

04:50.400 --> 04:55.200
Somewhere between this axis and the axis it had on the way in.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.280
So maybe it's spinning like this.

04:57.280 --> 04:59.840
And actually that's what we see on the slow motion video.

04:59.840 --> 05:04.560
So what will a ball with this spin traveling in this direction do

05:04.560 --> 05:06.800
when it touches the top surface?

05:06.800 --> 05:09.600
Well, let's imagine that the top surface is transparent as well.

05:10.160 --> 05:14.720
So look, you can see that the patch of ball that touches the top surface

05:14.720 --> 05:16.720
is traveling in this direction.

05:16.720 --> 05:20.480
And again, because it's backspin, because of friction,

05:20.480 --> 05:25.200
that will impart momentum onto the ball in the opposite direction.

05:25.200 --> 05:30.320
And in this case, it's enough to switch from the ball traveling into the container

05:30.320 --> 05:32.960
to the ball traveling out of the container.

05:32.960 --> 05:35.680
And again, the spin of the ball will change.

05:35.680 --> 05:39.760
It's somewhere between this spin and the spin that it had coming in.

05:39.760 --> 05:42.480
And again, that's what we see in the slow motion footage.

05:42.480 --> 05:46.800
You can carry on reasoning in this way until the ball leaves the container.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.720
What if we double the number of faces again?

05:48.720 --> 05:51.120
So it's an eight-sided container.

05:51.120 --> 05:54.800
By the way, if anyone feels like actually building an octagonal container

05:54.800 --> 05:57.280
to test this thing, then please do share the results

05:57.280 --> 06:00.160
in the Science Fair Project channel on my Discord server.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.520
Link to that in the description.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.600
But I'll be using animation for now.

06:03.600 --> 06:07.520
And you'll notice that with more faces, each collision with a face

06:07.520 --> 06:10.320
has less of an effect on the trajectory of the ball.

06:10.320 --> 06:11.520
That's for two reasons.

06:11.520 --> 06:15.680
First, the ball is hitting the next face at a shallower angle.

06:15.680 --> 06:17.600
It's less of a head-on collision.

06:17.600 --> 06:21.600
And secondly, because the ball is already spinning from the first collision,

06:21.600 --> 06:26.000
the movement of the surface of the ball underneath the surface of the container,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
well, they almost match.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.520
Almost, but not exactly.

06:29.520 --> 06:33.520
Let's actually have a look at what happens between two successive bounces

06:33.520 --> 06:36.400
when you've got this shallow angle between the faces.

06:36.400 --> 06:37.920
Just like with the square container,

06:37.920 --> 06:42.160
the spin of the ball modifies the final trajectory of the ball

06:42.160 --> 06:44.240
as it leaves the second surface.

06:44.240 --> 06:45.440
Just less so.

06:45.440 --> 06:47.360
And just like with the square container,

06:47.360 --> 06:54.000
the new spin axis of the ball will be somewhere between this axis and the axis coming in.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.080
Those two axes are much closer to each other,

06:56.080 --> 06:59.200
so the change of the spin axis is less as well.

06:59.200 --> 07:03.760
So if you have smaller changes per bounce, but more bounces,

07:03.760 --> 07:05.360
you end up with the same result.

07:05.360 --> 07:09.040
The ball comes out after about one full turn.

07:09.040 --> 07:10.800
I say about one full turn,

07:10.800 --> 07:14.480
because you might remember from the golf ball paradox video

07:14.560 --> 07:17.600
that the square root of seven divided by two

07:17.600 --> 07:21.600
gives you the number of rotations around the container

07:21.600 --> 07:25.360
for every full vertical oscillation within the container.

07:25.360 --> 07:28.480
But of course, for the ball to get out of the container,

07:28.480 --> 07:31.040
that's just half a vertical oscillation.

07:31.040 --> 07:34.640
So the number of rotations before the ball comes out of the container,

07:34.640 --> 07:38.560
we should expect to be the square root of seven divided by two.

07:38.560 --> 07:39.840
Divided by two.

07:39.840 --> 07:42.160
And that's a little less than one.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.320
And crucially, there's always that inflection point

07:44.320 --> 07:48.560
where the ball transitions from traveling into the container

07:48.560 --> 07:50.800
to traveling out of the container.

07:50.800 --> 07:53.840
We saw that with the square shaped container.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.120
It's when the ball hits the top wall

07:55.120 --> 07:57.680
that it transitions from going in to going out.

07:57.680 --> 08:00.960
In the hexagonal container, we'd expect that inflection to happen

08:00.960 --> 08:02.400
about halfway round.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.000
But the same principle applies.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.360
It's the point when the angular momentum of the ball

08:07.360 --> 08:09.360
is pointing in the right direction

08:09.360 --> 08:12.160
to cause the ball to switch directions.

08:12.160 --> 08:14.640
If we double the number of faces to 16,

08:14.640 --> 08:17.360
then it's starting to look a lot like a cylinder.

08:17.360 --> 08:19.200
In other words, the golf ball paradox

08:19.200 --> 08:21.360
is just what happens in the limit

08:21.360 --> 08:25.040
as the number of faces of your container approaches infinity.

08:25.040 --> 08:27.920
In the original video, I said that if you assume

08:27.920 --> 08:30.480
the axis of rotation of the ball is fixed,

08:30.480 --> 08:32.080
as if it were a gyroscope,

08:32.080 --> 08:35.280
then we would expect the ball to oscillate up and down.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.760
But that it would make one vertical oscillation

08:37.760 --> 08:40.320
after just one single turn around the cylinder.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.440
I said that the reason it takes more than one turn

08:43.440 --> 08:45.680
is because the cylinder kind of drags

08:45.680 --> 08:48.720
the axis of spin of the ball around

08:48.720 --> 08:50.800
as opposed to the axis being fixed.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.200
And I feel like that's easier to see

08:53.200 --> 08:54.880
in the discretized version.

08:54.880 --> 08:59.040
Like when the ball bounces off a surface with spin,

08:59.040 --> 09:01.280
it forces the ball to change direction.

09:01.280 --> 09:04.480
But the collision also changes the spin of the ball.

09:04.480 --> 09:07.440
We see that very nicely in the slow-mo footage here.

09:07.440 --> 09:10.000
And of course, as the number of faces of the container

09:10.000 --> 09:11.440
tends towards infinity,

09:11.440 --> 09:13.920
the number of collisions tends towards infinity,

09:13.920 --> 09:17.280
and those discrete changes in the direction

09:17.280 --> 09:19.200
of the spin of the ball

09:19.200 --> 09:21.760
becomes a continuous change

09:21.760 --> 09:23.520
in the direction of the spin of the ball

09:23.520 --> 09:26.320
as it rolls around the inside of the cylinder.

09:26.320 --> 09:27.600
A couple more really interesting things

09:27.600 --> 09:30.400
that came up after I published the golf ball paradox video.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.080
Patrick Default emailed me to say

09:32.080 --> 09:35.760
he created a simulation of the golf ball paradox.

09:35.760 --> 09:38.320
He'd also previously created simulations

09:38.320 --> 09:40.000
of the ball on a turntable.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.320
I'll leave a link to all of those in the description.

09:42.320 --> 09:45.680
It really is nice to see that it works in simulation as well.

09:45.680 --> 09:46.880
One final thought.

09:46.880 --> 09:49.120
Discretizing the problem in this way

09:49.120 --> 09:51.120
is really interesting for two reasons.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.880
First, it's what Newton did

09:52.880 --> 09:55.200
when he was first looking at orbits.

09:55.200 --> 09:56.960
Well, maybe it was hook, actually.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.720
But anyway, because orbital mechanics

09:58.720 --> 10:00.080
have nonlinear equations,

10:00.080 --> 10:02.960
it's hard to extrapolate where a planet will be in the future.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.400
But if you imagine it instead

10:04.400 --> 10:07.920
as gravity imparting discrete impulses

10:07.920 --> 10:09.520
onto massive objects,

10:09.520 --> 10:11.120
you can go step by step

10:11.120 --> 10:13.600
to figure out where a planet will be in the future.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.320
On that basis, Newton was able to prove

10:16.320 --> 10:18.880
Kepler's equal area law.

10:18.880 --> 10:21.440
And interestingly, software that simulates

10:21.440 --> 10:23.440
the motion of charged particles

10:23.440 --> 10:25.120
uses the same method.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.720
There's something really interesting

10:26.720 --> 10:29.040
about the business of spam.

10:29.040 --> 10:32.240
Like, a lot of the spam we get is sent illegally.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.080
But a lot of it is completely legal,

10:34.080 --> 10:36.560
including some of the spam phone calls that we get.

10:36.560 --> 10:39.120
But despite being legal,

10:39.120 --> 10:41.680
they're actually potentially really dangerous

10:41.680 --> 10:42.960
as well as annoying.

10:42.960 --> 10:46.160
And that's because of the way the business works.

10:46.160 --> 10:49.760
Basically, there are hundreds of these intermediary companies

10:49.760 --> 10:51.280
called data brokers

10:51.280 --> 10:53.520
that collect data about you

10:53.520 --> 10:56.480
and then sell that data onto marketing agencies

10:56.480 --> 10:58.400
that then call you, send you emails,

10:58.400 --> 11:00.160
maybe even send you stuff in the post.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.680
Because they know so much about you,

11:01.680 --> 11:04.240
often you don't realize it's a marketing call

11:04.240 --> 11:05.760
until a little way in,

11:05.760 --> 11:07.280
which is quite frustrating.

11:07.280 --> 11:11.280
But the real danger is that these intermediary data brokers

11:11.280 --> 11:14.160
don't always have great database security.

11:14.160 --> 11:17.360
There are loads of incidents of database breaches,

11:17.360 --> 11:21.120
and these databases have your personal information on them.

11:21.120 --> 11:24.080
So if you want to stop these annoying spam messages

11:24.080 --> 11:28.720
and remove yourself from these potentially vulnerable databases,

11:28.720 --> 11:32.080
then I humbly recommend the sponsor of this video, Incogni.

11:32.080 --> 11:33.360
The way Incogni works is,

11:33.360 --> 11:37.840
all these data brokers have a method of contacting them

11:37.840 --> 11:40.480
to request that they remove your data

11:40.480 --> 11:42.240
and stop selling it to people.

11:42.240 --> 11:44.480
They all want to be contacted in different ways.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.640
So it's a total pain in the bum to do it on your own.

11:46.640 --> 11:49.920
But Incogni have done all the hard work in advance

11:49.920 --> 11:52.720
so that you can just sign up to Incogni,

11:52.720 --> 11:54.560
give them permission to act on your behalf,

11:54.560 --> 11:57.360
and they'll just take care of it all in the background.

11:57.360 --> 11:59.920
Incogni doesn't bombard you with notifications.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.320
You can log on to their dashboard and see the progress.

12:02.320 --> 12:06.480
Look, these are all the companies that now no longer have my data.

12:06.480 --> 12:07.600
And since signing up,

12:07.600 --> 12:10.400
I just don't get those weird phone calls anymore,

12:10.400 --> 12:13.680
the ones where they know a bit too much about me.

12:13.680 --> 12:16.240
If it sounds like the sort of thing that you'd like to get done,

12:16.240 --> 12:17.920
then the promo on this one's really good.

12:17.920 --> 12:21.680
The first 100 people to go to incogni.com forward slash science

12:21.680 --> 12:25.200
and use promo code science to check out will get 60% off.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.800
The link is also in the description,

12:26.800 --> 12:28.400
so check out Incogni today.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.440
