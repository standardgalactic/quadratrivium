1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
It's weirdly difficult to pass a bouncy ball under a table.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,200
The ball always wants to bounce out the same way it came in, which is odd.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,120
This is something that my friend Hugh Hunt showed me ages ago,

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,680
and if you watch my channel a lot, you might be thinking,

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,560
hey, that's really similar to the golf ball paradox from a few videos ago.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,160
If so, you're a lot smarter than I am, because I made the whole golf ball paradox video without

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,280
once thinking about balls bouncing under a table.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,760
But then someone sent me this video.

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,440
Here, the ball bounces around inside a square container and comes back out the way it came in

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,440
without touching the back wall.

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,760
AT, who sent me the video, felt that it was linked to the golf ball paradox.

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,680
Only then did I think, well, hold on, if you can reduce the golf ball paradox down to a ball

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,640
bouncing around the inside of a four-sided shape, why not go further?

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,160
Why not reduce the problem to a ball bouncing between just two surfaces like Hugh showed me

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,840
all those years ago?

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,640
And this is great because, you know, I gave an explanation for the golf ball paradox,

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,960
but I wasn't that happy with it.

18
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,960
And I feel like now I have a great opportunity to explain what's going on in a really intuitive way.

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,240
So here's the plan.

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,920
If I can show that a ball bouncing back to you from under a table makes intuitive sense,

21
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,960
and if I can also show that that continues to make sense as we increase the number of

22
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,320
surfaces that the ball bounces off, well, then we just keep increasing the number of surfaces

23
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,200
until we have essentially a smooth surface.

24
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,680
We have the cylinder from the golf ball paradox.

25
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,960
In other words, we're taking the dynamics of a ball continuously rolling around the inside of a

26
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,200
container and we're discretizing it into lots of little collisions.

27
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,920
So let's first have a look at a ball bouncing under a table and see if we can make sense of that.

28
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,160
So we'll assume the ball isn't spinning at all when it first hits the ground,

29
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,560
but when it does hit the ground, the ground imparts some spin onto the ball,

30
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,320
which makes intuitive sense.

31
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,600
And actually, it's something you're familiar with from everyday life,

32
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,840
like the second bounce of a bouncy ball is often weird and unexpected.

33
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,440
That's just because of the spin that was imparted on the ball from the first bounce.

34
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,800
But to hammer the point home, imagine the interaction from the point of view of the ball

35
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,120
from the ball's reference frame, if you like.

36
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,040
If you have a stationary ball and a wall rushes up to it and swipes it,

37
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,720
the ball will obviously start spinning.

38
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,120
But look what happens now when the spinning ball hits the underside of the table.

39
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,360
Well, when the ball hits the underside of the table, it's got backspin.

40
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,320
And again, you know from experience what happens when a ball has backspin and it hits a surface.

41
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,480
It comes back in the direction of the spin.

42
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,440
And that makes intuitive sense if you think about it in slow motion.

43
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,520
Let's all pretend that I've keyed out my hand in this shot and you can only see the ball.

44
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,200
So you've got a ball approaching a surface with some spin.

45
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,960
The ball has angular momentum.

46
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,520
In other words, it wants to keep spinning.

47
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,160
Yes, I'm anthropomorphizing the ball, but that's okay.

48
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,800
It will want to keep spinning when it touches the surface.

49
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,560
But because of friction, it will have to roll during the collision.

50
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,920
As a result, the ball ends up traveling back the way it came.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,800
In other words, the angular momentum of the ball is turned into a change in linear momentum.

52
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,840
And in fact, the swipe from the underside of the table

53
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,400
results in the ball spinning slowly in the other direction.

54
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,320
The final bounce is pretty boring and what you'd expect,

55
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,520
but it's the bounce that takes the ball back out again.

56
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,960
Now let's double the number of faces the ball has to bounce around.

57
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,760
We're now back to the square container, or as I like to call it, a very low polycylinder.

58
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,480
I'm filming it from the side instead of straight down.

59
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,720
And I've made one of the walls transparent.

60
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,720
I feel like this way it's easier to see what's going on with the spin of the ball.

61
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,880
So when the ball first hits the bottom plate, it gains some spin.

62
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,600
Hopefully it's intuitive to see that the axis of that spin will be in the horizontal plane

63
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,400
and perpendicular to the direction the ball is traveling.

64
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,520
Here I've marked that axis of spin with a couple of pins.

65
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,320
So what happens when the ball hits the second wall?

66
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,440
Well, hopefully you can see that the patch of ball

67
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,040
that touches the wall is moving downwards relative to the wall.

68
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,240
So due to friction, the ball will roll upwards.

69
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,480
In other words, as a result of the spin,

70
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,560
the ball will travel more steeply upwards than it would otherwise.

71
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,720
But we should also expect the spin of the ball to change

72
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,920
as a result of the interaction with that surface.

73
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,600
To figure out what the new spin will be, think about what would happen to the ball

74
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,720
if it didn't have any spin as it came into this second collision.

75
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,040
Well, again, hopefully it's intuitive to see that the spin it would have

76
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,000
after this collision would have an axis like this.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,880
But because it did have spin coming into that collision,

78
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,400
we should expect the new spin to be somewhere between the two.

79
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,200
Somewhere between this axis and the axis it had on the way in.

80
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,280
So maybe it's spinning like this.

81
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,840
And actually that's what we see on the slow motion video.

82
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,560
So what will a ball with this spin traveling in this direction do

83
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,800
when it touches the top surface?

84
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,600
Well, let's imagine that the top surface is transparent as well.

85
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,720
So look, you can see that the patch of ball that touches the top surface

86
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
is traveling in this direction.

87
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,480
And again, because it's backspin, because of friction,

88
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,200
that will impart momentum onto the ball in the opposite direction.

89
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,320
And in this case, it's enough to switch from the ball traveling into the container

90
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,960
to the ball traveling out of the container.

91
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,680
And again, the spin of the ball will change.

92
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,760
It's somewhere between this spin and the spin that it had coming in.

93
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,480
And again, that's what we see in the slow motion footage.

94
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,800
You can carry on reasoning in this way until the ball leaves the container.

95
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,720
What if we double the number of faces again?

96
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,120
So it's an eight-sided container.

97
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,800
By the way, if anyone feels like actually building an octagonal container

98
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,280
to test this thing, then please do share the results

99
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,160
in the Science Fair Project channel on my Discord server.

100
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,520
Link to that in the description.

101
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,600
But I'll be using animation for now.

102
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,520
And you'll notice that with more faces, each collision with a face

103
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,320
has less of an effect on the trajectory of the ball.

104
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,520
That's for two reasons.

105
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,680
First, the ball is hitting the next face at a shallower angle.

106
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,600
It's less of a head-on collision.

107
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,600
And secondly, because the ball is already spinning from the first collision,

108
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,000
the movement of the surface of the ball underneath the surface of the container,

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
well, they almost match.

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,520
Almost, but not exactly.

111
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,520
Let's actually have a look at what happens between two successive bounces

112
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,400
when you've got this shallow angle between the faces.

113
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,920
Just like with the square container,

114
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,160
the spin of the ball modifies the final trajectory of the ball

115
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,240
as it leaves the second surface.

116
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,440
Just less so.

117
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,360
And just like with the square container,

118
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:54,000
the new spin axis of the ball will be somewhere between this axis and the axis coming in.

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,080
Those two axes are much closer to each other,

120
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,200
so the change of the spin axis is less as well.

121
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,760
So if you have smaller changes per bounce, but more bounces,

122
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,360
you end up with the same result.

123
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,040
The ball comes out after about one full turn.

124
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,800
I say about one full turn,

125
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,480
because you might remember from the golf ball paradox video

126
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,600
that the square root of seven divided by two

127
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,600
gives you the number of rotations around the container

128
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,360
for every full vertical oscillation within the container.

129
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,480
But of course, for the ball to get out of the container,

130
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,040
that's just half a vertical oscillation.

131
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,640
So the number of rotations before the ball comes out of the container,

132
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,560
we should expect to be the square root of seven divided by two.

133
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,840
Divided by two.

134
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,160
And that's a little less than one.

135
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,320
And crucially, there's always that inflection point

136
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,560
where the ball transitions from traveling into the container

137
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,800
to traveling out of the container.

138
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,840
We saw that with the square shaped container.

139
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,120
It's when the ball hits the top wall

140
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,680
that it transitions from going in to going out.

141
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,960
In the hexagonal container, we'd expect that inflection to happen

142
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,400
about halfway round.

143
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,000
But the same principle applies.

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,360
It's the point when the angular momentum of the ball

145
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
is pointing in the right direction

146
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,160
to cause the ball to switch directions.

147
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,640
If we double the number of faces to 16,

148
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,360
then it's starting to look a lot like a cylinder.

149
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,200
In other words, the golf ball paradox

150
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,360
is just what happens in the limit

151
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,040
as the number of faces of your container approaches infinity.

152
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,920
In the original video, I said that if you assume

153
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,480
the axis of rotation of the ball is fixed,

154
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,080
as if it were a gyroscope,

155
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,280
then we would expect the ball to oscillate up and down.

156
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,760
But that it would make one vertical oscillation

157
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,320
after just one single turn around the cylinder.

158
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,440
I said that the reason it takes more than one turn

159
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,680
is because the cylinder kind of drags

160
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,720
the axis of spin of the ball around

161
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,800
as opposed to the axis being fixed.

162
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,200
And I feel like that's easier to see

163
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,880
in the discretized version.

164
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,040
Like when the ball bounces off a surface with spin,

165
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,280
it forces the ball to change direction.

166
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,480
But the collision also changes the spin of the ball.

167
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,440
We see that very nicely in the slow-mo footage here.

168
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,000
And of course, as the number of faces of the container

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,440
tends towards infinity,

170
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,920
the number of collisions tends towards infinity,

171
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,280
and those discrete changes in the direction

172
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,200
of the spin of the ball

173
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,760
becomes a continuous change

174
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,520
in the direction of the spin of the ball

175
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,320
as it rolls around the inside of the cylinder.

176
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,600
A couple more really interesting things

177
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,400
that came up after I published the golf ball paradox video.

178
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,080
Patrick Default emailed me to say

179
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,760
he created a simulation of the golf ball paradox.

180
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,320
He'd also previously created simulations

181
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,000
of the ball on a turntable.

182
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,320
I'll leave a link to all of those in the description.

183
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,680
It really is nice to see that it works in simulation as well.

184
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,880
One final thought.

185
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,120
Discretizing the problem in this way

186
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,120
is really interesting for two reasons.

187
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,880
First, it's what Newton did

188
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,200
when he was first looking at orbits.

189
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,960
Well, maybe it was hook, actually.

190
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,720
But anyway, because orbital mechanics

191
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,080
have nonlinear equations,

192
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,960
it's hard to extrapolate where a planet will be in the future.

193
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,400
But if you imagine it instead

194
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,920
as gravity imparting discrete impulses

195
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,520
onto massive objects,

196
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,120
you can go step by step

197
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,600
to figure out where a planet will be in the future.

198
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,320
On that basis, Newton was able to prove

199
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,880
Kepler's equal area law.

200
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,440
And interestingly, software that simulates

201
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,440
the motion of charged particles

202
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,120
uses the same method.

203
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,720
There's something really interesting

204
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,040
about the business of spam.

205
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,240
Like, a lot of the spam we get is sent illegally.

206
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,080
But a lot of it is completely legal,

207
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,560
including some of the spam phone calls that we get.

208
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,120
But despite being legal,

209
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,680
they're actually potentially really dangerous

210
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,960
as well as annoying.

211
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,160
And that's because of the way the business works.

212
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,760
Basically, there are hundreds of these intermediary companies

213
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,280
called data brokers

214
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,520
that collect data about you

215
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,480
and then sell that data onto marketing agencies

216
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,400
that then call you, send you emails,

217
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,160
maybe even send you stuff in the post.

218
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,680
Because they know so much about you,

219
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,240
often you don't realize it's a marketing call

220
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,760
until a little way in,

221
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,280
which is quite frustrating.

222
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,280
But the real danger is that these intermediary data brokers

223
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,160
don't always have great database security.

224
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,360
There are loads of incidents of database breaches,

225
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,120
and these databases have your personal information on them.

226
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,080
So if you want to stop these annoying spam messages

227
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,720
and remove yourself from these potentially vulnerable databases,

228
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,080
then I humbly recommend the sponsor of this video, Incogni.

229
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,360
The way Incogni works is,

230
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,840
all these data brokers have a method of contacting them

231
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,480
to request that they remove your data

232
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,240
and stop selling it to people.

233
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,480
They all want to be contacted in different ways.

234
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,640
So it's a total pain in the bum to do it on your own.

235
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,920
But Incogni have done all the hard work in advance

236
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,720
so that you can just sign up to Incogni,

237
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,560
give them permission to act on your behalf,

238
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,360
and they'll just take care of it all in the background.

239
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,920
Incogni doesn't bombard you with notifications.

240
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,320
You can log on to their dashboard and see the progress.

241
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,480
Look, these are all the companies that now no longer have my data.

242
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,600
And since signing up,

243
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,400
I just don't get those weird phone calls anymore,

244
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,680
the ones where they know a bit too much about me.

245
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,240
If it sounds like the sort of thing that you'd like to get done,

246
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,920
then the promo on this one's really good.

247
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,680
The first 100 people to go to incogni.com forward slash science

248
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,200
