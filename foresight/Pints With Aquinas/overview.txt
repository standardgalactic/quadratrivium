Checking Pints With Aquinas/Heated Debate on Pornography w⧸ Dennis Prager  @PragerU​.txt
1. In a discussion about sexual desires and mastery over lower passions, the comparison was made between the necessity of eating to survive and the choice to engage in sexual activity. The key point is that while we must eat to live, we do not have to indulge in every sexual desire.

2. The ideal situation, as agreed upon by both parties, is for individuals to have mastery over their sexual desires and use them appropriately, especially within the context of a loving marriage where both partners are considerate towards each other outside of the bedroom, making the intimate acts inside the bedroom more meaningful.

3. A reference was made to Rabbi Schmuley Boteach, who wrote "Kosher Sex" and advocates for sex to be holy within marriage, as opposed to using it solely for animalistic pleasure. He is against pornography for similar reasons as the person in the clip.
