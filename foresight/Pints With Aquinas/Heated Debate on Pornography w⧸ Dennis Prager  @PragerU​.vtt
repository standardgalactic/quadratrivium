WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.080
Let's talk about the pornography thing.

00:03.080 --> 00:04.080
Right.

00:04.080 --> 00:05.080
Well, that was...

00:05.080 --> 00:06.240
How did that go when you discussed it with Father Dave?

00:06.240 --> 00:08.680
Well, you'll have to ask the people there.

00:08.680 --> 00:10.920
I mean, I can only judge it from my perspective.

00:10.920 --> 00:12.680
I thought it went terrific.

00:12.680 --> 00:16.680
When I saw that clip of you in Exodus, I got the sense that you were a bit sidelined.

00:16.680 --> 00:17.680
Or totally.

00:17.680 --> 00:22.280
And if somebody who has a talk show, I wish that I could go back and rephrase things or

00:22.280 --> 00:23.280
add some new ones to...

00:23.280 --> 00:24.280
Well, that's correct.

00:24.280 --> 00:25.280
That is exactly how I wrote a letter.

00:25.280 --> 00:28.280
I hope you saw it.

00:28.280 --> 00:33.380
It was the last thing I imagined being asked at an Exodus course with Jordan Peterson

00:33.380 --> 00:38.160
and a bunch of scholars whom I adored, by the way.

00:38.160 --> 00:42.880
Nevertheless, I should have...

00:42.880 --> 00:46.040
I wish I had phrased it better.

00:46.040 --> 00:52.920
It is what it is, and I phrased it better tonight without being untrue to myself.

00:52.920 --> 00:59.520
And what I did not see, a big part of the problem, should I review this for your watchers,

00:59.520 --> 01:00.520
listeners?

01:00.520 --> 01:01.520
Review?

01:01.520 --> 01:05.000
Review what happened so that they'll understand what we're talking about.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.720
So I...

01:06.720 --> 01:11.760
The Daily Wire asked me to join Jordan Peterson, or Jordan Peterson asked me to Jordan...

01:11.760 --> 01:15.920
Or both of them asked, because he's doing the book of...

01:15.920 --> 01:17.200
Did the book of Exodus?

01:17.200 --> 01:22.000
They were, I believe, 16 sessions of 90 minutes each.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.720
That's a lot, a lot of time, with no commercials.

01:25.720 --> 01:27.720
How many days did you film this in?

01:27.720 --> 01:28.720
Oh, eight days.

01:28.720 --> 01:29.720
Eight days.

01:29.720 --> 01:32.680
Yes, eight days each time in Miami.

01:32.680 --> 01:34.680
And it was wonderful.

01:34.680 --> 01:35.920
I loved it.

01:35.920 --> 01:42.640
So what arose at one time, and I've even forgotten about this, it was five minutes out of...

01:42.640 --> 01:48.040
Let's see, what is 16 times an hour and a half, 24 hours.

01:48.040 --> 01:51.520
So it's five minutes out of 24 hours.

01:51.960 --> 01:58.640
What happened was, I don't even remember how the issue arose, but I mentioned that there

01:58.640 --> 02:04.520
is a Jewish-Christian difference with regard to Jesus' statement that a man who lost after

02:04.520 --> 02:07.840
another woman has committed adultery with his heart.

02:07.840 --> 02:13.720
That A, that phrase does not appear, obviously, in the Hebrew Bible, but B, that the general

02:13.720 --> 02:19.600
Jewish view, and I say general because I can't speak for all Jews, even though I try to be

02:19.600 --> 02:29.000
normative, is that you can only commit adultery with, and I said this in the video, and I

02:29.000 --> 02:33.480
purposely said, I'm not trying at all to be cute in any way.

02:33.480 --> 02:38.560
You can only commit adultery with one organ and it is not the heart.

02:38.560 --> 02:42.360
Judaism is very behavior-based.

02:42.360 --> 02:46.520
Christianity is more...

02:46.520 --> 02:53.680
It's not that it's not behavior-based, but it is equally, if not more, thought, inner-self,

02:53.680 --> 02:56.680
heart-based.

02:56.680 --> 03:01.600
So for example, there's a phrase in Hebrew that I learned very early in my Yeshiva education.

03:01.600 --> 03:05.120
I'll say it in Hebrew so that people will know I didn't make it up.

03:05.120 --> 03:09.680
Oh, ha'mah shavah, yikar el ha'mah, say it is not the thought that counts, that, no, not

03:09.680 --> 03:14.320
that counts, that is the essence, but the deed.

03:14.320 --> 03:17.240
Judaism is very behavior-ist, and I am very behavior-ist.

03:17.240 --> 03:24.280
So for example, and I mention this at Franciscan, I've said on the radio very often, I don't

03:24.280 --> 03:28.800
care if you like Jews, I don't care if you dislike Jews, I prefer you like Jews, but

03:28.800 --> 03:32.920
there are a lot of Jews I don't like, I mean it's just a little silly to say I like a whole

03:32.920 --> 03:37.720
group, there's no whole group I like, there's no whole group I dislike, but in any event,

03:37.720 --> 03:42.200
I don't care if you dislike Jews, I care how you treat Jews.

03:42.200 --> 03:52.720
And that is, it goes to the essence of what my belief is, I want to know how you act.

03:52.720 --> 04:01.080
The left does this all the time, oh, you treat gays beautifully, like in my case, my wife

04:01.080 --> 04:07.240
and I are godparents to a gay couple's children, but the fact that I'm against a same-sex marriage,

04:07.240 --> 04:08.520
that makes me a hater.

04:08.520 --> 04:15.120
So how I treat gays is irrelevant, it's what I think.

04:15.120 --> 04:20.600
This bothers me that your thoughts can be regarded as a demerit.

04:20.600 --> 04:24.760
But see, your thoughts wouldn't be uncharitable towards people with same-sex attraction, you

04:24.760 --> 04:30.280
would just think that the behavior is presumably sinful.

04:30.280 --> 04:33.200
So they would be wrong in their thinking of you as a homophobe.

04:33.560 --> 04:40.760
Bothers me the most is that we redefine marriage.

04:40.760 --> 04:45.160
My Leviticus commentary comes out, that'll be the fifth of my five-volume commentary

04:45.160 --> 04:52.400
on the Torah, I have already written 22,000 words on one verse, which of course I've never

04:52.400 --> 04:59.040
done for any other verse about a man shall not lie with a man as with a woman.

04:59.040 --> 05:06.360
And so without even getting into that, the point I wanted to make was, for the left,

05:06.360 --> 05:11.160
what I think renders me awful, not what I do.

05:11.160 --> 05:18.680
So my treatment of gays is excellent, but the fact that I don't think marriage should

05:18.680 --> 05:24.320
be redefined is enough to make me a hater, bigot, homophobe, and all the other terms

05:24.320 --> 05:25.320
that they use.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.040
Anyway, back to us.

05:27.040 --> 05:30.160
Let me interject here.

05:30.160 --> 05:35.240
So Aristotle in the Nicomachean Ethics has these four levels of the vicious to the virtuous

05:35.240 --> 05:36.240
man.

05:36.240 --> 05:40.360
The vicious man is the one who wants to do evil and does it, and he has the incontinent

05:40.360 --> 05:44.280
man, the continent man, but he says the virtuous man is the one who wants to do the good and

05:44.280 --> 05:45.360
does it.

05:45.360 --> 05:52.640
And so to me, I have children, if one of them held anti-Semitic views but treated you kindly,

05:52.640 --> 05:58.120
I would say, well, that's better than holding anti-Semitic views and being bad toward you,

05:58.120 --> 05:59.120
but I wouldn't.

05:59.120 --> 06:00.960
I would think that's not where I would settle.

06:00.960 --> 06:01.960
I would want him to...

06:01.960 --> 06:02.960
That's fine.

06:02.960 --> 06:03.960
That's fine.

06:03.960 --> 06:04.960
I respect that.

06:04.960 --> 06:10.800
And I also want to say that I think I agree with you that obviously adultery and lust

06:10.800 --> 06:11.800
are different things.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.760
If they weren't different things, we wouldn't have two separate words for them.

06:14.760 --> 06:15.760
Right?

06:15.760 --> 06:16.760
Yeah.

06:16.880 --> 06:25.000
Which comes somewhat of a revelation to my Christian friends is there is no sin of the...

06:25.000 --> 06:29.160
There are 613 laws in the Torah, none of them say do not lust.

06:29.160 --> 06:30.360
You can't covet.

06:30.360 --> 06:33.880
Covet is a very different concept than lust.

06:33.880 --> 06:37.680
Covet means you want to take what belongs to another, and it is a very simple proof

06:37.680 --> 06:39.120
that it doesn't mean lust.

06:39.120 --> 06:45.080
Covet, you don't lust after a house or a donkey, one presumes, and yet you're not allowed

06:45.080 --> 06:46.560
to covet those either.

06:46.560 --> 06:49.760
So do you make a distinction between sexual desire and lust?

06:49.760 --> 06:50.760
Do you see a distinction?

06:50.760 --> 06:51.760
No, I don't.

06:51.760 --> 06:52.760
Okay.

06:52.760 --> 06:55.800
So therefore, if you don't see a distinction between those two things, I can see why you

06:55.800 --> 06:57.560
would think it insane to tell somebody they shouldn't lust.

06:57.560 --> 07:01.960
I don't know how you sexually desire your wife and have no lust for her.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.560
Oh, I do.

07:03.560 --> 07:04.560
Okay.

07:04.560 --> 07:05.560
So I would think that...

07:05.560 --> 07:06.560
That's interesting.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.560
I would think that lust...

07:07.560 --> 07:08.560
So you think so lust...

07:08.560 --> 07:09.560
Okay.

07:09.560 --> 07:10.560
Yeah, you're right.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.560
This is interesting.

07:11.560 --> 07:12.560
I've never confronted it quite this way.

07:12.560 --> 07:13.560
So lust is...

07:13.560 --> 07:15.560
Lust reduces the subject to an object.

07:15.560 --> 07:20.480
It subordinates the dignity of the person to the good of a selfish pleasure.

07:20.480 --> 07:23.440
It's also a distorted sexual act.

07:23.440 --> 07:31.560
So it's an act which is contrary to human nature or to the end of the sexual act.

07:31.560 --> 07:37.000
So if sexual desire and lust are different, can you sexually desire a woman you're not

07:37.000 --> 07:38.800
married to and not lust for her?

07:38.800 --> 07:39.800
Yes.

07:39.800 --> 07:40.800
Oh.

07:40.800 --> 07:41.800
I would think so.

07:41.800 --> 07:42.800
Okay.

07:42.800 --> 07:43.800
I haven't heard that from a Christian before.

07:43.840 --> 07:46.160
Three stages, if I would think of it.

07:46.160 --> 07:50.560
If I board an airplane and I sit next to a beautiful woman and I'm attracted to her

07:50.560 --> 07:52.680
sexually, how could I not be?

07:52.680 --> 07:53.680
Okay.

07:53.680 --> 07:54.680
That's beyond my control.

07:54.680 --> 07:59.040
Now, the next step could be, now what do I do with that?

07:59.040 --> 08:02.080
Do I sit here and fantasize about what I could do with her sexually?

08:02.080 --> 08:06.600
At that point, the will is engaged and that is something within my control.

08:06.600 --> 08:10.520
So I think it is important to make that distinction and I think that might be part of what drives

08:10.520 --> 08:16.240
some Christians neurotic if they think, well, sexual desire is a sin, can't sexually desire

08:16.240 --> 08:18.240
anybody who isn't my wife.

08:18.240 --> 08:25.360
Not only Christians, but I think in some cases with Jews too, that it does drive people

08:25.360 --> 08:26.360
to be neurotic.

08:26.360 --> 08:28.920
It's like if I said you don't think of a pink elephant.

08:28.920 --> 08:30.920
Well, better.

08:30.920 --> 08:35.760
You're in a restaurant, don't think of food because that's a real life.

08:35.760 --> 08:36.760
Very bad.

08:36.760 --> 08:37.760
Stop it.

08:37.760 --> 08:38.760
Yeah.

08:38.760 --> 08:39.760
You'd go crazy.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.160
The more you don't think about it, the more you think about it.

08:42.160 --> 08:44.480
So there's that element too.

08:44.480 --> 08:45.480
Agreed.

08:45.480 --> 08:52.600
So I differ with you and I did with the father and by the way, I mentioned this is very important

08:52.600 --> 08:53.600
to note.

08:53.600 --> 08:58.600
What a credit it is to Franciscan University A having me, A as a religious Jew obviously

08:58.600 --> 09:05.840
doesn't believe in Christ, not a Christian, and B that they discuss openly with me at

09:05.840 --> 09:11.200
the university what they heard me say on Daily Wire.

09:11.200 --> 09:16.960
But he did raise this issue about sexual objectification and that reduces the human

09:16.960 --> 09:23.200
being as one created God's image, et cetera, just what you said now.

09:23.200 --> 09:27.360
And I have a different view of that.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.360
Sure.

09:28.360 --> 09:33.920
I think this, I suspect you may have not heard this before in one of your podcasts.

09:33.920 --> 09:34.920
Here we go.

09:34.920 --> 09:36.640
Here's one of your guests.

09:36.640 --> 09:44.840
I think that in the bedroom, if a loving husband who is a loving husband and I have

09:44.840 --> 09:50.280
a word to say about what a loving husband is, a loving husband who sees his wife in

09:50.280 --> 09:56.520
the bedroom as a sexual object, I will be totally open with you.

09:56.520 --> 10:02.680
I have said on the radio, if after X number of years married, your husband still sees

10:02.680 --> 10:06.440
you as a sex object, you are both very lucky.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.600
I would say it depends what you mean by sex object.

10:08.600 --> 10:12.480
If what you mean is your husband continues to find you sexually desirable, I would agree

10:12.480 --> 10:13.600
with you.

10:13.600 --> 10:19.280
If what you mean is the man essentially treats his wife as a warm body to masturbate in, not

10:19.280 --> 10:23.080
taking into account her feelings, her desires.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.400
Oh, of course.

10:24.400 --> 10:30.800
But that's not objectification as a dirty meme.

10:30.800 --> 10:36.320
He said, the father said, one shouldn't even objectivize baseball players.

10:36.320 --> 10:37.720
And it was an excellent analogy.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.420
I had thought of that myself.

10:39.420 --> 10:41.600
But I do objectivize the baseball player.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.320
I'm not sure if I agree with him.

10:43.320 --> 10:48.520
But it doesn't mean that you would automatically mistreat the baseball player.

10:48.520 --> 10:49.520
That's right.

10:49.520 --> 10:52.240
But I'm in a different relationship with the baseball player than I am with the one I

10:52.240 --> 10:53.240
married to.

10:53.240 --> 10:54.240
Correct.

10:54.240 --> 10:55.240
But there is a place in the totality of a relationship.

10:55.240 --> 10:59.400
So here is my motto because I talk about men and women every week for an hour on my radio

10:59.400 --> 11:01.880
show and I have for about 20 years.

11:01.880 --> 11:07.880
And that is you make love outside the bedroom and you have sex inside the bedroom.

11:07.880 --> 11:13.760
I think it's a romanticization of the sex act to say that it's always making love.

11:13.760 --> 11:16.040
It's OK to make lust.

11:16.040 --> 11:18.520
It's OK to have some objectification.

11:18.520 --> 11:20.760
That doesn't mean you're mistreating her.

11:20.760 --> 11:23.120
Yeah, I think I'd want to know what you mean by objectification.

11:23.120 --> 11:27.520
Because I had the sense that you're using language to convey something that I might agree with.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.520
Yes, you might.

11:28.520 --> 11:29.520
You really might.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.520
I agree with you.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.120
It certainly doesn't mean mistreat.

11:32.120 --> 11:33.740
It's not even implied.

11:33.740 --> 11:37.440
But any more than with the baseball player.

11:37.440 --> 11:41.080
And you'll say, well, I have a different relationship with the baseball player, but you're right.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.080
Sex is its own world.

11:43.080 --> 11:46.080
I don't like to romanticize sex.

11:46.080 --> 11:50.040
Sex is many, many things.

11:50.040 --> 11:51.480
Sometimes it's love.

11:51.480 --> 11:53.120
Sometimes it's just pure sex.

11:53.120 --> 11:57.800
When it's pure sex and not just love, there is an element of objectification.

11:58.280 --> 12:01.480
I'm crazy about her legs.

12:01.480 --> 12:04.080
Is that a statement of love?

12:04.080 --> 12:04.520
What do you mean?

12:04.520 --> 12:05.640
You don't love legs.

12:05.640 --> 12:06.520
What do you mean by love?

12:06.520 --> 12:06.720
Right.

12:06.720 --> 12:12.480
So I would say Aristotle and Aquinas would say that to love is to will the good of the other for their sake.

12:12.480 --> 12:14.640
So I don't will my wife's good for my sake.

12:14.640 --> 12:18.560
It's not like I say, honey, I really need you to go to CrossFit so I can lust after you.

12:18.560 --> 12:19.440
Well, what?

12:19.440 --> 12:21.920
But if I want her to get healthy for her sake, then this is love.

12:21.920 --> 12:27.160
But if she says to you, honey, there's a certain thing that you could do for me sexually

12:27.200 --> 12:28.920
that will really turn me on.

12:28.920 --> 12:30.960
And it may not really turn you on.

12:30.960 --> 12:35.400
Are you being objectivized or are you doing it because you love her and because she wants it?

12:35.400 --> 12:39.640
Well, first of all, she's asked a question in which I presumably am free to decline as she.

12:39.640 --> 12:42.680
Oh, if she's not free to decline, that's coercion.

12:42.680 --> 12:43.680
And there's no room for that.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.640
Right. So there is an objectification of coercion or not the same thing.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.040
Which I'm free to decline.

12:48.040 --> 12:52.560
Right. So, honey, would you put on this sexy outfit for me?

12:52.560 --> 12:53.720
Are you OK with that?

12:53.720 --> 12:55.280
Me? Yeah.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.520
Buddy, hell, that's a question I didn't expect you to ask me.

12:57.520 --> 12:58.520
Well, you opened it up.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.480
I would not be OK with that.

13:02.480 --> 13:03.680
That's interesting. I don't think.

13:03.680 --> 13:05.200
Even in the bedroom.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.560
It's not that I'd be morally opposed to it.

13:07.560 --> 13:10.520
It's just that I'd feel uncomfortable with it.

13:10.520 --> 13:15.560
Well, my view is that the more comfort the couple has, the better the relationship.

13:15.560 --> 13:16.560
I think that's right.

13:16.560 --> 13:21.640
So long as comfort doesn't lead to what I would consider to be sexually perverse acts.

13:21.640 --> 13:25.200
Well, why is it sexually perverse to wear a sexy outfit?

13:25.200 --> 13:27.800
It's not. And that's why I said I'm not morally opposed to it.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.800
But if you're saying that the discomfort is personal, that's fair.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.200
I that's not an area I need to get into.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.400
One thing I would love you to get into, because you did say this in the email,

13:36.400 --> 13:41.520
is you think that the widespread proliferation of property is destroying teenagers.

13:41.520 --> 13:45.360
Help help help help people hear this side of what I given.

13:45.360 --> 13:46.560
I gave an example tonight.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.360
So I'm very friendly with a young woman.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.760
She's 23, very, very close to her.

13:51.120 --> 13:55.600
People could guess who it is, because I do a podcast with her.

13:56.280 --> 13:57.800
So she is so open.

13:57.800 --> 13:58.520
God bless her.

13:58.520 --> 14:02.080
I don't think she would object to my to my telling this story.

14:03.320 --> 14:06.200
In fact, maybe it was even discussed on one of our podcasts.

14:06.200 --> 14:07.920
We're very, very open.

14:07.920 --> 14:12.480
So she was on a date and they were both a track.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.520
It was not the first date and they kissed.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.480
It's all they did. They kissed.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.760
And in the midst of the kiss, he he grabbed her neck.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.280
Oh, like this.

14:22.280 --> 14:24.440
And even me, Mr.

14:24.440 --> 14:26.880
Open was taken aback.

14:27.680 --> 14:30.800
And and so was she to her credit.

14:31.360 --> 14:37.080
She when she took his hand away, she said either then or later

14:37.080 --> 14:39.360
that evening or later another time.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.680
Why did you do that?

14:41.680 --> 14:45.680
And he to his credit was open enough to say, I thought you would like it.

14:45.960 --> 14:48.000
That's what I see on the Internet.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.360
That's a bad thing that that's that's

14:53.840 --> 14:59.120
the number of young men who learn about women through porn

14:59.120 --> 15:03.400
and not real life is a very scary thing that has developed.

15:03.800 --> 15:07.080
So I am I am as worried as you are

15:07.880 --> 15:10.440
about the pornification of society.

15:11.040 --> 15:14.760
When I answered the question that Jordan Peterson asked,

15:14.760 --> 15:16.760
which came out of nowhere, I'm not blaming him in the least.

15:16.800 --> 15:19.160
It was a perfectly legit question, but it came out of nowhere.

15:19.720 --> 15:24.640
I was thinking still in the way I have always defined it as Playboy magazine.

15:25.280 --> 15:28.280
That to me, that was porn.

15:28.280 --> 15:32.360
The stuff that is out there now is not what I think of when I'm asked the question.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.760
And and so I did say this to the father tonight,

15:37.880 --> 15:40.040
and I'm sure it shocked everybody there.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.440
Did you ask it? No, keep going.

15:42.080 --> 15:43.240
Make a bad you'll get it.

15:43.240 --> 15:46.560
You'll get a charge out of this intellectually.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.360
It'll blow your mind, I think.

15:48.360 --> 15:51.480
So my dad was an Orthodox Jew, a modern Orthodox, admittedly,

15:51.480 --> 15:55.560
but Orthodox did never drove on the Sabbath, never ate a non kosher food.

15:55.600 --> 15:58.400
Wariamolka and the house sent the kids to Yeshiva.

15:58.680 --> 16:01.320
I mean, he was the real deal.

16:01.320 --> 16:04.160
He was the president of the Kingsway Jewish Center.

16:04.160 --> 16:07.160
Still exists an Orthodox synagogue in Brooklyn, New York.

16:08.040 --> 16:13.320
And he subscribed to Playboy, which shocks Jews as well as non-Jews, to be honest.

16:13.320 --> 16:14.880
Good. OK. Yeah.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.640
Glad that it does. Yes. OK.

16:17.640 --> 16:21.920
However, so I I I was raised in a very sexually open home

16:21.920 --> 16:25.960
that was also deeply religious, and I never found them conflicting

16:26.920 --> 16:28.520
as he didn't.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.440
And so he was an outlier.

16:30.440 --> 16:32.280
I acknowledge and I am an outlier.

16:32.280 --> 16:33.320
I acknowledge.

16:33.320 --> 16:38.760
However, I want people to understand my parents were together 72 years

16:39.560 --> 16:43.560
and they loved each other crazy when she died at eighty nine.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.600
He died at ninety six.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.880
He basically his life ended.

16:49.920 --> 16:52.640
His screensaver was I love you, Hindi.

16:52.640 --> 16:53.800
That was his nickname for her.

16:53.800 --> 16:57.960
Her name was Hilda, and she knew he got Playboy.

16:58.360 --> 17:01.400
This did not did not trouble my mother.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.280
Oh, that's Mac. OK.

17:03.280 --> 17:06.800
I'm married to a live wire who was faithful and who loved me.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.760
And she was crazy about him.

17:08.760 --> 17:10.800
And that and that and that was it.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.680
What would be better for your father

17:12.680 --> 17:15.920
to love your mother and get Playboy or for your father to say,

17:15.920 --> 17:18.120
even though I'm tempted to look at pornography,

17:18.480 --> 17:21.840
my wife's body is enough for me and I'm not going to look at that,

17:21.840 --> 17:24.440
even though I'm tempted to. That's a very fair question.

17:25.880 --> 17:31.520
I don't have an answer, which will I should give you the answer you want.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.040
I think you should, too. Yes, that's a good point.

17:34.040 --> 17:38.040
You do. I don't know what that means enough.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.360
As I said, which bothers is funny.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.800
There were two groups that it bothers.

17:42.800 --> 17:46.320
The very religious and the radical feminist.

17:46.760 --> 17:51.640
When I say that men are variety built in,

17:51.640 --> 17:56.080
God made male sexual nature as variety oriented as one.

17:56.880 --> 17:59.120
I don't know who put it this way, but one would put it.

17:59.880 --> 18:02.160
A woman loves a man and men love women.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.800
Now, I don't want men to go around loving women.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.280
I'm totally opposed to that.

18:06.280 --> 18:11.400
I am I am and insist on my being.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.360
It's not it's not even debatable that I am faithful to my wife.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.080
It's a given.

18:16.080 --> 18:19.200
My wife knows that other women are a turn on.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.560
She knows it. It does not bother her.

18:21.920 --> 18:25.760
She she is she to my luck.

18:26.280 --> 18:30.680
I am married to a woman who does not find male sexual nature frightening.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.600
Most women do. And by the way, I understand that.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.160
But again, I think we have to make the distinction

18:35.160 --> 18:39.960
between sexual arousal and sitting and fantasizing or watching.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.280
Actually, they looked at it together.

18:42.280 --> 18:44.600
And if you. Well, that's sad, too, I think.

18:44.640 --> 18:45.920
I don't. Why is it said?

18:45.920 --> 18:49.680
Because I think pornography is a version of the sexual act.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.320
Yeah. Well, OK, which is holy.

18:51.320 --> 18:52.520
What if they looked OK?

18:52.520 --> 18:55.400
Let me finish, which is God's first commandment to humanity.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.040
Be fruitful and multiply.

18:57.040 --> 19:00.080
It is the most intimate thing two human beings can do together.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.160
Not watch the office.

19:01.160 --> 19:02.840
No, not go for a walk on the beach.

19:02.840 --> 19:04.960
It's the fundamental act that brings about the family,

19:04.960 --> 19:06.560
which brings about society.

19:06.560 --> 19:09.640
I'm of the opinion that if you pervert that fundamental I don't know why.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.640
It's why. Why is it perverted?

19:11.640 --> 19:15.880
Why is it because it usurps the natural end of sexual intercourse?

19:16.080 --> 19:19.720
If I eat food and then force myself to throw up, I'm usurping.

19:20.040 --> 19:22.920
OK, but I don't think that that it's a fair analogy.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.360
Let's say they look very fair.

19:24.360 --> 19:27.960
Let's say they looked at at bathing suit ads, not at Playboy.

19:28.960 --> 19:32.480
Just they looked at that other beautiful women together that that.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.600
And it was OK with my mother.

19:34.640 --> 19:37.640
Obviously, the assumption is it was OK with my mother.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.840
If it wasn't, then it's not a good thing. Clearly.

19:42.520 --> 19:48.240
I am more worried about men having to hide their nature.

19:48.840 --> 19:51.360
See, when you say God has built into their nature,

19:51.360 --> 19:54.560
a desire for variety, it sounds like you're saying that therefore

19:54.560 --> 19:57.000
it would be unnatural to not look at pornography.

19:57.400 --> 20:00.000
Well, forget the word pornography because it's so loaded.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.720
I'm anti pornography.

20:01.720 --> 20:04.760
But if pornography means anything that is arousing,

20:04.760 --> 20:06.600
then it could be a bra ad. Right.

20:06.600 --> 20:09.440
Well, I think I could define pornography like this.

20:09.440 --> 20:13.400
I could say material which depicts a rotec behavior.

20:13.400 --> 20:14.760
That's not behavior.

20:14.760 --> 20:16.920
There's no behavior in Playboy. OK.

20:17.120 --> 20:18.080
Well, it's not behavior.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.600
I think that's an important distinction.

20:19.600 --> 20:22.760
I think what when you say behavior, I think you're meaning video or.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.800
No, I didn't. That's why that's why I read.

20:26.040 --> 20:29.840
Then no, I don't I'm I am not

20:29.840 --> 20:33.720
advocate of watching sexual behavior, but I want to know what you mean

20:33.720 --> 20:36.200
by the word behavior, because if I'm going to say it's sexual,

20:36.200 --> 20:38.400
sexual activity between two people.

20:38.400 --> 20:41.680
OK, so even a photograph in Playboy of two people engaging in it.

20:41.680 --> 20:43.560
But there weren't such when I.

20:43.560 --> 20:45.320
That's when you were opposed to that,

20:45.320 --> 20:47.960
but you're OK with a man looking at one naked woman, let's say.

20:47.960 --> 20:50.160
Yes, or they weren't even naked then.

20:50.160 --> 20:52.760
They were covered in their privates.

20:52.760 --> 20:54.440
Right. But but you're opposed to them

20:54.480 --> 20:56.720
looking at anything that might be arousing.

20:56.720 --> 20:59.600
You're what if a woman is wearing a regular

21:00.280 --> 21:02.840
what if a man is turned on, which every man is,

21:03.000 --> 21:05.200
by an attractive woman in a nice dress?

21:05.480 --> 21:07.640
That's a turn on. So no, no, no, please answer.

21:07.920 --> 21:09.840
So is that bad?

21:09.840 --> 21:10.920
I'm going to add his wife.

21:10.920 --> 21:13.480
I'm going to answer, but let me unfold this a little bit.

21:13.920 --> 21:17.400
I think pornography can sometimes be a difficult thing to define.

21:17.600 --> 21:20.120
I would say, and let me see if I can redefine it for you,

21:20.280 --> 21:21.880
material that depicts

21:22.280 --> 21:28.520
something that's intended to sexually arouse or replace replace a prostitute.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.800
I mean, the word pornography comes from two Greek words,

21:30.800 --> 21:33.920
porne graph pain, which means the writing or the drawing of the prostitutes.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.600
It's meant to serve an erotic function.

21:37.200 --> 21:40.680
And so what if the but what if the eroticism is then is then.

21:40.680 --> 21:43.120
So I'm OK with the wife.

21:43.120 --> 21:46.520
I'm OK looking at breasts and I'm OK looking at bums.

21:47.080 --> 21:49.400
And I if you go to the Sistine Chapel,

21:49.480 --> 21:52.280
you'll see that Catholics are perfectly comfortable with nudity.

21:52.480 --> 21:55.640
But I think that nudity can be presented in a way

21:55.840 --> 21:58.440
that upholds and expresses the dignity of the person.

21:58.520 --> 22:02.240
So I could say, OK, I could look at that and marvel at God's creation

22:02.240 --> 22:04.320
and the beauty of woman and the beauty of man.

22:04.320 --> 22:07.680
But I think I could also look at a lingerie catalog

22:07.880 --> 22:11.600
and in my mind treat this person as a mere object.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.800
So I would say

22:14.320 --> 22:17.560
that in one aspect I'm OK looking at breasts, let's say, Sistine Chapel.

22:17.760 --> 22:20.880
But in another sense, if I'm looking at a lingerie catalog

22:20.880 --> 22:23.040
with the intention of lusting it, that wouldn't be OK.

22:23.040 --> 22:25.640
What if I'm looking at the lingerie catalog

22:25.640 --> 22:27.880
with the intention of getting my wife lingerie?

22:27.880 --> 22:30.640
I think the intention does matter. Yeah.

22:30.640 --> 22:31.520
OK. All right.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.440
Yeah. We're not that far.

22:33.440 --> 22:34.920
I'm not advocating this.

22:34.920 --> 22:35.680
I know you're not.

22:35.680 --> 22:36.920
And I really want that to get.

22:36.920 --> 22:38.960
Yeah, yes, it's very important.

22:38.960 --> 22:40.840
But I I'm so worried.

22:41.680 --> 22:45.520
Remember, I come from the woman calling my show.

22:45.960 --> 22:49.160
I saw I saw pictures on my husband's computer.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.600
I'm devastated.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.440
So what am I supposed to say?

22:52.440 --> 22:53.840
You know what?

22:53.840 --> 22:55.240
You're right to be devastated.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.040
Your husband is a real sinner.

22:57.040 --> 22:58.600
He treats you as an object.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.040
What would you like me to say to her?

23:00.040 --> 23:01.960
Here's what I'd like you to say.

23:01.960 --> 23:03.040
I think you could.

23:03.040 --> 23:05.120
I don't think you have to say.

23:06.280 --> 23:09.040
I think I would I think I would begin by validating her pain.

23:09.040 --> 23:10.560
I wouldn't dismiss it by.

23:10.560 --> 23:11.520
And I'm not saying you did this

23:11.520 --> 23:12.920
because I haven't heard this sort of phone call.

23:12.920 --> 23:14.200
But I wouldn't dismiss it by saying

23:14.200 --> 23:16.480
you're wrong to be hurt.

23:16.480 --> 23:19.720
I would say there are many things out there

23:19.720 --> 23:23.200
that your husband, I'm sure, loves you very much.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.880
Well, that's my first question to her.

23:24.880 --> 23:25.520
And you're right.

23:25.520 --> 23:27.760
This is does he love you and is he loving

23:27.760 --> 23:29.400
and do you have a good love life?

23:29.400 --> 23:29.960
And I yeah.

23:29.960 --> 23:32.400
And this is what I'll be if the answers are all.

23:32.400 --> 23:33.280
Yes, go on.

23:33.280 --> 23:34.760
So if the answers are all, yes, I would say, well,

23:34.760 --> 23:37.720
since he loves you and since this bothers you,

23:37.720 --> 23:39.720
there are some excellent resources

23:39.720 --> 23:41.680
that I'd love to tell you about

23:41.680 --> 23:43.800
that could help him be free of pornography.

23:43.840 --> 23:46.600
Because surely you would say if a man is looking at pornography

23:46.600 --> 23:48.720
and his wife's heartbroken, you're not saying, well,

23:48.720 --> 23:51.080
she's wrong to be and he doesn't need to change.

23:51.080 --> 23:53.200
If she's heartbroken, wouldn't you want to say to the man,

23:53.200 --> 23:54.760
here are some ways that you could quit?

23:54.760 --> 23:56.960
Yes, I would want to say to both of them.

23:58.880 --> 24:01.480
I understand why your heartbroken

24:01.480 --> 24:05.400
because you think that he loves her more than you

24:05.400 --> 24:06.760
or as much as you.

24:06.760 --> 24:09.160
And I want you to know that's not the case at all.

24:09.160 --> 24:11.480
I don't know if that's the only reason she'd be heartbroken.

24:11.480 --> 24:13.520
I don't think it's that she loves.

24:13.560 --> 24:17.480
I think that pornography trains us in selfishness.

24:17.480 --> 24:18.560
Yes, so.

24:18.560 --> 24:20.880
It also legitimizes.

24:20.880 --> 24:22.440
So a lot of he says to her, well, look,

24:22.440 --> 24:25.800
you saw lingerie ads and I'm dying to buy you

24:25.800 --> 24:29.120
some really cute lingerie.

24:29.120 --> 24:30.800
Would you be okay with that?

24:30.800 --> 24:33.080
I would say that we're verging on what's sometimes called

24:33.080 --> 24:34.520
the fallacy of the beard.

24:34.520 --> 24:35.640
You ever heard of this?

24:35.640 --> 24:37.880
Just because you don't know when something begins,

24:37.880 --> 24:40.240
it doesn't mean you can't say what a thing is.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.480
This isn't a beard.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.240
But in the three months, if I didn't shave,

24:43.240 --> 24:44.840
it would be and just because you don't know

24:44.840 --> 24:47.600
when it started doesn't mean you can't say what a beard is.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.880
And I would say that there are blurry lines.

24:49.880 --> 24:50.920
I would agree with you.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.920
Like a Victoria's Secret fashion show.

24:52.920 --> 24:53.760
Is that pornography?

24:53.760 --> 24:56.240
I'd say probably, what about,

24:56.240 --> 24:59.000
but is it less bad than other forms of pornography?

24:59.000 --> 24:59.840
Yes.

24:59.840 --> 25:01.480
Not all pornography is equal.

25:01.480 --> 25:03.800
Some pornography can be far more ratchet than others.

25:03.800 --> 25:05.440
We're really not that far apart.

25:05.880 --> 25:10.880
I, my biggest, one of my biggest teachings

25:13.360 --> 25:15.280
is that there are levels of sin

25:15.280 --> 25:17.520
and there are levels of good.

25:17.520 --> 25:21.360
And that we should not listen.

25:21.360 --> 25:23.240
I don't think this is not a Catholic thing,

25:23.240 --> 25:25.480
but many Protestants who listen to my show

25:26.480 --> 25:28.960
take issue with me when I say

25:28.960 --> 25:33.960
that God does not regard stealing a stapler from the office

25:34.520 --> 25:37.240
as he does child molestation.

25:37.240 --> 25:39.400
And they call me up and say, Dennis, love you,

25:39.400 --> 25:41.840
but I gotta tell you, a sin is a sin.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.360
Yeah, no, we would part ways with our...

25:44.360 --> 25:45.200
I know you would.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.040
Yes, I know.

25:46.040 --> 25:49.840
I said Catholics and Jews believe in gradations of sin.

25:49.840 --> 25:50.680
Correct, okay.

25:50.680 --> 25:53.640
So there are gradations in that arena as well.

25:53.640 --> 25:56.760
Yes, but I would say that just because something is less bad

25:56.760 --> 25:58.840
than something else, it doesn't make it good.

25:58.840 --> 25:59.680
So if you're saying to the...

25:59.680 --> 26:00.720
Okay, I'm not arguing it's good.

26:00.720 --> 26:01.560
So if you say to the...

26:01.560 --> 26:03.280
I'm arguing it's not as bad

26:03.560 --> 26:05.960
as people often make it out to be.

26:05.960 --> 26:07.840
I am not arguing that it's good.

26:09.160 --> 26:11.680
In an ideal marriage with my father,

26:11.680 --> 26:13.440
not have subscribed to Playboy,

26:13.440 --> 26:15.760
I'll be prepared to say yes, however.

26:15.760 --> 26:16.600
Look at you, good job.

26:16.600 --> 26:20.080
Yes, yeah, but it doesn't gain you as much as you think

26:20.080 --> 26:23.040
because I saw their relationship for seven,

26:23.040 --> 26:24.960
I didn't see it for 72 years, obviously,

26:24.960 --> 26:27.880
but I saw it for the bulk of their life.

26:27.880 --> 26:31.800
And the respect with which he treated her.

26:31.800 --> 26:32.640
I'm sure he did.

26:32.640 --> 26:34.200
I'm not making the claim that you have

26:34.200 --> 26:37.200
pure pristine holy marriage and haven of filth.

26:37.200 --> 26:39.040
I'm not saying that those are only two options.

26:39.040 --> 26:41.080
Right, okay, so fine, so there are degrees.

26:41.080 --> 26:43.040
But if you're saying to the woman,

26:43.040 --> 26:46.200
better for him to look at porn than to commit adultery,

26:46.200 --> 26:48.000
then what I would say there is,

26:48.000 --> 26:50.920
it might be less bad, all things being equal,

26:50.920 --> 26:52.800
but less bad doesn't make it good.

26:52.800 --> 26:54.960
And if adultery can be analogized

26:54.960 --> 26:57.000
to shooting your marriage in the head,

26:57.000 --> 26:59.480
I would say pornography is the slow poisoning of it

26:59.480 --> 27:01.840
and that there's a great deal of research

27:01.840 --> 27:03.720
to be able to back that up.

27:03.720 --> 27:04.840
Yes, well.

27:04.840 --> 27:08.080
In fact, Dennis, I'm gonna get your book on Exodus.

27:08.080 --> 27:09.840
I promise to look at it.

27:09.840 --> 27:11.280
This is my book on pornography.

27:11.280 --> 27:14.040
It's a non-religious response to pro-porn arguments.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.200
Oh yeah, I'll be very happy to read it.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.720
And I'll sign it so it'll be worth more

27:16.720 --> 27:18.680
in the garage sale one day.

27:18.680 --> 27:21.840
But there's no talk of sin, there's no scripture verses.

27:21.840 --> 27:24.920
It's all based on the 40 plus years of science

27:24.920 --> 27:27.400
that's coming out of academia from neuroscience.

27:27.400 --> 27:28.640
So here's the question.

27:28.640 --> 27:31.160
Okay, so you see, the reason I actually

27:31.160 --> 27:32.480
never talk about pornography.

27:32.480 --> 27:33.920
He asked me, you were asked me.

27:33.920 --> 27:34.760
This is your news.

27:34.760 --> 27:36.840
I never do, I certainly don't advocate it.

27:37.920 --> 27:40.880
I don't even discuss it, let alone advocate it.

27:40.880 --> 27:45.240
But it was asked, and I sort of took a vow many years ago,

27:45.240 --> 27:46.960
I won't avoid questions.

27:46.960 --> 27:49.640
I wish I had known in advance it would be discussed.

27:49.640 --> 27:51.920
I would have said how much I'm horrified

27:51.920 --> 27:54.160
by the pornification of society, et cetera.

27:55.040 --> 28:00.040
But we, I want to, we're on so many different,

28:02.800 --> 28:04.440
related but different tracks.

28:04.440 --> 28:06.520
And it's a very important subject.

28:13.880 --> 28:17.840
Oh yes, I was influenced by my parents' marriage.

28:17.840 --> 28:19.760
We're all influenced by our parents' marriage.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.440
If you see your father beat your mother,

28:21.440 --> 28:24.120
you think that's normal and you end up beating your wife.

28:24.360 --> 28:25.560
Of course, my father, I mean,

28:25.560 --> 28:27.440
the thought that he would ever lift it,

28:27.440 --> 28:30.360
he wouldn't, it's so inconceivable to me.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.720
All he did was tell his sons

28:32.720 --> 28:34.640
how much he loved their mother.

28:34.640 --> 28:35.880
I mean, constantly.

28:37.200 --> 28:40.480
So what I saw was a man got Playboy

28:40.480 --> 28:43.920
and loved his wife for 72 years.

28:43.920 --> 28:47.120
She knew he got Playboy and loved her husband

28:47.120 --> 28:49.600
and knew he loved her for 72 years.

28:49.600 --> 28:52.680
So that's what I saw.

28:52.720 --> 28:56.440
And I'm not going to sit here as their child

28:56.440 --> 28:59.920
and say, this was really awful.

28:59.920 --> 29:03.560
When I can't say it because I would be lying.

29:03.560 --> 29:06.280
But if you ask me, is there an ideal?

29:06.280 --> 29:09.080
I will argue, okay, there is an ideal.

29:09.080 --> 29:13.200
But the human condition is messy.

29:13.200 --> 29:18.200
So back to our earlier question,

29:18.480 --> 29:21.800
where we differ on can a loving husband

29:21.840 --> 29:26.840
in the bedroom ever see his wife as a sex object?

29:27.520 --> 29:29.680
And I said, that's good.

29:29.680 --> 29:30.800
See, that's there.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.760
Finally, we have a real difference.

29:32.760 --> 29:34.600
I actually think that is a positive.

29:34.600 --> 29:37.680
I don't know if we do have a disagreement.

29:37.680 --> 29:39.520
If by sex object, you mean

29:39.520 --> 29:41.600
you find your wife sexually desirable.

29:41.600 --> 29:43.520
I don't know what the difference is.

29:43.520 --> 29:44.360
What's the difference?

29:44.360 --> 29:45.560
I think this is what I would say, right?

29:45.560 --> 29:48.200
As subject, like man is made

29:48.200 --> 29:50.720
and man makes his own ends, right?

29:50.760 --> 29:52.840
Slavery is wrong because we take a man

29:52.840 --> 29:56.360
who makes his own ends and would like to fulfill them.

29:58.040 --> 29:59.720
When I talk about objectification,

29:59.720 --> 30:02.000
I guess I'm talking about a sort of evacuation

30:02.000 --> 30:04.440
of the subject of the person.

30:04.440 --> 30:05.840
I'm not concerned about her.

30:05.840 --> 30:07.680
I'm not concerned about her.

30:07.680 --> 30:10.000
You draw an inference that I'm not implying.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.400
And that's why I say I don't know if we're disagreeing.

30:12.400 --> 30:13.240
We may not.

30:13.240 --> 30:14.360
That would be great to resolve it.

30:14.360 --> 30:16.800
I'm totally happy with that if that happens.

30:17.640 --> 30:22.640
How you treat her is not that you will treat her badly.

30:24.760 --> 30:28.800
The moment women don't say I'm crazy

30:28.800 --> 30:31.360
about my husband's legs, okay?

30:31.360 --> 30:33.920
But a man may not say it.

30:33.920 --> 30:34.760
Well, that's true.

30:34.760 --> 30:35.760
Fair enough.

30:35.760 --> 30:40.680
Okay, I'll ask your wife, okay.

30:41.640 --> 30:46.640
But every man thinks that way

30:46.840 --> 30:48.560
if there's a part of her body

30:48.560 --> 30:51.840
that is particularly a turn on to use the term do him.

30:51.840 --> 30:53.520
That is objectification.

30:53.520 --> 30:55.080
Women don't do that.

30:55.080 --> 30:58.240
Women don't, very, I mean, young women do.

30:58.240 --> 30:59.600
Oh, he's got a great butt.

30:59.600 --> 31:02.040
By objectification, do you mean I find a part

31:02.040 --> 31:04.800
of my wife's body that I find attractive sexually?

31:04.800 --> 31:05.640
Yeah.

31:05.640 --> 31:06.480
Yeah, all right.

31:06.480 --> 31:09.800
I suppose that for me, objectification means

31:11.320 --> 31:14.200
sort of subordinating the good of my wife

31:14.200 --> 31:15.520
to a selfish pleasure.

31:15.520 --> 31:20.360
You have drawn a behavioral inference from a thought

31:20.360 --> 31:21.200
and I don't.

31:21.200 --> 31:22.040
Yeah.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.640
But see, I still am not convinced

31:23.640 --> 31:27.080
that this sharp distinction or the distinction,

31:27.080 --> 31:29.120
because I've heard Ben Shapiro say something similar.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.680
And so I don't know if this is,

31:30.680 --> 31:33.320
as you say, more of a behaviorist, kind of Jewish idea,

31:33.320 --> 31:34.320
because I think he said something like,

31:34.320 --> 31:36.200
I don't really care if you have racist thoughts.

31:36.200 --> 31:37.240
I care about how you act.

31:37.240 --> 31:38.080
That's right.

31:38.080 --> 31:39.080
I said that to the group tonight.

31:39.080 --> 31:40.640
I don't care if people dislike Jews.

31:40.640 --> 31:41.680
I care how they treat us.

31:41.680 --> 31:42.880
But if my son or daughter.

31:42.880 --> 31:43.840
I know you're right.

31:43.840 --> 31:45.640
I would tell the same to my child.

31:45.640 --> 31:47.760
If my child said, I don't like this group.

31:47.760 --> 31:50.880
But I think this is what our Lord Jesus Christ is doing,

31:50.880 --> 31:52.840
in which he's saying your righteousness

31:52.840 --> 31:54.760
has to pass out of the Pharisees.

31:54.760 --> 31:59.760
It's not enough that you don't murder.

32:00.360 --> 32:01.720
You should not want to.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.800
It's not enough that you don't commit adultery.

32:03.800 --> 32:06.880
You should not say fuel the flame

32:06.880 --> 32:08.840
that could lead to that.

32:08.840 --> 32:10.320
I happen to think it's a good thing

32:10.320 --> 32:11.200
not to want to murder.

32:11.200 --> 32:12.680
I subscribe to that.

32:14.080 --> 32:17.920
But there's a very interesting Hebrew phrase

32:18.920 --> 32:20.160
translating from the Hebrew.

32:20.160 --> 32:22.160
So it'll be a bit awkward.

32:22.160 --> 32:26.160
In the place that a penitent stands,

32:26.160 --> 32:28.960
the most righteous person doesn't stand.

32:28.960 --> 32:31.920
And I extrapolate from that,

32:31.920 --> 32:36.920
that if you have bad thoughts and don't act on them,

32:37.460 --> 32:39.200
you're on a higher moral plane

32:39.200 --> 32:41.240
than the guy who never has a bad thought.

32:41.240 --> 32:44.000
I don't get any credit for not molesting children.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.280
I'm as interested in children sexually

32:46.280 --> 32:49.320
as I am in bananas or peach trees.

32:50.680 --> 32:53.600
So I get no credit for not molesting a child.

32:53.600 --> 32:57.280
But the sick dude who does want to and doesn't,

32:57.280 --> 32:58.840
he gets a lot of credit.

32:58.840 --> 33:01.120
So speaking of pedophilia,

33:01.960 --> 33:06.960
suppose a man says, I view animated child porn.

33:07.960 --> 33:11.320
So there's no real victim in that sense of child pornography,

33:11.320 --> 33:12.960
which we both agree is horrendous.

33:12.960 --> 33:15.360
And by viewing animated child porn,

33:15.360 --> 33:18.040
it prevents me from acting out sexually on a child.

33:18.040 --> 33:19.480
Now, I deny that.

33:19.480 --> 33:22.240
I think that pornography inflames us

33:22.240 --> 33:24.120
to then want to act those fantasies out.

33:24.120 --> 33:26.280
And I think there's good studies that back that up.

33:26.280 --> 33:28.200
But surely you wouldn't say to the man

33:28.200 --> 33:30.480
who views animated child pornography,

33:30.480 --> 33:33.040
that's not bad so long as you don't act it out.

33:33.040 --> 33:35.120
Wouldn't you want to help this poor sick dude?

33:35.240 --> 33:36.360
Yes, I would.

33:36.360 --> 33:38.640
But I am thrilled that he's not acting it out.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.080
I mean, of course.

33:40.080 --> 33:41.480
Well, that's big.

33:41.480 --> 33:46.480
We're both thrilled that he might have a poor substitute,

33:46.480 --> 33:49.560
but it is a substitute if that were the case.

33:49.560 --> 33:51.320
No child is being used.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.840
It's all animated.

33:53.840 --> 33:55.600
And he-

33:55.600 --> 33:57.360
But would you use the word evil

33:57.360 --> 33:58.720
of animated child pornography?

33:58.720 --> 34:00.000
Because I certainly would.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.280
No, I would use evil only with behavior.

34:02.280 --> 34:05.400
That's where we might differ from forgetting the sex issue.

34:05.400 --> 34:07.240
You can't be evil.

34:07.240 --> 34:09.360
You didn't do evil if you thought evil.

34:09.360 --> 34:10.200
You did evil if you committed-

34:10.200 --> 34:11.960
If I'm masturbating to animated pictures of pornography,

34:11.960 --> 34:12.960
I'm not doing something evil.

34:12.960 --> 34:13.800
That's correct.

34:13.800 --> 34:16.000
Yeah, I think that's despicable.

34:16.000 --> 34:16.840
Yeah.

34:16.840 --> 34:17.680
Really?

34:17.680 --> 34:18.600
Yes, of course.

34:18.600 --> 34:19.440
Who is being hurt?

34:19.440 --> 34:20.600
You have to have a victim.

34:20.600 --> 34:23.000
Oh, I'll tell you, there's at least two people being hurt.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.160
There's the person who's poisoning himself

34:25.160 --> 34:26.440
by encouraging him to think-

34:26.440 --> 34:27.280
Yes, yes, you're right.

34:27.280 --> 34:28.120
Acting out on children.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.600
And there's also the animator-

34:29.600 --> 34:30.440
Okay, wait a minute.

34:30.520 --> 34:34.640
We both are aching for him not to have those fantasies.

34:34.640 --> 34:36.080
I agree with you, but I-

34:36.080 --> 34:37.040
But you won't call it evil.

34:37.040 --> 34:38.880
I won't call a fantasy evil.

34:40.080 --> 34:42.240
There's too much real evil on earth

34:42.240 --> 34:45.840
for me to start being preoccupied with people's thinking.

34:45.840 --> 34:46.840
It's not just thinking.

34:46.840 --> 34:48.280
It's him masturbating to-

34:48.280 --> 34:49.120
Yes, he's okay.

34:49.120 --> 34:53.080
Okay, so the real question about the whole pornography issue

34:53.080 --> 34:55.880
is not pornography, it's masturbation.

34:55.880 --> 34:57.280
There was a Catholic tradition-

34:57.280 --> 34:58.120
I disagree.

34:58.120 --> 34:59.480
I think it's both.

34:59.520 --> 35:00.960
I think both masturbation is evil,

35:00.960 --> 35:02.280
but I think pornography is a greater evil, I would say.

35:02.280 --> 35:03.880
Okay, so I don't think masturbation is evil.

35:03.880 --> 35:05.880
Okay, that's, and by the way,

35:05.880 --> 35:08.080
I admit that within Orthodox Judaism,

35:08.080 --> 35:12.320
there is, when I was a counselor at Orthodox Jewish camp,

35:12.320 --> 35:14.480
the kids were told by some of their rabbis

35:14.480 --> 35:17.000
that masturbation is like murder.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.560
And there was that, there was also that.

35:19.560 --> 35:20.680
There's a statement like that.

35:20.680 --> 35:21.880
I certainly wouldn't make that statement.

35:21.880 --> 35:24.560
Okay, I do believe that in Catholic theology,

35:24.560 --> 35:25.400
there is-

35:25.400 --> 35:26.720
No, no, no.

35:26.720 --> 35:28.120
No Catholic is saying that murder

35:28.120 --> 35:30.160
is equivalent to masturbation.

35:30.160 --> 35:31.000
Okay, all right, good.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.640
You might say that both are grave sins,

35:32.640 --> 35:35.120
but you wouldn't say that masturbation is a graver sin.

35:35.120 --> 35:36.080
Even within murder,

35:36.080 --> 35:37.600
patricide would be a graver sin

35:37.600 --> 35:38.440
than killing a stranger.

35:38.440 --> 35:40.960
So since we both believe murder is always wrong,

35:40.960 --> 35:42.840
obviously self-defense is killing not murder,

35:42.840 --> 35:44.760
so murder is always wrong.

35:44.760 --> 35:46.760
Child molestation is always wrong.

35:46.760 --> 35:48.720
Is masturbation always wrong?

35:48.720 --> 35:52.360
What about a man whose wife, and I had this example,

35:52.360 --> 35:54.560
now you may say, well, if you take an extreme example,

35:54.560 --> 35:55.760
it's not fair.

35:55.800 --> 35:57.600
But if you say always,

35:57.600 --> 36:00.760
I have to take a real life example of a man I knew

36:00.760 --> 36:03.520
who adored his wife.

36:03.520 --> 36:05.280
I knew them when they were both Welsh.

36:05.280 --> 36:08.520
She got Alzheimer's at a very early age in her 50s,

36:08.520 --> 36:10.840
and he dressed her and bathed her

36:10.840 --> 36:13.880
and cleaned her up for a decade.

36:13.880 --> 36:18.880
And if this man, with a wife who no longer recognized him,

36:19.080 --> 36:21.680
masturbated to get rid of his sexual tension

36:21.680 --> 36:24.920
and stayed to take care of his wife,

36:25.920 --> 36:27.200
you would say that was evil?

36:27.200 --> 36:29.080
I would, because I think that evil

36:29.080 --> 36:31.000
is the way things shouldn't be.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
And I think the sexual act exists for union,

36:34.000 --> 36:38.320
and to masturbate is to thwart the end of that natural act.

36:38.320 --> 36:42.000
I also think that what we haven't taken into account yet

36:42.000 --> 36:44.400
is an industry that brutalizes women

36:44.400 --> 36:46.160
that's often involved in trafficking women.

36:46.160 --> 36:48.040
Oh, that's why I said, I've against all of that.

36:48.040 --> 36:50.080
I'm on your side on that.

36:50.080 --> 36:52.280
Yes, I was talking about pictures,

36:52.280 --> 36:53.920
still pictures of models.

36:54.720 --> 36:56.760
But I'm still saying that this brutalizes women.

36:56.760 --> 37:00.040
I think it's like, what woman would you like him to look at?

37:00.040 --> 37:03.120
Like your wife, your daughter, my daughter?

37:03.120 --> 37:05.320
Would you be comfortable with someone you know and love

37:05.320 --> 37:06.920
being looked at like that?

37:06.920 --> 37:10.040
I wouldn't. No, but it's, you're using,

37:11.840 --> 37:16.080
you're bringing the emotional.

37:16.080 --> 37:17.400
I would say you're doing that.

37:17.400 --> 37:20.160
I think you're doing that when you use this story.

37:20.160 --> 37:22.120
I would not deny that this is a virtuous man

37:22.160 --> 37:23.680
in many respects, laudable,

37:23.680 --> 37:24.920
who I could learn a great deal from.

37:24.920 --> 37:26.520
Right, but no, no, you use the word evil.

37:26.520 --> 37:27.360
That's right. That's right.

37:27.360 --> 37:29.440
Okay, you define evil in a way I don't.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.160
The way things shouldn't be, I would say.

37:31.160 --> 37:33.560
And I would refer to natural evil.

37:33.560 --> 37:36.240
So if a man is born blind, this is a natural evil.

37:36.240 --> 37:38.800
If a stone is blind, this is not a natural evil.

37:38.800 --> 37:40.800
But I would also refer to moral evil

37:40.800 --> 37:42.480
as this is the way things shouldn't be.

37:42.480 --> 37:44.200
So we disagree on that.

37:44.200 --> 37:49.200
Yes, so I'm trying to think of, okay,

37:50.200 --> 37:53.440
is it, it shouldn't be that kids spend as much time

37:53.440 --> 37:56.320
as they do on social media.

37:56.320 --> 37:59.000
Do we both agree with that, that they spend too much time?

37:59.000 --> 38:00.520
Yes. Would you call it evil

38:00.520 --> 38:02.440
if they did spend too much time?

38:02.440 --> 38:03.440
Probably yes.

38:03.440 --> 38:05.800
Okay, I wouldn't say it was wrong,

38:05.800 --> 38:07.160
but I wouldn't say it was evil.

38:07.160 --> 38:10.160
So I've shared with you how I define evil.

38:10.160 --> 38:11.000
How do you define it?

38:11.000 --> 38:13.200
Is the deliberate infliction of hurt

38:13.200 --> 38:15.000
on another human being?

38:15.000 --> 38:17.480
So I would say that pornography involves

38:17.520 --> 38:21.040
the deliberate infliction of hurt on another human being

38:21.040 --> 38:24.040
through the photographing of a person.

38:24.040 --> 38:27.960
So that would include lingerie models.

38:27.960 --> 38:30.080
Again, I'm not sure.

38:30.080 --> 38:31.760
I don't have a, I don't know.

38:31.760 --> 38:34.440
Men are as capable of masturbating to lingerie models

38:34.440 --> 38:36.040
as they are to awful stuff.

38:36.040 --> 38:38.080
Right. So what I think the goal should be

38:38.080 --> 38:42.040
is to line up the goal of the artist or the photographer

38:42.040 --> 38:44.760
and the goal and the intention of the viewer

38:44.760 --> 38:46.600
with the dignity of the human person.

38:46.680 --> 38:49.000
Because I can view something non-pornographic

38:49.000 --> 38:50.520
and say masturbate to it.

38:50.520 --> 38:51.360
Right.

38:51.360 --> 38:52.480
The problem isn't with the thing I'm looking at.

38:52.480 --> 38:53.760
The problem's with me.

38:53.760 --> 38:55.320
Likewise, likewise,

38:55.320 --> 38:58.320
I could look through a pornographic magazine

38:58.320 --> 39:00.160
and feel nothing but pity

39:00.160 --> 39:01.920
for these women who don't know their dignity.

39:01.920 --> 39:04.040
In that case, objectively, it's photography,

39:04.040 --> 39:05.640
but subjectively, it isn't for me.

39:05.640 --> 39:07.200
So I think you want both to line up

39:07.200 --> 39:08.680
with the dignity of the human person

39:08.680 --> 39:09.520
created in the image.

39:09.520 --> 39:12.640
Wanting to line up with dignity is totally admirable.

39:12.640 --> 39:17.040
Calling the non-lining up is a lingerie model

39:17.040 --> 39:18.240
losing her dignity.

39:18.240 --> 39:19.280
And you may say yes.

39:19.280 --> 39:20.360
Yeah, I think I would say yes.

39:20.360 --> 39:21.200
Yeah, okay.

39:21.200 --> 39:22.040
Yeah.

39:22.040 --> 39:24.200
But again, I want to make a huge distinction

39:24.200 --> 39:25.480
between these gradations.

39:25.480 --> 39:26.320
Well, and so do I.

39:26.320 --> 39:29.200
Something can be far less bad than synchronous.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.480
When people say pornography,

39:30.480 --> 39:34.280
they're thinking of the most awful behaviors.

39:34.280 --> 39:35.360
Well, let me ask you this then,

39:35.360 --> 39:36.440
because it sounded like you were saying

39:36.440 --> 39:37.880
that if a man views pornography

39:37.880 --> 39:40.480
and thereby doesn't commit adultery, it's okay.

39:40.480 --> 39:41.520
No, I didn't say okay.

39:41.520 --> 39:42.600
I said it wasn't awful.

39:42.600 --> 39:43.440
Not horrible, fair enough.

39:43.440 --> 39:44.280
Right.

39:44.280 --> 39:45.120
Thank you for the correction.

39:45.120 --> 39:45.960
Yeah.

39:45.960 --> 39:48.880
But you've also said that you're very much opposed

39:48.880 --> 39:52.960
to violent pornography, obviously.

39:52.960 --> 39:55.840
If a man says I need to watch violent pornography

39:55.840 --> 39:57.800
so I don't commit adultery, do you say,

39:57.800 --> 39:59.840
well, okay, that's less bad too?

39:59.840 --> 40:03.040
Or do you condemn that with a greater severity?

40:03.040 --> 40:05.680
Well, because the odds are

40:05.680 --> 40:08.760
that the people in it are being hurt.

40:08.760 --> 40:10.160
What if they're willing to be hurt?

40:10.160 --> 40:11.000
What if they enjoy being hurt?

40:11.360 --> 40:15.280
So then I more or less subscribe to your vision

40:15.280 --> 40:16.600
of the issue.

40:16.600 --> 40:20.360
But again, I want to remind everybody watching or listening

40:20.360 --> 40:25.360
that my vision was of Playboy of the 1960s

40:25.580 --> 40:27.000
when I was a teenager,

40:28.320 --> 40:33.240
which would be regarded today as...

40:33.240 --> 40:34.600
Not even worthy of Netflix.

40:34.600 --> 40:36.160
I mean, what we once called hardcore,

40:36.160 --> 40:37.000
we now call softcore.

40:37.000 --> 40:37.840
Yes, okay.

40:37.840 --> 40:40.000
But we once called softcore, we now call Netflix.

40:40.000 --> 40:45.000
But I have to ask you and many others

40:45.720 --> 40:47.760
who feel as you do, and I respect it,

40:50.800 --> 40:52.440
is everything...

40:53.880 --> 40:55.680
Well, I did ask you.

40:55.680 --> 40:58.240
I mean, once you say masturbation

40:58.240 --> 41:00.680
under all circumstances is evil,

41:00.680 --> 41:03.200
that I will admit we part company.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.040
Yeah.

41:04.040 --> 41:04.880
And that's fine.

41:04.880 --> 41:05.720
I mean, we knew we would disagree.

41:05.720 --> 41:06.560
Yes, that's fine.

41:06.560 --> 41:08.720
And there's also a lot of things we agree about.

41:09.560 --> 41:12.200
There was one, I don't want to say his name

41:12.200 --> 41:13.480
because I may be wrong,

41:13.480 --> 41:18.480
but I believe there was one major evangelical leader,

41:19.080 --> 41:20.400
I mean, major.

41:20.400 --> 41:22.280
He was a household name for a while.

41:22.280 --> 41:23.400
Dobson, I think.

41:23.400 --> 41:25.560
Oh, so you didn't know what I'm referring to.

41:25.560 --> 41:27.520
I don't want to misspeak here.

41:27.520 --> 41:28.840
Maybe Thursday you can look this up,

41:28.840 --> 41:31.880
but I believe Dobson at one point justified masturbation

41:31.880 --> 41:33.520
in certain circumstances.

41:33.520 --> 41:34.960
See, what I respect about you

41:34.960 --> 41:37.320
and what I respect about Jordan Peterson

41:37.320 --> 41:39.800
is that very often you tell us to take the hard road.

41:39.800 --> 41:42.040
You're like, yes, it's bloody hard, but be a man.

41:42.040 --> 41:43.960
Like rise up, choose the harder path.

41:43.960 --> 41:45.520
Choose the more virtuous path.

41:45.520 --> 41:48.960
I just wish that you or Peterson would be more emphatic

41:48.960 --> 41:50.440
when it comes to sexual sins

41:50.440 --> 41:52.000
that of course you're tempted to it.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.240
Of course you want to do it.

41:53.240 --> 41:56.200
What's interesting isn't why people masturbate to pornography.

41:56.200 --> 41:57.480
That's obvious.

41:57.480 --> 41:59.720
What's interesting is why people decide they don't want to.

41:59.720 --> 42:01.600
Well, again, why not encourage them?

42:01.600 --> 42:03.720
Don't throw in the word pornography.

42:03.720 --> 42:06.480
Masturbate alone is a sin to you and evil.

42:06.640 --> 42:09.840
What if he's masturbating to an image he makes up in his brain?

42:09.840 --> 42:12.080
If he's masturbating to nothing, I would consider it an evil.

42:12.080 --> 42:12.720
Okay, fair.

42:12.720 --> 42:13.320
Okay.

42:13.320 --> 42:14.040
Yeah.

42:14.040 --> 42:16.040
It's...

42:16.040 --> 42:16.640
Dobson?

42:16.640 --> 42:20.880
Dr. James Dobson in about 1987,

42:20.880 --> 42:22.400
the quote appears to be,

42:22.400 --> 42:26.120
it is my opinion that masturbation is not much of an issue with God.

42:26.120 --> 42:28.000
It's a normal part of adolescence.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.560
Indeed, Jesus did not mention it.

42:30.560 --> 42:31.920
Jesus didn't mention a lot of things.

42:31.920 --> 42:34.000
Well, yeah, but well, it's not insignificant,

42:34.000 --> 42:35.920
nor does the Hebrew Bible talk about it.

42:35.920 --> 42:39.760
The spilling of seed with Onan, from which we get Onanism,

42:39.760 --> 42:42.080
the sin was not that he spilled the seed.

42:42.080 --> 42:47.440
The sin was that he didn't have intercourse with his brother's widow.

42:48.080 --> 42:51.760
So, I mean, the Catholic would say that reason would show us

42:51.760 --> 42:55.280
that masturbation is disordered, that pornography is disordered,

42:55.280 --> 42:58.080
because it takes a natural act, which is good,

42:58.080 --> 42:59.440
and it thwarts the end of it.

42:59.440 --> 43:01.040
That's why I use the example of...

43:01.040 --> 43:03.280
What about a man who can't attract a woman?

43:04.240 --> 43:07.360
He should spend his life, obviously, then.

43:07.360 --> 43:09.680
Yes, because masturbation is not like urination.

43:09.680 --> 43:10.960
It's not something you need to do,

43:10.960 --> 43:13.840
or else you're going to become neurotic and die somehow.

43:13.840 --> 43:15.280
You're not going to find anybody in the morgue

43:15.280 --> 43:17.760
with a tag on their toe that says virgin or something.

43:19.680 --> 43:22.160
I think it's a pornified culture that's given us this idea.

43:22.160 --> 43:25.840
Let me say that the ideal life would involve none of this.

43:25.840 --> 43:28.560
I am not preoccupied with the ideal life.

43:28.560 --> 43:30.880
I am preoccupied with a good life.

43:30.960 --> 43:34.880
As I often say, I am not interested in making saints.

43:34.880 --> 43:36.720
I am interested in making good people.

43:37.360 --> 43:42.640
And it is so hard to make good people in a post-communist,

43:42.640 --> 43:45.520
post-Nazi world, post-Islamic...

43:45.520 --> 43:47.760
It's not post yet, Islamic terrorist world.

43:48.560 --> 43:52.080
I admit, I am preoccupied with real evil

43:52.720 --> 43:55.680
rather than non-idyllic behavior.

43:55.680 --> 43:58.080
I admit it. That's where I am...

43:58.080 --> 44:02.240
And maybe to clarify my thought, which might make it more acceptable to you,

44:02.240 --> 44:04.800
I would say that there are circumstances in which

44:05.680 --> 44:08.000
masturbating or even looking at pornography

44:08.000 --> 44:13.360
could be a less grave sin due to habit, due to immaturity.

44:13.360 --> 44:16.720
But see, even in secular culture, we make fun of masturbation.

44:17.520 --> 44:19.920
We don't seem to be proud of masturbation.

44:19.920 --> 44:24.080
Even atheists, there's this big move to stop being a cream puff

44:24.080 --> 44:25.440
and masturbating into a sock.

44:25.440 --> 44:28.640
And instead of that, control your sexual desire.

44:28.640 --> 44:31.600
You're not a dog to be neutered.

44:31.600 --> 44:34.320
You're someone who has mastery over your lower passions.

44:34.320 --> 44:36.080
So I have a desire for food.

44:36.080 --> 44:38.800
But if I eat like a pig, then this is going to be bad for my health

44:38.800 --> 44:40.560
and this would be the sin of gluttony.

44:40.560 --> 44:41.840
I could have the desire to masturbate.

44:41.840 --> 44:43.600
But the difference is you can eat.

44:45.120 --> 44:46.880
The man who cannot have any sex.

44:46.880 --> 44:50.400
No, you're equating orgasm with eating and it's not the same thing.

44:50.400 --> 44:51.200
You did.

44:51.200 --> 44:55.680
No, you're saying that I'm equating them to show that they're dissimilar

44:55.680 --> 44:57.680
in that if I don't eat, I die.

44:58.400 --> 45:00.160
But it sounds like what you're saying is, well,

45:00.160 --> 45:01.520
but the man who never has a woman,

45:01.520 --> 45:03.600
surely he should masturbate or else what?

45:03.600 --> 45:04.880
And I'm saying he's not going to die.

45:05.440 --> 45:06.720
He's not going to die.

45:06.720 --> 45:06.960
Right.

45:06.960 --> 45:10.160
And so I think the man should have mastery over that passion

45:10.160 --> 45:11.760
and use it appropriately.

45:11.760 --> 45:12.960
That's what I would say.

45:12.960 --> 45:15.920
Okay. Ideally, I agree with you.

45:15.920 --> 45:18.240
So one way that's important that I said that.

45:18.800 --> 45:20.720
Ideally, ideally, ideally.

45:21.280 --> 45:25.040
But as I said, like in the case of marriages,

45:25.040 --> 45:26.400
I want them to love each other.

45:27.520 --> 45:33.920
And by the way, let me just, this is not utterly germane to our debate here.

45:34.560 --> 45:40.160
But having spoken to so many couples for so many years,

45:41.840 --> 45:46.560
I have a phrase which is related to this.

45:47.520 --> 45:49.840
But not exactly this, but related.

45:50.480 --> 45:52.800
You should make love outside the bedroom

45:52.800 --> 45:54.560
and have sex inside the bedroom.

45:56.080 --> 45:56.640
I love it.

45:57.280 --> 45:58.240
But I think I know what you mean.

45:58.240 --> 46:00.160
Oh, I'm glad you love it.

46:00.160 --> 46:02.240
Well, it's if I'm ignoring my wife,

46:02.880 --> 46:06.640
if I'm not doing acts of kindness towards her throughout the day,

46:07.760 --> 46:11.040
then to expect to come together and be intimate

46:11.040 --> 46:14.240
in that most intimate of embraces is selfish.

46:14.960 --> 46:18.320
But I want to love my bride throughout the day, sacrifice for her.

46:18.320 --> 46:21.040
Right. But what I'm saying more than that.

46:21.040 --> 46:21.600
Okay.

46:21.600 --> 46:24.160
That, of course, I'm saying that, but I am saying more than that.

46:24.720 --> 46:34.240
I'm also saying that the bedroom might be a place for the non-holy to express itself.

46:34.240 --> 46:37.840
Because we, I believe, were created in God's image and animal's image.

46:37.840 --> 46:43.040
And if we, sex allows the animal under holy circumstances,

46:43.040 --> 46:45.600
which is matrimony for both Jews and Catholics,

46:46.480 --> 46:52.240
that the word for marriage in Hebrew, kiddushin, means holy.

46:52.240 --> 46:56.800
I mean, that is the whole Talmudic volumes on marriage.

46:56.800 --> 47:01.040
And sex is called kiddushin, which means kadoches.

47:01.040 --> 47:02.720
Many Catholics know it means holy.

47:04.000 --> 47:10.560
So I Schmuley Boteath is a bearded Orthodox rabbi.

47:10.560 --> 47:11.920
I don't know if you're familiar with him.

47:12.400 --> 47:14.800
And he wrote a book called Kosher Sex.

47:15.520 --> 47:17.200
His argument is as follows.

47:18.080 --> 47:21.040
And he's very anti-porn, very.

47:22.560 --> 47:30.800
His argument is anything that the couple, the married couple agrees to in the bedroom,

47:31.680 --> 47:34.320
they should do, that that's the place.

47:34.320 --> 47:36.480
And that's why he calls it Kosher Sex.

47:36.480 --> 47:41.600
It wasn't, by the way, universally received well among some religious Jews.

47:42.080 --> 47:47.360
I, your views are not all that different from many Orthodox Jews.

47:47.360 --> 47:48.720
Why was he opposed to pornography?

47:50.240 --> 47:51.440
For the same reasons you are.
