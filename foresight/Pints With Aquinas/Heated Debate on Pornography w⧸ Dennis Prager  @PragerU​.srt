1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
Let's talk about the pornography thing.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,080
Right.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,080
Well, that was...

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,240
How did that go when you discussed it with Father Dave?

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,680
Well, you'll have to ask the people there.

6
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,920
I mean, I can only judge it from my perspective.

7
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,680
I thought it went terrific.

8
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,680
When I saw that clip of you in Exodus, I got the sense that you were a bit sidelined.

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,680
Or totally.

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,280
And if somebody who has a talk show, I wish that I could go back and rephrase things or

11
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,280
add some new ones to...

12
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,280
Well, that's correct.

13
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,280
That is exactly how I wrote a letter.

14
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,280
I hope you saw it.

15
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:33,380
It was the last thing I imagined being asked at an Exodus course with Jordan Peterson

16
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:38,160
and a bunch of scholars whom I adored, by the way.

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,880
Nevertheless, I should have...

18
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,040
I wish I had phrased it better.

19
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:52,920
It is what it is, and I phrased it better tonight without being untrue to myself.

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:59,520
And what I did not see, a big part of the problem, should I review this for your watchers,

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,520
listeners?

22
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,520
Review?

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,000
Review what happened so that they'll understand what we're talking about.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,720
So I...

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,760
The Daily Wire asked me to join Jordan Peterson, or Jordan Peterson asked me to Jordan...

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,920
Or both of them asked, because he's doing the book of...

27
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,200
Did the book of Exodus?

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,000
They were, I believe, 16 sessions of 90 minutes each.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,720
That's a lot, a lot of time, with no commercials.

30
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,720
How many days did you film this in?

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,720
Oh, eight days.

32
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,720
Eight days.

33
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,680
Yes, eight days each time in Miami.

34
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,680
And it was wonderful.

35
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,920
I loved it.

36
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,640
So what arose at one time, and I've even forgotten about this, it was five minutes out of...

37
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,040
Let's see, what is 16 times an hour and a half, 24 hours.

38
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,520
So it's five minutes out of 24 hours.

39
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,640
What happened was, I don't even remember how the issue arose, but I mentioned that there

40
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,520
is a Jewish-Christian difference with regard to Jesus' statement that a man who lost after

41
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,840
another woman has committed adultery with his heart.

42
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,720
That A, that phrase does not appear, obviously, in the Hebrew Bible, but B, that the general

43
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,600
Jewish view, and I say general because I can't speak for all Jews, even though I try to be

44
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:29,000
normative, is that you can only commit adultery with, and I said this in the video, and I

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,480
purposely said, I'm not trying at all to be cute in any way.

46
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,560
You can only commit adultery with one organ and it is not the heart.

47
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,360
Judaism is very behavior-based.

48
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,520
Christianity is more...

49
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:53,680
It's not that it's not behavior-based, but it is equally, if not more, thought, inner-self,

50
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,680
heart-based.

51
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,600
So for example, there's a phrase in Hebrew that I learned very early in my Yeshiva education.

52
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,120
I'll say it in Hebrew so that people will know I didn't make it up.

53
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,680
Oh, ha'mah shavah, yikar el ha'mah, say it is not the thought that counts, that, no, not

54
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,320
that counts, that is the essence, but the deed.

55
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,240
Judaism is very behavior-ist, and I am very behavior-ist.

56
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:24,280
So for example, and I mention this at Franciscan, I've said on the radio very often, I don't

57
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,800
care if you like Jews, I don't care if you dislike Jews, I prefer you like Jews, but

58
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,920
there are a lot of Jews I don't like, I mean it's just a little silly to say I like a whole

59
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,720
group, there's no whole group I like, there's no whole group I dislike, but in any event,

60
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,200
I don't care if you dislike Jews, I care how you treat Jews.

61
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:52,720
And that is, it goes to the essence of what my belief is, I want to know how you act.

62
00:03:52,720 --> 00:04:01,080
The left does this all the time, oh, you treat gays beautifully, like in my case, my wife

63
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:07,240
and I are godparents to a gay couple's children, but the fact that I'm against a same-sex marriage,

64
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,520
that makes me a hater.

65
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:15,120
So how I treat gays is irrelevant, it's what I think.

66
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,600
This bothers me that your thoughts can be regarded as a demerit.

67
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,760
But see, your thoughts wouldn't be uncharitable towards people with same-sex attraction, you

68
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:30,280
would just think that the behavior is presumably sinful.

69
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,200
So they would be wrong in their thinking of you as a homophobe.

70
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:40,760
Bothers me the most is that we redefine marriage.

71
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,160
My Leviticus commentary comes out, that'll be the fifth of my five-volume commentary

72
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:52,400
on the Torah, I have already written 22,000 words on one verse, which of course I've never

73
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:59,040
done for any other verse about a man shall not lie with a man as with a woman.

74
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:06,360
And so without even getting into that, the point I wanted to make was, for the left,

75
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,160
what I think renders me awful, not what I do.

76
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:18,680
So my treatment of gays is excellent, but the fact that I don't think marriage should

77
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,320
be redefined is enough to make me a hater, bigot, homophobe, and all the other terms

78
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,320
that they use.

79
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,040
Anyway, back to us.

80
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,160
Let me interject here.

81
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,240
So Aristotle in the Nicomachean Ethics has these four levels of the vicious to the virtuous

82
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
man.

83
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,360
The vicious man is the one who wants to do evil and does it, and he has the incontinent

84
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,280
man, the continent man, but he says the virtuous man is the one who wants to do the good and

85
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,360
does it.

86
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:52,640
And so to me, I have children, if one of them held anti-Semitic views but treated you kindly,

87
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,120
I would say, well, that's better than holding anti-Semitic views and being bad toward you,

88
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,120
but I wouldn't.

89
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,960
I would think that's not where I would settle.

90
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
I would want him to...

91
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
That's fine.

92
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
That's fine.

93
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
I respect that.

94
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,800
And I also want to say that I think I agree with you that obviously adultery and lust

95
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
are different things.

96
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,760
If they weren't different things, we wouldn't have two separate words for them.

97
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,760
Right?

98
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760
Yeah.

99
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:25,000
Which comes somewhat of a revelation to my Christian friends is there is no sin of the...

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,160
There are 613 laws in the Torah, none of them say do not lust.

101
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,360
You can't covet.

102
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,880
Covet is a very different concept than lust.

103
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,680
Covet means you want to take what belongs to another, and it is a very simple proof

104
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,120
that it doesn't mean lust.

105
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,080
Covet, you don't lust after a house or a donkey, one presumes, and yet you're not allowed

106
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,560
to covet those either.

107
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,760
So do you make a distinction between sexual desire and lust?

108
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
Do you see a distinction?

109
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
No, I don't.

110
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
Okay.

111
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,800
So therefore, if you don't see a distinction between those two things, I can see why you

112
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,560
would think it insane to tell somebody they shouldn't lust.

113
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,960
I don't know how you sexually desire your wife and have no lust for her.

114
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,560
Oh, I do.

115
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
Okay.

116
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
So I would think that...

117
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,560
That's interesting.

118
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,560
I would think that lust...

119
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,560
So you think so lust...

120
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
Okay.

121
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
Yeah, you're right.

122
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
This is interesting.

123
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
I've never confronted it quite this way.

124
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,560
So lust is...

125
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,560
Lust reduces the subject to an object.

126
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,480
It subordinates the dignity of the person to the good of a selfish pleasure.

127
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,440
It's also a distorted sexual act.

128
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:31,560
So it's an act which is contrary to human nature or to the end of the sexual act.

129
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,000
So if sexual desire and lust are different, can you sexually desire a woman you're not

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,800
married to and not lust for her?

131
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Yes.

132
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Oh.

133
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
I would think so.

134
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Okay.

135
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
I haven't heard that from a Christian before.

136
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,160
Three stages, if I would think of it.

137
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,560
If I board an airplane and I sit next to a beautiful woman and I'm attracted to her

138
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,680
sexually, how could I not be?

139
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
Okay.

140
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,680
That's beyond my control.

141
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,040
Now, the next step could be, now what do I do with that?

142
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,080
Do I sit here and fantasize about what I could do with her sexually?

143
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,600
At that point, the will is engaged and that is something within my control.

144
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,520
So I think it is important to make that distinction and I think that might be part of what drives

145
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:16,240
some Christians neurotic if they think, well, sexual desire is a sin, can't sexually desire

146
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
anybody who isn't my wife.

147
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:25,360
Not only Christians, but I think in some cases with Jews too, that it does drive people

148
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,360
to be neurotic.

149
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,920
It's like if I said you don't think of a pink elephant.

150
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
Well, better.

151
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,760
You're in a restaurant, don't think of food because that's a real life.

152
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,760
Very bad.

153
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,760
Stop it.

154
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,760
Yeah.

155
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,760
You'd go crazy.

156
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,160
The more you don't think about it, the more you think about it.

157
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,480
So there's that element too.

158
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,480
Agreed.

159
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:52,600
So I differ with you and I did with the father and by the way, I mentioned this is very important

160
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
to note.

161
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,600
What a credit it is to Franciscan University A having me, A as a religious Jew obviously

162
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:05,840
doesn't believe in Christ, not a Christian, and B that they discuss openly with me at

163
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:11,200
the university what they heard me say on Daily Wire.

164
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,960
But he did raise this issue about sexual objectification and that reduces the human

165
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:23,200
being as one created God's image, et cetera, just what you said now.

166
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,360
And I have a different view of that.

167
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,360
Sure.

168
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,920
I think this, I suspect you may have not heard this before in one of your podcasts.

169
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,920
Here we go.

170
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,640
Here's one of your guests.

171
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:44,840
I think that in the bedroom, if a loving husband who is a loving husband and I have

172
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,280
a word to say about what a loving husband is, a loving husband who sees his wife in

173
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:56,520
the bedroom as a sexual object, I will be totally open with you.

174
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:02,680
I have said on the radio, if after X number of years married, your husband still sees

175
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,440
you as a sex object, you are both very lucky.

176
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,600
I would say it depends what you mean by sex object.

177
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,480
If what you mean is your husband continues to find you sexually desirable, I would agree

178
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,600
with you.

179
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,280
If what you mean is the man essentially treats his wife as a warm body to masturbate in, not

180
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,080
taking into account her feelings, her desires.

181
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,400
Oh, of course.

182
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:30,800
But that's not objectification as a dirty meme.

183
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,320
He said, the father said, one shouldn't even objectivize baseball players.

184
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,720
And it was an excellent analogy.

185
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,420
I had thought of that myself.

186
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,600
But I do objectivize the baseball player.

187
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,320
I'm not sure if I agree with him.

188
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,520
But it doesn't mean that you would automatically mistreat the baseball player.

189
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,520
That's right.

190
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,240
But I'm in a different relationship with the baseball player than I am with the one I

191
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,240
married to.

192
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,240
Correct.

193
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,240
But there is a place in the totality of a relationship.

194
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,400
So here is my motto because I talk about men and women every week for an hour on my radio

195
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,880
show and I have for about 20 years.

196
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:07,880
And that is you make love outside the bedroom and you have sex inside the bedroom.

197
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:13,760
I think it's a romanticization of the sex act to say that it's always making love.

198
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,040
It's OK to make lust.

199
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,520
It's OK to have some objectification.

200
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,760
That doesn't mean you're mistreating her.

201
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,120
Yeah, I think I'd want to know what you mean by objectification.

202
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,520
Because I had the sense that you're using language to convey something that I might agree with.

203
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,520
Yes, you might.

204
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,520
You really might.

205
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,520
I agree with you.

206
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,120
It certainly doesn't mean mistreat.

207
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,740
It's not even implied.

208
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:37,440
But any more than with the baseball player.

209
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,080
And you'll say, well, I have a different relationship with the baseball player, but you're right.

210
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,080
Sex is its own world.

211
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,080
I don't like to romanticize sex.

212
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,040
Sex is many, many things.

213
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,480
Sometimes it's love.

214
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,120
Sometimes it's just pure sex.

215
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,800
When it's pure sex and not just love, there is an element of objectification.

216
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,480
I'm crazy about her legs.

217
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,080
Is that a statement of love?

218
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,520
What do you mean?

219
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,640
You don't love legs.

220
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,520
What do you mean by love?

221
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:06,720
Right.

222
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,480
So I would say Aristotle and Aquinas would say that to love is to will the good of the other for their sake.

223
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,640
So I don't will my wife's good for my sake.

224
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,560
It's not like I say, honey, I really need you to go to CrossFit so I can lust after you.

225
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,440
Well, what?

226
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,920
But if I want her to get healthy for her sake, then this is love.

227
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,160
But if she says to you, honey, there's a certain thing that you could do for me sexually

228
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,920
that will really turn me on.

229
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,960
And it may not really turn you on.

230
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,400
Are you being objectivized or are you doing it because you love her and because she wants it?

231
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,640
Well, first of all, she's asked a question in which I presumably am free to decline as she.

232
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,680
Oh, if she's not free to decline, that's coercion.

233
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,680
And there's no room for that.

234
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,640
Right. So there is an objectification of coercion or not the same thing.

235
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,040
Which I'm free to decline.

236
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,560
Right. So, honey, would you put on this sexy outfit for me?

237
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,720
Are you OK with that?

238
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,280
Me? Yeah.

239
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,520
Buddy, hell, that's a question I didn't expect you to ask me.

240
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
Well, you opened it up.

241
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,480
I would not be OK with that.

242
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,680
That's interesting. I don't think.

243
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,200
Even in the bedroom.

244
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,560
It's not that I'd be morally opposed to it.

245
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,520
It's just that I'd feel uncomfortable with it.

246
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,560
Well, my view is that the more comfort the couple has, the better the relationship.

247
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,560
I think that's right.

248
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,640
So long as comfort doesn't lead to what I would consider to be sexually perverse acts.

249
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,200
Well, why is it sexually perverse to wear a sexy outfit?

250
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,800
It's not. And that's why I said I'm not morally opposed to it.

251
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,800
But if you're saying that the discomfort is personal, that's fair.

252
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,200
I that's not an area I need to get into.

253
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,400
One thing I would love you to get into, because you did say this in the email,

254
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,520
is you think that the widespread proliferation of property is destroying teenagers.

255
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,360
Help help help help people hear this side of what I given.

256
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,560
I gave an example tonight.

257
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,360
So I'm very friendly with a young woman.

258
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,760
She's 23, very, very close to her.

259
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,600
People could guess who it is, because I do a podcast with her.

260
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,800
So she is so open.

261
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,520
God bless her.

262
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,080
I don't think she would object to my to my telling this story.

263
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,200
In fact, maybe it was even discussed on one of our podcasts.

264
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,920
We're very, very open.

265
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,480
So she was on a date and they were both a track.

266
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,520
It was not the first date and they kissed.

267
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,480
It's all they did. They kissed.

268
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,760
And in the midst of the kiss, he he grabbed her neck.

269
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,280
Oh, like this.

270
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,440
And even me, Mr.

271
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,880
Open was taken aback.

272
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,800
And and so was she to her credit.

273
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,080
She when she took his hand away, she said either then or later

274
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,360
that evening or later another time.

275
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,680
Why did you do that?

276
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,680
And he to his credit was open enough to say, I thought you would like it.

277
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,000
That's what I see on the Internet.

278
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,360
That's a bad thing that that's that's

279
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:59,120
the number of young men who learn about women through porn

280
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,400
and not real life is a very scary thing that has developed.

281
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,080
So I am I am as worried as you are

282
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,440
about the pornification of society.

283
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,760
When I answered the question that Jordan Peterson asked,

284
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,760
which came out of nowhere, I'm not blaming him in the least.

285
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,160
It was a perfectly legit question, but it came out of nowhere.

286
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,640
I was thinking still in the way I have always defined it as Playboy magazine.

287
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,280
That to me, that was porn.

288
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,360
The stuff that is out there now is not what I think of when I'm asked the question.

289
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,760
And and so I did say this to the father tonight,

290
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,040
and I'm sure it shocked everybody there.

291
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,440
Did you ask it? No, keep going.

292
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,240
Make a bad you'll get it.

293
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,560
You'll get a charge out of this intellectually.

294
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,360
It'll blow your mind, I think.

295
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,480
So my dad was an Orthodox Jew, a modern Orthodox, admittedly,

296
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,560
but Orthodox did never drove on the Sabbath, never ate a non kosher food.

297
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,400
Wariamolka and the house sent the kids to Yeshiva.

298
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,320
I mean, he was the real deal.

299
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,160
He was the president of the Kingsway Jewish Center.

300
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,160
Still exists an Orthodox synagogue in Brooklyn, New York.

301
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,320
And he subscribed to Playboy, which shocks Jews as well as non-Jews, to be honest.

302
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,880
Good. OK. Yeah.

303
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,640
Glad that it does. Yes. OK.

304
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,920
However, so I I I was raised in a very sexually open home

305
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,960
that was also deeply religious, and I never found them conflicting

306
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,520
as he didn't.

307
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,440
And so he was an outlier.

308
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,280
I acknowledge and I am an outlier.

309
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,320
I acknowledge.

310
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,760
However, I want people to understand my parents were together 72 years

311
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,560
and they loved each other crazy when she died at eighty nine.

312
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
He died at ninety six.

313
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,880
He basically his life ended.

314
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,640
His screensaver was I love you, Hindi.

315
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,800
That was his nickname for her.

316
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,960
Her name was Hilda, and she knew he got Playboy.

317
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,400
This did not did not trouble my mother.

318
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,280
Oh, that's Mac. OK.

319
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,800
I'm married to a live wire who was faithful and who loved me.

320
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,760
And she was crazy about him.

321
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,800
And that and that and that was it.

322
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,680
What would be better for your father

323
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,920
to love your mother and get Playboy or for your father to say,

324
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,120
even though I'm tempted to look at pornography,

325
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,840
my wife's body is enough for me and I'm not going to look at that,

326
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,440
even though I'm tempted to. That's a very fair question.

327
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:31,520
I don't have an answer, which will I should give you the answer you want.

328
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,040
I think you should, too. Yes, that's a good point.

329
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,040
You do. I don't know what that means enough.

330
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,360
As I said, which bothers is funny.

331
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,800
There were two groups that it bothers.

332
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,320
The very religious and the radical feminist.

333
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,640
When I say that men are variety built in,

334
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,080
God made male sexual nature as variety oriented as one.

335
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,120
I don't know who put it this way, but one would put it.

336
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,160
A woman loves a man and men love women.

337
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,800
Now, I don't want men to go around loving women.

338
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,280
I'm totally opposed to that.

339
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,400
I am I am and insist on my being.

340
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,360
It's not it's not even debatable that I am faithful to my wife.

341
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,080
It's a given.

342
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,200
My wife knows that other women are a turn on.

343
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,560
She knows it. It does not bother her.

344
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,760
She she is she to my luck.

345
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,680
I am married to a woman who does not find male sexual nature frightening.

346
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,600
Most women do. And by the way, I understand that.

347
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,160
But again, I think we have to make the distinction

348
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,960
between sexual arousal and sitting and fantasizing or watching.

349
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,280
Actually, they looked at it together.

350
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,600
And if you. Well, that's sad, too, I think.

351
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,920
I don't. Why is it said?

352
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,680
Because I think pornography is a version of the sexual act.

353
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,320
Yeah. Well, OK, which is holy.

354
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,520
What if they looked OK?

355
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,400
Let me finish, which is God's first commandment to humanity.

356
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,040
Be fruitful and multiply.

357
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,080
It is the most intimate thing two human beings can do together.

358
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,160
Not watch the office.

359
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,840
No, not go for a walk on the beach.

360
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,960
It's the fundamental act that brings about the family,

361
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,560
which brings about society.

362
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,640
I'm of the opinion that if you pervert that fundamental I don't know why.

363
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,640
It's why. Why is it perverted?

364
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,880
Why is it because it usurps the natural end of sexual intercourse?

365
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,720
If I eat food and then force myself to throw up, I'm usurping.

366
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,920
OK, but I don't think that that it's a fair analogy.

367
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,360
Let's say they look very fair.

368
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,960
Let's say they looked at at bathing suit ads, not at Playboy.

369
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,480
Just they looked at that other beautiful women together that that.

370
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,600
And it was OK with my mother.

371
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,640
Obviously, the assumption is it was OK with my mother.

372
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,840
If it wasn't, then it's not a good thing. Clearly.

373
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:48,240
I am more worried about men having to hide their nature.

374
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,360
See, when you say God has built into their nature,

375
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,560
a desire for variety, it sounds like you're saying that therefore

376
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,000
it would be unnatural to not look at pornography.

377
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,000
Well, forget the word pornography because it's so loaded.

378
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,720
I'm anti pornography.

379
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,760
But if pornography means anything that is arousing,

380
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,600
then it could be a bra ad. Right.

381
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,440
Well, I think I could define pornography like this.

382
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,400
I could say material which depicts a rotec behavior.

383
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,760
That's not behavior.

384
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,920
There's no behavior in Playboy. OK.

385
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,080
Well, it's not behavior.

386
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,600
I think that's an important distinction.

387
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,760
I think what when you say behavior, I think you're meaning video or.

388
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,800
No, I didn't. That's why that's why I read.

389
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,840
Then no, I don't I'm I am not

390
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,720
advocate of watching sexual behavior, but I want to know what you mean

391
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,200
by the word behavior, because if I'm going to say it's sexual,

392
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,400
sexual activity between two people.

393
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,680
OK, so even a photograph in Playboy of two people engaging in it.

394
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,560
But there weren't such when I.

395
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,320
That's when you were opposed to that,

396
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,960
but you're OK with a man looking at one naked woman, let's say.

397
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,160
Yes, or they weren't even naked then.

398
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,760
They were covered in their privates.

399
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,440
Right. But but you're opposed to them

400
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,720
looking at anything that might be arousing.

401
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,600
You're what if a woman is wearing a regular

402
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,840
what if a man is turned on, which every man is,

403
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,200
by an attractive woman in a nice dress?

404
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,640
That's a turn on. So no, no, no, please answer.

405
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,840
So is that bad?

406
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,920
I'm going to add his wife.

407
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,480
I'm going to answer, but let me unfold this a little bit.

408
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,400
I think pornography can sometimes be a difficult thing to define.

409
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,120
I would say, and let me see if I can redefine it for you,

410
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,880
material that depicts

411
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:28,520
something that's intended to sexually arouse or replace replace a prostitute.

412
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,800
I mean, the word pornography comes from two Greek words,

413
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,920
porne graph pain, which means the writing or the drawing of the prostitutes.

414
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,600
It's meant to serve an erotic function.

415
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,680
And so what if the but what if the eroticism is then is then.

416
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,120
So I'm OK with the wife.

417
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,520
I'm OK looking at breasts and I'm OK looking at bums.

418
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,400
And I if you go to the Sistine Chapel,

419
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,280
you'll see that Catholics are perfectly comfortable with nudity.

420
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,640
But I think that nudity can be presented in a way

421
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,440
that upholds and expresses the dignity of the person.

422
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,240
So I could say, OK, I could look at that and marvel at God's creation

423
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,320
and the beauty of woman and the beauty of man.

424
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,680
But I think I could also look at a lingerie catalog

425
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,600
and in my mind treat this person as a mere object.

426
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,800
So I would say

427
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,560
that in one aspect I'm OK looking at breasts, let's say, Sistine Chapel.

428
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,880
But in another sense, if I'm looking at a lingerie catalog

429
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,040
with the intention of lusting it, that wouldn't be OK.

430
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,640
What if I'm looking at the lingerie catalog

431
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,880
with the intention of getting my wife lingerie?

432
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,640
I think the intention does matter. Yeah.

433
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,520
OK. All right.

434
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,440
Yeah. We're not that far.

435
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,920
I'm not advocating this.

436
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,680
I know you're not.

437
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,920
And I really want that to get.

438
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,960
Yeah, yes, it's very important.

439
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,840
But I I'm so worried.

440
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,520
Remember, I come from the woman calling my show.

441
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,160
I saw I saw pictures on my husband's computer.

442
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,600
I'm devastated.

443
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,440
So what am I supposed to say?

444
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,840
You know what?

445
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,240
You're right to be devastated.

446
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,040
Your husband is a real sinner.

447
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,600
He treats you as an object.

448
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,040
What would you like me to say to her?

449
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,960
Here's what I'd like you to say.

450
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,040
I think you could.

451
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,120
I don't think you have to say.

452
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,040
I think I would I think I would begin by validating her pain.

453
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,560
I wouldn't dismiss it by.

454
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,520
And I'm not saying you did this

455
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,920
because I haven't heard this sort of phone call.

456
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,200
But I wouldn't dismiss it by saying

457
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,480
you're wrong to be hurt.

458
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,720
I would say there are many things out there

459
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,200
that your husband, I'm sure, loves you very much.

460
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,880
Well, that's my first question to her.

461
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,520
And you're right.

462
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,760
This is does he love you and is he loving

463
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,400
and do you have a good love life?

464
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:29,960
And I yeah.

465
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,400
And this is what I'll be if the answers are all.

466
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,280
Yes, go on.

467
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,760
So if the answers are all, yes, I would say, well,

468
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,720
since he loves you and since this bothers you,

469
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,720
there are some excellent resources

470
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,680
that I'd love to tell you about

471
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,800
that could help him be free of pornography.

472
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,600
Because surely you would say if a man is looking at pornography

473
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,720
and his wife's heartbroken, you're not saying, well,

474
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,080
she's wrong to be and he doesn't need to change.

475
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,200
If she's heartbroken, wouldn't you want to say to the man,

476
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,760
here are some ways that you could quit?

477
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,960
Yes, I would want to say to both of them.

478
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,480
I understand why your heartbroken

479
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,400
because you think that he loves her more than you

480
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,760
or as much as you.

481
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,160
And I want you to know that's not the case at all.

482
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,480
I don't know if that's the only reason she'd be heartbroken.

483
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,520
I don't think it's that she loves.

484
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,480
I think that pornography trains us in selfishness.

485
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,560
Yes, so.

486
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,880
It also legitimizes.

487
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,440
So a lot of he says to her, well, look,

488
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,800
you saw lingerie ads and I'm dying to buy you

489
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,120
some really cute lingerie.

490
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,800
Would you be okay with that?

491
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,080
I would say that we're verging on what's sometimes called

492
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,520
the fallacy of the beard.

493
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,640
You ever heard of this?

494
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,880
Just because you don't know when something begins,

495
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,240
it doesn't mean you can't say what a thing is.

496
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,480
This isn't a beard.

497
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,240
But in the three months, if I didn't shave,

498
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,840
it would be and just because you don't know

499
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,600
when it started doesn't mean you can't say what a beard is.

500
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,880
And I would say that there are blurry lines.

501
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,920
I would agree with you.

502
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,920
Like a Victoria's Secret fashion show.

503
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,760
Is that pornography?

504
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,240
I'd say probably, what about,

505
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,000
but is it less bad than other forms of pornography?

506
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,840
Yes.

507
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,480
Not all pornography is equal.

508
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,800
Some pornography can be far more ratchet than others.

509
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,440
We're really not that far apart.

510
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,880
I, my biggest, one of my biggest teachings

511
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,280
is that there are levels of sin

512
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,520
and there are levels of good.

513
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,360
And that we should not listen.

514
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,240
I don't think this is not a Catholic thing,

515
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,480
but many Protestants who listen to my show

516
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,960
take issue with me when I say

517
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,960
that God does not regard stealing a stapler from the office

518
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,240
as he does child molestation.

519
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,400
And they call me up and say, Dennis, love you,

520
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,840
but I gotta tell you, a sin is a sin.

521
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,360
Yeah, no, we would part ways with our...

522
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,200
I know you would.

523
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,040
Yes, I know.

524
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,840
I said Catholics and Jews believe in gradations of sin.

525
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,680
Correct, okay.

526
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,640
So there are gradations in that arena as well.

527
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,760
Yes, but I would say that just because something is less bad

528
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,840
than something else, it doesn't make it good.

529
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,680
So if you're saying to the...

530
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,720
Okay, I'm not arguing it's good.

531
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,560
So if you say to the...

532
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,280
I'm arguing it's not as bad

533
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,960
as people often make it out to be.

534
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,840
I am not arguing that it's good.

535
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,680
In an ideal marriage with my father,

536
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,440
not have subscribed to Playboy,

537
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,760
I'll be prepared to say yes, however.

538
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,600
Look at you, good job.

539
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,080
Yes, yeah, but it doesn't gain you as much as you think

540
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,040
because I saw their relationship for seven,

541
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,960
I didn't see it for 72 years, obviously,

542
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,880
but I saw it for the bulk of their life.

543
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,800
And the respect with which he treated her.

544
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,640
I'm sure he did.

545
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,200
I'm not making the claim that you have

546
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,200
pure pristine holy marriage and haven of filth.

547
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,040
I'm not saying that those are only two options.

548
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,080
Right, okay, so fine, so there are degrees.

549
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,040
But if you're saying to the woman,

550
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,200
better for him to look at porn than to commit adultery,

551
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,000
then what I would say there is,

552
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,920
it might be less bad, all things being equal,

553
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,800
but less bad doesn't make it good.

554
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,960
And if adultery can be analogized

555
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,000
to shooting your marriage in the head,

556
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,480
I would say pornography is the slow poisoning of it

557
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,840
and that there's a great deal of research

558
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,720
to be able to back that up.

559
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,840
Yes, well.

560
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,080
In fact, Dennis, I'm gonna get your book on Exodus.

561
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,840
I promise to look at it.

562
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,280
This is my book on pornography.

563
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,040
It's a non-religious response to pro-porn arguments.

564
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,200
Oh yeah, I'll be very happy to read it.

565
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,720
And I'll sign it so it'll be worth more

566
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,680
in the garage sale one day.

567
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,840
But there's no talk of sin, there's no scripture verses.

568
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,920
It's all based on the 40 plus years of science

569
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,400
that's coming out of academia from neuroscience.

570
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,640
So here's the question.

571
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,160
Okay, so you see, the reason I actually

572
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,480
never talk about pornography.

573
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,920
He asked me, you were asked me.

574
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,760
This is your news.

575
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,840
I never do, I certainly don't advocate it.

576
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,880
I don't even discuss it, let alone advocate it.

577
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,240
But it was asked, and I sort of took a vow many years ago,

578
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,960
I won't avoid questions.

579
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,640
I wish I had known in advance it would be discussed.

580
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,920
I would have said how much I'm horrified

581
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,160
by the pornification of society, et cetera.

582
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:00,040
But we, I want to, we're on so many different,

583
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,440
related but different tracks.

584
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,520
And it's a very important subject.

585
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,840
Oh yes, I was influenced by my parents' marriage.

586
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,760
We're all influenced by our parents' marriage.

587
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,440
If you see your father beat your mother,

588
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,120
you think that's normal and you end up beating your wife.

589
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,560
Of course, my father, I mean,

590
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,440
the thought that he would ever lift it,

591
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,360
he wouldn't, it's so inconceivable to me.

592
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,720
All he did was tell his sons

593
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,640
how much he loved their mother.

594
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,880
I mean, constantly.

595
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,480
So what I saw was a man got Playboy

596
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,920
and loved his wife for 72 years.

597
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,120
She knew he got Playboy and loved her husband

598
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,600
and knew he loved her for 72 years.

599
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,680
So that's what I saw.

600
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,440
And I'm not going to sit here as their child

601
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,920
and say, this was really awful.

602
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,560
When I can't say it because I would be lying.

603
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,280
But if you ask me, is there an ideal?

604
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,080
I will argue, okay, there is an ideal.

605
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,200
But the human condition is messy.

606
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,200
So back to our earlier question,

607
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,800
where we differ on can a loving husband

608
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,840
in the bedroom ever see his wife as a sex object?

609
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,680
And I said, that's good.

610
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,800
See, that's there.

611
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,760
Finally, we have a real difference.

612
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,600
I actually think that is a positive.

613
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,680
I don't know if we do have a disagreement.

614
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,520
If by sex object, you mean

615
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,600
you find your wife sexually desirable.

616
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,520
I don't know what the difference is.

617
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,360
What's the difference?

618
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,560
I think this is what I would say, right?

619
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,200
As subject, like man is made

620
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,720
and man makes his own ends, right?

621
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,840
Slavery is wrong because we take a man

622
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,360
who makes his own ends and would like to fulfill them.

623
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,720
When I talk about objectification,

624
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,000
I guess I'm talking about a sort of evacuation

625
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,440
of the subject of the person.

626
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,840
I'm not concerned about her.

627
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,680
I'm not concerned about her.

628
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,000
You draw an inference that I'm not implying.

629
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,400
And that's why I say I don't know if we're disagreeing.

630
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,240
We may not.

631
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,360
That would be great to resolve it.

632
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,800
I'm totally happy with that if that happens.

633
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,640
How you treat her is not that you will treat her badly.

634
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,800
The moment women don't say I'm crazy

635
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,360
about my husband's legs, okay?

636
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,920
But a man may not say it.

637
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,760
Well, that's true.

638
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,760
Fair enough.

639
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,680
Okay, I'll ask your wife, okay.

640
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,640
But every man thinks that way

641
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,560
if there's a part of her body

642
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,840
that is particularly a turn on to use the term do him.

643
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,520
That is objectification.

644
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,080
Women don't do that.

645
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,240
Women don't, very, I mean, young women do.

646
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,600
Oh, he's got a great butt.

647
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,040
By objectification, do you mean I find a part

648
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,800
of my wife's body that I find attractive sexually?

649
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,640
Yeah.

650
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,480
Yeah, all right.

651
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,800
I suppose that for me, objectification means

652
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,200
sort of subordinating the good of my wife

653
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,520
to a selfish pleasure.

654
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:20,360
You have drawn a behavioral inference from a thought

655
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,200
and I don't.

656
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,040
Yeah.

657
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,640
But see, I still am not convinced

658
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,080
that this sharp distinction or the distinction,

659
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,120
because I've heard Ben Shapiro say something similar.

660
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,680
And so I don't know if this is,

661
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,320
as you say, more of a behaviorist, kind of Jewish idea,

662
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,320
because I think he said something like,

663
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,200
I don't really care if you have racist thoughts.

664
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,240
I care about how you act.

665
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,080
That's right.

666
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,080
I said that to the group tonight.

667
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,640
I don't care if people dislike Jews.

668
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,680
I care how they treat us.

669
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,880
But if my son or daughter.

670
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,840
I know you're right.

671
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,640
I would tell the same to my child.

672
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,760
If my child said, I don't like this group.

673
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,880
But I think this is what our Lord Jesus Christ is doing,

674
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,840
in which he's saying your righteousness

675
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,760
has to pass out of the Pharisees.

676
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:59,760
It's not enough that you don't murder.

677
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,720
You should not want to.

678
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,800
It's not enough that you don't commit adultery.

679
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,880
You should not say fuel the flame

680
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,840
that could lead to that.

681
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,320
I happen to think it's a good thing

682
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,200
not to want to murder.

683
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,680
I subscribe to that.

684
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,920
But there's a very interesting Hebrew phrase

685
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,160
translating from the Hebrew.

686
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,160
So it'll be a bit awkward.

687
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,160
In the place that a penitent stands,

688
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,960
the most righteous person doesn't stand.

689
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,920
And I extrapolate from that,

690
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:36,920
that if you have bad thoughts and don't act on them,

691
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,200
you're on a higher moral plane

692
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,240
than the guy who never has a bad thought.

693
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,000
I don't get any credit for not molesting children.

694
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,280
I'm as interested in children sexually

695
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,320
as I am in bananas or peach trees.

696
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,600
So I get no credit for not molesting a child.

697
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,280
But the sick dude who does want to and doesn't,

698
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,840
he gets a lot of credit.

699
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,120
So speaking of pedophilia,

700
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,960
suppose a man says, I view animated child porn.

701
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,320
So there's no real victim in that sense of child pornography,

702
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,960
which we both agree is horrendous.

703
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,360
And by viewing animated child porn,

704
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,040
it prevents me from acting out sexually on a child.

705
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,480
Now, I deny that.

706
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,240
I think that pornography inflames us

707
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,120
to then want to act those fantasies out.

708
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,280
And I think there's good studies that back that up.

709
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,200
But surely you wouldn't say to the man

710
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,480
who views animated child pornography,

711
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,040
that's not bad so long as you don't act it out.

712
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,120
Wouldn't you want to help this poor sick dude?

713
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,360
Yes, I would.

714
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,640
But I am thrilled that he's not acting it out.

715
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,080
I mean, of course.

716
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,480
Well, that's big.

717
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,480
We're both thrilled that he might have a poor substitute,

718
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,560
but it is a substitute if that were the case.

719
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,320
No child is being used.

720
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,840
It's all animated.

721
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,600
And he-

722
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,360
But would you use the word evil

723
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,720
of animated child pornography?

724
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,000
Because I certainly would.

725
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,280
No, I would use evil only with behavior.

726
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,400
That's where we might differ from forgetting the sex issue.

727
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,240
You can't be evil.

728
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,360
You didn't do evil if you thought evil.

729
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,200
You did evil if you committed-

730
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,960
If I'm masturbating to animated pictures of pornography,

731
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,960
I'm not doing something evil.

732
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,800
That's correct.

733
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,000
Yeah, I think that's despicable.

734
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,840
Yeah.

735
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,680
Really?

736
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,600
Yes, of course.

737
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,440
Who is being hurt?

738
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,600
You have to have a victim.

739
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,000
Oh, I'll tell you, there's at least two people being hurt.

740
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,160
There's the person who's poisoning himself

741
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,440
by encouraging him to think-

742
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,280
Yes, yes, you're right.

743
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,120
Acting out on children.

744
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,600
And there's also the animator-

745
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,440
Okay, wait a minute.

746
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,640
We both are aching for him not to have those fantasies.

747
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,080
I agree with you, but I-

748
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,040
But you won't call it evil.

749
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,880
I won't call a fantasy evil.

750
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,240
There's too much real evil on earth

751
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,840
for me to start being preoccupied with people's thinking.

752
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,840
It's not just thinking.

753
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,280
It's him masturbating to-

754
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,120
Yes, he's okay.

755
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,080
Okay, so the real question about the whole pornography issue

756
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,880
is not pornography, it's masturbation.

757
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,280
There was a Catholic tradition-

758
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,120
I disagree.

759
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,480
I think it's both.

760
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,960
I think both masturbation is evil,

761
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,280
but I think pornography is a greater evil, I would say.

762
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,880
Okay, so I don't think masturbation is evil.

763
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,880
Okay, that's, and by the way,

764
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,080
I admit that within Orthodox Judaism,

765
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,320
there is, when I was a counselor at Orthodox Jewish camp,

766
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,480
the kids were told by some of their rabbis

767
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,000
that masturbation is like murder.

768
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,560
And there was that, there was also that.

769
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,680
There's a statement like that.

770
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,880
I certainly wouldn't make that statement.

771
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,560
Okay, I do believe that in Catholic theology,

772
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,400
there is-

773
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,720
No, no, no.

774
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,120
No Catholic is saying that murder

775
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,160
is equivalent to masturbation.

776
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,000
Okay, all right, good.

777
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,640
You might say that both are grave sins,

778
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,120
but you wouldn't say that masturbation is a graver sin.

779
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,080
Even within murder,

780
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,600
patricide would be a graver sin

781
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,440
than killing a stranger.

782
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,960
So since we both believe murder is always wrong,

783
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,840
obviously self-defense is killing not murder,

784
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,760
so murder is always wrong.

785
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,760
Child molestation is always wrong.

786
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,720
Is masturbation always wrong?

787
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,360
What about a man whose wife, and I had this example,

788
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,560
now you may say, well, if you take an extreme example,

789
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,760
it's not fair.

790
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,600
But if you say always,

791
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,760
I have to take a real life example of a man I knew

792
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,520
who adored his wife.

793
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,280
I knew them when they were both Welsh.

794
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,520
She got Alzheimer's at a very early age in her 50s,

795
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,840
and he dressed her and bathed her

796
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,880
and cleaned her up for a decade.

797
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,880
And if this man, with a wife who no longer recognized him,

798
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,680
masturbated to get rid of his sexual tension

799
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,920
and stayed to take care of his wife,

800
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,200
you would say that was evil?

801
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,080
I would, because I think that evil

802
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,000
is the way things shouldn't be.

803
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
And I think the sexual act exists for union,

804
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,320
and to masturbate is to thwart the end of that natural act.

805
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,000
I also think that what we haven't taken into account yet

806
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,400
is an industry that brutalizes women

807
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,160
that's often involved in trafficking women.

808
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,040
Oh, that's why I said, I've against all of that.

809
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,080
I'm on your side on that.

810
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,280
Yes, I was talking about pictures,

811
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,920
still pictures of models.

812
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,760
But I'm still saying that this brutalizes women.

813
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,040
I think it's like, what woman would you like him to look at?

814
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,120
Like your wife, your daughter, my daughter?

815
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,320
Would you be comfortable with someone you know and love

816
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,920
being looked at like that?

817
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,040
I wouldn't. No, but it's, you're using,

818
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:16,080
you're bringing the emotional.

819
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,400
I would say you're doing that.

820
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,160
I think you're doing that when you use this story.

821
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,120
I would not deny that this is a virtuous man

822
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,680
in many respects, laudable,

823
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,920
who I could learn a great deal from.

824
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,520
Right, but no, no, you use the word evil.

825
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,360
That's right. That's right.

826
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,440
Okay, you define evil in a way I don't.

827
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,160
The way things shouldn't be, I would say.

828
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,560
And I would refer to natural evil.

829
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,240
So if a man is born blind, this is a natural evil.

830
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,800
If a stone is blind, this is not a natural evil.

831
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
But I would also refer to moral evil

832
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,480
as this is the way things shouldn't be.

833
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,200
So we disagree on that.

834
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:49,200
Yes, so I'm trying to think of, okay,

835
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,440
is it, it shouldn't be that kids spend as much time

836
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,320
as they do on social media.

837
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,000
Do we both agree with that, that they spend too much time?

838
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,520
Yes. Would you call it evil

839
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,440
if they did spend too much time?

840
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,440
Probably yes.

841
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,800
Okay, I wouldn't say it was wrong,

842
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,160
but I wouldn't say it was evil.

843
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,160
So I've shared with you how I define evil.

844
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,000
How do you define it?

845
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,200
Is the deliberate infliction of hurt

846
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,000
on another human being?

847
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,480
So I would say that pornography involves

848
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,040
the deliberate infliction of hurt on another human being

849
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,040
through the photographing of a person.

850
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,960
So that would include lingerie models.

851
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,080
Again, I'm not sure.

852
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,760
I don't have a, I don't know.

853
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,440
Men are as capable of masturbating to lingerie models

854
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,040
as they are to awful stuff.

855
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,080
Right. So what I think the goal should be

856
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,040
is to line up the goal of the artist or the photographer

857
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,760
and the goal and the intention of the viewer

858
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,600
with the dignity of the human person.

859
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,000
Because I can view something non-pornographic

860
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,520
and say masturbate to it.

861
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,360
Right.

862
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,480
The problem isn't with the thing I'm looking at.

863
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,760
The problem's with me.

864
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,320
Likewise, likewise,

865
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,320
I could look through a pornographic magazine

866
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,160
and feel nothing but pity

867
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,920
for these women who don't know their dignity.

868
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,040
In that case, objectively, it's photography,

869
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,640
but subjectively, it isn't for me.

870
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,200
So I think you want both to line up

871
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,680
with the dignity of the human person

872
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,520
created in the image.

873
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,640
Wanting to line up with dignity is totally admirable.

874
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,040
Calling the non-lining up is a lingerie model

875
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,240
losing her dignity.

876
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,280
And you may say yes.

877
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,360
Yeah, I think I would say yes.

878
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,200
Yeah, okay.

879
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,040
Yeah.

880
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,200
But again, I want to make a huge distinction

881
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,480
between these gradations.

882
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,320
Well, and so do I.

883
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,200
Something can be far less bad than synchronous.

884
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,480
When people say pornography,

885
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,280
they're thinking of the most awful behaviors.

886
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,360
Well, let me ask you this then,

887
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,440
because it sounded like you were saying

888
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,880
that if a man views pornography

889
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,480
and thereby doesn't commit adultery, it's okay.

890
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,520
No, I didn't say okay.

891
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,600
I said it wasn't awful.

892
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,440
Not horrible, fair enough.

893
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,280
Right.

894
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,120
Thank you for the correction.

895
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:45,960
Yeah.

896
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,880
But you've also said that you're very much opposed

897
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,960
to violent pornography, obviously.

898
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,840
If a man says I need to watch violent pornography

899
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,800
so I don't commit adultery, do you say,

900
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,840
well, okay, that's less bad too?

901
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:03,040
Or do you condemn that with a greater severity?

902
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,680
Well, because the odds are

903
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,760
that the people in it are being hurt.

904
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,160
What if they're willing to be hurt?

905
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,000
What if they enjoy being hurt?

906
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:15,280
So then I more or less subscribe to your vision

907
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,600
of the issue.

908
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,360
But again, I want to remind everybody watching or listening

909
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:25,360
that my vision was of Playboy of the 1960s

910
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,000
when I was a teenager,

911
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,240
which would be regarded today as...

912
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,600
Not even worthy of Netflix.

913
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,160
I mean, what we once called hardcore,

914
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,000
we now call softcore.

915
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,840
Yes, okay.

916
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,000
But we once called softcore, we now call Netflix.

917
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
But I have to ask you and many others

918
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,760
who feel as you do, and I respect it,

919
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,440
is everything...

920
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,680
Well, I did ask you.

921
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,240
I mean, once you say masturbation

922
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,680
under all circumstances is evil,

923
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,200
that I will admit we part company.

924
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,040
Yeah.

925
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:04,880
And that's fine.

926
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,720
I mean, we knew we would disagree.

927
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,560
Yes, that's fine.

928
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,720
And there's also a lot of things we agree about.

929
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,200
There was one, I don't want to say his name

930
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,480
because I may be wrong,

931
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:18,480
but I believe there was one major evangelical leader,

932
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,400
I mean, major.

933
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,280
He was a household name for a while.

934
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,400
Dobson, I think.

935
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,560
Oh, so you didn't know what I'm referring to.

936
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,520
I don't want to misspeak here.

937
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,840
Maybe Thursday you can look this up,

938
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,880
but I believe Dobson at one point justified masturbation

939
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,520
in certain circumstances.

940
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,960
See, what I respect about you

941
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,320
and what I respect about Jordan Peterson

942
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,800
is that very often you tell us to take the hard road.

943
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,040
You're like, yes, it's bloody hard, but be a man.

944
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,960
Like rise up, choose the harder path.

945
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,520
Choose the more virtuous path.

946
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,960
I just wish that you or Peterson would be more emphatic

947
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,440
when it comes to sexual sins

948
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,000
that of course you're tempted to it.

949
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,240
Of course you want to do it.

950
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,200
What's interesting isn't why people masturbate to pornography.

951
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,480
That's obvious.

952
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,720
What's interesting is why people decide they don't want to.

953
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,600
Well, again, why not encourage them?

954
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,720
Don't throw in the word pornography.

955
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,480
Masturbate alone is a sin to you and evil.

956
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,840
What if he's masturbating to an image he makes up in his brain?

957
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,080
If he's masturbating to nothing, I would consider it an evil.

958
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,720
Okay, fair.

959
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,320
Okay.

960
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,040
Yeah.

961
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,040
It's...

962
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:16,640
Dobson?

963
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,880
Dr. James Dobson in about 1987,

964
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,400
the quote appears to be,

965
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,120
it is my opinion that masturbation is not much of an issue with God.

966
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,000
It's a normal part of adolescence.

967
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,560
Indeed, Jesus did not mention it.

968
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,920
Jesus didn't mention a lot of things.

969
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,000
Well, yeah, but well, it's not insignificant,

970
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,920
nor does the Hebrew Bible talk about it.

971
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,760
The spilling of seed with Onan, from which we get Onanism,

972
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,080
the sin was not that he spilled the seed.

973
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:47,440
The sin was that he didn't have intercourse with his brother's widow.

974
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,760
So, I mean, the Catholic would say that reason would show us

975
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,280
that masturbation is disordered, that pornography is disordered,

976
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,080
because it takes a natural act, which is good,

977
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,440
and it thwarts the end of it.

978
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,040
That's why I use the example of...

979
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,280
What about a man who can't attract a woman?

980
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,360
He should spend his life, obviously, then.

981
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,680
Yes, because masturbation is not like urination.

982
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,960
It's not something you need to do,

983
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,840
or else you're going to become neurotic and die somehow.

984
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,280
You're not going to find anybody in the morgue

985
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,760
with a tag on their toe that says virgin or something.

986
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,160
I think it's a pornified culture that's given us this idea.

987
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,840
Let me say that the ideal life would involve none of this.

988
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,560
I am not preoccupied with the ideal life.

989
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,880
I am preoccupied with a good life.

990
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,880
As I often say, I am not interested in making saints.

991
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,720
I am interested in making good people.

992
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:42,640
And it is so hard to make good people in a post-communist,

993
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,520
post-Nazi world, post-Islamic...

994
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,760
It's not post yet, Islamic terrorist world.

995
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,080
I admit, I am preoccupied with real evil

996
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,680
rather than non-idyllic behavior.

997
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,080
I admit it. That's where I am...

998
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:02,240
And maybe to clarify my thought, which might make it more acceptable to you,

999
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,800
I would say that there are circumstances in which

1000
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,000
masturbating or even looking at pornography

1001
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,360
could be a less grave sin due to habit, due to immaturity.

1002
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,720
But see, even in secular culture, we make fun of masturbation.

1003
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,920
We don't seem to be proud of masturbation.

1004
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,080
Even atheists, there's this big move to stop being a cream puff

1005
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,440
and masturbating into a sock.

1006
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,640
And instead of that, control your sexual desire.

1007
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,600
You're not a dog to be neutered.

1008
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,320
You're someone who has mastery over your lower passions.

1009
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,080
So I have a desire for food.

1010
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,800
But if I eat like a pig, then this is going to be bad for my health

1011
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,560
and this would be the sin of gluttony.

1012
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,840
I could have the desire to masturbate.

1013
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,600
But the difference is you can eat.

1014
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,880
The man who cannot have any sex.

1015
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,400
No, you're equating orgasm with eating and it's not the same thing.

1016
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,200
You did.

1017
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,680
No, you're saying that I'm equating them to show that they're dissimilar

1018
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,680
in that if I don't eat, I die.

1019
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,160
But it sounds like what you're saying is, well,

1020
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,520
but the man who never has a woman,

1021
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,600
surely he should masturbate or else what?

1022
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,880
And I'm saying he's not going to die.

1023
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,720
He's not going to die.

1024
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:06,960
Right.

1025
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,160
And so I think the man should have mastery over that passion

1026
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,760
and use it appropriately.

1027
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,960
That's what I would say.

1028
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,920
Okay. Ideally, I agree with you.

1029
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,240
So one way that's important that I said that.

1030
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,720
Ideally, ideally, ideally.

1031
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,040
But as I said, like in the case of marriages,

1032
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,400
I want them to love each other.

1033
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:33,920
And by the way, let me just, this is not utterly germane to our debate here.

1034
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:40,160
But having spoken to so many couples for so many years,

1035
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:46,560
I have a phrase which is related to this.

1036
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,840
But not exactly this, but related.

1037
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,800
You should make love outside the bedroom

1038
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,560
and have sex inside the bedroom.

1039
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:56,640
I love it.

1040
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,240
But I think I know what you mean.

1041
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,160
Oh, I'm glad you love it.

1042
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,240
Well, it's if I'm ignoring my wife,

1043
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,640
if I'm not doing acts of kindness towards her throughout the day,

1044
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,040
then to expect to come together and be intimate

1045
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,240
in that most intimate of embraces is selfish.

1046
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,320
But I want to love my bride throughout the day, sacrifice for her.

1047
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,040
Right. But what I'm saying more than that.

1048
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:21,600
Okay.

1049
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,160
That, of course, I'm saying that, but I am saying more than that.

1050
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:34,240
I'm also saying that the bedroom might be a place for the non-holy to express itself.

1051
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,840
Because we, I believe, were created in God's image and animal's image.

1052
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:43,040
And if we, sex allows the animal under holy circumstances,

1053
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,600
which is matrimony for both Jews and Catholics,

1054
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:52,240
that the word for marriage in Hebrew, kiddushin, means holy.

1055
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,800
I mean, that is the whole Talmudic volumes on marriage.

1056
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:01,040
And sex is called kiddushin, which means kadoches.

1057
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,720
Many Catholics know it means holy.

1058
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,560
So I Schmuley Boteath is a bearded Orthodox rabbi.

1059
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,920
I don't know if you're familiar with him.

1060
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,800
And he wrote a book called Kosher Sex.

1061
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,200
His argument is as follows.

1062
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,040
And he's very anti-porn, very.

1063
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:30,800
His argument is anything that the couple, the married couple agrees to in the bedroom,

1064
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,320
they should do, that that's the place.

1065
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,480
And that's why he calls it Kosher Sex.

1066
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,600
It wasn't, by the way, universally received well among some religious Jews.

1067
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:47,360
I, your views are not all that different from many Orthodox Jews.

1068
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,720
Why was he opposed to pornography?

1069
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,440
