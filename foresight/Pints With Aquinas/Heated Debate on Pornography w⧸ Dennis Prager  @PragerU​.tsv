0	3080	Let's talk about the pornography thing.
3080	4080	Right.
4080	5080	Well, that was...
5080	6240	How did that go when you discussed it with Father Dave?
6240	8680	Well, you'll have to ask the people there.
8680	10920	I mean, I can only judge it from my perspective.
10920	12680	I thought it went terrific.
12680	16680	When I saw that clip of you in Exodus, I got the sense that you were a bit sidelined.
16680	17680	Or totally.
17680	22280	And if somebody who has a talk show, I wish that I could go back and rephrase things or
22280	23280	add some new ones to...
23280	24280	Well, that's correct.
24280	25280	That is exactly how I wrote a letter.
25280	28280	I hope you saw it.
28280	33380	It was the last thing I imagined being asked at an Exodus course with Jordan Peterson
33380	38160	and a bunch of scholars whom I adored, by the way.
38160	42880	Nevertheless, I should have...
42880	46040	I wish I had phrased it better.
46040	52920	It is what it is, and I phrased it better tonight without being untrue to myself.
52920	59520	And what I did not see, a big part of the problem, should I review this for your watchers,
59520	60520	listeners?
60520	61520	Review?
61520	65000	Review what happened so that they'll understand what we're talking about.
65000	66720	So I...
66720	71760	The Daily Wire asked me to join Jordan Peterson, or Jordan Peterson asked me to Jordan...
71760	75920	Or both of them asked, because he's doing the book of...
75920	77200	Did the book of Exodus?
77200	82000	They were, I believe, 16 sessions of 90 minutes each.
82000	85720	That's a lot, a lot of time, with no commercials.
85720	87720	How many days did you film this in?
87720	88720	Oh, eight days.
88720	89720	Eight days.
89720	92680	Yes, eight days each time in Miami.
92680	94680	And it was wonderful.
94680	95920	I loved it.
95920	102640	So what arose at one time, and I've even forgotten about this, it was five minutes out of...
102640	108040	Let's see, what is 16 times an hour and a half, 24 hours.
108040	111520	So it's five minutes out of 24 hours.
111960	118640	What happened was, I don't even remember how the issue arose, but I mentioned that there
118640	124520	is a Jewish-Christian difference with regard to Jesus' statement that a man who lost after
124520	127840	another woman has committed adultery with his heart.
127840	133720	That A, that phrase does not appear, obviously, in the Hebrew Bible, but B, that the general
133720	139600	Jewish view, and I say general because I can't speak for all Jews, even though I try to be
139600	149000	normative, is that you can only commit adultery with, and I said this in the video, and I
149000	153480	purposely said, I'm not trying at all to be cute in any way.
153480	158560	You can only commit adultery with one organ and it is not the heart.
158560	162360	Judaism is very behavior-based.
162360	166520	Christianity is more...
166520	173680	It's not that it's not behavior-based, but it is equally, if not more, thought, inner-self,
173680	176680	heart-based.
176680	181600	So for example, there's a phrase in Hebrew that I learned very early in my Yeshiva education.
181600	185120	I'll say it in Hebrew so that people will know I didn't make it up.
185120	189680	Oh, ha'mah shavah, yikar el ha'mah, say it is not the thought that counts, that, no, not
189680	194320	that counts, that is the essence, but the deed.
194320	197240	Judaism is very behavior-ist, and I am very behavior-ist.
197240	204280	So for example, and I mention this at Franciscan, I've said on the radio very often, I don't
204280	208800	care if you like Jews, I don't care if you dislike Jews, I prefer you like Jews, but
208800	212920	there are a lot of Jews I don't like, I mean it's just a little silly to say I like a whole
212920	217720	group, there's no whole group I like, there's no whole group I dislike, but in any event,
217720	222200	I don't care if you dislike Jews, I care how you treat Jews.
222200	232720	And that is, it goes to the essence of what my belief is, I want to know how you act.
232720	241080	The left does this all the time, oh, you treat gays beautifully, like in my case, my wife
241080	247240	and I are godparents to a gay couple's children, but the fact that I'm against a same-sex marriage,
247240	248520	that makes me a hater.
248520	255120	So how I treat gays is irrelevant, it's what I think.
255120	260600	This bothers me that your thoughts can be regarded as a demerit.
260600	264760	But see, your thoughts wouldn't be uncharitable towards people with same-sex attraction, you
264760	270280	would just think that the behavior is presumably sinful.
270280	273200	So they would be wrong in their thinking of you as a homophobe.
273560	280760	Bothers me the most is that we redefine marriage.
280760	285160	My Leviticus commentary comes out, that'll be the fifth of my five-volume commentary
285160	292400	on the Torah, I have already written 22,000 words on one verse, which of course I've never
292400	299040	done for any other verse about a man shall not lie with a man as with a woman.
299040	306360	And so without even getting into that, the point I wanted to make was, for the left,
306360	311160	what I think renders me awful, not what I do.
311160	318680	So my treatment of gays is excellent, but the fact that I don't think marriage should
318680	324320	be redefined is enough to make me a hater, bigot, homophobe, and all the other terms
324320	325320	that they use.
325320	327040	Anyway, back to us.
327040	330160	Let me interject here.
330160	335240	So Aristotle in the Nicomachean Ethics has these four levels of the vicious to the virtuous
335240	336240	man.
336240	340360	The vicious man is the one who wants to do evil and does it, and he has the incontinent
340360	344280	man, the continent man, but he says the virtuous man is the one who wants to do the good and
344280	345360	does it.
345360	352640	And so to me, I have children, if one of them held anti-Semitic views but treated you kindly,
352640	358120	I would say, well, that's better than holding anti-Semitic views and being bad toward you,
358120	359120	but I wouldn't.
359120	360960	I would think that's not where I would settle.
360960	361960	I would want him to...
361960	362960	That's fine.
362960	363960	That's fine.
363960	364960	I respect that.
364960	370800	And I also want to say that I think I agree with you that obviously adultery and lust
370800	371800	are different things.
371800	374760	If they weren't different things, we wouldn't have two separate words for them.
374760	375760	Right?
375760	376760	Yeah.
376880	385000	Which comes somewhat of a revelation to my Christian friends is there is no sin of the...
385000	389160	There are 613 laws in the Torah, none of them say do not lust.
389160	390360	You can't covet.
390360	393880	Covet is a very different concept than lust.
393880	397680	Covet means you want to take what belongs to another, and it is a very simple proof
397680	399120	that it doesn't mean lust.
399120	405080	Covet, you don't lust after a house or a donkey, one presumes, and yet you're not allowed
405080	406560	to covet those either.
406560	409760	So do you make a distinction between sexual desire and lust?
409760	410760	Do you see a distinction?
410760	411760	No, I don't.
411760	412760	Okay.
412760	415800	So therefore, if you don't see a distinction between those two things, I can see why you
415800	417560	would think it insane to tell somebody they shouldn't lust.
417560	421960	I don't know how you sexually desire your wife and have no lust for her.
421960	423560	Oh, I do.
423560	424560	Okay.
424560	425560	So I would think that...
425560	426560	That's interesting.
426560	427560	I would think that lust...
427560	428560	So you think so lust...
428560	429560	Okay.
429560	430560	Yeah, you're right.
430560	431560	This is interesting.
431560	432560	I've never confronted it quite this way.
432560	433560	So lust is...
433560	435560	Lust reduces the subject to an object.
435560	440480	It subordinates the dignity of the person to the good of a selfish pleasure.
440480	443440	It's also a distorted sexual act.
443440	451560	So it's an act which is contrary to human nature or to the end of the sexual act.
451560	457000	So if sexual desire and lust are different, can you sexually desire a woman you're not
457000	458800	married to and not lust for her?
458800	459800	Yes.
459800	460800	Oh.
460800	461800	I would think so.
461800	462800	Okay.
462800	463800	I haven't heard that from a Christian before.
463840	466160	Three stages, if I would think of it.
466160	470560	If I board an airplane and I sit next to a beautiful woman and I'm attracted to her
470560	472680	sexually, how could I not be?
472680	473680	Okay.
473680	474680	That's beyond my control.
474680	479040	Now, the next step could be, now what do I do with that?
479040	482080	Do I sit here and fantasize about what I could do with her sexually?
482080	486600	At that point, the will is engaged and that is something within my control.
486600	490520	So I think it is important to make that distinction and I think that might be part of what drives
490520	496240	some Christians neurotic if they think, well, sexual desire is a sin, can't sexually desire
496240	498240	anybody who isn't my wife.
498240	505360	Not only Christians, but I think in some cases with Jews too, that it does drive people
505360	506360	to be neurotic.
506360	508920	It's like if I said you don't think of a pink elephant.
508920	510920	Well, better.
510920	515760	You're in a restaurant, don't think of food because that's a real life.
515760	516760	Very bad.
516760	517760	Stop it.
517760	518760	Yeah.
518760	519760	You'd go crazy.
520000	522160	The more you don't think about it, the more you think about it.
522160	524480	So there's that element too.
524480	525480	Agreed.
525480	532600	So I differ with you and I did with the father and by the way, I mentioned this is very important
532600	533600	to note.
533600	538600	What a credit it is to Franciscan University A having me, A as a religious Jew obviously
538600	545840	doesn't believe in Christ, not a Christian, and B that they discuss openly with me at
545840	551200	the university what they heard me say on Daily Wire.
551200	556960	But he did raise this issue about sexual objectification and that reduces the human
556960	563200	being as one created God's image, et cetera, just what you said now.
563200	567360	And I have a different view of that.
567360	568360	Sure.
568360	573920	I think this, I suspect you may have not heard this before in one of your podcasts.
573920	574920	Here we go.
574920	576640	Here's one of your guests.
576640	584840	I think that in the bedroom, if a loving husband who is a loving husband and I have
584840	590280	a word to say about what a loving husband is, a loving husband who sees his wife in
590280	596520	the bedroom as a sexual object, I will be totally open with you.
596520	602680	I have said on the radio, if after X number of years married, your husband still sees
602680	606440	you as a sex object, you are both very lucky.
606440	608600	I would say it depends what you mean by sex object.
608600	612480	If what you mean is your husband continues to find you sexually desirable, I would agree
612480	613600	with you.
613600	619280	If what you mean is the man essentially treats his wife as a warm body to masturbate in, not
619280	623080	taking into account her feelings, her desires.
623080	624400	Oh, of course.
624400	630800	But that's not objectification as a dirty meme.
630800	636320	He said, the father said, one shouldn't even objectivize baseball players.
636320	637720	And it was an excellent analogy.
637720	639420	I had thought of that myself.
639420	641600	But I do objectivize the baseball player.
641600	643320	I'm not sure if I agree with him.
643320	648520	But it doesn't mean that you would automatically mistreat the baseball player.
648520	649520	That's right.
649520	652240	But I'm in a different relationship with the baseball player than I am with the one I
652240	653240	married to.
653240	654240	Correct.
654240	655240	But there is a place in the totality of a relationship.
655240	659400	So here is my motto because I talk about men and women every week for an hour on my radio
659400	661880	show and I have for about 20 years.
661880	667880	And that is you make love outside the bedroom and you have sex inside the bedroom.
667880	673760	I think it's a romanticization of the sex act to say that it's always making love.
673760	676040	It's OK to make lust.
676040	678520	It's OK to have some objectification.
678520	680760	That doesn't mean you're mistreating her.
680760	683120	Yeah, I think I'd want to know what you mean by objectification.
683120	687520	Because I had the sense that you're using language to convey something that I might agree with.
687520	688520	Yes, you might.
688520	689520	You really might.
689520	690520	I agree with you.
690520	692120	It certainly doesn't mean mistreat.
692120	693740	It's not even implied.
693740	697440	But any more than with the baseball player.
697440	701080	And you'll say, well, I have a different relationship with the baseball player, but you're right.
701080	703080	Sex is its own world.
703080	706080	I don't like to romanticize sex.
706080	710040	Sex is many, many things.
710040	711480	Sometimes it's love.
711480	713120	Sometimes it's just pure sex.
713120	717800	When it's pure sex and not just love, there is an element of objectification.
718280	721480	I'm crazy about her legs.
721480	724080	Is that a statement of love?
724080	724520	What do you mean?
724520	725640	You don't love legs.
725640	726520	What do you mean by love?
726520	726720	Right.
726720	732480	So I would say Aristotle and Aquinas would say that to love is to will the good of the other for their sake.
732480	734640	So I don't will my wife's good for my sake.
734640	738560	It's not like I say, honey, I really need you to go to CrossFit so I can lust after you.
738560	739440	Well, what?
739440	741920	But if I want her to get healthy for her sake, then this is love.
741920	747160	But if she says to you, honey, there's a certain thing that you could do for me sexually
747200	748920	that will really turn me on.
748920	750960	And it may not really turn you on.
750960	755400	Are you being objectivized or are you doing it because you love her and because she wants it?
755400	759640	Well, first of all, she's asked a question in which I presumably am free to decline as she.
759640	762680	Oh, if she's not free to decline, that's coercion.
762680	763680	And there's no room for that.
763680	766640	Right. So there is an objectification of coercion or not the same thing.
766640	768040	Which I'm free to decline.
768040	772560	Right. So, honey, would you put on this sexy outfit for me?
772560	773720	Are you OK with that?
773720	775280	Me? Yeah.
775320	777520	Buddy, hell, that's a question I didn't expect you to ask me.
777520	778520	Well, you opened it up.
780840	782480	I would not be OK with that.
782480	783680	That's interesting. I don't think.
783680	785200	Even in the bedroom.
785200	787560	It's not that I'd be morally opposed to it.
787560	790520	It's just that I'd feel uncomfortable with it.
790520	795560	Well, my view is that the more comfort the couple has, the better the relationship.
795560	796560	I think that's right.
796560	801640	So long as comfort doesn't lead to what I would consider to be sexually perverse acts.
801640	805200	Well, why is it sexually perverse to wear a sexy outfit?
805200	807800	It's not. And that's why I said I'm not morally opposed to it.
807800	810800	But if you're saying that the discomfort is personal, that's fair.
810800	813200	I that's not an area I need to get into.
813200	816400	One thing I would love you to get into, because you did say this in the email,
816400	821520	is you think that the widespread proliferation of property is destroying teenagers.
821520	825360	Help help help help people hear this side of what I given.
825360	826560	I gave an example tonight.
826560	828360	So I'm very friendly with a young woman.
828360	830760	She's 23, very, very close to her.
831120	835600	People could guess who it is, because I do a podcast with her.
836280	837800	So she is so open.
837800	838520	God bless her.
838520	842080	I don't think she would object to my to my telling this story.
843320	846200	In fact, maybe it was even discussed on one of our podcasts.
846200	847920	We're very, very open.
847920	852480	So she was on a date and they were both a track.
852480	854520	It was not the first date and they kissed.
854520	856480	It's all they did. They kissed.
856480	859760	And in the midst of the kiss, he he grabbed her neck.
860280	862280	Oh, like this.
862280	864440	And even me, Mr.
864440	866880	Open was taken aback.
867680	870800	And and so was she to her credit.
871360	877080	She when she took his hand away, she said either then or later
877080	879360	that evening or later another time.
879800	881680	Why did you do that?
881680	885680	And he to his credit was open enough to say, I thought you would like it.
885960	888000	That's what I see on the Internet.
889000	892360	That's a bad thing that that's that's
893840	899120	the number of young men who learn about women through porn
899120	903400	and not real life is a very scary thing that has developed.
903800	907080	So I am I am as worried as you are
907880	910440	about the pornification of society.
911040	914760	When I answered the question that Jordan Peterson asked,
914760	916760	which came out of nowhere, I'm not blaming him in the least.
916800	919160	It was a perfectly legit question, but it came out of nowhere.
919720	924640	I was thinking still in the way I have always defined it as Playboy magazine.
925280	928280	That to me, that was porn.
928280	932360	The stuff that is out there now is not what I think of when I'm asked the question.
933000	937760	And and so I did say this to the father tonight,
937880	940040	and I'm sure it shocked everybody there.
940040	941440	Did you ask it? No, keep going.
942080	943240	Make a bad you'll get it.
943240	946560	You'll get a charge out of this intellectually.
946640	948360	It'll blow your mind, I think.
948360	951480	So my dad was an Orthodox Jew, a modern Orthodox, admittedly,
951480	955560	but Orthodox did never drove on the Sabbath, never ate a non kosher food.
955600	958400	Wariamolka and the house sent the kids to Yeshiva.
958680	961320	I mean, he was the real deal.
961320	964160	He was the president of the Kingsway Jewish Center.
964160	967160	Still exists an Orthodox synagogue in Brooklyn, New York.
968040	973320	And he subscribed to Playboy, which shocks Jews as well as non-Jews, to be honest.
973320	974880	Good. OK. Yeah.
975200	977640	Glad that it does. Yes. OK.
977640	981920	However, so I I I was raised in a very sexually open home
981920	985960	that was also deeply religious, and I never found them conflicting
986920	988520	as he didn't.
988520	990440	And so he was an outlier.
990440	992280	I acknowledge and I am an outlier.
992280	993320	I acknowledge.
993320	998760	However, I want people to understand my parents were together 72 years
999560	1003560	and they loved each other crazy when she died at eighty nine.
1003600	1005600	He died at ninety six.
1005600	1008880	He basically his life ended.
1009920	1012640	His screensaver was I love you, Hindi.
1012640	1013800	That was his nickname for her.
1013800	1017960	Her name was Hilda, and she knew he got Playboy.
1018360	1021400	This did not did not trouble my mother.
1021400	1023280	Oh, that's Mac. OK.
1023280	1026800	I'm married to a live wire who was faithful and who loved me.
1027160	1028760	And she was crazy about him.
1028760	1030800	And that and that and that was it.
1030800	1032680	What would be better for your father
1032680	1035920	to love your mother and get Playboy or for your father to say,
1035920	1038120	even though I'm tempted to look at pornography,
1038480	1041840	my wife's body is enough for me and I'm not going to look at that,
1041840	1044440	even though I'm tempted to. That's a very fair question.
1045880	1051520	I don't have an answer, which will I should give you the answer you want.
1051800	1054040	I think you should, too. Yes, that's a good point.
1054040	1058040	You do. I don't know what that means enough.
1059360	1061360	As I said, which bothers is funny.
1061360	1062800	There were two groups that it bothers.
1062800	1066320	The very religious and the radical feminist.
1066760	1071640	When I say that men are variety built in,
1071640	1076080	God made male sexual nature as variety oriented as one.
1076880	1079120	I don't know who put it this way, but one would put it.
1079880	1082160	A woman loves a man and men love women.
1082680	1084800	Now, I don't want men to go around loving women.
1084880	1086280	I'm totally opposed to that.
1086280	1091400	I am I am and insist on my being.
1091400	1094360	It's not it's not even debatable that I am faithful to my wife.
1094360	1096080	It's a given.
1096080	1099200	My wife knows that other women are a turn on.
1099640	1101560	She knows it. It does not bother her.
1101920	1105760	She she is she to my luck.
1106280	1110680	I am married to a woman who does not find male sexual nature frightening.
1110920	1113600	Most women do. And by the way, I understand that.
1113600	1115160	But again, I think we have to make the distinction
1115160	1119960	between sexual arousal and sitting and fantasizing or watching.
1120400	1122280	Actually, they looked at it together.
1122280	1124600	And if you. Well, that's sad, too, I think.
1124640	1125920	I don't. Why is it said?
1125920	1129680	Because I think pornography is a version of the sexual act.
1129680	1131320	Yeah. Well, OK, which is holy.
1131320	1132520	What if they looked OK?
1132520	1135400	Let me finish, which is God's first commandment to humanity.
1135400	1137040	Be fruitful and multiply.
1137040	1140080	It is the most intimate thing two human beings can do together.
1140200	1141160	Not watch the office.
1141160	1142840	No, not go for a walk on the beach.
1142840	1144960	It's the fundamental act that brings about the family,
1144960	1146560	which brings about society.
1146560	1149640	I'm of the opinion that if you pervert that fundamental I don't know why.
1149640	1151640	It's why. Why is it perverted?
1151640	1155880	Why is it because it usurps the natural end of sexual intercourse?
1156080	1159720	If I eat food and then force myself to throw up, I'm usurping.
1160040	1162920	OK, but I don't think that that it's a fair analogy.
1162920	1164360	Let's say they look very fair.
1164360	1167960	Let's say they looked at at bathing suit ads, not at Playboy.
1168960	1172480	Just they looked at that other beautiful women together that that.
1173200	1174600	And it was OK with my mother.
1174640	1177640	Obviously, the assumption is it was OK with my mother.
1177640	1179840	If it wasn't, then it's not a good thing. Clearly.
1182520	1188240	I am more worried about men having to hide their nature.
1188840	1191360	See, when you say God has built into their nature,
1191360	1194560	a desire for variety, it sounds like you're saying that therefore
1194560	1197000	it would be unnatural to not look at pornography.
1197400	1200000	Well, forget the word pornography because it's so loaded.
1200000	1201720	I'm anti pornography.
1201720	1204760	But if pornography means anything that is arousing,
1204760	1206600	then it could be a bra ad. Right.
1206600	1209440	Well, I think I could define pornography like this.
1209440	1213400	I could say material which depicts a rotec behavior.
1213400	1214760	That's not behavior.
1214760	1216920	There's no behavior in Playboy. OK.
1217120	1218080	Well, it's not behavior.
1218080	1219600	I think that's an important distinction.
1219600	1222760	I think what when you say behavior, I think you're meaning video or.
1222960	1225800	No, I didn't. That's why that's why I read.
1226040	1229840	Then no, I don't I'm I am not
1229840	1233720	advocate of watching sexual behavior, but I want to know what you mean
1233720	1236200	by the word behavior, because if I'm going to say it's sexual,
1236200	1238400	sexual activity between two people.
1238400	1241680	OK, so even a photograph in Playboy of two people engaging in it.
1241680	1243560	But there weren't such when I.
1243560	1245320	That's when you were opposed to that,
1245320	1247960	but you're OK with a man looking at one naked woman, let's say.
1247960	1250160	Yes, or they weren't even naked then.
1250160	1252760	They were covered in their privates.
1252760	1254440	Right. But but you're opposed to them
1254480	1256720	looking at anything that might be arousing.
1256720	1259600	You're what if a woman is wearing a regular
1260280	1262840	what if a man is turned on, which every man is,
1263000	1265200	by an attractive woman in a nice dress?
1265480	1267640	That's a turn on. So no, no, no, please answer.
1267920	1269840	So is that bad?
1269840	1270920	I'm going to add his wife.
1270920	1273480	I'm going to answer, but let me unfold this a little bit.
1273920	1277400	I think pornography can sometimes be a difficult thing to define.
1277600	1280120	I would say, and let me see if I can redefine it for you,
1280280	1281880	material that depicts
1282280	1288520	something that's intended to sexually arouse or replace replace a prostitute.
1288520	1290800	I mean, the word pornography comes from two Greek words,
1290800	1293920	porne graph pain, which means the writing or the drawing of the prostitutes.
1294240	1296600	It's meant to serve an erotic function.
1297200	1300680	And so what if the but what if the eroticism is then is then.
1300680	1303120	So I'm OK with the wife.
1303120	1306520	I'm OK looking at breasts and I'm OK looking at bums.
1307080	1309400	And I if you go to the Sistine Chapel,
1309480	1312280	you'll see that Catholics are perfectly comfortable with nudity.
1312480	1315640	But I think that nudity can be presented in a way
1315840	1318440	that upholds and expresses the dignity of the person.
1318520	1322240	So I could say, OK, I could look at that and marvel at God's creation
1322240	1324320	and the beauty of woman and the beauty of man.
1324320	1327680	But I think I could also look at a lingerie catalog
1327880	1331600	and in my mind treat this person as a mere object.
1331600	1333800	So I would say
1334320	1337560	that in one aspect I'm OK looking at breasts, let's say, Sistine Chapel.
1337760	1340880	But in another sense, if I'm looking at a lingerie catalog
1340880	1343040	with the intention of lusting it, that wouldn't be OK.
1343040	1345640	What if I'm looking at the lingerie catalog
1345640	1347880	with the intention of getting my wife lingerie?
1347880	1350640	I think the intention does matter. Yeah.
1350640	1351520	OK. All right.
1351520	1353440	Yeah. We're not that far.
1353440	1354920	I'm not advocating this.
1354920	1355680	I know you're not.
1355680	1356920	And I really want that to get.
1356920	1358960	Yeah, yes, it's very important.
1358960	1360840	But I I'm so worried.
1361680	1365520	Remember, I come from the woman calling my show.
1365960	1369160	I saw I saw pictures on my husband's computer.
1369160	1370600	I'm devastated.
1370600	1372440	So what am I supposed to say?
1372440	1373840	You know what?
1373840	1375240	You're right to be devastated.
1375240	1377040	Your husband is a real sinner.
1377040	1378600	He treats you as an object.
1378600	1380040	What would you like me to say to her?
1380040	1381960	Here's what I'd like you to say.
1381960	1383040	I think you could.
1383040	1385120	I don't think you have to say.
1386280	1389040	I think I would I think I would begin by validating her pain.
1389040	1390560	I wouldn't dismiss it by.
1390560	1391520	And I'm not saying you did this
1391520	1392920	because I haven't heard this sort of phone call.
1392920	1394200	But I wouldn't dismiss it by saying
1394200	1396480	you're wrong to be hurt.
1396480	1399720	I would say there are many things out there
1399720	1403200	that your husband, I'm sure, loves you very much.
1403200	1404880	Well, that's my first question to her.
1404880	1405520	And you're right.
1405520	1407760	This is does he love you and is he loving
1407760	1409400	and do you have a good love life?
1409400	1409960	And I yeah.
1409960	1412400	And this is what I'll be if the answers are all.
1412400	1413280	Yes, go on.
1413280	1414760	So if the answers are all, yes, I would say, well,
1414760	1417720	since he loves you and since this bothers you,
1417720	1419720	there are some excellent resources
1419720	1421680	that I'd love to tell you about
1421680	1423800	that could help him be free of pornography.
1423840	1426600	Because surely you would say if a man is looking at pornography
1426600	1428720	and his wife's heartbroken, you're not saying, well,
1428720	1431080	she's wrong to be and he doesn't need to change.
1431080	1433200	If she's heartbroken, wouldn't you want to say to the man,
1433200	1434760	here are some ways that you could quit?
1434760	1436960	Yes, I would want to say to both of them.
1438880	1441480	I understand why your heartbroken
1441480	1445400	because you think that he loves her more than you
1445400	1446760	or as much as you.
1446760	1449160	And I want you to know that's not the case at all.
1449160	1451480	I don't know if that's the only reason she'd be heartbroken.
1451480	1453520	I don't think it's that she loves.
1453560	1457480	I think that pornography trains us in selfishness.
1457480	1458560	Yes, so.
1458560	1460880	It also legitimizes.
1460880	1462440	So a lot of he says to her, well, look,
1462440	1465800	you saw lingerie ads and I'm dying to buy you
1465800	1469120	some really cute lingerie.
1469120	1470800	Would you be okay with that?
1470800	1473080	I would say that we're verging on what's sometimes called
1473080	1474520	the fallacy of the beard.
1474520	1475640	You ever heard of this?
1475640	1477880	Just because you don't know when something begins,
1477880	1480240	it doesn't mean you can't say what a thing is.
1480240	1481480	This isn't a beard.
1481480	1483240	But in the three months, if I didn't shave,
1483240	1484840	it would be and just because you don't know
1484840	1487600	when it started doesn't mean you can't say what a beard is.
1487600	1489880	And I would say that there are blurry lines.
1489880	1490920	I would agree with you.
1490920	1492920	Like a Victoria's Secret fashion show.
1492920	1493760	Is that pornography?
1493760	1496240	I'd say probably, what about,
1496240	1499000	but is it less bad than other forms of pornography?
1499000	1499840	Yes.
1499840	1501480	Not all pornography is equal.
1501480	1503800	Some pornography can be far more ratchet than others.
1503800	1505440	We're really not that far apart.
1505880	1510880	I, my biggest, one of my biggest teachings
1513360	1515280	is that there are levels of sin
1515280	1517520	and there are levels of good.
1517520	1521360	And that we should not listen.
1521360	1523240	I don't think this is not a Catholic thing,
1523240	1525480	but many Protestants who listen to my show
1526480	1528960	take issue with me when I say
1528960	1533960	that God does not regard stealing a stapler from the office
1534520	1537240	as he does child molestation.
1537240	1539400	And they call me up and say, Dennis, love you,
1539400	1541840	but I gotta tell you, a sin is a sin.
1541840	1544360	Yeah, no, we would part ways with our...
1544360	1545200	I know you would.
1545200	1546040	Yes, I know.
1546040	1549840	I said Catholics and Jews believe in gradations of sin.
1549840	1550680	Correct, okay.
1550680	1553640	So there are gradations in that arena as well.
1553640	1556760	Yes, but I would say that just because something is less bad
1556760	1558840	than something else, it doesn't make it good.
1558840	1559680	So if you're saying to the...
1559680	1560720	Okay, I'm not arguing it's good.
1560720	1561560	So if you say to the...
1561560	1563280	I'm arguing it's not as bad
1563560	1565960	as people often make it out to be.
1565960	1567840	I am not arguing that it's good.
1569160	1571680	In an ideal marriage with my father,
1571680	1573440	not have subscribed to Playboy,
1573440	1575760	I'll be prepared to say yes, however.
1575760	1576600	Look at you, good job.
1576600	1580080	Yes, yeah, but it doesn't gain you as much as you think
1580080	1583040	because I saw their relationship for seven,
1583040	1584960	I didn't see it for 72 years, obviously,
1584960	1587880	but I saw it for the bulk of their life.
1587880	1591800	And the respect with which he treated her.
1591800	1592640	I'm sure he did.
1592640	1594200	I'm not making the claim that you have
1594200	1597200	pure pristine holy marriage and haven of filth.
1597200	1599040	I'm not saying that those are only two options.
1599040	1601080	Right, okay, so fine, so there are degrees.
1601080	1603040	But if you're saying to the woman,
1603040	1606200	better for him to look at porn than to commit adultery,
1606200	1608000	then what I would say there is,
1608000	1610920	it might be less bad, all things being equal,
1610920	1612800	but less bad doesn't make it good.
1612800	1614960	And if adultery can be analogized
1614960	1617000	to shooting your marriage in the head,
1617000	1619480	I would say pornography is the slow poisoning of it
1619480	1621840	and that there's a great deal of research
1621840	1623720	to be able to back that up.
1623720	1624840	Yes, well.
1624840	1628080	In fact, Dennis, I'm gonna get your book on Exodus.
1628080	1629840	I promise to look at it.
1629840	1631280	This is my book on pornography.
1631280	1634040	It's a non-religious response to pro-porn arguments.
1634040	1635200	Oh yeah, I'll be very happy to read it.
1635200	1636720	And I'll sign it so it'll be worth more
1636720	1638680	in the garage sale one day.
1638680	1641840	But there's no talk of sin, there's no scripture verses.
1641840	1644920	It's all based on the 40 plus years of science
1644920	1647400	that's coming out of academia from neuroscience.
1647400	1648640	So here's the question.
1648640	1651160	Okay, so you see, the reason I actually
1651160	1652480	never talk about pornography.
1652480	1653920	He asked me, you were asked me.
1653920	1654760	This is your news.
1654760	1656840	I never do, I certainly don't advocate it.
1657920	1660880	I don't even discuss it, let alone advocate it.
1660880	1665240	But it was asked, and I sort of took a vow many years ago,
1665240	1666960	I won't avoid questions.
1666960	1669640	I wish I had known in advance it would be discussed.
1669640	1671920	I would have said how much I'm horrified
1671920	1674160	by the pornification of society, et cetera.
1675040	1680040	But we, I want to, we're on so many different,
1682800	1684440	related but different tracks.
1684440	1686520	And it's a very important subject.
1693880	1697840	Oh yes, I was influenced by my parents' marriage.
1697840	1699760	We're all influenced by our parents' marriage.
1699760	1701440	If you see your father beat your mother,
1701440	1704120	you think that's normal and you end up beating your wife.
1704360	1705560	Of course, my father, I mean,
1705560	1707440	the thought that he would ever lift it,
1707440	1710360	he wouldn't, it's so inconceivable to me.
1710360	1712720	All he did was tell his sons
1712720	1714640	how much he loved their mother.
1714640	1715880	I mean, constantly.
1717200	1720480	So what I saw was a man got Playboy
1720480	1723920	and loved his wife for 72 years.
1723920	1727120	She knew he got Playboy and loved her husband
1727120	1729600	and knew he loved her for 72 years.
1729600	1732680	So that's what I saw.
1732720	1736440	And I'm not going to sit here as their child
1736440	1739920	and say, this was really awful.
1739920	1743560	When I can't say it because I would be lying.
1743560	1746280	But if you ask me, is there an ideal?
1746280	1749080	I will argue, okay, there is an ideal.
1749080	1753200	But the human condition is messy.
1753200	1758200	So back to our earlier question,
1758480	1761800	where we differ on can a loving husband
1761840	1766840	in the bedroom ever see his wife as a sex object?
1767520	1769680	And I said, that's good.
1769680	1770800	See, that's there.
1770800	1772760	Finally, we have a real difference.
1772760	1774600	I actually think that is a positive.
1774600	1777680	I don't know if we do have a disagreement.
1777680	1779520	If by sex object, you mean
1779520	1781600	you find your wife sexually desirable.
1781600	1783520	I don't know what the difference is.
1783520	1784360	What's the difference?
1784360	1785560	I think this is what I would say, right?
1785560	1788200	As subject, like man is made
1788200	1790720	and man makes his own ends, right?
1790760	1792840	Slavery is wrong because we take a man
1792840	1796360	who makes his own ends and would like to fulfill them.
1798040	1799720	When I talk about objectification,
1799720	1802000	I guess I'm talking about a sort of evacuation
1802000	1804440	of the subject of the person.
1804440	1805840	I'm not concerned about her.
1805840	1807680	I'm not concerned about her.
1807680	1810000	You draw an inference that I'm not implying.
1810000	1812400	And that's why I say I don't know if we're disagreeing.
1812400	1813240	We may not.
1813240	1814360	That would be great to resolve it.
1814360	1816800	I'm totally happy with that if that happens.
1817640	1822640	How you treat her is not that you will treat her badly.
1824760	1828800	The moment women don't say I'm crazy
1828800	1831360	about my husband's legs, okay?
1831360	1833920	But a man may not say it.
1833920	1834760	Well, that's true.
1834760	1835760	Fair enough.
1835760	1840680	Okay, I'll ask your wife, okay.
1841640	1846640	But every man thinks that way
1846840	1848560	if there's a part of her body
1848560	1851840	that is particularly a turn on to use the term do him.
1851840	1853520	That is objectification.
1853520	1855080	Women don't do that.
1855080	1858240	Women don't, very, I mean, young women do.
1858240	1859600	Oh, he's got a great butt.
1859600	1862040	By objectification, do you mean I find a part
1862040	1864800	of my wife's body that I find attractive sexually?
1864800	1865640	Yeah.
1865640	1866480	Yeah, all right.
1866480	1869800	I suppose that for me, objectification means
1871320	1874200	sort of subordinating the good of my wife
1874200	1875520	to a selfish pleasure.
1875520	1880360	You have drawn a behavioral inference from a thought
1880360	1881200	and I don't.
1881200	1882040	Yeah.
1882040	1883640	But see, I still am not convinced
1883640	1887080	that this sharp distinction or the distinction,
1887080	1889120	because I've heard Ben Shapiro say something similar.
1889120	1890680	And so I don't know if this is,
1890680	1893320	as you say, more of a behaviorist, kind of Jewish idea,
1893320	1894320	because I think he said something like,
1894320	1896200	I don't really care if you have racist thoughts.
1896200	1897240	I care about how you act.
1897240	1898080	That's right.
1898080	1899080	I said that to the group tonight.
1899080	1900640	I don't care if people dislike Jews.
1900640	1901680	I care how they treat us.
1901680	1902880	But if my son or daughter.
1902880	1903840	I know you're right.
1903840	1905640	I would tell the same to my child.
1905640	1907760	If my child said, I don't like this group.
1907760	1910880	But I think this is what our Lord Jesus Christ is doing,
1910880	1912840	in which he's saying your righteousness
1912840	1914760	has to pass out of the Pharisees.
1914760	1919760	It's not enough that you don't murder.
1920360	1921720	You should not want to.
1921720	1923800	It's not enough that you don't commit adultery.
1923800	1926880	You should not say fuel the flame
1926880	1928840	that could lead to that.
1928840	1930320	I happen to think it's a good thing
1930320	1931200	not to want to murder.
1931200	1932680	I subscribe to that.
1934080	1937920	But there's a very interesting Hebrew phrase
1938920	1940160	translating from the Hebrew.
1940160	1942160	So it'll be a bit awkward.
1942160	1946160	In the place that a penitent stands,
1946160	1948960	the most righteous person doesn't stand.
1948960	1951920	And I extrapolate from that,
1951920	1956920	that if you have bad thoughts and don't act on them,
1957460	1959200	you're on a higher moral plane
1959200	1961240	than the guy who never has a bad thought.
1961240	1964000	I don't get any credit for not molesting children.
1964000	1966280	I'm as interested in children sexually
1966280	1969320	as I am in bananas or peach trees.
1970680	1973600	So I get no credit for not molesting a child.
1973600	1977280	But the sick dude who does want to and doesn't,
1977280	1978840	he gets a lot of credit.
1978840	1981120	So speaking of pedophilia,
1981960	1986960	suppose a man says, I view animated child porn.
1987960	1991320	So there's no real victim in that sense of child pornography,
1991320	1992960	which we both agree is horrendous.
1992960	1995360	And by viewing animated child porn,
1995360	1998040	it prevents me from acting out sexually on a child.
1998040	1999480	Now, I deny that.
1999480	2002240	I think that pornography inflames us
2002240	2004120	to then want to act those fantasies out.
2004120	2006280	And I think there's good studies that back that up.
2006280	2008200	But surely you wouldn't say to the man
2008200	2010480	who views animated child pornography,
2010480	2013040	that's not bad so long as you don't act it out.
2013040	2015120	Wouldn't you want to help this poor sick dude?
2015240	2016360	Yes, I would.
2016360	2018640	But I am thrilled that he's not acting it out.
2018640	2020080	I mean, of course.
2020080	2021480	Well, that's big.
2021480	2026480	We're both thrilled that he might have a poor substitute,
2026480	2029560	but it is a substitute if that were the case.
2029560	2031320	No child is being used.
2031320	2032840	It's all animated.
2033840	2035600	And he-
2035600	2037360	But would you use the word evil
2037360	2038720	of animated child pornography?
2038720	2040000	Because I certainly would.
2040000	2042280	No, I would use evil only with behavior.
2042280	2045400	That's where we might differ from forgetting the sex issue.
2045400	2047240	You can't be evil.
2047240	2049360	You didn't do evil if you thought evil.
2049360	2050200	You did evil if you committed-
2050200	2051960	If I'm masturbating to animated pictures of pornography,
2051960	2052960	I'm not doing something evil.
2052960	2053800	That's correct.
2053800	2056000	Yeah, I think that's despicable.
2056000	2056840	Yeah.
2056840	2057680	Really?
2057680	2058600	Yes, of course.
2058600	2059440	Who is being hurt?
2059440	2060600	You have to have a victim.
2060600	2063000	Oh, I'll tell you, there's at least two people being hurt.
2063000	2065160	There's the person who's poisoning himself
2065160	2066440	by encouraging him to think-
2066440	2067280	Yes, yes, you're right.
2067280	2068120	Acting out on children.
2068120	2069600	And there's also the animator-
2069600	2070440	Okay, wait a minute.
2070520	2074640	We both are aching for him not to have those fantasies.
2074640	2076080	I agree with you, but I-
2076080	2077040	But you won't call it evil.
2077040	2078880	I won't call a fantasy evil.
2080080	2082240	There's too much real evil on earth
2082240	2085840	for me to start being preoccupied with people's thinking.
2085840	2086840	It's not just thinking.
2086840	2088280	It's him masturbating to-
2088280	2089120	Yes, he's okay.
2089120	2093080	Okay, so the real question about the whole pornography issue
2093080	2095880	is not pornography, it's masturbation.
2095880	2097280	There was a Catholic tradition-
2097280	2098120	I disagree.
2098120	2099480	I think it's both.
2099520	2100960	I think both masturbation is evil,
2100960	2102280	but I think pornography is a greater evil, I would say.
2102280	2103880	Okay, so I don't think masturbation is evil.
2103880	2105880	Okay, that's, and by the way,
2105880	2108080	I admit that within Orthodox Judaism,
2108080	2112320	there is, when I was a counselor at Orthodox Jewish camp,
2112320	2114480	the kids were told by some of their rabbis
2114480	2117000	that masturbation is like murder.
2117000	2119560	And there was that, there was also that.
2119560	2120680	There's a statement like that.
2120680	2121880	I certainly wouldn't make that statement.
2121880	2124560	Okay, I do believe that in Catholic theology,
2124560	2125400	there is-
2125400	2126720	No, no, no.
2126720	2128120	No Catholic is saying that murder
2128120	2130160	is equivalent to masturbation.
2130160	2131000	Okay, all right, good.
2131000	2132640	You might say that both are grave sins,
2132640	2135120	but you wouldn't say that masturbation is a graver sin.
2135120	2136080	Even within murder,
2136080	2137600	patricide would be a graver sin
2137600	2138440	than killing a stranger.
2138440	2140960	So since we both believe murder is always wrong,
2140960	2142840	obviously self-defense is killing not murder,
2142840	2144760	so murder is always wrong.
2144760	2146760	Child molestation is always wrong.
2146760	2148720	Is masturbation always wrong?
2148720	2152360	What about a man whose wife, and I had this example,
2152360	2154560	now you may say, well, if you take an extreme example,
2154560	2155760	it's not fair.
2155800	2157600	But if you say always,
2157600	2160760	I have to take a real life example of a man I knew
2160760	2163520	who adored his wife.
2163520	2165280	I knew them when they were both Welsh.
2165280	2168520	She got Alzheimer's at a very early age in her 50s,
2168520	2170840	and he dressed her and bathed her
2170840	2173880	and cleaned her up for a decade.
2173880	2178880	And if this man, with a wife who no longer recognized him,
2179080	2181680	masturbated to get rid of his sexual tension
2181680	2184920	and stayed to take care of his wife,
2185920	2187200	you would say that was evil?
2187200	2189080	I would, because I think that evil
2189080	2191000	is the way things shouldn't be.
2191000	2194000	And I think the sexual act exists for union,
2194000	2198320	and to masturbate is to thwart the end of that natural act.
2198320	2202000	I also think that what we haven't taken into account yet
2202000	2204400	is an industry that brutalizes women
2204400	2206160	that's often involved in trafficking women.
2206160	2208040	Oh, that's why I said, I've against all of that.
2208040	2210080	I'm on your side on that.
2210080	2212280	Yes, I was talking about pictures,
2212280	2213920	still pictures of models.
2214720	2216760	But I'm still saying that this brutalizes women.
2216760	2220040	I think it's like, what woman would you like him to look at?
2220040	2223120	Like your wife, your daughter, my daughter?
2223120	2225320	Would you be comfortable with someone you know and love
2225320	2226920	being looked at like that?
2226920	2230040	I wouldn't. No, but it's, you're using,
2231840	2236080	you're bringing the emotional.
2236080	2237400	I would say you're doing that.
2237400	2240160	I think you're doing that when you use this story.
2240160	2242120	I would not deny that this is a virtuous man
2242160	2243680	in many respects, laudable,
2243680	2244920	who I could learn a great deal from.
2244920	2246520	Right, but no, no, you use the word evil.
2246520	2247360	That's right. That's right.
2247360	2249440	Okay, you define evil in a way I don't.
2249440	2251160	The way things shouldn't be, I would say.
2251160	2253560	And I would refer to natural evil.
2253560	2256240	So if a man is born blind, this is a natural evil.
2256240	2258800	If a stone is blind, this is not a natural evil.
2258800	2260800	But I would also refer to moral evil
2260800	2262480	as this is the way things shouldn't be.
2262480	2264200	So we disagree on that.
2264200	2269200	Yes, so I'm trying to think of, okay,
2270200	2273440	is it, it shouldn't be that kids spend as much time
2273440	2276320	as they do on social media.
2276320	2279000	Do we both agree with that, that they spend too much time?
2279000	2280520	Yes. Would you call it evil
2280520	2282440	if they did spend too much time?
2282440	2283440	Probably yes.
2283440	2285800	Okay, I wouldn't say it was wrong,
2285800	2287160	but I wouldn't say it was evil.
2287160	2290160	So I've shared with you how I define evil.
2290160	2291000	How do you define it?
2291000	2293200	Is the deliberate infliction of hurt
2293200	2295000	on another human being?
2295000	2297480	So I would say that pornography involves
2297520	2301040	the deliberate infliction of hurt on another human being
2301040	2304040	through the photographing of a person.
2304040	2307960	So that would include lingerie models.
2307960	2310080	Again, I'm not sure.
2310080	2311760	I don't have a, I don't know.
2311760	2314440	Men are as capable of masturbating to lingerie models
2314440	2316040	as they are to awful stuff.
2316040	2318080	Right. So what I think the goal should be
2318080	2322040	is to line up the goal of the artist or the photographer
2322040	2324760	and the goal and the intention of the viewer
2324760	2326600	with the dignity of the human person.
2326680	2329000	Because I can view something non-pornographic
2329000	2330520	and say masturbate to it.
2330520	2331360	Right.
2331360	2332480	The problem isn't with the thing I'm looking at.
2332480	2333760	The problem's with me.
2333760	2335320	Likewise, likewise,
2335320	2338320	I could look through a pornographic magazine
2338320	2340160	and feel nothing but pity
2340160	2341920	for these women who don't know their dignity.
2341920	2344040	In that case, objectively, it's photography,
2344040	2345640	but subjectively, it isn't for me.
2345640	2347200	So I think you want both to line up
2347200	2348680	with the dignity of the human person
2348680	2349520	created in the image.
2349520	2352640	Wanting to line up with dignity is totally admirable.
2352640	2357040	Calling the non-lining up is a lingerie model
2357040	2358240	losing her dignity.
2358240	2359280	And you may say yes.
2359280	2360360	Yeah, I think I would say yes.
2360360	2361200	Yeah, okay.
2361200	2362040	Yeah.
2362040	2364200	But again, I want to make a huge distinction
2364200	2365480	between these gradations.
2365480	2366320	Well, and so do I.
2366320	2369200	Something can be far less bad than synchronous.
2369200	2370480	When people say pornography,
2370480	2374280	they're thinking of the most awful behaviors.
2374280	2375360	Well, let me ask you this then,
2375360	2376440	because it sounded like you were saying
2376440	2377880	that if a man views pornography
2377880	2380480	and thereby doesn't commit adultery, it's okay.
2380480	2381520	No, I didn't say okay.
2381520	2382600	I said it wasn't awful.
2382600	2383440	Not horrible, fair enough.
2383440	2384280	Right.
2384280	2385120	Thank you for the correction.
2385120	2385960	Yeah.
2385960	2388880	But you've also said that you're very much opposed
2388880	2392960	to violent pornography, obviously.
2392960	2395840	If a man says I need to watch violent pornography
2395840	2397800	so I don't commit adultery, do you say,
2397800	2399840	well, okay, that's less bad too?
2399840	2403040	Or do you condemn that with a greater severity?
2403040	2405680	Well, because the odds are
2405680	2408760	that the people in it are being hurt.
2408760	2410160	What if they're willing to be hurt?
2410160	2411000	What if they enjoy being hurt?
2411360	2415280	So then I more or less subscribe to your vision
2415280	2416600	of the issue.
2416600	2420360	But again, I want to remind everybody watching or listening
2420360	2425360	that my vision was of Playboy of the 1960s
2425580	2427000	when I was a teenager,
2428320	2433240	which would be regarded today as...
2433240	2434600	Not even worthy of Netflix.
2434600	2436160	I mean, what we once called hardcore,
2436160	2437000	we now call softcore.
2437000	2437840	Yes, okay.
2437840	2440000	But we once called softcore, we now call Netflix.
2440000	2445000	But I have to ask you and many others
2445720	2447760	who feel as you do, and I respect it,
2450800	2452440	is everything...
2453880	2455680	Well, I did ask you.
2455680	2458240	I mean, once you say masturbation
2458240	2460680	under all circumstances is evil,
2460680	2463200	that I will admit we part company.
2463200	2464040	Yeah.
2464040	2464880	And that's fine.
2464880	2465720	I mean, we knew we would disagree.
2465720	2466560	Yes, that's fine.
2466560	2468720	And there's also a lot of things we agree about.
2469560	2472200	There was one, I don't want to say his name
2472200	2473480	because I may be wrong,
2473480	2478480	but I believe there was one major evangelical leader,
2479080	2480400	I mean, major.
2480400	2482280	He was a household name for a while.
2482280	2483400	Dobson, I think.
2483400	2485560	Oh, so you didn't know what I'm referring to.
2485560	2487520	I don't want to misspeak here.
2487520	2488840	Maybe Thursday you can look this up,
2488840	2491880	but I believe Dobson at one point justified masturbation
2491880	2493520	in certain circumstances.
2493520	2494960	See, what I respect about you
2494960	2497320	and what I respect about Jordan Peterson
2497320	2499800	is that very often you tell us to take the hard road.
2499800	2502040	You're like, yes, it's bloody hard, but be a man.
2502040	2503960	Like rise up, choose the harder path.
2503960	2505520	Choose the more virtuous path.
2505520	2508960	I just wish that you or Peterson would be more emphatic
2508960	2510440	when it comes to sexual sins
2510440	2512000	that of course you're tempted to it.
2512000	2513240	Of course you want to do it.
2513240	2516200	What's interesting isn't why people masturbate to pornography.
2516200	2517480	That's obvious.
2517480	2519720	What's interesting is why people decide they don't want to.
2519720	2521600	Well, again, why not encourage them?
2521600	2523720	Don't throw in the word pornography.
2523720	2526480	Masturbate alone is a sin to you and evil.
2526640	2529840	What if he's masturbating to an image he makes up in his brain?
2529840	2532080	If he's masturbating to nothing, I would consider it an evil.
2532080	2532720	Okay, fair.
2532720	2533320	Okay.
2533320	2534040	Yeah.
2534040	2536040	It's...
2536040	2536640	Dobson?
2536640	2540880	Dr. James Dobson in about 1987,
2540880	2542400	the quote appears to be,
2542400	2546120	it is my opinion that masturbation is not much of an issue with God.
2546120	2548000	It's a normal part of adolescence.
2548000	2550560	Indeed, Jesus did not mention it.
2550560	2551920	Jesus didn't mention a lot of things.
2551920	2554000	Well, yeah, but well, it's not insignificant,
2554000	2555920	nor does the Hebrew Bible talk about it.
2555920	2559760	The spilling of seed with Onan, from which we get Onanism,
2559760	2562080	the sin was not that he spilled the seed.
2562080	2567440	The sin was that he didn't have intercourse with his brother's widow.
2568080	2571760	So, I mean, the Catholic would say that reason would show us
2571760	2575280	that masturbation is disordered, that pornography is disordered,
2575280	2578080	because it takes a natural act, which is good,
2578080	2579440	and it thwarts the end of it.
2579440	2581040	That's why I use the example of...
2581040	2583280	What about a man who can't attract a woman?
2584240	2587360	He should spend his life, obviously, then.
2587360	2589680	Yes, because masturbation is not like urination.
2589680	2590960	It's not something you need to do,
2590960	2593840	or else you're going to become neurotic and die somehow.
2593840	2595280	You're not going to find anybody in the morgue
2595280	2597760	with a tag on their toe that says virgin or something.
2599680	2602160	I think it's a pornified culture that's given us this idea.
2602160	2605840	Let me say that the ideal life would involve none of this.
2605840	2608560	I am not preoccupied with the ideal life.
2608560	2610880	I am preoccupied with a good life.
2610960	2614880	As I often say, I am not interested in making saints.
2614880	2616720	I am interested in making good people.
2617360	2622640	And it is so hard to make good people in a post-communist,
2622640	2625520	post-Nazi world, post-Islamic...
2625520	2627760	It's not post yet, Islamic terrorist world.
2628560	2632080	I admit, I am preoccupied with real evil
2632720	2635680	rather than non-idyllic behavior.
2635680	2638080	I admit it. That's where I am...
2638080	2642240	And maybe to clarify my thought, which might make it more acceptable to you,
2642240	2644800	I would say that there are circumstances in which
2645680	2648000	masturbating or even looking at pornography
2648000	2653360	could be a less grave sin due to habit, due to immaturity.
2653360	2656720	But see, even in secular culture, we make fun of masturbation.
2657520	2659920	We don't seem to be proud of masturbation.
2659920	2664080	Even atheists, there's this big move to stop being a cream puff
2664080	2665440	and masturbating into a sock.
2665440	2668640	And instead of that, control your sexual desire.
2668640	2671600	You're not a dog to be neutered.
2671600	2674320	You're someone who has mastery over your lower passions.
2674320	2676080	So I have a desire for food.
2676080	2678800	But if I eat like a pig, then this is going to be bad for my health
2678800	2680560	and this would be the sin of gluttony.
2680560	2681840	I could have the desire to masturbate.
2681840	2683600	But the difference is you can eat.
2685120	2686880	The man who cannot have any sex.
2686880	2690400	No, you're equating orgasm with eating and it's not the same thing.
2690400	2691200	You did.
2691200	2695680	No, you're saying that I'm equating them to show that they're dissimilar
2695680	2697680	in that if I don't eat, I die.
2698400	2700160	But it sounds like what you're saying is, well,
2700160	2701520	but the man who never has a woman,
2701520	2703600	surely he should masturbate or else what?
2703600	2704880	And I'm saying he's not going to die.
2705440	2706720	He's not going to die.
2706720	2706960	Right.
2706960	2710160	And so I think the man should have mastery over that passion
2710160	2711760	and use it appropriately.
2711760	2712960	That's what I would say.
2712960	2715920	Okay. Ideally, I agree with you.
2715920	2718240	So one way that's important that I said that.
2718800	2720720	Ideally, ideally, ideally.
2721280	2725040	But as I said, like in the case of marriages,
2725040	2726400	I want them to love each other.
2727520	2733920	And by the way, let me just, this is not utterly germane to our debate here.
2734560	2740160	But having spoken to so many couples for so many years,
2741840	2746560	I have a phrase which is related to this.
2747520	2749840	But not exactly this, but related.
2750480	2752800	You should make love outside the bedroom
2752800	2754560	and have sex inside the bedroom.
2756080	2756640	I love it.
2757280	2758240	But I think I know what you mean.
2758240	2760160	Oh, I'm glad you love it.
2760160	2762240	Well, it's if I'm ignoring my wife,
2762880	2766640	if I'm not doing acts of kindness towards her throughout the day,
2767760	2771040	then to expect to come together and be intimate
2771040	2774240	in that most intimate of embraces is selfish.
2774960	2778320	But I want to love my bride throughout the day, sacrifice for her.
2778320	2781040	Right. But what I'm saying more than that.
2781040	2781600	Okay.
2781600	2784160	That, of course, I'm saying that, but I am saying more than that.
2784720	2794240	I'm also saying that the bedroom might be a place for the non-holy to express itself.
2794240	2797840	Because we, I believe, were created in God's image and animal's image.
2797840	2803040	And if we, sex allows the animal under holy circumstances,
2803040	2805600	which is matrimony for both Jews and Catholics,
2806480	2812240	that the word for marriage in Hebrew, kiddushin, means holy.
2812240	2816800	I mean, that is the whole Talmudic volumes on marriage.
2816800	2821040	And sex is called kiddushin, which means kadoches.
2821040	2822720	Many Catholics know it means holy.
2824000	2830560	So I Schmuley Boteath is a bearded Orthodox rabbi.
2830560	2831920	I don't know if you're familiar with him.
2832400	2834800	And he wrote a book called Kosher Sex.
2835520	2837200	His argument is as follows.
2838080	2841040	And he's very anti-porn, very.
2842560	2850800	His argument is anything that the couple, the married couple agrees to in the bedroom,
2851680	2854320	they should do, that that's the place.
2854320	2856480	And that's why he calls it Kosher Sex.
2856480	2861600	It wasn't, by the way, universally received well among some religious Jews.
2862080	2867360	I, your views are not all that different from many Orthodox Jews.
2867360	2868720	Why was he opposed to pornography?
2870240	2871440	For the same reasons you are.
