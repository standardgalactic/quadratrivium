Checking Sana/Geoffrey Hinton ï½œ On working with Ilya, choosing problems, and the power of intuition.txt
1. **Intuition in Research**: Intuition is crucial in research. It involves having a strong understanding of the world and being selective about how new information fits into one's existing framework. Good intuitions should be trusted, while bad ones can lead to fatal flaws.

2. **Diversification vs. Specialization**: Geoff believes that focusing on big models and training them on multimodal data is a highly promising approach and suggests going "pretty much all in" on this path, given its current success and widespread adoption.

3. **Importance of Learning Algorithms**: While backpropagation through neural networks has been incredibly successful, Geoff acknowledges that there might be other learning algorithms that also work well by maximizing gradients differently. The brain's approach to learning might be an example of this.

4. **Pride in Life's Work**: Geoff is most proud of the learning algorithm for Boltzmann machines, which he developed with Terry, despite its impracticality. It represents a moment of elegance and enjoyment in his research career.

5. **Current Research Interests**: Geoff spends his time thinking about various questions, including those related to the development of AI and what one should watch on Netflix for relaxation. He also contemplates the broader implications of AI and its societal impacts.
