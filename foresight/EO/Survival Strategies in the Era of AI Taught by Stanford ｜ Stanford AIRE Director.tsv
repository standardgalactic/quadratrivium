0	4920	If a job can be done by a human and it costs $1,000,
4920	8040	because you can't really calculate faster than the machines,
8040	9400	then you let the robot do it,
9400	12160	it will just cost roughly around $200.
12160	16000	AI will make a lot of jobs disappear in the future.
16000	19480	How much more information kids gets nowadays?
19480	21280	It's just completely different now.
21280	24200	We still use the same way to teach them.
24200	26200	And then the more I think about it,
26200	29440	the more I feel like we need to push to change that.
31560	32400	I'm Li Zhang.
32400	34800	I'm the director of the Stanford Air Program.
34800	37840	You know, the era of AI is in the near future,
37840	40920	and I would say it's actually now, it started already.
40920	42880	I'm passionate trying to figure out
42880	45320	what is the right way of teaching the next generation
45320	47800	in the era of AI and robotics.
51200	55080	We have a lot of people are afraid of AI,
55080	56560	so they try to avoid this.
56560	58920	They're like, oh, I wanna stay away from that.
58920	60720	But the thing is that that's probably one
60720	63960	of the most powerful tool that we have ever invented.
63960	65200	If you don't use these tools,
65200	68440	then you cannot really compete with anyone like other people.
68440	71680	I think there's a few things we need to change.
71680	76160	One is that we need to start to teach AI thinking
76160	77400	as early as possible.
77400	80880	AI thinking will allow them to know the difference
80880	82760	between human and AI.
82760	86280	And then the human part is really the innovation part
86280	87800	from zero to one.
87800	90600	That's where AI cannot do a good job.
90600	91760	We need to focus on that.
91760	95200	There's three important things about AI thinking.
95200	96400	With the first thing,
96400	99640	you need to have general understanding of how AI works.
99640	104640	In the past, AI is basically mostly based on the rules
104760	109200	or the specific algorithms that we write in the computer.
109200	110720	The human set the rules.
110720	115720	And then now we developed a different algorithms
116080	119640	like deep learning, reinforcement learning based on data
119640	123080	because we have much more powerful computers
123080	125440	that can handle way more data.
125440	127200	And then they will develop
127200	130200	and trying to find the most optimized solution
130200	131280	based on the current data.
131280	132720	And then the more data you have,
132720	135480	the better solution you usually will get.
135480	137320	If you do the first one,
137320	140400	the second one is that you will gain the ability
140400	142680	to differentiate the human ability
142680	145920	versus the machine's ability or AI's ability.
145920	147600	I think probably most of the audience
147600	150760	don't know there's a scientific research area
150760	152880	called a structural biology.
152880	156560	Scientists in this field study the structure of a protein.
156560	159440	Proteins are so important for all the living creatures.
159440	163440	The whole world have like 100 to 200 million proteins.
163440	165400	This research area like scientists,
165400	166800	a lot of them are focusing on
166800	169120	determining the structure of these proteins.
169120	173600	We human only find just a very little number
173600	175480	of these proteins like the structures of it,
175480	176640	less than 1%.
176640	179080	However, this AI is called alpha fold.
179080	180560	That's from deep mind.
180560	182040	In the past two years,
182040	184960	alpha fold predict like the structure
184960	187760	of almost all the proteins in the world.
187760	190880	And they put it in the open database online.
190880	193640	So a job, once the machines can do it,
193640	195040	then let the machines do it.
195040	197040	And then we focus on the human part.
197080	198640	After you get the first two,
198640	202240	the third one is you will have the ability to work with AI,
202240	204760	use AI to help you to accomplish other jobs.
204760	207560	There's critical part is from zero to one,
207560	209720	which basically that we invent something
209720	211360	that doesn't exist before.
211360	214000	And we probably can do zero to one better
214000	217320	with AI providing a lot of information and things like that.
217320	221800	So we should prepare our kids to learn how to innovate,
221800	224880	to generate new ideas, to use AI to help us,
224880	225880	that kind of stuff.
228040	233040	Creativity, it's something that is really hard to teach.
234840	238080	Or some people think creativity cannot be taught.
238080	240680	How to teach people creativity.
240680	243560	This thing get changed by the Stanford design thinking.
243560	246120	We can use this method to teach you
246120	248720	how to systematically to make innovations.
248720	252320	Design thinking is a methodology that we use here
252320	255760	at Stanford to teach people how to make innovations.
255760	260720	And we do not make you as innovative or creative
260720	263000	as Steve Jobs or Elon Musk.
263000	265760	However, we can use this methodology
265760	270280	to make you more creative or innovative than yourself.
270280	273880	So design thinking has steps that you can follow.
273880	275920	The first step is empathize.
275920	278880	First, you have to understand who you're invent for.
278880	280680	Are you inventing for your parents
280680	284280	or you're inventing for children who are studying in the school?
284280	286320	You have to understand who are the users.
286320	289480	Then you empathize with them, especially their emotion.
289480	292800	And then you go to the second step, which is called define.
292800	296080	A lot of people, they didn't have the right problem
296080	296920	to start with.
296920	299240	Then you have to define that problem clearly.
299240	302800	And then you go to the third step, which is ideation,
302800	306680	which is using brainstorming to generate a lot of ideas.
306680	310000	And then you kind of get feedbacks from the users.
310000	312400	You pick the good ones to prototype.
312400	315040	After you do the prototype, which is the fourth step,
315040	318200	you do test with the user and then you get feedback.
318200	320960	Maybe the feedback is good or maybe the feedback is bad,
320960	323960	but you have to do redesign or reinvent.
323960	328160	We have a phrase called all design is redesign.
328160	331280	If you realize, well, I actually didn't define
331280	333920	this problem right, then you go back to the step two.
333920	336360	So you have to go in this iterations.
336360	340520	Eventually you will have some very nice inventions.
340560	344520	But when you read books and or you listen to some lectures,
344520	347840	whatever, after you finish in that,
347840	349440	you didn't understand it yet.
349440	352440	You have to use it several times to really feel it.
352440	356360	Let me give you an example in one of the class at Stanford.
356360	360880	So basically this project is about how to get good incubators,
360880	363400	get more incubators for the Nepal.
363400	366400	At first that, actually a lot of people are just trying
366400	368600	to say, well, just design it in California.
368600	372040	But then we say, well, you have to gain empathy.
372040	375000	You need to go to the real place.
375000	376400	If you have never been to Nepal,
376400	378000	how can you design for that?
378000	380920	They actually fly to Nepal and they went to the mountains
380920	384240	and to their surprise, they actually see a lot of these
384240	387240	expensive incubators in these medical centers.
387240	389840	They actually are not lack of those machines,
389840	391360	but they don't know how to operate them.
391360	393640	Problem is they find wrong.
393640	395160	They have to redefine the problem.
395160	397280	And then they went back to these villages
397280	399040	and talk with those farmers.
399040	402240	We do need those things, but not in these medical centers.
402240	403560	We need in our home.
403560	404720	We need the cheap ones.
404720	407680	So then they actually design a very cheap,
407680	411280	like kind of functioning as a baby incubator
411280	413080	and have very good success.
413080	414720	When that's a good example,
414720	417560	the problem was defined wrong at first.
417560	420920	And then they go into this design thinking process
420920	423040	and they find a way to redesign the problem.
423040	425560	And then they solve their right problem.
428280	431760	The most interesting thing about AI robotics,
431760	432720	there's a few of them.
432720	434640	I think the first one is chat GPT
434640	438520	because it's probably a surprise for a lot of people
438520	442560	that AI can talk with people in that a very natural way.
442560	445080	And also it can not only chat with you,
445080	446800	it can also write code for you.
446800	448800	It seems like he knows a whole lot
448800	450880	and it's smarter than a lot of people
450880	452720	and which surprise people.
452720	456240	So, and also it's gonna change education for sure
456240	460240	because now kids can use chat GPT to write essays
460240	461080	and do homeworks.
461080	463600	So then teachers need to think about
463600	464840	how to deal with that.
464840	469840	Actually, I just gave my student an assignment yesterday.
470320	472480	I asked a student to write an essay.
472480	474040	I said, well, you know what?
474040	477080	We just talked about chat GPT in a class.
477080	479880	Now I'm gonna give you an assignment to write an essay
479880	481640	with the help of chat GPT.
481640	483440	I'm not really asking you to not use it.
483440	484440	I ask you to use it.
484440	485960	And then after that class,
485960	489040	I will have short discussions with each of you
489040	490560	and tell me how you use it.
490560	491440	How do you feel it?
491440	494600	I think that technology advancement,
494600	499320	you cannot try to ignore it or trying to avoid it.
499320	501920	It's happening and it's just like water.
501920	503240	You cannot block it.
503240	505160	You have to go with it.
505160	509040	For me, I want to understand how chat GPT
509040	511240	is gonna impact education system.
511240	513480	And I wanna work with our students
513480	515240	to understand that better.
515240	518080	So that's why I gave this homework for my students.
519680	522400	I'm a big fan of Autobots, Transformers.
522400	525440	I grew up with those cartoons and I'm a big fan of it.
525440	529360	Even now, I'm still a big fan of Optimus Prime.
529360	530960	And that really inspired me
530960	533320	that I always wanna make cool robots
533320	534680	like when I was a little kid.
534680	538400	And I think most kids, they have a dream when they're young.
538400	540760	It's easier to inspire a dream
540760	542840	when someone's in early ages.
542840	546240	After people grow up, they kinda lose their interest.
546240	547200	They lose their dream.
547200	548240	They don't know what to do.
548240	552400	It's actually critical important for these little minds
552400	553760	to have dreams.
553760	557120	My ultimate goal is to find out
557120	561080	what is the ideal education system for the future.
561080	563800	The education part is really important.
563800	567880	It has profound impact on the next generation's future.
567880	569800	And that's my ultimate goal.
