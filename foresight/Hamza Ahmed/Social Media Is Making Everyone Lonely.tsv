0	5560	Sex and love are fundamental in Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Perhaps that's why Jeffrey feels so depressed.
5560	11160	He's totally deprived from affection. A woman hasn't hugged him in months. Oh, to hold a woman.
12960	19360	Jeffrey wonders to himself why his generation feels so damn lonely. With the most socially connected generation ever,
19360	24400	maybe that's the problem. He looks around and sees everyone he knows with their heads buried into their phones.
24480	27920	It's hard not to feel depressed, and this is what our generation has come to.
27960	33960	Jeffrey wonders if he could make a change. If he could certainly make his generation more social, to take them away from their
34000	39560	addiction to technology. There was a movie that Jeffrey watched which said that if he killed the head of
39560	46280	vampire, all of the minions would follow. And so for the first time in Jeffrey's life, he has a mission. He has purpose.
46280	52080	The state of social media has become very ironic, where now social media makes you anti-social.
52080	57160	I think it's very clear for anyone to know that the more time you spend on social media, the worse your life becomes,
57160	60320	the worse your social skills becomes, the worse your mental health becomes.
60320	67520	And so what we see around us in our generation of young people is everyone who has succumbed to the addictions of these apps.
67520	73720	Because there's a lot of pleasure and dopamine to be gained when you invest into these apps and you get likes and you post pictures
73720	79640	and you get DMs and you get a response from someone. And look, there's attractive people and there's a sexy person and there's a successful person.
79640	86560	But when you take a step back and you objectively evaluate the consequences of social media on your individual life
86640	91360	and also on society and our generation as a whole, it's fucked us.
91360	98720	You and I are in the loneliest generation of human history. There's not been a generation before us that has been lonelier than we are.
98720	102720	You know, there's an argument for social media, which is it lets you connect with people all over the world.
102720	106320	What's interesting, we can connect to anyone, people all over the world.
106320	109440	So why are we even lonelier because of this technology?
109440	116840	Because the connection that you make through these apps, through technology is not even one tenth of the connection that you make in person.
116840	124760	But there is a level of discomfort and challenge and even pain involved in experiencing your social life in real life.
124760	131400	You know, you have to get ready, you have to put clothes on, you have to go outside, you have to face potential rejection in front of everyone else in the public.
131400	134920	Those things can be pretty scary, but previous generations navigated that well.
134920	140720	Now we have an alternative that is incredibly comfortable, quick, fast, pleasurable.
140720	143080	And so of course, most people choose this over this.
143080	146400	Most people choose social media over real life social connection.
146400	148840	And it's in the term social media.
148840	155120	You've always known media isn't good for you, whereas social connection is a very beautiful thing, so we've always wanted to connect with more people.
155120	158240	Well, it's just a struggle when they're currently addicted to Instagram.
158240	162320	I just randomly saw a glimpse of my 22nd birthday party.
162320	165080	I turned 22 years old, fucking hell.
165080	167800	And it was literally like the loneliest moment of my life.
167800	173800	So I just finished university and I had experienced quite like a vibrant social life.
173800	176120	I was in the party drug scene.
176120	181360	So of course, you know, the social life I did have wasn't incredibly high quality, but it was at least something.
181360	184560	And I did have people around me and, you know, friends and girls and everything.
184560	187440	And slowly and surely with worse mental health.
187440	196760	It's so clear when I look back now that of course my life went worse when I started overindulging in social media, video games, porn, junk food, drugs or smoking weed every day.
196760	201520	I started all those bad habits and my life just went down and down and down and down.
201520	209680	I went from being quite like a popular sort of party kid and I was known in like the clubs and everything by girls, by like the guys I would go out with.
209680	215520	And, you know, guys would come up to my apartment, my room and the student accommodations like pre-drinking and everything.
215520	219400	To just slowly becoming more of a recluse and just spending more time on the internet.
219400	222280	I remember my 21st birthday party was in a festival.
222280	226160	Like I turned 21 on the day that we all went to a festival, you know, so hype.
226160	231840	People running up to me that like, you know, I kind of knew from like Instagram and stuff and they'd run up and hug me and like, oh, you know, happy birthday and stuff.
231840	239040	And then my 22nd birthday party just one year later, I remember was in my apartment with the girl that I was living with.
239040	243880	And, you know, like the night before you stay up till 12 to like, you know, it's ticks over.
243880	246920	So June 9th, I stayed up because my birthday is June 10th.
246920	255640	I stayed up and she went to bed early and then as soon as it turned, like 12, I remember just being sat there just like by myself in a dark room, just sad.
255640	256360	And she was sweet.
256360	257680	Like she literally sat in a lawnmower.
257680	260960	She went to bed way early, but she sat in a lawnmower for like 11.59.
260960	271920	She walked in, gave me like a big hug and everything, but then I went to bed and I just kind of like sat there just like on my PC, just incredibly lonely.
271920	275360	I had lost friends and my social life.
275360	280200	And do you know what was interesting is that that was the loneliest period of my life.
280200	285520	And yet compared to the 21st birthday party where I was, you know, I felt so much more social.
285520	288040	At age 22, I had more Instagram followers.
288040	289800	I was getting way more likes on Instagram.
289800	291560	I had way more pictures by all accounts.
291560	298360	I would have seen more popular and more social and perhaps even happier at age 22, even though I was deeply lonely.
298360	306600	I had quite literally one person in my life and that was the girl that I was seeing and that was quite an ideal relationship, which is no disrespect to her.
306600	309720	Because honestly, when I look back, it's like she was actually like a wonderful woman.
309720	324440	And I just wasn't at the level of, you know, sort of developments, especially in terms of mental health, where I could actually be like a good partner and sort of like nourish her feminine energy and praise her and appreciate her so that she would kind of give it back to me.
324440	325600	So I wasn't at that level.
325600	329560	I just remember like, I just remember being very, very lonely that day.
329560	330800	And you know what's very interesting?
330800	337280	That shortly after that birthday, COVID happened, the lockdown happened, and then I decided to make like a very big change in my life.
337280	342840	You may know the date that I'm about to say it's May 2020 was like when I decided to make a change in my life.
342840	343600	I moved out.
343600	352040	So I left my girlfriend, I moved out, came back home, deleted everything, turned everything off and just lived like quite a peaceful life full of discipline.
352040	359600	I set like a military kind of routine, I would wake up at the same time, I would eat at the same time, I would go to sleep at the same time, I would work at the same time, I would stay fasted.
359600	363000	So I would wake up, not eat anything for a few hours work, go outside.
363000	366400	And this was through the COVID lockdown and stuff, but I'd go outside to like exercise and run.
366400	370760	And I started working out, outdoor in like woods, literally, I would work out in the fucking woods.
370760	374360	No social media, no friends, I promise you, I really promise you this is the truth.
374360	378680	I didn't have a friend for about five months, four to five months.
378680	387880	For about four to five months, I moved back home and the only time I would speak to people was either my family or just the off random person who had to kind of like walk past.
387880	392680	And I would like, you know, kind of awkwardly kind of say hello to them whilst I was trying to practice my social skills.
392680	397280	And that period of my life, I look back and I don't remember feeling lonely at all.
397280	397840	You know why?
397840	400040	I remember actually feeling quite socially fulfilled.
400040	402600	I remember that there was a need to make more friends.
402600	407280	And there was one guy that I made friends with, his name is Jonathan, and it was when I was working out in the woods,
407280	409920	so I would work out in this way called like gymnastic rings.
409920	411000	I would use this equipment.
411000	413360	And one time this guy just walked past him and said, Oh, you're on the rings.
413360	414160	Like I use the rings too.
414160	416760	And me and him became friends and we started working out a few times a week.
416760	420800	And I remember just having that one friend and then also just somewhat growing YouTube.
420800	424000	I had like 500 subscribers that actually fulfilled me enough.
424000	429360	I would meet my friend Jonathan to train three, maybe four, five, six times a week for, you know, an hour or two per day.
429360	434760	And then I would also just kind of post videos and just somewhat, you know, spend some time with my family, but not a lot at all.
434760	437080	And I felt completely socially fulfilled by that.
437080	437640	Guess why?
437640	439880	Because during that time, I wasn't on social media.
439880	443440	I was not on Instagram literally for like zero minutes per month.
443440	450640	What's interesting is that you get lonelier the more that you use social media, not just for the practical sense, you know, if you use it for six hours a day,
450640	452160	chances are you're just using it at home.
452160	453560	You're not doing something social.
453560	459920	But it's really because of like this social comparison that when you use social media, you kind of see other people too much.
459920	463840	You see and remember way too many people that shouldn't be in your mind.
463880	466880	Who are no offense to them, but they are irrelevant.
466880	468120	They're not important.
468120	471160	What matters is you in your real life and the people around you.
471160	475480	But when we're on social media, we see hundreds, thousands of more people.
475480	480120	And that really fucks our brain because our brain kind of understands like, oh yeah, like we're not really friends with them.
480120	481080	We haven't seen them in a while.
481080	481840	They don't talk to me.
481840	482960	They didn't invite me.
482960	484720	You know, they're all like, this is a group of people.
484720	485600	They didn't invite me.
485600	492880	You see this, this glimpse into perhaps a fake life that people are representing and your brain can't help but to feel like shit.
492880	494360	And so lonely because of it.
494360	497600	Loneliness is a very painful existence.
497600	501320	And I think we all experienced at least some form of that over the last few years.
501320	511800	I think it should be one of your priorities on your self-improvement journey as you go about trying to improve yourself and develop a new version of yourself to really consider the importance of social connection.
511800	517720	I remember once my friend said to me, my friend Chris said to me in the gym, we were sat in the sauna, we were talking about like happiness.
517720	524400	And he had just read a book called I think Akai, some like Japanese kind of book and it talked about like living a long life.
524400	532000	And he actually mentioned that one of the things that's found to be the biggest influencer of a long, happy life is social connection.
532000	534760	It is so incredibly important for us.
534760	543080	I see Mark Zuckerberg propaganda, like propaganda that's pushed by these social media companies, which this kind of lone wolf mentality that you don't need other people.
543080	545960	That's just not how life works for humans whatsoever.
545960	547280	You need brotherhood.
547320	548320	It's okay to say that.
548320	552800	I know it sounds scary to say that you need someone, but humans have always needed each other.
552800	561000	Our life expectancy was like 20 years, like 10,000 years ago, 50,000 years ago, our life expectancy was like 20 years long because we just kept on dying.
561000	564040	Like we weren't the formidable creatures that we are today.
564040	568000	We just kept on getting killed and like dying from accidents because we weren't around other people.
568000	575640	And as soon as we got into tribes and we're surrounded by more people, our life expectancy started going up and up and up because now we can actually make sure we have enough food.
575680	581040	Some guys can go out to hunt, the women can stay to farm, we can do things together, we can venture out to new habitats.
581040	587560	And even though those are a lot of like the natural caveman, you know, prehistoric kind of areas, it's still honestly very relevant today.
587560	590880	You can venture further when you have close male friends that you can rely on.
590880	591880	You feel stronger.
591880	601640	Like if you go out, like you're on a very simple, specific note, if you go out at nighttime in an environment that you don't feel comfortable, if you're by yourself or with a girl, you will feel quite anxious and it will fuck with your head.
601640	613640	And suddenly if you're rolling with five of your boys that you trust, that you respect, that you know are strong men who have been leveling up themselves just like you have, suddenly if you're way stronger and more capable and way more confident, that's exactly what we need.
613640	615280	You need to be in a gang.
615280	617440	You need to be in like a group.
617440	618680	You need brotherhood.
618680	619600	You need friends.
619600	621080	You need social connection.
621080	628680	It's okay to say that we need things because only with this level of awareness and humility to say, yeah, you know what, I do need other people.
628680	631960	I want, I so desperately need other people in my life.
631960	633760	I'm not okay with being by myself.
633760	635920	I'm not okay with being the fucking lone wolf.
635920	637160	That's boring as fuck.
637160	639160	I don't want to be solo for the rest of my life.
639160	644640	When you say these things and you admit them, that's when you can actually start to take some practical steps to fulfilling that need.
644640	647040	Social media makes you fine with not fulfilling it.
647040	656000	It makes you fine with just staying indoors and just getting some kind of fix, like some kind of feel that you're being social, like an arbitrary, artificial socialness.
656000	657040	And that's unacceptable.
657040	665280	When you delete social media, you will need social connection so much more and that will encourage you, that pain, that need will encourage you to get out there.
665280	666720	Click on this video to learn more right now.
666720	669000	Do the hard work, especially when you don't feel like it.
