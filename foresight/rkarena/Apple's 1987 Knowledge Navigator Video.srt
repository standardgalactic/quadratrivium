1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
you

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,800
You have three messages, your graduate research team in Guatemala, just checking in, Robert

3
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,280
Jordan, a second semester junior, requesting a second extension on his term paper, and your

4
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,920
mother reminding you about your father's-

5
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,800
Surprise birthday party next Sunday.

6
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:58,960
Today you have a faculty lunch at 12 o'clock, you need to take Kathy to the airport by two,

7
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,440
you have a lecture at 4.15 on deforestation in the Amazon rainforest.

8
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:14,280
Right, let me see the lecture notes from last semester.

9
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,440
No that's not enough, I need to review more recent literature, pull up all the new articles

10
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,960
I haven't read yet.

11
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,120
Journal articles only?

12
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,880
Mm-hmm, fine.

13
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,440
Your friend Jill Gilbert has published an article about deforestation in the Amazon, and its

14
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,400
effects on rainfall in the sub-Sahara.

15
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:38,320
It also covers droughts effect on food production in Africa, and increasing imports of food.

16
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,320
Contact Jill.

17
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,920
I'm sorry, she's not available right now, I left a message that you had called.

18
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:52,520
Okay, let's see, there's an article about five years ago, Dr. Flemston or something,

19
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,440
he really disagreed with the direction of Jill's research.

20
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:02,440
John Fleming of Uppsala University, he published in the Journal of Earth Science of July 20

21
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,440
of 2006.

22
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:09,280
Yes, that's it, he was challenging Jill's projection of the amount of carbon dioxide

23
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,800
being released to the atmosphere through deforestation, I'd like to recheck his figures.

24
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,080
Here's the rate of deforestation he predicted.

25
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,280
Mm-hmm, and what happened?

26
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,960
Hm, he was really off.

27
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,280
Give me the university research network.

28
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:39,080
Show only universities with geography notes.

29
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,120
Show Brazil.

30
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:51,520
Copy the last 30 years at this location at one month intervals.

31
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,400
Excuse me, Jill Gilbert is calling back.

32
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Great, put her through.

33
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,920
Hi Mike, what's up?

34
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,480
Jill, thanks for getting back to me.

35
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,160
Well, I guess that new grant of yours hasn't dampened your literary abilities, rumor has

36
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,360
it that you've just put out the definitive article on deforestation.

37
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,480
Ah-ha, is this one of your typical last minute panics for electro material?

38
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,480
No, no, no, no, no, that's not until, um, 415.

39
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,200
Well, it's about the effects that reducing the size of the Amazon rainforest can have

40
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,440
outside of Brazil.

41
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,160
I was wondering, um, it's not really necessary, but, um...

42
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,160
Yes?

43
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,560
It would be great if you were available to make a few comments.

44
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,840
Nothing formal.

45
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,160
After my talk, you would come up on the big screen, discuss your article, and then answer

46
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,320
some questions from the class.

47
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,800
And bail you out again?

48
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,000
Well, I think I could squeeze that in.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,520
You know, I have a simulation that shows the spread of the Sahara over the last 20 years.

50
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,520
Here, let me show you.

51
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,520
Nice.

52
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,520
Very nice.

53
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,520
I've got some maps of the Amazon area during the same time, let's put these together.

54
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,520
Great.

55
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,640
I'd like to have a copy of that for myself.

56
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:29,640
What happens if we bring down the logging rate to 100,000 acres per year?

57
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,800
Hmm, interesting.

58
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,480
I can definitely use this.

59
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
Thanks for your time, Jill.

60
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,800
I really appreciate it.

61
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
No problem.

62
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,680
But next time I'm in Berkeley, you're buying the dinner.

63
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,680
Dinner, right.

64
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,680
See ya.

65
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,680
4.15.

66
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,680
Bye-bye.

67
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:02,040
Well, while you're busy, your mother called again to remind you to pick up the birthday

68
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040
cake.

69
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,160
Hmm, fine, fine, fine, um, print this article before I go.

70
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,160
Now printing.

71
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,960
Okay, I'm going to lunch now.

72
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,720
If Kathy calls, tell her I'll be there at two o'clock.

73
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,640
So find out if I can set up a meeting tomorrow morning with, um, Tom Lee.

74
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,640
Enjoy your lunch.

75
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:27,840
Hello, Professor Bradford is away at the moment.

76
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,640
Would you like to leave a message?

77
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,640
Michael, this is your mother.

78
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,640
I know that you're there.

79
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,640
I'm just calling to remind you to call your sister and pick up the birthday cake.
