00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
you

00:30.000 --> 00:40.800
You have three messages, your graduate research team in Guatemala, just checking in, Robert

00:40.800 --> 00:46.280
Jordan, a second semester junior, requesting a second extension on his term paper, and your

00:46.280 --> 00:47.920
mother reminding you about your father's-

00:47.920 --> 00:50.800
Surprise birthday party next Sunday.

00:50.800 --> 00:58.960
Today you have a faculty lunch at 12 o'clock, you need to take Kathy to the airport by two,

00:58.960 --> 01:03.440
you have a lecture at 4.15 on deforestation in the Amazon rainforest.

01:03.440 --> 01:14.280
Right, let me see the lecture notes from last semester.

01:14.280 --> 01:18.440
No that's not enough, I need to review more recent literature, pull up all the new articles

01:18.440 --> 01:19.960
I haven't read yet.

01:19.960 --> 01:21.120
Journal articles only?

01:21.120 --> 01:22.880
Mm-hmm, fine.

01:22.880 --> 01:28.440
Your friend Jill Gilbert has published an article about deforestation in the Amazon, and its

01:28.440 --> 01:31.400
effects on rainfall in the sub-Sahara.

01:31.400 --> 01:38.320
It also covers droughts effect on food production in Africa, and increasing imports of food.

01:38.320 --> 01:39.320
Contact Jill.

01:39.320 --> 01:44.920
I'm sorry, she's not available right now, I left a message that you had called.

01:44.920 --> 01:52.520
Okay, let's see, there's an article about five years ago, Dr. Flemston or something,

01:52.520 --> 01:56.440
he really disagreed with the direction of Jill's research.

01:56.440 --> 02:02.440
John Fleming of Uppsala University, he published in the Journal of Earth Science of July 20

02:02.440 --> 02:03.440
of 2006.

02:03.440 --> 02:09.280
Yes, that's it, he was challenging Jill's projection of the amount of carbon dioxide

02:09.280 --> 02:14.800
being released to the atmosphere through deforestation, I'd like to recheck his figures.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.080
Here's the rate of deforestation he predicted.

02:17.080 --> 02:19.280
Mm-hmm, and what happened?

02:19.280 --> 02:22.960
Hm, he was really off.

02:22.960 --> 02:27.280
Give me the university research network.

02:27.280 --> 02:39.080
Show only universities with geography notes.

02:39.080 --> 02:44.120
Show Brazil.

02:44.120 --> 02:51.520
Copy the last 30 years at this location at one month intervals.

02:51.640 --> 02:54.400
Excuse me, Jill Gilbert is calling back.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.400
Great, put her through.

02:56.400 --> 02:57.920
Hi Mike, what's up?

02:57.920 --> 02:59.480
Jill, thanks for getting back to me.

02:59.480 --> 03:04.160
Well, I guess that new grant of yours hasn't dampened your literary abilities, rumor has

03:04.160 --> 03:08.360
it that you've just put out the definitive article on deforestation.

03:08.360 --> 03:13.480
Ah-ha, is this one of your typical last minute panics for electro material?

03:13.480 --> 03:19.480
No, no, no, no, no, that's not until, um, 415.

03:20.440 --> 03:25.200
Well, it's about the effects that reducing the size of the Amazon rainforest can have

03:25.200 --> 03:26.440
outside of Brazil.

03:26.440 --> 03:31.160
I was wondering, um, it's not really necessary, but, um...

03:31.160 --> 03:32.160
Yes?

03:32.160 --> 03:36.560
It would be great if you were available to make a few comments.

03:36.560 --> 03:37.840
Nothing formal.

03:37.840 --> 03:42.160
After my talk, you would come up on the big screen, discuss your article, and then answer

03:42.160 --> 03:44.320
some questions from the class.

03:44.320 --> 03:45.800
And bail you out again?

03:45.800 --> 03:49.000
Well, I think I could squeeze that in.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.520
You know, I have a simulation that shows the spread of the Sahara over the last 20 years.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.520
Here, let me show you.

03:59.520 --> 04:00.520
Nice.

04:00.520 --> 04:01.520
Very nice.

04:01.520 --> 04:06.520
I've got some maps of the Amazon area during the same time, let's put these together.

04:19.520 --> 04:20.520
Great.

04:20.520 --> 04:23.640
I'd like to have a copy of that for myself.

04:23.640 --> 04:29.640
What happens if we bring down the logging rate to 100,000 acres per year?

04:38.520 --> 04:39.800
Hmm, interesting.

04:39.800 --> 04:42.480
I can definitely use this.

04:42.480 --> 04:43.480
Thanks for your time, Jill.

04:43.480 --> 04:44.800
I really appreciate it.

04:44.800 --> 04:45.800
No problem.

04:46.160 --> 04:49.680
But next time I'm in Berkeley, you're buying the dinner.

04:49.680 --> 04:50.680
Dinner, right.

04:50.680 --> 04:51.680
See ya.

04:51.680 --> 04:52.680
4.15.

04:52.680 --> 04:53.680
Bye-bye.

04:53.680 --> 05:02.040
Well, while you're busy, your mother called again to remind you to pick up the birthday

05:02.040 --> 05:03.040
cake.

05:03.040 --> 05:07.160
Hmm, fine, fine, fine, um, print this article before I go.

05:07.160 --> 05:08.160
Now printing.

05:08.160 --> 05:10.960
Okay, I'm going to lunch now.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.720
If Kathy calls, tell her I'll be there at two o'clock.

05:13.720 --> 05:19.640
So find out if I can set up a meeting tomorrow morning with, um, Tom Lee.

05:19.640 --> 05:21.640
Enjoy your lunch.

05:21.640 --> 05:27.840
Hello, Professor Bradford is away at the moment.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.640
Would you like to leave a message?

05:29.640 --> 05:31.640
Michael, this is your mother.

05:31.640 --> 05:33.640
I know that you're there.

05:33.640 --> 05:37.640
I'm just calling to remind you to call your sister and pick up the birthday cake.
