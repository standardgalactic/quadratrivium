0	2000	you
30000	40800	You have three messages, your graduate research team in Guatemala, just checking in, Robert
40800	46280	Jordan, a second semester junior, requesting a second extension on his term paper, and your
46280	47920	mother reminding you about your father's-
47920	50800	Surprise birthday party next Sunday.
50800	58960	Today you have a faculty lunch at 12 o'clock, you need to take Kathy to the airport by two,
58960	63440	you have a lecture at 4.15 on deforestation in the Amazon rainforest.
63440	74280	Right, let me see the lecture notes from last semester.
74280	78440	No that's not enough, I need to review more recent literature, pull up all the new articles
78440	79960	I haven't read yet.
79960	81120	Journal articles only?
81120	82880	Mm-hmm, fine.
82880	88440	Your friend Jill Gilbert has published an article about deforestation in the Amazon, and its
88440	91400	effects on rainfall in the sub-Sahara.
91400	98320	It also covers droughts effect on food production in Africa, and increasing imports of food.
98320	99320	Contact Jill.
99320	104920	I'm sorry, she's not available right now, I left a message that you had called.
104920	112520	Okay, let's see, there's an article about five years ago, Dr. Flemston or something,
112520	116440	he really disagreed with the direction of Jill's research.
116440	122440	John Fleming of Uppsala University, he published in the Journal of Earth Science of July 20
122440	123440	of 2006.
123440	129280	Yes, that's it, he was challenging Jill's projection of the amount of carbon dioxide
129280	134800	being released to the atmosphere through deforestation, I'd like to recheck his figures.
134800	137080	Here's the rate of deforestation he predicted.
137080	139280	Mm-hmm, and what happened?
139280	142960	Hm, he was really off.
142960	147280	Give me the university research network.
147280	159080	Show only universities with geography notes.
159080	164120	Show Brazil.
164120	171520	Copy the last 30 years at this location at one month intervals.
171640	174400	Excuse me, Jill Gilbert is calling back.
174400	176400	Great, put her through.
176400	177920	Hi Mike, what's up?
177920	179480	Jill, thanks for getting back to me.
179480	184160	Well, I guess that new grant of yours hasn't dampened your literary abilities, rumor has
184160	188360	it that you've just put out the definitive article on deforestation.
188360	193480	Ah-ha, is this one of your typical last minute panics for electro material?
193480	199480	No, no, no, no, no, that's not until, um, 415.
200440	205200	Well, it's about the effects that reducing the size of the Amazon rainforest can have
205200	206440	outside of Brazil.
206440	211160	I was wondering, um, it's not really necessary, but, um...
211160	212160	Yes?
212160	216560	It would be great if you were available to make a few comments.
216560	217840	Nothing formal.
217840	222160	After my talk, you would come up on the big screen, discuss your article, and then answer
222160	224320	some questions from the class.
224320	225800	And bail you out again?
225800	229000	Well, I think I could squeeze that in.
229000	233520	You know, I have a simulation that shows the spread of the Sahara over the last 20 years.
233520	235520	Here, let me show you.
239520	240520	Nice.
240520	241520	Very nice.
241520	246520	I've got some maps of the Amazon area during the same time, let's put these together.
259520	260520	Great.
260520	263640	I'd like to have a copy of that for myself.
263640	269640	What happens if we bring down the logging rate to 100,000 acres per year?
278520	279800	Hmm, interesting.
279800	282480	I can definitely use this.
282480	283480	Thanks for your time, Jill.
283480	284800	I really appreciate it.
284800	285800	No problem.
286160	289680	But next time I'm in Berkeley, you're buying the dinner.
289680	290680	Dinner, right.
290680	291680	See ya.
291680	292680	4.15.
292680	293680	Bye-bye.
293680	302040	Well, while you're busy, your mother called again to remind you to pick up the birthday
302040	303040	cake.
303040	307160	Hmm, fine, fine, fine, um, print this article before I go.
307160	308160	Now printing.
308160	310960	Okay, I'm going to lunch now.
310960	313720	If Kathy calls, tell her I'll be there at two o'clock.
313720	319640	So find out if I can set up a meeting tomorrow morning with, um, Tom Lee.
319640	321640	Enjoy your lunch.
321640	327840	Hello, Professor Bradford is away at the moment.
327840	329640	Would you like to leave a message?
329640	331640	Michael, this is your mother.
331640	333640	I know that you're there.
333640	337640	I'm just calling to remind you to call your sister and pick up the birthday cake.
