0	5440	Abram was 75 years old when he left Haran.
5440	12480	Abram took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all of their possessions and those who became
12480	17920	members of their household in Haran, and they set out for the land of Canaan.
17920	24520	When they arrived in Canaan, Abram traveled through the land as far as the sacred place
24520	28320	at Shechem, the Oak of Mora.
28320	31600	The Canaanites lived in the land at that time.
31600	38400	The Lord appeared to Abram and said, I give this land to your descendants.
38400	42120	So Abram built an altar there to the Lord who appeared to him.
55520	61880	The religious beliefs of Israel are rooted in the shared culture of Canaan,
61880	67440	although it had unique attributes that differed from the Canaanites.
67440	72080	It still found expression in shared practices and language.
72080	77160	Some traditional practices could not be merged with Yahwism,
77520	84720	but others like the sacred poetry, the music, and the architecture of the Canaanites
84720	91160	were adopted and became integral to the Israelite religion.
91160	96720	The Old Testament's embrace or rejection of these elements
96720	106280	means that the Canaanite religious influences still affect us today through biblical narratives.
106280	113200	The things that the Bible are condemning in the Old Testament are, in fact,
113200	117600	the culture that the Israelites at the time of writing the Bible
117600	122360	are trying to distance themselves from in their own past.
122360	129080	Things like human sacrifice, idolatry, and the worship of more than one God.
129080	134240	These are the things that they themselves practice just like everyone else in the world.
134240	140760	And these are the things that they will polemicize in the text to divorce themselves from their past.
147480	152960	Before the findings at Ugarit Rosh Shamra in 1928,
152960	159880	our knowledge of Canaanite religion was minimal and largely from indirect sources.
159880	163720	The Old Testament didn't mention Canaanite deities and rituals,
163720	168440	but these were often in a negative light making interpretations challenging.
168440	176200	Mentions of Canaanite gods and rituals were also found in Egyptian, Mesopotamian, and Phoenician writings,
176200	180000	including the Karatepe inscriptions from 1946.
180000	184600	However, these weren't enough to form a complete understanding.
184600	189320	Greek historians provided accounts of Canaanite beliefs,
189320	194240	but it was hard to distinguish authentic traditions from later additions,
194240	198520	excavations at places like Biblos and Megiddo.
198520	202520	Give us glimpses, but only a fragmentary picture.
202520	207600	Thanks to the discoveries at Rosh Shamra, ancient Ugarit in North Syria,
207600	210640	the Canaanites tell us their own story.
210640	217680	Hundreds of clay tablets found here, written in a dialect close to the biblical Hebrew,
217760	220120	and offers rich insights.
220120	228040	These tablets feature extensive mythological poems, records related to the temple services,
228040	235400	lists of deities and sacrifices, and details about temple workers and rituals.
235400	240400	Additionally, artifacts linked to gods like Baal and Dagon,
240400	245800	including temple remains and stelae, have been discovered.
245880	252640	It's crucial to understand, though, that while there was a core Canaanite religious belief,
252640	255920	local variations existed.
255920	261520	I mean, they didn't have the internet and no email and the mail system wasn't very great.
261520	265080	So every city you went to had their own ideas.
265080	271440	Not every Canaanite city would have worshiped all the same gods that we know from these texts.
271440	273320	There were variations at play.
273320	278720	The Canaanite religion was more of a public affair than a personal one.
278720	286520	Its rituals, mostly centered on ensuring fertility, were community events.
286520	292440	Though there were individual acts of devotion as seen in the Phoenician inscriptions,
292440	297720	the religion was mainly a communal way to connect with nature's forces.
297760	303800	This involved practices believed to ensure continued creation and rejuvenation.
303800	307440	The prominence of some deities in mythological writings
307440	313040	doesn't always reflect their actual popularity among Canaanite devotees.
313040	317520	Conversely, some gods like Dagon had a minimal role in myths,
317520	320760	merely acknowledged as Baal's father,
320760	327920	but seemed quite revered as evidenced by a dedicated temple and two stele in Ugarit.
333920	339960	El, the Hebrew word for God, is the supreme God and Creator
339960	343480	and shows up as Allah in Arabic.
343480	348520	Variations in the name El are found in many Semitic languages,
348520	352480	Ugaritic, Phoenician, Hebrew, Aramaic, Akkadian.
352480	358160	In Northwestern Semitic cultures, El was a term for any deity
358160	361120	and also specifically for the primary god.
361120	364880	He often stood at the top of many divine hierarchies
364880	367960	and played roles like the god of creation
367960	372240	or the father of gods in certain Canaanite and Ugaritic sources.
372240	376360	Yet, using the name El can be confusing
376360	381880	because sometimes it refers to the main god and at other times to different gods.
381880	388600	For instance, in Ugaritic texts the phrase El-Melik means El the king,
388600	393600	while El Haddad refers to the God Haddad.
393600	398480	In Ugaritic, the plural for gods aligns with the Hebrew term
398480	403640	that sometimes means the singular god Elohim, for example.
403640	409400	Some believe that various authors change stories from polytheistic context
409400	411600	into monotheistic ones.
411600	416200	I myself subscribe to this idea and I will show this in this video.
416200	420880	And this causes many inconsistencies in the text,
420880	424200	but once you see it, everything starts to make sense.
424200	429120	Names with the stem El appear in many Semitic regions
429120	437920	among the Amorites and Sabaic people in the southern Levant.
437920	441800	Several ancient texts in inscriptions mention El
441800	445640	or connect him with other deities from different cultures,
445640	450040	indicating his widespread recognition and influence.
450040	456760	For instance, the Egyptian god Patah shared an epithet with El
456760	461600	and an ancient script described El as the god of eternity.
461600	469200	The Egyptian deity Patah was labeled Lord of Gath in a prism from Tel Lakish.
469200	480720	And on the other side, it bears the name of Amenhotep II, Pharaoh from 1435 to 1420 BCE.
480720	489440	This title also appears in Serabit text 353.
489440	495760	Ta is frequently referred to as Lord or the Eternal One.
495760	501560	This association between El and Patah that brought about the consistent use of olam,
501560	504200	meaning eternal, for El.
504200	509600	Although in Ugaritic records, Ta seems to be more closely related
509600	515760	to the artisan deity Kothar Wachasus, an additional link is observed
515760	521720	with the Mandian angel Patah El, blending the names Patah and El together.
521720	528720	Herodotus, the famous Greek historian who wrote in the 5th century BCE,
528720	535080	who never mentions anything about Israel, Jerusalem or Yahweh or anything like King David or Moses,
535080	539360	does have some interesting things to say about the god Patah,
539360	545320	who he calls by his Greek equivalent Hephaestus.
545320	550520	After the reign of the priest of Hephaestus Patah, the Egyptians were made free,
550520	557680	but they could never live without a king, so they divided Egypt into 12 districts and set up 12 kings.
557680	562200	These kings intermarried and agreed to be close friends,
562200	566840	no one deposing another or seeking to possess more than another.
566840	572200	The reason for this agreement, which they scrupulously kept, was this.
572200	576840	No sooner were they established in their districts than an oracle was given them,
576840	582920	that whichever of them poured a libation from a bronze vessel in the temple of Hephaestus Patah,
582920	589240	whereas in all the temples they used to assemble, would be king of all Egypt.
589240	598920	Now what I found interesting about this text is the division between the 12 tribes, if you will,
598920	603280	of the ruling class of Egypt at this time, and it makes you wonder,
603280	612120	could this be some of the source material used for the curation of the 12 tribes in the story in Genesis?
612120	616200	The 12 districts itself wouldn't be too convincing,
616200	626120	but when you take a look at El or Yahweh, being a god of metallurgy and craftsmanship,
626120	630440	and the uncreated one, like Patah, there's might be some connection here.
630440	648440	Patah is an Egyptian deity responsible for creating the world, manifesting it through
648440	657560	potent force of spoken words. A hymn from Egypt's 22nd dynasty praises Patah for shaping the world
657640	666200	with the vision of his hearts. Meanwhile, the Shabakha stone, originating from the 25th dynasty,
666200	673960	mentions Patah bestowed life upon all deities and their spirits using his heart in his voice,
674920	681800	the curation by the voice, something we see in the god of the Old Testament. His worship then moved
681800	687720	beyond the borders of Egypt, all the way into Syria, and was exported throughout the eastern
687720	693800	Mediterranean. Through dissemination by the Phoenicians, we find figures of Patah and Carthage,
693800	699800	his epithets, Patah, the begetter of the first beginning, Patah, Lord of Truth,
699800	707160	Patah, Lord of Eternity, one who listens to prayers, master of ceremonies, master of justice,
707160	712280	the god who made himself to be God, the double being, the beautiful face.
713560	719240	Now, some of you watching this right now may be familiar with the Heliopolis in Aeneid,
719240	725960	and the creation myths that say that Amun, or Atum, is the self-created craftsman
725960	732680	who created the other gods. And though this is certainly true, the priesthood in Memphis and
732680	741960	Crocodopolis and the elephantines have competing mythologies that make Patah the self-created
742520	751720	demiurge who creates the other gods and humans. An elephantine, Cunum, who like Patah, is also
751720	758840	depicted as a craftsman or demiurge with the potter's wheel behind him, just as Patah has
758920	764440	images of himself with the potter's wheel behind him, as he creates gods and humans alike.
772920	778360	Porphyry once said, At the city of Elephantine, there is an image worshiped, which in other
778360	785240	respects is fashioned in the likeness of a man and sitting. It is of a blue color and has a man's
785240	793480	head and a diadem bearing the horns of a goat. He sits with a vessel of clay beside him, on which
793480	799400	he is molding the figure of a man, and from having the face of a ram and the horns of a goat,
799400	808200	he indicates the conjunction of sun and moon, ra and ya, in the sign of the ram, Amun, while the
808200	815880	color of blue indicates that the moon in that conjunction brings rain, Tefnut. He goes on to say,
816680	824760	in the mysteries of Eleusis, the Hierophant is dressed up to represent the demiurge and the
824760	832280	torchbearer, the sun, the priest at the altar, the moon, and the sacred herald, Hermes. Moreover,
832280	837960	a man is admitted by the Egyptians among their objects of worship, for there is a village in
837960	845240	Egypt called Anibis, in which a man is worshiped and sacrifice offered to him, and the victims
845240	850920	burned upon his altars, and after a little while, he would eat the things that had been prepared for
850920	857720	him as for a man. They did not, however, believe the animals to be gods, but regarded them as
857720	863560	likenesses and symbols of gods, and this is shown by the fact that in many places,
863560	869400	oxen dedicated to the gods are sacrificed at their monthly festivals and in their religious
869400	874440	services, for they consecrated oxen to the sun and moon.
877560	884360	What I find the most striking about this passage is his comparison to the Eleusinian priests,
884360	891400	Abakus and Demeter, Na'kunum, who Pharaoh Khufu was named after, the famed builder of the Great
891400	899000	Pyramid, Giza. Almost seems like a perfect synchronization between the competing creator gods
899560	905480	Amun Ra and Patah. Patah is one of the three major gods of the Memphis Triad,
906120	913000	along with Sekhmet, and he's also the father of Nefertim, and Kunum has an almost identical role
913560	919560	within the Elephantine Triad. The temple of Elephantine was dedicated to Kunum, his consort
919560	926520	Saitis and their daughter Anuket. Elephantine is the city where dozens of Jewish Aramaic texts were
926520	935080	found, that not only physically predate every fragment or manuscript of Hebrew Bible in existence,
935080	944520	I repeat, the Elephantine city where we found older Jewish Aramaic fragments than any
945320	953000	existing fragment or manuscript of the Hebrew Bible in existence. But also, it shows that the
953000	960360	Jews at Elephantine in the 4th and 5th century BCE were still polytheistic during this time.
960360	968520	Following the 587 BCE destruction of Jerusalem, some Judean refugees traveled south in what may be
968520	978520	called an Exodus in reverse, settled at Elephantine. They maintained their own temple, the House of Yahweh,
979400	986440	or Yahoo in this case, in which sacrifices were offered, evincing polytheistic beliefs
987320	994840	functioning alongside that of Kunum. Gods like Osiris and Isis are all over the place in these texts.
995640	1002680	The temple was destroyed in 410 BCE at the instigation of the priests of Kunum.
1003560	1009880	So, what happened? Was Yahweh in direct competition with Kunum over who is the true
1009880	1017960	divine craftsman? Possibly. One of the most common attributes among these metal-ergy
1017960	1024840	craftsmen gods like Hephaestus of the Greeks, Ta of the Egyptians, and Vulcan of the Romans,
1025480	1032200	is their connection to volcanoes and mountains due to the richness of metal ores found at these
1032200	1039160	places. It is very possible that Yahweh is no exception, although he is from an entirely different location.
1040120	1050760	In Exodus, the presence of fire and smoke is paired with the mountains quaking.
1051800	1058440	These tremblings, akin to small earthquakes, are typical of volcanic eruptions,
1059320	1066760	leading to the expulsion of warm gases from the cracks. This expulsion is accompanied by a
1066760	1073880	significant sound, referred to in the Sinai Theophany as powerful shofar sound.
1097240	1104280	Yahweh's revelation is always at a mountain, whether called Sinai or Horib, the event pictured
1104280	1110760	like a volcanic eruption. As these texts show, volcanism seems to be an essential attribute,
1110760	1117880	typically associated with Yahweh, linking him to the Kressman metal-ergy gods as I mentioned before.
1117880	1124600	The account of the Sinai revelation, with its volcanic imagery, is meant to show that Yahweh
1124600	1141160	himself is not just his divine emissary, but a demiurgic craftsman. Some believe Mount Sinai
1141160	1147960	might be one of these Arabian volcanoes, which the Israelites approached in the text when departing
1147960	1155240	Egypt. Jacob Dunn even theorized that Yahweh was once an Arabian volcanic deity. This ties
1155240	1162840	into the theory that Yahweh's worship in Israel has Midianite roots. This theory draws from biblical
1162840	1170840	references that depicts Moses' introduction to Yahweh in Midian. Near the mountain of God,
1171480	1180280	close to Jethro's residence, in Exodus 3, 1-6, here Moses is instructed by God to bring the
1180280	1189000	Israelites after their Egyptian Exodus, Exodus 312. Intriguingly, Moses' father-in-law is portrayed
1189000	1198040	as a Midianite priest, suggesting Moses might have adopted local religious beliefs from him.
1199000	1206760	In other passages, Moses' father-in-law is identified as a Kenite. Some Kenites settled
1206760	1213080	in Israelite lands and maintained a close alliance with them. The biblical figure Cain,
1213640	1219880	considered the Kenites founding ancestor, is significant in early biblical narratives,
1219880	1226920	highlighting this group's ancient proximity to Yahweh. Cain's role as the initial person
1226920	1238120	offered to Yahweh in Genesis 4-3 reinforces this notion. While Yahweh's association with the Midianites
1238120	1246360	might explain Israelites using volcanic imagery to depict the divine presence, linking Yahweh
1246360	1253640	to the Kenites prompts a reevaluation, especially considering the Kenites'
1253640	1255560	metal-urgical pursuits.
1264200	1272440	The Kenites seem to have been skilled metalworkers. Genesis 4 discusses Cain's descendant,
1272440	1280440	Tubel Cain, as a craftsman skilled in molding copper and iron. Semitic cognates of Cain hint
1280520	1288440	that metal-urgical activities were integral to its meaning. Hence, Cain might originally have been
1288440	1296840	represented the pioneering figure in metalurgy with the Kenites, both metalworkers and smelters,
1297480	1305960	as his successors. Their association with the volcanic deity, like Yahweh, becomes clear in
1305960	1313400	this context. Historically, deities linked to metalurgy were also connected with volcanoes.
1313960	1320280	For instance, Hephaestus was linked to Mount Etna in ancient Greece, and the term volcano
1320920	1327880	originates from the Roman god of metalurgy, Vulcan. The connection between volcanoes and
1327880	1333880	metal smelting is straightforward. Both release similar owners and plumes of smoke.
1334840	1341080	In past times, smelting was the sole human activity involved in melting stones,
1341800	1350200	lava pouring from volcano, mirror slag from a furnace, which once solidified resembles volcanic
1350200	1359080	rock. This similarity is evident in Exodus' description of the Sinai Revelation, comparing
1359080	1369320	the ascending smoke to that of a furnace, Exodus 1918. The persistent use of volcanic imagery
1369320	1377000	when describing Yahweh implies a deep-rooted metal-urgical aspect to his earlier identity.
1378200	1386280	Notably, the Song of Deborah associates Yahweh near Ereba's copper mines. This volcanic aspect
1386280	1392840	of divine revelation is also highlighted in Deuteronomy's account of the Horeb Revelation.
1393640	1398680	It notes that Yahweh communicated from amidst fire and smoke,
1399720	1403880	essentially from the volcano's core, while it erupted.
1405800	1413480	Oh Yahweh, when you came forth from Sire, advanced from the country of Edom, the earth trembled,
1413480	1420680	the heavens dripped, yea, the clouds dripped water, the mountains quaked or flowed before
1420680	1425800	Yahweh, the one of Sinai before Yahweh, God of Israel.
1428680	1435080	The writings in Zechariah support this idea. The book starts by sternly rebuking the earlier
1435080	1441640	prophets of Israel, accusing them of abandoning the paths of Yahweh and ignoring his call.
1442600	1449800	Zechariah 1, 4-6, this assertion is further elaborated when the text predicts the arrival
1449800	1460280	of four rescuers, dispatched by Yahweh, referenced as Smiths, and Zechariah 2, 3-4, Smiths,
1460280	1468920	and subsequent revelation, Zechariah 6, 1-5. Zechariah witnesses four soaring chariots,
1469720	1474600	representing the four winds, originating from the bronze mountains.
1475720	1481800	This terminology alludes to the copper mining regions, like Ereba and Sinai,
1482520	1489960	hinting at Yahweh's earlier residence. Thus, even in Zechariah's time, there were those who
1489960	1493560	recalled Yahweh's association with metalurgy.
1502840	1510120	Recognizing Yahweh's historical role as the deity overseeing metalurgy in the Southern Levant,
1510920	1520520	sheds light on various aspects of his biblical character. In fact, Yahweh is nowhere to be found
1520520	1529000	in any of the Ugaritic or Northern Canaanite texts or inscriptions, which are dominated by El
1529000	1536280	and Bell. As well as different craftsmen God, Kothar Wachasus, who I mentioned earlier,
1536840	1543960	who is identified with Ptah in texts that survive from Memphis, as well as Anki of the Babylonians.
1544920	1552600	So, Yahweh is most likely local to the Southern Levant, near the Sinai Desert and Midian.
1555000	1564760	In Isaiah 31-9, an oracle of Yahweh, whose fire is in Zion, in his furnace in Jerusalem,
1566760	1574520	imagery of metalurgy undeniable here surrounding Yahweh. This could also help explain the biblical
1574520	1582440	author's attempts to polemicize Bell as an evil opposition to Yahweh, considering how popular
1582440	1590280	Bell was to northern Israel, and being the prince and son of El. He only has to be opposed by Yahweh.
1590280	1597640	While many view this portrayal as merely a symbolic expression without deeper theological
1597640	1605080	meaning, considering the other metallic attributes associated with Yahweh, it probably reveals
1605080	1612040	a metallurgical facet to Yahweh's worship in Jerusalem. In this perspective, the numerous
1612040	1619240	metal artifacts in the Jerusalem Temple aren't just symbols of grandeur. Their context largely
1619240	1625640	details an exodus via the depiction of the Tabernacle. It specifies about the metals used,
1625640	1631560	hint at deeper theological importance they held. They symbolize the heavenly furnace
1632120	1639480	within the Israelite sanctuary, turning it into the earthly abode of the Israelite deity. Moreover,
1640040	1647960	the copperclad altar in the Temple's grounds lends a metallurgical undertone to the sacrifices.
1647960	1655880	The glow from this copper surface, when heated to nearly 1000 Celsius, for the burning sacrifices,
1656520	1660920	is reminiscent of the luminance of liquefied copper or gold.
1667000	1672760	The beginning of the Prophet Ezekiel's vision recounts his entrance into the heavenly realm
1672760	1679720	as follows. And I looked and behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud
1680360	1687160	with a fire flashing up and brightness around it, and in its midst, something like Hasmal,
1687880	1694040	out of the midst of the fire. The vision illustrates Hasmal, an entity radiating
1694040	1700760	powerful luminance amidst celestial flames. This unique term is exclusively found in Ezekiel's
1700760	1707880	revelation within the Bible. However, comparable words appear in both Egyptian and Akkadian,
1708440	1715480	Hashmen and Hashmalu, referring to an amber or yellowish-orange metal or metallic mixture.
1716360	1722680	The Septuagint translates it as helectron, signifying either amber or electron,
1723720	1729400	a natural blend of gold and silver. While many translations peg Hashmel as amber,
1730040	1735560	this interpretation doesn't quite fit, given the reference to the glowing embers within the flame.
1736520	1743800	In Ezekiel 1.13, it's more likely that Hashmel alludes to something shining brilliantly due to
1743800	1752040	high heat, considering that burning amber emits smoke but not light. It stands to reason that
1752040	1757800	Ezekiel 1. Hashmal is more likely a representation of liquefied metal.
1763640	1769000	When they moved, I could hear the sound of their wings like the sound of mighty waters,
1769000	1777320	like the sound of Shaddai, a tumult like the din of an army. In Ezekiel's depiction of these beings
1778280	1785640	and their movement, it seems he's detailing the powerful gusts that fuel the celestial furnace,
1785640	1792680	enhancing the creation of shining embers. Essentially, this vision portrays Yahweh's
1792680	1800440	divine realm as a massive kiln encircling by winged entities that drive the air current
1800520	1807160	akin to bellows. Taking into account both Ezekiel's imagery and Isaiah's analogy,
1807160	1812520	it becomes clear that these prophetic insights symbolize Yahweh's manifestation
1813080	1818520	in both the celestial and terrestrial realms through the imagery of a colossal furnace.
1819080	1824600	This emphasizes the strong ties of his worship to the world of metallurgy.
1825400	1831720	The oldest plausible occurrence of his name is in the Egyptian land of Sashu Yahweh,
1831720	1841320	an inscription from the time of Amenhotep 3rd, 1390-1352 B.C. The Shasu, being nomads from Midian.
1842120	1850600	Yes, Midian, there you go again, and Edom in Northern Arabia. This gives the Yahweh as a Midian God,
1850600	1855880	way more plausibility. When we look at the Greek sources like Herodotus and Plutarch,
1855880	1861080	for which gods are worshiped in this region, they both claim that it's Dionysus and Venus
1861080	1864840	that are the main gods worshipped here. One might immediately dismiss this
1865480	1873480	due to the blatant differences between Greek Dionysus and Yahweh. However, the Bronze Age
1873480	1880680	Dionysian religion was so widespread and his worship flourished from Turkey down to Egypt
1880680	1885960	along the Mediterranean. So if Yahweh was connected to this ancient god in any way,
1886840	1891960	he would almost barely resemble him anymore by the time of antiquity. It's possible that Yahweh
1891960	1899880	could be a metallurgy volcano god with Dionysian attributes. For example, figures like Tacitus,
1899880	1907320	John the Lydian, Varro draw parallels between Yahweh and Bacchus Dionysus. Often Jews employed
1907320	1916200	symbols commonly linked to Dionysus, including chylixes, amphorae, ivy leaves, and grape clusters.
1916200	1922440	Plutarch highlighted these resemblances to argue that the Jews venerated a version of Bacchus
1922440	1929720	Dionysus. In Plutarch's questions in Moralia, he points out that Jews praised their deity
1929720	1936120	using the exclamations Iwa Sabao, chants that are typically related to Dionysus.
1959880	1983000	This is just many of the hundreds of Dionysian imagery that is found throughout the Hebrew
1983000	1988360	Bible, including the fact that the temple was designed with golden vines and golden grape
1988360	1994600	clusters throughout the sanctuary designed by Solomon, with golden satyrs who are the race of
1994600	2001720	daemons that are led by Dionysus to battle. In the ancient Greek text, many biblical parallels
2001720	2007480	and allegories are associated with the vine. The children of Israel are referred to as a vine
2008040	2015400	in Isaiah 5-7 and in Isaiah 9-10, Isaiah likens God as the owner of a vineyard,
2015400	2021480	and Israel is the vineyard. The grapevine is one of the seven species with which the land of
2021480	2028920	Israel was blessed. Deuteronomy 8-8, an ample supply of wine symbolized prosperity and well-being,
2028920	2036040	and overflowing that symbolized divine blessing. Every man under his vine and under his fig tree
2036760	2042920	symbolizes the idealized past and hope for a future peace. Threats of national disaster
2042920	2048040	were couched in terms of laying waste to the nation's vines and fig trees.
2048040	2056520	Hosea 2-14, Joel 1-7, the vines in blossom symbolized the passing of winter. Song of Songs 2-13,
2056520	2064920	and the ripening of fruit represented a fulfilled state of being, Joel 2-22. Although the fruit
2064920	2071720	of the vine was eaten fresh or dried, the plant was primarily valued for its fermented juice,
2071720	2077560	which was considered an appropriate gift of royalty. A description of Israelite culture
2077560	2083720	is provided by Isaiah and his parable concerning a vineyard. Let me sing for my beloved. A song
2083720	2090360	of my beloved about his vineyard. My beloved had a vineyard on a fruitful hill. He broke the ground,
2090360	2097640	cleared it of stones, and planted it with choice vines. He built a watchtower inside it. He hewed
2097640	2109320	a winepress in it, Isaiah 5-1-2. Many ancient depictions of Dionysus are shown as a man riding
2109320	2114680	a donkey, according to multiple sources, one of them which includes Manacias of Rhodes, who claims
2114680	2121880	that Antiochus IV raided the temple of Jerusalem, found within the Holy of Holies a golden donkey
2122440	2129320	with a man riding on it. According to Tacitus, when Pompey the Great raided the temple of Jerusalem,
2129320	2136520	all he found within the Holy of Holies was a golden ivy diadem, a symbol of none other
2136520	2143560	than Dionysus Bacchus. A coin was released by Pompey to commemorate his triumph over Judea,
2144200	2151240	which displayed a bearded individual on his knees holding a branch with the caption Bacchus
2151240	2159480	Judeus. This can be translated as either the Jewish Bacchus or Bacchus from Judea. Some interpret
2159480	2165560	this figure as representing Yahweh as a regional version of Bacchus or Dionysus. However, considering
2165560	2170920	such coin designs usually showcase subjugated individuals, rather than the deities of the
2170920	2177000	conquered, others believe it might symbolize a Judean whose name was Bacchus. This figure is
2177000	2184200	sometimes thought to be the Hasmonean king Aristobelus II, whom Pompey defeated. Regardless,
2184200	2191720	one of the many titles of Dionysus was Yaho or Yacus, and the Phrygians in the east called him
2191720	2201000	Savatsios, a god who was later identified by Romans as Theos Hipsistos, which means god most high,
2201000	2210120	the initial Jewish settlers in Rome faced expulsion in 139 BCE. Cornelius Hyspilus,
2210120	2216440	acting under a law that forbade spreading the corruption of worship of Jupiter Savatsios,
2216440	2224200	banished the Chaldean astrologers and the Jews. Nias Cornelius Hyspalus pray to our
2224200	2230200	peregrinus in the year of the consulate of Marcus Populus Lannis and Lucius Calpurnius,
2230760	2237160	ordered the astrologers by an edict to leave Rome and Italy within 10 days, since by a fallacious
2237160	2244520	interpretation of the stars they perturbed fickle and silly minds, thereby making profit out of their
2244520	2250920	lies. The same praetor compelled the Jews who attempted to infect the Roman custom with the
2250920	2259800	cult of Jupiter Savasios to return to their homes. This action suggests that Romans possibly equated
2259800	2266520	the Jewish Yahweh Tsavaot, meaning lord of hosts, with Job Savatsios.
2266520	2286120	Plutarch posited that the Jews revered Dionysus and celebrated the Sabbath as a tribute to Savatsios.
2286120	2293320	Additionally, he explored the idea of equating the Jewish god with the Egyptian entity Typhon,
2293960	2301080	although he later dismissed this association. Meanwhile, the monotheistic Hypsasterians revered
2301080	2306680	the most high using a name that might have been linked to the Jewish deity Herodotus,
2307240	2313480	who, like I said, never mentions Israel or Jerusalem or Yahweh, does happen to describe
2313480	2321240	a local religion somewhere between Mount Sinai and Phoenicia, possibly Midianite territory,
2321240	2327000	who have a similar ritual as described in the Hebrew Bible, such as the priests wearing similar
2327000	2334200	white and blue robes with golden tassels that are seen among priests of Dionysus and Demeter
2334200	2341560	and Eleusis and the blood oath rites, which seem to look very similar to Leviticus blood oath rites.
2342200	2347720	He is to dip his finger into the blood and sprinkle some of it seven times before the Lord
2348440	2354760	in front of the curtain of the sanctuary. Now compare this to the right the Herodotus records
2354760	2360440	among these local Arabians. There are no men who respect pledges more than the Arabians.
2361400	2368440	This is how they give them. A man stands between two pledging parties and with a sharp stone cuts
2368440	2375960	the palms of their hands near the thumb. Then he takes a piece of wood from the oak of each
2375960	2379720	and smears with their blood seven stones that lie between them.
2380520	2387800	Meanwhile, calling on Dionysus and the heavenly Aphrodite. In both cases, the blood is sprinkled
2387800	2402760	or smeared exactly seven times to seal the oath. A painting on a jar found at Kuntalit
2403400	2409960	under the inscription Yahweh of Samaria and his Asherah dated to 800 BCE, possibly the male
2409960	2415640	and female pair that Herodotus thought was Dionysus and Aphrodite. In an inscription discovered in
2415640	2423640	Iron Getty and dated around 700 BCE, Yahweh appears described as the Lord of the Nations.
2423640	2430760	While in other contemporary texts discovered in Kierbet Laya near Lakish, he is mentioned as
2430760	2439080	the ruler of Jerusalem and probably also of Judah Yahweh in the form of Yaho. It is frequently
2439080	2445960	invoked in Greco-Roman magical texts dating from the 2nd century BCE to the 5th century of the
2445960	2454760	Common Era, most notably in the Greek Magical Papyri under the names Yaho, Adonai, Sabaoth and
2454760	2462600	Eloi. These are also used as Bacchic chants among Dionysian religious revelers at this time.
2462600	2470200	Use of Yaho becomes blurred by the usage. Since the 2nd century BCE, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans
2470200	2477480	had identified the evil god Seth Typhon, often depicted as a donkey-like creature with the Jewish
2477480	2485320	god Yahweh. The Seth Yahweh tradition with all its negative valence was then applied to the
2485320	2492440	Creator worshiped by the Christians as well. Evidence for this view comes from the early
2492440	2501720	Christian depiction of the Creator and his sons in donkey or typhonian form, the oldest manuscripts
2501800	2508840	of the Greek Septuagint, Old Testament in Greek, before the Church editions came in the 4th century
2509560	2519800	show Yaho in them for Leviticus 327 and 427. These are replaced with the uniform Curios or Lord
2520360	2526760	in the 4th century Church codexes of the Sinaiticus, Alexandricus, and Vaticanus.
2527400	2534600	I think it is very possible that we have in Yahweh a warrior, Demiurgic craftsman,
2534600	2539960	with ancient Bronze Age Dionysian elements passed down through the rites and traditions.
2539960	2546840	Although much closer to something like Vulcan than of Dionysus, this Yahweh, the local craftsman
2546840	2554520	metal-urgy god of the southern Levant, became infused with El, the chief god of the Canaanites,
2554520	2562280	to become Yahweh Elohim. This also puts him in direct opposition to Baal, the prince and son of El
2562280	2564200	in the northern Canaanite religion.
2575320	2580040	For Canaanites in the broader Levantine region, El was the highest god,
2580040	2587080	fathering notable gods like Baal and Yam. In Ugrit, El was married to the goddess Asherah,
2587080	2593720	but no temple was dedicated solely to him. Numerous titles and attributes describe El
2594360	2601800	from being a creator and king to a wise elder. Some myths feature him prominently, such as
2602600	2609800	a tale where he encounters two women by the sea and fathers the deities of dawn and dusk.
2611080	2617880	In an Ugritic story, El hosts a feast for the gods on Mount Lel, which may indicate
2618600	2627160	he lived in a tent explaining his lack of a dedicated temple. This text also suggests
2627240	2634360	he might have resided near sources of saltwater and freshwater in the text Palace of Baal story.
2635160	2641800	Baal Haddad, commonly known as Dagon's son, is occasionally referred to as El's son,
2642840	2649640	hinting at El's overarching authority over the gods. Another fragmentary text depicts El
2649640	2657080	inviting gods to a banquet where he gets embarrassingly drunk, showcasing his human-like flaws
2658120	2666120	Regarding the god El, he was seen as the preeminent deity residing atop the monumental Mount Saphon
2666920	2673960	where all gods convened, similar to Mount Olympius. Ugritic texts referred to the collective gods
2673960	2682360	as El's offspring, or all the gods to divine assembly. El was esteemed with titles such as
2682440	2689560	creature maker, the monarch, the Baal El, and humanity's father. Even though royal attributes
2689560	2696760	were primarily ascribed to El, he often came across as a figurehead, sometimes distant and
2696760	2704440	inactive, resembling what experts termed far-off supreme deity, something like we see in Zoroastrianism
2704520	2711720	with Zorvan. He lived in a celestial realm, termed the sources of the two deeps, where he
2711720	2718840	attended to visitors and dispatched directives via envoys, imagined as a kind of elderly figure.
2719480	2726680	El was sometimes named El the Benevolent. Eisfelt suggests that this particular characteristic
2726680	2732680	might have influenced the Israelites to envision their god Yahweh with more compassionate traits.
2732680	2739480	The name El likely stems from the root Yowl, meaning powerful or chief, and is believed to be
2739480	2744520	a descriptive term, as referenced by W. F. Albright in his works.
2754520	2760200	But the belief system of the Canaanites, a group of Semitic peoples from the ancient Levant,
2760760	2766520	spanned from the early Bronze Age up to initial centuries of the common era.
2766520	2772680	This religion was characterized by the worship of multiple deities and, in certain instances,
2773240	2779400	the exclusive veneration of one god while acknowledging the existence of others. The
2779400	2787960	Pantheon and Ugarit referred to the deities Elohim or El's descendants. Thilo of Biblos,
2787960	2793800	in the first century, Phoenician writer, who cited Sakoniethin of Beirut,
2793800	2799640	priest from the Bronze Age apparently, identified the chief creator god as Elian.
2799640	2806200	He was considered the progenitor of other gods. Greek records mention his union with Beirut,
2806840	2813720	symbolizing the city of Beirut. Such divine city unions can also be drawn parallel with
2813720	2824520	Melkart and Tyre, Kamash and Moab, Tanit and Balhaman in Carthage, and Yah with Jerusalem.
2824520	2832360	El-Eliyan's relationship with Asherah can be likened to the Greek tales of Kronos and Reia,
2833080	2836440	or the myths of Saturn and Ops.
2836680	2848600	At about this time, the descendants of the Dioscary put together rafts and ships,
2848600	2855560	and made voyages, and, being cast ashore near Mount Cassius, consecrated a temple there,
2855560	2863080	and the allies of El, who is Kronos, were surnamed Elohim, as these same were surnamed
2863160	2870040	after Kronos, what have been called Kroni. It was a custom of the ancients in great crisis
2870040	2876520	of danger for the rulers of a city or nation in order to avert the common ruin to give up the
2876520	2882520	most beloved of their children for sacrifice as a ransom to the avenging daemons, and those
2882520	2889640	who were thus given up were sacrificed with mystic rites. Kronos then, who the Phoenicians
2889640	2896760	call El, who was king of the country subsequently after his disease, was deified as the star Saturn,
2897480	2904040	and had by a nymph of the country named Anna Brett, an only begotten son, whom they call on
2904040	2909800	this account, Ye dude, the only begotten, still so called among the Phoenicians,
2910920	2917800	and when very great dangers from war had beset the country, he arrayed his son in royal apparel,
2918520	2925160	prepared an altar, and sacrificed him. Kronos also, in going around the world,
2925960	2932200	gives the kingdom of Attica to his own daughter Athena, but on the occurrence of a pestilence
2932200	2939960	and mortality, Kronos offers his only begotten son, as a whole burnt offering to his father Orinos,
2940040	2948280	that circumcises himself, compelling his allies to do the same. This has obvious parallels to the
2948280	2956040	story of Abraham, sacrificing his son Isaac on the altar. But then being stopped at the last minute,
2956040	2962600	which is the polemic against the old ways, the story of Abraham is an obvious euhemerization
2962600	2968040	of the text about El and Kronos, and archaeologists and Canaanite scholars
2968680	2974760	claim that the practice of child sacrifice was rampant among Canaanites in the first millennium
2974760	2980760	BC, as is clear from the frequent biblical allusions, as well as from the fact that tested
2980760	2986360	by Roman witnesses that the Carthaginians were migrated from Phoenicia in the 9th and 8th century
2986360	2993640	BC, practiced human sacrifice on a large scale. Down to the fall of Carthage, the root of this
2993640	3000760	practice in Punic religion is illustrated by the fact that it had not seized by the 3rd century
3000760	3007480	of the common era. Despite repeated Roman efforts to wipe it out, the Babylonians also
3007480	3014680	practice this due to the ritual of dressing sacrifice victim in royal purple to imitate a
3014680	3021800	substitute king and slaying them in public square. Our best source occurrences are the archaeological
3021800	3032680	remains from the royal death pits at early dynastic Ur from 2600 to 2500 BCE, and textual records of the
3032680	3038440	substitute king ritual that was practiced at least from the early 2nd millennium BCE,
3039240	3045960	down to the time of Alexander the Great. These rituals were known and practiced far and wide,
3046520	3052040	and El, who was also called Cronos, was at the center of these.
3059560	3064920	Again, would it not have been far better for the Carthaginians to have taken Critias or
3064920	3071800	Diagoras to draw up their law code at the very beginning, and so not to believe in any divine
3071880	3078360	power or god rather than to offer such sacrifices as they used to offer to Cronos.
3080680	3087240	With us, for instance, human sacrifice is not legal but unholy, whereas the Carthaginians
3087240	3092920	perform it as a thing they account wholly and legal, and that too when some of them sacrifice
3092920	3098520	even their own sons to Cronos, as I daresay you yourselves have heard.
3099080	3107560	And from then on to the present day they perform human sacrifices with the participation of all,
3107560	3113640	not only in Arcadia during the Laikeia and in Carthage to Cronos, but also periodically
3113640	3119480	in remembrance of the customary usage. They spill the blood of their own kin on the altars,
3119480	3125640	even though the divine law among them bars from the rites, by means of Perahenterra,
3125640	3132200	and the herald's proclamation anyone responsible for shedding of blood in peacetime.
3134120	3141080	Was chosen as a sacrifice for the city, for from ancient times the barbarians have had a custom
3141080	3143960	of sacrificing human beings to Cronos.
3144680	3158360	In Leviticus 1821, in Deuteronomy 1230, the Torah contains a number of in-laws forbidding child
3158360	3166200	sacrifice and human sacrifice in general. The Tanakh denounces human sacrifice as barbaric
3166200	3173560	customs of Baal worshippers. For example, Psalm 106-37, this is another example of the
3173560	3178840	biblical authors detaching themselves from the past of ancient Israel. It is impossible to
3178840	3185960	reconstruct some of the details of Canaanite ritual from references in the Old Testament.
3185960	3194440	1 Kings 18 describes the contest of Elijah, the prophets of Baal, on the summit of Mount Caramel.
3194440	3201080	The latter are said to have leaped about the altar, to have cut themselves after their manner
3201080	3208040	with knives and lances, till the blood gushed out upon them. The gashing with knives is found in
3208040	3214600	the description of El's mourning of the dead Baal, as well as in the writings of Lucian of
3214600	3222360	Samosota in the 2nd century, whose states that the custom was characteristic of the ceremonial
3222360	3231560	mourning of Adonis, which was performed annually at the Syrian sanctuary in Hierapolis, also known as
3231560	3245480	the Holy City. Moloch, sometimes written as Molech, was a Canaanite god mentioned in the
3245480	3252760	biblical accounts with child sacrifice. The name combines the consonants from the Hebrew word
3252760	3260280	Melch, meaning king, with the vowels from Boshet, meaning shame. In the Old Testament,
3260280	3267560	Boshet is often used as an alternative name for the widely recognized god Bael, who translates to
3267640	3275480	Lord. Moloch is also depicted in the Septuagint in Amos 6, with the star god Rhefane.
3285800	3293320	In the Hebrew, it's Sikkoth and Chion, instead of Moloch and Rhefane. This text directly connects
3293320	3300440	Saturn with Moloch in the following way. Sikkoth is a celestial god, recognized from the
3300440	3308200	on-god list discovered at Ugarit, originally sourced from Nippur and various Mesopotamian
3308200	3316120	origins. Here, it's represented as Ninerta, who is the principal deity in Mesopotamian culture
3316120	3322440	that is associated with this planet Saturn, and also acknowledged in the West and occasionally
3322520	3329400	equated with the god Horon, a god worshiped by the Samaritans. The name Sikkoth in Amos
3329400	3337080	precisely echoes this star god's name. Its title being Melch, or king, suggests the deity's prominent
3337080	3343240	status. It becomes the god Moloch in the biblical text. This indicates that Sikkoth holds the highest
3343240	3352120	significance in the ritual mentioned by Amos. Meanwhile, Chion correlates with the Akkadian term
3352200	3360520	Kajmanu, denoting the steadfast, the steady one, which is a reference to the star god Horon,
3360520	3366280	who is also equated with Sikkoth, is considered one of the most attested deities of the ancient
3366280	3372520	sources who shows up in text from the southernmost ends of Egypt all the way up to Turkey. He is
3372520	3380920	considered a god of healing, drugs, magic, forbidden knowledge, and doom. A possible forerunner to the
3380920	3388360	serpent in the garden, adding yet another layer of ancient deities that get polemicized in the
3388360	3395560	biblical text. In the Hebrew scriptures, Moloch is depicted as a foreign god who occasionally found
3395560	3402680	a foothold in Israel's religious practices due to the adoption of synchronistic beliefs by some
3402680	3410280	of the unfaithful kings. The divine commandments given to Moses explicitly prohibited the Jews
3410280	3416840	from engaging in the practices of the Egyptians or Canaanites. The edict stated,
3417560	3425000	you shall not sacrifice any of your children in fire to Moloch, thereby defiling the name of your
3425000	3435160	god, Leviticus 1821. Yet it is documented that influence kings like Ahaz and 2 Kings 16 and
3435160	3445960	Manessa, 2 Kings 21, under Assyrian sway, paid homage to Moloch at Tofeth, a hilly area just
3445960	3453880	outside Jerusalem. While this site thrived under the leadership of Manesh's son, King Omnon, it was
3453880	3461400	eradicated during King Josiah's rule, who was known for his religious reforms. He is quoted,
3462040	3468280	he desecrated Tofeth in the valley of Benhenom, so no one could use it to sacrifice their son or
3468280	3485960	daughter in the fire to Moloch, 2 Kings 2310. In Canaanite tales, two mountains,
3485960	3495080	Targitzi and Therimagi, support the sky and enclose the terrestrial ocean. W. F. Albright
3495080	3500600	suggests that the term El Shaddai stems from a Semitic origin found in the cating words
3501240	3508760	Shadu, meaning mountain, and Shadau, translating as mountain dweller. This associates with one of
3508760	3517320	the Amurus names. Philo of Biblos also claims that Atlas was an Elohim, just as he is a Titan
3517320	3522840	in the Greek text, aligning with El Shaddai's mountain god interpretation. Harriet Lutzky
3522840	3531160	offers another viewpoint, linking Shaddai with the Hebrew word sad, meaning breast. This suggests
3531160	3537320	a connection with the Semitic goddess, posits the twin mountains as symbolic breasts of the earth,
3538200	3545480	dual mountain themes are recurrent in Canaanite lore, similar to Horib and Sinai from the Bible.
3545480	3550280	Their religious beliefs of the Canaanites were shaped by their geographical location,
3550920	3556920	nestled between Egypt and Mesopotamia. These neighboring regions significantly impacted
3556920	3564280	Canaanite spirituality. For instance, during the role of the chariot rhyoning Mariano in
3564360	3573480	Egypt's Hyksos era, Baal began to be linked with the Egyptian deity Set, especially Set's Setaka form.
3574440	3581160	From that point on, Baal's depictions included the crown of lower Egypt and a distinct Egyptian
3581160	3589640	posture. Likewise, deities like Athoret, later known as Ashura and Anat, started being illustrated
3589640	3596360	with Egyptian wigs reminiscent of Hathor or Isis. From another perspective,
3597160	3603720	Jean Batarro proposed that Yah of Ebla, potentially a precursor to Yam,
3605000	3612120	god of the sea, was aligned with the Mesopotamian god Ia during the rule of the Akkadian empire.
3612840	3616200	The Canaanite faith in the middle and late Bronze Age
3616920	3624760	showed evident influences from the Hurrians and Mitonites. The Hurrian goddess Hibat found devotees
3624760	3632520	in Jerusalem, while Baal was often equated with the Hurrian storm deity Teshub and Hittite storm god
3632520	3640600	Tarhunt. When compared to the neighboring Eastern Arameans, the nature and roles of Canaanite gods
3641240	3649240	seemed remarkably similar. Early Amorite invaders of Mesopotamia previously recognized deities like
3649240	3655560	Baal Haddad and El. Phoenician sailors spread Canaanite religious beliefs to the west,
3656280	3663080	leaving imprints on Greek mythology. This can be seen in the division of power among the
3663080	3673400	Olympian gods Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. Reflecting Hittite, Canaanites, Syrian divisions among Baal,
3673400	3680760	Yam, Moth, or Marduk, and Nenerta. Additionally, Hercules labors echo the tales of the Tyrian
3680760	3693080	Melkhart, who was frequently likened to Hercules. If we bring our attention back to the Elephantine
3693080	3701080	Jews living in Egypt in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE, we notice that Judaism at this time is still
3701080	3710360	polytheistic. The majority of the Aramaic fragments show either Jov, Yahu, or Kunum as the major head
3710360	3717720	of the pantheon, but some, like this Aramaic text, Carpentra Stella says,
3741320	3748440	In the top part of the stele, the Egyptian god of the underworld, Osiris sits on the throne,
3749080	3756280	recognizable with his characteristic crook and flail. Behind him is a goddess dressed in a long
3756280	3763320	skirt, could be Isis or Moth. The table, a lady perhaps, the deceased stands with her arms raised,
3763880	3770360	an adoration pose. In the lower image, the deceased is shown lying on a lying bed.
3770920	3778760	The embalming god Anubis is shown, assisted by the falcon god Horus. The four canopic jugs with
3778760	3784840	the entrails of the deceased are under the bed, with lids likely designed as heads of the four
3784840	3795000	sons of Horus. Emsit, Hopi, Duomatef, Kebehessenuf, Nephthys kneels at the feet of the dead, and Isis
3795000	3808200	is shown at the head. What happened? How is it that when we get to the time of Ptolemy II,
3809000	3815160	the creation of the Septuagint, that we all of a sudden had the monotheistic approach to theology
3815720	3823320	from these Israelites? I think the answer to this question is very simple. The popular philosophy
3823320	3831960	of any given time period is going to dramatically affect the theology of that period. For example,
3832920	3839400	we see how much the Stoics and Epicureans influenced the Middle Platonist, who in turn
3840120	3844280	influenced Christian theologians and church fathers of the second century.
3844280	3848840	But what about the third century BCE? At the time when the Pentateuch was being put together,
3848840	3855800	Platonism was on the rise, along with Aristotle's School of the Peripatetic and the skepticism of
3855800	3861160	Pyrrho. These philosophers, with the resources of the Great Library of Alexandria,
3861720	3868840	with access to thinkers like Zoraster, the Magian, and Heraclitus, some of the earliest thinkers
3868840	3876120	to exhibit monotheistic or skeptic tendencies against the dogmas and superstitions of the day.
3877080	3883640	Initiation here into the ancient mysteries so honored among men mocks holiness.
3884600	3890440	They raised their voices at stone idols as a man might argue with his doorpost.
3890440	3893320	They have understood so little of the gods.
3898520	3905320	Thales was the first master of the School of Athens. He was known for traveling to see the
3905320	3910680	greatest minds of his day in Egypt and Babylon. He taught that water was the first principle,
3911320	3919400	archaic, in which life can spring from. Thales believed in an uncreated being who crafts
3919400	3926840	fuses, nature, which all things are from. In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
3927480	3932280	Now the earth was formless and empty. Darkness was over the surface of the deep,
3932920	3939000	and the spirit of God was hovering over the waters. Notice how water is the first thing that
3939000	3945000	is formed. This is in line with the philosophical thinking of Thales in the School of Athens,
3945000	3951000	and is also possible of the Egyptian sages or Magile Xoraster, believed in something similar.
3951000	3955560	Heraclitus describes Thales as a Phoenician by remote descent.
3956600	3963480	When Thales died, Anaximander became the second master, who was said to be the teacher of Pythagoras,
3963560	3969800	who brought these teachings to Italy. Anaximander is the earliest use of the word
3970600	3978040	eperion, or infinite, limitless, to designate the original first principle of the cosmos, uncreated,
3978040	3984120	beginning of all things. The first philosopher to employ in philosophical context, the term
3984120	3990040	archae, which until then had meant beginning or origin. Anaximander called this something by the
3990040	3997160	name fousis or nature. Next after him was Anaximinis, third master of the School of Athens, from the
3997160	4004920	Melesian school, who was a material monist, who sought to discover the archae, the beginning or
4004920	4013160	origin, the one underlying basis of all things. Anaximinis also believed that air was divine.
4014120	4021240	He identified air with the breath of life, and thus the soul as well as the air and the atmosphere.
4022200	4029240	Only a single sentence long quote by Anaximinis arrives, just as our soul, being air,
4029880	4036360	holds us together, so Numa and air encompass and guard the whole world.
4036760	4045320	This is the first extant source to use the word Numa or breath. Genesis 2.7 says,
4045320	4053160	the Lord God formed man from dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life,
4053960	4063800	the Numa, and the man became a living being. Genesis lines up perfectly with the philosophy
4063800	4076280	of the Presocratics. After Anaximinis you get Heraclitus, who claims to announce an everlasting
4076280	4084040	logos or word, according to which all things are one in some sense. Opposites are necessary for life,
4084040	4091160	but they are unified in a system of balanced exchanges. The world itself consists of a law-like
4091160	4098280	interchange of elements symbolized by fire, and Anaximinis is criticized by Parminides,
4098280	4105080	who starts the School of the Eliatics. He is called the Father of Logic. It is during this time
4105800	4114680	that superstitions and dogmas are being challenged. Anaxagoras would be the next master, Vathens,
4114680	4119400	and his innovative theory of physical nature is encapsulated in the phrase,
4119400	4126280	a portion of everything in everything. Its primary expression is found in the following
4126280	4132600	difficult fragment, and since the portions of both the large and the small are equal in amount,
4133400	4140440	in this way too all things would be in everything, nor can they be separate, but all things have a
4140440	4146200	portion of everything. Since there cannot be as smallest, nothing can be separated or come to
4146200	4152920	be by itself, but as in the beginning now too all things are together, but in all things there are
4152920	4159640	many things equal in amount both in the larger and the smaller of things being separated off.
4161000	4168040	God is one, is also a phrase that is attributed to him, who in response to the challenges imposed
4168040	4174680	by the competing schools of Parminides and Empedocles is able to unify the leading theories of
4174680	4182120	the day. Anaxagoras introduced the concept of the noose, or the cosmic mind, as an ordering force,
4183160	4190440	and one of his students would be Archelaus, the next master of the school, who was also at this
4190440	4197720	time a staunch skeptic and natural philosopher. He is the one who teaches Socrates, and Socrates
4197720	4203240	is the teacher of Plato. Plato would be the one to unify the entire base of knowledge that Athens
4203240	4209400	had been accumulating from the world for the past 200 years and bring them into his dialogues
4209960	4213560	through the character of Socrates, who was his teacher.
4220280	4227560	Plato wrote a dialogue called Timaeus, an exposition of cosmology in which the Demiurge,
4227640	4234680	the agent who takes the pre-existing materials of chaos, arranges them according to the models
4234680	4242200	of eternal forms, produces all physical things of the world, including human bodies. The Demiurge,
4243000	4249480	or the craftsman, if you want to say that, is sometimes thought of as the platonic personification
4250120	4257000	of active reason. What is so striking about this is that the Demiurge is the craftsman of the universe
4257640	4266040	like Yahweh or Ptah or El in the Ugritic text. He is the uncorated creator of the gods and humans
4266040	4273800	alike. Plato's idea of the cosmos is identical to what is taught in Judeo-Christian cosmology
4274440	4281480	in the time when the Pentateuch is put together. Plato, like his predecessors, were challenging
4281480	4288200	the dogmas and superstitions of his day, and he even sought to replace Homer and Hesiod,
4288840	4295480	the two most famous poets of ancient Greece, where most religious ideas of the day
4296840	4303880	are found in the stories about their gods. For instance, take Plato in Republic Book 3
4304520	4310200	through the mouth of Socrates says, There was another motive in purifying religion.
4311160	4317880	Which is to banish fear. For no man can be courageous, who is afraid of death,
4317880	4322520	who believes the tales, which are repeated by the poets concerning the world below.
4324040	4332600	They must be gently requested not to abuse hell or Hades. They may be reminded that their stories
4332600	4340440	are both untrue and discouraging. Nor must they be angry if we expunge obnoxious passages,
4341720	4347960	such as the depressing words of Achilles. I would rather be serving man than rule over the dead.
4349400	4355560	In the verses which tell of the squalid mansions, the senseless shadows, the fitting soul mourning
4355560	4362840	over lost strength and youth, the soul with a gibber going beneath the earth like smoke,
4364440	4369640	or the souls of the suitors which flutter about like bats, the terrors and horrors
4370280	4377720	of cockatice and sticks, ghost and shapeless shades, and the rest of their tartarian nomenclature
4377720	4384520	must vanish. Such tales may have their use, but they are not the proper food for soldiers,
4385160	4392440	as little can we admit the sorrows and sympathies of the Homeric heroes, Achilles the son of Thetis,
4392440	4398440	in tears, throwing ashes on his head, or pacing up and down the seashore in distraction.
4399160	4406840	Or Priam, the cousin of the gods, crying aloud, rolling in the mire. A good man is not prostrated
4406840	4413640	at the loss of children or fortune, neither is death terrible to him, and therefore lamentations
4413720	4419400	over the dead should not be practiced by men of note, they should be the concern of inferior
4419400	4426440	persons only, whether women or men. Still worst is the attribution of such weakness to the gods,
4426440	4433400	as when the goddess say, a loss may travail, and the worst of all, when the king of heaven himself
4433400	4440200	laments in the inability to save Hector, or sorrows over the impending doom of his dear Sarpadam.
4441160	4447400	Such a character of God is not ridiculed by our young men, is likely to be imitated by them,
4448120	4453400	nor should our citizens be given the excess laughter. Such violent delights are followed
4453400	4459640	by violent reaction. The description in the Iliad of the gods, shaking their sides at their
4459640	4466360	clumsiness of Hephaestus, will not be admitted by us, certainly not.
4472600	4480920	Plato is clearly not satisfied with the pagan religions of his day, and wants to replace it
4480920	4488920	with a more up-to-date or mature theology, with a perfect god who has no mistakes and is never
4488920	4495800	depicted doing anything that we can look at as weak. Plato says, let us declare then for what
4495800	4505160	caused nature, and this all was framed by him that framed it. He was good, and in none that is good
4505160	4512280	can there arise jealousy of ought at any time. So being far aloof from this, he desired that all
4512280	4519720	things should be as like unto himself as possible. This is that the most sovereign cause of nature
4519720	4525640	in the universe, which we shall most surely be right in accepting from men of understanding,
4526280	4531560	for God desiring that all things should be good, and that so far as this might be,
4531560	4537080	there should be not evil having received all that is visible, not in a state of rest,
4537080	4542520	but moving without harmony or measure, brought it from its disorder into order,
4543400	4549560	thinking that this was all in ways better than the other. And Plato continues,
4550120	4556680	in the forming the universe, he curated reason in soul and soul and body, that he might be the
4556680	4564360	maker of a work that was by nature the most fair and perfect. In this way then, we ought to affirm
4564360	4571640	according to probable account that this universe is a living creature and very truth possessing soul
4571640	4574520	and reason by the providence of God.
4581160	4588200	Plato also rejected Athenian democracy in favor of a republic guided by a priesthood
4588840	4594760	and a philosopher king, whose laws were given by the gods and are the most ancient and holy.
4595720	4602680	He rejected even things he once said were great before, such as the Dionysian mysteries of love
4602680	4610520	and passion, which he now argues in his last work are empty pleasures. For instance, in his last work
4610520	4617880	On Laws, 636b, these common meals, for example, and these gymnasia,
4618600	4623000	while they are at present beneficial to the states and many other respects,
4623800	4631640	yet in the event of civil strife, they prove dangerous. And moreover, this institution,
4631640	4637640	one of old standing, is thought to have corrupted the pleasures of love which are natural not to
4638520	4645080	men, but also natural to beast. For this, your states are held primarily responsible
4645080	4650200	and along with them all others that are especially encouraged the use of the gymnasia.
4651800	4656200	And whether one makes the observation in earnest or in jests, one certainly should not fail to
4656200	4662280	observe that when a male unites with female for the procreation, the pleasure, experience is held
4662280	4669400	to be due to nature, but contrary to nature, when male mates with male or female with female,
4669960	4675400	and that those first guilty of such enormities were impelled by their slavery to pleasure.
4676280	4685400	And we all accuse the Cretans of concocting the story about Ganymede to justify unnatural pleasures.
4686360	4689800	In case you didn't know, Ganymede was the boy lover of Zeus.
4690680	4697240	When we look at this, in context to the story of Maccabees, you see the laws enacted and followed
4697240	4703480	by none other than the Maccabee dynasty, who revolts against the Greek pagan king Antiochus
4703480	4711080	IV for putting a gymnasium in Jerusalem, which they called an abomination. Looks like Judas
4711080	4717320	Maccabees and Plato believe the same thing about gymnasiums. I also think there is clear ties to
4717320	4723960	ancient Babylon, Assyrian and Sumerian laws, stories woven in the text. These are in no doubt in my
4723960	4730600	mind authentic and ancient Near Eastern texts that the Greeks inherit from the Jews. For example,
4730600	4736760	Deuteronomy, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, is clearly an ancient law that we see present
4736760	4743480	in Hammurabi's code. As Plato said in the Republic, though, for people to respect the laws,
4743480	4750280	they need to be the most ancient and given by the gods from the oldest times. But I also think
4750280	4757720	there is no reason to believe that the philosophers and scribes of Alexandria, like Demetrius Filarium,
4758600	4761640	did not have any oversight over what was written and edited.
4769880	4776200	What solid evidence do we have that Platonism has any influence on Judaism? If we continue down our
4776200	4782680	line of masters, schools, methods, as I trace the roots of Thales down to Plato,
4782680	4788600	the next three school masters after Plato is Aristotle, who, after the conquest of Alexander
4788600	4795880	the Great, is sent into exile by the Ellusinian priest, who charged Aristotle with blasphemy
4795880	4803400	against the gods, and Aristotle is replaced by Theophrastus, who was also charged by the Athenian
4803400	4809560	religious leaders with blasphemy against the gods. Now keep in mind, all of this is happening after
4809560	4815480	Socrates. What is happening with these masters of Athens being at odds with the religious leaders
4815480	4821160	of the priests of the Ellusinians? They're obviously challenging the dogmas and superstitions.
4822280	4829240	Now Theophrastus was the student and new master of the school who taught Demetrius Filarium.
4829880	4836360	Demetrius Filarium was also exiled, and he moves to Alexandria with Pierrot the Skeptic
4837080	4843640	after traveling the world with Alexander the Great, meeting Brahmins and Magi and living
4843640	4849880	amongst the Chaldeans and Babylon, and they went down to the court of Ptolemy and Alexandria
4850440	4857400	to help build the library. According to multiple sources, Demetrius Filarium was trying to collect
4857400	4863240	all the books in the inhabitable world and was commissioned by Ptolemy to translate the laws
4863320	4870760	of the Jews into Greek. In my personal opinion, it is at this time when the Pentateuch is put
4870760	4877960	together in its current monotheistic form, with influences from the Platonist of the time period.
4877960	4886360	You see, we have a direct line from Thales the Presocratics all the way down to Plato
4887240	4896600	and then continuing down to Demetrius who moves to Alexandria Egypt and creates the Pentateuch.
4898120	4904920	Here's what Josephus says about this. When Alexander had reigned 12 years and after him
4904920	4910360	Ptolemy sought her 40 years, Philadelphius then took the kingdom of Egypt and held it 40 years
4910360	4917800	within one. He procured the law to be interpreted and set free those who come from Jerusalem into
4917800	4926200	Egypt and were in slavery there, who were 120,000. The occasion was this. Demetrius Filarius,
4926200	4932360	who was library keeper to the king, was now endeavoring, if it were possible, to gather
4932360	4938440	together all the books that were in the inhabitable earth. And buying whatsoever was anywhere valuable
4938520	4944360	or agreeable to the king's inclination, which inclination of his Demetrius was zealously subservient.
4945080	4950440	And when once Ptolemy asked him how many tens of thousands of books he had collected, he replied
4950440	4957400	that he already had 20 times 10,000, but that in a little time he should have 50 times 10,000.
4958920	4964440	But be said, he had been informed that there are many books of the laws among the Jews worthy
4964440	4970440	of inquiring for and worthy of the king's library, but which, being written of characters and in
4970440	4976120	dialect of their own, will cause no small pains in getting them translated into the Greek tongue,
4976120	4979960	that the character in which they are written seems to be like that which is proper to the
4979960	4985720	character of the Syrians, and that its sound when pronounced is like theirs also, and that this sound
4985720	4992120	appears to be peculiar to themselves, wherefore he said that nothing hindered why they might not get
4992120	4997080	those books to be translated also. For while nothing is wanting that is necessary for that
4997080	5003240	purpose, we may have their books also in this library. So the king thought that Demetrius was
5003240	5008120	very zealous to procure him an abundance of books, and that he suggested that this was exceeding
5008120	5013880	proper for him to do, and therefore he wrote to the Jewish high priest that he should act accordingly.
5014600	5021160	Demetrius wrote in a letter, It is not fit for us, O king, to overlook things hastily
5021160	5027800	or to deceive ourselves, but to lay the truth open, for since we have determined not only to get
5027800	5034280	the laws of the Jews transcribed, but interpreted also, for thy satisfaction, by what means can we
5034280	5040280	do this, while so many of the Jews are now slaves in thy kingdom. For both these people, and we also
5040280	5047960	worship the same God, the framer of all things, we call him, and that truly by the Greek Xena,
5048520	5055240	or Jupiter, because he breathes life into all men, wherefore do thou restore these men
5055800	5062440	to their own country, and that this do the honor of God, because these men pay a peculiar excellent
5062440	5068440	worship to him. Known as how Demetrius is already comparing his framer of all things,
5069080	5074280	the divine craftsman or demiurge, who he was most likely comparing to Yahweh in order to
5074280	5081400	unify this God with Jupiter. Keep in mind, less than a century before this, the fragments of the
5081400	5090360	Jewish communities that we have are still polytheistic. We have a direct line from the masters of the
5090360	5097960	Athens Academy, from Thales all the way down to Demetrius, who is writing this letter to the Jews,
5098600	5104680	who is the face of the creation of the Pentateuch. I think there is more than enough evidence to
5104680	5110600	lay this argument out, that this is the beginning of the trend of monotheism, and at this time,
5110600	5116920	the priestshoods of Yahweh and El, synced with that of the craftsmen and demiurgic
5116920	5124360	creator gods of Egypt and Greece, Yahweh of the Elohim, and the God who has its roots all over
5124360	5132200	Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean world, such as Kronos, El, Pita, Yahweh, or Zeus, or Amen Ra.
5133800	5139960	The so-called pagans that lived after this time period also adopt the same monist trends
5140520	5147960	the Judeo-Christians adopt. The soul-invictus religion would come from that and the neoplateness
5147960	5155960	philosophers and theurgists were no exception to this. The Chaldean oracles also show a
5156760	5163960	one who is above all gods. The philosophy of the time, Platonism to Middle Platonism,
5163960	5170280	and eventually Neoplatonism, would continue to influence the theology of whatever time matched it.
5170920	5183880	I'll leave you with this. In a text from Plutarch called Moralia, he says,
5184680	5192440	moreover, most people believe that Amon is the name given to Zeus in the land of the Egyptians,
5193240	5201880	a name which we, with a slight alteration, pronounce Amon. But Menitho of Seventus thinks that the
5201880	5210600	meaning concealed or concealment lies in this word. Hecateus of Abdera says that the Egyptians
5210600	5217000	use the expression one to another whenever they call to anyone. For the word is a form of address
5217880	5224680	when they therefore address the supreme god whom they believe to be the same as the universe as
5224680	5232680	if he were invisible, concealed, and implore him to make visible himself and manifest to them.
5232680	5239720	They use the word Amen. So great then was the circumspection of the Egyptians and their wisdom
5239720	5245320	touching all that had to do with the gods. Plutarch is proposing that the term Amen
5246040	5254520	is a shout or chant that is used to call on any of the gods, not just Amon, but any of the gods
5254520	5262200	including the supreme invisible one. He also cites Hecateus of Abdera for this very idea. And it
5262200	5270680	turns out the Hecateus of Abdera is the oldest fragment that we have, citation of Moses outside
5270680	5283640	of the Hebrew Bible. Let me know what you guys think about this stuff. Leave it in the comments,
