00:00.000 --> 00:02.400
Angra Minu, right? What is this Angra Minu?

00:02.400 --> 00:05.100
Gere constrain, constricted.

00:05.100 --> 00:12.800
This is the force, or counter force, is constraining progress, is suffocating life.

00:12.800 --> 00:16.600
It means that Hora Mazda is not omnipotent, okay?

00:16.600 --> 00:18.800
He's neither omnipotent nor omniscient.

00:18.800 --> 00:22.900
And this is really important because many theologians have recognized,

00:22.900 --> 00:27.900
and on account of this fact, Zoroastrianism doesn't face the problem of evil.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
In any religion where you have an omniscient and omnipotent God,

00:31.000 --> 00:34.300
you know, there's the problem of God being responsible for all the evil in the world,

00:34.300 --> 00:37.700
you cannot have free will and have an omnipotent and omniscient God.

00:37.700 --> 00:43.300
Observe, discern, and choose which of the forces you want to align yourself with.

00:43.300 --> 00:46.300
The Devas are aligned with Angra Minu.

00:46.300 --> 00:49.300
There is this very strange passage in the Gathus,

00:49.300 --> 00:54.000
which if you ask me aligns with the myth of Atlantis that you find in Plato,

00:54.000 --> 00:58.300
that when the Devas were deliberating, Angra Minu came in

00:58.300 --> 01:02.500
and he as a great deceiver confused their deliberations

01:02.500 --> 01:06.000
and they rushed in wrath and destroyed the life of mankind.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.200
Well, what is this talking about?

01:07.200 --> 01:10.600
This is talking about when Zeus calls a convocation of the Olympians

01:10.600 --> 01:14.900
and they decide to destroy the world through a great deluge, right?

01:14.900 --> 01:22.100
And in particular, they're targeting the Atlanteans who have rebelled against Olympus.

01:22.100 --> 01:25.900
So the Devas, the gods are aligned with Angra Minu or Ahrim.

01:25.900 --> 01:28.200
Notice now the Gnostic structure is already becoming clear.

01:28.200 --> 01:31.000
These heavenly powers that stand between us

01:31.000 --> 01:34.400
and the true divine intelligence of the cosmos.

01:34.400 --> 01:36.900
So the Devas are the Archons.

01:36.900 --> 01:41.400
Zarathustra's take on the Devas or Deves, they are the Archons.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.500
They're the prototype for the Gnostic Archon.

01:53.100 --> 01:59.400
Welcome back to the Gnostic Informant and you are about to attain true Gnosis.

01:59.400 --> 02:06.700
And I'm with Dr. Jason Giorgiani today, author of Prometheism and lovers of Sophia.

02:06.700 --> 02:10.200
And guys, this is once in a while I get him on.

02:10.200 --> 02:12.200
Last time he was on, everybody loved it.

02:12.200 --> 02:17.700
So we're going to go deep this time into Zoroaster and the roots of Gnosticism.

02:17.700 --> 02:23.500
And you might not know the roots of Gnosticism are not in the Greco-Roman world.

02:23.500 --> 02:26.100
They're in the East, they're in Persia.

02:26.100 --> 02:28.700
And we're about to demonstrate that in this conversation.

02:28.700 --> 02:30.200
So how are you doing today?

02:30.200 --> 02:33.100
It's great to be with you, Neil.

02:33.100 --> 02:37.600
You know, I had been meaning to come back on the show earlier

02:37.600 --> 02:42.100
and I do occasionally watch your programs and really looking forward to this opportunity

02:42.100 --> 02:49.600
to familiarize your audience with potentially the Persian origins of Gnosticism.

02:49.600 --> 02:50.800
Yeah, this will be fun.

02:50.800 --> 02:53.300
So why don't we start with Zoroaster?

02:53.300 --> 02:55.700
Why don't we start with who is he?

02:55.700 --> 02:56.700
What is his teachings?

02:56.700 --> 02:58.000
There's the Gathas.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.800
There's the San Mnvesta.

03:00.800 --> 03:01.900
What is it?

03:01.900 --> 03:04.500
Let's get to the start of all this and who this guy is.

03:04.500 --> 03:05.400
What time period?

03:05.400 --> 03:06.600
All that.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.200
Right.

03:07.200 --> 03:18.700
So the Gathas are a text that's been, you know, extremely controversial and polarizing

03:18.700 --> 03:25.300
in the scholarly community, not only within Iranology or Iranian studies itself,

03:25.300 --> 03:28.100
but in the broader field of Indo-European studies.

03:28.100 --> 03:32.200
There's been great controversy about the date of this text.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.100
And so, but let me just start with its name for a minute.

03:35.100 --> 03:36.700
Gathas.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.000
Gatha, okay.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.300
So of course, the language in which this text is composed, this ancient Iranian language

03:43.300 --> 03:45.900
is a sister language of Sanskrit.

03:45.900 --> 03:52.000
In fact, it's very close to Sanskrit and this factors into the dating debates over this text.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.400
So the word Gatha is the cognate of the word Gita.

03:55.400 --> 04:00.400
So Gita like Bhagavad Gita, Gatha is the cognate of Gita.

04:00.400 --> 04:05.300
And it's related to the word Gath in the Germanic languages.

04:05.300 --> 04:16.200
So Gathic, Gita and Gathas are all related and they have something to do with a hymn of praise.

04:16.200 --> 04:16.700
Okay.

04:16.700 --> 04:19.600
And having to do with the divine with God.

04:19.600 --> 04:22.400
Got in German means God, right?

04:22.400 --> 04:28.100
And Gita means sort of song of praise or hymn of praise.

04:28.100 --> 04:33.300
So that's the meaning of the word for this text, the name of this text.

04:33.300 --> 04:38.200
And it brings us into the question of dating it based on its linguistics.

04:38.200 --> 04:47.700
So the problem is that this language that the Gathas is composed in and it was believed by some

04:47.700 --> 04:50.500
to have been an oral text that was only subsequently written down.

04:50.500 --> 04:53.000
I'll tell you why I don't agree with that.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.100
But this language is very close to Rig Vetic.

04:56.100 --> 04:56.800
Okay.

04:56.800 --> 05:03.500
So it's like a really ancient form of similar to an ancient form of Sanskrit much older than

05:03.500 --> 05:08.500
the Sanskrit of the Bhagavad Gita's older than the younger Upanishads.

05:08.500 --> 05:17.300
And so people have assumed some scholars have that it dates from like 1500 to 1000 BC.

05:17.300 --> 05:26.200
So either slightly older or contain slightly older than or contemporaneous with the Upanishads.

05:26.200 --> 05:33.500
And or with the Vedas somewhere between the Vedas and the Upanishad.

05:33.500 --> 05:41.200
But the problem is that if you compare the Gathas to the Vedas, the level of philosophical

05:41.200 --> 05:48.700
complexity in this text and the first person narrative style of it doesn't mesh at all

05:48.700 --> 05:51.200
with Rig Vetic culture.

05:51.200 --> 05:57.400
Stylistically what you find in the Gathas is very much of a piece with pre-Socratic philosophy.

05:57.400 --> 06:02.700
It reads like Parmenides or Heraclitus or something like that.

06:02.700 --> 06:03.100
Okay.

06:03.100 --> 06:07.100
It's a profoundly philosophical text, very complex conceptually.

06:07.100 --> 06:12.700
And it's also written in the first person, which makes it in a way even more modern than

06:12.700 --> 06:14.700
the pre-Socratic Greeks.

06:14.700 --> 06:18.700
This is like a guy telling you what he thinks about the world and even mentioning his friends

06:18.700 --> 06:20.700
and stuff that he's been through in his life.

06:20.700 --> 06:27.200
And not at all in this anonymous mythic style of composition that we find in the Upanishads

06:27.200 --> 06:32.200
or even in Homer or any text of that degree of antiquity.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.700
It's almost modern in its style.

06:34.700 --> 06:43.700
It's like the idiom that you start to find in classical Athens and then that becomes very popular in the Roman Empire.

06:43.700 --> 06:52.200
Okay. So for that reason, I really question, you know, dating this to 1000 to 1500 BC.

06:52.200 --> 06:57.200
I also question it because there's a big religious conflict that's depicted in this text.

06:57.200 --> 07:01.700
Zarathustra is a rebel against some existing priestly order.

07:01.700 --> 07:10.700
He is basically engaging in a kind of spiritual philosophical insurrection against both ritualistic sacrificial priests

07:11.200 --> 07:14.200
and these warlord princes.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.200
And he calls these the catapun.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.200
Catapun is a word that becomes borbon later.

07:19.200 --> 07:23.200
It means sacrifice, sacrificial mumbling priests.

07:23.200 --> 07:29.200
He calls them and he means like the way they mindlessly recite all these, you know, hymns and mantras and so forth.

07:29.200 --> 07:34.200
And then these warlord princes called the Kavis.

07:34.700 --> 07:42.700
And so, you know, people have assumed this refers to Rig Vedic priests and the Rig Vedic Shatriya or princely class.

07:42.700 --> 07:51.700
But actually, if you look in the details of the text, you see, it fits much more the context of Scythian Mithraism.

07:51.700 --> 08:02.700
The kind of, as he describes them, mad drunken warlords that go on cattle raids that are the backdrop for the message of the Gathas,

08:02.700 --> 08:14.200
fit the Scythian warlords who were coming down into the Persian and Median territories around 700, 600 B.C.

08:14.200 --> 08:20.200
and raiding the farmlands of the settled population in Persia and media.

08:20.200 --> 08:31.200
And just to bunch it real quick, just in case anyone doesn't know, archaeology reflects how widespread these Mithraic temples and places were

08:31.700 --> 08:35.700
from Britain all the way to like Siberia, basically in the Bronze Age.

08:35.700 --> 08:37.700
But yeah, I just wanted to just throw that in there.

08:37.700 --> 08:38.700
Yeah, yeah.

08:38.700 --> 08:43.700
And let me just also throw in a note on a completely, you know, different tangent.

08:43.700 --> 08:46.700
If anyone hears background noise, I must apologize.

08:46.700 --> 08:51.700
I'm in New York City and being in Manhattan in particular, one of the things you have to deal with is constant construction.

08:51.700 --> 08:55.700
There's a huge, hopefully they're going to be on their lunch break right now and we won't have to deal with them.

08:55.700 --> 08:56.700
But we'll see.

08:56.700 --> 09:03.200
In any case, so the backdrop of Zarathustra is ancient Iranian Mithraism, if you ask me.

09:03.200 --> 09:08.200
That's what the details of the Gathas really, you know, aligned with.

09:08.200 --> 09:14.200
And also we have to consider two events in this man's life.

09:14.200 --> 09:16.200
One, his self-exile.

09:16.200 --> 09:26.200
Apparently, his message was so revolutionary and he was so badly persecuted for wherever he was born and raised that he had to migrate over a long distance

09:26.200 --> 09:30.700
and accept the patronage of this king called Vishtaspa.

09:30.700 --> 09:39.700
This feudal lord or, you know, petty king called Vishtaspa, Kavi Vishtaspa or Kegoshtasp in the later Persian.

09:39.700 --> 09:45.200
And it appears that the court of Kegoshtasp was in present day Khurasan.

09:45.200 --> 09:52.700
That's northeastern Iran, right under Turkmenistan and next to Afghanistan, next to the Afghan border.

09:52.700 --> 09:57.200
And so the point being, he wasn't from there, okay?

09:57.200 --> 09:59.200
There's a debate over where he was from as well.

09:59.200 --> 10:09.700
But if that's where Goshtaspa court was, then he came to there from somewhere else and it lends more credence to the Zoroastrian biographies,

10:09.700 --> 10:16.700
later written Zoroastrian biographies that suggest he was from Azerbaijan, from the province of Iran known as Azerbaijan,

10:16.700 --> 10:21.700
the ancient name of which was Azar Padeghan, meaning the bastion of the fire.

10:21.700 --> 10:29.200
And it was a mainly median territory and the Magi were the traditional priests of the Medes.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.200
So that makes sense.

10:31.200 --> 10:40.200
And it makes sense that this guy pissed off mythraic priests in media, greater media.

10:40.700 --> 10:51.700
And he had to basically go into self-exile, flee for his life, to Khurasan, to northeastern Iran, going towards Central Asia.

10:51.700 --> 10:55.200
And so, okay, why is this relevant to the date?

10:55.200 --> 11:07.700
Because Zarathustra is killed in some kind of an invasion by people called Turanian in the Shahnameh, in the Iranian national epic.

11:08.200 --> 11:13.700
These people are called Turanians. They come from a place called Turan, which is in Central Asia.

11:13.700 --> 11:18.200
And this is another name for the Sakhas or the Skithian people.

11:18.200 --> 11:21.700
They were descended from a guy called Tur.

11:21.700 --> 11:26.700
And so one name for them are the Turanians. We know them in the West as the Skithians.

11:26.700 --> 11:32.700
When was there a Skithian rampage like this of Khurasan where someone like Zarathustra could have been killed?

11:32.700 --> 11:44.700
It took place in about, let's say, it was the time when Cyrus the Great had overthrown the Median Kingdom.

11:44.700 --> 11:51.700
And the Median Kingdom, its border had come right up against Central Asia, okay?

11:51.700 --> 11:54.700
And so right up against Skithian territory.

11:54.700 --> 12:03.700
And when Cyrus the Great, the founder of the First Persian Empire, when he overthrew his grandfather, Astyages of Media,

12:03.700 --> 12:08.700
there was this vacuum of power briefly where there was chaos. Nobody knew who was really in charge.

12:08.700 --> 12:13.700
And so the Skithians came down and they overran the Medes and the Persians for a brief period of time.

12:13.700 --> 12:21.700
So it looks like this puts Zarathustra at the date which the Zarastrians themselves claimed he lived.

12:21.700 --> 12:31.700
And they say that conventional Zarastrian scriptures say that Zarathustra was 258 years before Alexander.

12:31.700 --> 12:41.700
And what they mean is 258 years not before the birth of Alexander, but before the coming of Alexander to Iran, before his invasion of the Persian Empire.

12:41.700 --> 12:47.700
And so that puts Zarathustra in the generation before Cyrus.

12:47.700 --> 12:58.700
And so this means that Zarathustra was an old man at the time when Cyrus the Great had overthrown, you know, Astyages of Media and was trying to form the Persian Empire.

12:58.700 --> 13:07.700
So those dates all aligned perfectly. And that also puts us right at the dawn of philosophy, right?

13:07.700 --> 13:20.700
I mean these pre-Socratics, Heraclitus, immediately before him Pythagoras, and so forth, Parmenides after Heraclitus, these are all in the like 500s, okay, 500s BC.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.700
Explosion of intellect.

13:22.700 --> 13:30.700
Exactly. So if you put Zarathustra in 1500 or 1000 BC, it doesn't make any sense in terms of the intellectual context.

13:30.700 --> 13:32.700
I mean, he would be a total anomaly.

13:32.700 --> 13:38.700
If you put Zarathustra at, let's see, what would it be?

13:38.700 --> 13:48.700
It would be 628 BC. If we go by the conventional Zoroastrian dating, he would have been born in 628 BC.

13:48.700 --> 13:58.700
And that means that considering the fact they claim he composed the Gathas in his 40s, it would have been around 580 BC when Zarathustra composed the Gathas.

13:58.700 --> 14:05.700
Well, that's perfect. That would mean that Zarathustra was the first pre-Socratic philosopher. He has the distinction of being the first.

14:05.700 --> 14:16.700
And he would then have immediately influenced the subsequent pre-Socratic thinkers, especially as we're going to discuss Pythagoras and Heraclitus.

14:16.700 --> 14:23.700
And he would have influenced them by virtue of the fact that the Persian Empire conquered Ionia, which was the Greek bastion of philosophy.

14:23.700 --> 14:27.700
So I think this is the proper matrix for dating Zarathustra.

14:27.700 --> 14:32.700
I think that also puts him in the same timeline as people like Isaiah and Hosea.

14:32.700 --> 14:42.700
And that's interesting because that's a time period where the world just kind of just shifts in its paradigm for all these ideas.

14:42.700 --> 14:50.700
But my question is before we continue is why do people think that he's born in 1500 BC? Where did that even come from?

14:50.700 --> 15:01.700
Yeah, linguistics alone. And so let me say one other thing about this. There is no other evidence based really upon which to base this thesis other than linguistics.

15:01.700 --> 15:10.700
In other words, the fact that the idiom of the Gathas is similar to Rigvedic Sanskrit.

15:11.700 --> 15:13.700
Okay, but look at Latin.

15:13.700 --> 15:14.700
Yeah.

15:14.700 --> 15:30.700
So, you know, we have René Descartes in the 1600s, late 1500s, early 1600s, early 1600s. We have René Descartes composing in Latin.

15:30.700 --> 15:31.700
That's true.

15:31.700 --> 15:42.700
Latin was used by, you know, scholars throughout the whole Middle Ages, a thousand years after the fall of the Roman Empire and of Latin having been used as a living spoken language.

15:42.700 --> 15:43.700
So, okay.

15:43.700 --> 15:44.700
For the commoner.

15:44.700 --> 15:46.700
For the commoner, Cicero's writing in Latin.

15:46.700 --> 15:50.700
Exactly. So Latin was a dead language for a thousand years or more.

15:50.700 --> 15:51.700
What?

15:52.700 --> 16:10.700
You know, by the time that it was still being used as a language that would confer a degree of scholastic authority on a person composing a text, either theological or intellectual authority was conveyed by composing in this dead language of Latin.

16:10.700 --> 16:23.700
So why wouldn't we think that a Mead or Persian, it's debatable which Sarathustra was, he was an Iranian in any case, these are two different branches of the Iranian family, the Meads and the Persians and the Skithians.

16:23.700 --> 16:29.700
These were the three major branches, okay, of the Iranian family in those days.

16:29.700 --> 16:49.700
So why would we not think that a Mead or a Persian might use this dead language, which was the language of the Magi and of the Rig Vedic priests to confer authority upon the text that he was composing, whereas it wasn't his spoken living language for all we know the guy spoke Persian.

16:49.700 --> 16:52.700
Good point. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Okay.

16:52.700 --> 17:02.700
So now that we, now we're in the time period, we sort of understand the context. And let's go from there. What stems from this, this sort of age of Sarathustra?

17:02.700 --> 17:21.700
Right, so his message is absolutely revolutionary. To understand that we need to just take a quick look again, or have a refresher, because your audience I'm sure is largely familiar with this, but let's just, you know, have a refresher of the basics of Greek theology, ancient Greek theology,

17:21.700 --> 17:43.700
and how it lines up with the, the other end of the Indo European spectrum, namely Vedic theology. So one thing that the Greeks and their, you know, their Eastern brothers still agreed on, around about 600 BC, was that the beings worthy of worship are these gods,

17:43.700 --> 17:54.700
right? The Greeks, you know, worship these Olympian gods. And in the Vedic pantheon, you have their analog in terms of the Devas, led by Indra, and Indra is Zeus.

17:54.700 --> 17:56.700
Okay, it's a very direct.

17:57.700 --> 18:16.700
The Devas is Indra. And, you know, so the Olympian pantheon and the Vedic pantheon are very much, you know, the same, and they devolved from a primordial Indo European religion, a single primordial Indo European religion, we know this through linguistics and anthropology and

18:16.700 --> 18:32.700
archaeology. Just, just the fact that Diaz-Pater shows up in Spain and Italy, and also all the way in India. There you go, you have a clear something to look at, you have tangible something to look at, that shows you this is a widespread ancient language that's spread across the entire

18:33.700 --> 18:53.700
hemisphere. Yeah, he's a thunderbolt wielding skyfather warlord deity. That's Indra or Zeus. And he leads this pantheon. Okay. And there are these sacrificial priests who are orienting all of human worship toward this pantheon.

18:53.700 --> 19:10.700
And humanity has this subservient, not to say servile relationship to these gods who are extremely tyrannical and capricious and frankly, at times sadistic. And this is true both in, you know, Greek religion and ancient Vedic religion.

19:11.700 --> 19:25.700
And then there's another class of beings that you see both in Greek religion and Vedic religion, and those are the Titans and these Titans are opposed to the gods. The Vedic people called them ashuras.

19:25.700 --> 19:46.700
And this is very significant because the chief deity of Zarathustra is Ahura Mazda. And Ahura, just like, you know, Gita and Gatha. Ahura is the Iranian cognate of the Vedic ashura. So Ahura Mazda, Mazda means wisdom.

19:47.700 --> 20:01.700
Ahura Mazda is the Titan or the ashura of wisdom. So right away, what Zarathustra is doing is inverting the entire theological worldview of the Indo Europeans 180 degrees.

20:02.700 --> 20:16.700
He preaches in the Gathas that the devas are sadistic, tyrannical, and above all deceptive. He says that their chief attribute is duruj, or the lie. They're great deceivers. And they're oppressors of mankind.

20:17.700 --> 20:33.700
And above all, they're trying to deny us wisdom and knowledge. So we ought to align ourselves with Titanic wisdom and rebel against these gods. So it's a message of insurrection that we find in the Gathas.

20:33.700 --> 20:43.700
Insurrection against the entire heavenly order, which was common to the Greeks and the Vedic people. Okay, so you can see why this guy had to flee for his life.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.700
Right. Yeah.

20:45.700 --> 20:54.700
Now, who would, who would have, if Ahura Mazda trans, what, what's, is there a God in the, in the ancient Greeks, Pantheon that relates to?

20:54.700 --> 20:56.700
Hell yeah, there is. Hell yeah, there is.

20:56.700 --> 20:58.700
I guess. Is it our nose?

20:58.700 --> 20:59.700
No.

20:59.700 --> 21:00.700
Okay.

21:00.700 --> 21:11.700
But it's interesting because I'll say something about our nose later in, in a moment, you know, in response to this, but, okay, so let's lay this out really briefly for a minute.

21:11.700 --> 21:17.700
And I'm going to come back to these attributes of Ahura Mazda momentarily, but just to answer your question.

21:17.700 --> 21:31.700
First of all, we've got the name Titan of wisdom. Okay, who's a Titan who's associated with wisdom? Second, the chief attribute of Ahura Mazda is forward thinking or thinking ahead.

21:32.700 --> 21:41.700
And I'll come back to this thinking, whoa, wait a minute, thinking ahead. And number three, what is the element that symbolizes cosmic order?

21:41.700 --> 21:47.700
That's, that's an expression of the mind of Ahura Mazda fire and ever burning fire.

21:47.700 --> 21:48.700
I got it.

21:48.700 --> 21:50.700
Oh, okay. So who is Ahura Mazda?

21:50.700 --> 21:51.700
Prometheus.

21:51.700 --> 21:52.700
Yeah.

21:52.700 --> 22:10.700
Okay. Clearly, Ahura Mazda is a philosophical concept that's been developed on the basis of an older Indo-European myth of Prometheus, which you find in its original form, not in Greece, but in Iran.

22:10.700 --> 22:12.700
He's a creator too.

22:12.700 --> 22:18.700
Yeah, and he's the creator. He's the creator of mankind. Okay. He created us in his image.

22:18.700 --> 22:25.700
So to think for ourselves and not to worship these tyrannical Olympians, we'll come back to that.

22:25.700 --> 22:31.700
But the myth of Prometheus, a lot of people might not realize doesn't come from Greece. It comes from Iran originally.

22:31.700 --> 22:40.700
The whole Caucasus was part of Iran until the Russian Zars took it from Iran in the 1800s.

22:40.700 --> 22:42.700
Wow, it's a long time.

22:42.700 --> 22:46.700
Okay, so the Caucasus is the cradle of Iranian civilization.

22:46.700 --> 22:55.700
And the myth of Prometheus in its original form is still found in the Caucasus in terms of the cult of Amirani.

22:55.700 --> 23:07.700
There's this figure called Amirani, and he's clearly, if you look at the structure of the myth, he's Prometheus, and they still worship him in the folk religion of Georgia.

23:07.700 --> 23:13.700
And there are statues of him in the countryside of Georgia in the Caucasus Mountains where, of course, Prometheus has changed.

23:13.700 --> 23:19.700
In the myth, Prometheus, when he's punished by Zeus, he's changed from Caucasus Mountains.

23:19.700 --> 23:36.700
So the whole ancient Indo-European fire cult of Prometheus, I believe, was the raw material with which Zarathustra was working when he developed this philosophically complex notion of Ahura Mazda.

23:36.700 --> 23:38.700
That's fascinating.

23:38.700 --> 23:44.700
But I mentioned forethought.

23:44.700 --> 23:56.700
Ahura Mazda emanates seven powers or seven facets of his divine intelligence.

23:56.700 --> 24:03.700
And these are called the Amesha Spentas, and the fact that it's seven is going to be relevant to our discussion of his Zarathustra's influence on Gnosticism.

24:03.700 --> 24:05.700
Okay, so bear that in mind.

24:05.700 --> 24:15.700
So they're the seven powers, and the foremost of these is Sepanto Minu, which, as I mentioned, is translated into Greek as Prometheus.

24:15.700 --> 24:17.700
Forward thinking.

24:17.700 --> 24:18.700
Thinking ahead.

24:18.700 --> 24:22.700
The progressive mentality is one good translation of it.

24:22.700 --> 24:27.700
Sepanto, progressive, forward-oriented, Minu mentality, mind.

24:27.700 --> 24:28.700
Sepanto Minu.

24:28.700 --> 24:38.700
And this is the foremost of the seven powers that express, you know, Ahura Mazda in the cosmos.

24:38.700 --> 24:50.700
The second one is something called Asha Vahishta, and Asha became Artha in the language of the Persian Empire, and this means cosmic order.

24:51.700 --> 24:58.700
It's basically the Greek notion cosmos, which, by the way, had not been formed yet at that time. It's going to be formed as we'll discuss in Heraclitus.

24:58.700 --> 25:07.700
So this notion of cosmic order is the second manifestation of this of Ahura Mazda, Asha Vahishta.

25:07.700 --> 25:09.700
It means the best order, literally.

25:09.700 --> 25:10.700
That's the translation of it.

25:10.700 --> 25:14.700
Asha order, Vahishta the best, namely cosmic order.

25:14.700 --> 25:20.700
And we've got, and that, and very significantly, let me not gloss over the fact that Asha Vahishta symbolized by fire.

25:20.700 --> 25:25.700
That's the ever-burning fire, which always changes its forms, but it's the same substrate.

25:25.700 --> 25:27.700
In other words, energy.

25:27.700 --> 25:31.700
Energy, the cosmos is basically its ever-transforming energy.

25:31.700 --> 25:37.700
Is this that monad that people attribute to his teachings?

25:37.700 --> 25:39.700
We'll get into that.

25:39.700 --> 25:46.700
I think that, in my view, Zarathustra is neither a monist nor a dualist.

25:46.700 --> 25:48.700
His view is more nuanced than that.

25:48.700 --> 26:01.700
But I think that his view influenced both monism and it influenced both the Valentinian type of Gnosticism and also the Manichaean dualistic type of Gnosticism.

26:01.700 --> 26:11.700
Okay, so then the third one after Asha Vahishta, we could say, is Vohumana.

26:11.700 --> 26:16.700
And Vohumana means the best thinking, the best thinking.

26:16.700 --> 26:24.700
And notice, humana in Vohumana becomes humanitas.

26:24.700 --> 26:28.700
Vohumana, the best thinking, is the means whereby we become truly human.

26:28.700 --> 26:32.700
Unless you cultivate Vohumana, you're not really a human being.

26:32.700 --> 26:35.700
You're an animal that walks on two legs.

26:35.700 --> 26:50.700
Okay, so this notion that became prominent in the Roman Empire of humanitas being something that is not necessarily inherent, shouldn't be taken for granted, but something that has to be cultivated.

26:50.700 --> 27:02.700
And this is a notion that goes back to Zarathustra's concept of Vohumana, one of the seven Amesha Spentas or emanations of Ahura Mazda.

27:02.700 --> 27:06.700
Then we've got Haurava Tath.

27:06.700 --> 27:10.700
And so, okay, there's a certain internal logic to this.

27:10.700 --> 27:19.700
When you cultivate Vohumana or the best thinking, you are aligning yourself with Asha Vahishta, with cosmic order.

27:19.700 --> 27:34.700
And when you align yourself with Asha, with cosmic order through the best thinking, then you also wind up becoming a vehicle or channel for the progressive force in the cosmos.

27:34.700 --> 27:36.700
Namely, sepan taminu.

27:36.700 --> 27:44.700
This progressive mentality starts to become the dominant spirit of your life as you align yourself with cosmic order through the best thinking.

27:44.700 --> 27:48.700
That's how sepan taminu, Asha Vahishta and Vohumana are connected.

27:48.700 --> 28:03.700
And then, when you start to come into this alignment through the cultivation of your human potential for rationality and intellect, then you attain a series of other attributes.

28:03.700 --> 28:08.700
One of them is Haurava Tath, which means wholeness.

28:09.700 --> 28:15.700
Wholeness in the sense that the word health used to mean to be hail or whole.

28:15.700 --> 28:29.700
And this kind of wholeness was symbolized by water in early Zoroastrianism, which I think is where the baptism idea comes from in Christianity.

28:29.700 --> 28:35.700
This baptism, submersion and water as a symbol of conferring wholeness upon a person.

28:35.700 --> 28:49.700
Another attribute that follows from cultivating the best thinking is Ameratot, which is often translated as immortality and people connect this to like the Taoist notion of longevity.

28:49.700 --> 28:54.700
But actually the word Ameratot means deathlessness.

28:55.700 --> 29:05.700
Ameratot, mer, mer is like a cognate of, you know, mocht in French, or you know, it's our word for mortality.

29:05.700 --> 29:14.700
You can see how Ameratot mortality, right? So it's Ameratot, immortality, deathlessness.

29:14.700 --> 29:15.700
Immortal.

29:15.700 --> 29:19.700
Immortal, right? But okay, but it could just mean like vitality.

29:19.700 --> 29:20.700
Right.

29:20.700 --> 29:25.700
Coming from out of the power and grip of death and being very vital.

29:25.700 --> 29:29.700
So vitality and wholeness coming from cultivating the best thinking.

29:29.700 --> 29:35.700
And then this is where you get the idea of apotheosis later on in these Gnostics.

29:35.700 --> 29:37.700
Makes sense.

29:37.700 --> 29:50.700
And then you have spent Armaiti, which is tranquility, serenity, poise, kind of, you know, deep grace and groundedness.

29:50.700 --> 30:04.700
And whereas Ameratot is symbolized by vegetation, spent Armaiti is symbolized by the earth, the element of earth, so grounded serenity and tranquility coming from being well rooted

30:04.700 --> 30:13.700
through, you know, the cultivation of the best thinking and the wholeness or health and vitality that comes from it.

30:13.700 --> 30:22.700
And then finally, Vohul Khashatra is the last of these seven attributes or emanations of Ahura Mazda.

30:22.700 --> 30:31.700
And that means the best dominion or the ideal governance or, you know, the most righteous form of rule.

30:31.700 --> 30:46.700
And so this is another thing which if you, you know, if we can keep it in mind to come back to is important in terms of teasing out the distinctions between Zarathustra teaching and the various forms of Gnosticism that were deeply influenced by it,

30:46.700 --> 30:50.700
because in Gnosticism, you know, we can flesh this out later.

30:50.700 --> 31:00.700
There is this inherent critique of power where all powers are contic and, you know, generally all political regimes are inherently bound for corruption so forth.

31:00.700 --> 31:04.700
Not so in Zarathustra's vision in Zarathustra, Zarathustra is the first utopian.

31:04.700 --> 31:14.700
And he believes that there can be an ideal form of government based on the governance of the wise from which Plato later gets his idea of the philosopher kings and so on and so forth.

31:14.700 --> 31:19.700
These are the seven major attributes of, you know, the teachings of Zarathustra.

31:19.700 --> 31:28.700
But, but, you know, there's other points I want to get to that we find in the gothers as well but just if you want to have any reflections and commentary on that before we continue.

31:28.700 --> 31:31.700
Oh, let's see. So yeah, so.

31:31.700 --> 31:44.700
Okay, so he's spreading these ideas and let's how do we get from that to having like separate different types forms of Gnosticism that spread as far as Greece like how do these ideas get fleshed out.

31:44.700 --> 31:57.700
Yeah, okay, before, okay, so before we head to the influence on, and this is, let me just lay out a few other important points, okay, because they're going to be vital to the impact of Zarathustra's thinking on Gnosticism.

31:57.700 --> 32:08.700
One is that there's a counterforce to, I was about to say to Ahura Mazda, because this is how the Gnostics interpret this counterforce.

32:08.700 --> 32:21.700
And really it's a counterforce to Sepanto Minu, to this, you know, the seventh power or, you know, the main attribute of Ahura Mazda, and that counterforce is called Angra Minu.

32:21.700 --> 32:28.700
So you have Sepanto Minu and Angra Minu, and this Angra Minu is later contracted linguistically to Ahriman.

32:28.700 --> 32:29.700
Right.

32:29.700 --> 32:39.700
Angra Minu literally means the constricted constrained mentality and Gira Gira in Persian means nodded up, like nodded up, like, you know.

32:39.700 --> 32:45.700
And for anyone that wants, anyone doesn't, this influences Christianity big time with the devil.

32:45.700 --> 32:52.700
And there's a passage in Matthew where Jesus is in the wilderness, and he's being tempted by the devil.

32:52.700 --> 33:05.700
And I'm not even kidding, if you look at the Zendavesta, the passage lines up almost verbatim, where it's the same thing you have Zarathustra in the wilderness chanting, doing his thing.

33:05.700 --> 33:11.700
And then all of a sudden, Sepanto Minu comes out and he's like, Hey, if you worship me, I'll give you the boon to rule the all.

33:11.700 --> 33:13.700
Angra Minu, Angra Minu.

33:13.700 --> 33:16.700
Yeah, yeah, he goes, I'll give you the boon to rule all the nations.

33:16.700 --> 33:23.700
And of course, Zarathustra just keeps chanting to Ohora Mazda and Angra Minu is rushed away, pushed off.

33:23.700 --> 33:30.700
This is the story really influences how Jesus is portrayed in Matthew.

33:30.700 --> 33:40.700
And by the way, this just happens to be the same book that starts off with Magi chasing a star for to find like there can't be a coincidence.

33:40.700 --> 33:44.700
This is a highly, I think people think Matthew is a Jewish book.

33:44.700 --> 33:49.700
I mean, I think it's just Eastern book. I guess that makes more sense, right?

33:49.700 --> 33:59.700
There's a lot that could be said about all of that. Yeah, I'll try to come back to it, in particular to the devil. Okay, because the devil's in the details.

33:59.700 --> 34:05.700
Anyway, so, so Angra Minu, right, what is this Angra Minu?

34:05.700 --> 34:27.700
Angra Minu, right, get a constrained constricted. This is the force or counter force that is constraining progress is suffocating life is constricting our flourishing right so it's a force of

34:28.700 --> 34:35.700
stagnation and stasis and retardation, actually. Okay.

34:35.700 --> 34:47.700
And so one important thing about this Angra Minu notion that becomes Arriman in Middle Persian is that it means Ahura Mazda is not omnipotent.

34:47.700 --> 35:00.700
Okay, he's neither omnipotent nor omniscient. And this is really important because many theologians have recognized and on account of this fact Zoroastrianism doesn't face the problem of evil.

35:00.700 --> 35:15.700
In any religion where you have an omniscient and omnipotent God, you know, there's a problem of God being responsible for all the evil in the world. And if in my view, more importantly, you know, the fact that you don't have any free will you cannot have free will and have an omnipotent and omniscient God it doesn't work.

35:15.700 --> 35:23.700
Okay, it's completely illogical. And any jackass like St. Augustine who wants to say that it's a miracle. I'm not going to give him the time of day. All right.

35:23.700 --> 35:31.700
So you got to choose between your omniscient God omnipotent God on the one hand and free will on the others. Arathustra doesn't face that problem.

35:31.700 --> 35:48.700
Aura Mazda is limited, the power and even the, you know, knowledge of Aura Mazda is limited by this counter force. And this means we have free will we have the free will radically to choose between these two forces and which one we want to align ourselves with.

35:48.700 --> 35:55.700
And that's a message you find at the core of the dafas that Arathustra repeatedly says and emphatically so.

35:55.700 --> 35:59.700
You with your own intellect.

35:59.700 --> 36:14.700
Observe discern and choose which of the forces you want to align yourself with, either sepantaminu or angraminu. And to go back to the beginning of our discussion, the devas are aligned with Angraminu.

36:14.700 --> 36:25.700
Okay. So, and he specifically says this in the gaffas, there is this very strange passage in the gaffas, which if you ask me aligns with the myth of Atlantis that you find in Plato.

36:25.700 --> 36:34.700
And, you know, with some things in the in the Vedic context in terms of the Mahabharata's accounts of the ancient wars between the devas and the ashura's and so forth.

36:34.700 --> 36:49.700
And there's a strange passage in the gaffas where as Arathustra says that when the devas were deliberating Angraminu came in, and he as a great deceiver confused their deliberations and they rushed in wrath and destroyed the life of mankind.

36:49.700 --> 36:58.700
Well, what is this talking about this is talking about when Zeus calls a convocation of the Olympians and they decide to destroy the world through a great, great deluge.

36:58.700 --> 37:05.700
And in particular, they're targeting the Atlanteans who have rebelled against Olympus.

37:05.700 --> 37:09.700
So the devas, the gods are aligned with Angraminu or Ahrema.

37:09.700 --> 37:20.700
And we have the free choice to be able to basically resist these heavenly powers that notice now the Gnostic structure is already becoming clear.

37:20.700 --> 37:26.700
These heavenly powers that stand between us and the true divine intelligence of the cosmos.

37:27.700 --> 37:28.700
Archons.

37:28.700 --> 37:29.700
Yeah.

37:29.700 --> 37:30.700
Yeah.

37:30.700 --> 37:32.700
So the devas are the Archons.

37:32.700 --> 37:33.700
Wow.

37:33.700 --> 37:35.700
Zarathustra's take on the devas or devs.

37:35.700 --> 37:39.700
It's where we get the word devil from devs, right?

37:39.700 --> 37:44.700
The devas, they are the Archons.

37:44.700 --> 37:53.700
They're the prototype for the Gnostic Archons who stand between us and our alignment with the divine intelligence, you know, in the cosmos.

37:53.700 --> 37:55.700
Wow.

37:56.700 --> 38:03.700
The more you talk about it, the more it's starting to look a lot clearer of how these ideas line up.

38:03.700 --> 38:09.700
One last very important piece of the message of the Gapas that's going to become fundamental to Gnosticism.

38:09.700 --> 38:13.700
And that's the idea that, well, two more.

38:13.700 --> 38:24.700
One is that this choice, this free choice that we have has to be exercised within a certain timeframe.

38:24.700 --> 38:30.700
Zarathustra is the first person in recorded history to have a teleological conception of time.

38:30.700 --> 38:36.700
So all of these ancient cultures, the Greek culture, the Vedic culture, the Mayan culture, I mean ancient Egyptian, etc.

38:36.700 --> 38:47.700
Everywhere across the entire globe, you had cyclical conceptions of time where there were a series of world ages that you'd go through from the Golden Age, the Silver Age, the Bronze Age, etc.

38:48.700 --> 38:55.700
Iron Age, or the Greek, you know, Satya Yuga, all the way to the Kali Yuga, and then the cycle would repeat itself, right?

38:55.700 --> 38:58.700
Zarathustra says no.

38:58.700 --> 39:12.700
There is a successive series of world ages that are in a progressive trajectory toward an end of history that's an apocalypse.

39:12.700 --> 39:16.700
And this end of history is a final judgment.

39:16.700 --> 39:29.700
The forces of wisdom and the forces of ignorance and retardation between the forward momentum of creation and regression retardation and basically the power of death.

39:29.700 --> 39:34.700
And so we have to make our choice before this final event.

39:34.700 --> 39:40.700
And this final event is symbolized by the entire globe being engulfed in flame.

39:40.700 --> 39:45.700
Okay, the world being set ablaze, which is an alchemical metaphor.

39:45.700 --> 39:51.700
Right, it's the alchemical fire transmuting this world into a more perfect form.

39:51.700 --> 39:53.700
And they call this the Fresh Guard.

39:53.700 --> 39:58.700
And, well, this is what Zarathustra calls it in the Gaphas in its original form.

39:58.700 --> 40:02.700
Fresh O'Keretti and it becomes Fresh Guard in Middle Persian.

40:02.700 --> 40:08.700
Literally, if you can hear the word fresh in that Fresh Guard, Fresh O'Keretti, fresh.

40:08.700 --> 40:13.700
So it's the refreshing of the world. It's like hitting the refresh button on a browser, right?

40:13.700 --> 40:15.700
It's the refreshing of the world.

40:15.700 --> 40:19.700
And it's accomplished through this alchemical fire.

40:19.700 --> 40:25.700
And on the other side of that, everything attains its perfect form.

40:25.700 --> 40:31.700
So this brings us then to the last idea, which is key to Gnosticism.

40:31.700 --> 40:43.700
And that's that we have, there are these Farvahas or Fravashis that are the perfect forms of everything in the world.

40:43.700 --> 40:46.700
And they pre-exist the created world.

40:46.700 --> 40:49.700
No, no, no, notice, we're like 200 years before Plato here.

40:49.700 --> 40:50.700
Okay.

40:50.700 --> 40:58.700
So this idea that as I'm going to point to, if we have the time, Plato gets via Pythagoras from Zarathustra.

40:58.700 --> 41:11.700
This idea of the archetypes pre-existing physical creation on the basis of them is also central to the message of Zarathustra.

41:11.700 --> 41:27.700
And it becomes key to Gnosticism. This is the notion of the Pluroma or the, you know, some aetheric, whatever, non-physical realm where there are more perfect forms of beings in this world.

41:27.700 --> 41:34.700
So the Pluroma notion in its, in its, you know, embryonic form is there in the Gaphas of Zarathustra.

41:34.700 --> 41:49.700
And there's an idea that after the Fraschgaard, after this fiery, you know, apocalypse, this world, this physical world is going to more perfectly instantiate or embody this archetypal reality.

41:49.700 --> 41:54.700
And in particular, in terms of our human existence,

41:54.700 --> 42:01.700
each person who passes that trial by fire will embody his Dana.

42:01.700 --> 42:09.700
Dana is a word that Zarathustra uses, which is a cognate of the Greek dianoia.

42:09.700 --> 42:14.700
And it becomes the basis for two words in later Persian.

42:15.700 --> 42:22.700
Dana, which means knowing, and Dane, which means duty. So think knowing and duty.

42:22.700 --> 42:26.700
So the word Dana meant conscience in the teaching of Zarathustra.

42:26.700 --> 42:31.700
And it was symbolized by a maiden who you would meet after death.

42:31.700 --> 42:39.700
And this maiden, like a Valkyrie, right? This maiden was your perfect form, your, your anima, you know.

42:39.700 --> 42:42.700
Is this where Diana comes from? The goddess?

42:42.700 --> 42:45.700
I think so. And I'll tell you why in a moment.

42:45.700 --> 42:50.700
Well, I'll tell you why, why right now. Okay, because who is Diana? Diana is the Roman form of Artemis.

42:50.700 --> 43:00.700
Artemis has no meaning in Greek. We know, you know, Herodotus and other Greek writers say that the cult of Artemis was the religion of the Amazons.

43:00.700 --> 43:06.700
And they're the ones who brought it to Greece. The Amazons built the temple of Artemis. The Amazons are Iranians.

43:06.700 --> 43:12.700
The Amazons are Sarmatians. They're Sarmatian women. And they had a matriarchal society.

43:12.700 --> 43:17.700
And so we have to look for the meaning of Artemis in Iranian languages, not in Greek.

43:17.700 --> 43:22.700
And Artemis has a very clear meaning in Iranian languages. It's Arta, Amesha.

43:22.700 --> 43:34.700
As I mentioned earlier, Arta is a Persian form of Asha, cosmic order, or truth. Truth is another translation of Asha or Arta.

43:34.700 --> 43:46.700
And then Amesha, like I can remember, the Amesha spentas. The Amesha spentas, the seven emanations of Zaratus, of Armasda.

43:46.700 --> 43:57.700
Amesha means undying or immortal. And Spenta is the sort of like the spirits, right? The immortal spirits.

43:57.700 --> 44:08.700
So Arta, Amesha, Artemis. Arta, Amesha means immortal truth or immortal cosmic order.

44:08.700 --> 44:18.700
And this is who Artemis really is. She's an embodiment of immortal cosmic order in a feminine form coming from out of a matriarchal Iranian society.

44:18.700 --> 44:24.700
So do I think Diana is related to Dana? Yeah, I do think it's, you know, via Artemis.

44:24.700 --> 44:30.700
Oh, true, yeah. I think you just laid it out perfectly. I don't think you can even deny it.

44:30.700 --> 44:40.700
The chief attribute of, I don't know, attribute is not necessarily the right word, but look, she's known as a huntress who's associated with archery in particular.

44:40.700 --> 44:42.700
The oldest myth in the world is the wild hunt.

44:42.700 --> 44:46.700
The Iranians were known as the greatest archers of the ancient world.

44:46.700 --> 44:54.700
Matata says the Iranians taught their kids three things. One, telling the truth to horseback riding in three archery.

44:54.700 --> 44:59.700
Right. Okay, speak the truth and shoot well with arrows. That is Persian virtue, quote unquote.

44:59.700 --> 45:13.700
And even Alexander the Great, if you read Arian, when he, when, before he even went to Persia in the East, he, he battled with the Skithians and he recruited thousands of their archers to even go to Persia.

45:13.700 --> 45:16.700
And he probably couldn't even do that unless he did that first.

45:16.700 --> 45:22.700
Yeah, they were the greatest ballistics people in the ancient world, the Iranians in general, Skithians and Persians both.

45:22.700 --> 45:23.700
Yeah.

45:23.700 --> 45:30.700
So, so anyway, yes, so you got this Dana. She's like this Valkyrie, who's your most perfect form.

45:30.700 --> 45:36.700
And after, and also her word, her name becomes the word for knowledge in Persian later, Donna.

45:36.700 --> 45:39.700
And so this is Sophia. It's your inner Sophia.

45:39.700 --> 45:40.700
Wow.

45:40.700 --> 45:46.700
Okay, and you're supposed to become her after the end of history, after the apocalypse.

45:46.700 --> 46:04.700
We become, which is kind of bizarre because this is like some, it's very strange, it's an uber matriarchal conception, because it's saying that both men and women have this inner feminine, perfect form and that after the end of the world, like we're all going to embody that.

46:04.700 --> 46:05.700
Yeah.

46:05.700 --> 46:15.700
The old story too, Proverbs, Proverbs eight where it talks about Sophia first formed father totally switches that everything on his head like Adam is created by a female now like which one is it.

46:15.700 --> 46:29.700
But I think that's how you get these middle or these medieval cobalists that that's what they're interpreting later on. But anyway, that's a whole different story. But yeah, I'm basically saying this is reflective in other parts of theology and philosophy.

46:29.700 --> 46:43.700
Yeah, and and it's the it's the last what becomes the Gnostic destruction of the fallen world, and the emergence of the pluroma as our primary form of existence, and our embodying Sophia at the end of history.

46:43.700 --> 46:49.700
It's all right there already in the gathas and you know, 580 BC.

46:49.700 --> 47:04.700
Okay, so that lays out for us that the basic message of the gathas and now we can finally address this question that you raised, or maybe you want to raise in you about the influence of Zarathustra or Zoroaster on and by the way let me just mention this guy's name like what

47:04.700 --> 47:08.700
is this, why some people call him Zoroaster.

47:08.700 --> 47:15.700
Why is he called Zarathustra in. Yeah, that's a good question.

47:15.700 --> 47:33.700
I assume the Greeks came up with this Zoroaster as a corruption of Zarathustra, because Zoroaster means Zara, or Zara in Persian means gold, and Aster, of course, is the word for star.

47:33.700 --> 47:50.700
Zarathustra still means star in Persian. And so Zoroaster means golden star, but this is probably a corruption, because Zarathustra calls himself Zarathustra in the gathas and you know that's the Holy Iranian tradition refers to him is that

47:50.700 --> 48:06.700
when Iranology becomes sophisticated in Europe in the 1800s, 1700s, 1800s, you know, you have the correct name Zarathustra reemerge and that's why Nietzsche uses the correct name of Zarathustra rather than Zoroaster, and Zarathustra means

48:06.700 --> 48:25.700
golden star, but golden camel, ushtara is camel, later becomes the word ushtara, or ushtara in Persian means camel, so his name meant golden camel, and back in that time when he was alive, the two most prized animals were horses and

48:25.700 --> 48:41.700
animals, and you found a lot of people with an ending name ending aspa, like Zarathustra's own friend Jam aspa, the king that became his patron, Visht aspa, aspa means horse, and ushtara means camel, so you had people named so and so camel or so and so horse.

48:41.700 --> 48:43.700
And so his name means golden camel.

48:43.700 --> 48:53.700
That's interesting, because I'm learning Greek right now, and my Greek teacher was just telling me that every time you see the str in a word, this comes from a family.

48:53.700 --> 49:01.700
It's a certain family of linguistic words that have like a root somewhere, and it's like real deep in mythology, I guess.

49:01.700 --> 49:12.700
But also as far as the camels go, you could see why camels would be so valuable because you can put tons of items on their back and travel long distances without having to carry it.

49:12.700 --> 49:14.700
Like traders needed camels.

49:14.700 --> 49:20.700
That's right. That's right. And of course, in this case, we're talking not about because your viewers are going to think Iran, whatever, Middle East.

49:20.700 --> 49:24.700
No, we're not talking about Arabian camels here. We're talking about the Central Asian camel.

49:24.700 --> 49:25.700
Right.

49:25.700 --> 49:31.700
Zarathustra was living up towards Central Asia. So we're talking about the Central Asian camel. In any case, that's irrelevant.

49:31.700 --> 49:36.700
So the influence of Zarathustra.

49:36.700 --> 49:40.700
So Pythagoras, okay.

49:40.700 --> 49:43.700
Look, Pythagoras is the first philosopher.

49:43.700 --> 49:45.700
He's like the Abraham of the Greeks.

49:45.700 --> 49:50.700
Well, God's forbid, God's forbid that we should ever compare him to Abraham.

49:50.700 --> 49:54.700
Look, this is even from a Gnostic perspective, utter heresy, right?

49:54.700 --> 49:55.700
Okay.

49:55.700 --> 50:02.700
Abraham was a child murdering, you know, mindless zombie listening to a psychopathic voice from heaven.

50:02.700 --> 50:06.700
And Pythagoras was a torchbearer of wisdom and enlightenment for humanity.

50:06.700 --> 50:11.700
But I take your point, meaning like he's the forerunner of the entire

50:11.700 --> 50:13.700
tradition in Greece.

50:13.700 --> 50:20.700
Because nobody used the word philosophy before Pythagoras or the word philosopher, he's the one who coins the term.

50:20.700 --> 50:29.700
And where is the word philosopher or philosophy didn't exist in Greek, it did in ancient Iranian.

50:29.700 --> 50:33.700
Zarathustra wasn't a Zoroastrian.

50:33.700 --> 50:36.700
And he didn't call his doctrine Zoroastrianism.

50:36.700 --> 50:41.700
He called it Mazda Yasna, which means reverence for wisdom.

50:41.700 --> 50:45.700
And a person following it was a Mazda Yasna, a reverer of wisdom.

50:45.700 --> 50:52.700
And in particular, in the teaching of Zarathustra, you do not worship Ahura Mazda.

50:52.700 --> 50:55.700
You are a friend of Ahura Mazda.

50:55.700 --> 50:57.700
That's the term that he uses.

50:57.700 --> 51:06.700
He used to be a friend of Ahura Mazda and the relationship to the wisdom, the Titanic wisdom is a relationship of friendship.

51:06.700 --> 51:12.700
So philo Sophia philia means friendship in Greek and Sophia means wisdom.

51:12.700 --> 51:21.700
So Pythagoras is just translating Mazda Yasna into Greek when he coins the term philosophy or the term philosopher.

51:21.700 --> 51:29.700
And we know this is the case because the man spent a decade, more than a decade in the capital of the Persian Empire.

51:29.700 --> 51:32.700
When Pythagoras was young, he went to Egypt.

51:32.700 --> 51:42.700
And while he was in Egypt, studying with the priests and measuring the pyramid measure measuring the inside of the king's chamber to get the Pythagorean theorem and so on and so forth.

51:42.700 --> 51:49.700
He was arrested by the military forces of Cambyses II.

51:49.700 --> 51:51.700
Cambyses II was the son of Cyrus the Great.

51:51.700 --> 51:54.700
He was the second emperor of the Persian Empire.

51:54.700 --> 52:06.700
And as a joke, he had Pythagoras arrested the way that in Plato's Republic, there's the scene at the beginning where Socrates is arrested by his friends.

52:06.700 --> 52:10.700
In other words, they forced him to come and have a philosophical discussion.

52:10.700 --> 52:14.700
They're like, we're not going to let you go, man, you're going to come and you're going to talk to us.

52:14.700 --> 52:17.700
We're going to get some, we're going to pick your brains and get some wisdom out of your head.

52:17.700 --> 52:18.700
Like what I'm doing with you right now.

52:18.700 --> 52:21.700
Well, maybe in any case.

52:21.700 --> 52:26.700
So they grabbed this guy and they say that, listen, the king really wants to talk to you.

52:26.700 --> 52:32.700
Please come back with us, whether you want it or not, you're coming back with us to Babylon, to the capital of the Persian Empire.

52:32.700 --> 52:38.700
And, you know, we want you to sit with the magi and the king and, you know, talk to us.

52:38.700 --> 52:45.700
And so he goes back with them and he spends 10 to 12 years.

52:45.700 --> 52:46.700
That's what I've heard.

52:46.700 --> 52:47.700
Yeah.

52:47.700 --> 52:57.700
Over a decade studying with, and I think probably to some extent it was, you know, you know, two-way relationship, working with the magi.

52:57.700 --> 53:02.700
Okay, the Zoroastrian priests in the capital of the Persian Empire, a dozen years.

53:02.700 --> 53:12.700
Now, I'm not sure if you know about this, but among the stuff that's found from Marcus Aurelius in his writings, he's got Greek translations of Zoroaster.

53:12.700 --> 53:17.700
And I'm wondering if this is, maybe through Pythagoras somehow it gets passed down.

53:17.700 --> 53:18.700
Yeah.

53:18.700 --> 53:19.700
Yeah.

53:19.700 --> 53:27.700
I'm sure these writings were common both in the Pythagorean schools and also in the Platonic Academy, ultimately.

53:27.700 --> 53:37.700
And the reason they didn't get to us is because of the burning of the library of Alexandria and Corinth and various other places, you know, where these libraries were torched.

53:37.700 --> 53:44.700
So, so look, and by the way, let me just, this is not a side note.

53:44.700 --> 53:46.700
This is actually really relevant.

53:46.700 --> 54:01.700
One way we know that's true, and I'm just not making some anti-Christian claim like, you know, off the top of my head or what are pulling it out of somewhere is because we know there was this guy and a carcass of Scythia, who was another one living around

54:01.700 --> 54:06.700
the time of Zarathustra between Zarathustra and Pythagoras.

54:06.700 --> 54:18.700
And he was a Scythian by paternal descent, whose mother was Greek, and he went from Scythia, in other words, from Northern Iran to Athens, where he became friends with Solon.

54:18.700 --> 54:29.700
And he was also known as one of the most, in fact, besides Zarathustra, and a carcass is the first pre-Socratic philosopher.

54:29.700 --> 54:33.700
And he had a notorious reputation, this guy did.

54:33.700 --> 54:42.700
He was basically a philosophical anarchist, and we can come back to this, you know, a lot of what becomes the teaching of Gautama Buddha, I think is deeply influenced by Anacarsus of Scythia.

54:42.700 --> 55:01.700
A lot of what becomes Taoism, deeply influenced by Anacarsus of Scythia's deconstruction of polar opposites and his critique of emergent rationality, and his own notion of basically, you know, nature as a flux and the dynamic interplay of opposites,

55:01.700 --> 55:10.700
and the lack of any objective criteria for making judgments about things. He was like a proto-Synic in a lot of ways.

55:10.700 --> 55:11.700
Wow.

55:11.700 --> 55:21.700
And, okay, and he was Iranian. All right, he's coming from the same cultural milieu as Zarathustra. But here's the thing. There are no writings of his that have survived.

55:21.700 --> 55:27.700
This guy wrote a shit ton. People quoted him in various books, and we don't have anything from Anacarsus of Scythia.

55:27.700 --> 55:29.700
So therefore, go ahead.

55:29.700 --> 55:31.700
Is that what he met Solon, the lawgiver?

55:31.700 --> 55:39.700
He was friends with him. He was personal friends with him. Solon said, he came and he said to Solon, hey, you know, I came here to be your friend.

55:39.700 --> 55:45.700
You know, I think we could really, you know, have a profitable relationship. Solon said to him, you know, it's best to make friends at home.

55:45.700 --> 55:52.700
I mean, get lost, man. You're some foreigner, you know, get the hell out of here. And he said, well, you know, since you're at home, you should make friends with me.

55:52.700 --> 55:55.700
And anyway, the two of them struck up. Yeah, in Athens, yeah.

55:55.700 --> 55:56.700
Okay, okay.

55:56.700 --> 55:58.700
He moved to Athens. He was an Iranian who moved to Athens.

55:58.700 --> 56:04.700
Because there is a story that Solon goes to Heliopolis, because that was where the Great Library was before Alexandria.

56:04.700 --> 56:05.700
Yeah.

56:05.700 --> 56:06.700
And so this is after that?

56:06.700 --> 56:12.700
I'm not sure when in Solon's life it was, whether it was before he went to Egypt or after he went to Egypt or at what point.

56:12.700 --> 56:14.700
But that's still fascinating that he has it.

56:14.700 --> 56:26.700
Well, actually, I can tell you, it was in 589 BC. So people familiar with the life of Solon, they can figure out whether it was before or after he went to Egypt.

56:26.700 --> 56:27.700
Leave it in the comments.

56:27.700 --> 56:28.700
There you go.

56:28.700 --> 56:29.700
Yeah.

56:29.700 --> 56:42.700
But just notice the date here. Anacarsis came to Athens in 589 BC. When was the likely date that Zarathustra composed the Gathas? 580 BC. So this is within nine years.

56:42.700 --> 56:44.700
Wow, so now we can start pinpointing when things happen now.

56:44.700 --> 56:45.700
Exactly.

56:45.700 --> 56:54.700
So this is, you know, it makes a lot of sense Zarathustra would have been at this time, and would have been a major catalytic force for the rise of pre-Socratic philosophy.

56:54.700 --> 57:09.700
In any case, why did I bring up Anacarsis? Yeah, it's obvious we lost a lot of these writings and that there were definitely texts by Zarathustra other than the Gathas and other, I hesitate to call them Zoroastrian texts, texts of Mazda,

57:09.700 --> 57:19.700
Yassna, Iranian wisdom, translated into Greek, which were in these libraries and which we lost through the catastrophic rise of the Catholic Church and so forth.

57:19.700 --> 57:22.700
But in any case, okay, we got sidetracked, Pythagoras.

57:22.700 --> 57:23.700
Yeah.

57:24.700 --> 57:32.700
So he studies for a dozen years in the capital of the Persian Empire with the Magi, the priests who have adopted the doctrine of Zarathustra.

57:32.700 --> 57:38.700
So obviously this guy, he's got to have been under massive influence from the teaching of Zarathustra.

57:38.700 --> 57:42.700
And you can see it reflected in Pythagoras' teaching.

57:43.700 --> 57:51.700
He has this notion of Peras and Aperon, that there are these two principles that work in the cosmos. One is a principle of order.

57:51.700 --> 57:55.700
This is what, you know, when he says everything is number, right?

57:55.700 --> 58:02.700
Pythagoras is saying there is this principle of limit and limitation and demarcation, Peras.

58:02.700 --> 58:10.700
And what it is demarcating and limiting is Aperon, a chaotic unlimited, okay, and this chaotic unlimited is like a,

58:10.700 --> 58:16.700
it's like a vortex, it's like a black hole, like, you know, the event horizon of a black hole tears everything apart, right?

58:16.700 --> 58:21.700
So this is like Angaraminu, this is like the force of chaos and disorder.

58:21.700 --> 58:26.700
So you see this at the heart of the ontology of Pythagoras.

58:26.700 --> 58:35.700
You also see that Pythagoras, and I neglected to mention this earlier in terms of Zarathustra, but I'm coming back to it now.

58:35.700 --> 58:49.700
Pythagoras has a exceptional respect for women and a, you know, a promotion of the bizarre notion at the time of radically countercultural notion that women should have a quality of opportunity.

58:49.700 --> 58:56.700
He took women as students into the Pythagorean school and some of them rose to be teachers in the Pythagorean order.

58:56.700 --> 59:00.700
And this is something you find in the Gathas of Zarathustra as well.

59:00.700 --> 59:11.700
Zarathustra, I mean, this is unheard. In 600 BC, this guy is talking about the equality of women and how women have conscience and rationality and should make their own choices in life.

59:11.700 --> 59:18.700
And he officiates at his daughter's wedding and like gives this whole sermon about how her life is her own and she should make her own choices and so on and so forth.

59:18.700 --> 59:23.700
This could possibly be from this Dana idea from Zarathustra.

59:23.700 --> 59:26.700
Yeah, and let's not forget.

59:26.700 --> 59:38.700
A whole third of the Iranian community and those are a fourth of the Iranian community in those days, the Sarmatians, were in matriarchal society who became the basis for the Amazon myths among the Greeks.

59:38.700 --> 59:41.700
That's a really good point. This is all coming together now.

59:41.700 --> 59:47.700
And plus the Greeks used to say about the Persians, that the Persians were.

59:47.700 --> 01:00:00.700
They used to say there were pansies and cucks who were like under the thumb of their women. And they're you know at the Persian court and the you know women called all the shots and so on so forth and

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:09.700
because the Greeks were extremely patriarchal, you know paternalistic people, but yeah in the ancient Persian military you had female admirals in the Persian Navy.

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:11.700
Okay, so.

01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:18.700
All right, so Pythagoras is also getting this from the teaching of Zarathustra the place that women have in the Pythagorean order.

01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:35.700
And his notions of justice and of how governments should be run are clearly based on Zarathustra's idea of the best governance or the most righteous form of regime, which is the rule of philosophers.

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:46.700
Okay, the, the system that he was setting up in real life with Kavi Vishtaspa his patron where basically he was a court philosopher determining court policy.

01:00:46.700 --> 01:01:02.700
And so this is an idea that Pythagoras is getting from Zarathustra and that then Plato as a member of the Pythagorean order adopts and articulates in Republic as I was about to say philosopher kingship but really it should be called

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:08.700
philosopher guardianship because women can be philosopher rulers as well.

01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:27.700
So, you find all these ideas, you know, in the teachings of Pythagoras that are and then of course you know, when we talk about archetypes right, as I mentioned earlier, the whole notion of archetypes that you find at the core of platonic ontology comes from the Pythagorean order.

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:32.700
Plato is getting that through his membership in this secret society.

01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:40.700
And Pythagoras is getting that from Zarathustra via the magi that he's studying with for a dozen years in the capital of the Persian Empire.

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:53.700
Now it's also noteworthy that Pythagoras only leaves Iran and goes and let's remember okay Babylon. Okay, it's in Iraq today. Iraq is a fake country.

01:01:53.700 --> 01:02:06.700
It was created by the British colonialists. It's a fake country. The capital of Iran was in Iraq for for Iranian empires, the capital, not only was Iraq part of Iran.

01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:18.700
It was the capital district okay so this Mesopotamia has spent the better part of the past 2500 years as part of Iran integral part of Iran.

01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:34.700
It was the period where the Ottoman Turks overran it and ruled it for a while before the British carved Iraq anyway, point being that he only leaves Iran Pythagoras does when the Persian Empire conquers his native island of Samos.

01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:35.700
Right.

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:38.700
And he goes to Italy and sets up in proton Italy.

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:52.700
So how come how come Pythagoras only leaves Iran when Iran conquers Samos. If you are some nationalist Greek, right, you would hate the Persians for conquering your homeland.

01:02:52.700 --> 01:03:00.700
No, this guy only leaves Iran and goes back to his homeland once it's under Iranian rule. Okay, so he's clearly aligned.

01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:07.700
Right. And then he got and we're going to talk about her Heraclitus to and, you know, his politics and how that was aligned with the Persian Empire.

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:17.700
But he goes from Samos as you mentioned to Italy and he sets up the Pythagorean schools in southern Italy. Well, if you ask me what this looks like is he was sent on a mission.

01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:28.700
The major I sent him I said, okay, go now. He was an evangelist basically go now and preach this doctrine in the West, spread this wisdom in the West.

01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:39.700
And he sets up these schools in Italy, which then are burned down by the local, you know, feudal aristocracy because these guys don't want their women in school.

01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:47.700
They don't want, you know, their women becoming a, you know, uppity and talking back and not being good housewives who can, you know, be in the kitchen and so on and so on and so forth.

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:50.700
Yeah, they were like a warrior, warrior cults back over there.

01:03:50.700 --> 01:04:03.700
Yeah, the Pythagoras tried to basically seize control of the government of southern Italy. He had basically all these politicians he was training to carry out a coup d'etat and create a philosopher kingship in southern Italy.

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:13.700
And the local landed aristocracy became wise to this, and they burned down the Pythagorean schools but of course the school spread. And then we had important initiates of the schools.

01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:24.700
Most notably Plato. And so then this Zoroastrian influence gets passed on to play. Okay, so but Pythagoras is is an important figure here because why.

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:35.700
Who were the two people besides Jesus that the Carpacrations set up statues of play Pythagoras and Heraclitus.

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:39.700
Oh, I'm sorry Plato Pythagoras and Plato.

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:53.700
Who were the two major influences on Plato Pythagoras. So people think okay of Socrates when they think of Plato. All right, but I'm going to make a very long story short Socrates was a war veteran, who was a bum on the streets.

01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:58.700
Socrates was like a Vietnam war vet bum.

01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:07.700
Who was a real wise ass. That's the kind of person he was. Plato takes him and he turns him to this grand dramatic persona.

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:21.700
After the death of Socrates. So it's true that Socrates was important like for Plato when Plato was a teenager or very young man in his early 20s and whatever. He was an early mentor to him, but he was like a bum on the street who was

01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:28.700
he also teaches people like Diogenes and you get the cynics that come out of him to exactly that's the type he is. Yeah.

01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:33.700
But Socrates wasn't an important influence on Plato in terms of his thinking.

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:42.700
The doctrines that Plato puts in the mouth of Socrates are influenced by two figures in particular one is Pythagoras, because Plato went on to join the Pythagorean order.

01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:58.700
After that he was a sworn brother of the order, which this could be a whole other program type about you know, the Illuminati in the beginning of the Illuminati and you know, who Plato really was and how much he left unsaid in his writings and so on and so forth his esoteric doctrine.

01:05:58.700 --> 01:05:59.700
That's the next one.

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:05.700
The the other thing, the other major influence on Plato was Heraclitus. Right.

01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:16.700
Aristotle tells us that in the period after the death of Socrates, and before Plato joined the Pythagorean order. Why are we going through all this because of the Carpacritians.

01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:21.700
And they worship Plato together with Pythagoras and Jesus.

01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:33.700
So Aristotle tells us that in that period after the death of Socrates and before Plato becomes a sworn member of the Pythagorean order, Plato studied under this Heraclitian teacher,

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:39.700
and Plato was a zealous Heraclitian.

01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:43.700
He had completely internalized the worldview of Heraclitus.

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:54.700
And Aristotle says it's only on the basis of the Heraclitian worldview that Plato then builds up this ontology of an epistemology of forms.

01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:58.700
The concepts, the Eidos and so on and so forth.

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:12.700
But the backdrop for Plato's sophisticated ontology and epistemology of forms is an acceptance of Heraclitus's view of the world as flux and various other notions of Heraclitus about the nature of cosmic justice and so forth.

01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:17.700
So who are the two main influences on Plato, Heraclitus and Pythagoras.

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:21.700
Okay, we talked about Pythagoras's connection to Iran and Tzarathustra.

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.700
You demonstrated that.

01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:26.700
Well, let's let's talk about Heraclitus.

01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:31.700
A lot of people bring this up that Heraclitus is very Zoroastrian in his thinking.

01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:34.700
So let's go through this.

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:41.700
Heraclitus has a number of ideas in his, we call it fragments.

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:45.700
It was a book that was called On Nature, and now only fragments are left.

01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:53.700
There's a number of ideas in that text that have no precedent in Greek culture, but align directly with Zarathustra's teaching.

01:07:53.700 --> 01:08:05.700
He criticizes all the Greeks, and they're like, he's very much like a Tupac of his day, like criticizing everyone else, but like, yeah, being like a sort of like going against the grain.

01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:07.700
Look, he attacks Homer and he's...

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:09.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:14.700
I mean, this would be the equivalent of being a Satanist in that time.

01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:17.700
You're attacking, you're ripping the Bible to pieces.

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:22.700
Homer and Hesiod were the Bible of that time, and he's just trashing them.

01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:23.700
Right.

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:26.700
Okay, and so, yeah.

01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:28.700
Now, why is he trashing them?

01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:38.700
Because very much in alignment with Zarathustra, Heraclitus is saying that these gods that these guys write about Homer and Hesiod, these Olympians,

01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:40.700
these are not the true divinities.

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:44.700
The true divinity is a divine mind, okay?

01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:55.700
It's a divine mind that expresses itself as cosmic order and that is best symbolized by an undying and ever-changing fire.

01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:59.700
Smentaminu and Ashal Vahishta.

01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:09.700
Okay, Smentaminu is the cosmic order and Ashal Vahishta is its being symbol, best symbolized by fire or energy ever-changing in its forms.

01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:20.700
And another idea that you find there is that everything in nature advances, proceeds, unfolds according to dialectical opposition.

01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:32.700
There is a struggle between dialectically opposed forces, forces that they are in tension with one another and their dynamic tension is creative or constructive.

01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:34.700
And it's what moves the world forward.

01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:43.700
Well, this is also at the core of the teaching of Zarathustra in that, and this is a very subtle and important point.

01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:46.700
Angraminu is also necessary.

01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:48.700
You don't want to get rid of Angraminu.

01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:51.700
Angraminu or Ahriman is also necessary.

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:56.700
It's the struggle between Sementaminu and Angraminu that makes the world work.

01:09:56.700 --> 01:10:03.700
It's like when a forest burns down, it comes back even greater and there's more life after that, sort of.

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.700
Yes, and it's also like a chess game.

01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:06.700
Yeah.

01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:11.700
Angraminu or the black pieces on the board.

01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:16.700
And so the divine mind of Ahurama is the once an opponent.

01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:17.700
Right.

01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:22.700
And notice the ethos behind this mentality, right?

01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:32.700
It's a very chivalric, noble-minded ethos which says, I want evil to go ahead and do its best.

01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:34.700
I want an opponent.

01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:40.700
It's the Olympics ethos of agonistic struggle that we find in the Greek Olympics.

01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:44.700
You have to have that contrast to make that move.

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:47.700
And also, it's not just the contrast, it's what makes you your best.

01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:49.700
You play your best game against the strong opponent.

01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:51.700
Exactly.

01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:55.700
But it takes a certain depth of soul to have that kind of ethos, right?

01:10:55.700 --> 01:11:00.700
I mean, really niggardly, petty people want to just eliminate all opposition.

01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:12.700
The strong and noble-minded person, a free spirit, wants to face the best opposition so that they can become the best version of themselves and find out what they're really capable of.

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:19.700
And so this is also a notion of Zarathustra that winds up at the heart of the teaching of Heraclitus.

01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:28.700
And then there are these peculiar things in there that there's nowhere they could have come from, but from Zarathustra and Iranian culture.

01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:40.700
Like, Heraclitus says, don't keep corpses around and engage in ceremonial rights around corpses.

01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:45.700
He says, throw them out like dumb. Throw corpses out quicker than crap.

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:47.700
Literally, is what he puts in his thick.

01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:49.700
That's literally what's written in Zen Vesta.

01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:50.700
Exactly.

01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:55.700
You can rip your nails off and throw that on the ground. That's got to be disposed in a certain way.

01:11:55.700 --> 01:12:07.700
Zarastrians would take corpses immediately to the outskirts of the city, and they would put them on these rocky outcrops for vultures to descend on the corpses and basically to feed nature.

01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:11.700
Because you don't need your body anymore at that point. Your spirit is gone on.

01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:16.700
So they just take the corpses and they strip them down to the bone in these places and let vultures feed on them.

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:21.700
In any case, they throw them out from the populated area and Heraclitus says this in the fragments.

01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:25.700
Well, this is totally anathema to traditional Greek funerary rights.

01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:28.700
And there's only one place he could have gotten it from.

01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:36.700
And then when we look at his politics, okay, it's just, it's just absolutely undeniably obvious.

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:39.700
And then we look at Heraclitus's politics.

01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:43.700
He is vehemently opposed to democracy.

01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:54.700
He believes that the wise should rule, and that the best men, meaning the ones with the most cultivated intellect should be the guardians of a society.

01:12:54.700 --> 01:13:04.700
And so committed to this idea that when his personal friend, Hermodorus, the satrap, the Persian governor of Ephesus.

01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:11.700
Okay, so Heraclitus's buddy was the Persian governor of Ephesus, a guy called Hermodorus.

01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:23.700
And when this guy is overthrown in an Ephesian revolt against Persian rule, Heraclitus says of his fellow citizens, they should all be hanged to the last man.

01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:27.700
And the city should be left to the children.

01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:33.700
Yeah, and that's, by the way, this is in Turkey, so it's not like he's in Asia already.

01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:37.700
He's in the Persian Empire. This is a part of Greece that was ruled by the Persian Empire.

01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:44.700
His buddy, Hermodorus, is literally the Persian governor, the governor of the Persians appointed to rule Ephesus.

01:13:44.700 --> 01:14:00.700
And when Hermodorus is deposed in an attempted coup by the Ephesians, an attempted Greek revolt against Persian rule, he says these Greeks here, these morons, these rabble, he calls them rabble, uneducated,

01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:13.700
mass, unthinking herd of people who, in the name of democracy, revolted against Hermodorus, he says they should all be executed to the last man, leave the children to run the city.

01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:15.700
And then, okay, so.

01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:19.700
He was in the category of Thales, too. Thales was a monotheist, I'm not mistaken.

01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:33.700
Yes. And then, in the midst of this situation, Darius, the Persian emperor, sends a letter to Heraclitus saying, come be the court philosopher of Iran.

01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:34.700
Wow.

01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:47.700
Darius the Great, in all of his inscriptions on mountain sides in Iran, on rock cliffs in Iran, prefaces his decrees with, in the name of Ahura Mazda, and of Arta.

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:48.700
Absolutely.

01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:49.700
Absolutely.

01:14:49.700 --> 01:15:02.700
He's a Zoroastrian monarch. He's legitimating himself through the teachings of Zarathustra. And he says to Heraclitus, come be the court philosopher of the Persian Empire.

01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:06.700
Now, if you didn't think that this guy was Zoroastrian in his thinking.

01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:16.700
No way he would be asked to be a court philosopher if he didn't already have a line thinking. To a high degree, too. Not just a little.

01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:17.700
To a high degree.

01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:22.700
If he didn't epitomize the worldview of the ancient Iranians.

01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:23.700
Wow.

01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:29.700
So, this is really telling. And then what does Heraclitus do? He writes him back.

01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:40.700
And he basically says, thank you, but no thank you. I don't think court life would suit me. It's a little too luxurious for me. And I'm not going to abandon my post.

01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:41.700
Yeah.

01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:52.700
And, you know, you should come here. And so, instead, Heraclitus goes and he exiles himself to the temple of Artemis. He doesn't leave the temple for the rest of his life.

01:15:52.700 --> 01:16:01.700
Because his attitude is basically, I hate these people. These are not my kinsmen. These people revolted against her, you know, her motorists who revolted against the Persians.

01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:09.700
And he makes the temple of Artemis, again, Arta Amesha, immortal truth, this Iranian goddess figure, right?

01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:14.700
He makes her temple his home for the rest of his life.

01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:23.700
And this is where the fragments were, you know, kept. The first copy of the fragments were kept by the priestesses of the temple of Artemis.

01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:30.700
And he would only come out to play with children on the steps of the temple. The children that, you know, parents would bring when they came to worship Artemis.

01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:34.700
They would leave their children on the temple steps and Heraclitus would be out there playing games with these children.

01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:40.700
I prefer to talk to them than to talk to any of you. I'll play with the children, thank you very much.

01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:53.700
And so, so anyway, and by the way, there's this beautiful fragment where he says that the Aeon is a child at play, moving pieces in a game.

01:16:53.700 --> 01:17:07.700
Sovereignty belongs to the child. And this is Heraclitus understanding what Zarathustra really was after in this opposition between Sepanto Minu and Angra Minu

01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:15.700
as part of the divine intelligence of Ahura Mazda, where there is a cosmic game on like a chess game.

01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:25.700
Or like backgammon, which is Iranian in origin. And the point is to play a good game and a creative game.

01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:38.700
In any case, I think that Heraclitus did that. He maintained his post. He sequestered himself to the temple of Artemis because he was waiting for Darius to come to him, not the other way around.

01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:45.700
In other words, he was saying to the Persian Empire, you come back and reassert rule here and in Greece in general.

01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:52.700
And so in this person, very much like Pythagoras, we're dealing with an agent of the Persian Empire.

01:17:52.700 --> 01:18:05.700
These were progressive minds that saw the Persian post, saw the rule of Darius and Cyrus as like a modern or an ancient rendition of what today is like the UN.

01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:16.700
Like overarching, but also just fair, knowledgeable, intelligent and good for the world instead of having like warring states periods.

01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:19.700
Yeah. I mean, the United Nations is so corrupt.

01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:22.700
I'm just saying the idea.

01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:27.700
You know what I think it's more like, I'll tell you what I think it's more like, it's like the United States at its foundation.

01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:30.700
The Persian Empire, the United States, you know, Thomas Jefferson.

01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:32.700
Washington.

01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:43.700
Yeah, Thomas Jefferson was very deeply influenced by Iranian ideas that he got from reading Greek authors. He had a vast library of classical Greek texts, he read Greek, and he was influenced by the Persians via the Greeks.

01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:50.700
The historical constitution of the United States was very much a reflection of the Satrapi system of the Persian Empire.

01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:59.700
Exactly. Not a day of Christian because think about it. There's not a single script, not a single lick of Deuteronomy or numbers in the Constitution.

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:00.700
It is.

01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:04.700
I mean, it's prepod, look, Jefferson took scissors to the Bible.

01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:16.700
Yeah, there's despised Christianity, the founding father, Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, the Illuminati 33rd degree Freemason. Anyway, be that as it may.

01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:29.700
But to go to your point, it's more not like the UN so much. It's more like when Tom Paine says, I think it was in the rights of man, the book that he wrote.

01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:33.700
Did he write the rights of men in prison in France? I think so.

01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:34.700
Yeah.

01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:48.700
And so Tom Paine, the black sheep of the founding fathers, he says that the Liberty Bell of the American Revolution is not just for all nations on Earth, it should resound through the whole cosmos.

01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:51.700
Same guy who called Christ a fable too.

01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:54.700
Oh, he destroyed the Bible.

01:19:54.700 --> 01:20:07.700
Anyway, not only did he think the US Constitution shouldn't be based on the Bible, he said that the US Constitution is not compatible with Christianity. And until we get rid of Christianity, we cannot have a functional government in this country.

01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:09.700
Anyway, be that as it may.

01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:21.700
When Paine is saying that the American Revolution and the system of liberty and the protection of personal rights that it's setting up is a standard for the whole world.

01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:32.700
That's what the ancient Persian emperors were after they were after creating a universal order based on progress and the liberty of the individual.

01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:35.700
So, yeah, in any case.

01:20:35.700 --> 01:21:00.700
Yeah, you just laid out, like, I think it's just completely clear that these pillars of the West, Heraclitus, Pythagoras, and then eventually Plato, and then, you know, who would be sort of passed down through the Aristotle in mind and which branches out in many different directions.

01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:09.700
And this comes from Saurastra. He's the, he's the monad in its own in its own way like figure speech.

01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:29.700
Where am I going with this where I'm going with this is that, look, if the, if the Carpacrasians are worshiping statues of, or at least honoring statues of Pythagoras, and then of Plato, who's influenced by Pythagoras and Heraclitus.

01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:36.700
What does that tell you about where the Carpacrasian teaching is coming from originally, right?

01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:47.700
And I want to come back to the Carpacrasians in one minute and this is going to become really important. The point about Saurastra and the Carpacrasians and then Persian Gnosticism.

01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:52.700
But let me also note that in your, I was listening to your conversation with, is it David, David, David?

01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:54.700
I'm David Litwa.

01:21:54.700 --> 01:22:15.700
Yeah. And Litwa, in response to a question you asked very rightly about Persian influence on Simon Magus and Litwa says, No, you know, there was a much closer source for Simon Magus than anything Zoroastrian and that would have been Heraclitus.

01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:19.700
Well, we've already established how deeply influenced by Zarathustra Heraclitus is. Okay.

01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:29.700
But I don't buy that Simon Magus is getting these ideas, even from Zarathustra via Heraclitus, I think he's getting them directly from Zarathustra.

01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:38.700
And I'll tell you why when he describes the, you know, divine intelligence, not just as a cosmic fire, which is a very Zoroastrian symbol that you find in Heraclitus.

01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:41.700
Yes, he calls God a fire. He said God is a fire.

01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:48.700
He also talks about the seventh power and you don't find this in Heraclitus.

01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:52.700
This is nowhere in Heraclitus. It's nowhere in any Greek thought.

01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:58.700
The seventh power or emanation of the divine intelligence, which is thought, the divine thought, right?

01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:02.700
The thinking power of the divine, which is a seventh emanation.

01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:14.700
That's Sipantaminu. There are seven Amesha spent, seven of them. The seventh one, the highest one is Sipantaminu, which is what the power of thought, the divine thought, right?

01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:18.700
I forgot about that. I wasn't even putting two to two together. That makes a lot of sense now.

01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:31.700
It's the divine mind of Ahura Mazda, which Zarathustra and the Gathas says that, you know, the mind of Ahura Mazda exploded into myriad sparks of light and manifested the cosmic order, you know, in the Gathas.

01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:37.700
So Christianity, with all these mages and Magoys, this is sort of another thing.

01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:44.700
It's a descendant, a branch off of this Magi Zoroastrian.

01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:51.700
Exactly. Look, Simon Magus, there's a reason he's called, whether he likes to call him Magus or not, there's a reason he was called that.

01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:54.700
He was called Magus because he was a Magi. He was a member of the Order of the Magi.

01:23:55.700 --> 01:24:10.700
And one of the first Christian cults to be in Rome, like during the time of St. Linus, who's supposedly the guy who was anointed by Peter, were talking like the first century, these Simonians who were worshiping Simon Magus, apparently.

01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:21.700
According to Irenaeus and Hippolytus, who knows how accurate it is, but let's take them at their word value, then that means the first Christians to show up in Rome were Magi.

01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:31.700
And this whole notion that some scholars, Western, I was going to use an epithet, but I'll just pass over that.

01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:43.700
A lot of Western scholars try to dismiss the significance of this term Magus by saying, well, you know, it just meant the practitioner of magic or alchemy or whatever.

01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:55.700
No, no, look, the Greeks who brought magic to Greece were accused of Medism. There was a crime in Greece called Medism.

01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:56.700
Really?

01:24:56.700 --> 01:25:04.700
Coming from the Medes, the Median people, one of the four branches of the ancient Iranians. The Medes are closest to today's Kurds.

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:13.700
And so, and they ruled Iran before the Persians. The Persians overtook the Medes and incorporated them into the Persian Empire.

01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:23.700
So the Medes were the first Iranians that the Greeks had encountered and the Magi are the priests or wise men of the Medes.

01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:41.700
And Magi, wise men of the Medes, people practicing magic in Greece, and also the revolutionary pre-Socratic philosophers were accused of Medism, meaning bringing foreign Iranian, Iranian specifically ideas to Greece in a way that's considered treasonous.

01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:47.700
Like, you know, the McCarthy hearings in America where they were all calling these guys commies and Russian agents and whatever.

01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:53.700
Well, like Socrates' trial, he gets executed for importing foreign deities. No one even knows what those are.

01:25:53.700 --> 01:26:07.700
His teacher, Socrates' teacher, Espacia, I mean, she wasn't, like I said, the guy was a bum. So she wasn't his teacher in any formal sense, but there was this older woman that he hung out with and he was very influenced by her Espacia.

01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:12.700
And she was a mistress of Pericles, I believe.

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:18.700
And anyway, she was accused of Medism. She was one of these people who actually was charged with Medism.

01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:29.700
So it's not true that Magus just meant magician. Magus had a very culturally specific connotation and it meant those people associated with that Iranian shit over there.

01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:32.700
I've actually heard someone else tell me exactly what you said is not.

01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:40.700
Other people very, very entrenched in this type of area that that's it was became a slang term.

01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:45.700
Yeah, yeah, like you're a Magi, but really that just could mean a million things.

01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:49.700
Right. You know, it's like Gnostic. Like, what's a Gnostic? I don't know.

01:26:49.700 --> 01:27:04.700
My point is it had a culturally specific association. And so aside from the fact that you've got Simon Magus talking about cosmic fire and the seventh power as the divine intellect, God's power of thought, which you don't find even in Heraclitus.

01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:09.700
You know, the guys identified as a major, you know, as a member of the major in order.

01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:19.700
So, yeah, so you got this association of Simon Magus with Zarathustra and then to go back to the Carpacrations. Okay.

01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:27.700
This is something I think your viewers may not be familiar with and it's tremendously significant.

01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:49.700
So the Carpacrations were accused of having all these basically ecstatic orgies and, you know, that they were libertines who believed in not just relinquishing private property, but in overcoming the notion of

01:27:50.700 --> 01:28:05.700
property that underlies monogamous marriage. In other words, holding other people as property, right? Being able to overcome the aspects of the human ego that express themselves in greed and

01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:09.700
avaricious behavior.

01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:33.700
And so they were radical communists who didn't only want to abolish private property, they thought that love was somehow diminished or constrained by monogamous marriage and its association with property holding and the whole patriarchal economic system of the time.

01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:51.700
And interestingly enough, there is a Gnostic sect in Iran, who has exactly this same teaching called the Mazdikites. And these Mazdikites claimed to be the true heirs to the teaching of Zarathustra.

01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:57.700
They thought that the Sasanid Persian Empire, the second Persian Empire.

01:28:57.700 --> 01:29:08.700
There are three Iranian empires in antiquity, the Achaemenid Empire, the Parthian Empire and the Sasanid Empire, but the Parthians were Scythians. They were not Persians.

01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:18.700
So the second Persian Empire is the Sasanid Persian Empire from about 200 AD to 650 when they were conquered by Islam 650 AD.

01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:26.700
And during the Sasanid Persian Empire, these Mazdikites, again Mazda means wisdom, right?

01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:27.700
Right.

01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:37.700
These Mazdikites, they argued that the Sasanid priesthood had set up an orthodoxy that was a total perversion of the teachings of Zarathustra.

01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:47.700
And they represented the true teachings of Zarathustra. And interestingly enough, they're advocating communism, the abolishing of private property, right?

01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:57.700
But then also free love and a transcendence of monogamous marriage and basically, you know, open, you know, amorous relationships between men and women and so forth.

01:29:57.700 --> 01:30:07.700
Which was, for them, also a way of breaking up harems and destroying aristocratic bloodlines, right, destroying the landed feudal aristocracy.

01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:23.700
And although the, okay, so now the Mazdikites, as radical as this teaching seems, the Mazdikites were able to seize control of the Sasanid Persian Empire for no less than 30 years in the early 500s,

01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:43.700
505 to 520s, 530 AD, through a court minister called Mazdak, this movement, which was subsequently named after him, but had an older name I'll come to in a moment.

01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:59.700
This movement seized control of the Persian state. There was a king who, Kovac, who supposedly was sympathetic to it, and he basically let Mazdak have free reign and they took over the government and they created a, I mean, insane, radical,

01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:06.700
Gnostic communist society in Iran for 30 years.

01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:07.700
Wow.

01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:11.700
Okay, before they were finally, of course, you can imagine how the story ended, they were all master.

01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:13.700
Israel for Islam comes around.

01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:27.700
Right, exact. Well, the trauma of this incident is, I think, in large part what rendered the Persian Empire vulnerable to being conquered by Islam. There had been an internal revolution and civil war before the Arabs came in and made short work of it.

01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:30.700
That's why the Persian Empire was so vulnerable.

01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:31.700
Yeah.

01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:34.700
They had basically turned on themselves first.

01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:36.700
Makes a lot of sense.

01:31:36.700 --> 01:31:52.700
And here's my point is that if you look in the heresy, hereseological texts about the Mazdakites, they all say that this movement was already hundreds of years old when it took control of the state, which kind of makes sense.

01:31:52.700 --> 01:32:02.700
I mean, for it to have become that powerful and entrenched that it could actually topple the government, it would take a long time to build that kind of following throughout the whole of the Persian Empire.

01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:10.700
And they say the movement actually goes back to at least 200 AD.

01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:13.700
And when are we dealing with the Carpacrasian order?

01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:18.700
About 100, about 50 to 50 to 100 years earlier.

01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:19.700
Right.

01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:23.700
And so these are very close in historical timeframe.

01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:37.700
Oh, and not to mention the writings that are found from Nag Hammadi and other places in Egypt like Alexandria that are related to movements such as the Carpacritus and other movements, mostly in Egypt, Christianity.

01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:40.700
They're Zoraster and his grandfather.

01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:41.700
What's his name?

01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:42.700
Zossimovs, I think it is.

01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:43.700
Yes.

01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:50.700
But yeah, there's, it's not even, this is not even like hidden or like through philosophy is through philosophy.

01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:56.700
They're literally reading and translating in Coptic, the writings of Zoraster and his grandfather.

01:32:56.700 --> 01:32:57.700
Right.

01:32:57.700 --> 01:33:03.700
And so they say this movement goes back to like, at least 280.

01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:12.700
And it comes from the state of Iran, the province of Iran, from which the Persian Empire gets its name, namely Persis, Persa.

01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:13.700
Right.

01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:23.700
And which is around where Shiraz is today. It's where Persepolis, the ruins of Persepolis are. It's where the city of Shiraz is, where, you know, the Shiraz wine comes from and so on and so forth.

01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:33.700
Anyway, they say the guy who founded this movement, which was originally called Dorostinan, or the partisans of justice.

01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:35.700
Remember that text, the Carpacritian text on justice?

01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:36.700
Yeah.

01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:37.700
Social justice.

01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:41.700
So it was called the movement of the just.

01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:48.700
And its founder was a guy called Zardost, which is a middle Persian Zarathustra.

01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:57.700
So we have the second Zarathustra, the second Zoroaster preaching this doctrine, which is identical to the Carpacritian doctrine.

01:33:57.700 --> 01:34:07.700
And then the Carpacritians are setting up statues of Pythagoras and a Plato who's influenced by Pythagoras and by Heraclitus, both of whom were Persian agents.

01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:12.700
And not incidentally, I neglected to mention that the magi attended Plato's funeral.

01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:13.700
Oh, that's right.

01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:14.700
That's a big one.

01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:21.700
They came from Iran. They attended Plato's funeral. And they said he was one of our own. They attended in the capacity of like honoring a brother.

01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:22.700
That's a big deal.

01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:27.700
Oh, Zostrianos. That's the guy's name. Is that really his grandfather? Zoroaster's grandfather?

01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:33.700
I don't think so. But I think that it's very significant that the Gnostics wanted to say that.

01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:36.700
That's what I'm saying. They're attributing, even if they're making this up.

01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:39.700
It's a pedigree. They want to establish for themselves.

01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:49.700
It shows you how entrenched, how interested, and how valuable Zoroastrian ideas were to the Gnostic movements in Egypt.

01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:51.700
Carpacritians. That's what they were.

01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:59.700
Absolutely. And then, look, I mean, we've gone for a long time, but we can't neglect Manny, right?

01:34:59.700 --> 01:35:02.700
Yeah, I'm so glad you brought that up.

01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:08.700
So many streams of Gnostic thought come from out of Manny and Manichaeism.

01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:20.700
Like, for example, the Bogomio movement of southeastern Europe, mainly associated with Bulgaria, but there's a lot of scholarship that says that it came from Constantinople originally.

01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:21.700
Interesting.

01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:33.700
The Bogomio movement. And then you've got the Cathars in the Occital region, which stretched from mainly southern France into part of Italy and part of Spain on the Mediterranean.

01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:43.700
The Cathar movement and the Bogomio movement were both branded by the inquisitors of the Catholic Church as, quote, Manichaeism, unquote.

01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:44.700
Yeah.

01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:45.700
So according to the...

01:35:45.700 --> 01:35:48.700
The call against the Maniches was the reputation.

01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:49.700
Yeah.

01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:52.700
According to the Catholic Church, these people were Manichaeans.

01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:53.700
Right.

01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:54.700
What does that tell you?

01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:57.700
That tells you this is a Persian movement to the eyes of the church.

01:35:57.700 --> 01:35:59.700
In the eyes of the church, exactly.

01:35:59.700 --> 01:36:03.700
And so, Manny, who is Manny?

01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:08.700
Manny was a Parthian royal.

01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:09.700
He was a...

01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:11.700
Remember, so I mentioned there was the second Iranian Empire.

01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:13.700
It wasn't Persian, but it was Iranian.

01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:16.700
The Parthian Empire, they were descendants of Scythians.

01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:17.700
And...

01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:19.700
They were descendants of a disciple of Jesus.

01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:20.700
Yes.

01:36:20.700 --> 01:36:37.700
And so, Manny was from a Parthian royal bloodline, born in Mesopotamia, which, again, the capital of Iran in the Parthian period was also in Mesopotamia, and had a city called Ctesiphon.

01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:44.700
And so, he's from this royal lineage and his mother is a Christian.

01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:52.700
And so, his father is a Parthian, either Zoroastrian or Mithrest, probably, in ancestry, and his mother is a Christian.

01:36:52.700 --> 01:37:05.700
And he basically develops this doctrine that intensifies the dualism latent in Zarathustra's message.

01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:07.700
So, Zarathustra is not a dualist, right?

01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:14.700
And this opposition between Sepanto-minu and Angra-minu is still sort of under the divine intelligence of Ahura Mazda.

01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:18.700
And it's not meant to suggest that there is on an ontological level.

01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:23.700
In other words, in the nature of reality, some kind of a split between a material world and a spiritual world.

01:37:23.700 --> 01:37:25.700
You don't find that in the Gaphas.

01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:28.700
So, Zarathustra is not an ontological dualist, okay?

01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:30.700
But he's got these two principles.

01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:33.700
And Manny takes these two principles of...

01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:35.700
By his time, it's Ormazd.

01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:40.700
The contraction of Ahura Mazda, Ormazd and Ahriman, contraction of Angra-minu.

01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:47.700
He takes these and he radicalizes them into a real substantive ontological dualism.

01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:55.700
And he says there are two worlds, a material world governed by Ahriman and a spiritual world like the Pluroma.

01:37:55.700 --> 01:37:58.700
That's the world of Ahura Mazda.

01:37:58.700 --> 01:38:05.700
And we are sparks of the divine that have been trapped in this material world.

01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:12.700
And we basically have it as our spiritual work to free this divine spark within us so that it can rejoin the light.

01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:18.700
You know, the realm of light and transcend this realm of dark physicality.

01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:29.700
And so he develops this Gnostic doctrine and various elements of his teaching fuse ideas from Zarathustra,

01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:41.700
the Gnostic Jesus, which at this time we're talking Manny's around 200, early 200s AD.

01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:46.700
And in fact, specifically under the reign of Shahpur the Great, and this is not incidental,

01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:56.700
Shahpur the Great, the most militarily successful emperor of the Second Persian Empire becomes the patron of Manny.

01:38:56.700 --> 01:38:59.700
He becomes his patron, which is kind of bizarre.

01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:04.700
I mean this guy like, Shahpur is like Marcus Aurelius.

01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:10.700
He expanded the Persian Empire dramatically and he takes Manny in.

01:39:10.700 --> 01:39:17.700
And I say it's bizarre because, you know, people think of Mannychism as this world denying aesthetic doctrine of like,

01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:27.700
oh, go put, you know, put yourself in a monastic cell somewhere and deny your physical impulses and try to purify your spirit and whatever.

01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:30.700
There's no way that this could have been Manny's actual teaching,

01:39:30.700 --> 01:39:36.700
even if he prescribed some kind of a monastic way of life for a certain class of people.

01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:48.700
Shahpur would never have taken in a guy like that into the court and would never have backed this guy to go on evangelical missions as far as India and China.

01:39:48.700 --> 01:39:53.700
You know, the Mannychians, their legacy survived for centuries in China.

01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:57.700
A lot of Mannychian texts that we have are actually from Northwestern China.

01:39:57.700 --> 01:40:04.700
And so Shahpur is backing this guy to go on these wide travels and what's the deal here?

01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:08.700
Well, the deal is that Shahpur is starting to conquer a large part of the Roman Empire.

01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:16.700
He's famously depicted in the Parse province of Iran that I mentioned earlier on the stones next to Persepolis.

01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:22.700
He's depicted forcing Caesar Valerian of Rome to kneel before his horse.

01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:24.700
It's a great rock carving. You can look it up.

01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:31.700
Very famous of Shahpur on horseback with Caesar Valerian of Rome on his knees looking up to Shahpur under the hooves of his horse.

01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:35.700
And so Shahpur is conquering large parts of the Roman Empire in the West.

01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:41.700
And he's conquering large parts of India and all the way up to the border of Northwestern China in the East.

01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:45.700
And so Shahpur is looking for a world religion. He wants to create one world religion.

01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:48.700
And he's looking at Manny as a guy who can do it for him.

01:40:48.700 --> 01:40:54.700
And so Manny takes Zarathustra and the Gnostic Jesus and Buddha.

01:40:54.700 --> 01:41:02.700
And he fuses them into one religion that includes belief in reincarnation and the Buddha of light.

01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:11.700
And all these ideas you find that survive in Mahayana and pure land Buddhism and so forth to create one world religion.

01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:13.700
Gnostic religion.

01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:17.700
Yeah, it's very similar to the Carpocrations in that sense where they have these three figures.

01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:31.700
Yes, and the Kathar way of life, I think tells us a lot about what Manichaeism was like because it's true that you had perfecty in the Kathar religion.

01:41:31.700 --> 01:41:36.700
They call them perfecty perfected people who lived a monastic life.

01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:39.700
And they were very aesthetic.

01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:43.700
But these perfecty would only become perfecty when they were geezers.

01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:48.700
Okay, it was old men and old women who would become perfecty.

01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:57.700
When the Kathars were younger, you know, in Occitanian culture, they were all mixed up with the troubadours who were these traveling romantic poets.

01:41:57.700 --> 01:42:02.700
And they were also clearly closely allied with the Knights Templar.

01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:08.700
And sometimes troubadours in medieval Occitan would become Kathar perfecty later in life.

01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:16.700
And sometimes Templar Knights would become Kathar perfecty after living lives full of, you know, brutal conquest, right?

01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:19.700
And these wars of, you know, conquest in the Middle East and so forth.

01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:39.700
So you've got like erotic poets who are libertines preaching basically all kinds of orgiastic, you know, practices and writing about them in these romantic poems that they sing in the courts of various medieval ladies.

01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:48.700
And you've got these, you know, military men who are certainly not pacifists for most of their lives and they're becoming Kathar perfecty.

01:42:48.700 --> 01:43:01.700
And so I think this shows you how Shahpour was able to accommodate Mani's teaching because it was not this naive, overly idealistic world denying teaching.

01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:16.700
It had different classes of worshipers and it had a realistic view of human society and the laity were not expected to adhere to this kind of asceticism that you find among the perfecty.

01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:24.700
And then of course there was a notion of reincarnation. So, you know, you had many lifetimes to perfect your soul, which you also find in the Kathars.

01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:38.700
So the Manikians are another group of Gnostics who are deeply influenced by Zarathustra. Zarathustra is one of the three great world teachers for Mani, again together like I mentioned earlier with the Gnostic Christ and with Buddha.

01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:55.700
And so another major stream of Gnosticism influenced by Zarathustra is this radically dualist school that we see coming from out of Manikism and all of its off sheets, Bogomilism, Katharism and so forth.

01:43:55.700 --> 01:44:10.700
Yeah, that's so, there's so much to, there's so much that comes all back to Zarathustra. You can just, it's like a bunch of lines of trees branches that just go back to this time period.

01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:23.700
And it's a time period that's contemporary with a lot of other, you know, Isaiah, Jose, you know, the Babylonians and, and like it's, it's just fascinating to think about it like that.

01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:41.700
I actually have a question for you because I was thinking about this, there's a high, there was the second temple period Judaism, they had these high priests that are named Harkness, and there's a, there's a thought that maybe they're from Harkania, and they were taking in priests that

01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:55.700
like new ancient rites that they somehow lost after being captive in Babylon for all these time. And they wanted to bring in like priests that knew what they were doing. So they brought in these Harkanian priests is that you can think about that.

01:44:55.700 --> 01:44:57.700
You said this is in the second temple period.

01:44:57.700 --> 01:44:58.700
Yeah.

01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:13.700
And by the way, this is right after Cyrus was called the Messiah, not by. Oh, he's a Messiah like Solomon. No, Messiah from the word of God himself, my shepherd. So that's pretty big deal.

01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:23.700
Listen, we could have a whole, a whole show on this subject because I'm about to say something that's extremely incendiary and respond to your question.

01:45:24.700 --> 01:45:31.700
By the way, if people are interested, this is the book in which I discuss Zarathustra at length. Yeah.

01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:43.700
I got a link in the description too. So people can run in Leviathan. And I'm pointing to it right now because I have a whole chapter on what I'm about to say, which is very incendiary in response to your question.

01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:45.700
But we could do a whole show on it sometime.

01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:46.700
Sure.

01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:51.700
I think you're probably right.

01:45:51.700 --> 01:46:05.700
Why? Because, again, I apologize for this in advance, but the whole thing about Cyrus being the Messiah of the Jews and why Cyrus rebuilt the temple of Solomon.

01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:22.700
When he relocated, when he left the Jews of Babylon who had been in captivity, moved back home. Of course, a lot of them stayed back in Babylon. And by the way, do you know what the Jews who stayed back and behind in Babylon and capital of the Persian Empire did instead of returning to Israel?

01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:26.700
They ran the banking system.

01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:38.700
The Persian emperor set up the first banking system of the world with standardized coinage. They invented checks. Checks were invented by the Persian emperor, specifically by Darius the Great.

01:46:38.700 --> 01:46:47.700
And the Jews were involved in the Babylonian banking system under the Persian Empire.

01:46:47.700 --> 01:47:02.700
And anyway, long story short, I make an argument in Iranian Leviathan in a chapter that I playfully titled this chapter.

01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:13.700
Tekel, tekel, man is shekel. Yeah, that's from Daniel. Yeah. Well, it's a play on the words in Daniel. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tekel, tekel, man is shekel because the shekel.

01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:29.700
Shekel means image in Persian. It means face. And it was specifically referring to the face of Darius on the coins called Darax. And so the word for money in Hebrew comes from the image of Darius the Great on Persian coinage.

01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:44.700
In any case, I'm getting diverted. Yeah, the whole business of Cyrus the Great and the creation of the Second Temple and the relocation of the Jews, their, their, you know, their Odyssey back home to Israel.

01:47:44.700 --> 01:47:55.700
Okay. And the writing of the Hebrew Bible as we know it today, which dates back to that time under Cyrus and Cambyses.

01:47:55.700 --> 01:48:01.700
Yeah. The whole thing was a Persian plot.

01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:14.700
I make an argument for this in Iranian Leviathan. Second Temple Judaism is a creation of an Illuminati elite who were myth rests in the Persian Empire.

01:48:14.700 --> 01:48:31.700
And the transformation that we see inside Judaism, which are extensive at that time that involved notions like punishment in hell, individual soul, becoming apocalypse. I mean, all these ideas that you don't find at all in ancient Israelite religion.

01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:43.700
And they are social engineering mechanisms that were specifically introduced into Judaism by myth reik.

01:48:43.700 --> 01:48:54.700
I don't even want to call them priests myth reik social engineers who had a much wider agenda in terms of creating a new world order is what they were really after.

01:48:54.700 --> 01:49:07.700
The banking system was part of that new world order, but a transformation in religion was also part of that new world order. And so Cyrus Cyrus was not a Zoroastrian Cyrus was a myth rest.

01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:18.700
I make an argument for this. And the guy who he appointed to be responsible for the Second Temple project and the relocation of the Jews was a man named Mithra Dotties, which means myth was justice.

01:49:18.700 --> 01:49:19.700
Right.

01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:27.700
Yeah, so I would not be at all surprised if they brought your canyons. Yeah, yeah, Israel.

01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:39.700
There was two of them that name too. And that's when baptism becomes a thing in Judaism to at that time. So it all just makes sense. And the last thing I'm going to say that I'm going to blow some people's minds with this, I want to get your opinion.

01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:49.700
And then we can finish off. You can tie it all together. Last thing I want to say is this because the that movement continues up until the time of Pompey and Caesar.

01:49:49.700 --> 01:49:54.700
So the same year. Well, I should say, before that crisis tries to go into Parthia.

01:49:55.700 --> 01:50:14.700
It's killed. Pompey, the great sex temple of Jerusalem. And there's a big, that's a big deal, because now the priesthood that is held by the Persians is now in the hands of guess what, the same year 63 BC, that Pompey sex Jerusalem is the same year they hold an election.

01:50:14.700 --> 01:50:31.700
And, and, and Julius Caesar becomes the high priest of the entire Roman Empire, Pontifus Maximus, same title as Pope right now, by the way, guess who else, guess what else happens that year. Cicero is console, and Augustus is born, baby Augustus.

01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:36.700
And they're in the writers of what's his name. I can't remember the guy's name who wrote this.

01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:46.700
Anyway, it's passed down through like Tacitus and Sonia. They're all they're all talking about this. And this is widespread. And you can go look this up. It's public knowledge. There was a supposedly a star in the sky.

01:50:46.700 --> 01:50:54.700
Said any male to be born this year will be the king of the world. So they're basically saying glasses is like a messiah. Anyways, long story short, let's fast forward a little bit.

01:50:54.700 --> 01:51:00.700
Julius Caesar gets killed. Julius Caesar had plans to go east. He had plans to do it. He wanted to.

01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:09.700
Alexander the Great was his God, basically he wanted to be the next Alexander the Great, but he couldn't do it. Mark Antony also wanted to do the same thing.

01:51:09.700 --> 01:51:20.700
But he ends up battling with Augustus. Now the question is, why didn't Augustus do it. But Gus has had all the, all the, all the stars were aligned for Augustus to go east and do it Alexander the Great did.

01:51:20.700 --> 01:51:37.700
And I'll tell you why Nicholas of Damascus tells us why the, the, the king of India, porous, same name as the king that under Alexander the Great just coincidentally, he sends delegates, Brahmin delegates to go meet with Augustus, and they bring him

01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:53.700
to the lions and oils and fragments and all these exotic presents and money and basically make a deal. And it's, and the reason why I'm bringing all this up is because right after this happens, by the way, one of the delegates goes with Augustus to

01:51:54.700 --> 01:52:06.700
Lucius to get initiated in these rites. And after he's apparently he saw something when he drank, he drank, drank the kaikyan had the experience. Apparently he saw something that changed his life.

01:52:06.700 --> 01:52:15.700
He jumped into a fire after that and killed himself because he no longer had anything else to live for. He, his life was complete. He wanted to die at that moment. That's recorded Nicholas of Damascus.

01:52:15.700 --> 01:52:29.700
Anyway, the reason why I brought all that up is because right after this, Augustus dedicate 72 temples across the, across the Empire, and a lot of them were Mithra temples, and he becomes obsessed with the fire of Vesta.

01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:35.700
No, no, don't let the fire of Vesta go out. And all of a sudden Mithraism is a boom in the Roman Empire.

01:52:35.700 --> 01:52:48.700
So I don't think it's a, and I think that's what happened. I think they're, I think he, something changed his mind with these delegates, and all of a sudden Eastern religions were where the hit Christianity is not even that long after that.

01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:49.700
What do you think?

01:52:49.700 --> 01:52:55.700
That's very interesting. That's a fascinating story which I hadn't heard before, but it makes a hell of a lot of sense to me.

01:52:55.700 --> 01:53:07.700
Because as we discussed in the previous show we did on Mithraism, the Parthians had, I mean of course you know Parthia was the main rival of Rome, that was Iran in the time of the Roman Empire.

01:53:07.700 --> 01:53:19.700
And so he would have had to march against the Parthians. And like we discussed in the previous show we did together the Parthians had extensive agents operating in the seats of power in the Roman Empire.

01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:39.700
And among the aristocracy in particular, they would, they would infiltrate through the port cities using the Selisian pirates. And so I could well imagine that what you're saying was some kind of a Parthian plot where they decided to use Indians as emissaries because

01:53:39.700 --> 01:53:52.700
Indians had a lot of influence in North, they basically were trying to turn North, North, you know, Northwestern India was a vassal state of the one or another Iranian Empire for almost all of its history.

01:53:52.700 --> 01:54:03.700
And the Parthians were trying to establish the same relationship with that part of India. So it's quite possible that the Indian emissaries that were sent there, you know, the Parthians knew Romans aren't going to listen to us.

01:54:03.700 --> 01:54:23.700
You know, but we can send these Indians and they can basically do a sigh up on these Romans. And, you know, get them not to invade Parthia, you know, and so who knows that makes a lot of sense in that wider context of psychological warfare between Parthia and Rome.

01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:35.700
And if you want to, I think we've covered a lot of ground, we can do this for hours. But if you want to give it, you know, anything else you want to say tying everything together or if you want to just promote your books or anything, and we'll finish off.

01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:45.700
Well, the only book I would say, which I already pointed out, I mean, a lot of these subjects we've discussed are in Iranian Leviathan. I mean, that's really my major treatment of Zarathustra.

01:54:46.700 --> 01:55:05.700
Although there's a bit about Zarathustra in particular relation to Gnosticism in this book as well, a novel folklore. I get into certain Gnostic teachings, in particular, Manichaeism, and the ways in which it develops Zoroastrian ideas.

01:55:06.700 --> 01:55:24.700
But, you know, I had been thinking to go on to a discussion of modern Gnosticism, but I see in retrospect that we could do a whole show on that subject, because you see Zarathustra is rediscovered in the modern period in the 1700s by linguists,

01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:38.700
Darmester, and others who translate the Zen, the Vesta for the first time, into European languages. And then you've got people like Hegel and Nietzsche reading these texts in German translation.

01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:49.700
And Zarathustra then becomes very important for modern, you know, like early modern European culture, to the point where you have Zarathustra become the mouthpiece for Nietzsche.

01:55:49.700 --> 01:56:02.700
And thus spoke Zarathustra and, you know, Richard Strauss, naming ultimately, you know, orchestral piece after Zarathustra, Mozart, in Mozart's Magic Flute, he appears as Zarastro.

01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:14.700
So there's this whole revival of Zarathustra. Voltaire refers to Zarathustra as the religious prophet most suitable to the ideals of the Age of Enlightenment.

01:56:15.700 --> 01:56:17.700
He calls him Zarastro, of course.

01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:24.700
Does Carl Jung have anything to do with it? Because I know he revamps Gnosticism in his own way, big time.

01:56:24.700 --> 01:56:29.700
I'm sure Zarathustra is mentioned in Jung. Of course, Jung engages with Nietzsche.

01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:30.700
Yeah.

01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:35.700
So, you know, via Nietzsche, you know, he engages with Zarathustra.

01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:47.700
But Jungian psychology is so deeply indebted to the ideas that Plato absorbed from Zarathustra, in particular, you know, the archetypes, right?

01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:48.700
Yeah, that's a good point.

01:56:48.700 --> 01:57:03.700
Right? So, and then the aspects of Jung that are often referred to as Gnostic, when people say, call Jung a Gnostic, those are really Zarathustrian, not to say Zarastrian, but they go back to Zarathustra.

01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:05.700
Because, see, Jung is not a dualist.

01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:11.700
There's a lot of aspects of Jungian thought that don't fit various facets of Gnosticism.

01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:22.700
And the aspects of Jung that are Gnostic are the ones that Gnosticism shares in common with Zarathustra's teaching or really has inherited from Zarathustra's teaching.

01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:24.700
Okay, so that's...

01:57:25.700 --> 01:57:39.700
That's a thing because in the Red Book, he even talks about this whole battle between Satan and Christ and nobody wins and ends up being like this giant explosion where Abraxas comes out and he's like the embodiment of all.

01:57:39.700 --> 01:57:41.700
He's everything.

01:57:41.700 --> 01:57:42.700
Like he is, you can't escape Abraxas.

01:57:42.700 --> 01:57:43.700
He's basically the one.

01:57:43.700 --> 01:57:46.700
They didn't say that, but that's basically what he's, you know, getting at.

01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:49.700
That's very similar to Zorvan ideas.

01:57:49.700 --> 01:57:51.700
And I know at some point you wanted to discuss the...

01:57:51.700 --> 01:57:53.700
Yeah, we should get into that.

01:57:54.700 --> 01:58:04.700
So, you know, I'm envisioning another program we do together that's focused on what Eric Vogelin calls modern Gnosticism.

01:58:04.700 --> 01:58:13.700
In other words, the Gnosticism of the period of like Hegel and Nietzsche and, you know, even Auguste Compton and so forth.

01:58:13.700 --> 01:58:15.700
The Age of Enlightenment, right?

01:58:15.700 --> 01:58:17.700
Going into the 19th century.

01:58:17.700 --> 01:58:24.700
Gnosticism in that context and the rediscovery of Zarathustra in that context, right?

01:58:24.700 --> 01:58:39.700
And that could be a context for also engaging with Zorvanism because people said that, for example, Adler referred to Nietzsche as a Zorvanist parcy without really knowing it,

01:58:39.700 --> 01:58:50.700
that Nietzsche's take on Zarathustra was basically the type of interpretation and adaptation of Zarathustra that we see in the ancient Zorvanites.

01:58:50.700 --> 01:58:55.700
So, yeah, we could have a whole program on that and I look forward to continuing the conversation there.

01:58:55.700 --> 01:59:02.700
Well, guys, leave in the comments what you guys thought about all this and if you want to add anything to the conversation, I will read them.

01:59:02.700 --> 01:59:08.700
And we will do this again in the near future and you have just attained true Gnosis.

01:59:09.700 --> 01:59:16.700
The Demiurge has no power over you.

01:59:39.700 --> 01:59:45.700
The Demiurge has no power over you.

01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:51.700
The Demiurge has no power over you.

01:59:51.700 --> 01:59:57.700
The Demiurge has no power over you.

01:59:57.700 --> 02:00:03.700
The Demiurge has no power over you.

02:00:03.700 --> 02:00:08.700
The Demiurge has no power over you.
