0	2400	Angra Minu, right? What is this Angra Minu?
2400	5100	Gere constrain, constricted.
5100	12800	This is the force, or counter force, is constraining progress, is suffocating life.
12800	16600	It means that Hora Mazda is not omnipotent, okay?
16600	18800	He's neither omnipotent nor omniscient.
18800	22900	And this is really important because many theologians have recognized,
22900	27900	and on account of this fact, Zoroastrianism doesn't face the problem of evil.
28000	31000	In any religion where you have an omniscient and omnipotent God,
31000	34300	you know, there's the problem of God being responsible for all the evil in the world,
34300	37700	you cannot have free will and have an omnipotent and omniscient God.
37700	43300	Observe, discern, and choose which of the forces you want to align yourself with.
43300	46300	The Devas are aligned with Angra Minu.
46300	49300	There is this very strange passage in the Gathus,
49300	54000	which if you ask me aligns with the myth of Atlantis that you find in Plato,
54000	58300	that when the Devas were deliberating, Angra Minu came in
58300	62500	and he as a great deceiver confused their deliberations
62500	66000	and they rushed in wrath and destroyed the life of mankind.
66000	67200	Well, what is this talking about?
67200	70600	This is talking about when Zeus calls a convocation of the Olympians
70600	74900	and they decide to destroy the world through a great deluge, right?
74900	82100	And in particular, they're targeting the Atlanteans who have rebelled against Olympus.
82100	85900	So the Devas, the gods are aligned with Angra Minu or Ahrim.
85900	88200	Notice now the Gnostic structure is already becoming clear.
88200	91000	These heavenly powers that stand between us
91000	94400	and the true divine intelligence of the cosmos.
94400	96900	So the Devas are the Archons.
96900	101400	Zarathustra's take on the Devas or Deves, they are the Archons.
101400	103500	They're the prototype for the Gnostic Archon.
113100	119400	Welcome back to the Gnostic Informant and you are about to attain true Gnosis.
119400	126700	And I'm with Dr. Jason Giorgiani today, author of Prometheism and lovers of Sophia.
126700	130200	And guys, this is once in a while I get him on.
130200	132200	Last time he was on, everybody loved it.
132200	137700	So we're going to go deep this time into Zoroaster and the roots of Gnosticism.
137700	143500	And you might not know the roots of Gnosticism are not in the Greco-Roman world.
143500	146100	They're in the East, they're in Persia.
146100	148700	And we're about to demonstrate that in this conversation.
148700	150200	So how are you doing today?
150200	153100	It's great to be with you, Neil.
153100	157600	You know, I had been meaning to come back on the show earlier
157600	162100	and I do occasionally watch your programs and really looking forward to this opportunity
162100	169600	to familiarize your audience with potentially the Persian origins of Gnosticism.
169600	170800	Yeah, this will be fun.
170800	173300	So why don't we start with Zoroaster?
173300	175700	Why don't we start with who is he?
175700	176700	What is his teachings?
176700	178000	There's the Gathas.
178000	180800	There's the San Mnvesta.
180800	181900	What is it?
181900	184500	Let's get to the start of all this and who this guy is.
184500	185400	What time period?
185400	186600	All that.
186600	187200	Right.
187200	198700	So the Gathas are a text that's been, you know, extremely controversial and polarizing
198700	205300	in the scholarly community, not only within Iranology or Iranian studies itself,
205300	208100	but in the broader field of Indo-European studies.
208100	212200	There's been great controversy about the date of this text.
212200	215100	And so, but let me just start with its name for a minute.
215100	216700	Gathas.
216700	218000	Gatha, okay.
218000	223300	So of course, the language in which this text is composed, this ancient Iranian language
223300	225900	is a sister language of Sanskrit.
225900	232000	In fact, it's very close to Sanskrit and this factors into the dating debates over this text.
232000	235400	So the word Gatha is the cognate of the word Gita.
235400	240400	So Gita like Bhagavad Gita, Gatha is the cognate of Gita.
240400	245300	And it's related to the word Gath in the Germanic languages.
245300	256200	So Gathic, Gita and Gathas are all related and they have something to do with a hymn of praise.
256200	256700	Okay.
256700	259600	And having to do with the divine with God.
259600	262400	Got in German means God, right?
262400	268100	And Gita means sort of song of praise or hymn of praise.
268100	273300	So that's the meaning of the word for this text, the name of this text.
273300	278200	And it brings us into the question of dating it based on its linguistics.
278200	287700	So the problem is that this language that the Gathas is composed in and it was believed by some
287700	290500	to have been an oral text that was only subsequently written down.
290500	293000	I'll tell you why I don't agree with that.
293000	296100	But this language is very close to Rig Vetic.
296100	296800	Okay.
296800	303500	So it's like a really ancient form of similar to an ancient form of Sanskrit much older than
303500	308500	the Sanskrit of the Bhagavad Gita's older than the younger Upanishads.
308500	317300	And so people have assumed some scholars have that it dates from like 1500 to 1000 BC.
317300	326200	So either slightly older or contain slightly older than or contemporaneous with the Upanishads.
326200	333500	And or with the Vedas somewhere between the Vedas and the Upanishad.
333500	341200	But the problem is that if you compare the Gathas to the Vedas, the level of philosophical
341200	348700	complexity in this text and the first person narrative style of it doesn't mesh at all
348700	351200	with Rig Vetic culture.
351200	357400	Stylistically what you find in the Gathas is very much of a piece with pre-Socratic philosophy.
357400	362700	It reads like Parmenides or Heraclitus or something like that.
362700	363100	Okay.
363100	367100	It's a profoundly philosophical text, very complex conceptually.
367100	372700	And it's also written in the first person, which makes it in a way even more modern than
372700	374700	the pre-Socratic Greeks.
374700	378700	This is like a guy telling you what he thinks about the world and even mentioning his friends
378700	380700	and stuff that he's been through in his life.
380700	387200	And not at all in this anonymous mythic style of composition that we find in the Upanishads
387200	392200	or even in Homer or any text of that degree of antiquity.
392200	394700	It's almost modern in its style.
394700	403700	It's like the idiom that you start to find in classical Athens and then that becomes very popular in the Roman Empire.
403700	412200	Okay. So for that reason, I really question, you know, dating this to 1000 to 1500 BC.
412200	417200	I also question it because there's a big religious conflict that's depicted in this text.
417200	421700	Zarathustra is a rebel against some existing priestly order.
421700	430700	He is basically engaging in a kind of spiritual philosophical insurrection against both ritualistic sacrificial priests
431200	434200	and these warlord princes.
434200	437200	And he calls these the catapun.
437200	439200	Catapun is a word that becomes borbon later.
439200	443200	It means sacrifice, sacrificial mumbling priests.
443200	449200	He calls them and he means like the way they mindlessly recite all these, you know, hymns and mantras and so forth.
449200	454200	And then these warlord princes called the Kavis.
454700	462700	And so, you know, people have assumed this refers to Rig Vedic priests and the Rig Vedic Shatriya or princely class.
462700	471700	But actually, if you look in the details of the text, you see, it fits much more the context of Scythian Mithraism.
471700	482700	The kind of, as he describes them, mad drunken warlords that go on cattle raids that are the backdrop for the message of the Gathas,
482700	494200	fit the Scythian warlords who were coming down into the Persian and Median territories around 700, 600 B.C.
494200	500200	and raiding the farmlands of the settled population in Persia and media.
500200	511200	And just to bunch it real quick, just in case anyone doesn't know, archaeology reflects how widespread these Mithraic temples and places were
511700	515700	from Britain all the way to like Siberia, basically in the Bronze Age.
515700	517700	But yeah, I just wanted to just throw that in there.
517700	518700	Yeah, yeah.
518700	523700	And let me just also throw in a note on a completely, you know, different tangent.
523700	526700	If anyone hears background noise, I must apologize.
526700	531700	I'm in New York City and being in Manhattan in particular, one of the things you have to deal with is constant construction.
531700	535700	There's a huge, hopefully they're going to be on their lunch break right now and we won't have to deal with them.
535700	536700	But we'll see.
536700	543200	In any case, so the backdrop of Zarathustra is ancient Iranian Mithraism, if you ask me.
543200	548200	That's what the details of the Gathas really, you know, aligned with.
548200	554200	And also we have to consider two events in this man's life.
554200	556200	One, his self-exile.
556200	566200	Apparently, his message was so revolutionary and he was so badly persecuted for wherever he was born and raised that he had to migrate over a long distance
566200	570700	and accept the patronage of this king called Vishtaspa.
570700	579700	This feudal lord or, you know, petty king called Vishtaspa, Kavi Vishtaspa or Kegoshtasp in the later Persian.
579700	585200	And it appears that the court of Kegoshtasp was in present day Khurasan.
585200	592700	That's northeastern Iran, right under Turkmenistan and next to Afghanistan, next to the Afghan border.
592700	597200	And so the point being, he wasn't from there, okay?
597200	599200	There's a debate over where he was from as well.
599200	609700	But if that's where Goshtaspa court was, then he came to there from somewhere else and it lends more credence to the Zoroastrian biographies,
609700	616700	later written Zoroastrian biographies that suggest he was from Azerbaijan, from the province of Iran known as Azerbaijan,
616700	621700	the ancient name of which was Azar Padeghan, meaning the bastion of the fire.
621700	629200	And it was a mainly median territory and the Magi were the traditional priests of the Medes.
629200	631200	So that makes sense.
631200	640200	And it makes sense that this guy pissed off mythraic priests in media, greater media.
640700	651700	And he had to basically go into self-exile, flee for his life, to Khurasan, to northeastern Iran, going towards Central Asia.
651700	655200	And so, okay, why is this relevant to the date?
655200	667700	Because Zarathustra is killed in some kind of an invasion by people called Turanian in the Shahnameh, in the Iranian national epic.
668200	673700	These people are called Turanians. They come from a place called Turan, which is in Central Asia.
673700	678200	And this is another name for the Sakhas or the Skithian people.
678200	681700	They were descended from a guy called Tur.
681700	686700	And so one name for them are the Turanians. We know them in the West as the Skithians.
686700	692700	When was there a Skithian rampage like this of Khurasan where someone like Zarathustra could have been killed?
692700	704700	It took place in about, let's say, it was the time when Cyrus the Great had overthrown the Median Kingdom.
704700	711700	And the Median Kingdom, its border had come right up against Central Asia, okay?
711700	714700	And so right up against Skithian territory.
714700	723700	And when Cyrus the Great, the founder of the First Persian Empire, when he overthrew his grandfather, Astyages of Media,
723700	728700	there was this vacuum of power briefly where there was chaos. Nobody knew who was really in charge.
728700	733700	And so the Skithians came down and they overran the Medes and the Persians for a brief period of time.
733700	741700	So it looks like this puts Zarathustra at the date which the Zarastrians themselves claimed he lived.
741700	751700	And they say that conventional Zarastrian scriptures say that Zarathustra was 258 years before Alexander.
751700	761700	And what they mean is 258 years not before the birth of Alexander, but before the coming of Alexander to Iran, before his invasion of the Persian Empire.
761700	767700	And so that puts Zarathustra in the generation before Cyrus.
767700	778700	And so this means that Zarathustra was an old man at the time when Cyrus the Great had overthrown, you know, Astyages of Media and was trying to form the Persian Empire.
778700	787700	So those dates all aligned perfectly. And that also puts us right at the dawn of philosophy, right?
787700	800700	I mean these pre-Socratics, Heraclitus, immediately before him Pythagoras, and so forth, Parmenides after Heraclitus, these are all in the like 500s, okay, 500s BC.
800700	802700	Explosion of intellect.
802700	810700	Exactly. So if you put Zarathustra in 1500 or 1000 BC, it doesn't make any sense in terms of the intellectual context.
810700	812700	I mean, he would be a total anomaly.
812700	818700	If you put Zarathustra at, let's see, what would it be?
818700	828700	It would be 628 BC. If we go by the conventional Zoroastrian dating, he would have been born in 628 BC.
828700	838700	And that means that considering the fact they claim he composed the Gathas in his 40s, it would have been around 580 BC when Zarathustra composed the Gathas.
838700	845700	Well, that's perfect. That would mean that Zarathustra was the first pre-Socratic philosopher. He has the distinction of being the first.
845700	856700	And he would then have immediately influenced the subsequent pre-Socratic thinkers, especially as we're going to discuss Pythagoras and Heraclitus.
856700	863700	And he would have influenced them by virtue of the fact that the Persian Empire conquered Ionia, which was the Greek bastion of philosophy.
863700	867700	So I think this is the proper matrix for dating Zarathustra.
867700	872700	I think that also puts him in the same timeline as people like Isaiah and Hosea.
872700	882700	And that's interesting because that's a time period where the world just kind of just shifts in its paradigm for all these ideas.
882700	890700	But my question is before we continue is why do people think that he's born in 1500 BC? Where did that even come from?
890700	901700	Yeah, linguistics alone. And so let me say one other thing about this. There is no other evidence based really upon which to base this thesis other than linguistics.
901700	910700	In other words, the fact that the idiom of the Gathas is similar to Rigvedic Sanskrit.
911700	913700	Okay, but look at Latin.
913700	914700	Yeah.
914700	930700	So, you know, we have René Descartes in the 1600s, late 1500s, early 1600s, early 1600s. We have René Descartes composing in Latin.
930700	931700	That's true.
931700	942700	Latin was used by, you know, scholars throughout the whole Middle Ages, a thousand years after the fall of the Roman Empire and of Latin having been used as a living spoken language.
942700	943700	So, okay.
943700	944700	For the commoner.
944700	946700	For the commoner, Cicero's writing in Latin.
946700	950700	Exactly. So Latin was a dead language for a thousand years or more.
950700	951700	What?
952700	970700	You know, by the time that it was still being used as a language that would confer a degree of scholastic authority on a person composing a text, either theological or intellectual authority was conveyed by composing in this dead language of Latin.
970700	983700	So why wouldn't we think that a Mead or Persian, it's debatable which Sarathustra was, he was an Iranian in any case, these are two different branches of the Iranian family, the Meads and the Persians and the Skithians.
983700	989700	These were the three major branches, okay, of the Iranian family in those days.
989700	1009700	So why would we not think that a Mead or a Persian might use this dead language, which was the language of the Magi and of the Rig Vedic priests to confer authority upon the text that he was composing, whereas it wasn't his spoken living language for all we know the guy spoke Persian.
1009700	1012700	Good point. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Okay.
1012700	1022700	So now that we, now we're in the time period, we sort of understand the context. And let's go from there. What stems from this, this sort of age of Sarathustra?
1022700	1041700	Right, so his message is absolutely revolutionary. To understand that we need to just take a quick look again, or have a refresher, because your audience I'm sure is largely familiar with this, but let's just, you know, have a refresher of the basics of Greek theology, ancient Greek theology,
1041700	1063700	and how it lines up with the, the other end of the Indo European spectrum, namely Vedic theology. So one thing that the Greeks and their, you know, their Eastern brothers still agreed on, around about 600 BC, was that the beings worthy of worship are these gods,
1063700	1074700	right? The Greeks, you know, worship these Olympian gods. And in the Vedic pantheon, you have their analog in terms of the Devas, led by Indra, and Indra is Zeus.
1074700	1076700	Okay, it's a very direct.
1077700	1096700	The Devas is Indra. And, you know, so the Olympian pantheon and the Vedic pantheon are very much, you know, the same, and they devolved from a primordial Indo European religion, a single primordial Indo European religion, we know this through linguistics and anthropology and
1096700	1112700	archaeology. Just, just the fact that Diaz-Pater shows up in Spain and Italy, and also all the way in India. There you go, you have a clear something to look at, you have tangible something to look at, that shows you this is a widespread ancient language that's spread across the entire
1113700	1133700	hemisphere. Yeah, he's a thunderbolt wielding skyfather warlord deity. That's Indra or Zeus. And he leads this pantheon. Okay. And there are these sacrificial priests who are orienting all of human worship toward this pantheon.
1133700	1150700	And humanity has this subservient, not to say servile relationship to these gods who are extremely tyrannical and capricious and frankly, at times sadistic. And this is true both in, you know, Greek religion and ancient Vedic religion.
1151700	1165700	And then there's another class of beings that you see both in Greek religion and Vedic religion, and those are the Titans and these Titans are opposed to the gods. The Vedic people called them ashuras.
1165700	1186700	And this is very significant because the chief deity of Zarathustra is Ahura Mazda. And Ahura, just like, you know, Gita and Gatha. Ahura is the Iranian cognate of the Vedic ashura. So Ahura Mazda, Mazda means wisdom.
1187700	1201700	Ahura Mazda is the Titan or the ashura of wisdom. So right away, what Zarathustra is doing is inverting the entire theological worldview of the Indo Europeans 180 degrees.
1202700	1216700	He preaches in the Gathas that the devas are sadistic, tyrannical, and above all deceptive. He says that their chief attribute is duruj, or the lie. They're great deceivers. And they're oppressors of mankind.
1217700	1233700	And above all, they're trying to deny us wisdom and knowledge. So we ought to align ourselves with Titanic wisdom and rebel against these gods. So it's a message of insurrection that we find in the Gathas.
1233700	1243700	Insurrection against the entire heavenly order, which was common to the Greeks and the Vedic people. Okay, so you can see why this guy had to flee for his life.
1243700	1245700	Right. Yeah.
1245700	1254700	Now, who would, who would have, if Ahura Mazda trans, what, what's, is there a God in the, in the ancient Greeks, Pantheon that relates to?
1254700	1256700	Hell yeah, there is. Hell yeah, there is.
1256700	1258700	I guess. Is it our nose?
1258700	1259700	No.
1259700	1260700	Okay.
1260700	1271700	But it's interesting because I'll say something about our nose later in, in a moment, you know, in response to this, but, okay, so let's lay this out really briefly for a minute.
1271700	1277700	And I'm going to come back to these attributes of Ahura Mazda momentarily, but just to answer your question.
1277700	1291700	First of all, we've got the name Titan of wisdom. Okay, who's a Titan who's associated with wisdom? Second, the chief attribute of Ahura Mazda is forward thinking or thinking ahead.
1292700	1301700	And I'll come back to this thinking, whoa, wait a minute, thinking ahead. And number three, what is the element that symbolizes cosmic order?
1301700	1307700	That's, that's an expression of the mind of Ahura Mazda fire and ever burning fire.
1307700	1308700	I got it.
1308700	1310700	Oh, okay. So who is Ahura Mazda?
1310700	1311700	Prometheus.
1311700	1312700	Yeah.
1312700	1330700	Okay. Clearly, Ahura Mazda is a philosophical concept that's been developed on the basis of an older Indo-European myth of Prometheus, which you find in its original form, not in Greece, but in Iran.
1330700	1332700	He's a creator too.
1332700	1338700	Yeah, and he's the creator. He's the creator of mankind. Okay. He created us in his image.
1338700	1345700	So to think for ourselves and not to worship these tyrannical Olympians, we'll come back to that.
1345700	1351700	But the myth of Prometheus, a lot of people might not realize doesn't come from Greece. It comes from Iran originally.
1351700	1360700	The whole Caucasus was part of Iran until the Russian Zars took it from Iran in the 1800s.
1360700	1362700	Wow, it's a long time.
1362700	1366700	Okay, so the Caucasus is the cradle of Iranian civilization.
1366700	1375700	And the myth of Prometheus in its original form is still found in the Caucasus in terms of the cult of Amirani.
1375700	1387700	There's this figure called Amirani, and he's clearly, if you look at the structure of the myth, he's Prometheus, and they still worship him in the folk religion of Georgia.
1387700	1393700	And there are statues of him in the countryside of Georgia in the Caucasus Mountains where, of course, Prometheus has changed.
1393700	1399700	In the myth, Prometheus, when he's punished by Zeus, he's changed from Caucasus Mountains.
1399700	1416700	So the whole ancient Indo-European fire cult of Prometheus, I believe, was the raw material with which Zarathustra was working when he developed this philosophically complex notion of Ahura Mazda.
1416700	1418700	That's fascinating.
1418700	1424700	But I mentioned forethought.
1424700	1436700	Ahura Mazda emanates seven powers or seven facets of his divine intelligence.
1436700	1443700	And these are called the Amesha Spentas, and the fact that it's seven is going to be relevant to our discussion of his Zarathustra's influence on Gnosticism.
1443700	1445700	Okay, so bear that in mind.
1445700	1455700	So they're the seven powers, and the foremost of these is Sepanto Minu, which, as I mentioned, is translated into Greek as Prometheus.
1455700	1457700	Forward thinking.
1457700	1458700	Thinking ahead.
1458700	1462700	The progressive mentality is one good translation of it.
1462700	1467700	Sepanto, progressive, forward-oriented, Minu mentality, mind.
1467700	1468700	Sepanto Minu.
1468700	1478700	And this is the foremost of the seven powers that express, you know, Ahura Mazda in the cosmos.
1478700	1490700	The second one is something called Asha Vahishta, and Asha became Artha in the language of the Persian Empire, and this means cosmic order.
1491700	1498700	It's basically the Greek notion cosmos, which, by the way, had not been formed yet at that time. It's going to be formed as we'll discuss in Heraclitus.
1498700	1507700	So this notion of cosmic order is the second manifestation of this of Ahura Mazda, Asha Vahishta.
1507700	1509700	It means the best order, literally.
1509700	1510700	That's the translation of it.
1510700	1514700	Asha order, Vahishta the best, namely cosmic order.
1514700	1520700	And we've got, and that, and very significantly, let me not gloss over the fact that Asha Vahishta symbolized by fire.
1520700	1525700	That's the ever-burning fire, which always changes its forms, but it's the same substrate.
1525700	1527700	In other words, energy.
1527700	1531700	Energy, the cosmos is basically its ever-transforming energy.
1531700	1537700	Is this that monad that people attribute to his teachings?
1537700	1539700	We'll get into that.
1539700	1546700	I think that, in my view, Zarathustra is neither a monist nor a dualist.
1546700	1548700	His view is more nuanced than that.
1548700	1561700	But I think that his view influenced both monism and it influenced both the Valentinian type of Gnosticism and also the Manichaean dualistic type of Gnosticism.
1561700	1571700	Okay, so then the third one after Asha Vahishta, we could say, is Vohumana.
1571700	1576700	And Vohumana means the best thinking, the best thinking.
1576700	1584700	And notice, humana in Vohumana becomes humanitas.
1584700	1588700	Vohumana, the best thinking, is the means whereby we become truly human.
1588700	1592700	Unless you cultivate Vohumana, you're not really a human being.
1592700	1595700	You're an animal that walks on two legs.
1595700	1610700	Okay, so this notion that became prominent in the Roman Empire of humanitas being something that is not necessarily inherent, shouldn't be taken for granted, but something that has to be cultivated.
1610700	1622700	And this is a notion that goes back to Zarathustra's concept of Vohumana, one of the seven Amesha Spentas or emanations of Ahura Mazda.
1622700	1626700	Then we've got Haurava Tath.
1626700	1630700	And so, okay, there's a certain internal logic to this.
1630700	1639700	When you cultivate Vohumana or the best thinking, you are aligning yourself with Asha Vahishta, with cosmic order.
1639700	1654700	And when you align yourself with Asha, with cosmic order through the best thinking, then you also wind up becoming a vehicle or channel for the progressive force in the cosmos.
1654700	1656700	Namely, sepan taminu.
1656700	1664700	This progressive mentality starts to become the dominant spirit of your life as you align yourself with cosmic order through the best thinking.
1664700	1668700	That's how sepan taminu, Asha Vahishta and Vohumana are connected.
1668700	1683700	And then, when you start to come into this alignment through the cultivation of your human potential for rationality and intellect, then you attain a series of other attributes.
1683700	1688700	One of them is Haurava Tath, which means wholeness.
1689700	1695700	Wholeness in the sense that the word health used to mean to be hail or whole.
1695700	1709700	And this kind of wholeness was symbolized by water in early Zoroastrianism, which I think is where the baptism idea comes from in Christianity.
1709700	1715700	This baptism, submersion and water as a symbol of conferring wholeness upon a person.
1715700	1729700	Another attribute that follows from cultivating the best thinking is Ameratot, which is often translated as immortality and people connect this to like the Taoist notion of longevity.
1729700	1734700	But actually the word Ameratot means deathlessness.
1735700	1745700	Ameratot, mer, mer is like a cognate of, you know, mocht in French, or you know, it's our word for mortality.
1745700	1754700	You can see how Ameratot mortality, right? So it's Ameratot, immortality, deathlessness.
1754700	1755700	Immortal.
1755700	1759700	Immortal, right? But okay, but it could just mean like vitality.
1759700	1760700	Right.
1760700	1765700	Coming from out of the power and grip of death and being very vital.
1765700	1769700	So vitality and wholeness coming from cultivating the best thinking.
1769700	1775700	And then this is where you get the idea of apotheosis later on in these Gnostics.
1775700	1777700	Makes sense.
1777700	1790700	And then you have spent Armaiti, which is tranquility, serenity, poise, kind of, you know, deep grace and groundedness.
1790700	1804700	And whereas Ameratot is symbolized by vegetation, spent Armaiti is symbolized by the earth, the element of earth, so grounded serenity and tranquility coming from being well rooted
1804700	1813700	through, you know, the cultivation of the best thinking and the wholeness or health and vitality that comes from it.
1813700	1822700	And then finally, Vohul Khashatra is the last of these seven attributes or emanations of Ahura Mazda.
1822700	1831700	And that means the best dominion or the ideal governance or, you know, the most righteous form of rule.
1831700	1846700	And so this is another thing which if you, you know, if we can keep it in mind to come back to is important in terms of teasing out the distinctions between Zarathustra teaching and the various forms of Gnosticism that were deeply influenced by it,
1846700	1850700	because in Gnosticism, you know, we can flesh this out later.
1850700	1860700	There is this inherent critique of power where all powers are contic and, you know, generally all political regimes are inherently bound for corruption so forth.
1860700	1864700	Not so in Zarathustra's vision in Zarathustra, Zarathustra is the first utopian.
1864700	1874700	And he believes that there can be an ideal form of government based on the governance of the wise from which Plato later gets his idea of the philosopher kings and so on and so forth.
1874700	1879700	These are the seven major attributes of, you know, the teachings of Zarathustra.
1879700	1888700	But, but, you know, there's other points I want to get to that we find in the gothers as well but just if you want to have any reflections and commentary on that before we continue.
1888700	1891700	Oh, let's see. So yeah, so.
1891700	1904700	Okay, so he's spreading these ideas and let's how do we get from that to having like separate different types forms of Gnosticism that spread as far as Greece like how do these ideas get fleshed out.
1904700	1917700	Yeah, okay, before, okay, so before we head to the influence on, and this is, let me just lay out a few other important points, okay, because they're going to be vital to the impact of Zarathustra's thinking on Gnosticism.
1917700	1928700	One is that there's a counterforce to, I was about to say to Ahura Mazda, because this is how the Gnostics interpret this counterforce.
1928700	1941700	And really it's a counterforce to Sepanto Minu, to this, you know, the seventh power or, you know, the main attribute of Ahura Mazda, and that counterforce is called Angra Minu.
1941700	1948700	So you have Sepanto Minu and Angra Minu, and this Angra Minu is later contracted linguistically to Ahriman.
1948700	1949700	Right.
1949700	1959700	Angra Minu literally means the constricted constrained mentality and Gira Gira in Persian means nodded up, like nodded up, like, you know.
1959700	1965700	And for anyone that wants, anyone doesn't, this influences Christianity big time with the devil.
1965700	1972700	And there's a passage in Matthew where Jesus is in the wilderness, and he's being tempted by the devil.
1972700	1985700	And I'm not even kidding, if you look at the Zendavesta, the passage lines up almost verbatim, where it's the same thing you have Zarathustra in the wilderness chanting, doing his thing.
1985700	1991700	And then all of a sudden, Sepanto Minu comes out and he's like, Hey, if you worship me, I'll give you the boon to rule the all.
1991700	1993700	Angra Minu, Angra Minu.
1993700	1996700	Yeah, yeah, he goes, I'll give you the boon to rule all the nations.
1996700	2003700	And of course, Zarathustra just keeps chanting to Ohora Mazda and Angra Minu is rushed away, pushed off.
2003700	2010700	This is the story really influences how Jesus is portrayed in Matthew.
2010700	2020700	And by the way, this just happens to be the same book that starts off with Magi chasing a star for to find like there can't be a coincidence.
2020700	2024700	This is a highly, I think people think Matthew is a Jewish book.
2024700	2029700	I mean, I think it's just Eastern book. I guess that makes more sense, right?
2029700	2039700	There's a lot that could be said about all of that. Yeah, I'll try to come back to it, in particular to the devil. Okay, because the devil's in the details.
2039700	2045700	Anyway, so, so Angra Minu, right, what is this Angra Minu?
2045700	2067700	Angra Minu, right, get a constrained constricted. This is the force or counter force that is constraining progress is suffocating life is constricting our flourishing right so it's a force of
2068700	2075700	stagnation and stasis and retardation, actually. Okay.
2075700	2087700	And so one important thing about this Angra Minu notion that becomes Arriman in Middle Persian is that it means Ahura Mazda is not omnipotent.
2087700	2100700	Okay, he's neither omnipotent nor omniscient. And this is really important because many theologians have recognized and on account of this fact Zoroastrianism doesn't face the problem of evil.
2100700	2115700	In any religion where you have an omniscient and omnipotent God, you know, there's a problem of God being responsible for all the evil in the world. And if in my view, more importantly, you know, the fact that you don't have any free will you cannot have free will and have an omnipotent and omniscient God it doesn't work.
2115700	2123700	Okay, it's completely illogical. And any jackass like St. Augustine who wants to say that it's a miracle. I'm not going to give him the time of day. All right.
2123700	2131700	So you got to choose between your omniscient God omnipotent God on the one hand and free will on the others. Arathustra doesn't face that problem.
2131700	2148700	Aura Mazda is limited, the power and even the, you know, knowledge of Aura Mazda is limited by this counter force. And this means we have free will we have the free will radically to choose between these two forces and which one we want to align ourselves with.
2148700	2155700	And that's a message you find at the core of the dafas that Arathustra repeatedly says and emphatically so.
2155700	2159700	You with your own intellect.
2159700	2174700	Observe discern and choose which of the forces you want to align yourself with, either sepantaminu or angraminu. And to go back to the beginning of our discussion, the devas are aligned with Angraminu.
2174700	2185700	Okay. So, and he specifically says this in the gaffas, there is this very strange passage in the gaffas, which if you ask me aligns with the myth of Atlantis that you find in Plato.
2185700	2194700	And, you know, with some things in the in the Vedic context in terms of the Mahabharata's accounts of the ancient wars between the devas and the ashura's and so forth.
2194700	2209700	And there's a strange passage in the gaffas where as Arathustra says that when the devas were deliberating Angraminu came in, and he as a great deceiver confused their deliberations and they rushed in wrath and destroyed the life of mankind.
2209700	2218700	Well, what is this talking about this is talking about when Zeus calls a convocation of the Olympians and they decide to destroy the world through a great, great deluge.
2218700	2225700	And in particular, they're targeting the Atlanteans who have rebelled against Olympus.
2225700	2229700	So the devas, the gods are aligned with Angraminu or Ahrema.
2229700	2240700	And we have the free choice to be able to basically resist these heavenly powers that notice now the Gnostic structure is already becoming clear.
2240700	2246700	These heavenly powers that stand between us and the true divine intelligence of the cosmos.
2247700	2248700	Archons.
2248700	2249700	Yeah.
2249700	2250700	Yeah.
2250700	2252700	So the devas are the Archons.
2252700	2253700	Wow.
2253700	2255700	Zarathustra's take on the devas or devs.
2255700	2259700	It's where we get the word devil from devs, right?
2259700	2264700	The devas, they are the Archons.
2264700	2273700	They're the prototype for the Gnostic Archons who stand between us and our alignment with the divine intelligence, you know, in the cosmos.
2273700	2275700	Wow.
2276700	2283700	The more you talk about it, the more it's starting to look a lot clearer of how these ideas line up.
2283700	2289700	One last very important piece of the message of the Gapas that's going to become fundamental to Gnosticism.
2289700	2293700	And that's the idea that, well, two more.
2293700	2304700	One is that this choice, this free choice that we have has to be exercised within a certain timeframe.
2304700	2310700	Zarathustra is the first person in recorded history to have a teleological conception of time.
2310700	2316700	So all of these ancient cultures, the Greek culture, the Vedic culture, the Mayan culture, I mean ancient Egyptian, etc.
2316700	2327700	Everywhere across the entire globe, you had cyclical conceptions of time where there were a series of world ages that you'd go through from the Golden Age, the Silver Age, the Bronze Age, etc.
2328700	2335700	Iron Age, or the Greek, you know, Satya Yuga, all the way to the Kali Yuga, and then the cycle would repeat itself, right?
2335700	2338700	Zarathustra says no.
2338700	2352700	There is a successive series of world ages that are in a progressive trajectory toward an end of history that's an apocalypse.
2352700	2356700	And this end of history is a final judgment.
2356700	2369700	The forces of wisdom and the forces of ignorance and retardation between the forward momentum of creation and regression retardation and basically the power of death.
2369700	2374700	And so we have to make our choice before this final event.
2374700	2380700	And this final event is symbolized by the entire globe being engulfed in flame.
2380700	2385700	Okay, the world being set ablaze, which is an alchemical metaphor.
2385700	2391700	Right, it's the alchemical fire transmuting this world into a more perfect form.
2391700	2393700	And they call this the Fresh Guard.
2393700	2398700	And, well, this is what Zarathustra calls it in the Gaphas in its original form.
2398700	2402700	Fresh O'Keretti and it becomes Fresh Guard in Middle Persian.
2402700	2408700	Literally, if you can hear the word fresh in that Fresh Guard, Fresh O'Keretti, fresh.
2408700	2413700	So it's the refreshing of the world. It's like hitting the refresh button on a browser, right?
2413700	2415700	It's the refreshing of the world.
2415700	2419700	And it's accomplished through this alchemical fire.
2419700	2425700	And on the other side of that, everything attains its perfect form.
2425700	2431700	So this brings us then to the last idea, which is key to Gnosticism.
2431700	2443700	And that's that we have, there are these Farvahas or Fravashis that are the perfect forms of everything in the world.
2443700	2446700	And they pre-exist the created world.
2446700	2449700	No, no, no, notice, we're like 200 years before Plato here.
2449700	2450700	Okay.
2450700	2458700	So this idea that as I'm going to point to, if we have the time, Plato gets via Pythagoras from Zarathustra.
2458700	2471700	This idea of the archetypes pre-existing physical creation on the basis of them is also central to the message of Zarathustra.
2471700	2487700	And it becomes key to Gnosticism. This is the notion of the Pluroma or the, you know, some aetheric, whatever, non-physical realm where there are more perfect forms of beings in this world.
2487700	2494700	So the Pluroma notion in its, in its, you know, embryonic form is there in the Gaphas of Zarathustra.
2494700	2509700	And there's an idea that after the Fraschgaard, after this fiery, you know, apocalypse, this world, this physical world is going to more perfectly instantiate or embody this archetypal reality.
2509700	2514700	And in particular, in terms of our human existence,
2514700	2521700	each person who passes that trial by fire will embody his Dana.
2521700	2529700	Dana is a word that Zarathustra uses, which is a cognate of the Greek dianoia.
2529700	2534700	And it becomes the basis for two words in later Persian.
2535700	2542700	Dana, which means knowing, and Dane, which means duty. So think knowing and duty.
2542700	2546700	So the word Dana meant conscience in the teaching of Zarathustra.
2546700	2551700	And it was symbolized by a maiden who you would meet after death.
2551700	2559700	And this maiden, like a Valkyrie, right? This maiden was your perfect form, your, your anima, you know.
2559700	2562700	Is this where Diana comes from? The goddess?
2562700	2565700	I think so. And I'll tell you why in a moment.
2565700	2570700	Well, I'll tell you why, why right now. Okay, because who is Diana? Diana is the Roman form of Artemis.
2570700	2580700	Artemis has no meaning in Greek. We know, you know, Herodotus and other Greek writers say that the cult of Artemis was the religion of the Amazons.
2580700	2586700	And they're the ones who brought it to Greece. The Amazons built the temple of Artemis. The Amazons are Iranians.
2586700	2592700	The Amazons are Sarmatians. They're Sarmatian women. And they had a matriarchal society.
2592700	2597700	And so we have to look for the meaning of Artemis in Iranian languages, not in Greek.
2597700	2602700	And Artemis has a very clear meaning in Iranian languages. It's Arta, Amesha.
2602700	2614700	As I mentioned earlier, Arta is a Persian form of Asha, cosmic order, or truth. Truth is another translation of Asha or Arta.
2614700	2626700	And then Amesha, like I can remember, the Amesha spentas. The Amesha spentas, the seven emanations of Zaratus, of Armasda.
2626700	2637700	Amesha means undying or immortal. And Spenta is the sort of like the spirits, right? The immortal spirits.
2637700	2648700	So Arta, Amesha, Artemis. Arta, Amesha means immortal truth or immortal cosmic order.
2648700	2658700	And this is who Artemis really is. She's an embodiment of immortal cosmic order in a feminine form coming from out of a matriarchal Iranian society.
2658700	2664700	So do I think Diana is related to Dana? Yeah, I do think it's, you know, via Artemis.
2664700	2670700	Oh, true, yeah. I think you just laid it out perfectly. I don't think you can even deny it.
2670700	2680700	The chief attribute of, I don't know, attribute is not necessarily the right word, but look, she's known as a huntress who's associated with archery in particular.
2680700	2682700	The oldest myth in the world is the wild hunt.
2682700	2686700	The Iranians were known as the greatest archers of the ancient world.
2686700	2694700	Matata says the Iranians taught their kids three things. One, telling the truth to horseback riding in three archery.
2694700	2699700	Right. Okay, speak the truth and shoot well with arrows. That is Persian virtue, quote unquote.
2699700	2713700	And even Alexander the Great, if you read Arian, when he, when, before he even went to Persia in the East, he, he battled with the Skithians and he recruited thousands of their archers to even go to Persia.
2713700	2716700	And he probably couldn't even do that unless he did that first.
2716700	2722700	Yeah, they were the greatest ballistics people in the ancient world, the Iranians in general, Skithians and Persians both.
2722700	2723700	Yeah.
2723700	2730700	So, so anyway, yes, so you got this Dana. She's like this Valkyrie, who's your most perfect form.
2730700	2736700	And after, and also her word, her name becomes the word for knowledge in Persian later, Donna.
2736700	2739700	And so this is Sophia. It's your inner Sophia.
2739700	2740700	Wow.
2740700	2746700	Okay, and you're supposed to become her after the end of history, after the apocalypse.
2746700	2764700	We become, which is kind of bizarre because this is like some, it's very strange, it's an uber matriarchal conception, because it's saying that both men and women have this inner feminine, perfect form and that after the end of the world, like we're all going to embody that.
2764700	2765700	Yeah.
2765700	2775700	The old story too, Proverbs, Proverbs eight where it talks about Sophia first formed father totally switches that everything on his head like Adam is created by a female now like which one is it.
2775700	2789700	But I think that's how you get these middle or these medieval cobalists that that's what they're interpreting later on. But anyway, that's a whole different story. But yeah, I'm basically saying this is reflective in other parts of theology and philosophy.
2789700	2803700	Yeah, and and it's the it's the last what becomes the Gnostic destruction of the fallen world, and the emergence of the pluroma as our primary form of existence, and our embodying Sophia at the end of history.
2803700	2809700	It's all right there already in the gathas and you know, 580 BC.
2809700	2824700	Okay, so that lays out for us that the basic message of the gathas and now we can finally address this question that you raised, or maybe you want to raise in you about the influence of Zarathustra or Zoroaster on and by the way let me just mention this guy's name like what
2824700	2828700	is this, why some people call him Zoroaster.
2828700	2835700	Why is he called Zarathustra in. Yeah, that's a good question.
2835700	2853700	I assume the Greeks came up with this Zoroaster as a corruption of Zarathustra, because Zoroaster means Zara, or Zara in Persian means gold, and Aster, of course, is the word for star.
2853700	2870700	Zarathustra still means star in Persian. And so Zoroaster means golden star, but this is probably a corruption, because Zarathustra calls himself Zarathustra in the gathas and you know that's the Holy Iranian tradition refers to him is that
2870700	2886700	when Iranology becomes sophisticated in Europe in the 1800s, 1700s, 1800s, you know, you have the correct name Zarathustra reemerge and that's why Nietzsche uses the correct name of Zarathustra rather than Zoroaster, and Zarathustra means
2886700	2905700	golden star, but golden camel, ushtara is camel, later becomes the word ushtara, or ushtara in Persian means camel, so his name meant golden camel, and back in that time when he was alive, the two most prized animals were horses and
2905700	2921700	animals, and you found a lot of people with an ending name ending aspa, like Zarathustra's own friend Jam aspa, the king that became his patron, Visht aspa, aspa means horse, and ushtara means camel, so you had people named so and so camel or so and so horse.
2921700	2923700	And so his name means golden camel.
2923700	2933700	That's interesting, because I'm learning Greek right now, and my Greek teacher was just telling me that every time you see the str in a word, this comes from a family.
2933700	2941700	It's a certain family of linguistic words that have like a root somewhere, and it's like real deep in mythology, I guess.
2941700	2952700	But also as far as the camels go, you could see why camels would be so valuable because you can put tons of items on their back and travel long distances without having to carry it.
2952700	2954700	Like traders needed camels.
2954700	2960700	That's right. That's right. And of course, in this case, we're talking not about because your viewers are going to think Iran, whatever, Middle East.
2960700	2964700	No, we're not talking about Arabian camels here. We're talking about the Central Asian camel.
2964700	2965700	Right.
2965700	2971700	Zarathustra was living up towards Central Asia. So we're talking about the Central Asian camel. In any case, that's irrelevant.
2971700	2976700	So the influence of Zarathustra.
2976700	2980700	So Pythagoras, okay.
2980700	2983700	Look, Pythagoras is the first philosopher.
2983700	2985700	He's like the Abraham of the Greeks.
2985700	2990700	Well, God's forbid, God's forbid that we should ever compare him to Abraham.
2990700	2994700	Look, this is even from a Gnostic perspective, utter heresy, right?
2994700	2995700	Okay.
2995700	3002700	Abraham was a child murdering, you know, mindless zombie listening to a psychopathic voice from heaven.
3002700	3006700	And Pythagoras was a torchbearer of wisdom and enlightenment for humanity.
3006700	3011700	But I take your point, meaning like he's the forerunner of the entire
3011700	3013700	tradition in Greece.
3013700	3020700	Because nobody used the word philosophy before Pythagoras or the word philosopher, he's the one who coins the term.
3020700	3029700	And where is the word philosopher or philosophy didn't exist in Greek, it did in ancient Iranian.
3029700	3033700	Zarathustra wasn't a Zoroastrian.
3033700	3036700	And he didn't call his doctrine Zoroastrianism.
3036700	3041700	He called it Mazda Yasna, which means reverence for wisdom.
3041700	3045700	And a person following it was a Mazda Yasna, a reverer of wisdom.
3045700	3052700	And in particular, in the teaching of Zarathustra, you do not worship Ahura Mazda.
3052700	3055700	You are a friend of Ahura Mazda.
3055700	3057700	That's the term that he uses.
3057700	3066700	He used to be a friend of Ahura Mazda and the relationship to the wisdom, the Titanic wisdom is a relationship of friendship.
3066700	3072700	So philo Sophia philia means friendship in Greek and Sophia means wisdom.
3072700	3081700	So Pythagoras is just translating Mazda Yasna into Greek when he coins the term philosophy or the term philosopher.
3081700	3089700	And we know this is the case because the man spent a decade, more than a decade in the capital of the Persian Empire.
3089700	3092700	When Pythagoras was young, he went to Egypt.
3092700	3102700	And while he was in Egypt, studying with the priests and measuring the pyramid measure measuring the inside of the king's chamber to get the Pythagorean theorem and so on and so forth.
3102700	3109700	He was arrested by the military forces of Cambyses II.
3109700	3111700	Cambyses II was the son of Cyrus the Great.
3111700	3114700	He was the second emperor of the Persian Empire.
3114700	3126700	And as a joke, he had Pythagoras arrested the way that in Plato's Republic, there's the scene at the beginning where Socrates is arrested by his friends.
3126700	3130700	In other words, they forced him to come and have a philosophical discussion.
3130700	3134700	They're like, we're not going to let you go, man, you're going to come and you're going to talk to us.
3134700	3137700	We're going to get some, we're going to pick your brains and get some wisdom out of your head.
3137700	3138700	Like what I'm doing with you right now.
3138700	3141700	Well, maybe in any case.
3141700	3146700	So they grabbed this guy and they say that, listen, the king really wants to talk to you.
3146700	3152700	Please come back with us, whether you want it or not, you're coming back with us to Babylon, to the capital of the Persian Empire.
3152700	3158700	And, you know, we want you to sit with the magi and the king and, you know, talk to us.
3158700	3165700	And so he goes back with them and he spends 10 to 12 years.
3165700	3166700	That's what I've heard.
3166700	3167700	Yeah.
3167700	3177700	Over a decade studying with, and I think probably to some extent it was, you know, you know, two-way relationship, working with the magi.
3177700	3182700	Okay, the Zoroastrian priests in the capital of the Persian Empire, a dozen years.
3182700	3192700	Now, I'm not sure if you know about this, but among the stuff that's found from Marcus Aurelius in his writings, he's got Greek translations of Zoroaster.
3192700	3197700	And I'm wondering if this is, maybe through Pythagoras somehow it gets passed down.
3197700	3198700	Yeah.
3198700	3199700	Yeah.
3199700	3207700	I'm sure these writings were common both in the Pythagorean schools and also in the Platonic Academy, ultimately.
3207700	3217700	And the reason they didn't get to us is because of the burning of the library of Alexandria and Corinth and various other places, you know, where these libraries were torched.
3217700	3224700	So, so look, and by the way, let me just, this is not a side note.
3224700	3226700	This is actually really relevant.
3226700	3241700	One way we know that's true, and I'm just not making some anti-Christian claim like, you know, off the top of my head or what are pulling it out of somewhere is because we know there was this guy and a carcass of Scythia, who was another one living around
3241700	3246700	the time of Zarathustra between Zarathustra and Pythagoras.
3246700	3258700	And he was a Scythian by paternal descent, whose mother was Greek, and he went from Scythia, in other words, from Northern Iran to Athens, where he became friends with Solon.
3258700	3269700	And he was also known as one of the most, in fact, besides Zarathustra, and a carcass is the first pre-Socratic philosopher.
3269700	3273700	And he had a notorious reputation, this guy did.
3273700	3282700	He was basically a philosophical anarchist, and we can come back to this, you know, a lot of what becomes the teaching of Gautama Buddha, I think is deeply influenced by Anacarsus of Scythia.
3282700	3301700	A lot of what becomes Taoism, deeply influenced by Anacarsus of Scythia's deconstruction of polar opposites and his critique of emergent rationality, and his own notion of basically, you know, nature as a flux and the dynamic interplay of opposites,
3301700	3310700	and the lack of any objective criteria for making judgments about things. He was like a proto-Synic in a lot of ways.
3310700	3311700	Wow.
3311700	3321700	And, okay, and he was Iranian. All right, he's coming from the same cultural milieu as Zarathustra. But here's the thing. There are no writings of his that have survived.
3321700	3327700	This guy wrote a shit ton. People quoted him in various books, and we don't have anything from Anacarsus of Scythia.
3327700	3329700	So therefore, go ahead.
3329700	3331700	Is that what he met Solon, the lawgiver?
3331700	3339700	He was friends with him. He was personal friends with him. Solon said, he came and he said to Solon, hey, you know, I came here to be your friend.
3339700	3345700	You know, I think we could really, you know, have a profitable relationship. Solon said to him, you know, it's best to make friends at home.
3345700	3352700	I mean, get lost, man. You're some foreigner, you know, get the hell out of here. And he said, well, you know, since you're at home, you should make friends with me.
3352700	3355700	And anyway, the two of them struck up. Yeah, in Athens, yeah.
3355700	3356700	Okay, okay.
3356700	3358700	He moved to Athens. He was an Iranian who moved to Athens.
3358700	3364700	Because there is a story that Solon goes to Heliopolis, because that was where the Great Library was before Alexandria.
3364700	3365700	Yeah.
3365700	3366700	And so this is after that?
3366700	3372700	I'm not sure when in Solon's life it was, whether it was before he went to Egypt or after he went to Egypt or at what point.
3372700	3374700	But that's still fascinating that he has it.
3374700	3386700	Well, actually, I can tell you, it was in 589 BC. So people familiar with the life of Solon, they can figure out whether it was before or after he went to Egypt.
3386700	3387700	Leave it in the comments.
3387700	3388700	There you go.
3388700	3389700	Yeah.
3389700	3402700	But just notice the date here. Anacarsis came to Athens in 589 BC. When was the likely date that Zarathustra composed the Gathas? 580 BC. So this is within nine years.
3402700	3404700	Wow, so now we can start pinpointing when things happen now.
3404700	3405700	Exactly.
3405700	3414700	So this is, you know, it makes a lot of sense Zarathustra would have been at this time, and would have been a major catalytic force for the rise of pre-Socratic philosophy.
3414700	3429700	In any case, why did I bring up Anacarsis? Yeah, it's obvious we lost a lot of these writings and that there were definitely texts by Zarathustra other than the Gathas and other, I hesitate to call them Zoroastrian texts, texts of Mazda,
3429700	3439700	Yassna, Iranian wisdom, translated into Greek, which were in these libraries and which we lost through the catastrophic rise of the Catholic Church and so forth.
3439700	3442700	But in any case, okay, we got sidetracked, Pythagoras.
3442700	3443700	Yeah.
3444700	3452700	So he studies for a dozen years in the capital of the Persian Empire with the Magi, the priests who have adopted the doctrine of Zarathustra.
3452700	3458700	So obviously this guy, he's got to have been under massive influence from the teaching of Zarathustra.
3458700	3462700	And you can see it reflected in Pythagoras' teaching.
3463700	3471700	He has this notion of Peras and Aperon, that there are these two principles that work in the cosmos. One is a principle of order.
3471700	3475700	This is what, you know, when he says everything is number, right?
3475700	3482700	Pythagoras is saying there is this principle of limit and limitation and demarcation, Peras.
3482700	3490700	And what it is demarcating and limiting is Aperon, a chaotic unlimited, okay, and this chaotic unlimited is like a,
3490700	3496700	it's like a vortex, it's like a black hole, like, you know, the event horizon of a black hole tears everything apart, right?
3496700	3501700	So this is like Angaraminu, this is like the force of chaos and disorder.
3501700	3506700	So you see this at the heart of the ontology of Pythagoras.
3506700	3515700	You also see that Pythagoras, and I neglected to mention this earlier in terms of Zarathustra, but I'm coming back to it now.
3515700	3529700	Pythagoras has a exceptional respect for women and a, you know, a promotion of the bizarre notion at the time of radically countercultural notion that women should have a quality of opportunity.
3529700	3536700	He took women as students into the Pythagorean school and some of them rose to be teachers in the Pythagorean order.
3536700	3540700	And this is something you find in the Gathas of Zarathustra as well.
3540700	3551700	Zarathustra, I mean, this is unheard. In 600 BC, this guy is talking about the equality of women and how women have conscience and rationality and should make their own choices in life.
3551700	3558700	And he officiates at his daughter's wedding and like gives this whole sermon about how her life is her own and she should make her own choices and so on and so forth.
3558700	3563700	This could possibly be from this Dana idea from Zarathustra.
3563700	3566700	Yeah, and let's not forget.
3566700	3578700	A whole third of the Iranian community and those are a fourth of the Iranian community in those days, the Sarmatians, were in matriarchal society who became the basis for the Amazon myths among the Greeks.
3578700	3581700	That's a really good point. This is all coming together now.
3581700	3587700	And plus the Greeks used to say about the Persians, that the Persians were.
3587700	3600700	They used to say there were pansies and cucks who were like under the thumb of their women. And they're you know at the Persian court and the you know women called all the shots and so on so forth and
3600700	3609700	because the Greeks were extremely patriarchal, you know paternalistic people, but yeah in the ancient Persian military you had female admirals in the Persian Navy.
3609700	3611700	Okay, so.
3611700	3618700	All right, so Pythagoras is also getting this from the teaching of Zarathustra the place that women have in the Pythagorean order.
3618700	3635700	And his notions of justice and of how governments should be run are clearly based on Zarathustra's idea of the best governance or the most righteous form of regime, which is the rule of philosophers.
3635700	3646700	Okay, the, the system that he was setting up in real life with Kavi Vishtaspa his patron where basically he was a court philosopher determining court policy.
3646700	3662700	And so this is an idea that Pythagoras is getting from Zarathustra and that then Plato as a member of the Pythagorean order adopts and articulates in Republic as I was about to say philosopher kingship but really it should be called
3662700	3668700	philosopher guardianship because women can be philosopher rulers as well.
3668700	3687700	So, you find all these ideas, you know, in the teachings of Pythagoras that are and then of course you know, when we talk about archetypes right, as I mentioned earlier, the whole notion of archetypes that you find at the core of platonic ontology comes from the Pythagorean order.
3687700	3692700	Plato is getting that through his membership in this secret society.
3692700	3700700	And Pythagoras is getting that from Zarathustra via the magi that he's studying with for a dozen years in the capital of the Persian Empire.
3700700	3713700	Now it's also noteworthy that Pythagoras only leaves Iran and goes and let's remember okay Babylon. Okay, it's in Iraq today. Iraq is a fake country.
3713700	3726700	It was created by the British colonialists. It's a fake country. The capital of Iran was in Iraq for for Iranian empires, the capital, not only was Iraq part of Iran.
3726700	3738700	It was the capital district okay so this Mesopotamia has spent the better part of the past 2500 years as part of Iran integral part of Iran.
3738700	3754700	It was the period where the Ottoman Turks overran it and ruled it for a while before the British carved Iraq anyway, point being that he only leaves Iran Pythagoras does when the Persian Empire conquers his native island of Samos.
3754700	3755700	Right.
3755700	3758700	And he goes to Italy and sets up in proton Italy.
3758700	3772700	So how come how come Pythagoras only leaves Iran when Iran conquers Samos. If you are some nationalist Greek, right, you would hate the Persians for conquering your homeland.
3772700	3780700	No, this guy only leaves Iran and goes back to his homeland once it's under Iranian rule. Okay, so he's clearly aligned.
3780700	3787700	Right. And then he got and we're going to talk about her Heraclitus to and, you know, his politics and how that was aligned with the Persian Empire.
3787700	3797700	But he goes from Samos as you mentioned to Italy and he sets up the Pythagorean schools in southern Italy. Well, if you ask me what this looks like is he was sent on a mission.
3797700	3808700	The major I sent him I said, okay, go now. He was an evangelist basically go now and preach this doctrine in the West, spread this wisdom in the West.
3808700	3819700	And he sets up these schools in Italy, which then are burned down by the local, you know, feudal aristocracy because these guys don't want their women in school.
3819700	3827700	They don't want, you know, their women becoming a, you know, uppity and talking back and not being good housewives who can, you know, be in the kitchen and so on and so on and so forth.
3827700	3830700	Yeah, they were like a warrior, warrior cults back over there.
3830700	3843700	Yeah, the Pythagoras tried to basically seize control of the government of southern Italy. He had basically all these politicians he was training to carry out a coup d'etat and create a philosopher kingship in southern Italy.
3843700	3853700	And the local landed aristocracy became wise to this, and they burned down the Pythagorean schools but of course the school spread. And then we had important initiates of the schools.
3853700	3864700	Most notably Plato. And so then this Zoroastrian influence gets passed on to play. Okay, so but Pythagoras is is an important figure here because why.
3864700	3875700	Who were the two people besides Jesus that the Carpacrations set up statues of play Pythagoras and Heraclitus.
3875700	3879700	Oh, I'm sorry Plato Pythagoras and Plato.
3879700	3893700	Who were the two major influences on Plato Pythagoras. So people think okay of Socrates when they think of Plato. All right, but I'm going to make a very long story short Socrates was a war veteran, who was a bum on the streets.
3893700	3898700	Socrates was like a Vietnam war vet bum.
3898700	3907700	Who was a real wise ass. That's the kind of person he was. Plato takes him and he turns him to this grand dramatic persona.
3907700	3921700	After the death of Socrates. So it's true that Socrates was important like for Plato when Plato was a teenager or very young man in his early 20s and whatever. He was an early mentor to him, but he was like a bum on the street who was
3921700	3928700	he also teaches people like Diogenes and you get the cynics that come out of him to exactly that's the type he is. Yeah.
3928700	3933700	But Socrates wasn't an important influence on Plato in terms of his thinking.
3933700	3942700	The doctrines that Plato puts in the mouth of Socrates are influenced by two figures in particular one is Pythagoras, because Plato went on to join the Pythagorean order.
3942700	3958700	After that he was a sworn brother of the order, which this could be a whole other program type about you know, the Illuminati in the beginning of the Illuminati and you know, who Plato really was and how much he left unsaid in his writings and so on and so forth his esoteric doctrine.
3958700	3959700	That's the next one.
3959700	3965700	The the other thing, the other major influence on Plato was Heraclitus. Right.
3965700	3976700	Aristotle tells us that in the period after the death of Socrates, and before Plato joined the Pythagorean order. Why are we going through all this because of the Carpacritians.
3976700	3981700	And they worship Plato together with Pythagoras and Jesus.
3981700	3993700	So Aristotle tells us that in that period after the death of Socrates and before Plato becomes a sworn member of the Pythagorean order, Plato studied under this Heraclitian teacher,
3994700	3999700	and Plato was a zealous Heraclitian.
3999700	4003700	He had completely internalized the worldview of Heraclitus.
4003700	4014700	And Aristotle says it's only on the basis of the Heraclitian worldview that Plato then builds up this ontology of an epistemology of forms.
4015700	4018700	The concepts, the Eidos and so on and so forth.
4018700	4032700	But the backdrop for Plato's sophisticated ontology and epistemology of forms is an acceptance of Heraclitus's view of the world as flux and various other notions of Heraclitus about the nature of cosmic justice and so forth.
4032700	4037700	So who are the two main influences on Plato, Heraclitus and Pythagoras.
4037700	4041700	Okay, we talked about Pythagoras's connection to Iran and Tzarathustra.
4041700	4043700	You demonstrated that.
4043700	4046700	Well, let's let's talk about Heraclitus.
4046700	4051700	A lot of people bring this up that Heraclitus is very Zoroastrian in his thinking.
4051700	4054700	So let's go through this.
4054700	4061700	Heraclitus has a number of ideas in his, we call it fragments.
4061700	4065700	It was a book that was called On Nature, and now only fragments are left.
4065700	4073700	There's a number of ideas in that text that have no precedent in Greek culture, but align directly with Zarathustra's teaching.
4073700	4085700	He criticizes all the Greeks, and they're like, he's very much like a Tupac of his day, like criticizing everyone else, but like, yeah, being like a sort of like going against the grain.
4085700	4087700	Look, he attacks Homer and he's...
4087700	4089700	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4090700	4094700	I mean, this would be the equivalent of being a Satanist in that time.
4094700	4097700	You're attacking, you're ripping the Bible to pieces.
4097700	4102700	Homer and Hesiod were the Bible of that time, and he's just trashing them.
4102700	4103700	Right.
4103700	4106700	Okay, and so, yeah.
4106700	4108700	Now, why is he trashing them?
4108700	4118700	Because very much in alignment with Zarathustra, Heraclitus is saying that these gods that these guys write about Homer and Hesiod, these Olympians,
4118700	4120700	these are not the true divinities.
4120700	4124700	The true divinity is a divine mind, okay?
4124700	4135700	It's a divine mind that expresses itself as cosmic order and that is best symbolized by an undying and ever-changing fire.
4136700	4139700	Smentaminu and Ashal Vahishta.
4139700	4149700	Okay, Smentaminu is the cosmic order and Ashal Vahishta is its being symbol, best symbolized by fire or energy ever-changing in its forms.
4149700	4160700	And another idea that you find there is that everything in nature advances, proceeds, unfolds according to dialectical opposition.
4160700	4172700	There is a struggle between dialectically opposed forces, forces that they are in tension with one another and their dynamic tension is creative or constructive.
4172700	4174700	And it's what moves the world forward.
4174700	4183700	Well, this is also at the core of the teaching of Zarathustra in that, and this is a very subtle and important point.
4183700	4186700	Angraminu is also necessary.
4186700	4188700	You don't want to get rid of Angraminu.
4188700	4191700	Angraminu or Ahriman is also necessary.
4191700	4196700	It's the struggle between Sementaminu and Angraminu that makes the world work.
4196700	4203700	It's like when a forest burns down, it comes back even greater and there's more life after that, sort of.
4203700	4205700	Yes, and it's also like a chess game.
4205700	4206700	Yeah.
4206700	4211700	Angraminu or the black pieces on the board.
4211700	4216700	And so the divine mind of Ahurama is the once an opponent.
4216700	4217700	Right.
4217700	4222700	And notice the ethos behind this mentality, right?
4222700	4232700	It's a very chivalric, noble-minded ethos which says, I want evil to go ahead and do its best.
4232700	4234700	I want an opponent.
4234700	4240700	It's the Olympics ethos of agonistic struggle that we find in the Greek Olympics.
4240700	4244700	You have to have that contrast to make that move.
4244700	4247700	And also, it's not just the contrast, it's what makes you your best.
4247700	4249700	You play your best game against the strong opponent.
4249700	4251700	Exactly.
4251700	4255700	But it takes a certain depth of soul to have that kind of ethos, right?
4255700	4260700	I mean, really niggardly, petty people want to just eliminate all opposition.
4260700	4272700	The strong and noble-minded person, a free spirit, wants to face the best opposition so that they can become the best version of themselves and find out what they're really capable of.
4272700	4279700	And so this is also a notion of Zarathustra that winds up at the heart of the teaching of Heraclitus.
4279700	4288700	And then there are these peculiar things in there that there's nowhere they could have come from, but from Zarathustra and Iranian culture.
4288700	4300700	Like, Heraclitus says, don't keep corpses around and engage in ceremonial rights around corpses.
4300700	4305700	He says, throw them out like dumb. Throw corpses out quicker than crap.
4305700	4307700	Literally, is what he puts in his thick.
4307700	4309700	That's literally what's written in Zen Vesta.
4309700	4310700	Exactly.
4310700	4315700	You can rip your nails off and throw that on the ground. That's got to be disposed in a certain way.
4315700	4327700	Zarastrians would take corpses immediately to the outskirts of the city, and they would put them on these rocky outcrops for vultures to descend on the corpses and basically to feed nature.
4327700	4331700	Because you don't need your body anymore at that point. Your spirit is gone on.
4331700	4336700	So they just take the corpses and they strip them down to the bone in these places and let vultures feed on them.
4336700	4341700	In any case, they throw them out from the populated area and Heraclitus says this in the fragments.
4341700	4345700	Well, this is totally anathema to traditional Greek funerary rights.
4345700	4348700	And there's only one place he could have gotten it from.
4348700	4356700	And then when we look at his politics, okay, it's just, it's just absolutely undeniably obvious.
4356700	4359700	And then we look at Heraclitus's politics.
4359700	4363700	He is vehemently opposed to democracy.
4363700	4374700	He believes that the wise should rule, and that the best men, meaning the ones with the most cultivated intellect should be the guardians of a society.
4374700	4384700	And so committed to this idea that when his personal friend, Hermodorus, the satrap, the Persian governor of Ephesus.
4384700	4391700	Okay, so Heraclitus's buddy was the Persian governor of Ephesus, a guy called Hermodorus.
4391700	4403700	And when this guy is overthrown in an Ephesian revolt against Persian rule, Heraclitus says of his fellow citizens, they should all be hanged to the last man.
4403700	4407700	And the city should be left to the children.
4407700	4413700	Yeah, and that's, by the way, this is in Turkey, so it's not like he's in Asia already.
4413700	4417700	He's in the Persian Empire. This is a part of Greece that was ruled by the Persian Empire.
4417700	4424700	His buddy, Hermodorus, is literally the Persian governor, the governor of the Persians appointed to rule Ephesus.
4424700	4440700	And when Hermodorus is deposed in an attempted coup by the Ephesians, an attempted Greek revolt against Persian rule, he says these Greeks here, these morons, these rabble, he calls them rabble, uneducated,
4440700	4453700	mass, unthinking herd of people who, in the name of democracy, revolted against Hermodorus, he says they should all be executed to the last man, leave the children to run the city.
4453700	4455700	And then, okay, so.
4455700	4459700	He was in the category of Thales, too. Thales was a monotheist, I'm not mistaken.
4459700	4473700	Yes. And then, in the midst of this situation, Darius, the Persian emperor, sends a letter to Heraclitus saying, come be the court philosopher of Iran.
4473700	4474700	Wow.
4474700	4487700	Darius the Great, in all of his inscriptions on mountain sides in Iran, on rock cliffs in Iran, prefaces his decrees with, in the name of Ahura Mazda, and of Arta.
4487700	4488700	Absolutely.
4488700	4489700	Absolutely.
4489700	4502700	He's a Zoroastrian monarch. He's legitimating himself through the teachings of Zarathustra. And he says to Heraclitus, come be the court philosopher of the Persian Empire.
4502700	4506700	Now, if you didn't think that this guy was Zoroastrian in his thinking.
4506700	4516700	No way he would be asked to be a court philosopher if he didn't already have a line thinking. To a high degree, too. Not just a little.
4516700	4517700	To a high degree.
4517700	4522700	If he didn't epitomize the worldview of the ancient Iranians.
4522700	4523700	Wow.
4523700	4529700	So, this is really telling. And then what does Heraclitus do? He writes him back.
4529700	4540700	And he basically says, thank you, but no thank you. I don't think court life would suit me. It's a little too luxurious for me. And I'm not going to abandon my post.
4540700	4541700	Yeah.
4541700	4552700	And, you know, you should come here. And so, instead, Heraclitus goes and he exiles himself to the temple of Artemis. He doesn't leave the temple for the rest of his life.
4552700	4561700	Because his attitude is basically, I hate these people. These are not my kinsmen. These people revolted against her, you know, her motorists who revolted against the Persians.
4561700	4569700	And he makes the temple of Artemis, again, Arta Amesha, immortal truth, this Iranian goddess figure, right?
4569700	4574700	He makes her temple his home for the rest of his life.
4574700	4583700	And this is where the fragments were, you know, kept. The first copy of the fragments were kept by the priestesses of the temple of Artemis.
4583700	4590700	And he would only come out to play with children on the steps of the temple. The children that, you know, parents would bring when they came to worship Artemis.
4590700	4594700	They would leave their children on the temple steps and Heraclitus would be out there playing games with these children.
4594700	4600700	I prefer to talk to them than to talk to any of you. I'll play with the children, thank you very much.
4600700	4613700	And so, so anyway, and by the way, there's this beautiful fragment where he says that the Aeon is a child at play, moving pieces in a game.
4613700	4627700	Sovereignty belongs to the child. And this is Heraclitus understanding what Zarathustra really was after in this opposition between Sepanto Minu and Angra Minu
4627700	4635700	as part of the divine intelligence of Ahura Mazda, where there is a cosmic game on like a chess game.
4635700	4645700	Or like backgammon, which is Iranian in origin. And the point is to play a good game and a creative game.
4645700	4658700	In any case, I think that Heraclitus did that. He maintained his post. He sequestered himself to the temple of Artemis because he was waiting for Darius to come to him, not the other way around.
4658700	4665700	In other words, he was saying to the Persian Empire, you come back and reassert rule here and in Greece in general.
4665700	4672700	And so in this person, very much like Pythagoras, we're dealing with an agent of the Persian Empire.
4672700	4685700	These were progressive minds that saw the Persian post, saw the rule of Darius and Cyrus as like a modern or an ancient rendition of what today is like the UN.
4685700	4696700	Like overarching, but also just fair, knowledgeable, intelligent and good for the world instead of having like warring states periods.
4696700	4699700	Yeah. I mean, the United Nations is so corrupt.
4700700	4702700	I'm just saying the idea.
4702700	4707700	You know what I think it's more like, I'll tell you what I think it's more like, it's like the United States at its foundation.
4707700	4710700	The Persian Empire, the United States, you know, Thomas Jefferson.
4710700	4712700	Washington.
4712700	4723700	Yeah, Thomas Jefferson was very deeply influenced by Iranian ideas that he got from reading Greek authors. He had a vast library of classical Greek texts, he read Greek, and he was influenced by the Persians via the Greeks.
4723700	4730700	The historical constitution of the United States was very much a reflection of the Satrapi system of the Persian Empire.
4730700	4739700	Exactly. Not a day of Christian because think about it. There's not a single script, not a single lick of Deuteronomy or numbers in the Constitution.
4739700	4740700	It is.
4740700	4744700	I mean, it's prepod, look, Jefferson took scissors to the Bible.
4744700	4756700	Yeah, there's despised Christianity, the founding father, Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, the Illuminati 33rd degree Freemason. Anyway, be that as it may.
4756700	4769700	But to go to your point, it's more not like the UN so much. It's more like when Tom Paine says, I think it was in the rights of man, the book that he wrote.
4770700	4773700	Did he write the rights of men in prison in France? I think so.
4773700	4774700	Yeah.
4774700	4788700	And so Tom Paine, the black sheep of the founding fathers, he says that the Liberty Bell of the American Revolution is not just for all nations on Earth, it should resound through the whole cosmos.
4788700	4791700	Same guy who called Christ a fable too.
4791700	4794700	Oh, he destroyed the Bible.
4794700	4807700	Anyway, not only did he think the US Constitution shouldn't be based on the Bible, he said that the US Constitution is not compatible with Christianity. And until we get rid of Christianity, we cannot have a functional government in this country.
4807700	4809700	Anyway, be that as it may.
4809700	4821700	When Paine is saying that the American Revolution and the system of liberty and the protection of personal rights that it's setting up is a standard for the whole world.
4821700	4832700	That's what the ancient Persian emperors were after they were after creating a universal order based on progress and the liberty of the individual.
4832700	4835700	So, yeah, in any case.
4835700	4860700	Yeah, you just laid out, like, I think it's just completely clear that these pillars of the West, Heraclitus, Pythagoras, and then eventually Plato, and then, you know, who would be sort of passed down through the Aristotle in mind and which branches out in many different directions.
4860700	4869700	And this comes from Saurastra. He's the, he's the monad in its own in its own way like figure speech.
4869700	4889700	Where am I going with this where I'm going with this is that, look, if the, if the Carpacrasians are worshiping statues of, or at least honoring statues of Pythagoras, and then of Plato, who's influenced by Pythagoras and Heraclitus.
4890700	4896700	What does that tell you about where the Carpacrasian teaching is coming from originally, right?
4896700	4907700	And I want to come back to the Carpacrasians in one minute and this is going to become really important. The point about Saurastra and the Carpacrasians and then Persian Gnosticism.
4907700	4912700	But let me also note that in your, I was listening to your conversation with, is it David, David, David?
4912700	4914700	I'm David Litwa.
4914700	4935700	Yeah. And Litwa, in response to a question you asked very rightly about Persian influence on Simon Magus and Litwa says, No, you know, there was a much closer source for Simon Magus than anything Zoroastrian and that would have been Heraclitus.
4935700	4939700	Well, we've already established how deeply influenced by Zarathustra Heraclitus is. Okay.
4939700	4949700	But I don't buy that Simon Magus is getting these ideas, even from Zarathustra via Heraclitus, I think he's getting them directly from Zarathustra.
4949700	4958700	And I'll tell you why when he describes the, you know, divine intelligence, not just as a cosmic fire, which is a very Zoroastrian symbol that you find in Heraclitus.
4958700	4961700	Yes, he calls God a fire. He said God is a fire.
4961700	4968700	He also talks about the seventh power and you don't find this in Heraclitus.
4968700	4972700	This is nowhere in Heraclitus. It's nowhere in any Greek thought.
4972700	4978700	The seventh power or emanation of the divine intelligence, which is thought, the divine thought, right?
4978700	4982700	The thinking power of the divine, which is a seventh emanation.
4982700	4994700	That's Sipantaminu. There are seven Amesha spent, seven of them. The seventh one, the highest one is Sipantaminu, which is what the power of thought, the divine thought, right?
4994700	4998700	I forgot about that. I wasn't even putting two to two together. That makes a lot of sense now.
4998700	5011700	It's the divine mind of Ahura Mazda, which Zarathustra and the Gathas says that, you know, the mind of Ahura Mazda exploded into myriad sparks of light and manifested the cosmic order, you know, in the Gathas.
5011700	5017700	So Christianity, with all these mages and Magoys, this is sort of another thing.
5017700	5024700	It's a descendant, a branch off of this Magi Zoroastrian.
5024700	5031700	Exactly. Look, Simon Magus, there's a reason he's called, whether he likes to call him Magus or not, there's a reason he was called that.
5031700	5034700	He was called Magus because he was a Magi. He was a member of the Order of the Magi.
5035700	5050700	And one of the first Christian cults to be in Rome, like during the time of St. Linus, who's supposedly the guy who was anointed by Peter, were talking like the first century, these Simonians who were worshiping Simon Magus, apparently.
5050700	5061700	According to Irenaeus and Hippolytus, who knows how accurate it is, but let's take them at their word value, then that means the first Christians to show up in Rome were Magi.
5061700	5071700	And this whole notion that some scholars, Western, I was going to use an epithet, but I'll just pass over that.
5071700	5083700	A lot of Western scholars try to dismiss the significance of this term Magus by saying, well, you know, it just meant the practitioner of magic or alchemy or whatever.
5083700	5095700	No, no, look, the Greeks who brought magic to Greece were accused of Medism. There was a crime in Greece called Medism.
5095700	5096700	Really?
5096700	5104700	Coming from the Medes, the Median people, one of the four branches of the ancient Iranians. The Medes are closest to today's Kurds.
5104700	5113700	And so, and they ruled Iran before the Persians. The Persians overtook the Medes and incorporated them into the Persian Empire.
5113700	5123700	So the Medes were the first Iranians that the Greeks had encountered and the Magi are the priests or wise men of the Medes.
5123700	5141700	And Magi, wise men of the Medes, people practicing magic in Greece, and also the revolutionary pre-Socratic philosophers were accused of Medism, meaning bringing foreign Iranian, Iranian specifically ideas to Greece in a way that's considered treasonous.
5141700	5147700	Like, you know, the McCarthy hearings in America where they were all calling these guys commies and Russian agents and whatever.
5147700	5153700	Well, like Socrates' trial, he gets executed for importing foreign deities. No one even knows what those are.
5153700	5167700	His teacher, Socrates' teacher, Espacia, I mean, she wasn't, like I said, the guy was a bum. So she wasn't his teacher in any formal sense, but there was this older woman that he hung out with and he was very influenced by her Espacia.
5167700	5172700	And she was a mistress of Pericles, I believe.
5172700	5178700	And anyway, she was accused of Medism. She was one of these people who actually was charged with Medism.
5178700	5189700	So it's not true that Magus just meant magician. Magus had a very culturally specific connotation and it meant those people associated with that Iranian shit over there.
5189700	5192700	I've actually heard someone else tell me exactly what you said is not.
5193700	5200700	Other people very, very entrenched in this type of area that that's it was became a slang term.
5200700	5205700	Yeah, yeah, like you're a Magi, but really that just could mean a million things.
5205700	5209700	Right. You know, it's like Gnostic. Like, what's a Gnostic? I don't know.
5209700	5224700	My point is it had a culturally specific association. And so aside from the fact that you've got Simon Magus talking about cosmic fire and the seventh power as the divine intellect, God's power of thought, which you don't find even in Heraclitus.
5224700	5229700	You know, the guys identified as a major, you know, as a member of the major in order.
5229700	5239700	So, yeah, so you got this association of Simon Magus with Zarathustra and then to go back to the Carpacrations. Okay.
5239700	5247700	This is something I think your viewers may not be familiar with and it's tremendously significant.
5247700	5269700	So the Carpacrations were accused of having all these basically ecstatic orgies and, you know, that they were libertines who believed in not just relinquishing private property, but in overcoming the notion of
5270700	5285700	property that underlies monogamous marriage. In other words, holding other people as property, right? Being able to overcome the aspects of the human ego that express themselves in greed and
5286700	5289700	avaricious behavior.
5289700	5313700	And so they were radical communists who didn't only want to abolish private property, they thought that love was somehow diminished or constrained by monogamous marriage and its association with property holding and the whole patriarchal economic system of the time.
5313700	5331700	And interestingly enough, there is a Gnostic sect in Iran, who has exactly this same teaching called the Mazdikites. And these Mazdikites claimed to be the true heirs to the teaching of Zarathustra.
5331700	5337700	They thought that the Sasanid Persian Empire, the second Persian Empire.
5337700	5348700	There are three Iranian empires in antiquity, the Achaemenid Empire, the Parthian Empire and the Sasanid Empire, but the Parthians were Scythians. They were not Persians.
5348700	5358700	So the second Persian Empire is the Sasanid Persian Empire from about 200 AD to 650 when they were conquered by Islam 650 AD.
5358700	5366700	And during the Sasanid Persian Empire, these Mazdikites, again Mazda means wisdom, right?
5366700	5367700	Right.
5367700	5377700	These Mazdikites, they argued that the Sasanid priesthood had set up an orthodoxy that was a total perversion of the teachings of Zarathustra.
5377700	5387700	And they represented the true teachings of Zarathustra. And interestingly enough, they're advocating communism, the abolishing of private property, right?
5387700	5397700	But then also free love and a transcendence of monogamous marriage and basically, you know, open, you know, amorous relationships between men and women and so forth.
5397700	5407700	Which was, for them, also a way of breaking up harems and destroying aristocratic bloodlines, right, destroying the landed feudal aristocracy.
5407700	5423700	And although the, okay, so now the Mazdikites, as radical as this teaching seems, the Mazdikites were able to seize control of the Sasanid Persian Empire for no less than 30 years in the early 500s,
5423700	5443700	505 to 520s, 530 AD, through a court minister called Mazdak, this movement, which was subsequently named after him, but had an older name I'll come to in a moment.
5443700	5459700	This movement seized control of the Persian state. There was a king who, Kovac, who supposedly was sympathetic to it, and he basically let Mazdak have free reign and they took over the government and they created a, I mean, insane, radical,
5459700	5466700	Gnostic communist society in Iran for 30 years.
5466700	5467700	Wow.
5467700	5471700	Okay, before they were finally, of course, you can imagine how the story ended, they were all master.
5471700	5473700	Israel for Islam comes around.
5473700	5487700	Right, exact. Well, the trauma of this incident is, I think, in large part what rendered the Persian Empire vulnerable to being conquered by Islam. There had been an internal revolution and civil war before the Arabs came in and made short work of it.
5487700	5490700	That's why the Persian Empire was so vulnerable.
5490700	5491700	Yeah.
5491700	5494700	They had basically turned on themselves first.
5494700	5496700	Makes a lot of sense.
5496700	5512700	And here's my point is that if you look in the heresy, hereseological texts about the Mazdakites, they all say that this movement was already hundreds of years old when it took control of the state, which kind of makes sense.
5512700	5522700	I mean, for it to have become that powerful and entrenched that it could actually topple the government, it would take a long time to build that kind of following throughout the whole of the Persian Empire.
5522700	5530700	And they say the movement actually goes back to at least 200 AD.
5530700	5533700	And when are we dealing with the Carpacrasian order?
5533700	5538700	About 100, about 50 to 50 to 100 years earlier.
5538700	5539700	Right.
5539700	5543700	And so these are very close in historical timeframe.
5543700	5557700	Oh, and not to mention the writings that are found from Nag Hammadi and other places in Egypt like Alexandria that are related to movements such as the Carpacritus and other movements, mostly in Egypt, Christianity.
5557700	5560700	They're Zoraster and his grandfather.
5560700	5561700	What's his name?
5561700	5562700	Zossimovs, I think it is.
5562700	5563700	Yes.
5563700	5570700	But yeah, there's, it's not even, this is not even like hidden or like through philosophy is through philosophy.
5570700	5576700	They're literally reading and translating in Coptic, the writings of Zoraster and his grandfather.
5576700	5577700	Right.
5577700	5583700	And so they say this movement goes back to like, at least 280.
5583700	5592700	And it comes from the state of Iran, the province of Iran, from which the Persian Empire gets its name, namely Persis, Persa.
5592700	5593700	Right.
5593700	5603700	And which is around where Shiraz is today. It's where Persepolis, the ruins of Persepolis are. It's where the city of Shiraz is, where, you know, the Shiraz wine comes from and so on and so forth.
5603700	5613700	Anyway, they say the guy who founded this movement, which was originally called Dorostinan, or the partisans of justice.
5613700	5615700	Remember that text, the Carpacritian text on justice?
5615700	5616700	Yeah.
5616700	5617700	Social justice.
5617700	5621700	So it was called the movement of the just.
5621700	5628700	And its founder was a guy called Zardost, which is a middle Persian Zarathustra.
5628700	5637700	So we have the second Zarathustra, the second Zoroaster preaching this doctrine, which is identical to the Carpacritian doctrine.
5637700	5647700	And then the Carpacritians are setting up statues of Pythagoras and a Plato who's influenced by Pythagoras and by Heraclitus, both of whom were Persian agents.
5647700	5652700	And not incidentally, I neglected to mention that the magi attended Plato's funeral.
5652700	5653700	Oh, that's right.
5653700	5654700	That's a big one.
5654700	5661700	They came from Iran. They attended Plato's funeral. And they said he was one of our own. They attended in the capacity of like honoring a brother.
5661700	5662700	That's a big deal.
5662700	5667700	Oh, Zostrianos. That's the guy's name. Is that really his grandfather? Zoroaster's grandfather?
5667700	5673700	I don't think so. But I think that it's very significant that the Gnostics wanted to say that.
5673700	5676700	That's what I'm saying. They're attributing, even if they're making this up.
5676700	5679700	It's a pedigree. They want to establish for themselves.
5679700	5689700	It shows you how entrenched, how interested, and how valuable Zoroastrian ideas were to the Gnostic movements in Egypt.
5689700	5691700	Carpacritians. That's what they were.
5691700	5699700	Absolutely. And then, look, I mean, we've gone for a long time, but we can't neglect Manny, right?
5699700	5702700	Yeah, I'm so glad you brought that up.
5702700	5708700	So many streams of Gnostic thought come from out of Manny and Manichaeism.
5708700	5720700	Like, for example, the Bogomio movement of southeastern Europe, mainly associated with Bulgaria, but there's a lot of scholarship that says that it came from Constantinople originally.
5720700	5721700	Interesting.
5721700	5733700	The Bogomio movement. And then you've got the Cathars in the Occital region, which stretched from mainly southern France into part of Italy and part of Spain on the Mediterranean.
5733700	5743700	The Cathar movement and the Bogomio movement were both branded by the inquisitors of the Catholic Church as, quote, Manichaeism, unquote.
5743700	5744700	Yeah.
5744700	5745700	So according to the...
5745700	5748700	The call against the Maniches was the reputation.
5748700	5749700	Yeah.
5749700	5752700	According to the Catholic Church, these people were Manichaeans.
5752700	5753700	Right.
5753700	5754700	What does that tell you?
5754700	5757700	That tells you this is a Persian movement to the eyes of the church.
5757700	5759700	In the eyes of the church, exactly.
5759700	5763700	And so, Manny, who is Manny?
5763700	5768700	Manny was a Parthian royal.
5768700	5769700	He was a...
5769700	5771700	Remember, so I mentioned there was the second Iranian Empire.
5771700	5773700	It wasn't Persian, but it was Iranian.
5773700	5776700	The Parthian Empire, they were descendants of Scythians.
5776700	5777700	And...
5777700	5779700	They were descendants of a disciple of Jesus.
5779700	5780700	Yes.
5780700	5797700	And so, Manny was from a Parthian royal bloodline, born in Mesopotamia, which, again, the capital of Iran in the Parthian period was also in Mesopotamia, and had a city called Ctesiphon.
5797700	5804700	And so, he's from this royal lineage and his mother is a Christian.
5804700	5812700	And so, his father is a Parthian, either Zoroastrian or Mithrest, probably, in ancestry, and his mother is a Christian.
5812700	5825700	And he basically develops this doctrine that intensifies the dualism latent in Zarathustra's message.
5825700	5827700	So, Zarathustra is not a dualist, right?
5827700	5834700	And this opposition between Sepanto-minu and Angra-minu is still sort of under the divine intelligence of Ahura Mazda.
5834700	5838700	And it's not meant to suggest that there is on an ontological level.
5838700	5843700	In other words, in the nature of reality, some kind of a split between a material world and a spiritual world.
5843700	5845700	You don't find that in the Gaphas.
5845700	5848700	So, Zarathustra is not an ontological dualist, okay?
5848700	5850700	But he's got these two principles.
5850700	5853700	And Manny takes these two principles of...
5853700	5855700	By his time, it's Ormazd.
5855700	5860700	The contraction of Ahura Mazda, Ormazd and Ahriman, contraction of Angra-minu.
5860700	5867700	He takes these and he radicalizes them into a real substantive ontological dualism.
5867700	5875700	And he says there are two worlds, a material world governed by Ahriman and a spiritual world like the Pluroma.
5875700	5878700	That's the world of Ahura Mazda.
5878700	5885700	And we are sparks of the divine that have been trapped in this material world.
5885700	5892700	And we basically have it as our spiritual work to free this divine spark within us so that it can rejoin the light.
5892700	5898700	You know, the realm of light and transcend this realm of dark physicality.
5899700	5909700	And so he develops this Gnostic doctrine and various elements of his teaching fuse ideas from Zarathustra,
5909700	5921700	the Gnostic Jesus, which at this time we're talking Manny's around 200, early 200s AD.
5921700	5926700	And in fact, specifically under the reign of Shahpur the Great, and this is not incidental,
5926700	5936700	Shahpur the Great, the most militarily successful emperor of the Second Persian Empire becomes the patron of Manny.
5936700	5939700	He becomes his patron, which is kind of bizarre.
5939700	5944700	I mean this guy like, Shahpur is like Marcus Aurelius.
5944700	5950700	He expanded the Persian Empire dramatically and he takes Manny in.
5950700	5957700	And I say it's bizarre because, you know, people think of Mannychism as this world denying aesthetic doctrine of like,
5957700	5967700	oh, go put, you know, put yourself in a monastic cell somewhere and deny your physical impulses and try to purify your spirit and whatever.
5967700	5970700	There's no way that this could have been Manny's actual teaching,
5970700	5976700	even if he prescribed some kind of a monastic way of life for a certain class of people.
5976700	5988700	Shahpur would never have taken in a guy like that into the court and would never have backed this guy to go on evangelical missions as far as India and China.
5988700	5993700	You know, the Mannychians, their legacy survived for centuries in China.
5993700	5997700	A lot of Mannychian texts that we have are actually from Northwestern China.
5997700	6004700	And so Shahpur is backing this guy to go on these wide travels and what's the deal here?
6004700	6008700	Well, the deal is that Shahpur is starting to conquer a large part of the Roman Empire.
6008700	6016700	He's famously depicted in the Parse province of Iran that I mentioned earlier on the stones next to Persepolis.
6016700	6022700	He's depicted forcing Caesar Valerian of Rome to kneel before his horse.
6022700	6024700	It's a great rock carving. You can look it up.
6024700	6031700	Very famous of Shahpur on horseback with Caesar Valerian of Rome on his knees looking up to Shahpur under the hooves of his horse.
6031700	6035700	And so Shahpur is conquering large parts of the Roman Empire in the West.
6035700	6041700	And he's conquering large parts of India and all the way up to the border of Northwestern China in the East.
6041700	6045700	And so Shahpur is looking for a world religion. He wants to create one world religion.
6045700	6048700	And he's looking at Manny as a guy who can do it for him.
6048700	6054700	And so Manny takes Zarathustra and the Gnostic Jesus and Buddha.
6054700	6062700	And he fuses them into one religion that includes belief in reincarnation and the Buddha of light.
6062700	6071700	And all these ideas you find that survive in Mahayana and pure land Buddhism and so forth to create one world religion.
6071700	6073700	Gnostic religion.
6073700	6077700	Yeah, it's very similar to the Carpocrations in that sense where they have these three figures.
6077700	6091700	Yes, and the Kathar way of life, I think tells us a lot about what Manichaeism was like because it's true that you had perfecty in the Kathar religion.
6091700	6096700	They call them perfecty perfected people who lived a monastic life.
6096700	6099700	And they were very aesthetic.
6099700	6103700	But these perfecty would only become perfecty when they were geezers.
6103700	6108700	Okay, it was old men and old women who would become perfecty.
6108700	6117700	When the Kathars were younger, you know, in Occitanian culture, they were all mixed up with the troubadours who were these traveling romantic poets.
6117700	6122700	And they were also clearly closely allied with the Knights Templar.
6122700	6128700	And sometimes troubadours in medieval Occitan would become Kathar perfecty later in life.
6128700	6136700	And sometimes Templar Knights would become Kathar perfecty after living lives full of, you know, brutal conquest, right?
6136700	6139700	And these wars of, you know, conquest in the Middle East and so forth.
6139700	6159700	So you've got like erotic poets who are libertines preaching basically all kinds of orgiastic, you know, practices and writing about them in these romantic poems that they sing in the courts of various medieval ladies.
6159700	6168700	And you've got these, you know, military men who are certainly not pacifists for most of their lives and they're becoming Kathar perfecty.
6168700	6181700	And so I think this shows you how Shahpour was able to accommodate Mani's teaching because it was not this naive, overly idealistic world denying teaching.
6181700	6196700	It had different classes of worshipers and it had a realistic view of human society and the laity were not expected to adhere to this kind of asceticism that you find among the perfecty.
6196700	6204700	And then of course there was a notion of reincarnation. So, you know, you had many lifetimes to perfect your soul, which you also find in the Kathars.
6204700	6218700	So the Manikians are another group of Gnostics who are deeply influenced by Zarathustra. Zarathustra is one of the three great world teachers for Mani, again together like I mentioned earlier with the Gnostic Christ and with Buddha.
6219700	6235700	And so another major stream of Gnosticism influenced by Zarathustra is this radically dualist school that we see coming from out of Manikism and all of its off sheets, Bogomilism, Katharism and so forth.
6235700	6250700	Yeah, that's so, there's so much to, there's so much that comes all back to Zarathustra. You can just, it's like a bunch of lines of trees branches that just go back to this time period.
6250700	6263700	And it's a time period that's contemporary with a lot of other, you know, Isaiah, Jose, you know, the Babylonians and, and like it's, it's just fascinating to think about it like that.
6263700	6281700	I actually have a question for you because I was thinking about this, there's a high, there was the second temple period Judaism, they had these high priests that are named Harkness, and there's a, there's a thought that maybe they're from Harkania, and they were taking in priests that
6281700	6295700	like new ancient rites that they somehow lost after being captive in Babylon for all these time. And they wanted to bring in like priests that knew what they were doing. So they brought in these Harkanian priests is that you can think about that.
6295700	6297700	You said this is in the second temple period.
6297700	6298700	Yeah.
6299700	6313700	And by the way, this is right after Cyrus was called the Messiah, not by. Oh, he's a Messiah like Solomon. No, Messiah from the word of God himself, my shepherd. So that's pretty big deal.
6313700	6323700	Listen, we could have a whole, a whole show on this subject because I'm about to say something that's extremely incendiary and respond to your question.
6324700	6331700	By the way, if people are interested, this is the book in which I discuss Zarathustra at length. Yeah.
6331700	6343700	I got a link in the description too. So people can run in Leviathan. And I'm pointing to it right now because I have a whole chapter on what I'm about to say, which is very incendiary in response to your question.
6343700	6345700	But we could do a whole show on it sometime.
6345700	6346700	Sure.
6346700	6351700	I think you're probably right.
6351700	6365700	Why? Because, again, I apologize for this in advance, but the whole thing about Cyrus being the Messiah of the Jews and why Cyrus rebuilt the temple of Solomon.
6366700	6382700	When he relocated, when he left the Jews of Babylon who had been in captivity, moved back home. Of course, a lot of them stayed back in Babylon. And by the way, do you know what the Jews who stayed back and behind in Babylon and capital of the Persian Empire did instead of returning to Israel?
6382700	6386700	They ran the banking system.
6386700	6398700	The Persian emperor set up the first banking system of the world with standardized coinage. They invented checks. Checks were invented by the Persian emperor, specifically by Darius the Great.
6398700	6407700	And the Jews were involved in the Babylonian banking system under the Persian Empire.
6407700	6422700	And anyway, long story short, I make an argument in Iranian Leviathan in a chapter that I playfully titled this chapter.
6422700	6433700	Tekel, tekel, man is shekel. Yeah, that's from Daniel. Yeah. Well, it's a play on the words in Daniel. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tekel, tekel, man is shekel because the shekel.
6433700	6449700	Shekel means image in Persian. It means face. And it was specifically referring to the face of Darius on the coins called Darax. And so the word for money in Hebrew comes from the image of Darius the Great on Persian coinage.
6449700	6464700	In any case, I'm getting diverted. Yeah, the whole business of Cyrus the Great and the creation of the Second Temple and the relocation of the Jews, their, their, you know, their Odyssey back home to Israel.
6464700	6475700	Okay. And the writing of the Hebrew Bible as we know it today, which dates back to that time under Cyrus and Cambyses.
6475700	6481700	Yeah. The whole thing was a Persian plot.
6481700	6494700	I make an argument for this in Iranian Leviathan. Second Temple Judaism is a creation of an Illuminati elite who were myth rests in the Persian Empire.
6494700	6511700	And the transformation that we see inside Judaism, which are extensive at that time that involved notions like punishment in hell, individual soul, becoming apocalypse. I mean, all these ideas that you don't find at all in ancient Israelite religion.
6511700	6523700	And they are social engineering mechanisms that were specifically introduced into Judaism by myth reik.
6523700	6534700	I don't even want to call them priests myth reik social engineers who had a much wider agenda in terms of creating a new world order is what they were really after.
6534700	6547700	The banking system was part of that new world order, but a transformation in religion was also part of that new world order. And so Cyrus Cyrus was not a Zoroastrian Cyrus was a myth rest.
6547700	6558700	I make an argument for this. And the guy who he appointed to be responsible for the Second Temple project and the relocation of the Jews was a man named Mithra Dotties, which means myth was justice.
6558700	6559700	Right.
6560700	6567700	Yeah, so I would not be at all surprised if they brought your canyons. Yeah, yeah, Israel.
6567700	6579700	There was two of them that name too. And that's when baptism becomes a thing in Judaism to at that time. So it all just makes sense. And the last thing I'm going to say that I'm going to blow some people's minds with this, I want to get your opinion.
6579700	6589700	And then we can finish off. You can tie it all together. Last thing I want to say is this because the that movement continues up until the time of Pompey and Caesar.
6589700	6594700	So the same year. Well, I should say, before that crisis tries to go into Parthia.
6595700	6614700	It's killed. Pompey, the great sex temple of Jerusalem. And there's a big, that's a big deal, because now the priesthood that is held by the Persians is now in the hands of guess what, the same year 63 BC, that Pompey sex Jerusalem is the same year they hold an election.
6614700	6631700	And, and, and Julius Caesar becomes the high priest of the entire Roman Empire, Pontifus Maximus, same title as Pope right now, by the way, guess who else, guess what else happens that year. Cicero is console, and Augustus is born, baby Augustus.
6631700	6636700	And they're in the writers of what's his name. I can't remember the guy's name who wrote this.
6636700	6646700	Anyway, it's passed down through like Tacitus and Sonia. They're all they're all talking about this. And this is widespread. And you can go look this up. It's public knowledge. There was a supposedly a star in the sky.
6646700	6654700	Said any male to be born this year will be the king of the world. So they're basically saying glasses is like a messiah. Anyways, long story short, let's fast forward a little bit.
6654700	6660700	Julius Caesar gets killed. Julius Caesar had plans to go east. He had plans to do it. He wanted to.
6660700	6669700	Alexander the Great was his God, basically he wanted to be the next Alexander the Great, but he couldn't do it. Mark Antony also wanted to do the same thing.
6669700	6680700	But he ends up battling with Augustus. Now the question is, why didn't Augustus do it. But Gus has had all the, all the, all the stars were aligned for Augustus to go east and do it Alexander the Great did.
6680700	6697700	And I'll tell you why Nicholas of Damascus tells us why the, the, the king of India, porous, same name as the king that under Alexander the Great just coincidentally, he sends delegates, Brahmin delegates to go meet with Augustus, and they bring him
6697700	6713700	to the lions and oils and fragments and all these exotic presents and money and basically make a deal. And it's, and the reason why I'm bringing all this up is because right after this happens, by the way, one of the delegates goes with Augustus to
6714700	6726700	Lucius to get initiated in these rites. And after he's apparently he saw something when he drank, he drank, drank the kaikyan had the experience. Apparently he saw something that changed his life.
6726700	6735700	He jumped into a fire after that and killed himself because he no longer had anything else to live for. He, his life was complete. He wanted to die at that moment. That's recorded Nicholas of Damascus.
6735700	6749700	Anyway, the reason why I brought all that up is because right after this, Augustus dedicate 72 temples across the, across the Empire, and a lot of them were Mithra temples, and he becomes obsessed with the fire of Vesta.
6749700	6755700	No, no, don't let the fire of Vesta go out. And all of a sudden Mithraism is a boom in the Roman Empire.
6755700	6768700	So I don't think it's a, and I think that's what happened. I think they're, I think he, something changed his mind with these delegates, and all of a sudden Eastern religions were where the hit Christianity is not even that long after that.
6768700	6769700	What do you think?
6769700	6775700	That's very interesting. That's a fascinating story which I hadn't heard before, but it makes a hell of a lot of sense to me.
6775700	6787700	Because as we discussed in the previous show we did on Mithraism, the Parthians had, I mean of course you know Parthia was the main rival of Rome, that was Iran in the time of the Roman Empire.
6787700	6799700	And so he would have had to march against the Parthians. And like we discussed in the previous show we did together the Parthians had extensive agents operating in the seats of power in the Roman Empire.
6799700	6819700	And among the aristocracy in particular, they would, they would infiltrate through the port cities using the Selisian pirates. And so I could well imagine that what you're saying was some kind of a Parthian plot where they decided to use Indians as emissaries because
6819700	6832700	Indians had a lot of influence in North, they basically were trying to turn North, North, you know, Northwestern India was a vassal state of the one or another Iranian Empire for almost all of its history.
6832700	6843700	And the Parthians were trying to establish the same relationship with that part of India. So it's quite possible that the Indian emissaries that were sent there, you know, the Parthians knew Romans aren't going to listen to us.
6843700	6863700	You know, but we can send these Indians and they can basically do a sigh up on these Romans. And, you know, get them not to invade Parthia, you know, and so who knows that makes a lot of sense in that wider context of psychological warfare between Parthia and Rome.
6864700	6875700	And if you want to, I think we've covered a lot of ground, we can do this for hours. But if you want to give it, you know, anything else you want to say tying everything together or if you want to just promote your books or anything, and we'll finish off.
6875700	6885700	Well, the only book I would say, which I already pointed out, I mean, a lot of these subjects we've discussed are in Iranian Leviathan. I mean, that's really my major treatment of Zarathustra.
6886700	6905700	Although there's a bit about Zarathustra in particular relation to Gnosticism in this book as well, a novel folklore. I get into certain Gnostic teachings, in particular, Manichaeism, and the ways in which it develops Zoroastrian ideas.
6906700	6924700	But, you know, I had been thinking to go on to a discussion of modern Gnosticism, but I see in retrospect that we could do a whole show on that subject, because you see Zarathustra is rediscovered in the modern period in the 1700s by linguists,
6924700	6938700	Darmester, and others who translate the Zen, the Vesta for the first time, into European languages. And then you've got people like Hegel and Nietzsche reading these texts in German translation.
6938700	6949700	And Zarathustra then becomes very important for modern, you know, like early modern European culture, to the point where you have Zarathustra become the mouthpiece for Nietzsche.
6949700	6962700	And thus spoke Zarathustra and, you know, Richard Strauss, naming ultimately, you know, orchestral piece after Zarathustra, Mozart, in Mozart's Magic Flute, he appears as Zarastro.
6962700	6974700	So there's this whole revival of Zarathustra. Voltaire refers to Zarathustra as the religious prophet most suitable to the ideals of the Age of Enlightenment.
6975700	6977700	He calls him Zarastro, of course.
6977700	6984700	Does Carl Jung have anything to do with it? Because I know he revamps Gnosticism in his own way, big time.
6984700	6989700	I'm sure Zarathustra is mentioned in Jung. Of course, Jung engages with Nietzsche.
6989700	6990700	Yeah.
6990700	6995700	So, you know, via Nietzsche, you know, he engages with Zarathustra.
6996700	7007700	But Jungian psychology is so deeply indebted to the ideas that Plato absorbed from Zarathustra, in particular, you know, the archetypes, right?
7007700	7008700	Yeah, that's a good point.
7008700	7023700	Right? So, and then the aspects of Jung that are often referred to as Gnostic, when people say, call Jung a Gnostic, those are really Zarathustrian, not to say Zarastrian, but they go back to Zarathustra.
7023700	7025700	Because, see, Jung is not a dualist.
7025700	7031700	There's a lot of aspects of Jungian thought that don't fit various facets of Gnosticism.
7031700	7042700	And the aspects of Jung that are Gnostic are the ones that Gnosticism shares in common with Zarathustra's teaching or really has inherited from Zarathustra's teaching.
7042700	7044700	Okay, so that's...
7045700	7059700	That's a thing because in the Red Book, he even talks about this whole battle between Satan and Christ and nobody wins and ends up being like this giant explosion where Abraxas comes out and he's like the embodiment of all.
7059700	7061700	He's everything.
7061700	7062700	Like he is, you can't escape Abraxas.
7062700	7063700	He's basically the one.
7063700	7066700	They didn't say that, but that's basically what he's, you know, getting at.
7066700	7069700	That's very similar to Zorvan ideas.
7069700	7071700	And I know at some point you wanted to discuss the...
7071700	7073700	Yeah, we should get into that.
7074700	7084700	So, you know, I'm envisioning another program we do together that's focused on what Eric Vogelin calls modern Gnosticism.
7084700	7093700	In other words, the Gnosticism of the period of like Hegel and Nietzsche and, you know, even Auguste Compton and so forth.
7093700	7095700	The Age of Enlightenment, right?
7095700	7097700	Going into the 19th century.
7097700	7104700	Gnosticism in that context and the rediscovery of Zarathustra in that context, right?
7104700	7119700	And that could be a context for also engaging with Zorvanism because people said that, for example, Adler referred to Nietzsche as a Zorvanist parcy without really knowing it,
7119700	7130700	that Nietzsche's take on Zarathustra was basically the type of interpretation and adaptation of Zarathustra that we see in the ancient Zorvanites.
7130700	7135700	So, yeah, we could have a whole program on that and I look forward to continuing the conversation there.
7135700	7142700	Well, guys, leave in the comments what you guys thought about all this and if you want to add anything to the conversation, I will read them.
7142700	7148700	And we will do this again in the near future and you have just attained true Gnosis.
7149700	7156700	The Demiurge has no power over you.
7179700	7185700	The Demiurge has no power over you.
7185700	7191700	The Demiurge has no power over you.
7191700	7197700	The Demiurge has no power over you.
7197700	7203700	The Demiurge has no power over you.
7203700	7208700	The Demiurge has no power over you.
