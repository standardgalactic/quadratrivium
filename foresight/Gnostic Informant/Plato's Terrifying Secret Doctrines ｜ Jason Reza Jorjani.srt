1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Plato's noble lie isn't simply one concept or one strategy that he deploys as part of the larger edifice of his thought.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Plato's entire philosophical project could be seen as a noble lie, where my thesis is essentially that Plato didn't believe in the existence of the forms.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That he contrived this doctrine for the purposes of psychological and social engineering.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Before he met Socrates, he was an aspiring tragic poet in the theater of Dionysus, and the story is that after he heard Socrates talk, he burned his great tragedy in an offering to Prometheus.

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
He calls forth the god of fire and decides to become a student of Socrates, but he's coming from the background of having been a tragic poet.

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Dionysus is the god associated with tragedy.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:32,000
A case can be made that people who understood very well what Plato's esoteric project was, and people who knew how to deploy noble lies engineered the Abrahamic revelation, the biblical religion as a catalyst for the transformation of society.

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But the catalyst was not intended to get people to become good Jews, or later good Christians, or even later good Muslims.

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The catalyst was intended to get people to go to the devil, instigate rebellion, give people models of challenging authority.

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's very Plato. His intention was to separate the goat from the sheep.

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Well, it's great to be back with you.

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah.

13
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We've been planning this talk on Plato for a really long time, and it's a difficult subject to approach.

14
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I've written two essays that are relevant to it, which I want to reference right up front, because as deep as we may go here, it's still only going to be scratching the surface compared to the complexity of what I've written in these essays.

15
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And the most important of them is called The Pharmacon Artist in Lovers of Sophia.

16
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So I believe it's the second essay in this book.

17
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This book Lovers of Sophia, it's an anthology.

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's a collection of essays rather than really being a book.

19
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And these essays were actually written before Prometheus and Atlas.

20
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I think almost every piece in Lovers of Sophia preceded Prometheus and Atlas in some cases significantly.

21
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And frankly, I have to confess that Pharmacon Artist is the oldest of them.

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So in that essay on Plato, which is fitting, because as I quote Alfred North Whitehead at the beginning of this essay, some people have taken the view that the whole history of Western philosophy consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.

23
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's how Whitehead put it.

24
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And so I suppose it's fitting that my own first philosophical work was my interpretation of Plato, which is an essay of almost book length.

25
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It could be a short book.

26
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And I wrote it in my 20s.

27
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And in a lot of ways, this essay The Pharmacon Artist can be seen as an esoteric key to my entire corpus.

28
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And by the end of our conversation, maybe I'm going to highlight a few ways in which that's the case.

29
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So that essay in Lovers of Sophia, and then there is a chapter in Prometheus and Atlas toward the end.

30
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I believe it is chapter 9 of Prometheus and Atlas.

31
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Atlas of the New Atlantis deals with Plato's quote myth, unquote, of Atlantis.

32
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And we'll get into that as well here because I think it's very relevant to understanding what we could call Plato's unwritten doctrine or esoteric Plato.

33
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
His knowledge concerning Atlantis is very relevant to that subject.

34
00:04:46,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And in that chapter, Atlas of the New Atlantis, I get into, you know, Plato's understanding of Atlantis and how it's related to the way in which he wanted to transform Greek society.

35
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So anyway, those are the two references that I wanted to give up front.

36
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And I mean, do you have any prefertory remarks you'd like to make before we jump in?

37
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah, I just want to lay this out for people that this we didn't know that we didn't plan this out as a series to begin with, but it's becoming it's materializing as one now.

38
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So we started off our discussion. This is going to be a four part playlist on my channel for people who are watching.

39
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's okay if you use the first video you stumble on, you can watch this one first, you can watch them in any order.

40
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But I would prefer to start off with the Mithra video because Mithra is such an ancient idea that has his has his tentacles in the Vedic world as well as the Western world.

41
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And then so that was our first video we introduced that and then we went into Zoroaster and Zoroaster coming out of the Mithraic tradition,

42
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
which revolutionizes religion, theology, philosophy for the entire Western world.

43
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And so then after that video we did Prometheism.

44
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And why that's so important to come third is because from the Prometheism video really shows that there's a divide in the world between people who are submitting to this idea of a tyrant god, the L cults, the Judeo-Christian religions,

45
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
versus the Promethean religions of divine knowledge that you yourself become like the gods.

46
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So there's this idea of the two and now we're getting into Plato.

47
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And so Plato is going to be the end of all this, but also the beginning of something else.

48
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And so if you want, based on what I just said, tell us why this is so important to have Plato at the end of this.

49
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You know, I don't want to go on about Iran again, you know, and continue to give people the impression that I'm some kind of Persian chauvinist.

50
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But there are a few points that could be made with relation to these other conversations of ours that you referenced.

51
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And one is that, of course, Plato was a member of the Pythagorean order.

52
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
After the death of Socrates, Plato went to Italy and joined the Pythagorean order.

53
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And, you know, of course, Pythagoras himself had studied at length in Egypt.

54
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And so Plato kind of followed Pythagoras' footsteps and then studied in Egypt for a while, tracing, you know, some Pythagorean ideas to their source in ancient Egyptian wisdom.

55
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But as we've discussed in our previous conversations, Pythagoras also studied for over a decade in the capital of the Persian Empire.

56
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He was brought back to the capital of Iran by Cambyses II, the son of Cyrus the Great.

57
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And he studied with the Magi in Babylon, the administrative capital of, you know, Achaemenid Iran.

58
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And so, and by the way, Pythagoras only left Iran when the Persians conquered Samos.

59
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He was from Samos.

60
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And so he only goes home once his homeland, his island, becomes part of the Persian Empire.

61
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And there's some evidence to suggest that basically he was kind of sent on a mission by the Magi and that his founding of the Pythagorean order in Sicily is an extension of sort of the Magian order of Babylon and so forth.

62
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And so here you have one of Plato's sources of wisdom, namely the Pythagorean order, having been fundamentally shaped by Mithraic, Zoroastrian thought.

63
00:08:45,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And then Plato, as we're going to get into in this conversation, very significantly, Plato's, I don't know if you want to say, second most important source of influence, whatever, another major influence on him was the School of Heraclitus.

64
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And in fact, let me reference this right here.

65
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Okay, Aristotle tells us that Plato in his youth, presumably after the death of Socrates, Socrates died when Plato was still quite young.

66
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But presumably, immediately after the death of Socrates, Plato became a Heraclitian, and specifically he studied with this Heraclitian teacher, Cradolis, okay, Cradolis who was a thinker in the School of Heraclitus.

67
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And actually, we just want to take the time for a moment to read this quote here, because it's very significant to the argument that I want to lay out about Plato's unwritten doctrine.

68
00:09:49,000 --> 00:10:07,000
One is where Aristotle tells us in his metaphysics, quote, for as a young man, Plato was originally an associate of Cradolis and Heraclitian opinions to the effect that all perceptible things were in a permanent state of flux, and that there was no knowledge of them.

69
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And these things he also later on maintained, unquote.

70
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Then there's another remark regarding this from Aristotle, also in his metaphysics, and by the way, for those who are not familiar, Aristotle was Plato's student, okay.

71
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Actually, Aristotle was Plato's greatest student, even though Plato did not choose him to head the academy after his death.

72
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So, you know, Aristotle is a fairly good witness and source of testimony regarding the developmental trajectory of Plato's thought.

73
00:10:40,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And the other thing he tells us in metaphysics concerning the Heraclitian background to Plato's philosophy is this quote, now the starting point for those who came up with the theory of forms was a conviction of the truth of the Heraclitian considerations to the effect that all perceptible objects are in a permanent state of flux,

74
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:20,000
so that a condition on the very possibility of knowledge and understanding was the existence, in addition to the perceptible ones of certain other natural entities which are not in a state of flux, on the assumption that entities in flux were not possible objects of knowledge, unquote.

75
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Okay, so this is what Aristotle tells us about.

76
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And then there's one other remark that's specifically about Plato's Heraclitian teacher, Cratalus.

77
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So this is Aristotle commenting on Plato's teacher from the School of Heraclitus, quote, they meaning the Heraclitians, observed that all nature around us undergoes change and held that one cannot speak the truth about that which is undergoing change.

78
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So a for teriori, nothing true could be said about what was changing at all points in all ways. This is the position of those who appropriated the legacy of Heraclitus, notably of Cratalus.

79
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:12,000
His mature position was that speech of any kind was radically inappropriate and that expression should be restricted exclusively to the movement of the finger.

80
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:25,000
He was appalled that Heraclitus had claimed that you could not step twice into the same river. In his Cratalus's opinion, it was already going too far to admit stepping into the same river once.

81
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So that was, well, I presented that as a kind of a side, but it's going to become key to the argument that I want to make. But I took the time to just, you know,

82
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:51,000
put those quotes out there because Heraclitus was invited by Darius the Great, the Emperor of the Persian Empire to be the court philosopher of Iran.

83
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Wow.

84
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Okay, so look, in a country where you have all these Magi who are the bearers of the legacy of Zarathustra, Darius doesn't choose one of his fellow Iranian magi to be the court philosopher of the Persian Empire.

85
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:16,000
He invites this Greek from Ephesus to come to the Persian court. Now, of course, Heraclitus refuses.

86
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Instead, he exiles himself to the temple of Artemis in Ephesus, never leaves other than to come out onto the temple steps and play games with children whose parents are, you know, visiting to basically worship the goddess.

87
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But Artemis, the goddess whose temple Heraclitus sequesters himself to, is also originally an Iranian goddess, specifically worshipped by the Sarmatians. So Heraclitus is very clearly in the Iranian orbit spiritually.

88
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And so now we have a second major influence on Plato, who steeped in Iranian thought, Heraclitus.

89
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Let me just jump in for one second. Artemis has the subtitle, her name, her nickname, Luciferia. She is like the female aspect of Lucifer.

90
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So you have this, and we talked about this in Prometheus, this idea of the opposing viewpoint of these two different views on what God is or which God we should give our devotion to.

91
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And so here we are with this court with the goddess whose subtitle's name is Luciferia, and that's from Calimacus. I can show the sources if you guys want.

92
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'll add something esoteric that makes this even more striking. So the name Artemis, contrary to what some linguists have argued, doesn't really mean anything in Greek, but it means a hell of a lot in the original Old Iranian.

93
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And that's Arta Amesha. Arta Amesha means immortal truth. Arta meant truth in the sense of like logos, cosmic order.

94
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And so it's the undying cosmic order, which by the way was symbolized by fire. Heraclitus, fire becomes, you know, the metaphor for cosmic energy in his thinking.

95
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Arta Amesha means immortal truth in Old Iranian. And it's a, what do you call it? They say se fatin Persian. It's a quality. It's an epithet. It's a descriptor.

96
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:38,000
But the actual name of the deity that was worshiped by the Sarmatians, who is described as Arta Amesha or immortal truth was Satana or Shatana.

97
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Wow.

98
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So, and so I've always thought that, look, I mean, this culture, the Scythians invaded. The Scythians and Sarmatians are kindred cultures.

99
00:15:48,000 --> 00:16:03,000
In some cases, they're almost indistinguishable from one another. And they invaded the Middle East by at least 700 BC. And we know they got as far as the border of Palestine with Egypt.

100
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Okay. Or the border of Israel with Egypt. And so I've always thought that this reference Hashaytan in Hebrew actually is coming from the name of Shatana and was a demonization of this serpentine goddess figure of the Sarmatians who had, you know, serpents entwined around her and who was served by the Gorgons.

101
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The Gorgons were sort of goddess figures associated with this great goddess. And so in any case, there's a lot there, you know, behind Artemis and the figure that of course Heraclitus decided to devote himself to or rather at least take refuge in her in the sanctum of her temple, rather than accepting the invitation of Darius the Great.

102
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Anyway, we want an attention. My point was that Plato is influenced by at least two figures who are steeped in Iranian thinking Pythagoras and Heraclitus. So did you want to

103
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Well, okay, so I just want I'm glad we laid that out because I'm trying to show the setting in which we're in that leads up to the world that Plato so when we get to by the time we get to Plato.

104
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Plato is inch is he's initiated into the Pythagoreans. But we hear about him at his funeral. According to people who write about his field, leave us Aristotle, the Magi attended his funeral.

105
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So what, what is he, what is he?

106
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I got distracted. This was the third thing that I was going to mention is that I believe it is Aristotle, and this is reported on by Mary said aghast in her book, when Zarathustra spoke.

107
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:03,000
According to classical sources, the Magi attended Plato's funeral and they claimed he was a member of the order.

108
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Okay, now this doesn't mean that Plato was like a Zoroastrian or something. Okay, like this is a common misconceptions today. Order of the Magi, you know, I discussed this at length in Iranian Leviathan originally was a Mithraic order.

109
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And it was very esoteric. You know, it had incorporated various Babylonian and Assyrian beliefs into it and so forth child in astrology. And so it was a complex esoteric order.

110
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And just because Plato was a member of the order of the Magi, I didn't mean that he wasn't also a member of the Pythagorean order and also this and also that I mean, today, people who belong to Freemasonry tend to also belong to I don't know the Golden Dawn and any number of other esoteric societies.

111
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And so Plato was probably such a person in those days.

112
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
He said aghast initiated into seven different things.

113
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Yeah, but it's worth mentioning that, you know, Plato wanted to go to Persia after traveling to Italy and Egypt, never made it to Persia, but, you know, the Persian Empire extended into Greece into parts of Greece, and it appears at some point he was initiated into the order of the magi.

114
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And the magi considered him among their own.

115
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Okay, here's a good lead into the, you know, conversation that I really want to have.

116
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The most striking thing about Plato being a magus, a member of the order of the magi is his concept of the noble lie, because as Herodotus tells us and as we know directly from the compositions of Zarathustra, lying was considered the worst thing among the Persians and

117
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:01,000
well, I was going to say among Zarathustrians in particular but also in Mithra's early Mithra's Mithra's the God of Odes and contracts right this raising of the right hand that we have to this day.

118
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
This is a Mithraic oath.

119
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You know when you raise your right hand to supposedly tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth in court and so forth.

120
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And so how is Plato a member of the order of the magi and also someone who's advocating this concept of the noble lie.

121
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Now in Iranian Leviathan, I have a whole chapter called Emperor of Noble Lies which is about Darius the Great.

122
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And I showed that the understanding of truth that prevailed amongst the Mithraic initiates in Iran was a lot more complex than some simplistic idea of, you know, honesty to a fault, right.

123
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And, you know, so someone who wants to understand the nuances of the concept of truth and its relationship to strategic deception in an Iranian context should look at that chapter, Emperor of Noble Lies about Darius the Great in Iranian Leviathan.

124
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
But to bring the conversation back to Plato.

125
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:22,000
This essay pharmacon artist that I referenced at the outset, I argued that Plato's noble lie isn't simply one concept, or one strategy that he deploys as part of the larger edifice of his thought.

126
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Plato's entire philosophical project could be seen as a noble lie by his entire philosophical project I mean the elaboration of the so called theory of forms.

127
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So I make this really radical argument in the pharmacon artist.

128
00:21:40,000 --> 00:22:02,000
The highlights of which, you know, I'd like to discuss with you where my thesis is essentially that Plato didn't believe in the existence of the forms that he contrived this doctrine for the purposes of psychological and social engineering.

129
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And that his quote unquote unwritten doctrine which he confesses to having is one that is, let's say, deeper than or, yeah, let's say deeper than more profound than this exoteric theory of forms that he publicly disseminates and that becomes so seminal and pivotal in the history of western rationalism.

130
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
So that's the basic thesis that I forward in the essay the pharmacon artist.

131
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Now, that's interesting because in the dialogues that Plato gives us there's a really important dialogue called parminides, where he has the master of that time period was parminides.

132
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:05,000
But underneath parminides are these two up and coming sages that are his students, Socrates and Zeno.

133
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And Zeno is is he's he's a I guess you would say before the Epicureans he's sort of a not he's against the forms he's more of like an atomic Adams and void, but Socrates in the he has through the mouth of Socrates, he's arguing for forms and he wins the debate,

134
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
and he convinces parminides that forms is the is the real reality.

135
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And so is this part of this, he's setting up.

136
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Look, even the great master parminides believes in these forms.

137
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Is this what's happening.

138
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Right, so okay, parminides is among the most complex platonic dialogues.

139
00:23:44,000 --> 00:24:01,000
And in that dialogue parminides, and the dialogue called the sophist, where, you know, Plato is engaging in another one of his critiques of the kind of sophistry that prevailed in his time, where people would hire these tutors to basically teach them how to argue

140
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
anything regardless of whether they believed in it or not.

141
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
These two dialogues parminides and the sophist.

142
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Plato engages with the thought of parminides.

143
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And one of the keys in my argument, one of the key points in the thesis that I lay out in a pharmacon artist is that Plato makes a strong man, both of parminides and of heraclitus in order to develop the theory of forms right.

144
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So let me, yeah, since we're on parminides, let's let's go with that and then I'll come back to heraclitus.

145
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:57,000
In essence, what goes on in these two dialogues parminides and the sophist is that Plato feigns stupidity in the guise of Socrates his mouthpiece by

146
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:08,000
misinterpreting what parminides means by being in the sense of the one and by nothingness.

147
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Okay, so in the in his way of truth in parminides poem, the way of truth, the parminides was, let's see, about he flourished as they say in the Greek context he flourished around 475 BC.

148
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So we're talking about someone living a generation before Socrates and a couple of generations before Plato.

149
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And parminides is point in the way of truth is very similar to the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta.

150
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It's that the world of multiplicity and change is illusion.

151
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And really, the only existent thing is an absolutely unified, eternal and infinite one.

152
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:05,000
So if anything really exists, it has to be one thing of which nothing can really be predicated.

153
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And all of the specific characteristics that changing things have changing both in space and over the course of time, all the predicates and qualitative characteristics of changing things are really illusions.

154
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Okay, and so, you know, what we really are are sort of like facets of this infinite and eternal one.

155
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And we should strive by the power of our transcendental minds to apprehend our union, our, our, yeah, our identity with this transcendental one.

156
00:26:51,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And the leatics, the school of parminides would engage in various practices in order to initiate adherence into the mystery of this transcendental oneness, including the use of psychedelic drugs inside caves.

157
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:27,000
So, Plato, besides studying with Cratolus, who was a Heraclitian, Plato at one point studied with, I believe his name was Hermodorus, representative of the school of parminides.

158
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:46,000
So Plato is not getting his own, his only understanding of parminides through Socrates. Plato, prior to having written the parminides and the Sophists dialogues, studied under a leatic or, you know, parminidian teacher himself.

159
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And I, okay, so I cannot believe that what we see reflected in the dialogues parminides and Sophists represents Plato's actual understanding of parminides.

160
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Because basically, he argues that like parminides doesn't understand what non-being means.

161
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:22,000
That when parminides is saying, look, either you have to say that there's nothing at all, or you have to say that really everything that's in a state of, in a seeming state of change, and all of the multiplicity in the world is actually just a one, right?

162
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:33,000
When he sets up, Plato says that when, when parminides sets up this false binary in the way of truth, his poem, he's mistaking what non-being means.

163
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:46,000
When we say, you know, nothingness or the non-existent, we are just referring to something other than the present state of affairs. It's what we would call it like an indexical reference.

164
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So, you know, right now, you know, I'm not sitting in a taxi.

165
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So, you know, if I, if I say, you know, like, you know, my laptop on my lap in the taxi now, it's referring to some other state of affairs than the current state of affairs where I'm sitting in this room, right, in this, in this apartment.

166
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And so it's a counterfactual that we intend to indicate when we use not such and such, when we use a negation.

167
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:30,000
It's not some mysterious nothingness. This is what Plato is arguing in parminides on this office.

168
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And so basically what he's trying to parse out in these dialogues is what we mean when we refer to a true or false state of affairs with some kind of a logically constructed proposition.

169
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
He's trying to lay the groundwork for epistemology, for theory of knowledge.

170
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:04,000
But Plato, well, let's just say, would have to have been dim in order to believe that this is really what parminides was on about. Right.

171
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Clearly, Plato could have understood that by nothingness, parminides meant something like what Gotama Buddha means when he talks about shunyata, and that parminides is, you know, advocacy for an ontology of an absolutely perfect unified and

172
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:33,000
eternal being is similar to the argument of Advaita Vedanta adherence against what they consider Buddhist nihilism.

173
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:51,000
He would at least have had to have that level of understanding. And if you read the Platonic corpus and see the kind of sophistication of thought this man engages in and his flair for irony and sarcasm and the subtlety with which he writes, there's no way to me that that could have been lost on him.

174
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And also the numerous passages and various dialogues, especially Phaedrus and Symposium, where Plato reveals himself to be a profound mystic.

175
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:11,000
There's no way that he thought parminides was making this kind of a logical error. And yet he creates this straw man out of parminides.

176
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And the other part of the straw man is that he says that what parminides meant by the one is mistaken, that the one is sort of like what makes anything the particular thing that it is.

177
00:31:34,000 --> 00:32:02,000
It's like the what what makes a substance cohere as that particular thing that it is. It's not some, you know, mystical vague sort of, you know, oneness that encompasses all things because if there were a oneness that encompasses all things, then anything that you would predicate of that would contradict its essence as infinite and eternal.

178
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Right. Like, if you imagine if you imagine the oneness as some mystics have as a sphere that extends in all directions, well, you can't wrap your mind around the outer edges of that sphere without putting the sphere in a certain space in the context of a certain space.

179
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
There's something outside it.

180
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And once you admit that the sphere is inside a certain space, you also admit that it has spatial parts. You can think of the top of the sphere, the side of the sphere, the back of the sphere.

181
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So then there's a multiplicity spatially. And then, as you're thinking about the sphere, time is elapsing. So then you're thinking of the sphere as it was in state A, as opposed to state B and what it's going to be in state C.

182
00:32:46,000 --> 00:33:01,000
So the sphere winds up or say, you know, it's a rotating sphere, it winds up having temporal parts. So as soon as you have any coherent conception of this sphere of the one, it has both spatial and temporal parts.

183
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And anything that you predicate of its spatial and temporal parts contradicts the essence of infinity and eternity that's proper to this one.

184
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So this is the kind of argument that he engages in, right, in parmenides in this office.

185
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:37,000
And I think that it's making a straw man out of parmenides. Plato does something similar with Heraclitus. Okay, so Heraclitus is an incredibly sophisticated thinker.

186
00:33:37,000 --> 00:34:00,000
This guy, when he describes everything in the cosmos as an ever-changing fire, he is not using fire the way that Thales used water as a kind of element from out of which all other elements or things can be derived, right?

187
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:14,000
He had thinkers very early in the history of pre-socratic philosophy who took one or another element as fundamental. In the case of Thales, it was water and they derived everything else like earth and air and fire from out of it.

188
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:27,000
It's a huge mistake to think that that's what Heraclitus means by fire. If you want to understand what Heraclitus means by fire, look at what Werner Heisenberg says about him in physics and philosophy.

189
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:47,000
He's the greatest German scientist of the era of the Second World War, German physicist rather. Werner Heisenberg, one of the pioneers of quantum theory, writes about Heraclitus in physics and philosophy and says that how Heraclitus describes fire and its relationship with the psyche.

190
00:34:47,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And the way in which fire is a metaphor for the Logos, the order in the cosmos, and the relationship between the fire and the psyche to the mind of Werner Heisenberg was some kind of a precursor to the relationship between consciousness and quantum potential in quantum theory.

191
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:23,000
So that what Heraclitus means by fire is something like what we mean by quantum potential. You had these early atomists that thought the world was basically made up of marbles.

192
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Their metaphor for the fundamental stuff were something like the marbles the Greek children played with.

193
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:48,000
You had others who believed that some substance like water went through various changes of state and that all things arose, had their genesis in that manner.

194
00:35:48,000 --> 00:36:04,000
What Heraclitus is saying is that what everything is made up out of is a dynamic flux that can't be pinned down and that is never in a static state.

195
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:24,000
At no point you find it in a static state, it's something that's always inherently in a dynamic flux and that thing is integrally interconnected with consciousness or what Heraclitus calls psyche, suke.

196
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:39,000
The relationship between suke and this dynamic flux has a Logos to it, it has an order to it. It expresses certain teleology.

197
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:55,000
And this is very similar to what we eventually arrived at on the other side of atomism in the quantum theory that describes the collapse of the quantum wave potential by consciousness.

198
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So Heraclitus is so sophisticated in his ontological thinking that Werter Heisenberg I think rightly saw his understanding of the cosmic flux and its relationship to the mind as a precursor of quantum theory.

199
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And Heraclitus makes it very clear that he isn't saying there's no such thing as existence. In other words, it's not a view of pure becoming as opposed to being. It's that existence is always in a state of process and this process does have a kind of teleology to it.

200
00:37:40,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And so when Aristotle claims that Plato developed the theory of forms, because Heraclitians like Cradilus, Plato's teacher and his youth, thought that you couldn't know anything about things that are in a state of perpetual flux.

201
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:20,000
This is not credible. Okay, there's no way that Plato did not study Heraclitus for himself. There's no way that, you know, this book that we call the fragments today that used to be called On Nature isn't a book that Plato picked up and read for himself.

202
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:38,000
He probably poured over it for years. And as a student of the Heraclitian school. And so even if Cradilus was such an imbecile that he misunderstood Heraclitus so badly that he says, you know, Heraclitus shouldn't have said you can't step into the same river twice.

203
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:58,000
You can't even step into it once, because as your foot is going into the river, it's not the same river the waters keep flowing, right? Even if Cradilus was such an imbecile to believe that Heraclitus was advocating a view of such sheer becoming that, you know, you couldn't know anything about objects, right?

204
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:16,000
That, you know, knowledge was ruled out and that we were going to wind up in a state of like perpetual skepticism regarding everything. There's no way that Plato wouldn't have understood Heraclitus better than Cradilus himself did.

205
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Right. I mean, this is typical. Like you go to study a certain doctrine with some teacher. And that teacher is a lame representative of that school of thought. And you're introduced to that school of thought through the particular teacher.

206
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:39,000
But then you go and, you know, study the origins of that thought yourself, and you come to a better understanding of it than this person who, you know, gave you some introductory lessons.

207
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Sure.

208
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Concern. And so I have to believe that that's the case in terms of Plato's understanding of Heraclitus.

209
00:39:47,000 --> 00:40:01,000
And I argue that it is the case on the basis of all kinds of remarks that Plato makes in Cradilus and Theotetus in particular. There are two dialogues, dialogue named after the Heraclitian teacher.

210
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And another dialogue Theotetus in which, and you have to read my essay, pharmacon artist to really be able to see, you know, how I do this, but in which if you subtract the forms that Plato's setting forth, the account of the world that you're left with is a deep understanding of the teaching of Heraclitus.

211
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:41,000
So, so, so basically, you can see from in between the lines of Cradilus and Theotetus that Plato thought deeply about the doctrine of Heraclitus.

212
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:53,000
But then he wants to make this straw man from out of Heraclitus, the same straw man that Aristotle gives us when he says Plato studied with Cradilus.

213
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And he saw that if you have this view of all things in flux, knowledge is not possible. And so he came up with a theory of forms as a way to build an epistemology to build essentially what becomes the first theory of knowledge and the basis for science ultimately.

214
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Yeah.

215
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It requires making a straw man out of Heraclitus in order to do that, because see, essentially, essentially what Plato does is this he takes Heraclitus, and he turns them into this cardboard cut out, where everything is in a state of flux, we can't know anything about

216
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Heraclitus, right? And in fact, the mind is not stable enough and separate enough from the flux of nature for the subject to predicate anything of objects that have independent existence.

217
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:59,000
He turns this into the view of Heraclitus, right? So everything is flowing. You can't know anything about the dynamic fuses. That's, let's say, the material world, right?

218
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Matter is a dynamic fuses that you can't know anything about because it's always flowing. Then he makes a straw man out of Parmenides.

219
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Right.

220
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:27,000
And he said, okay, well, what can be salvaged from out of Parmenides is this idea of the one as what gives something enough coherence to be the particular thing that it is, namely, to make it a substance.

221
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And he says, instead of there being this one that's synonymous with infinite and eternal being, which would render the entire world of multiplicity and illusion, there is a multiplicity of ones.

222
00:42:44,000 --> 00:43:04,000
There's a multiplicity of unities. And this multiplicity of unities interacts with or interferes with nature in a state of flux in order to give us the objects of our perceptible world that we experience.

223
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:21,000
And here, the Pythagorean doctrine becomes significant because this multiplicity of ones, okay, that he's getting from Parmenides, he's adapting from out of Parmenides, it takes a mathematical form which he's getting from the Pythagorean order.

224
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:37,000
And remember Pythagoras quote unquote believed the world is made of number. That's an oversimplification but Pythagoras thought that the fundamental constructs of the physical world were geometric and mathematical in nature.

225
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:59,000
So Plato takes the oneness of the one of Parmenides, and he fuses it with the geometric quality of the fundamental nature of reality as Pythagoras elaborated it, and he creates these forms, which he compares to geometricians, geometers, templates.

226
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:12,000
The templates, the geometers work with templates. They use them in machine shops also, even back in ancient Greece, the templates that, you know, a craftsman technetist, the craftsman's work with.

227
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:25,000
And so you have these templates that each have absolute imperfect unity, right? So the form of the circle is not circular. The form of the circle isn't round.

228
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:40,000
And the form of heaviness isn't actually heavy. It doesn't weigh anything. Each of these forms is absolute. It's perfect. It's infinite and eternal in the same way as the one of Parmenides.

229
00:44:40,000 --> 00:45:02,000
The multiplicity of these, and they're of a geometric or mathematical nature, and these infinite and eternal forms interfere with the flux of pure matter, of Hewlett as a kind of dynamic energy, the fire of Heraclitus.

230
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And from out of this interference, you get the objects of our world, the things that we experience, right? And also the finitude of the human mind as shaped by experience in a human body.

231
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Okay, this is how basically Plato develops the theory of forms by taking a strawman Heraclitus and a strawman Parmenides and fusing them together, also drawing on the mathematical thinking of Pythagoras.

232
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:53,000
And I think the most complete form of this that you see in the Platonic corpus is in the dialogue Timaeus, Plato's dialogue Timaeus, where he talks about how the forms and matter, pure matter in a state of ceaseless flux and chaos,

233
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:05,000
basically, I don't want to say intermix, you know, but how they interact with each other in this void, in this chasm that he describes in Timaeus.

234
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:28,000
And from out of this chasm, this interaction of forms and matter and flux produces the multifarious objects of our experience, of which we can predicate things about which we can know things with reference to the eternal forms, right?

235
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:57,000
So our rational minds are of the same nature as these infinite and eternal forms. And although our minds are ensconced in souls that are further shaped by the conditions of our physical body, it's still possible for our minds to grasp and analyze the physical world in terms of these supposedly non physical forms.

236
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And that gives us the basis for, you know, episteme or what later comes to be framed as scientific knowledge about the world.

237
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Okay, I'm trying to show this in a way where we can like see the timeline, because if I'm not mistaken.

238
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Is it because, okay, Zeno, not Zeno, Parminides comes from what was a part of the Persian Empire, and which is modern day Turkey, he goes to Magna Graecia, which is Italy now, and was Pythagoras there before him?

239
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Does he, is he going to the Pythagorean?

240
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,000
So he, so he basically joins this Pythagorean movement happening in Magna Graecia.

241
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Parminides?

242
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Parminides?

243
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Yeah.

244
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Is that what happens?

245
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I haven't seen any evidence that he joined the Pythagorean order, but that's what I'm asking.

246
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Are they separate?

247
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I think it was first.

248
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Pythagoras is first.

249
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Parminides comes from, from the East, sets up with the same general area as Pythagoras, but they have two different schools.

250
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Now, is this where Heraclitus, is he learning from both of these people?

251
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Is he coming?

252
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Because I think Heraclitus, well, no, it's Heraclitus.

253
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Both of them.

254
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Right.

255
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
But I'm saying Heraclitus, where does he fit in between Pythagoras and Parminides?

256
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Is he one of their, is he part of one of those schools or is he a completely different school?

257
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Are these, are these three different schools?

258
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Different school, different school.

259
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
So we have three different schools.

260
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:37,000
At least the interesting thing is that Heraclitus hated Pythagoras.

261
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
They were both coming from out of the Persian Empire.

262
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I don't mean just geographically, right?

263
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Pythagoras studied for over a decade with the Magi, and then Heraclitus was invited by Darius to become the court philosopher of Iran.

264
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,000
So they're both coming from out of this Persian spiritual intellectual background.

265
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:01,000
And yet, Heraclitus hates Pythagoras and takes a few jabs at him in his fragments, where he basically says,

266
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Why, like, he's like, uh, charlatan who came up with some like new agey cosmopolitan.

267
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

268
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Just true though.

269
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Well, okay, so now I just want to lay that out.

270
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,000
We have these three schools that are all three of them seem to be somewhat tied to Persia.

271
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
They both come to Italy, or they all come to, um, oh no, I'm talking about those two.

272
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
And then Heraclitus has his own thing.

273
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Now Plato, who's coming a century and a half later after Socrates is learning about these schools, which, which are these other pre-Socratics.

274
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Now, so my question is this, this is very interesting what you're, what you're laying out because we have these three schools of thought.

275
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Is Plato trying to unify them?

276
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
What is, what is he trying?

277
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:56,000
And what is, what is his goal in, in, in like straw manning these brilliant thinkers?

278
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
What is he trying to do with these three schools of thought?

279
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Yeah, okay, this is really the question.

280
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Okay, this is really the question.

281
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:10,000
So in order to answer that, we need to step back and look at the world into which Plato was born.

282
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Okay, and the time, the time, you know, and society of these men that we've discussed so far.

283
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Homer is often misunderstood as a literary figure and as a poet in the contemporary sense.

284
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
That's not at all the case.

285
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:35,000
If you read the Iliad and the Odyssey, particularly the Iliad, which is believed to be actually older than the Odyssey.

286
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:42,000
And there's some question about whether the Odyssey, you know, the Iliad and the Odyssey were both oral traditions.

287
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:56,000
And this Homer, who at some point wrote them down, was a particular Bard who sort of codified what was for a long time before that century, before that an oral tradition.

288
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:16,000
But the world that's revealed by the Iliad and the Odyssey is one where basically people are the playthings of fate and, you know, are at the whim of the gods and don't have hardly a thought that's their own or a conscience of their own.

289
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:27,000
At any moment when someone, quote unquote, comes up with an idea in the Iliad, it's because some god suddenly came in and gave them a particular inspiration.

290
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Eros comes up with his bow and strikes you, now you're in love with somebody.

291
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Yeah, that's the idea.

292
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Or when Achilles is by anger.

293
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Or when Achilles is seized by anger.

294
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:44,000
When, you know, any passion that seizes a person is attributed to the influence of a certain god.

295
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:50,000
And they would hear these gods and sometimes they would see these gods.

296
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
And there's no sense of personal conscience.

297
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:08,000
All of the actions taken by the heroes or the villains in the Iliad are basically either dictates of one or another god or they reflect some deeply ingrained social custom and ritual.

298
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:21,000
We're dealing with a completely ritualistic society of custom and incredibly conservative traditional society wherein there was no distinction even between nature and culture.

299
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Right, like the same way that birds had certain habits, they had a certain way of life that was proper to them.

300
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:36,000
It was proper for women to be in the kitchen, you know, and to like take care of the domestic sphere.

301
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:43,000
That wasn't considered an aspect of a particular culture and the migratory patterns of birds are an aspect of nature.

302
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:50,000
The distinction between nature and culture is something that was defined by the first philosophers to begin with.

303
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
It didn't exist in the world of the Iliad.

304
00:52:53,000 --> 00:53:11,000
So all of these actions taken by various figures like Agamemnon and Achilles and so forth in the Homeric world are either based on what was expected customarily or they are, you know, they're things that the gods commanded.

305
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:19,000
There's no personal conscience or sense of free will even that would allow for conscientious action.

306
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:39,000
And the other important point is that the medium of the Homeric, let's call it whatever, sagas, the medium of the Homeric epics was something akin to rap music.

307
00:53:39,000 --> 00:54:04,000
It was recited and performed in a way where the temple and modality of the poetic performance was meant to sort of contagiously move the audience in a way where they embodied the message being delivered through the medium.

308
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
A book that's been written about this is Eric Havlock's Preface to Plato.

309
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:22,000
So I refer people to that Havlock's argument in Preface to Plato, where he's saying that we shouldn't think of Homer as poetry in anything like contemporary sense.

310
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:33,000
It's more like a cultural encyclopedia of like, for example, there's huge passages on ship building in the Iliad like how to build ships.

311
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,000
That knowledge was transmitted through this poetry quote unquote.

312
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Orphic and Homeric hymns are the predecessor of the internet.

313
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Would you agree with that statement?

314
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Well, there's something to that in the sense that the internet is becoming yet again a kind of highly mimetic medium.

315
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:13,000
The core idea in Eric Havlock's study, Preface to Plato, is the idea of mimesis or mimicry, action that's highly imitative in which there's no reflection.

316
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:29,000
So it's like highly imitative embodiment of the message being conveyed by a medium without any personal reflection or critical thought about it.

317
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:42,000
And so this is exactly what takes place today, let's say, with bad rap music, not the kind of rap music that occasionally has like thought-provoking messages to it or like revolutionary political rap, but like gangster rap.

318
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,000
You know, the old bling-bling gangster rap about money and cars and hose and etc. on whatever, right?

319
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:57,000
And the people who listen to this rap and you can see them like on subways and they're moving their bodies in a certain way as they listen to this rap.

320
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:04,000
The Bacchic revelers were like this. They were just full energy, full just going with it, just going hard.

321
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Like that was what, that would be the equivalent of what that rap is.

322
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Yeah, and so when you say the internet is like that, it's because in a way like we are being, we are being, how can I put it, barbarized or kind of like being reduced again to a kind of pre-rational,

323
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:30,000
pre-reflective state through the intense mimesis, the mimetic power of the internet, right?

324
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Okay, that's a whole critique that's a side conversation.

325
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:40,000
But point being, Plato was dealing with a society where that's what poetry is.

326
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:48,000
And this poetry is totally corrupting children with all kinds of stories about, you know, sadistic and manipulative gods like Zeus,

327
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:57,000
who use people as their playthings and engage in, you know, rape all the time on, you know, using various disguises.

328
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:06,000
And so he considered this totally deleterious to the development of the moral fiber of children.

329
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:12,000
And when he bans the poets in his republic, this is the kind of poetry he's talking about.

330
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
He's not talking about poetry in the contemporary sense.

331
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
He's very specifically taking aim at Homer.

332
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Okay, let me jump in for one second.

333
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Yeah.

334
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,000
This is about to, this question is about to lead up to, I know this is going to be the one.

335
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
This is going to be the question.

336
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
You're going to enjoy this question.

337
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Because in-

338
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Let's not forget the previous question.

339
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I'm still trying to come around answering, why did he make a straw man out of Parmenides and Heraklites?

340
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Okay, you know what?

341
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
You're right.

342
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Let's do that first.

343
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Go ahead.

344
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
But don't forget it.

345
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Nope.

346
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
No, I got a really good question that's going to follow up.

347
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:56,000
So, so here's the thing in the context of this culture of mimesis of, you know, unreflected imitation and the basically

348
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:02,000
unthinking absorption of traditional cultural values, right?

349
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:08,000
In what had for centuries been an oral culture.

350
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:19,000
These sages like Parmenides, Heraklites, Pythagoras are breaking out of that and they're teaching people to think for themselves.

351
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:25,000
But the people who they're teaching are an extremely minuscule elite.

352
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Okay.

353
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:36,000
And by elite, I don't necessarily just mean wealthy people, although that tended to be the class of people in the Pythagorean schools in Sicily, for example.

354
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:43,000
But they were teaching at the very least we can say a very rarefied spiritual elite.

355
00:58:43,000 --> 00:59:04,000
And so they had the luxury of engaging in very esoteric manners of expression, very cryptic and profoundly thought provoking formulations of the kind that you find in Heraklites and in Parmenides.

356
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
And in the school of Pythagoras, I mean, the guy didn't even write down anything.

357
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:14,000
It was, it was, it was, you know, not permitted at his time in his own time to write down his teaching.

358
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:26,000
And he had two grades of followers, at least one of which was in front of the curtain sitting at his feet and the others of which had to sit behind the curtain that separated him from them.

359
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
So Pythagoras is the original man by man behind the curtain.

360
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
That's where the expression comes from.

361
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Wow.

362
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:42,000
So point being, point being, these esoteric sages were not really changing the society of the time.

363
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:57,000
And in fact, when the Pythagorean order was in danger of reshaping the society of Sicily, when it started to have significant sociopolitical influence, the aristocrats riled up the mob and they set fire to the Pythagorean schools.

364
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
And this is how Pythagoras ultimately died himself.

365
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:10,000
He either died in the fire or from, you know, wounds that he sustained during the burning of the Pythagorean schools by the mobs of Sicily, who were riled up by aristocrats.

366
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:26,000
So Plato's look, and then of course, Plato sees how his own teacher Socrates is executed by the Democratic Assembly of Athens for provoking people to think for themselves and question authority and question customer tradition.

367
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:47,000
And so Plato realizes that it's not enough to express yourself in this esoteric and cryptic form and convey deep truths by that means the way that Heraclitus and Pythagoras, Heraclitus and Parmenides did.

368
01:00:47,000 --> 01:01:06,000
You have to build a theory of knowledge that you can institutionalize in an academy, which then becomes responsible for educating the youth, rather than allowing them to be corrupted by what they're absorbing through Homer, for example.

369
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Right.

370
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:13,000
And in point of fact, Plato does set up the first Academy.

371
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:26,000
But, you know, what we have to remember about Plato who sets up the first Academy is that before he met Socrates, he was an aspiring tragic poet.

372
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:34,000
He had written this tragedy that, you know, he was going to submit to a competition in the theater of Dionysus.

373
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:49,000
And the story is that after he heard Socrates talk, he burned his great tragedy in an offering to Prometheus.

374
01:01:49,000 --> 01:02:01,000
He calls forth the God of fire and burns his great tragedy that he was going to enter into this competition and all of the rest of the poetry he had written up to that point and decides to become a student of Socrates.

375
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Coming from the background of having been a tragic poet, and of course Dionysus is the God associated with tragedy, and then it's reputed that Plato when he died was discovered to have had a copy of Aristophanes' comedies under his pillow, which he slept on every night.

376
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Wow.

377
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
It's perfect to bed with him.

378
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:48,000
And when you look at the symposium toward the end of Plato's symposium, there's this conversation between Aristophanes, who appears as a character in that dialogue, and a representative of comedy, and Agathon, who's a tragedian, and Aristophanes and Agathon after everybody else has fallen to sleep they're all drunk and they're falling to sleep.

379
01:02:48,000 --> 01:03:03,000
They're all sprawled all over the floors. These two are the last ones awake. And as the dawn is rising, they're having a conversation about whether there could be a new form of art beyond the binary of tragedy and comedy.

380
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:23,000
And I think that this is what Plato wanted philosophy to be, that he's conceiving a philosophy as a new art form that embraces the best qualities of both the tragic view of the world that you see in like Heraclitus and comedy.

381
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
In other words,

382
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Is this where you get the satires from?

383
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
They try to merge the two together.

384
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Yeah, and okay.

385
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:47,000
In symposium, Alcibiades, who is this scandalous politician and disciple of Socrates, actually people say he was trying to become Socrates's lover.

386
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Alcibiades gives this eulogy of Socrates with the main ads all dancing around to the flute tunes of Dionysus. Okay, this is the backdrop.

387
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:09,000
As this Dionysian ritual is taking place and everyone's drinking and they're playing the Dionysian flutes and the main ads are all dancing around.

388
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Alcibiades gives us this eulogy of Socrates and he says Socrates is a, he is a trickster.

389
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:27,000
He is a pharmacus, a witch doctor who has brought us a pharmacon.

390
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:35,000
It was snake poison that was used by traditional doctors as a cure. So in the right amount, it's a medicine.

391
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:45,000
In successive doses, it will kill you. And he says he's been subjected to the venom of Socrates's poison and it's driven him mad.

392
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:56,000
And that Socrates deploys all these arguments in an apparently rational manner, but really what he's trying to do is drive a person toward a kind of divine madness.

393
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:05,000
And he admits to having been driven there himself by Socrates. And so we get this, why does Plato present this image of Socrates in Symposium?

394
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:18,000
And why in the same dialogue, does Socrates say that Eros is the only thing that he's ever understood and the only thing that he worships?

395
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Socrates says this in Symposium. Excuse me, what happened to the forums?

396
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Right.

397
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Right. So Diatima, he had this teacher, Socrates had this teacher, Diatima, who according to Plato and how he writes the Symposium, taught Socrates this great mystery of Eros as the ultimate enigma, the ultimate secret, right?

398
01:05:46,000 --> 01:06:03,000
You know, divine love, in the sense of the erotic, is somehow the ultimate key to wisdom, right? And essentially it's a Western form of Tantra, okay?

399
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
And

400
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:17,000
And he lays out how in every, he said, look at the stories of Homer, every time a character is in trouble, Eros comes, he strikes his bow and makes one of these lovely ladies fall in love with the hero and save them.

401
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Eros is always, he said Eros, according to Longus from this, from the novel Daphnis and Chloe, Eros has more power than Zeus himself.

402
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:37,000
He has the power over all the elements. That's like, what? What the hell is Socrates talking about?

403
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Yeah, and what happened to the forums? So look, if you go back to Plato's Republic, there are some rather cryptic remarks that he makes.

404
01:06:51,000 --> 01:07:00,000
This was my question. This was going to be my question because in Plato's Republic, he says, Homer's no good.

405
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Homer, no, no, no, no, no, no. Homer has Achilles in Hades crying. That can't be the, we cannot have this.

406
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:20,000
We need a cosmology where the good people go to heaven and experience eternal bliss and the bad people go to Hades, not Achilles going to Hades.

407
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:29,000
And so my question is, is Plato setting up the cosmology of Judeo-Christianity?

408
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Okay, so now I was going to go to Republic, but let me just make a brief assignment here that's relevant to how you frame this question.

409
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:49,000
In Phaedo, the death dialogue, the dialogue where Socrates drinks the hemlock and martyrs himself.

410
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Socrates' disciples are all around him, his friends, his friends are surrounding him.

411
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:13,000
And he says that he tells them they shouldn't worry because he's going to a place where he's going to be surrounded by all the best men, essentially an afterlife populated by the virtuous.

412
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:23,000
And lays out, as you put it yourself, a kind of prototype for the Christian vision of heaven.

413
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:33,000
And he basically, how is this set up? Let me actually read you the passage because it's quite striking.

414
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:44,000
This friend or disciple of Socrates as Sebes says to him,

415
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Probably even in us, there is a little boy who has these childish terrors, try to persuade him not to be afraid of death as though it were a bogey.

416
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:05,000
What you should do, said Socrates, is to say a magic spell over him every day until you have charmed his fears away.

417
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:13,000
But Socrates said, Simeos, where shall we find a magician who understands these spells now that you are leaving us?

418
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Okay, that's when they're imploring him to console them about his dying, right?

419
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:30,000
To reassure them that he's going to a better place and that they shouldn't, you know, excessively mourn his death.

420
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:36,000
And so then Socrates comes back with, he comes back with, quote,

421
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:46,000
If I did not expect to enter the company first of otherwise than good gods and secondly of men now dead who are better than those who are in this world now,

422
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,000
it is true that it would be unjust for me not to grieve at death.

423
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:56,000
As it is, you can be assured that I expect to find myself among good men.

424
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:06,000
While I would not particularly insist on this, I assure you that I could commit myself upon this point if I could upon anything.

425
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
One more time.

426
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:19,000
While I would not particularly insist on this, I assure you that I could commit myself upon this point if I could upon anything, unquote.

427
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
All right.

428
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
This is a disaster.

429
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
And I'm going to tell you why.

430
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:33,000
First of all, in the same dialogue, Phaedo, this is these quotes were from Phaedo in the same dialogue.

431
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Socrates says, Plato, of course, in the mouth of Socrates says that we can't have any true knowledge while we're inside the body.

432
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:53,000
That we can only have approximate knowledge and that true knowledge can only be attained through total freedom from the senses.

433
01:10:53,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Objective absolute knowledge can only be attained when our mind has been freed from our body and it's distorted perception of things and we're able to perceive sort of like as if from the vantage point of the realm of forms.

434
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Okay.

435
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:25,000
But he's presenting a vision of the afterlife where that's not the case. When he wants to reassure his disciples, he's presenting like what becomes the classic sensuous afterlife of, let's say, Christianity.

436
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
My faith, right.

437
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
My faith.

438
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:37,000
And that's, in that state, you have what's called a soma pneumaticon. That's what the Greeks called this, the spectral body, soma pneumaticon.

439
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:42,000
It is a world where you still have perception and you still have sensations even.

440
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Now, here's a further problem. This heavenly afterlife that he presents us with in Phaedo contradicts what he writes in Republic in the myth of error.

441
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:12,000
In the myth of the story of this soldier error myth of myth is not the right word in this tale of error in Republic were presented with basically like what we call today an NDE a near death experience account where this guy air sort of dies and lives to tell the

442
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:24,000
tale comes back and lives to tell the tale of what the afterlife is like what is the transition between death and rebirth life because of course Plato argues in favor of reincarnation.

443
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:37,000
The or the orifics use this as the secret, the secret knowledge of what to do when you go to Hades and how to reincarnate the right way and keep your memory.

444
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Yes.

445
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Plato studied all these things, right? So, but the thing is this, the story of error portrays a kind of afterlife transition between death and rebirth.

446
01:12:51,000 --> 01:13:05,000
That's actually very similar to what we see in the Tibetan book of the dead, the Mahayana Buddhist account of the bardo state, and it is not the same as what Plato says to reassure his disciples in the Phaedo.

447
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
They conflict with each other.

448
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Absolutely.

449
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:21,000
And the account of the Phaedo conflicts with what Plato says about knowledge only being possible once we free our mind entirely from the senses, because the bardo state or the state of the soma pneumaticon is still a sensuous state.

450
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
And so this stuff doesn't make sense.

451
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Okay.

452
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
No.

453
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
And the guy obviously not a moron.

454
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
He's not contradicting himself.

455
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,000
He's saying these apparently contradictory things for a reason.

456
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Let me present one more.

457
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Yeah, no.

458
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:44,000
And everything you're saying is this is what I've been wondering about Plato, since I've been reading about it, like what is going on with Plato.

459
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
And it seems that he's changing.

460
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:52,000
He wants to change the norms of what people think about reality and the afterlife.

461
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Go ahead.

462
01:13:53,000 --> 01:14:02,000
So one more point that's relevant to this death scene to, you know, the account that we get in Phaedo of Socrates's last days.

463
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:10,000
His disciples show up and they see him writing poems based on Aesop's fables.

464
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:16,000
These animal stories, the animal stories with the moral about donkeys and things.

465
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Yeah.

466
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:25,000
And he's sitting there in his last days writing poems based on Aesop's fables and they ask him basically like, what are you smoking?

467
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Like what?

468
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Have you lost your mind, Socrates?

469
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Like what are you doing, man?

470
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
This is how you're spending your last days.

471
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
And this is what Socrates says in reply.

472
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
He says, quote.

473
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Now let's keep in mind, right?

474
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Now this is the Plato who's writing this is the guy who in Republic has claimed that the poets should be banned.

475
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Right.

476
01:14:48,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Because they're corrupting the morals of the youth and he thinks there should be very narrow like limits on like what kind of poetic compositions there are for the sake of edification and inculcation of virtue in the.

477
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,000
This is the guy who's writing what I'm about to read.

478
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:12,000
He goes, Socrates says to his disciples who are wondering if he's lost his marbles, versifying Aesop quote.

479
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,000
I did not compose the poetry to rival either Evanus or his poetry.

480
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I did it in the attempt to discover the meaning of certain dreams and to clear my conscience in case this was the art which I had been told to practice.

481
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:38,000
It's like this, you see, in the course of my life, I've often had the same dream appearing in different forms at different times, but always saying the same thing.

482
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Socrates practice and cultivate music, the arts in the sense of poetry, music, Socrates make music.

483
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:58,000
In the past, I used to think that it was impelling and exhorting me to do what I was actually doing.

484
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I mean that the dream like a spectator encouraging a runner in a race was urging me on to do what I was doing already.

485
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:11,000
That is practicing the arts because philosophy is the greatest of the arts and I was practicing it.

486
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:21,000
But when my trial had taken place and this God's festival was delaying my execution, I decided that in case it should be this popular form of art.

487
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
That the dream intended me to practice.

488
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
I ought to compose and not disobey.

489
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:31,000
I reflected that a poet ought to work on stories, not discourses.

490
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
And I was no story writer.

491
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,000
So it was the stories that I knew and had handy which I versified.

492
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Asops, the first ones that occurred to me.

493
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Okay, this is a diabolical writer.

494
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Yeah.

495
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,000
What is he telling us here?

496
01:16:52,000 --> 01:17:10,000
He's telling us something about the relationship between the Dionysian essence of the poetic and the kind of art that Plato sought to produce in his youth as a tragedian on the one hand.

497
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:21,000
And the Apollonian rationalism of what becomes Plato's philosophical project on the other hand as exemplified by the theory of forms.

498
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:28,000
And the same Socrates who's telling us this ridiculous and unbelievable thing.

499
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Namely that, oops, maybe I was supposed to like, versify children's stories and animal fables instead of doing philosophy.

500
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Maybe that's what this voice, this daemon was telling me all my life that I should make music.

501
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Right. And I did, I wasted my whole life. So I make up for it by making poems of, you know, animal fables that I read in childhood.

502
01:17:53,000 --> 01:18:03,000
No, no. So this ridiculous story is really another way that Plato is signaling the fact that there's an esoteric and unwritten doctrine here.

503
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:11,000
That when Socrates says in symposium, the only thing I've ever understood and that I've devoted myself to worship in life is Eros.

504
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Again, Dionysian power, right.

505
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:32,000
And so now where I was going to go before, and I think there's a good time to loop back around to it, is these passages in Republic where Plato is comparing the forms to the diagrams drawn by geometers.

506
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:41,000
And so look, according to the conventional understanding of the theory of forms, you obviously can't see forms, right.

507
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:54,000
So you can, no matter how perfect the circle you draw is, it's not a representation of the form of the circle, nor is a perfect triangle, the form of the triangle, right.

508
01:18:54,000 --> 01:19:08,000
The geometric diagrams that are drawn on blackboards or whatever, or these days that are formulated by computer code are not the form of that geometrical object.

509
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:17,000
I mean, if you zoom in enough on what appears to be a perfect triangle generated by a computer, it's going to pixelate at some point.

510
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Okay, even if you were to print out what appears to be a perfect triangle using individual atoms, right, in molecular nanotechnology, if you use an electron microscope, it's going to also pixelate.

511
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:43,000
So nothing we can craft in this world will represent the perfect circle or the perfect triangle or the perfect square or whatever, right.

512
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Isn't that debunked, you know?

513
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Well, no, but here's the thing, right, Plato claims that the forms exist in this invisible realm, right, that they're beyond the physical world.

514
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
But here's the thing, I don't think he really believes that.

515
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
No, me neither.

516
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:09,000
There are passages in Republic where he compares the invisible forms to the diagrams drawn by geometers.

517
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Okay, try to grasp this point, just a little bit of a subtle point.

518
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:18,000
So the diagrams drawn by geometers can never represent forms.

519
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,000
They're infinite, they're eternal, they exist in this realm beyond the physical world.

520
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:34,000
So Plato shouldn't be comparing forms, the real forms, the transcendental forms, to the diagrams drawn by geometers, but he does do this.

521
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
He does do this in Republic.

522
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I'll give you the passage in a minute.

523
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Let me lay it out.

524
01:20:40,000 --> 01:21:02,000
And what he says is that these forms are meant, like the diagrams used by geometers, to act as step ladders in order to help us intellectually grasp or spiritually grasp with our mind's eye, the form of the good.

525
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:30,000
So all the other forms are simply step ladders or useful tools like geometers diagrams to help us grasp the form of the good, the way that geometers use the drawing of a circle on a board to help someone understand what a circle is as an abstract definition.

526
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:45,000
And with equal significance, Plato says, I was afraid that if I, and he said, okay, so that was Republic, what I just laid out there, and I'll give you the passage numbers in a minute.

527
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:58,000
And then in Phaedo, he says that I was afraid that if I contemplated the form of the good directly, I would go blind the way someone who looks into the sun does.

528
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:08,000
And so I took refuge in the realm of ideas, or and so I took recourse to ideas, meaning the forms.

529
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Right.

530
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,000
So what are these forms then?

531
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Are they constructs that are meant to help you not go blind intellectually and spiritually? And what's the relationship between that looking straight into the sun and the madness that Plato talks about in Phaedrus and that

532
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Alcibiades accuses Socrates of having driven him to in symposium, the divine madness.

533
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Okay.

534
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:49,000
So let me just take a moment to give some references here.

535
01:22:49,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Geometers diagrams that I was talking about, that's in Republic 510 to 511c, 510c to 511c, where he's saying that all the other forms are there only so that you can contemplate the form of the good, and they're like tools, they're like geometers diagrams.

536
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:26,000
And then the passage where he says that he was afraid he'd go blind by staring straight into the sun if he contemplated the form of the good directly, that's in Phaedo 99d to 100a, Phaedo 99d to 100a.

537
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Specifically he says, quote, I thought that in the contemplation of true existence, I ought to be careful that I did not lose the eye of my soul.

538
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:45,000
People may injure their bodily eye by observing and gazing on the sun during an eclipse, unless they take the precaution of only looking at the image reflected in the water, or in some analogous medium.

539
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:57,000
I was afraid that my soul might be blinded altogether if I looked at things with my eyes, and I thought that I had better have recourse to the world of idea and seek there the truth of things.

540
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Okay, the world of idea, meaning the realm of forms.

541
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Now I want to look at two really important letters that Plato wrote.

542
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:16,000
One is the seventh letter.

543
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,000
These are, they're referred to as Plato's epistles, the letters that Plato wrote to various people.

544
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:34,000
One is the seventh letter, and one is the second letter, and significantly the second letter, Plato's second letter, is a letter that he wrote to Dionysus II of Syracuse.

545
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Oh my God, this is going to lead up to another good question, go ahead.

546
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Doesn't he try to kill Plato later? Plutarch writes a story.

547
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:49,000
It's one of the tyrants of Sicily or Syracuse tries to kill Plato, and then Plato had to get out of there by the squire.

548
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Yes, I thought you said sure. No, yes, kill. No, no, no. It's a disaster.

549
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:05,000
So, okay, so Plato, this is also a really important point to grasp in terms of the philosopher living his ideas.

550
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:13,000
The philosopher, as someone who doesn't just sit in an ivory tower but wants to change the world, okay, wants his ideas to reshape society.

551
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Plato attempted to implement his conception of the ideal society.

552
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:36,000
He went to Syracuse in contemporary Italy, southern Italy, and he attempted through a follower of his in the court of Dionysus the Elder, Dionysus I.

553
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:49,000
A guy named Dion, who was part of the family of Dionysus, was a follower of Plato, and this Dion gave him basically Plato a foothold in the royal court of Syracuse.

554
01:25:49,000 --> 01:26:06,000
And Plato tried to influence the son of Dionysus to not be a tyrant like his father and basically mold him into the type of philosopher king that he portrays in Republic.

555
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:18,000
And long story short, Dionysus gets rubbed the wrong way by this and his courtiers convince him that Plato is out to wreck the conservative traditional society of Syracuse.

556
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:23,000
And he has Plato sold into slavery.

557
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:31,000
And some rich guy bails Plato out basically and buys his freedom and Plato escapes back to Athens.

558
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Then Dionysus dies, Dionysus I dies, and Dionysus II comes to power and Dion, who is his uncle, Dion is the uncle of Dionysus II, he winds up with more influence.

559
01:26:47,000 --> 01:27:02,000
He winds up with more influence at court. And so he basically implores Plato to come back and try again. And Plato comes back and he tries again now to shape Dionysus II, a monarch who's actually on the throne.

560
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:12,000
And the second letter is a letter to this Dionysus II of Syracuse, which Plato writes to him after Plato is forced to flee again.

561
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:17,000
And so Plato is forced, you know, at the risk of his life to flee for a second time.

562
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Yeah, Soothark says that I think it was the second Dionysus who wanted to kill Plato and almost did, was very close to doing it.

563
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Yes. And then, get this, he repents at some years later, Dionysus II has a change of heart, and he convinces Dion to beg Plato to come back for a third time to Syracuse.

564
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:47,000
You know, he agrees he's gonna let Plato basically experiment in Syracuse with his ideas for social engineering and so forth.

565
01:27:47,000 --> 01:28:02,000
And it ends badly for a third time. And the third time, as Dionysus II basically, you know, conspires to execute both Plato and Dion.

566
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Dion leads a coup d'etat against the government of his nephew and tries to take power directly, basically as a representative of Plato's philosophical project.

567
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:20,000
And Dion is killed in the process and Plato has to escape Syracuse, you know, for the third time. Right.

568
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,000
So he, he, this is very important.

569
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:29,000
This is the same geographical location where Parminides and Pythagoras and all these guys are.

570
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:40,000
So this is this is a huge stick for what for the Western, the Western civilization, like all these events are shaping the world today in a weird way in the rival effect way. Yeah.

571
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:48,000
But no, this is really important in terms of understanding the concept of the noble lie.

572
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:59,000
This is an idea that that Plato brings up in, I'm going to come back to the letters I know we're going on a tangent but it's still relevant to setting this up.

573
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:09,000
What Plato's misadventure in Syracuse is very important to understanding the noble lie as an applicable concept.

574
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Before 14 to 415 in Republic, Plato introduces this idea of an ally that would be noble, a deception that would be, you know, that would be of merit and would have, you know, that would be virtuous a virtuous deception.

575
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Okay.

576
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:31,000
He introduces this idea at 414 to 415.

577
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:48,000
This is a mix of the so called myth of metals where he's saying that, you know, we have this tripartite society with the guardians or the philosopher rulers at the top, the military class of basically, you know, noble minded nights in the middle,

578
01:29:48,000 --> 01:30:05,000
the general citizenry of farmers and business people in the third tier. And he's saying that as part of getting people to accept this type of structure in society, which is of course a meritocratic structure because people are educated.

579
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:21,000
They all receive the same general education and it's throughout the course of their education that it's determined which class of society they belong in. But as part of getting people to accept this kind of meritocratic tripartite class division of society will inculcate them from

580
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:26,000
childhood with the myth that the gods have mixed one or another metal into their soul.

581
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:43,000
And the philosopher rulers have gold mixed into their soul. The noble warrior cast has silver mixed into its soul and the general populace of farmers and merchants have grown.

582
01:30:43,000 --> 01:31:02,000
And so that's the context in which introduced. So in other words, this is bullshit. Okay, it's a lie. It's some myth, but children should be brought up with this myth because it's constructive to reinforcing what is actually a noble attempt to replace the arbitrary

583
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:19,000
aristocracy and kind of quasi feudal society of the time with a meritocratic system right so it's serving to actually reward individuals for their merit as expressed through their performance in the course of their education.

584
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:36,000
So that's what makes it a noble lie. And then this noble lie comes up two more times. Once in the context of how marriages will be set up with the view to eugenic breeding.

585
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:57,000
So, okay, so in the Republic, the philosopher rulers and the military class are all married to each other. They have kind of a common marriage. It's like a basically free love. Okay, people and the men and women in the ruling class, and the men and women who serve as soldiers basically have a communal life where

586
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:13,000
they're all sleeping with one another. The general populace though have, you know, have marriages and have families, but the marriages are arranged with a view to eugenic breeding in other words the people with the best genes should be the ones who get together in order to produce

587
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:24,000
one free from diseases and deformities and so forth and the brightest children and so forth. Plato is the father of the concept of eugenics, but he says to make this go down easier.

588
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:36,000
We'll tell the general populace that like, you know, we're going to hold certain lotteries that determine who they get to marry what group of people are their eligible mates.

589
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:51,000
And this is the second application of the noble lie in service of the eugenic breeding program. The third and final example of the noble lie is the most important though, and the most relevant to our general conversation.

590
01:32:51,000 --> 01:33:02,000
And that's where Plato says, again, going back to his attack on Homer, and how all the sadism and brutality in the Iliad, for example, is deleterious to the development of the youth.

591
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Plato says that, look, these religious myths that we have are ancient and we don't know whether what they're depicting is something that ever really took place.

592
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:43,000
We have little knowledge of vast antiquity. And so we should spin these myths. We should rewrite them in ways that are more constructive to the development of the youth and frame a religion that portrays gods and goddesses and so forth in a way that will serve as an ethical example for the children brought up with this religion.

593
01:33:43,000 --> 01:34:00,000
And the guardians, the philosopher rulers don't have to believe in this religion. It's not true, but it's constructive for developing a society oriented toward actual discovery of the truth.

594
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,000
In other words, a society where science can flourish.

595
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Okay, so now you got to understand, we're dealing now with an incredibly duplicitous person. This person is proposing restructuring the entire religion of the society based on lies and creating a false religion which the rulers themselves won't believe in, but which they'll get the majority of the population to believe in,

596
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:43,000
because that type of religion that I don't want to call it a cult, will actually foster scientific thinking in the long run, and will be more conducive to the development of reflective, critical and strong individuals, which seems a little paradoxical, right?

597
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:58,000
But it's the idea that you have to force people to be free. And on the way to doing that, on the way to forcing people to think for themselves, you need to give them certain constructive fables, myths, right?

598
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:13,000
And ideas that may be false, but that will be thought provoking and that will be, that will cultivate virtue in them. Okay.

599
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:25,000
So, so these are the different, you know, examples of the use of the noble lie and, as I said at the beginning, what I'm suggesting is that this entire theory of forms is itself a noble lie.

600
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:40,000
And to get back to that argument, right, we were talking about, you know, the sun, which if you stare straight at, and by the way, the metaphor of a sun that never sets is at the heart of the writings of Heraclitus.

601
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:53,000
So I think the Plato is getting the simile of the sun straight from out of his years as a Heraclitian in his youth. And in the context of this whole discussion of how,

602
01:35:53,000 --> 01:36:08,000
unless you're ready for it, contemplating the good, the form of the good can blind you intellectually, it can drive you mad spiritually, right? And so you need something like the forms as a sort of safety net on the way to that.

603
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:21,000
In the context of all of that, let me read what Plato says in some key passages of these two letters, the seventh letter and the second letter, the one to Dionysus of Syracuse.

604
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:26,000
In the seventh letter, Plato writes,

605
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:41,000
This much at any rate I can affirm about any present or future writers who pretend to knowledge of the matters with which I concern myself, whether they claim to have been taught by me or by a third party, or to have discovered the truth for themselves.

606
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:53,000
In my judgment, it is impossible that they should have any understanding of the subject. No treatise by me concerning it exists or ever will exist.

607
01:36:53,000 --> 01:37:07,000
If I thought that any adequate spoken or written account could be given to the world at large, what more glorious life work could I have undertaken than to put into writing what would be of great benefit to mankind and to bring the nature of reality to light for all to see.

608
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:19,000
But I do not think that the attempt to put these matters into words would be to men's advantage, except to those few who can find out the truth for themselves with a little guidance.

609
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:29,000
That is why any students of serious realities will shrink from making truth the helpless object of men's ill will by committing it to writing.

610
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:49,000
In a word, the conclusion to be drawn is this, when one sees a written composition, whether it be on law by a legislator or on any other subject, one can be sure if the writer, if the writer is a serious man, that his book does not represent his most serious thoughts.

611
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:54,000
They remain stored up in the noblest region of his personality.

612
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:04,000
And now one short passage from the second letter, his letter to Dionysus II of Syracuse.

613
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Quote, take precautions, lest this teaching ever be disclosed among untrained people. It is impossible for what is written not to be disclosed.

614
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:26,000
That is the reason why I have never written anything about these things and why there is not and will not be any written work of Plato's own.

615
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Farewell and believe. Read this letter now at once many times and burn it.

616
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Wow.

617
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:41,000
So Plato never wrote his philosophy.

618
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:54,000
All these writings we have, the most voluminous intellectual work that survived the destruction of the Library of Alexandria and so forth, the corpus of Plato does not represent the teaching of Plato.

619
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:58,000
What Plato wrote were plays.

620
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:15,000
He was a tragedian. He was a trained playwright. Remember, he burned his plays when he met Socrates. He torched them and dedicated the burning of his plays to Prometheus and called for the God of Fire to inspire him in his next endeavor, which is his philosophical project.

621
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:43,000
But he did that at the theater of Dionysus and as someone who's coming from out of the Dionysian tragic poetic tradition, a tradition of ecstasy, of mystical frenzy, right, of the contemplation of beauty as the key to understanding the nature of the divine.

622
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:57,000
And so I think that Plato's unwritten doctrine, which he tells us exists, right, in the seventh letter and in the second letter, he says his true teaching remains unwritten.

623
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:06,000
So meaning what meaning we have to read between the lines of the dialogues that we want to understand, you know, what Plato actually thought.

624
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:22,000
And we have to read between the lines to understand what the hell Plato was trying to do in Syracuse or why Plato thought that noble lies needed to be employed for the sake of reshaping society beneficent.

625
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Okay, so this is what I argue in the pharmacon artist that Plato and of course the name of that essay is a play on words right pharmacon, it's the snake poison.

626
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:45,000
That's also a medicine in the right dose, which is what Socrates is accused of dispensing is being accused of being a pharmacus. But obviously my title the pharmacon artist has con artist in it.

627
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Oh, nice, nice.

628
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:57,000
He's a, and in a way I mean Alcibiades accuses Socrates of being a con man in symposium. Why would Plato write that.

629
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:14,000
He builds up this character, this great tragic martyr, seeker of truth in light, and he allows Alcibiades he gives him the stage with the main ads playing the Dionysian flute tunes in symposium to portray Socrates as a kind of

630
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:33,000
trickster con man, you know, basically magician, which doctor, right, because Plato is telling us something about himself, and who and what he really is, what he's up to.

631
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Wow.

632
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Now, when Plato talks about how what you want for a society is that you want them to think that their laws are not only divinely from God, but that they're most ancient and they go back to the beginning of time.

633
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:57,000
And when you weigh this up with what is being said.

634
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:07,000
And for example, the Old Testament, and there are there are some people who now are theorizing that the Septuagint came first, and the Hebrews came, regardless if that's true or not.

635
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Even if it's even if it's not true, there could be the other and the other side that could be that this Old Testament myth fits so well with what Plato envisioned that the people in Alexandria said this is let's put this together as this Septuagint.

636
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:37,000
That's how Lamaic Empire, that is Greek, obviously, and they have the libraries and they have Plato's writings. Are they putting together what becomes the myth of the Western civilization as we know it Judeo Christianity.

637
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:41,000
That's the question I think is Plato the one who checks this.

638
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:54,000
I don't know. I don't know if you realize the profundity and

639
01:42:54,000 --> 01:43:01,000
terror implicit in the question that you just framed. I mean,

640
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:14,000
this is perhaps the single most disturbing question that we could grapple with about the history of Western civilization and by extension the entire world has been conquered and dominated by the West.

641
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Let me just stop for a second. All the hours of us talking as leading up to this question right here. It literally has been and this is this is like the question that Plato construct what we what became the myth of the West, the religion of the Western civilization as we know it, you know, universal church.

642
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,000
So, okay.

643
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:57,000
I answered this question, not in the pharmacon artist, although you know I'm developing an embryonic phase of it there I'm planting the seeds for it there, but I answered this question of yours at the heart of Iranian Leviathan.

644
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:12,000
In the series of chapters that goes from the one I mentioned earlier Emperor of noble lies, where I'm portraying Darius the Great as a noble liar in the style of the Platonic philosopher King, all the way through.

645
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Hassan Sabah, the leader of the Order of Assassins at Alamut Fortress, claiming that nothing is true and everything is permitted, and that the entire war on with it so not its Sharia law was a noble lie.

646
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Okay, in this series of chapters in Iranian Leviathan, I basic which includes a treatment of the origin of the Old Testament.

647
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:59,000
You're the influence of Mithraists, who were the patrons of Jewish Pharisees that set up the Second Temple State after Cyrus and Darius rebuilt the Temple of Solomon.

648
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Okay, I have a whole treatment of that.

649
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:06,000
That chapter is comically titled Tekel Tekel Manish Ekel.

650
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:11,000
And it's about the relationship between the Persians and the Jews.

651
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,000
And how Judaism was created and why.

652
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:20,000
And you also have so many commonalities between the Mithraic Orders and the early Christians.

653
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,000
So much.

654
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
They're even using the same worship places.

655
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Right.

656
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:29,000
So now, look, this is like a whole other conversation.

657
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,000
This could be, yeah.

658
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Okay.

659
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:42,000
But in a nutshell, the answer to your question is that a case can be made

660
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:55,000
that people who understood very well what Plato's esoteric project was and people who knew how to deploy, noble lies in the most sophisticated way on the highest level or at the deepest level.

661
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,000
If you want to put it that way.

662
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:14,000
He engineered the Abrahamic revelation, the biblical religion as a catalyst for the transformation of society.

663
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:26,000
But the catalyst was not intended to get people to become good Jews or later good Christians or even later good Muslims.

664
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:33,000
The catalyst was intended to get people to go to the devil.

665
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:47,000
The purpose of the catalyst was to confront people with an image of divinity that ought to be rejected and resisted by the conscience of the human individual.

666
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Wow.

667
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,000
It was a pharmacon.

668
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Remember, pharmacon, it's poison.

669
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,000
If you don't take to it the right way, it will kill you.

670
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:02,000
It's a snake bite, like the snake in the garden of Eden.

671
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Why would you tell a story like that, by the way?

672
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:16,000
If your point is to get people to believe in Yahweh, why do you even have the whole narrative of the serpent offering the fruit of the tree of knowledge to Adamic man?

673
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Why?

674
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Why even include the story about the fallen angels and how they taught humanity to rebel against the Elohim?

675
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Why even have the Tower of Babel in there?

676
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:37,000
I mean, if you just want to instill paternalistic, patriarchal, collectivistic obedience into a society right like Confucius,

677
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:42,000
don't tell us about this serpent and about these rebel angels and about this Tower of Babel.

678
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
What are you trying to do here?

679
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Instigate rebellion.

680
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Give people models of challenging authority.

681
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
That's very Plato.

682
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Wow.

683
01:47:53,000 --> 01:48:08,000
My view is very radically divergent from the common understanding of the relationship between both Christian scholasticism and Plato,

684
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:21,000
and then later Islamic scholasticism and Plato, because Plato was as important to the medieval Muslim thinkers as he was to the Catholic scholastics.

685
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Conventionally, it's believed, and even Nietzsche subscribed to this idea, that Christianity is Platonism for the masses,

686
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:49,000
and that the scholastics Aquinas before him, Augustine and so on and so forth, they basically adapted elements of Plato into aspects of the Christian faith by making them more amenable to a popular understanding.

687
01:48:49,000 --> 01:49:00,000
But what you just did is you just answered the question that scholars have been dumbfounded by is that is the closer we get to the origins of Christianity,

688
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:08,000
the closer we get to the beginning, the more diverse it is, the more nostics there are, the more opposing there are.

689
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:14,000
There are people who literally say that Yahweh is evil and that Cain was good because he wasn't offering blood sacrifices.

690
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:23,000
They start off that way. They don't become that way later on. They start off that way, because you're seeing the duality within the stories.

691
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:26,000
You choose a side. You're choosing a side.

692
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
And so I believe it's a travesty.

693
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,000
You're right, dude.

694
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:36,000
And the Christian scholastics took to frame Plato as quote, a virtuous pagan, unquote.

695
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Like, he would have been a Christian if he were alive today.

696
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
No, no.

697
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Plato is out to create the devil.

698
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
That's his aim.

699
01:49:49,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Plato wants to, he wants to basically promulgate Diabolane, what the Greeks call Diabolane, a dynamic tension, a throwing through of opposites.

700
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
This is what his dialectical method is about.

701
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:17,000
It's why his dialogue, it's why he wrote dialogues and it's why his writings are structured in the conversational and oppositional way that they are.

702
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Because he wants people to set positions against one another.

703
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:34,000
He assumes all kinds of positions through the mouth of Socrates that he himself doesn't subscribe to and that over the course of his corpus contradict each other.

704
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:42,000
And he does that for the sake of provoking insight and catalyzing independent thinking.

705
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:47,000
He's literally separating goats from sheep in a sense.

706
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Exactly.

707
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Here's the story.

708
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:53,000
However you interpret this will determine if you're one of these types.

709
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
That's exactly it.

710
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
And in fact...

711
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:00,000
It's genius. It really is.

712
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:09,000
In fact, he comes close to saying this, you know, in the seventh letter that you can't get philosophy from some treatise.

713
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:20,000
That it's not like, you know, philosophy is not about subscribing to a worldview that some guy has written down in a treatise.

714
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:29,000
You have to have direct experiential knowledge of certain things about the nature of reality.

715
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:37,000
And you're only going to get that in dialogue and in a life in common, he says, with others also devoted to seeking the truth.

716
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:42,000
So Plato has this unwritten doctrine.

717
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:52,000
And this unwritten doctrine deploys all kinds of noble lies up to and including, I believe, the theory of forms.

718
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:57,000
And to my mind, Plato doesn't subscribe to the objective existence of these forms.

719
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:09,000
They're useful constructs to promote the rise of rational thought of the kind that eventually becomes scientific analysis.

720
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Wow.

721
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Really, Plato, really, Plato sees the world more like Heraclitus saw it.

722
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,000
That is amazing.

723
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:31,000
I have no... I don't even know what... I think I want to leave it right there because that's perfect.

724
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:34,000
That leaves the viewer with something to think about.

725
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:46,000
And because I think when we stick to the way we started off with talking about the Mithraist and how their religion sort of is this religion that influences all areas of the world and all religious aspects.

726
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
And obviously, Zoroaster comes along.

727
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:54,000
He transforms this movement and he shapes philosophy of the West.

728
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,000
And then we had this divide happening.

729
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
There's people looking at gods in different ways.

730
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
And which side do we devote ourselves to?

731
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Plato comes along and answers that question in an inverse way.

732
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Very secretive, very esoteric, but he does it.

733
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
That's it.

734
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Absolutely.

735
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,000
And I think the takeaway is what you said as you put it.

736
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:28,000
His intention was to separate the goats from the sheep to find a way to basically pass society through that filter

737
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:32,000
and to test people's metal.

738
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
That's where the fricking question comes from, right?

739
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
It's the myth of the metals.

740
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:44,000
And our expression to test someone's metal comes from the myth of the metals, ultimately, to see what someone's made of.

741
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
What are you made of?

742
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Right?

743
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:56,000
By the way, just as a nice concluding note, that's very much the question in Christopher Nolan's film, The Dark Knight,

744
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
which I think is the greatest of the Batman films.

745
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Yes, it is.

746
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
What are you made of?

747
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
That's what that film turns around.

748
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:09,000
But that film also turns around the noble lie, the whole films about the noble lie.

749
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Yeah.

750
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:16,000
But Batman as the guardian of Gotham, the philosopher king, the guardian of Gotham,

751
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:25,000
is forced to lie to the entire populace to take the blame for the murders committed by Harvey Dent,

752
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:33,000
so that Harvey Dent or Two-Face can retain his image as the white knight of Gotham.

753
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Because if people were to know that this district attorney, champion of justice and hero fighting against corruption,

754
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:48,000
that he was driven by the Joker into becoming Two-Face and committing all these murders,

755
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:52,000
if people were to see Harvey Dent in that light, they would lose faith.

756
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,000
And, you know, it would unleash anarchy and chaos in the city.

757
01:54:55,000 --> 01:55:05,000
And so the Joker, the trickster, forces Batman to become a noble liar in the guise of being the guardian of Gotham.

758
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
But yeah, what does that film turn around?

759
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:14,000
The idea of testing someone's metal, of asking, hammering someone the way Batman is hammered by the Joker,

760
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:17,000
and of asking them the question, what are you made of?

761
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Show your face.

762
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
The one under the mask.

763
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Plato wore masks throughout his entire philosophical career.

764
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:32,000
All of these characters in these dialogues are one or another mask of Plato, not just Socrates.

765
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:41,000
But the conversation we've been having is really ultimately about the face underneath those masks that Plato wore.

766
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Wow. That is just phenomenal.

767
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:49,000
And I'm sure we will think of another thing to discuss in a future date.

768
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:57,000
But as of now, I think this completes this four-part series in the, what is behind Western esotericism,

769
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:04,000
and where does it come from, and where, how does it end up on Plato's lap for him to make their choice?

770
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
And it's like an IQ test.

771
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
He's like giving the world an IQ test.

772
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Here you go.

773
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Here's, take it or leave it.

774
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Let's see where you're at.

775
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Let's see how you interpret this.

776
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,000
And a test of character on ethos.

777
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Test of ethos, right?

778
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Because who within ethos would ever worship Zeus or Yahweh?

779
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Yeah.

780
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:26,000
You don't have to be a genius, right?

781
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:31,000
I mean, in Plato's ideal state in the Republic, you have the philosopher,

782
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:36,000
but then the warrior cast, the warrior cast, they're in the positions that they are because they're virtuous.

783
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,000
They're noble.

784
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:40,000
It's why they're entrusted with a weaponry to protect society.

785
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:44,000
They're not geniuses, the people in the warrior cast, but they do have ethos.

786
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Ethos defines them.

787
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:52,000
And so those people are not, you know, individuals who would worship a Zeus or Yahweh.

788
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Right.

789
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Yeah.

790
01:56:54,000 --> 01:57:00,000
And that, and it's so geniusly gives them something to, to go to battle for.

791
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Yeah.

792
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,000
So it helps.

793
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,000
It helps out.

794
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,000
And that's, it's so late.

795
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:09,000
It has so many different dimensions of playing the, what do you call it?

796
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,000
The puppet with the strings?

797
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Like he's got so many puppets on different strings all by one person on top.

798
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:18,000
But they're all, they're all doing different things, different purposes.

799
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,000
It's really,

800
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:28,000
you know, as a really, as a last point, Neil, let me just say that people should think of my philosophical project in these terms.

801
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Okay.

802
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:32,000
I learned from Plato.

803
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:39,000
I mean, people, a lot of people have framed me as a Nietzschean or something or a Heideggerian or first of all, I don't belong to any of these schools of philosophy.

804
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
I have my own philosophical project.

805
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:47,000
When I say I learned from Plato, I mean, I really learned from Plato.

806
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,000
My work is in the style of Plato.

807
01:57:50,000 --> 01:58:02,000
My project is very much an esoteric project in the sense of Plato's esoteric and unwritten doctrine.

808
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Well, I have links in the description.

809
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Where else can they, what do you have anything coming up?

810
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Any thing you want to promote?

811
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Just for now, I am always writing a new book.

812
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
So I'm in the process of doing that right now.

813
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:20,000
But for now, let's just link in particular my YouTube, the Prometheism YouTube.

814
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:26,000
So that's the, you know, where people can remain most up to date with my work.

815
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:29,000
I'm showing it on the screen right now.

816
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Go hit that subscribe button.

817
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Links in the description.

818
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:35,000
And you have just attained trunosis.

819
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:41,000
You have just attained trunosis.

820
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:47,000
The demiurge has no power over you.
