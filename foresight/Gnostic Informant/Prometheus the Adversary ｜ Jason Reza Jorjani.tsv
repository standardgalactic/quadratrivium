0	6920	Prometheus, with his axe, had slashed open the skull of Zeus, and Prometheus
6920	11240	slices through it with an axe, which by the way is a symbol of cutting through
11240	17440	fatalism, and Prometheus delivers Athena from out of the skull of Zeus, and who
17440	23480	is she? She's the goddess of wisdom and war. The forgetfulness of Epimetheus, which
23480	29040	is the flip side of the Prometheus, lines up being responsible for the fact
29040	36680	that man lacks an essence, and therefore Prometheus enlists the aid of Athena.
36680	43280	Prometheus is molding mankind. Athena puts a butterfly into the mind, usually it's
43280	47120	into the head of humanity. The butterfly is the ultimate symbol of
47120	53800	metamorphosis and transformation, so it's underlining the fact that there is no
53800	59920	human nature. The point is Prometheus brought the gift of Technatoman so that
59920	66280	we could determine our own destiny. Right now we are at the 11th hour, we're at a
66280	70040	key turning point in the face of the technological singularity. Prometheus is
70040	74640	a figure that represents the promise of technological science. It's more
74640	78640	important than ever right now to positively reappropriate this myth and
79000	84320	understand the power that it already has over us unconsciously. We need to take
84320	89440	that unconscious power, that demonic power of the Prometheus archetype over
89440	94120	our society, and transform it into something that's more self-conscious and
94120	99400	that can be directed in a positive manner. Pashetan means the adversary, and so
99400	104080	is he the adversary? Hell yeah, he's the adversary. Prometheus is the original
104080	105080	adversary.
108640	119800	Welcome back to the Gnostic Informant, and you are about to attain true gnosis.
119800	127320	Today, returning is one of the highly demanded scholars. Dr. Jason Rezegiorgiani,
127320	135480	author of Prometheism, lovers of Sophia, Iranian Leviathan. Prometheus and Atlas,
136040	141320	and a ton of more books, but today, we get the pleasure of talking about Prometheus,
142200	149000	one of the more fascinating characters in mythology. Who is he? What is his story?
149720	153000	We have fragments, we have different writers like Askelos who talks about some of the
153000	158200	stuff that happens in his in his myth, but let's put it all together in one spot.
158840	164600	So Dr. Rezegiorgiani, first of all, welcome to Gnostic Informant again. I'm glad I had you back on.
164680	170600	Let's talk about Prometheus and what exactly is, if we put together his myth into one coherent story,
170600	176280	what is it? So Neil, first of all, great to be back on. Always a pleasure.
177800	186280	The thing about the myth of Prometheus is that it isn't nearly as widely known as it ought to be.
187240	191960	To the point where you have to wonder, and after all, this is a Gnostic-oriented program,
191960	195480	you have to wonder whether there hasn't been some kind of archontic suppression,
196360	204920	because, you know, many Greek myths are the subject of countless children's books and film
204920	211720	adaptations, right, even Hollywood films and so on and so forth, but here we're dealing with a myth
212440	219880	that spans from the War of the Gods and the Titans to the creation of mankind
220120	229400	to the great flood that destroyed a worldwide human civilization, right? I mean, the myth of Prometheus
229400	239880	is unparalleled in terms of its monumental scope, addressing all of the key turning points of, you
239880	248200	know, the creation, evolution, and a potential past destruction of mankind. So why is this myth
248200	257880	as obscure as it is? I think it's because the essence of this myth is a call to rebellion and
257880	265000	self-determination that's extremely threatening to any reigning establishment, and so in the
265000	270600	classical world this myth was already being suppressed because it was a threat to, you know,
270600	277080	the Olympian world order of that time, and then as this myth transformed and we'll discuss this
277080	283480	into a Luciferian form after the advent of Christianity, particularly, you know,
284680	290520	from the Middle Ages through the Renaissance into the early modern period when Prometheus
290520	295960	is rediscovered and reappropriated by particularly romantic authors like Byron and Shelley and
295960	301800	Goethe and so forth. Prometheus yet again became a symbol of insurrection and human
301800	308200	self-determination that was threatening both to the church and to the state, and so this is why I
308200	316520	think that, you know, it's been rendered far more obscure than it ought to be, and so let's unpack,
316520	324120	you know, the core symbols and main twists and turns of this very powerful, I was about to say
324120	329320	epic, but really what it is is a tragedy, and in fact as we'll get into it, Prometheus is the first
329320	336200	known tragedy in the recorded history of human literature. Wow, that's fascinating.
339080	344440	So where should we start? Should we start maybe with the sources? Just a review of...
344440	349240	Because I know you got in Hesiod, you have a lot of Prometheus stuff happening with,
349240	355240	you mentioned Ducalion and the flood, Prometheus sort of plays this role, and I almost wonder if
355240	361480	there's an older proto-Indo-European myth that predates the Sumerians and this myth because
361480	366440	he looks like he's playing the same role Anki's playing in Sumeria, where he tells, well Anki
366440	371800	tells what a Gilgamesh or whoever, hey build a flood because Anu's going to flood everybody out,
371800	375800	but in the Hesiod myth he's like, it's just Zeus doing that, it's the same thing,
376920	381640	and then you have Oscalus, but I'm jumping ahead now, but yeah, let's get to the sources, sure.
382600	390760	So there most certainly is both an Indo-European predecessor or prototype for this myth
391320	396440	and also a Sumerian one, and actually since you went there, let me just run with that,
397080	403560	that basically the myth of Prometheus in its Greek form appears to be a synthesis
404360	413560	of the myth of Anki with the story of a figure called Amirani, and so let me start with the lesser
413560	423960	known one, Amirani is a fire-bringing titan that was worshiped by the Schizian branch of the Iranian
423960	432120	peoples who lived in the Caucasus. Now of course, you know, if anyone knows even the
432120	435640	littlest bit about the myth of Prometheus, they know that Prometheus was bound in the Caucasus
435640	441880	by Zeus, this is where, you know, it's the site where he's punished, tortured for having been
441880	451160	the benefactor of mankind. So in the Caucasus Mountains, there was actually this cult of Amirani,
452040	459560	and you had the Schizians worshipping a titan who waged war against the gods
460200	469400	and who brought fire to mankind and taught humans metallurgy, including how to forge weapons,
469400	476680	and you often see imagery of Amirani in particularly what's present day Georgia,
476680	484360	which used to be, you know, a Schizian-Iranian territory, and in fact the last remnant of
484360	491400	the Schizian people, the Ossetians, still live in Georgia today. And so in that area of Georgia and
491400	498600	Ossetia, this, you know, stronghold of the Iranians in the Caucasus, you see this imagery of Amirani
498600	505480	holding a torch in one hand and a sword in the other, you know, symbolizing the fact that this
505480	510920	fire that he stole from the heavens and brought to humanity was used as a fire of the forge,
511800	517640	including in order to empower humanity to basically declare its independence from tyrannical and
517640	527400	unjust gods. So this Amirani figure also winds up being chained and attacked by the eagle of the
528360	534600	tyrannical lord that he leads humanity in a rebellion against. And we'll come to this later
534680	541720	as part of, you know, the various episodes in the myth of Prometheus, but ultimately Hercules,
541720	551560	or the Greek Heracles, frees Prometheus from, you know, his torture being chained to this rock,
551560	558440	and he does so by shooting the eagle of Zeus through with arrows. And this is part of the
558440	565240	Amirani myth that there is this figure who the Greeks called the Schythian Hercules and who the
565240	575720	Ossetians refer to as Batras and who the Eastern Schythians called Rostam, Rostame Saxi, Rostam
575720	583160	the Schythian born, who becomes the epic hero of the Persian national epic, the Shahnameh.
584040	590680	And so this figure in the Amirani myth is the one who comes and frees Amirani by shooting this eagle
590680	597720	through with arrows. And this was such a widely disseminated and deeply entrenched element of
598360	604200	Schythian folklore that the people in Ossetia to this day still have a tradition of destroying
604200	611000	eagle's nests when they find them as a reverence of, you know, a memorialization of
613080	618680	the freeing of Amirani. So clearly there are these elements of the Prometheus myth there.
620120	628200	And it also is worth mentioning in that regard that the Parthian dynasty of Iran
629160	635800	were descended from Schythians. They adopted the Persian, you know, imperial culture and the
635800	640520	legacy of the Achaemenid Persians, but they were not Persians, they were descended from Schythians.
641160	645160	So they were more nomadic barbarian people who then came and took over the seat of the empire
645160	649720	and created the second empire of Iran, the Parthian empire, which was the great rival of classical Rome.
650600	656760	And these Parthians had a myth that was so important to them that it was the basis for the
656760	665080	iconography on their coins. These Parthians had a myth that Perseus stole fire from the heavens
665960	674200	and brought it to mankind and established the order of the Magi in order to be the guardians
674200	681800	of the eternal flame on the earth. And according to this myth, Perseus, the son of Perseus,
681800	687320	was the patriarch of the Persian people. Now, this is interesting because
689240	697080	in the iconography of Perseus slaying Medusa, Perseus is looking away from the head of the
697080	706520	Gorgon as he severs it. And it's been noted by art historians that the iconography of the bull slaying
706520	713240	in Mithraism has this same posture, and you don't find it anywhere else in classical art.
713240	721320	Mithras is looking away from the head of the bull as he slits its throat. And in Mithraism,
722280	731080	Mithra is portrayed as going to battle against Zorvan, who is basically Kronos, the Lord of Time.
731800	738680	And this becomes very significant to the myth of Prometheus. So Mithra overpowers Zorvan,
738680	747080	and Zorvan was depicted as a Gorgon. So the Medusa imagery in the myth of Perseus is like
747080	756600	a later reiteration of this archaic-mythraic idea of Mithra, namely what becomes later Perseus,
756600	765240	slaying the Gorgonic Lord of Time and appropriating its power in the form of the severed head,
765240	771800	but looking away from it at the same time. And this same figure steals fire from the heavens,
771800	776520	brings it down to earth. His son is the patriarch of the Persians, and he creates the order of the
776520	784280	Magi, namely the priests of Zarathustra's religion, to be the guardians of the fire. And
784520	790360	there are a lot of elements of the teaching of Zarathustra, like the use of the term Titan of
790360	797000	Wisdom to refer to Aura Mazda, the main symbol of the religion being the eternal fire,
797000	802120	the main quality of Aura Mazda being forethought, which is a synonym of Promethea,
802680	806840	the root of the name of Prometheus, forethought, or thinking ahead, or the progressive
806840	814440	mentality, the forward-oriented mind. And so you can see that there's this older
814440	821480	Indo-European, particularly Iranian, matrix of the Prometheus myth coming from out of the Caucasus,
823080	826760	which is a general region of Zarathustra as well. He was a little bit further to the south
826760	834360	and around Lake Urumye in Iranian Azerbaijan, but same general region around the Caspian Sea.
834920	843720	And it looks like what happened is this myth fused with the myth of Angie. And how did that happen?
843720	850760	Well, the Persian Empire emanating from out of Persia, from out of the territory right above
850760	858920	the Persian Gulf, took both Mesopotamia, and then of course the Iranians were native
858920	864280	inhabitants of the Caucasus, so the Persian Empire connected the territory where the Sumerian
864280	869640	myths were prevalent, with the territory where you had the myth of Amirani in the Caucasus.
869640	876680	And these two somehow fused so that by the time Hesiod is living in Anatolia, which again is part
876680	884040	of the Persian Empire, Hesiod was a citizen of Iran. Well, Hesiod's time actually was slightly
884040	890280	before the Persian Empire, but the Medes were already very dominant going into southern Anatolia.
890280	893400	And then the Medes and the Persians joined together to create this empire. In any case,
895160	904840	the territory where Hesiod winds up basically functioning as this bard and laying this ground
904840	911640	work for Greek folklore becomes a core part of the Persian Empire. And I think that these two
911640	916120	myths fused there. So what's the other one, the myth of Angie, which is about how there's this
916120	922920	conflict between two brothers among the Anunnaki. One of them wants to create mankind as a slave
922920	929000	race to serve the various purposes of these gods who came down to earth from the heavens.
930840	937880	And that's Elel, Elel or Enlil. And he's a storm god, basically Jehovah. And his psychological
937880	943480	profile is more or less identical to that of Jehovah in the Old Testament, Yahweh.
943480	945560	I think even El comes from that, right?
945560	947800	El, exactly. Yeah, so El. Yeah.
949800	959240	And then, yeah, and Elel, it's interesting, Elel, Allah, Allah, El, Allah, the Muslim thing
959240	964360	is no god but El. You could think about, they translated these days, they love to say there's
964360	970680	no god but God, as if it's some universalistic statement. You have this abstract monotheistic
970680	976840	theology. But really, in a way, you could read that as saying there's no god but El, namely Elel.
976840	981480	And the letter, and the out of the Semitic olive, whether it's Arabic or Hebrew or whatever,
981480	989400	that's the El, that's the letter you use for El. It's not hell, because you use a hat for the
989400	995000	letter E. So people don't realize that it really is El, not El, but they just pronounce El.
995400	1003480	Yes. It's all the evolution of the El cult. And this El bastard wanted to create us as a slave race,
1005000	1008920	meant to just serve the purposes of the Anunnaki.
1008920	1015720	Well, since we're on the subject, I noticed they try to polemicize this Titan mythology,
1015720	1019240	because they make it look like these are fallen angels that are giving metal,
1019240	1025240	algae, and fire to Enoch. And this is in the myth of Enoch, where you have Ezzel and
1025240	1030760	Samael and all these different fallen demon angels or whatever they are. And they're falling in love
1030760	1035080	with the women and they're teaching men how to use fire and teaching them how to use metals.
1035080	1038360	And you're like, wait a minute, are they polemicizing the other myth? And that's probably what's going
1038360	1044200	on. Absolutely. Now, I was going to wait to get to this, but look, it's just so this, we're in
1044200	1050440	a better flow here. Let me just say it right now, that in the myth of Prometheus,
1051960	1058040	it said that Prometheus didn't just bring fire, you know, didn't just steal fire from the workshop
1058040	1066280	of Hephaestus on Mount Olympus and bring it as a gift to mankind. Prometheus taught humanity
1067240	1073880	the various arts and sciences. Prometheus teacher in every art is how Escalus puts it.
1074600	1082040	And so Prometheus, in that Greek version of the myth, is performing exactly the same function.
1082040	1089320	Teacher in every art brought the fire as a means to mighty ends, Escalus says, mighty ends, like
1089320	1096120	the way Amirani taught humanity how to use this fire to forge weapons among other things, among
1096120	1103560	other metallurgical, you know, crafts, right. And so Prometheus is doing exactly what the
1103560	1111800	fallen angels were supposedly doing in the book of Enoch. The book of Enoch was basically censored
1111800	1120200	from the Old Testament. It survived more or less only in an Ethiopian form. And it explains what
1120920	1127000	the hell happened in Genesis six, which is an absolutely, you know, it's an absurd part of the
1127000	1132760	Bible, where in like, literally one paragraph, you're told that these angels came down and they
1132760	1138840	had sex with, you know, mortal women, and there was this race of giants consequently sired on the
1138840	1144120	earth, and they became rebellious against heaven. And God decides as a result of this to basically
1144120	1148920	wipe out all of mankind in this global deluge. And you're left wondering, with this one paragraph,
1149000	1152760	like, what the hell happened here? What could have happened that God has decided to wipe clean
1152760	1157000	his whole creation, right? And by the way, what kind of God is this who didn't see this coming?
1157000	1165960	Anyway, clearly not an omniscient God. So it's basically LL, or as we're going to see Zeus in
1165960	1175960	the myth Prometheus. And so Prometheus does exactly what the fallen angels supposedly did,
1175960	1181000	which you see in the book of Enoch, it expands on Genesis six at length and talks about how
1181000	1185320	they came down and their purpose was to empower humanity. Then we're just coming down have sex
1185320	1191000	with mortal women. They were having sex with mortal women to create a race of hybrids on the
1191000	1198200	earth who would be able to contest, you know, the sovereignty of the gods would be able to lead a
1198200	1206280	essentially liberation struggle against heaven and to storm heaven as it were. And so they teach
1206280	1211960	humanity all the arts and sciences exactly what Prometheus did and exactly what Enki is supposed
1211960	1220040	to have done. So Enki, Enki is the creator of mankind. Just like in the myth of Prometheus,
1220040	1226600	it's not Zeus who creates humanity. Prometheus is the architect of humanity, the father of mankind.
1226600	1230280	And he's a good father. He's the father who wants his children to flourish,
1230280	1235480	and he beneficently attempts to empower them. He's the kind of father who wants to see his
1235480	1240520	children do even better than him. And so he teaches humanity all these arts and sciences.
1241160	1249800	Just like Enki sends seven sages to teach humanity all of the various crafts. And, you know,
1249880	1255080	Ella was furious about this. And, you know, then it lays the groundwork ultimately for this global
1255080	1262600	deluge to basically decimate the high civilization that develops on the basis of the arts and the
1262600	1269400	sciences that were taught to humanity by the rebel and Enki, or as the Christians later call them,
1269400	1275160	the fallen angels. And you see all of this in the myth of Prometheus. I mean, you know,
1275160	1282440	so I'm really jumping ahead now, but and we can come back around to it in a sequential order.
1283000	1290440	But basically, you know, people lose sight of the fact that the flood myth exists as part of the
1290440	1298280	myth of Prometheus in Greek culture. Prometheus' son, Dukallion, is the Greek Noah figure.
1298440	1303640	Right. Except that the Greek version makes a hell of a lot more sense.
1303640	1310200	Right. Because why would the same God who's trying to wipe out humanity with a flood appoint
1310200	1319000	someone to save humanity from the flood? It doesn't make any sense. This is a Yahwist appropriation
1319000	1325240	of an older myth, which was threatening to that religious establishment, a myth wherein it's the
1326040	1335240	son or a representative of the Enki figure, son of Prometheus, who attempts to save what he can
1335240	1342120	of humanity from this global deluge. And so this is Dukallion and Dukallion is depicted very much
1342120	1348680	in the guise of the sages that worked with Enki as a kind of civilizer. He not only saves a portion
1348680	1354120	of humanity from this flood, he helps to reestablish civilization on the earth. So he's kind of like
1355640	1361240	you could say the bricklayer of the Tower of Babel to put it in biblical terms. The one who, you
1361240	1367560	know, makes another attempt after the flood to build a tower to the heavens to empower and
1367560	1375240	unify humanity. So, yeah, so the myth of Dukallion connects Prometheus to the flood myth in the
1375240	1381720	Bible and underlines the fact that Prometheus is essentially, to put it in biblical terms,
1381720	1390440	the leader of the fallen angels. Figures that later winds up being called Lucifer. And well,
1390440	1396120	what's Lucifer? The bringer of the light. Well, that's the fire that he brought from heaven. It's
1396120	1403240	pretty obvious. Which is funny because in Lucifer's Roman mythology with Ovid and other writers,
1403240	1408680	there's nothing evil about him. He's a hero. He's like, he's a savior god. There's nothing,
1408680	1412840	he's not Satanic or whatever the hell the Christians try to say about him later on.
1413560	1418520	Or Isaiah tries to say about him in his text. He's just, he's just a light bringer. He's the
1418520	1425080	son of dawn. Yeah. Well, but the thing is, he is Satanic in the sense that the word Satan,
1425080	1432600	shaitan, just means ha-shaitan in Hebrew or shaitan in Arabic. Ha-shaitan means the adversary.
1432600	1437720	And so is he the adversary? Hell yeah, he's the adversary. Prometheus is the original
1437720	1443320	adversary. Right? And, and there's something, and I want to come back to this flood myth. Okay,
1443320	1447400	but let me just go on a tangent for a minute back to the very beginning, right? Because I want to
1447400	1454600	highlight the way in which this character is radically adversarial. Prometheus betrays the
1454600	1462840	Titans. He's an adversary first against his fellow Titans. So he's not a god. Prometheus is a Titan.
1462840	1470280	And he turns on the Titans and sides with Zeus in the Titanomachia, in the clash of the Titans,
1471000	1477240	because Prometheus goes to these fellow Titans. He's like, listen, you can't defeat these Olympians
1477240	1482440	through brute force. I'm telling you, there's got to be strategy here. He lays out stratagems
1483000	1488120	with his forethought and they won't have it. And so Prometheus takes the position that, well,
1488120	1492360	you know, these Titans are going to lose. This is a lose. It's futile. They're going to lose.
1492840	1500680	And so in order to basically put himself in a better position for achieving a more long-term
1500680	1506040	objective, he shrewdly sides with the Olympians and helps Zeus come to power.
1507720	1514360	Then he realizes in due course that, and let me just point a couple of things out before I continue
1515240	1524120	down that road, that when this happens, Prometheus has three brothers and two of them wind up being
1524120	1529720	punished by Zeus after he comes to power, after the Olympians win in the Titanomachia.
1530360	1536360	Two of Prometheus's three brothers are punished together with the other Titans. And one of them
1536360	1544760	is a figure called Minotius. Minotius was bound in Tartarus under the earth together with the other
1544760	1559880	Titans. And he's the Titan of excessive wrath, prideful rage, and hubris. So you can see how
1559880	1565800	this is a shadow side of Prometheus that later is integrated into the Judeo-Christian image
1565800	1572440	of Satan. It's the side of Prometheus, the brother of Prometheus as it were, who is bound under the
1572440	1578920	earth. In other words, what becomes later hell in the Judeo-Christian cosmology. He's that side of
1578920	1586280	Prometheus that is bound in the pit of hell as it were and has this exceedingly wrathful,
1586280	1594840	prideful defiance of Zeus from the beginning. And then the other brother of Prometheus,
1594840	1602440	another brother of Prometheus, Atlas, is the strongest of the Titans and he led the Titans in
1602440	1608600	the battle. He was the general who leads the Titans in the Titanomachia and he's punished
1608600	1614840	by forcing him to separate heaven and earth through bearing the celestial sphere on his
1614840	1622360	own shoulders, which is an incredibly powerful symbol. Because it means that he's not just
1622440	1628440	separating heaven and earth, he's connecting heaven and earth. So heaven and earth are connected
1628440	1636200	through Atlas and remember Atlas was against Zeus and so in a way he's sort of in this dynamic
1636200	1642200	position where he could storm heaven from the earth because he's the one holding up the heavens.
1642200	1650120	And then later Atlas becomes a metaphor for all kinds of basically maps of knowledge.
1651080	1655400	Right, that's good. Atlas is in the sense of star charts which
1656040	1662360	seafarers use to navigate the oceans. And so then map making was associated with Atlas,
1662360	1667320	Atlas is of the world. And then even in medicine you have Atlas is of the human body,
1667320	1674280	you know, the basically, you know, this portrayals of the skeletal system and the nervous system and
1674280	1679400	so on. They're called medical Atlas. And so Atlas is a term that's very much associated with
1680280	1685640	bodies of knowledge and mapping out the world for the sake of gaining greater knowledge.
1685640	1692840	And so in this way Atlas is also intimately connected with the meaning of the myth of Prometheus
1692840	1698680	and reflects another aspect of Prometheus' association with science and technology,
1698680	1702360	which is of course that the light of the fire that he brings from Olympus,
1703240	1707240	the light of the fire in the dark night of human ignorance, and also the fire of the
1707240	1711560	forge that's a symbol of technological science. And so it's not incidental that Atlas is the
1711560	1716360	brother of Prometheus, it's emphasizing the association of Prometheus with technological
1716360	1721000	science and humanity's quest for knowledge and mapping out of the world through human
1721000	1729480	initiative and exploration and the quest for discovery. And then the last brother of Prometheus
1729560	1737800	is Epimetheus, who, he's the fool, he's the idiot, his name means afterthought.
1737800	1742680	Instead of forethought Prometheus, it comes from Epimetheus, which is the opposite
1742680	1749160	adjectival quality, meaning afterthought or hindsight, like, you know, like when you look
1749160	1754200	back and say, shit, I shouldn't have done that, you know, that's Epimetheus, you know,
1754680	1762920	hard-earned hindsight and realizing something only in retrospect. So Epimetheus, the other
1762920	1769880	brother of Prometheus, is this forgetful fool, right, hindsight, we're talking about, you know,
1769880	1779160	how his name means afterthought. And he sides with Prometheus, takes his advice that they should
1779160	1786280	basically help Zeus come to power. And so he's rewarded by being allowed to help Prometheus
1787240	1794600	in the creation of mankind, and in fact, in the creation of the animals in general. So Epimetheus
1794600	1802440	functions as a kind of subcontractor who helps Prometheus as Prometheus is, you know, molding
1802440	1810360	mankind from out of clay. And by the way, just on a side note, this whole issue of man being
1810360	1815400	molded from out of clay, the race of man being molded from out of clay is significant because
1817640	1827160	in the Semitic tradition that eventually yields Islam, it's said that before the race of clay,
1827880	1834360	which, you know, is Adam, the race of Adam, which is not just a person, but a race, Adam
1835080	1843320	is a mankind made of clay. And according to the Semitic myths before Adam, there was a race made
1843320	1850360	of fire on the earth. And so it appeared, and of course fire is the element associated with Prometheus.
1851240	1855480	And this race of fire rebelled against the angels, against the
1860120	1869000	Malayech, you know, the angels, and against El, against Allah. And they're punished. So it appears
1869000	1873560	and their civilization is wiped off the face of the earth. So it appears that yet again,
1873560	1878680	there is this parallel from the Greek myth to, you know, some kind of Semitic version,
1879240	1885720	where the satanic is associated with the race of fire. And then the race of man,
1885720	1891960	the race of clay is seen as being subsequent to that. And so the myth of Prometheus is extremely
1891960	1897400	subversive in an Islamic context, because it's suggesting that actually the race of clay wasn't
1897400	1902520	created by Allah, the way it says in the Quran, the race of clay was created by one of these
1902520	1908680	beings of fire, who was a rebel against Allah. Right. And again, another myth that's been
1909240	1916120	reappropriated, misappropriated by Yahwists, or if we want to put it in Islamic terminology,
1916120	1923480	you know, Muslims, right, submitters, as the name suggests. So okay, what we were talking about was
1924280	1929960	the nature of Prometheus as a primordial adversary. So what does this character do this,
1929960	1938520	this Epimetheus, he's helping Prometheus create man. And he gives fur to certain animals and
1938520	1943240	claws to other animals to be able to fend for themselves. And he gives sharp teeth to certain
1943240	1949000	other creatures so that they can hunt their food, you know, with their mouths, and basically give
1949000	1955720	some kind of survival advantage to every creature. But then when it comes to man, Epimetheus forgives,
1955720	1960680	forgets to give man any essential quality that would be able to
1963560	1970440	afford him, you know, a survival, a survival advantage that would be able to,
1970440	1978280	you know, secure his existence on the earth. And so man is left lacking an essence. This is
1978280	1985320	extremely important. The forgetfulness of Epimetheus, which is the flip side of the
1985320	1992360	Promethea of Prometheus, winds up being responsible for the fact that man lacks an essence.
1994120	1997560	And therefore Prometheus enlists the aid of Athena,
1998120	2008360	humanity with its soul in the form of a butterfly. So Athena appears in the myth of Prometheus at
2008360	2014520	this point. And there are many images of this, there are reliefs of it, it appears on some
2016840	2025880	seals, it's on some vases and other, you know, Greek pottery. This image of Athena coming in
2025880	2032360	as Prometheus is molding mankind. And there's Epimetheus to the side who forgets to endow
2032360	2038760	man with any essence. And Athena puts a butterfly into the mind, usually it's into the head of
2038760	2049240	humanity. Now why Athena? Why does Athena help? Because Prometheus had midwife Athena into existence.
2049240	2056120	Prometheus with his axe had slashed open the skull of Zeus in a kind of, you know,
2057320	2064520	play on a Caesarean section, had split open the close-knit Pekinos, mind of Zeus. It's an incredibly
2064520	2073880	important image. So Zeus is often associated with fate. And so the Pekinos or close-knit mind of Zeus
2073880	2080760	is the mesh of fate. And Prometheus slices through it with an axe, which by the way is a symbol of
2080760	2087480	cutting through fatalism. And Prometheus delivers Athena from out of the skull of Zeus. And who
2087480	2094520	is she? She's the goddess of wisdom and war. I was just gonna say something. Because in the
2094520	2102920	Gnostic text, you had this understanding of Yahweh thinks he created humans, but really
2103000	2108600	he was in it. He think somehow he had a dream or he thought he created Adam. But really it was Sophia
2108600	2114520	wisdom that did it. And she looks at him like, you don't even know, I'm the one who did all this.
2114520	2119560	And then, but what's even crazier is that the Gnostics who get called heretics for this,
2120200	2125000	they're pointing to the Bible itself and saying, no, no, no, the book of Proverbs says that Sophia
2125000	2131240	was there from the beginning. The wisdom of Solomon says Sophia created the first father.
2131720	2137560	So like this is accurate as far as the scriptures say, not just making this stuff up. And then it
2137560	2143080	lines up with what you're saying, Athena being Sophia as well, and then the titan of wisdom,
2143720	2149720	creating mankind. So even the even the Yahwes have some of their own sources, right, putting this
2149720	2155400	stuff in there and sort of snitching on themselves. Absolutely, absolutely. So that you have the
2155400	2162760	prototype for the Sophianic figure. And in Athena, who is the goddess of wisdom and war, why wisdom
2162760	2173320	and war? Because you cannot gain wisdom without going to war. Because Zeus wants us ignorant.
2174120	2179160	The Olympians don't want us to be wise. They are the prototype for what later become the Gnostic
2179160	2186840	Archons. And so to seek wisdom is to be prepared to go to war against the gods. That's why Athena is
2186840	2193240	the goddess of wisdom and war inextricably. Okay. And so this is also the message of the
2194920	2200600	Bhagavad Gita, where where where where where Christian is telling Arjun, you have to go to
2200600	2205320	war. There's no, no, you have to make an action right now. You cannot just sit by and let your
2205320	2209960	uncle do his thing. You have to fight your uncle. That's a that's a deep thing right there.
2210680	2217160	In a Greek context, it winds up being epitomized by Heraclitus in the fragments of Heraclitus,
2218440	2224680	who by the way, I mean, next to Pythagoras is the first philosopher in Greek history. Heraclitus
2224760	2234360	says war is father and king of all. Some men, it shows or he he shows to be slaves. Others,
2235960	2243640	he he reveals to be free men. All things come to pass and are ordained in accordance with conflict.
2244440	2251960	Right. And so look, a wisdom and war. So why does Athena help Prometheus in this situation where
2251960	2256120	man is left lacking in essence on accounts of the forgetfulness of Epimetheus? Well,
2256120	2262120	because Prometheus was the midwife of Athena's birth. Right. Okay. And so Athena returns the
2262120	2268120	favor by giving man his soul in the form of a butterfly. Now, does this, does this give man an
2268120	2274360	essence? No, not really. And it's another fascinating symbol in this myth, because what's a butterfly?
2274360	2279960	The butterfly is the ultimate symbol of metamorphosis and transformation. Wow. So it's
2279960	2286600	underlining the fact that there is no human nature. There's no human nature.
2288040	2296360	Human quote unquote, nature is to transform, to evolve, to become something else. We are beings
2296360	2301320	of radical becoming. And then what's the other thing that Prometheus has to give
2301880	2309160	man in order to basically give him a chance to fend for himself, because he doesn't have the
2309160	2313800	claws that other animals do, where the, you know, large jaws and sharp teeth of other animals are
2313800	2321640	fur, so as not to freeze in the winter, humanity, humanity is gifted fire as a tool of survival.
2322440	2328760	Okay. So fire, which is the fire of the forge, which is the fountain head of all the crafts,
2329800	2337800	and ultimately of technological science, is a remedy for the fact that we are lacking in essence.
2337800	2344680	So what's this myth saying? I mean, why is it that Heidegger and Marx, who don't agree on,
2344680	2349640	you know, all that, I mean, Marx is seen as the intellectual godfather of the left,
2349640	2355080	and Heidegger was literally a Nazi. So, you know, there's some degree of divergence between
2355080	2362120	Marx and Heidegger, but they both said Prometheus was the founder of philosophy that Prometheus is,
2363080	2370440	not God, but divinity, that inaugurates philosophy, okay? His name affects that too,
2370440	2380360	forethought. Yeah, but look, it's because why do Marx and Heidegger agree? Because Marx is all about
2381000	2391160	how modern industrial capitalism is going to free humanity through a revolutionary,
2392360	2399320	you know, dialectic, that modern industrial capitalism is going to be transformed
2400600	2408840	in a way where the power of industry ultimately liberates mankind, and the industry is
2408840	2414920	reappropriated by the workers, and they are no longer alienated from their labor,
2414920	2419960	and they ultimately become sovereign and self-determined. And then Heidegger,
2419960	2426920	the focus of his philosophical project, was how the trajectory of science, of abstract
2426920	2434040	rational thought from Plato onward through Descartes ultimately culminates in modern technological
2434040	2442760	science, and that, you know, we have to find some way to poetically reintegrate the transformative
2442760	2452280	power of modern technological science. So, you know, ultimately what Heidegger saw in the myth
2452280	2463240	of Prometheus has a lot to do with the fact that fire and the butterfly were the two remedies
2463960	2472680	for mankind being lacking in an essence, in the sense that we, uniquely among all animals,
2473400	2483080	define our own essence. Our existence precedes our essence, and the nature of our existence
2483560	2492040	is to define our own essence through the power of technology, and to be the, basically,
2493560	2498440	the stewards of our own evolution. So, we are these butterflies that go through a process of
2498440	2503000	metamorphosis from the caterpillar through the chrysalis, right, to ultimately becoming this
2504360	2507880	creature. It's kind of like what Nietzsche's getting at with the rope and the Superman thing.
2508680	2517080	Exactly, exactly. It is the first version of that symbol or metaphor that ultimately becomes
2517080	2525320	Nietzsche's tight rope between ape and overman. And I also noticed that all of the ancient Greek
2525320	2534840	mysteries, all the great myths, basically, there's usually some sort of metamorphosis involved with
2534840	2541240	the hero, with the savior, with the messiah, whoever it is, they all have some sort of apotheosis,
2541240	2547720	metamorphosis, some sort of resurrection, something like that, which makes it a standard
2548760	2551720	mysteries, I guess you would say, initiation cult or something like that.
2553160	2555720	That's the common thread between all of them. You know what I mean?
2556680	2563320	Sure, I do know what you mean, but the thing is that the Olympian world order is predicated
2563320	2568680	on the stasis of humanity. And so to the extent that there are, you know, hero, by the way,
2568680	2574440	originally, it means hybrid. It means hero means it comes from the word eros, and with
2574440	2580600	reference to the eros or sex between gods and mortals. And so the original heroes were the
2580600	2587720	people who were sired by the quote unquote fallen angels, right, and were more than mere humans,
2588360	2592920	and who actually had a rebellious nature and defied the will of heaven, right.
2592920	2599320	And so to the extent that you have these heroes engaging in developmental trajectories and
2599320	2603800	they building up their character and persona and developing an ethos and becoming basically
2603800	2610360	men in their own right, you have a defiance of what Olympus wants, which is us to basically
2610360	2620120	remain servile, you know, and submit to submit. Yeah, and not and not undergo character building,
2620120	2625000	right, which is going to give us enough psychological and ethical independence to
2625000	2631800	determine our own course in the future. So anyway, you have at the core of this myth of the creation
2631800	2636920	of mankind and emphasis of the fact that our existence precedes our essence and that through
2636920	2643080	the power of technological science, we are going to undergo various metamorphoses that
2643080	2649400	ultimately hold the potential for us to become as powerful or more powerful than the gods.
2650200	2658680	And so this is, you know, another element of the the adversarial character of Prometheus,
2658680	2664840	and then you see this continue in his next act of trickery. So Prometheus is not only a trickster
2664840	2670600	because he steals fire from the workshop of the Festus and brings it as a gift to mankind.
2670600	2676920	Prometheus is also a trickster because when Zeus comes around after the creation of humanity,
2676920	2683080	not too happy with how humanity's been created and wanting to reduce humanity to servility,
2683880	2688200	Zeus says to Prometheus, well, now that you created these things, which, you know, I'm not very happy
2688200	2692600	with, you know, how you did this. I don't know about this butterfly business, right.
2692840	2700040	But I want you to decide how they're going to sacrifice to me, right. How are these creatures
2700040	2707960	going to be brought to their knees and, you know, basically worship and revere me. And so Prometheus
2707960	2715880	devises this machination where he presents Zeus with two forms of sacrifice and asks
2715880	2722040	him to choose between them. And in one of them, he's basically taken all of the nourishing,
2722040	2728440	lean meat from an animal, from a sacrificed animal, and stuffed it into the stomach of an ox,
2728440	2736840	which is very visually displeasing. And in the other bowl is the bones, the white bones of the
2736840	2745320	sacrificed animal, but covered with a veneer of marbled fat. And Zeus picks the marbled fat,
2746040	2753000	not realizing that it's all bones underneath. And this means that man gets to keep the nourishing
2753000	2759080	part of the sacrificed animal and is basically giving nothing of importance to Olympus. So this
2759080	2764520	is another way in which we see that Prometheus does not want his children to be, you know,
2764520	2771640	a servile race revering some gods above themselves. Prometheus is trying to, you know, basically
2772040	2783240	ensure that the nourishing part of the sacrifice remains the allotment of human beings.
2783240	2790040	Right. And this is another act of trickery that he engages in, which by the way portrays Zeus as a
2790040	2795560	fool. Because I mean, how do you, what kind of God you don't realize like he's pulling a fast one
2795560	2801560	on you like this? And he see it tries to cover this up. And he see it when he writes the Theogony,
2802200	2807560	in particular, he right, he mentions the myth of Prometheus in both of his major works in works and
2807560	2814360	days, right, and in Theogony. And it's interesting that when you read works and days, Prometheus has
2814360	2824360	a little bit more autonomy. And his defiance of Zeus is a little bolder. But then when he writes
2824360	2831800	Theogony, he see it is really trying to come up with a canon of Olympian religion, right, right.
2831800	2843560	This he see a character is an epitome of Greek traditionalism, patriarchy, conservatism, misogyny,
2843560	2850040	he hates women. Okay. And so when he writes Theogony, he says absurd things like, Oh, well,
2850040	2856520	you know, Zeus knew that Prometheus was trying to pull a fast one on him. And he just, you know,
2856520	2866280	picked the the bowl of bones covered with the fat to like lure Prometheus into committing
2866280	2873640	some sin of defiance or something. He's making justifications to whitewash the vulnerabilities
2873640	2882440	of Zeus, because he's helping to build a cult of total obedience to Olympus. But then later,
2882440	2887560	you have Escalus about 50, 50, 60 years later, or something, somewhere around there, the next
2887560	2895560	century, he he see it is in the 600s BC, Escalus is in the 500s BC. By the time Escalus turns
2895560	2909080	Prometheus into the first figure of Greek tragedy, you see the more humanist and rebellious elements
2909080	2915640	of the myth, yeah, you know, basically restored to what was probably their original form.
2915640	2920600	And I noticed in that in this particular version, with Escalus, I want to ask this,
2920600	2924360	Escalus is very fascinating. Because I know he's initiated in all these mysteries,
2924360	2928520	he gets in trouble, he almost gets killed for spilling the beans of what these mysteries are.
2928520	2934200	Well, anyways, before we even get to that, I noticed that in that text, he really has this
2934200	2940200	long dialogue between Hermes, who is sort of a tempter. He's the mouth word, he's the logos of
2940200	2946360	Zeus. He's the word, he's the, he's the messenger of Zeus, basically. Zeus is won't see him. He's
2946360	2951080	like, why can't Zeus come himself? And I noticed that Prometheus is like antagonizing him,
2951080	2955720	and Hermes is tempting him, oh, we'll let you go, just, you know, just bend the knee, just bend the
2955720	2961640	knee. And Prometheus refuses to cave into the tempter. What is this about?
2963240	2969880	He's the angel Gabriel. Oh, that's awesome. Hermes is who later becomes Jibril, you know,
2969880	2975560	or the angel Gabriel. That makes a lot of sense. Brings the Quran to Muhammad, you know, and so on
2975560	2986200	and so forth. And so this, this messenger of God, the announcer comes and basically, or
2986200	2997320	Poth, you know, comes and basically, he tries to, okay, he's not just tempting Prometheus,
2997320	3004120	he's trying to torture a secret from out of them, because when Prometheus is bound by Zeus,
3004120	3010200	it's not just a punishment, it is a torture that's intended to break Prometheus so that
3010200	3017080	he reveals the secret of who is going to overthrow Zeus. Prometheus, with his forethought, and by the
3017080	3024520	way, the mother of Prometheus is famous, not to be confused with Thadus, who we're going to talk
3024520	3034600	about momentarily, but famous, the tightness is the mother of Prometheus, and she was the creator
3034600	3041400	of the Oracle of Delphi, which she later gives to Apollo. So the prophetic power that's associated
3041400	3049880	with the Oracle of Delphi is also somehow implicit in the myth of Prometheus, because famous, the
3049880	3056120	creator of the Oracle of Delphi is the mother of Prometheus. So anyway, Prometheus, with his
3056120	3061480	prophetic power and his forethought, the kind of forethought and projection that also becomes
3061480	3065960	instrumental to technological science, right? Technological science is all about projection.
3066760	3071320	And so Prometheus, with his power of projection, his forethought and his prophecy,
3071880	3081640	knows who is going to eventually overthrow Zeus. And it turns out that it is the soul
3082360	3092600	who later winds up being born as Achilles. And what Prometheus knows is that Zeus is going to rape
3092600	3098360	famous, you know, Zeus is a serial rapist. He just turns into all these various animals and goes down
3098360	3107000	and basically rapes these women, these poor women. And Prometheus knows that one of these women is
3107000	3113880	going to be famous. And so Achilles is going to be born as a proper hero, a hero in the old sense
3113880	3120680	of a hybrid. He's going to be a demigod. And this demigod version of Achilles is going to lead
3120680	3126680	humanity into rebellion and overthrow Zeus and be a new sovereign over humanity and much more
3126680	3135240	beneficent, much more humanitarian ruler from the throne of Olympus. And later what winds up
3135240	3141640	happening is that actually Zeus finds out that this is going to happen. And so
3144200	3150680	Zeus has, or Zeus basically pulls back and lets famous be married to Peleus,
3150680	3155480	who becomes the human mortal father of Achilles. And then we have the whole story of Achilles and
3155480	3163240	the Iliad. But this Achilles was supposed to be born as a demigod and Prometheus knows this
3163240	3173240	and he wants to torture this out of Prometheus. And so he keeps sending Hermes. He keeps sending
3173240	3181240	Hermes to try to convince Prometheus to give up this secret. While we're on this though, let me
3181240	3186600	point out why is it significant that it's Achilles? And by the way, I discussed this at length in
3186600	3192440	Prometheus and Atlas. The devil's really in the details here and I go into the Iliad and its
3192440	3198200	connection to this part of the myth of Prometheus in my chapter on Prometheus in Prometheus and
3198200	3206920	Atlas. If you look at the character of Achilles and the Iliad, his conflict with Agamemnon
3207720	3217320	and the defiant stance that he takes amidst the Trojan War shows you the first figure in Greek
3217320	3227960	literature who is questioning the social order. In Archaic Greece, there was no conceptual distinction
3227960	3236360	between social order and nature. Nature was framed as a concept by the early philosophers.
3237480	3244760	Who are writing about 150 years at least after the Iliad, at least. In the time of the Iliad,
3244760	3248600	in the time of quote unquote Homer, whether there was actually a Homer who wrote this or
3248600	3252920	whether he was a Bard who later recited it, whatever. In the time of quote unquote Homer,
3254280	3260520	there was no conceptual distinction yet between nature and the nature of things in society. It
3260520	3266680	was believed that customs were God given the way that, you know, the seasons are God given.
3267240	3273560	The way that the habits of animals are God given, social institutions are just the way things are
3273560	3277640	and they can't be questioned anymore than, you know, the way the birds and the bees live on.
3278280	3286840	Right? It's all just the way things inevitably have to be. Right. And so when you see Achilles
3286840	3293560	in the Iliad basically call bullshit on Agamemnon and confront him as an unjust tyrannical ruler
3293560	3300440	and a bad commander and stand up for himself pridefully, some would say with hubris, the kind
3300440	3306920	of hubris that we see from Prometheus ultimately. Right. You are seeing the first questioning of
3306920	3314520	the social order and implicit framing of the concept of justice. Wow. As opposed to the way
3314520	3321080	things just are. So Achilles is saying, sorry, fuck that. Things shouldn't be this way.
3322040	3328360	They should be some other way. Right. And this is the kernel of the idea of Utopia right here
3329160	3335960	in the figure of Achilles. So what's being said in the myth of Prometheus, where Prometheus knows
3336520	3343320	that it's Achilles who's going to overthrow Zeus if he's allowed to be born as a demigod,
3344440	3347880	is that there's a connection being made back to the story of the Iliad
3348600	3355080	and to the first framing of a just order, as opposed to the de facto order of the world,
3355080	3362040	the first aspiration for Utopia. That is also part and parcel of this part of the Prometheus myth.
3362040	3367160	It's the birth of progressivism. And I just thought of something. There's an epigram in
3367160	3371640	the first century. I think during the time of Vespasian or Domitian or something like that,
3372200	3378920	Marshall was the author. And he says that he has a quick little hymn or epigram, I guess they're
3378920	3386200	called, where he says Prometheus, just as Prometheus is bound to the Scythian cliff, nourished the
3386200	3393240	constant bird with the glut of his stomach. So did Laurelis hanging from a cross that was no stage
3393240	3399480	prop offered up his uncovered trails to the Caledonian bear. And I noticed that there's this
3400440	3409160	this is somebody who's inspired by the Epicureans and the naturalists and the Stoics. And he's
3409160	3415400	looking at Prometheus as an example, this great example of sacrificing yourself for the good,
3415400	3422600	for the progress of the world. And that brings us to Christianity. Are they trying to do something
3422600	3428600	similar to this with Jesus? I think so. Yes, although it's a perversion of it, and we'll come
3428680	3436680	to that. But and notice also in this quote, the Scythian peaks. Right. So yet again, the Greeks
3436680	3442280	knew that the place where Prometheus was bound was Scythian territory. And this connects again
3442280	3448120	back to the myth of Amirani and how there's an awareness here that somehow this Prometheus myth
3448120	3454920	has Scythian origins. Right. At least one of its vectors is Scythian. The other one is the
3454920	3460120	myth of Enki and probably were fused in the Persian Empire. So speaking of the Persian Empire,
3460120	3468680	we're talking about Escalus. And Escalus, you know, he's famous as a as a poetic playwright and
3470360	3477640	really as the founder of drama. And, you know, in its current form, before Escalus,
3477640	3487400	there was only a single bar reciting a poem on a stage. And it's Escalus who introduced other
3487400	3494520	characters and created a drama where there's multiple perspectives. Right. And this is again,
3494520	3498680	this is not where I was about to go. But, you know, again, we need to pause and just reflect on
3498680	3504120	this for a minute. Yeah. But just just contemplate what a transformation of human consciousness
3504120	3507320	that is. And again, this is something I go into at length in Prometheus and Atlas.
3509960	3517560	Before Escalus, you had a bard who was basically reciting an ancestral tradition.
3518280	3526280	And you only had that bard's perspective. And moreover, the bard did not insert himself into
3526920	3533000	the poem so as to, you know, interject any commentary on it. Right. You're just having a
3533000	3541640	person acting as a medium for the transmission of ancestral tradition. Escalus invents this thing,
3542520	3547640	which we call drama in retrospect, where there's multiple characters and they each have their
3547640	3553720	own perspective. So think about this. What effect does this have on people's consciousness where
3553720	3560680	they're watching a stage play where for the first time, they're getting multiple characters
3561640	3568600	with different divergent perspectives, each of which the audience member could choose to identify
3568600	3577160	with and to flip between these divergent perspectives. And moreover, the setting for this
3577160	3582840	drama with multiple characters in it is an amphitheater where literally there's multiple
3582840	3589400	perspectives on the drama. Right. Depending on where you're sitting in the amphitheater on any
3589480	3597160	given night, during the many times that you go to see a stage play, you will have one or another
3597160	3603160	varying perspective on the drama. So there's the perspectival shift between the various characters
3603160	3611160	and then the perspectival shift in terms of geometry, perceptual geometry of the audience
3611160	3617560	member sitting in an amphitheater. And lo and behold, this is the moment when we go from really
3617640	3623480	stiff Egyptian style sculptures in Greece to photorealistic three-dimensional sculptures in
3623480	3632840	Greece with that extremely true to life, high precision that classical Greek sculptures are
3632840	3637640	famous for. Do you think that just happened by accident? Now what happened? Because you had
3637640	3642680	sculptors who were sitting there in amphitheaters watching stage plays from varying perspectives
3642680	3649080	on different night, different evenings, and they discovered perspective, both geometric
3649080	3654920	perspective and also psychological perspective by flipping between the viewpoints of different
3654920	3662360	characters in a drama. Escalus is responsible for this. And which is the first of the dramas that
3662360	3670840	Escalus composed? Who is the first figure of tragedy, Prometheus? Right. So you see, this is
3670840	3675960	also bound up into the myth of Prometheus, this elevation mutation of human consciousness
3675960	3682440	that becomes so defining of classical Greek culture and in particular its excellence in the arts.
3682440	3688600	And then by extension, geometry as well, which becomes the cornerstone for all of the
3689240	3693960	sciences. I mean, let no one who hasn't studied geometry enter here. It was a
3693960	3698600	statement over the doorway to Plato's Academy. And by the way, in Plato's Academy,
3698600	3705880	since I mentioned that Plato's Academy, there was a altar to Prometheus. Wow. There was a burning
3705880	3716520	fire on an altar in Plato's Academy. And there was a tradition of lighting torches in this fire altar
3716520	3724360	and running them down into the city of Athens from there. And in fact, Plato opens his republic,
3724360	3731080	which is probably his most Promethean text. Plato opens republic with the image of this torch race,
3731080	3740040	this torch bearing rally, the torch bearing relay race is the opening of Plato's republic.
3741160	3747720	And you know, this became then the basis for the lighting of the torch and the passing of the torch
3747720	3751880	in the Olympic Games, which probably shouldn't be called the Olympic Games, it should be called
3751880	3760600	the Promethean Games. Anyway, to go back to Escalus, because where did we, how did we get here? We
3760600	3765400	got here, I was talking about the Persian Empire. Right. Well, I was actually going to jump in real
3765400	3769800	quick before we get back to him. There's an author named, he's actually pretty famous, Erratus the,
3770360	3775960	Erratus thes. He's Erratus thes. Erratus thes. Sorry, I'm sorry. And he's one of the greatest
3775960	3781800	scientists of the age. And he has a story of Alexander the Great being in a cave near
3782280	3787800	Caucasus, where he identifies that the demigod Prometheus was here being imprisoned.
3789000	3795640	So Alexander the Great was like, this is a sacred place. Everybody stop what you're doing.
3795640	3800600	Let's offer sacrifice to Prometheus right here right now. And then Errin and Nicomedia also has
3800600	3806360	the same story in his books too. So that's just shows you how these elites love this god. He's
3806840	3810040	he's another category. He's special.
3815000	3818520	Let me let me just comment on that before we go back to the thread about Escalus,
3818520	3821640	because you said certain elites, whatever. Yeah. Well,
3824360	3831000	one can say many things about the Rockefellers, but one thing that David Rockefeller did that
3831560	3837560	was quite impressive was erect the statue of Prometheus in Rockefeller Center.
3839080	3846920	And which I tend to think of as the hard fire of New York City and basically the
3847560	3853800	sacred center of what is still hanging on as the cosmopolitan capital of the planet.
3854360	3859320	And when you look at the statue of Prometheus at Rockefeller Center,
3860840	3864520	it's Prometheus emerging from a rock
3867880	3877080	soaring through the celestial equator crossing the plane of the zodiac. So it's the
3877080	3883320	ecliptic and the zodiac and Prometheus is soaring through that emerging from out of a rock.
3883880	3892040	Well, the crossing of the celestial equator and the and the, you know, zodiac, plane of the zodiac
3893480	3901560	is the main symbol of Mithraism because Mithra grabs hold of the wheel work of the heavens
3901560	3908680	and shifts, you know, the sphere of the heavens creating the procession of the equinoxes
3909560	3919480	as he overpowers Zorvan or Kronos. Again, like Prometheus siding with Zeus to overthrow Kronos,
3919480	3926840	right? And then in the myths of Mithras, there are two versions of the myth of the birth of Mithras.
3927960	3932440	One of them is that he was born of a virgin, but that's the less popular version that then,
3932440	3937880	you know, influenced Christianity. The more popular version was that Mithra was born of a rock
3938680	3946440	he was born from out of a rock. Yeah. And moreover, in Mithraism, there is this stage of initiation,
3947880	3955160	penultimate stage of initiation, heliodromous, where the stage of the solar charioteer, where the
3955160	3964040	solar charioteer goes up there into the heavens and sets the world on fire, throws fire down. You
3964040	3969640	know, that praise from Jesus and the Gospels, I have come to cast fire upon the earth, right?
3969640	3974840	And so that's taken from this great initiation in Mithraism, where there's a casting of fire
3974840	3982920	down upon the earth from heaven. In the Greek, it's fire from Arunos. Fire from Arunos. And then
3982920	3988840	Elijah also says that too. And it's funny because Arunos is translated as heaven, but he's also a
3988840	3993880	god, the sky god, the heavens god. And he's a father of the, isn't he like the grandfather of the
3993880	4004520	Titans or something like that? Yes. So that's, that's right. And so, so, you know, Prometheus is
4004520	4012440	grandfather, right? grandfather Prometheus, who together with Gaia sired the Titans. And so in
4012440	4016920	the statue at Rockefeller Center, you see this flame in the hand of Prometheus. But here's the
4017000	4022200	thing. Prometheus, he's soaring up from the rock. So he's born out of the rock like Mithra.
4022200	4028760	He's soaring up over the crossing of the ecliptic and the plane of the zodiac like Mithra. And he's,
4028760	4034440	so he's in the heavens now, and he's holding this flame. And you have to, he's not holding a torch
4034440	4038520	bringing the fire to mankind, although obviously that's implied. It's Prometheus, right? Yeah.
4039080	4044040	Holding this flame in his hand, almost as if he's about to cast it down onto the earth.
4045000	4051240	So yet again, it's a reference to the myth of Mithra, particularly the grade of Chileodromos or
4051240	4056280	the solar chariots here, which is an image of a future fiery apocalypse of the earth that comes
4056280	4063000	from out of ancient Iranian religion. And so you were mentioning, how did I get here? The elites
4063000	4068440	and Prometheus, whoever designed that statue, I mean, man ship is credited with that statue,
4068440	4074440	but who told them to design it that way? And you know, what role did David Rockefeller have or
4074440	4083400	people around him? Whatever they were thinking, they knew that Prometheus is Mithra. They're the
4083400	4090120	same figure. I can see that too. This is an esoteric truth that's known by certain occult elites
4090120	4096600	throughout history, that Prometheus, the Titan, is the Titan Mithra. And you know, Mithra,
4097240	4103400	in the Indo-European religions, you always have this division between the gods and the Titans that
4103400	4109880	exists in every form of Indo-European religion. And in the Indo-Iranian branch, there is, like in
4109880	4115720	the Greek branch, this division between the Ahuras or Ashuras and the Devas, the Titans and the gods.
4115720	4124600	And Mithra is the most important of the Titans. So at war with Indra, who is this kind of thunderbolt
4124600	4133000	wielding Zeus-like figure among the Pantheon of the gods, among the Devas. So okay, you have that.
4133000	4138120	But where were we? We were talking about Escalus. And I just wanted to also mention the fact that
4139880	4145320	Escalus served in the Persian wars. And one of the other plays that he's famous for is the play
4145320	4152040	The Persians. He wrote a play The Persians. And you know, we were just talking about the invention
4152040	4160440	of perspective by Escalus in the context of, you know, his crafting of the art form of tragedy,
4160440	4167640	tragic drama. And it's interesting that in the Persians, Escalus is able to take the
4167640	4174040	perspective of the Persians. The Persians doesn't trash the Persians. It's a relatively sympathetic
4174040	4183560	portrayal of the Persians, including of Xerxes as a kind of tragic figure who, yeah, he suffers from
4183560	4191080	hubris. But so does Prometheus. And Prometheus is the hero of the Prometheus trilogy, which we only
4191080	4195960	we only have Prometheus bound left. But originally it was Prometheus the Firebringer,
4195960	4201560	Prometheus bound, and then Prometheus unbound. It's like Dark Knight, the trilogy. You have Dark
4201560	4206200	Knight, and he rises and then yeah. Exactly. Prometheus unbound was supposed to be the part
4206200	4211160	where Hercules comes and frees him, right, and so on kills the eagle and all that. And so this was
4211160	4218360	this great trilogy. It was the first proper drama of the Western world. And Prometheus was the first
4218360	4225960	tragic hero of the Western world. And so when he writes The Persians, and he depicts Xerxes as this
4226040	4231640	kind of tragic figure who suffers from his hubris, suffers a downfall on account of his hubris,
4233080	4237880	he's in a way almost empathizing with the enemy that he fought against on the battlefield
4237880	4242920	as a soldier in the Persian wars. He got into the mind of the enemy, and he was able to write this
4242920	4248600	drama, which, you know, portrays the Persians as something other than a cardboard cut out.
4249400	4253320	And that's also quite fascinating. And I don't think it's incidental at all,
4253960	4261480	that Prometheus gets valorized as a heroic figure, as a not just creator, but champion and benefactor
4261480	4268120	of mankind against the tyrannical and unjust God at just the time when the Persian Empire takes over
4268120	4277320	a large part of Greece. Askelos is living in a Persian dominated Greece. Yes, the Athenians are
4277320	4282520	still resisting, but most of Greece is under Persian rule at this time. And the cities where
4282520	4290440	philosophy is getting off the ground are all Persian ruled cities. And so, you know, not only
4290440	4295960	does the Prometheus myth have an Indo-European kernel in the myth of Amirani, there's a reevaluation
4295960	4302520	of Prometheus in Greek culture, where he goes from being this, the story of Prometheus goes from being
4302520	4314360	this, how can I put it, warning against defying the gods, a kind of morality tale that is meant to
4314360	4319800	emphasize the power of Zeus, which is what you get in Hesiod, and the earliest presentation of
4319800	4327000	Prometheus, to the Prometheus of Eskelos, who is a tragic hero. What's responsible for that almost
4327160	4333000	moral inversion that takes place that what Nietzsche would call reevaluation of values,
4333000	4339080	what's responsible for that? Well, the Persian colonization of Greece, because from the Persian
4339080	4348600	Zoroastrian or Mithraic perspective, Zeus is Ahreman and Prometheus is Ahura Mazda and or Mithra.
4349880	4354680	And so, you can see reflected in the reevaluation of Prometheus as a hero,
4355480	4363240	a Greek assimilation of Persian ideas, which then becomes fundamental for the whole developmental
4363240	4369160	trajectory of the Western world, you know, the developmental trajectory that Oswald Spengler
4369160	4377560	winds up calling Faustian. Spengler calls the West Faustian on the basis of Goethe's Faust,
4377560	4383240	Goethe's popularization of this alchemist, medieval alchemist who makes a deal with the
4383240	4389800	devil and so on and so forth, right? And basically, you know, usurps godly powers.
4390440	4397000	But in fact, Goethe, the author of Faust, admitted that in the dark night of his soul,
4397960	4408840	at the time in his life where he felt most alone and alienated and aggrieved, he looked to Prometheus
4408840	4417320	as his personal savior. Goethe wrote a, attempted to write a drama on Prometheus and he has a poem
4417320	4425640	that survived a fragmentary poem about Prometheus. And so Goethe, who's, you know, in hindsight,
4425640	4433000	through Spengler, responsible for coining the term the Faustian world to refer to the West,
4433880	4436440	Goethe actually admitted that Prometheus was his god.
4437800	4443160	Wow. That's what I wanted to get to in a second. But before I get to, I was going to ask you,
4443160	4447720	what's Prometheus, the state of Prometheus right now? What's his fate? Does he die? Does
4447720	4451400	is he ruin the world right now? What are your thoughts on that? But I also want to get into
4451400	4456920	the Gnost, how this trickles down into Gnostic theology. Which one do you think is, which one
4456920	4464680	should we tackle first? Well, they're deeply interrelated, okay, because, and okay, let me,
4464680	4475240	let me try to condense, you know, a rather complex and large scale observation into something as
4475240	4480600	concise as possible. And that's that just from, you know, the elements that we've already looked
4480600	4488680	at in the myth of Prometheus, you can see how this is a prototype for a lot of Gnostic mythology
4488680	4493320	and for the idea of the Gnostic savior, and for rebellion against the Archons and so on and so
4493320	4500200	forth. And you have the imagery of this, the serpent coiled around the tree as evil, whereas in
4500200	4507960	this, um, polemicized, you know, what do you, what do you say, Tannock, I guess, because it's
4508040	4513080	opposing it. This is the symbol of wisdom and knowledge. And for some reason, one's bad,
4513080	4520360	one's evil. And it's like, what's, they're at odds here. So yeah. Yes. And so very long story
4520360	4529800	short. And if you want to, to see my more in depth analysis of this in Prometheus, I get into this
4529800	4535240	in greater detail. And also, believe it or not, in my book, Closer Encounters, I wrote a book on
4535240	4541400	the UFO phenomenon called Closer Encounters. And it's a bit of a tome. It's a comprehensive
4541400	4547080	analysis of the entire close encounter phenomenon. And in chapter six, in the penultimate chapter
4547080	4553880	of that book, I get into Christianity in depth and detail and the genesis of the, the, the Christ
4553880	4563160	mythos. Okay. And how it is a form of social engineering, uh, by means of cognitive dissonance.
4563960	4572760	So in the Christ mythos, you have on the one hand Jesus in the gospels very clearly saying
4572760	4579560	that Jehovah is his father, that he's there to represent Yahweh. Yahweh is his father.
4580200	4588040	And in fact, not a dot of an I or a cross of a T from the Tanakh, the Old Testament, will pass out
4588040	4596280	of existence or out of relevance until the end of the world. And so Jesus speaking through one side
4596280	4603160	of his mouth affirms all the legalism of the Old Testament and takes pride in being the son
4603960	4611720	of this genocidal, tyrannical maniac sadist who is responsible for Moses' slaughter of these poor
4611720	4617160	golden calf worshipping, dancing Israelites in the Sinai Desert, who's responsible for the genocide
4617160	4622840	at Jericho, who's responsible for like just all the most horrendous, brutally inhuman acts you
4622840	4628680	can imagine, um, that are chronicled throughout the Old Testament. And of course, for all the
4628680	4635320	wonderful laws and Leviticus and Deuteronomy, right? I mean, the most like despicably inhuman,
4635960	4644680	uh, legal code and, um, basically structure of theocratic authority that we've seen in human
4644680	4651240	history. And so Jesus on the one hand is coming to validate all of that. And when you look at Jesus
4651240	4655560	from that perspective, you know, through those particular verses in the gospels, then the only
4655640	4661160	problem, sure, he says to the Jews, you know, you, you're, you're disinherited. The kingdom doesn't
4661160	4666120	belong to you anymore. It belongs to humanity. It belongs to anyone who follows my father, right?
4666120	4670440	From that perspective, his only problem with the Jews is the same problem that Yahweh had with the
4670440	4675000	Jews throughout the whole Old Testament, where Yahweh keeps telling these Jews, you rebellious
4675000	4679160	people never learn a lesson. He says they're uniquely rebellious people, right? Cause they
4679160	4683880	keep disobeying somehow, called them stiff neck people. Yep. Neck Israelites. They keep setting
4683880	4688760	up idols of various kinds of worshiping ish tar and ball and this one and that one. Okay.
4688760	4692600	And so Jesus's problem with the Jews is, is just that it's that, look,
4693320	4698040	Yahweh's had enough with your stiff, stiff neck rebelliousness. And so you're disinherited. You're
4698040	4702760	not the chosen people anymore. And the kingdom belongs, belongs to anybody who submits to Yahweh
4702760	4709160	through me. So that's one Jesus. And that's the Jesus that, you know, for all the differences
4709240	4717560	between Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Protestantism, including the evangelical churches
4717560	4721880	in the United States, for all the various doctrinal differences between these warring sects of
4721880	4727320	Christianity, all of them accept that version of Jesus in one way or another. That's the
4727320	4732760	institutional Jesus. And then you have this Gnostic Jesus. And what is this not? And there are
4732760	4737640	verses in the Gospels that support that too. Absolutely. All verses in the Gnostic Gospels.
4737640	4742120	And what the Gospels that were rejected at Nicaea, right? And what does this Jesus tell you?
4742120	4747000	Well, this Jesus tells you, I mean, that, you know, the law, you don't need to follow the law
4747000	4754040	as long as, you know, you, you, yeah, it's about the spirit and not the law. And
4755000	4760280	the world is a fallen material creation anyway. And Jesus is here to free you from the world,
4760280	4764840	because just like him, you're not of the world. And the world was created by these inferior
4764920	4769560	archons and not by the true God. And he's the way to find the true God and so on and so forth.
4769560	4777880	Yeah. But here's the thing. The Gnostic version of Christianity is pacifist. Yeah.
4779960	4785160	The Gnostic Jesus is a radical pacifist who rejects political rebellion.
4787160	4791880	To the extent that you embrace the legalistic Jesus that affirms Yahweh in the Old Testament,
4791880	4796360	maybe you could see that Jesus as a kind of political rebel. But if you go in the Gnostic
4796360	4801000	direction, then you're really emphasizing the pacifistic passages in the Gospels. And so
4801000	4808520	Gnosticism, Christian Gnosticism is a doctrine of pacifism. Why? Because this is a fallen world
4808520	4813880	governed by archons. And to the extent that you participate in political power, you are being
4813880	4821640	corrupted by archons, power is inherently corrupting from a Gnostic perspective. And if you ask me,
4821640	4825240	and I've laid this argument out at length in my various writings, like I just said,
4826520	4835000	this is cognitive dissonance. This is a doctrine directed to demoralize and
4837000	4843880	degenerate society. Because first of all, you're left in an intellectual contradiction.
4843880	4848280	You're left in an intellectual contradiction. Do I follow the Old Testament? Don't I follow
4848280	4853000	the Old Testament? This Jesus keeps contradicting himself, which then it screws with your head.
4853000	4857160	It's cognitive dissonance. You're made to believe, you're made to take on faith
4857880	4861080	two things that are contradictory to believe them at the same time.
4862040	4867880	Yeah. And what does that do? It puts you in a mental state where you're suffering extreme
4867880	4875160	tension. And in order to resolve that tension, you will latch on to anything as a life raft.
4875160	4876760	It's a psychological tactic.
4876760	4880360	It becomes a buffet of ideas that you can just pick and choose from. You know what?
4880360	4884920	Real quick, I just want to jump in real quick. Because one of the oldest monasteries that was
4884920	4890120	abandoned when Islam took over the Byzantine Eastern Empire, right next to where they thought
4890120	4895400	Mount Sinai was, which I don't know if it really is or not. But anyway, there was a monastery there.
4895400	4900200	And there's one of the oldest depictions of Jesus in the world that they found in this place.
4900200	4904520	And they figured out that if you mirror one side of Jesus's face, you get a perfect image.
4904520	4906760	And if you mirror the other side, you get a perfect image.
4906760	4912200	They're imposing two different faces on Jesus's face to show his dual nature.
4912200	4915640	So the early Christians knew what you're saying right now. This wasn't a secret.
4917080	4922360	This whole idea of putting a Bible in one spot and making a canon wasn't even a thing.
4922360	4928680	Marcian had his own gospel. He picked and choose what Jesus wanted to have in his own Bible.
4928680	4931880	The Gnostics had their own Jesus. The other guys had their own Jesus.
4931880	4935400	It wasn't until later that they put it all in one spot. And that's how you get this
4936520	4940280	weird schizophrenic message. But yeah, but to add to that.
4940280	4949480	But here's my point, Neil, is that regardless of which Jesus you go for, neither the institutional
4950600	4956600	legalistic Jesus, who is the son of Yahweh, nor the antinomian Gnostic savior,
4956840	4968280	is a figure who inspires active rebellion against unjust divinities, let's say.
4968280	4973480	Not to call them gods, right? The beings that become God and the angels for the Christians
4973480	4980360	and used to be Zeus and the Olympians for the Greeks, right? Neither image of Jesus
4981320	4986360	inspires active, meaning political rebellion against the unjust rule of heaven.
4987400	4993400	So Gnosticism is inherently disempowering. Christian Gnosticism is debilitating
4994600	5000040	because of its pacifism, because of the association of power inherently with the Arkons.
5000760	5005960	Whereas in the myth of Prometheus, you see a prototype for all of the most positive elements
5006040	5015240	of Gnosticism. But you see them in a context which totally rejects pacifism and calls for a militant
5017080	5022520	resistance against the unjust tyranny of heaven over the earth. And a demand for the
5022520	5032200	self-determination of mankind. So in that sense, Prometheism, a kind of theism based on Prometheus,
5033160	5041320	the spirituality that's implicit in the myth of Prometheus, is protonostic, but it's satanic.
5042520	5049000	And this brings me to the other aspect of your question about where is Prometheus today,
5049000	5056200	what happened with Prometheus later. And so we see a reappropriation of the myth of Prometheus
5057160	5063080	at the dawn of the modern age, where you have Romantic poets, I mentioned Dutta earlier,
5064200	5072680	also Lord Byron, who writes a poem about Prometheus. And then most famously Byron's best friend,
5072680	5080040	Percy Shelley, who writes Prometheus Unbound, which is a four act play,
5080760	5087240	about the whole mythos of Prometheus, including the parts of the story that were lost in the
5087240	5092680	version of Escalus, about Prometheus ultimately being freed from his chains and so on and so forth.
5092680	5099880	And one really interesting thing about the Prometheus Unbound play written by Percy Shelley
5099880	5107720	around 1820, is that he uses all Latin names for the characters. Like he uses Jupiter instead of
5107720	5114840	Zeus, or Mercury instead of Hermes, but not for Prometheus. And what would Prometheus be in Latin?
5115400	5122680	Lucifer. And he makes it abundantly clear, Shelley does, that the flood, you know, the flood that
5122680	5131080	Ducalion helps save some portion of mankind from, is the flood of Noah. And that the civilization
5131080	5138680	that was destroyed by Yahweh was Atlantis, is the Greek Atlantis, the ruins of Atlantis at the
5138680	5145320	bottom of the ocean, feature in Shelley's Prometheus Unbound play. And so Shelley underlines the fact
5145320	5153240	that Prometheus is deeply connected to Atlantis. It's not accidental that, or incidental, that
5153880	5161720	the king of Atlantis is named Atlas. So Atlantis means the realm of Atlas. That's where the name
5161720	5168520	Atlantis comes from. It means the realm of Atlas, because Poseidia was ruled by a king called Atlas.
5168520	5175480	In fact, the kings were all called Atlas. And so I'm guessing this was a title, not a proper name
5175480	5180920	of a person. And the person who was the sovereign of Atlantis was given this title,
5181560	5189000	in reference to the brother of Prometheus, namely the Titan Atlas, who leads the Titans in
5189000	5195560	war against the gods. He's the general of the Titan army in the Titanomachia. And what do the
5195560	5201160	Atlanteans do? The core of the myth of Atlantis, the Plato recounts for us in Timaeus and Critias,
5201160	5208440	is that the Atlanteans lead a war against the Limpus. They attempt to unify the whole earth
5208440	5214680	under their naval rule. And they're no longer worshiping the gods. They've become totally
5214680	5220200	irreverent toward the Olympians. And this is why when they're on the brink of unifying the whole
5220200	5228920	earth, Zeus decides to wipe them off the face of the planet with this deluge. So Shelley,
5228920	5236360	in Prometheus' Unbound, depicts the destruction of Atlantis. And he makes it quite clear that this
5236360	5244600	is a parallel to the biblical flood story. And he's associating Prometheus with the rebel angels,
5244600	5252120	with the fallen angels, who were punished by Yahweh. And so, point being, in the modern era,
5252120	5262840	you see authors like Götta, Lord Byron, and Percy Shelley explicitly appropriate the myth of Prometheus
5263560	5276280	as a positive image of Satan. People often talk about Satan as an entirely negative figure
5277160	5283160	that cannot be dissociated from Christianity, that's predicated on Christianity, that's parasitic
5283160	5290600	on Christianity. But folks, there's a Satan before Satan, and that's Prometheus. And one place that
5290600	5296520	this becomes abundantly clear is in the modern Prometheus. You ask about where is Prometheus
5296520	5302120	today? Where is Prometheus in the modern age? Well, look, the alternate title for Frankenstein,
5302120	5309880	the subtitle of the book, is the modern Prometheus. So Percy's wife, Mary Shelley, pens this tale in
5309880	5317720	which we have an extremely Luciferian depiction of Dr. Frankenstein as the modern Prometheus.
5318680	5326200	And so, you know, we're on the verge of a new world with AI and virtual reality and all this
5326760	5332040	cutting edge technology that's really going to change everything. Like, we're right on the
5332040	5337640	border of what's about to happen. Yes, and Frankenstein was the first of these great sci-fi stories
5337640	5343880	that involved transhuman technologies. And you can see the debt to Frankenstein or the modern
5343880	5348600	Prometheus throughout the history of modern science fiction, up to and including Ridley Scott's
5348600	5354600	Prometheus. Ridley Scott's film in 2012, Prometheus, the prequel to the alien saga,
5355800	5362840	is very much a retelling of Frankenstein in a cosmic context. So the myth of Prometheus,
5362840	5367320	I would say, is very much alive. Yeah. Well, especially if you combine it with Mithra, because
5367320	5372360	we live in a legalistic age, everything we do is all, you know, sign this document, you know,
5372360	5378120	make sure that everything's lawful. Like, no, but you have like banking systems and we have systems
5378120	5386840	in place, PayPal, it's all mediators and signing on the dotted line and technology. It really is
5386840	5393400	in a spiritual sense, whether you, however you want to interpret this, it's a world ruled by
5393400	5403240	Prometheus hyphen Mithra. Yeah. And the point is to take back this technology to,
5404840	5413640	you know, reintegrate these capacities that we were gifted with by Prometheus for the sake of
5413640	5419400	fostering human flourishing, rather than allowing ourselves to be dehumanized by this technology.
5419400	5427240	Right. Prometheus brought the gift of technique to man so that we could determine our own destiny,
5427800	5432440	not so that we could wind up being instrumentalized into something like the board, not so that,
5432440	5439320	you know, AI could ensconce us in such a fashion as to, you know, divest us of our humanity and,
5439880	5446360	you know, leave us with a hive mind. So, you know, right now we are at the 11th hour,
5446360	5451560	we're at a key turning point in the face of the technological singularity where we have to
5452760	5461480	basically retrieve the poetic power of the Prometheus myth and to understand technological
5461480	5469240	science in the right way as a tool to empower our evolution so that we can transform, you know,
5469240	5475320	like that caterpillar in the chrysalis into the butterfly, the butterfly that appears
5476040	5480760	at the creation of humanity in the myth of Prometheus. And so I would say that, you know,
5482280	5490520	Prometheus is a figure that represents the promise of technological science,
5492120	5496280	but there's also this shadow side, this Frankensteinian danger that we face,
5496920	5501480	right, approaching this technological singularity within this very century.
5502840	5508120	And so it's more important than ever right now to positively re-appropriate this myth
5508120	5514040	and understand the power that it already has over us unconsciously. We need to take that
5514040	5519960	unconscious power, that demonic power, of the Prometheus archetype over our society
5519960	5524760	and transform it into something that's more self-conscious and that can be directed in a
5524760	5532040	positive manner as a force of liberation and enlightenment. Yeah, and do you think
5532760	5537880	for in the context of like, I don't know, maybe climate change, for example, like,
5537880	5545000	if there's some sort of, some sort of threat of some disaster on earth, Prometheus being the
5545000	5550680	archetype of this, the only thing that can save us is, you know, we have to figure out a way through
5550760	5555960	technology to get ourselves right, maybe, I don't know, go off into space or something,
5555960	5560360	I don't even know what that is, but that also represents this sort of butterfly effect of
5560360	5565720	like a metamorphosis of the human nature, of humanity. Like, we need to change something,
5565720	5569800	or else if we keep going down this path, it's done, we're done, we're going to be wiped out,
5570440	5576440	right? Absolutely, that's right. But we also need to remember that, so, you know, retreat,
5576440	5581720	ludditism and retreat back to nature and to pre-industrial society and all this crap that's
5581720	5587320	being promoted by a lot of elites today, right, the eco-friendly lifestyle. No, no, no, no, we
5587320	5593000	can use technology to save the ecosystem. But the other thing we have to remember is that Prometheus
5593000	5600040	didn't just give us the fire of the forge, the fire that he gifted mankind with is also the fountain
5600040	5607880	head of all of the arts and crafts. In other words, literature, painting, right, drama,
5608840	5617240	as per Escalus. So there is a unity of science and art that, you know, is at the core of the
5617240	5626440	myth of Prometheus. And we need to cultivate that aesthetic sensibility so that we use technology
5626440	5632840	in ways that are poetic, in ways that are not alienating and instrumentalizing, but that are
5632840	5640040	part of the expansion of the creative capacity of humanity. Because Prometheus is also the deity
5640040	5648680	of the arts, of literature, of poetry. And that's something that we shouldn't lose sight of, right,
5648680	5654360	as we enter this crucible of the technological singularity, we are going to need to be more
5654360	5661960	artful than ever before. So that we use technology as a tool for liberation and empowerment,
5661960	5665000	rather than allowing it to be an instrument of dehumanization.
5665560	5672600	Yeah, I think the idea of becoming like gods, by copying what's in nature onto technology,
5672600	5679640	we can create systems of travel or whatever, that is just beyond our even capacity to even think
5680280	5684440	how great we can be right now, you know? As Shelley says, and this is a good note to end on,
5684440	5694440	as Shelley says in Prometheus Unbound, we can come up with arts as of yet undreamed of, arts
5694440	5700760	that have been, haven't even been conceived by the mind of the gods, right? And so it's not a
5700760	5705640	question of copying nature, it's a question of bettering nature, we can do better than nature,
5705640	5711640	we can do better than the gods, we can improve upon nature. And so therefore you see that from a
5711640	5717320	Christian perspective, right, even including a Gnostic Christian perspective, because the Gnostic
5717320	5721320	doesn't want to improve this world, the Gnostic wants to escape this world. From a Christian
5721320	5729240	perspective, Gnostic or otherwise, this is Satanic. The idea that we can do better than the gods,
5729240	5735240	we can best God more nature, that is the core of the Prometheus-ness.
5735240	5742040	It's eating the fruit of knowledge, literally. It's accepting, and by the way, it's also reflected
5742040	5749960	in Persephone eating the pomegranate, it's like a mirror of that. But speaking of taking the fruit
5749960	5755720	of knowledge, you have just attained true Gnosis. And by the way, check out Jason Rezegerd on his
5755720	5760280	books on Amazon, links are in the description. You have just attained true Gnosis.
5763160	5766280	The Demiurge has no power over you.
