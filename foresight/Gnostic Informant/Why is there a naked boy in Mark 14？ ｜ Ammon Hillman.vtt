00:30.000 --> 01:00.000
and welcome back to a new episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of

01:00.000 --> 01:06.880
this week's episode of this episode of our combination of 2 season 2 and you're

01:06.880 --> 01:13.040
about to attain trunosis. And today we're going to talk about the question I've been asking

01:13.040 --> 01:21.320
Bible scholars for years and I cannot get to the bottom of this question. And there, if

01:21.320 --> 01:27.800
it's about Mark 14 the grandest chapter of all the chapter is Mark. Mark is the first

01:27.800 --> 01:32.120
most important gospel, in my opinion, is the mystery, the mystery being revealed.

01:32.120 --> 01:39.240
But when we get to chapter 14, all of a sudden, all these mysterious things are happening.

01:39.240 --> 01:45.960
Jesus' feet are being anointed. The Peter is being told that the cock will crow three times,

01:45.960 --> 01:53.240
and then he will deny Jesus. And all these weird stuff that doesn't make sense in English.

01:54.200 --> 02:00.440
And so I decided, if the Bible scholars aren't telling me what's going on at the end of Mark 14

02:00.440 --> 02:07.960
with this little boy in the Garden of Gethsemane running away naked as Jesus is being arrested

02:07.960 --> 02:13.880
by Judas and people bearing the torches, if the Bible scholars can't tell me what's going on here,

02:13.880 --> 02:18.600
I'm going to turn it into the classicists. Because the classicists, they know the Greek.

02:19.560 --> 02:23.160
So you can't learn a lot about classical Greek through the Koinei,

02:23.160 --> 02:25.960
but you can learn a lot about the Koinei through the classical Greek because the

02:25.960 --> 02:30.200
Koinei comes out of classical Greek. Does that make sense? So with that being said,

02:30.200 --> 02:33.800
before we get into anything, I just want to let you guys know Lady Babylon.

02:34.520 --> 02:41.640
Go and subscribe. Nobody on the internet is going as deep as Dr. Amon, who is my guest today.

02:42.360 --> 02:43.880
Dr. Amon, how are you doing today?

02:46.040 --> 02:50.120
Great, great, Neil. Thanks for having me. It's so nice to be here.

02:51.320 --> 02:55.320
Absolutely. I'm looking forward to this. Links in the description for the channel.

02:55.320 --> 02:58.840
Go and subscribe. And it's one of some of the best stuff out there.

02:58.840 --> 03:05.560
Some of the, like I said, there's different types of scholars and you and people like Dr. Ruck

03:06.280 --> 03:11.480
who are not afraid to step on people's toes and get a little dirty once in a while.

03:11.480 --> 03:17.880
This is where it's at Lady Babylon. And yeah, check it out. But let's get into this topic of

03:18.520 --> 03:25.880
Mark 14. What is this? I'm actually going to let you take it away for a little bit.

03:25.880 --> 03:30.840
I'll jump in with a few questions here and there. But this is something that needs to be explained

03:31.880 --> 03:35.320
a little more than just a couple of sentences. We need to go through, let's go through the Greek

03:35.320 --> 03:40.200
systematically and describe what's going on here. And then maybe we can come to a conclusion.

03:42.200 --> 03:48.120
Yeah, that's my, that's my bag to nail. I love it when you call up the sources and you're just

03:48.120 --> 03:53.880
like, let's just look at what they said and see what we can gather from what they're saying.

03:53.880 --> 03:59.800
We just listen in for a moment. So let's jump right into those sources. I want to, Neil knows,

03:59.800 --> 04:06.520
I want to bring you the apocalypse, right? I want to show you. I want that thing revealed.

04:07.320 --> 04:13.880
I want that sacred made profane so that you can get in there and Jesus's world

04:13.880 --> 04:20.040
right there with him and see him for what he is. So let's go to the, let's go to the very first

04:20.680 --> 04:24.840
passage. This is Mark, right? We're taking the Gospels here. Yeah.

04:25.800 --> 04:43.480
And there was this kid, some kid was with him. And this verb soon accoluthae, right?

04:44.440 --> 04:51.960
From soon accoluthae. Oh, this verb is what you talk about when you talk about slaves being assigned

04:52.040 --> 05:00.680
to someone. So there's some slave kid assigned to him. Yeah. And he's petty, this is from Perry

05:00.680 --> 05:09.560
Balo. Nice, nice, you know, standard, standard Greek just means to throw and Perry means around.

05:10.200 --> 05:16.200
Yeah. He's thrown around himself. He's using something. What is he using? Seendona.

05:17.000 --> 05:23.160
He's using a Seendona. And we have the word here for Seendona. This is everybody knows this

05:23.160 --> 05:29.080
passage. This kid with this thing. Can we see some, Neil, can we see some of the,

05:29.720 --> 05:35.080
yeah, look what kind of translations we have. Yeah. I just pulled out a whole plethora of

05:35.080 --> 05:40.680
English so that nobody can say, but what about this one? Here we have all laid out for us.

05:40.760 --> 05:46.520
Yeah. The NIV down to the King James. It says, oh, I'm sorry, this is the wrong verse. Okay, sorry.

05:47.320 --> 05:54.680
Here, a young man wearing nothing but a linen garment was following Jesus. But if I'm not mistaken,

05:54.680 --> 06:03.720
young man, we're talking, the word Neo, Neoniscos is young boy. Isn't that the right

06:03.720 --> 06:08.920
correction, correct translation for that? It comes from the root, it comes from the root,

06:08.920 --> 06:17.320
Neil, Neos, and that is the idea of the budding. The idea is not a specific age group. Could this

06:17.320 --> 06:25.160
kid be an early teenager? Hmm. It's the bud. He's in the, in the, in the newness of his life.

06:25.720 --> 06:31.560
And that's important because remember, it's their world, not our world. We're imposing our view on

06:31.560 --> 06:39.080
it, right? They're looking at this budding kid wearing nothing, right? Put a linen garment.

06:39.720 --> 06:44.840
Ooh, that's a little bit of a stretch, right? A garment. Doesn't say garment there, right?

06:44.840 --> 06:51.800
Linen shirt. Look at the next one. A linen shirt. Oh, yeah. Nothing but a linen cloth. Yeah, right?

06:51.800 --> 06:57.240
See all the different kind of clothing that you end up getting in this, right? Because we want to

06:57.240 --> 07:03.400
dress Jesus, but hey, let's pull up Alice, Neil, like, you know, we love to do. And let's see,

07:03.400 --> 07:09.640
let's see what that seam done is. Look at this. So seam done is the linen cloth of the translation

07:09.640 --> 07:14.360
that we're looking at. But this is, this is from Persia's top. So we'd like to call Alice,

07:15.000 --> 07:19.640
because we're going into Alice Wonderland. We're going into the sources. This is all the times

07:19.640 --> 07:29.960
his words use in the context. Fine cloth, usually linen, okay? Use for mummies. Surgeon bandages.

07:30.760 --> 07:34.280
Wait a minute. Herodotus uses this word. I don't know if you guys know how to read

07:34.280 --> 07:42.840
the Perseus Toss, but there you see that HDT 286. Herodotus in book two, verse 86,

07:42.840 --> 07:51.960
use this word for a surgeon bandage. And what's cool, Neil, is Helen talks about these drugs.

07:51.960 --> 07:55.960
I was a grad student trying to figure this out. And one day I was reading a text that said they

07:55.960 --> 08:04.440
take this bandage and they impregnate it, they put the medicine in it, and then wrap the wound.

08:04.440 --> 08:10.440
And okay, so anyway, let's go back to the passage. It's a band, right?

08:10.680 --> 08:15.640
This is a medical use for it. So you're saying Galen uses this word for medical.

08:16.920 --> 08:24.440
Yes, and not just Galen, right? But it's just referring to a strip of cloth. And this kid,

08:24.440 --> 08:30.200
if you go back to our original text, that first one, this kid is wearing it. He's seen very

08:30.200 --> 08:39.080
specifically, he says epigumnu on his place of shame, on his place of shame. He's wearing it,

08:39.080 --> 08:52.440
right? Let's keep reading it. Let's keep reading it. And they took possession of him.

08:52.440 --> 08:59.480
They arrested him. They strong armed him. There it's talking about Jesus. Typically,

08:59.480 --> 09:04.920
they try to say this was the boy. But it doesn't make sense if it's the boy with the next Greek

09:04.920 --> 09:19.320
that we have. The one who was naked fled after leaving his bandage. Yeah, right? Why? Because

09:19.320 --> 09:26.120
they're not trying to strong arm the kid, right? They're trying to strong arm Jesus.

09:26.760 --> 09:34.680
And that's when Jesus says so importantly, which is our next text. Check out this next text.

09:35.240 --> 09:42.600
This one? Yeah. Yeah. And Jesus answers them, right? And he said to them, did you come out here

09:42.600 --> 09:54.120
against me as if I were a laystace? Having your clubs and your weapons, you know, you're going

09:54.120 --> 10:00.360
to take me this way? Yeah, your clubs and your swords, right? What are you doing? It's that famous

10:00.360 --> 10:08.840
passage. But everybody remembers the laystace, Robert or the pirate, right? Jesus is saying,

10:08.840 --> 10:15.160
I'm a pirate, right? Look there at the very bottom under Roman numer number two. Yeah. And you see the

10:15.160 --> 10:25.080
cupris, the pirate of Cyprus. Oh, the reference, the reference and lycophron to 1143, where we

10:25.160 --> 10:36.200
are talking about abducting young women to be sold to others for things like slavery,

10:38.120 --> 10:45.080
sexual gratification, you can sell to a temple, they could have been sold off as priestesses,

10:45.720 --> 10:52.200
right? But these are Jesus does, you're not coming out against me like I'm with all these weapons,

10:52.280 --> 10:59.720
like I'm a some kind of child trafficker. So that's what he's saying with me says you're that I

10:59.720 --> 11:06.360
didn't know that that that brings a lot of context to what he's talking about. Yeah. Yeah. So now,

11:06.360 --> 11:13.480
you know, what about Jesus and child children and child sack of child trafficking? And is there

11:13.480 --> 11:19.880
anything else if we're just detectives saying this is the this is the evidence we have and from the

11:19.880 --> 11:25.160
Garden of Gethsemane, we have that one piece of evidence, we have that kid's

11:27.720 --> 11:35.880
penile wrap, we have the penile wrap of the child. Yeah, that's the only like fragment of history

11:35.880 --> 11:43.080
that was left at the scene, right? Otherwise, we know Jesus is saying he's not a pirate and he's

11:43.080 --> 11:52.360
got it covered with some stuff that you write that they don't know, right? We're not like look,

11:52.360 --> 11:59.400
we're not when it's not like we're pulling stuff out of our space, like the text tells us there's

11:59.400 --> 12:06.040
a little boy in him in with him in the garden, as he's being arrested, who runs away naked.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.600
Like we're this is not like we're not like going to like some apocryphal text somewhere and like

12:12.600 --> 12:19.400
pulling out some random this is in the text in Mark. And so we're just asking questions like

12:19.400 --> 12:25.480
what's going on here? Is it an initiation? Is there I've heard people say there was a resurrection,

12:25.480 --> 12:30.920
you know, they say, oh, you know, he wasn't there. He didn't go there with John and and whoever

12:30.920 --> 12:36.280
else was there. He just was there in the cemetery and Jesus resurrected him. I've heard that theory,

12:36.280 --> 12:41.160
but the text doesn't say that. We're just adding stuff to whatever we want to the text.

12:41.160 --> 12:47.880
The text doesn't say that. It only says there's a little boy who ran away naked. So what's going on

12:47.880 --> 12:54.280
here? And the best thing to do now that's why I love to hang with you is because it's just those

12:54.280 --> 13:00.520
texts that matter. I can come up with a theory for what's going on. It doesn't do me any good.

13:00.600 --> 13:05.880
If I just treat those texts, and that's what I want to jump. I want to jump. Okay, I didn't want to do

13:05.880 --> 13:12.680
this originally, but the last slide that the last. Yeah, there. Hey, guys, let's just I want to cut

13:12.680 --> 13:18.440
to the chase on this one. Look at this. This is I don't want to talk about the background of this

13:18.440 --> 13:24.600
thing whatsoever. People classify the pseudo climate. You can take that and deal with it. What

13:24.600 --> 13:32.200
you want. I'm interested in the language here and what what the Greek is saying. So yeah. So

13:38.120 --> 13:45.080
Jesus is mad, man, right right off the bat. And he came back with her, this woman to the garden

13:45.640 --> 13:53.960
where was the male? Where was the cemetery? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And right away he heard from the

13:53.960 --> 14:03.480
cemetery, right from this tomb on Phone Megali, a great voice and approaching. You know, Jesus

14:03.480 --> 14:10.600
moved off the stone from the doorway of the tomb and entering in there right there was this

14:10.600 --> 14:17.160
neoniskos. You can see this on the one, two, three, four, fifth line down. Neoniskos. See the

14:17.160 --> 14:24.280
neoniskos. Yeah, yeah. Okay. And there was a neoniskos there. And what is he doing? He's stretching

14:24.280 --> 14:34.920
out his hand and waking him up. Isn't that cool? He's waking. Wait, do you realize that we heard a

14:34.920 --> 14:45.160
voice and we entered a tomb where a kid has to be roused? Where he has to be roused? Okay. Wow.

14:45.160 --> 14:50.680
Thank you. Okay. Probably smells like opium in here, right? Okay.

14:54.280 --> 15:01.240
Right. Honeoniskos. And so the kid does what? He looks up at him and he loves him.

15:04.440 --> 15:11.640
He loves him. And remember, this is in a text that itself says, hey, Jesus was here a fan.

15:12.600 --> 15:19.560
Wake up, people. Jesus was a here a fan. And what is it? It's in the text, yeah. One who teaches

15:19.560 --> 15:26.440
the rites of sacrifice and worship, right? In Rome, it's just the pontiff. Herodotus uses it for

15:26.440 --> 15:34.600
the initiation at Elusis. Yes, yes. So this is a very specific role. We have another source from

15:34.600 --> 15:41.000
Plutarch says that this is what they call the pontifix maximus in Rome or the Jewish high priest.

15:41.000 --> 15:49.000
So this is somebody who's religious, who's doing rites, hero funds, specifically those mystical

15:49.000 --> 15:55.880
rites that we call the mystery, that we call the mystery. So if you go back to that text,

15:57.800 --> 16:03.000
here we go. Here we go. What is he doing? He's with the kid there and he rouses him up. The kid

16:03.000 --> 16:10.440
looking at him loves him. And Elxato Paracalene started to ask him that he might be with him.

16:11.960 --> 16:21.400
What? And coming out from the tomb, Jesus went into the home, the oikia, the estate

16:22.200 --> 16:31.320
of the kid for this kid was wealthy. He was loaded. And after six days, Jesus gave him

16:31.400 --> 16:40.280
instructions about how to look. And the kid came and wrapped around himself a scene done

16:45.240 --> 16:50.840
he wrapped his scene down on his nakedness. Yeah. And he remained with him.

16:51.160 --> 17:04.760
He remained with him for the night. Yeah, throughout the night. And now this is the kicker.

17:04.760 --> 17:17.800
This is the kicker right at the end. And that guard there is telling you why did he stay with the

17:17.800 --> 17:29.960
kid all night throughout the night? Because he was teaching him the musterion. Oh, mystery. Yeah.

17:31.960 --> 17:40.040
And that's, that's what the chapter is leading up to. It's this, this scene in the garden. Yeah. Yeah.

17:41.240 --> 17:44.920
I think it might be the longest chapter in Mark. I'm going to be wrong. It's one of the longest,

17:44.920 --> 17:51.800
at least, but it leads up to this. And it's, it's very mysterious. There's something happening here.

17:52.600 --> 17:58.440
And I think these, these Greek words are telling us, like, for example, you know, how we define

17:58.440 --> 18:06.440
Hierophant, teaching the rites or the Sindon wearing the Sindon. So I'm, and I'm thinking in my head,

18:06.440 --> 18:12.680
is there a relation to this? And this is another gospel, but like, I know this is like the

18:12.680 --> 18:16.760
scholars say, don't compare gospel to gospel. They're two different writers, but like,

18:16.760 --> 18:23.480
I can't help it. The, in John, you have the, the disciple whom Jesus loved. I wonder if this is

18:23.480 --> 18:29.560
Mark's way of telling about who this character is, some sort of initiate, some sort of apprentice, maybe.

18:32.520 --> 18:38.520
Yeah. And what's the connection with the boy having been assigned to Jesus? Like you buy a

18:38.600 --> 18:44.040
slave to do something for a certain amount of time, you know, he's renting the person.

18:44.840 --> 18:52.440
Right. And a lot of times the, these little kiddie slaves, they, they're involved in things that

18:52.440 --> 18:59.400
aren't just for kids. And you think for yourself, you're sitting there and you think, oh, wait a

18:59.400 --> 19:05.400
minute, I'm starting to make me a little bit nauseous. Yeah. Let's go back to the actual language.

19:05.960 --> 19:11.480
Right. Because Jesus has a point where some people get upset at him. It's some of his own

19:11.480 --> 19:19.240
followers and they say, Hey, stop treating the children like this says he was touching them.

19:19.240 --> 19:25.800
And the word there is grabbing and also hop to pull hop to up. Here it is. Hop to.

19:26.520 --> 19:32.200
I got it. Hop to. Yeah. Look at this people hop to. Can be, you know, it's not just touching

19:32.280 --> 19:41.160
like, you know, touching. It's grabbing, right? It's, it's engaging something or attacking something.

19:42.360 --> 19:47.880
Context and a wrestling. So yeah, that's a specific touch right there. And if, and if you look at number

19:47.880 --> 19:53.400
five under Roman numer, number three, you see that it means to have straight up intercourse.

19:53.400 --> 20:00.040
Oh my God. It can actually be used in that context. And it is used by Paul and Corinthians that way.

20:01.000 --> 20:09.000
Wow. Okay. So my mind is officially blown right now. For those of you who think, you know,

20:09.000 --> 20:13.160
for those of you who think, you know, coin a, Neil, can you take that off from

20:14.360 --> 20:19.880
an appeal of vanity? Oh yeah. One second. It's got to go back down. Okay. Go ahead.

20:19.880 --> 20:26.520
For those of you who don't think that, for those of you who think, you know, coin a.

20:27.240 --> 20:35.880
Yeah. Kick up your stuff because yeah, you're going to need it. You're going to need it. He was,

20:35.880 --> 20:44.120
so he's, he is in a situation where he's doing this to children and the, a group of his followers

20:44.120 --> 20:51.000
stopped the parents from allowing it to take place and they say, Hey, stop doing this. And it says

20:51.000 --> 20:57.320
they're upset and it uses Tima, which typically can be used in a kind of illegal sense. It's got

20:57.320 --> 21:04.280
just a smidge of something judges say, right? Now let's tell you that that it's used by judges.

21:05.640 --> 21:12.760
And so yeah. And so it's, it's a funny thing that they get these kids and Jesus steps up and

21:13.160 --> 21:19.320
he says, he's angry and he says, no, you cannot enter into the kingdom

21:21.000 --> 21:31.160
unless you are one of these children. Let's look at what he's talking about because it has this,

21:31.160 --> 21:36.520
it has just a, just for us, it's just like, no, no, no, don't think that, don't think that,

21:37.240 --> 21:43.960
right? But let's see what the Greeks were thinking. When he talks about his paideia,

21:43.960 --> 21:49.560
what are these paideia people don't realize, right? Little children are following around Jesus,

21:49.560 --> 21:59.720
why they need the prayer. He's going to, he's going to engage them. And he's going to enter into a

21:59.720 --> 22:09.560
prayer and we see this in the performance of the mystery. And of course, that's why Jesus is so

22:09.560 --> 22:16.440
out of this, you can't get into the kingdom unless you come by this avenue, right? Now,

22:16.440 --> 22:23.800
what is this paidzo? What is it? What is this child thing in the, in the ancient Greek mind and the

22:23.800 --> 22:30.280
ancient Mediterranean mind that was wrapped up in the, on the Hellenistic side with the Greek,

22:31.560 --> 22:35.880
things are coming from their verbs. I want you to just take a look at this verb.

22:36.680 --> 22:48.440
It is the base for child and it means to dance or play or play amorously. Wow. When you have the

22:48.440 --> 22:59.880
word paideia in Greek, it is understood that there is a relationship between the teacher

22:59.880 --> 23:09.720
and the teacher. And it has to do with touching and it has to do with the maturation of the bud,

23:10.920 --> 23:15.960
right? You want to bring that bud to perfection. That's what they looked at

23:16.680 --> 23:24.920
as purification, as education, excuse me, as education, as paideia. That's why they call

23:25.800 --> 23:35.880
the horsemen who are hung the teachers of the princes. That's why they call them

23:36.760 --> 23:48.120
pedarasts. That's a Greek word for that teacher, the pedarast. When Jesus is calling for paideia,

23:48.120 --> 23:58.440
he is calling for victims of pedarasty. And we know that the, at least his attitude reflects this,

23:58.440 --> 24:04.120
because when he gets called short on it, he says, you're going to end up scandalizing me,

24:05.080 --> 24:10.360
right? Right? So for those of you who have the little Jesus blessed me and whatnot,

24:10.360 --> 24:17.880
realize there's a tradition of directly touching children, of molesting children

24:17.880 --> 24:26.360
associated with the rites and the mystery, okay? Neil, you know. Not a controversial statement.

24:26.360 --> 24:32.760
Any classes this will say, yeah, this is part of the Greek world. This was normalized in the

24:32.760 --> 24:37.480
Greek. I'm not saying I think we should bring it back or anything. I'm just saying that's the

24:37.480 --> 24:41.960
reality of the fact. The Greeks were, you know what I'm saying? It's just the reality of it.

24:43.640 --> 24:51.560
Actually, in fact, somewhere over here, I have a book titled Paralytes. And this scholar put

24:51.560 --> 25:05.000
together like tons of texts of ancient Greek that are very, very graphic, sexual. And nine times out

25:05.000 --> 25:12.760
of 10, it's an older male with a prepubescent boy. Nine times out of 10. That's what these texts are

25:13.720 --> 25:23.400
portraying. We've got gods who have boys that pour their nectar. And we have gods

25:23.400 --> 25:34.040
who are great mothers who bring their boys to maturation. These are essential to the mystery

25:34.040 --> 25:40.520
rites. Both of the ones I just mentioned to you. Heracles performs mystery rites. The temples to

25:40.520 --> 25:47.640
Heracles are temples where mystery rites are performed. Yes, fantastic. What about you thought

25:47.640 --> 25:54.520
it was all athletics, right? So these are the same thing. They're doing the same things. When

25:54.520 --> 25:59.160
you have the great mother and she's important, the great mother entering this whole equation,

26:01.560 --> 26:10.200
you take that young boy Addis and you bring him into a point of burning off all of his

26:10.200 --> 26:19.080
mortality, right? It's a process. And this idolatrous process involves a lot of drugs.

26:19.720 --> 26:24.040
And I think, Neil, that's one of the areas that people, we can look at texts like this.

26:24.600 --> 26:28.200
And we can say, oh my goodness, Jesus was a downright

26:30.120 --> 26:37.480
magus. He was right in this, right in this magus tradition. Neil, why did, why did these magi

26:37.480 --> 26:47.400
show up? I didn't say the three. These magi, why did they show up and say, brah, your child right

26:47.400 --> 26:54.200
here, the one that was just born, we've been following his esterian. Yeah. And what we're

26:54.200 --> 27:01.960
going to do is he's going to be the one who bears the, is that vessel that's straight up mystery,

27:02.040 --> 27:08.760
that Christos, that's straight up mystery. There's a group of dudes imposing this upon him

27:08.760 --> 27:15.960
from the beginning and giving him drugs. Jesus had drugs from the start. You cannot make these

27:15.960 --> 27:21.400
drugs without the two bases that they gave him. They gave him frankincense and myrrh.

27:21.400 --> 27:26.600
They gave him frankincense and myrrh and your preachers can preach all day. Anyone that knows

27:26.600 --> 27:36.680
the orphic tradition, if you have a copy of the orphic hymns, those two oils are burnt in offering

27:36.680 --> 27:42.600
to these pagan deities. You offer frankincense and then you do a hymn to Nyx, the goddess,

27:43.160 --> 27:50.600
or a hymn to Hercules or something. Those are the two main oils that are burned in the orphic

27:50.600 --> 28:00.040
fragments. That's what you're offering up before you take your incense and you offer it up to induce

28:00.040 --> 28:05.720
because we know within the mystery, this is pretty cool. We know from later sources through the

28:05.720 --> 28:16.200
Neopathagoreans that daemonace, demons function by smell. So the first Christian anti-drug laws

28:16.200 --> 28:24.440
are specifically against drugs that are used to promote this process, to either drive away the

28:24.440 --> 28:31.240
demons or to collect them. What are the pagans going to do? What can they do? Look at this.

28:31.240 --> 28:37.160
I just flipped through a random page in the orphic hymns of Orpheus. Flip through a random page.

28:37.720 --> 28:43.480
First thing it says, to Vulcan, offer fumigation of frankincense and manna.

28:47.400 --> 28:52.360
I'm adding to what you just said. The point is, when you offered these frankincense and you lit it

28:52.360 --> 28:57.960
up and the oil would burn, you're literally, the gods are smelling this and they would come

28:57.960 --> 29:04.200
and they would listen to your hymn. That's how you contact with the gods in the Greek world.

29:04.200 --> 29:11.400
No different in Christianity. Think of it this way. There's a place that you can go and you can buy

29:11.400 --> 29:22.200
this smirna and this a woman puts on and in her vagina and it's a compound drug and what does it

29:22.200 --> 29:33.080
smell like? It smells exactly like where it is. It is a place of bringing forward from death life.

29:33.640 --> 29:43.720
It is a funk that they use in Ritu, in Rite, that involves the orgasmos, right?

29:44.360 --> 29:50.760
So yeah, all of this stuff is, this is, I keep trying to convince people, Neil, that the pharmacy

29:50.760 --> 29:57.800
and antiquity as we look at it, we're looking very, very two-dimensionally. When you blow it up

29:57.800 --> 30:02.520
and look at it and say, look, they, they have this idea that comes from the Bronze Age,

30:02.520 --> 30:08.200
that you can take a person and you can put them under the influence of certain drugs,

30:08.200 --> 30:18.280
including venoms, you know, bee stings, spider, scorpion stings, all of these different venoms

30:18.280 --> 30:24.280
that they're using. You can take a person and put them under that influence, right, and kick them

30:24.280 --> 30:32.840
into a place called the Eremon, right, into the desert, where they will be forced to deal with

30:33.640 --> 30:42.440
Lucifer, right, where they will be forced in that place. That kingdom is his kingdom. So yeah.

30:43.640 --> 30:46.600
You mentioned, hold on a second, this is really deep, what you just said.

30:47.560 --> 30:55.960
You mentioned the Magi tradition. In the, in the Zendivesta, which is a text that predates the

30:55.960 --> 31:05.400
Gospels by a long centuries, very much, very old. There's a text where Zoroaster is in the desert

31:06.520 --> 31:14.600
and he's roaming the desert and he's rushed by Anger Manu. And Anger Manu says, if you will

31:14.600 --> 31:21.240
renounce the good God, Ahura Mazda, I'll give you the boons to rule all the nations.

31:22.280 --> 31:28.200
And then Ahura Mazda, or then Zoroaster just starts chanting and then he makes Anger Manu leave.

31:28.760 --> 31:34.760
Well, this is what you see in the Gospels, with Jesus in the desert being tempted by the devil,

31:34.760 --> 31:39.320
who says, if you worship me, I'll give you all, I'll give you all the kingdoms of the world.

31:39.880 --> 31:42.920
Exactly. This is coming from that tradition that you're talking about.

31:42.920 --> 31:48.440
You see how it's part of the mystery and how it fits in and you see, oh, this is why they're doing

31:48.440 --> 31:54.440
what they're doing. It's our Magi that, that, that recite these texts. There's a lot of drugs.

31:54.440 --> 32:03.960
There's a lot of drugs and there are drug texts. I was reading one last month about this bites of

32:04.040 --> 32:11.960
spiders and what to do and how to treat and what groups are using these types of drugs.

32:13.160 --> 32:20.520
And the, the pharmacy is complex. It's really complex, but they are taking the human body

32:20.520 --> 32:29.560
and they are turning it into a means of giving drugs to other people. So this whole thing about

32:29.560 --> 32:34.520
people are shocked when they're like, what? I'm like, look, if you were in an ancient riot,

32:34.520 --> 32:40.120
they're going to drug you beforehand. They're going to tie your hands behind your back,

32:40.120 --> 32:48.120
restrain your ankles. They're going to sodomize you with a, a, an alabaster. It's a device.

32:48.120 --> 32:54.520
By the way, that's also in Mark 14. Yes. Same chapter, same chapter that we're discussing

32:54.600 --> 33:00.520
with the little boy. This chapter opens up with the alabaster, which is another mystery,

33:00.520 --> 33:05.400
mystery religion term that you see thrown around there. And if you see how people translate,

33:05.400 --> 33:11.160
it's always hilarious, right? I mean, they don't even make sense rationally. He busted the jar and

33:11.160 --> 33:15.560
it was, that's how you do it. You break. No. And they're all mad. Remember the other things.

33:15.560 --> 33:23.560
Remember, they're all mad because it was very expensive, right? What do you think that very

33:23.560 --> 33:30.200
expensive stuff is for? That's the stuff that the initiates are using. That's the, that's the

33:30.200 --> 33:35.480
hardcore. People aren't realized, but they have so many drugs in the ancient world. So many.

33:35.480 --> 33:41.640
You can't even talk about arrows without talking the arrow poison that they're using in different

33:41.640 --> 33:46.440
parts of the world. They're also getting high off it, but they're taking a person's body

33:47.080 --> 33:52.840
and they're turning that person's body into the producer of the blood,

33:53.880 --> 34:01.720
the hyma, which can also be ejaculate. Okay. So when Jesus' face is covered with that sticky stuff,

34:01.720 --> 34:08.360
and it says it was his hedros, that it was his, originally it looks like sweat and it turns into

34:08.360 --> 34:14.520
what looks like hyma. You know, that hyma is used especially in cold contexts

34:15.320 --> 34:24.440
to the essence substance. You get the hyma, Zeus gets the hyma when he sucks the penis of

34:25.560 --> 34:32.280
the invisible one. Doesn't this happen to Priapis too? Yeah.

34:32.760 --> 34:40.760
Mm-hmm. And if you get that, yeah, no, he is that fanase. Yeah, fanase is that Priapis,

34:40.760 --> 34:45.160
the invisible one is that Priapis, right? I mean, you said you were going to the wilderness.

34:45.160 --> 34:50.040
You wanted to go, right? You took the drug, so they've got you and they've got you bound and

34:50.040 --> 34:57.160
they've got you giving it to them. And by the way, the guy who's writing our letter,

34:57.240 --> 35:04.680
whether it's Udo Clement or whatever, whoever is writing that letter says there are these dudes

35:05.640 --> 35:12.520
who are doing things very good, who are doing things that are not, they're following the way of

35:12.520 --> 35:19.480
Satan into the darkness, he says right here. Those carpocratians, too. Yeah, those carpocratians,

35:19.480 --> 35:25.160
and what are they doing? They're doing unspeakable things with the flesh.

35:25.800 --> 35:33.240
Deep things. And with, yeah. Puffed up with gnosis. It actually says puffed up gnosis.

35:34.600 --> 35:39.960
This is so crazy, man. We're going deep right now. I'm loving this.

35:41.080 --> 35:47.400
And Neil, you're so, you're even closer than you think with that puffed up because that's the

35:47.400 --> 35:55.960
word for being, for bringing us its Pephocilmino on page on line five there, two, three, four, five.

35:55.960 --> 36:04.280
Yeah. It's also used for snakes, making the noise of a hissing. Yeah. There might be a little bit

36:04.280 --> 36:11.000
of terminology that's sneaking in here. These may be a specific group of people. For example,

36:11.560 --> 36:19.560
they call the ioboloi ehidnon. Those are the poison throwers of the echidna, or the vipers.

36:20.120 --> 36:27.000
The vipers are a group, a college of priestesses, and the ioboloi are the ones who pour the poison.

36:27.880 --> 36:35.240
And by the way, these carpocratians are deriving their theology from biblical texts. They're not,

36:35.960 --> 36:43.000
like, they get called heretics later on and in this text. But they're looking at Jesus as the

36:43.000 --> 36:52.520
serpent in the desert that Moses held up. And John says, just as Moses held up a serpent in the desert,

36:52.520 --> 36:56.440
so too shall the Son of Man be lifted up. The carpocratians, that's central to them.

36:57.720 --> 37:02.440
They call themselves, they call them the ophites, the nascines. They're all snake,

37:02.440 --> 37:10.520
nas means serpent in Hebrew. Ophite, serpent. These are, these nostics are getting their theology,

37:10.520 --> 37:13.800
not just from making stuff up. They're getting it from the Bible.

37:14.280 --> 37:23.400
Right. Right. And he is accused of being a mystic god in that process. The thing that I like about

37:23.400 --> 37:30.360
the church as a classical philologist, I can completely ignore them. I can completely ignore

37:30.360 --> 37:36.600
them. You can hit me with antinomy in this and this interpretation of that. It's all bullshit

37:36.600 --> 37:43.000
because of the time, at the time that we have these documents that are talking about this cult

37:43.000 --> 37:49.160
activity with Jesus, there are none of these people. They don't exist. Right. So if we go back

37:49.160 --> 37:55.720
to that original context with your brain, the, the ophites, for example, yeah, the orphics,

37:55.720 --> 38:03.480
that was the snake in the breast. That was their symbol. Right. Yeah. That was a snake in the breast.

38:04.040 --> 38:10.680
So, and he says, the author of this letter says, Hey, um, you know that they're doing these things

38:10.680 --> 38:17.000
and these awful things and we cannot, we cannot, uh, get involved. And he's like, even if he's

38:17.000 --> 38:24.040
saying true stuff, you have to deny. Right. So there's probably, there might be a Christian

38:24.040 --> 38:30.120
watching right now who's saying, Orphics, that's pagan. That has nothing to do with Christianity.

38:30.120 --> 38:37.480
We'll check this out. Pseudopigrafa. This is all Bible. This is all Pseudopigrafa Bible text.

38:37.480 --> 38:44.760
There's a whole section just dedicated to the Orphics. In fact, it goes even deeper than that.

38:44.760 --> 38:51.560
The Orphics that were living in Alexandria, where are you going over who came first? Moses

38:51.560 --> 38:59.560
or Orpheus? And then they, if you point to the text of Plato, Plato says, Mousseus is the son of Orpheus.

39:00.440 --> 39:06.680
And so they're trying to wrestle with this idea that Moses can't be subservient to Orpheus. It's

39:06.680 --> 39:12.680
got to be the other way around. And you see this back and forth happening in the first century,

39:12.680 --> 39:18.920
where people are trying to claim Orpheus as their prophet. But we know the real Orpheus,

39:18.920 --> 39:24.840
we know it really, Orpheus was a Dionysian high priest. He was the high priest of Bacchus

39:25.400 --> 39:31.640
and the son of Apollo. He was connected, baby. Orpheus is the real deal. He's the poet. He's

39:31.640 --> 39:39.880
the bard. He's the prophet telling the future. So you can't get these monotheists in the first

39:39.880 --> 39:46.120
century are trying to claim him as one of their own. They're known. You can't do it down. This

39:46.120 --> 39:53.320
is Bacchic. This is Pythagorean. This is, you know what I mean? This is, that's the real source.

39:54.440 --> 39:59.880
Celsus is so gene. This is why I love Celsus. He's so brilliantly calls out the Christians.

39:59.880 --> 40:06.040
You guys are just a degradation of the real thing. Just a degradation. He's like the real deal comes

40:06.040 --> 40:12.920
out of Egypt. And the Christians are, they're Sybilist. But they're a degradation of the Sybilist.

40:12.920 --> 40:18.040
And the Sybilist, the Sybilist religion is the religion of Rome. The Sybilian books. If you,

40:18.040 --> 40:23.720
if you look at the history of the Sybilian books, the Sybilian books is what guides Rome and all

40:23.720 --> 40:29.720
these wars against Carthaginians, against the Greeks, against whoever. The Sybilian books tells

40:29.720 --> 40:35.400
them what to do. Go and import Magna Mater from Phrygia. Bring her into the temple. If you do this,

40:35.400 --> 40:39.560
you'll win the war. And they're doing it. And it's all documented throughout history.

40:40.280 --> 40:46.120
Third century, second century BCE, you see the Romans following these Sybilian books. And then

40:46.120 --> 40:50.520
all of a sudden, third, second century, third century, the common era, all of a sudden, these

40:50.520 --> 40:54.520
Sybilian books are just Christian now. They're not pagan anymore. They become Christianized.

40:55.240 --> 41:02.040
So you see that this tradition, as Celsus points out, is a degradation of the original

41:03.000 --> 41:05.880
pagan rites, these mystery rites.

41:10.280 --> 41:12.040
Can I say, can I get an N?

41:15.160 --> 41:19.160
Yeah.

41:20.360 --> 41:23.400
Yeah, I fell out of there. Sorry about that. Am I back?

41:23.400 --> 41:25.000
Yeah, you're, Ben, you're good.

41:25.000 --> 41:35.560
Okay. It just my, you know, I was just wanting to say amen. Amen. Amen. And that locks it in.

41:35.560 --> 41:43.320
I am the amen. I am the amen all over the world. There are Christians and they're

41:43.320 --> 41:51.640
thanking the Lord Jesus Christ for their food. And they're saying in Jesus Christ's name, I pray, amen.

41:52.600 --> 42:02.840
Don't realize that they are borrowing a pagan magic ritual in the pronunciation of that name.

42:03.640 --> 42:11.640
That when they say amen, they are induced, they are introducing a Satanian or what I would call

42:11.640 --> 42:21.400
Satanic magical device. When Jesus says the kingdom of Uranus, now you know why he talks

42:21.400 --> 42:28.280
about the fire coming from Uranus because it's a pagan. Those are your mystery terms.

42:28.840 --> 42:35.400
Those are your mystery terms. Jesus is not making up new stuff. For those of you out there who are

42:36.360 --> 42:43.640
following the fairy tale of modern Christianity, be it Catholic or Protestant,

42:44.840 --> 42:54.920
surprise, surprise. This is not a fairy tale and Jesus is there using the mystery in his own

42:54.920 --> 43:01.320
direction. When he sits on the cross and he's yelling out, I'm thirsty. I'm thirsty. I'm thirsty.

43:01.320 --> 43:08.920
Guess what? The physicians say this is what happens when you use the horned North African

43:08.920 --> 43:16.520
viper venom. This is what you get. That's why they called it the dipsauce because it creates this

43:16.520 --> 43:24.040
intense thirst. Not only is Jesus arrested with a naked boy, but he is on drugs and he's on mystery

43:24.040 --> 43:33.800
drugs that we have reams of antidote in ancient Greek and Latin. We have reams of antidotes for

43:33.800 --> 43:41.400
these things. The down and dirty picture of Jesus. Neil, do you think he's like the

43:42.040 --> 43:47.240
Baptists who are out with their penis-shaped cups and their boys that they take out and

43:47.240 --> 43:56.760
baptize? Do you think that's the group he's in? He's got his racket set up where he's got his

43:56.760 --> 44:04.360
naked children, right? I want to go back to something you just mentioned because the oldest

44:04.360 --> 44:11.560
source of the story of Moses that we have goes back to an Alexandrian priest in the fourth century

44:12.280 --> 44:22.040
during one of the Ptolemy's reigns. He writes this story about Moses.

44:24.280 --> 44:29.560
Supposedly, it's right before the Septuagint gets written. We had this story about this. The guy who

44:29.560 --> 44:38.840
writes this story is an Egyptian pagan. He, in some of his texts, and I'm Corey's ancient fragments,

44:38.840 --> 44:43.800
this is the text that I'm citing here, where he shows this guy is using this term,

44:43.800 --> 44:50.920
hallelujah, amen, in some of his writings. Plutarch, in the first century, the second

44:50.920 --> 44:58.200
century, the common era, he comments on this, on this exact person, and he says that he cites this

44:58.200 --> 45:05.720
person. What's his name? Hang on, let me find his name. But anyways, while I'm finding his name,

45:05.720 --> 45:12.680
this is what he says about him. He says that the word Amon, the god Amon, is the king of all the

45:12.680 --> 45:22.440
gods of Egypt. He says that when Egyptians call on or call to any of the gods, not just Amon,

45:23.160 --> 45:32.280
any of the gods, when they finish their prayers or when they're calling out to one another,

45:33.080 --> 45:43.080
they use the term Amon. And we know that ancient Egyptian and ancient Hebrew, there is no vowels,

45:44.680 --> 45:51.320
amen. So, some people, I'm one of them that this has been decided on by, a lot of scholars will

45:51.320 --> 45:55.960
say that I'm going on fringe territory now. I don't care because I haven't heard any

45:55.960 --> 46:01.240
better explanation of where that term comes from, better than what Plutarch says. It's in the

46:01.320 --> 46:07.480
text, I'm Isis and Osiris, where he says that word Amon is the word that's used to

46:09.080 --> 46:15.480
enchant and to call on any of the gods. So, I'm thinking that's your source right there.

46:19.560 --> 46:29.800
So, when Jesus says, I am the amen, you can hear that he is deep in this thing. It's no wonder that

46:29.800 --> 46:37.080
he would want to be called the Christ and what the Christ was because that is the one within

46:37.880 --> 46:45.320
the right who is performing that mystery transformation, right? Oh my god, it's wonderful.

46:45.320 --> 46:52.440
Drink of my blood, right? Love it. You know, they were doing that, right? So, it's not like

46:53.240 --> 46:58.920
it's not like it's out of place. Beautiful. Yeah. Who's your amen?

47:00.680 --> 47:09.880
Right, that term, amen. Yeah. It's fascinating though because I've only seen a few academics that

47:09.880 --> 47:15.880
actually engage with this verse that Plutarch and I'm talking about from Isis and Osiris.

47:16.760 --> 47:22.680
And the person that he cites is the person who writes the story about Moses,

47:23.560 --> 47:29.720
pre-Bible. Like before the Septuagint is put together, this guy's writing stories about Moses

47:30.680 --> 47:35.480
and it turns out that he's the guy who cites for this amen thing. So, I don't know. I don't know.

47:35.480 --> 47:39.480
What do you guys think? And I'm interested to hear what people think about that.

47:39.480 --> 47:49.880
We also have Olo Luzo. The verb in Greek, Olo Luzo, means to cry out in ecstasy. It can be,

47:49.880 --> 47:56.200
it's usually like a... Oh, Hecateus. Sorry to cut you off. Hecateus of Abdera. I couldn't think of

47:56.200 --> 48:01.560
the name but I found it now. Hecateus of Abdera. And going back, we're going back to ancient Egypt,

48:01.560 --> 48:07.640
you know? Do you know how much it turns me on to have you quote Hecateus of Abdera?

48:07.720 --> 48:13.800
That gives me hope for the world. I thought we were here to destroy it. You and I as two witnesses.

48:13.800 --> 48:22.680
But that gives me hope, brah. And if anybody ever has anything bad about you, they can suck it

48:22.680 --> 48:27.720
because you serve the muse, man. You bring back Hecateus. You're good. I love it.

48:27.720 --> 48:33.480
You want to hear it? I got the passage from Plutarch right now. Plutarch says,

48:34.040 --> 48:41.640
Moreover, the people believe that Amun is the name given to Zeus in the land of the Egyptians.

48:42.360 --> 48:51.160
A name which we, with a slight alteration, hold on, you got to pause right there. Amun

48:51.960 --> 48:57.880
with a slight alteration. He doesn't say what it is. It could be Amen. It could be Amzin.

48:57.960 --> 49:00.680
He says slight alteration. Okay, remember that.

49:02.680 --> 49:12.040
Pronounce Amun. But Menatho of Sabentus thinks that the meaning concealed or concealment

49:12.040 --> 49:18.920
lies in the word. Hecateus of Abdera says the Egyptians use this expression, remember,

49:18.920 --> 49:25.240
the altered form of Amun. So it's not Amun. It's an altered form of Amun. Like, come on,

49:25.240 --> 49:30.360
dude, we have a slam dunk right here. I mean, let me finish this off. Egyptians express that

49:30.360 --> 49:38.120
whenever they call to anyone for the word is a form of address, when they therefore

49:39.160 --> 49:46.840
address the supreme God whom they believe to be the same as the universe as if he were invisible

49:46.840 --> 49:54.920
and concealed and implore him to make himself visible and manifest, they use the alteration of

49:54.920 --> 50:04.120
Amun. So great then was the circumspection of the Egyptians in their wisdom, touching that he has

50:04.120 --> 50:11.000
to do with all the gods. And I've showed this to a couple of different academics and some of them

50:11.000 --> 50:16.760
are like, wow, that's interesting. I think you're on to something. But I've never, it's just nobody,

50:16.760 --> 50:24.040
it's like, that's it. It just ends there. Nobody's, everybody said, what does Amen mean? Oh, so,

50:24.040 --> 50:29.800
it means so be it. It means so be it. According to who? Because that's, that's a later rendition.

50:31.800 --> 50:38.280
Show me an ancient source before the Septuagint or before Christianity, where someone says that Amen

50:38.280 --> 50:44.200
means so be it. What is your opinion now? You don't hear that until later. What's your opinion of

50:44.200 --> 50:48.840
modern scholars? You've been interviewing them a bunch and you've had a whole, how about everything

50:48.920 --> 50:56.600
from Harvard to, to whatever all over the place? What is your opinion? I don't want to come off as like,

50:56.600 --> 51:03.960
some cocky amateur in my, in my house that's not these, these are I have respect for scholars,

51:03.960 --> 51:07.880
because they put in the work and they are trained. But sometimes they're like this,

51:08.520 --> 51:13.560
they only are looking at the thing that they're trained in. And they don't realize that some of

51:13.560 --> 51:18.360
their stuff is overlapping. And some of these stuff, some of these scholars are overlapping with them.

51:18.360 --> 51:22.200
And some of these scholars are, and they can't see it. That's why me and Derek try to bring

51:22.200 --> 51:26.600
these scholars on together. Hey, look, you're looking at this. Hey, you're looking at this.

51:26.600 --> 51:31.480
Look, here's two different pieces to a bigger puzzle. Not saying that I, not saying that I

51:31.480 --> 51:35.480
know everything. And I'm not saying that at all. But I'm saying, I'm just saying my experience

51:35.480 --> 51:40.760
was sometimes they can be like that. But I have respect for scholars. I love, they're, they're,

51:40.760 --> 51:46.200
they're, they're brilliant people. Oh, of course, of course. But yeah, and I, that's what I'm,

51:46.200 --> 51:51.000
that's all I'm getting at. I don't, if I can say it just for your audience.

51:53.240 --> 51:59.640
I don't have any respect for scholars, especially the ones from the Ivy League,

51:59.640 --> 52:05.960
especially the ones from the Ivy League. And it's not just me that thanks it. I have friends who

52:05.960 --> 52:10.920
are professors. Well, you were a professor. You feel the same way. Yeah. And that's where I learned

52:11.080 --> 52:16.440
as being a professor in going to international meetings. It's hilarious now. I went to,

52:16.440 --> 52:23.160
I went to an international meeting in London and the London, I think we got bust up the Newcastle.

52:23.160 --> 52:28.040
I can't remember where the actual meeting was, but the London Times came and of everybody's,

52:28.040 --> 52:33.800
they, they watched and came to mind and said, this is the last frontier of classics,

52:33.800 --> 52:40.040
because I was talking about drugs and I was talking about the pharmacological side. And

52:40.680 --> 52:46.120
I fought for years against these classicists. Look, look at these texts. Somebody just opened

52:46.120 --> 52:53.560
this text. You know, classicists mostly refuse to go to the New Testament. I don't know if you've

52:53.560 --> 52:59.320
noticed it, but you, you're a religious studies scholars and whatnot. They're not classical

52:59.320 --> 53:05.480
philologists. No. Classical philologists do not like to mess with the New Testament,

53:05.480 --> 53:10.920
because they know, oh, there's a whole another group here who thinks they own the water, right?

53:10.920 --> 53:16.200
It's like contested water. And if you go over there, China's going to shoot you with a missile or

53:16.200 --> 53:23.000
something, right? So don't go over there. But yeah, Neil, if you can get these people to start

53:23.000 --> 53:29.240
looking at it, like I would love to ask, why, why does nobody talk about the naked boy? I would

53:29.240 --> 53:37.000
love to see you get with somebody from Harvard. You know, you just ask them straight out, a naked boy

53:37.720 --> 53:42.840
seriously. Well, this is the thing. This is what, this is the thing about this. The God, everyone

53:42.840 --> 53:49.320
agrees that the gospel of Mark is written where there's no, there's no extra fat. It's the shortest

53:49.320 --> 53:54.360
of the gospels. It gets straight to the point. There is no extra biblical, there's no extra.

53:55.320 --> 54:01.240
And they, it was five, like there's no extra information. Everything that Mark says has

54:01.240 --> 54:09.080
some reason why it's there. Every, every syllable is there for a reason. So the fact that a little

54:09.080 --> 54:13.640
boy runs away naked is not just like, I would just ignore that part. Just an extra information. No,

54:13.640 --> 54:18.360
no, no, no, no, no, no. Mark is saying something here. We need to stop and look at it. What is

54:18.440 --> 54:24.520
Mark trying to say? Not only that, not only that, Neil, I think that's a brilliant point, like something

54:24.520 --> 54:29.880
that I would expect to, you know, that's what a scholar, you're doing what a scholar would do.

54:29.880 --> 54:36.040
They're not doing their job. So you're doing it. You're exactly right about the concision of Mark.

54:36.680 --> 54:42.200
I would take it even further and say, you've got more evidence because there is a much greater

54:42.200 --> 54:48.840
concentration of Orphic mystery terminology in Mark than there is anywhere else. Almost

54:48.840 --> 54:56.120
like you can take those areas that have that radiation, that Orphic radiation, and you can see

54:56.120 --> 55:03.160
that other authors were saying, oh, we have to include this, but I'm going to blow it up into

55:03.160 --> 55:09.800
something else. Right. You can, if you take a purple pen and you outline everything in the

55:09.800 --> 55:17.480
Gospels that has to do with the mystery performance, you're going to see what's left over is the

55:17.480 --> 55:24.680
garbage. Right. It's the, you can see consistently, if there's one thing we can say about Jesus,

55:24.680 --> 55:33.240
just from an evidentiary standpoint, is the dude was way deep in a cult and he was way deep in a

55:33.240 --> 55:41.720
mainstream death and resurrection mystery cult involving drugs and sex. Okay. If there's one

55:41.720 --> 55:49.080
thing we can say from all of those purple markers, right, it's that. And I don't know,

55:49.080 --> 55:54.120
do you ever get the sense that your guys in religious studies don't want to look at Jesus,

55:54.120 --> 56:01.240
the Magus? Well, you know, I, so this is something that I've discussed with a lot of people is that

56:02.200 --> 56:06.840
in religious studies in particular, just in religious studies, not in classicists and not

56:07.400 --> 56:13.000
in, and not in full up, a lot of people, a lot of American biblical studies is

56:13.720 --> 56:20.840
steered by the seminaries, by the churches, by the evangelical, the THD people,

56:20.840 --> 56:27.640
not the THD, the THD people, the theology degree people. They're guiding the ship of biblical

56:28.040 --> 56:32.920
in a lot of ways they are. I'm not saying that they had all the control, I'm not saying that it's

56:32.920 --> 56:38.840
some, there's like a conspiracy to, you know, keep Christianity afloat. But I will say that there is

56:38.840 --> 56:46.440
a lot of influencing by people with an agenda. And it's my personal opinion, feel free to disagree

56:46.440 --> 56:52.200
in the comments. But that's how I see it right now. Do you think they've, this is something new,

56:52.200 --> 56:58.760
or you think they've been doing this kind of crap for the last, I don't know, maybe 1600 years or

56:58.760 --> 57:04.600
somewhere, somewhere around the times that Julian, the emperor, whom we both love, right? Neil's a

57:04.600 --> 57:11.720
huge Julian fan, right? So am I. When that Christian soldier threw that spear into his back, fighting

57:11.720 --> 57:17.560
over there with the Parthians. That was the, you were telling me just the other day about the

57:18.360 --> 57:23.240
video about Julian. And I got to that part in his story. I had to take a stop and take a right,

57:23.240 --> 57:31.480
like this changed history for the worst in my opinion. Because Julian was trying to bring back

57:31.480 --> 57:37.880
that metropolitan Roman world where every city has their own God and every, everyone has the

57:37.880 --> 57:43.560
right to worship their own God in their own way. And why did it take another 1500 years to get back

57:43.560 --> 57:50.680
to that? And by the way, out of all people to rebuild and bring the Jews back to Jerusalem,

57:50.680 --> 57:57.160
to where their temple is, he's the one that was going to do it. Julian was the last person that

57:57.160 --> 58:03.960
said Jerusalem belongs to the Jews. And all the way up to 1948, no one did that, no Christian

58:03.960 --> 58:09.240
emperor, no Christian emperor ever wanted to give Jerusalem back to the Jews. They wanted it for

58:09.240 --> 58:17.800
themselves. But Julian was someone who understood that religion is personal. And so he's a hero,

58:17.800 --> 58:24.920
in my opinion. We really lost a lot when Julian was taken down. Do you think that has anything to

58:24.920 --> 58:32.040
do with the whole idea that they found Bacchic implements inside the temple and that temple

58:32.040 --> 58:38.120
practice had become a, you know, there's a reason Plutarch, the priest of Apollo says

58:38.120 --> 58:43.960
Judaism is Bacchic worship. And then he starts to talk about it in table talk, right? Then we lose

58:43.960 --> 58:50.440
the rest of the document. As soon as he gets past the explains the pomegranates, he explains,

58:50.440 --> 58:55.720
starts explaining the temple and what the priests are wearing and how it's all Bacchic.

58:55.960 --> 59:02.520
You know what I think? We're talking about these academics who, they'll read this

59:02.520 --> 59:09.720
passages by Tacitus and this is nonsense. But I think Tacitus is down to something

59:09.720 --> 59:19.560
because you have this God Sabatios. Sabatios is identified as a form of Bacchus. But some

59:19.560 --> 59:23.800
people have pointed out that Sabatios might be related to, he's the god of the Sabbath.

59:24.760 --> 59:30.600
So you had this Sabbath God, who's like Bacchus, but a little bit more different, a little more,

59:31.160 --> 59:35.800
you know, a little more institutional. And there's, there's, it's quite possible

59:36.600 --> 59:43.320
that Yahweh has some links to Sabatios. It's a Phrygian father God. You know, he's like a Zeus.

59:43.320 --> 59:50.600
He's like a Saturn. He's like Yahweh. Yahweh, Yahweh of the Sabbath might be the Sabatios.

59:50.600 --> 59:53.240
There might be some connection there. That's all I'm saying.

59:53.240 --> 59:57.720
Aren't they always trying to run out people? They're like, pull down that temple where all the

59:57.720 --> 01:00:03.320
sex stuff goes on and stuff like that. And they're trying to change. I don't understand.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:09.640
It seems like that's the inner mysteries are when, when you get deeper into any religion,

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:14.760
the inner mysteries is always something like some phallus or something. Some in the middle of a

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:21.240
temple or the Holy of Holies is supposed to be, there's the phallus, you know, the, the, the sacred.

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:28.120
There's a reason, you know, there's a reason we need the virgin, right? And all of the, all of the

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:34.840
imagery around the, the virgin mother, people think the virgin mother started with Mary. It doesn't.

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:44.040
It doesn't, right? Neither does her power to carry the purple. The, the nurse that stuck her

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:51.480
fingers into Mary's vagina on the Coptic side pulls out the burning purple. It burns her hands,

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:59.640
right? There's some transfer, you know, you were talking about symbols and you were talking about

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:07.720
Rome and how important Rome is that Roman mystery is the foundation. That's why you look at the

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:15.400
apocalypse and you see Rome, right? The, the, the seven hills are there for a reason. It's because

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:23.480
they developed the mystery and Numa is taking it from this girl named Egeria, who apparently lives

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:31.080
for a thousand years, but looks like she's a teenager the whole time. And he takes those books

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:38.440
and he buries them, right? When he dies, he's like, she told me everything. The future of the city of

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:43.320
Rome, what would happen? And it was huts, you know, I mean, it was nothing, well, it was more than

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:50.360
huts, but, um, and they buried those books, right? And on his instructions as death, they dug them

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:55.720
up years later, took them to the Senate and the Senate was like, Oh my God, we have to get rid of

01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:02.600
these things. So when the Christians come along and they're calling them civilists,

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:09.160
you know, it's, those traditions are not, there's a, there's a reason for Peter and Rome,

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:16.600
right? And it's a mystic reason. It's a mystic reason that goes right back to Jesus getting

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:25.560
arrested with that kid. It's not odd. Heracles has one, right? God himself has one. He's

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:29.720
got his boy. You know, they talk about in that dirty poetry that you were talking about,

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:36.280
they talk about what it is to pull a Ganymede. That means to drink out of a boy's anus.

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:43.160
The nectar. Yeah. I read that. I saw that go from straight toe. And this is like, these were like

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:49.400
popular porn, basically. It's like the ancient version of porn. And that's what they were,

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:54.920
and that's the imagery is like Zeus and Ganymede and Apollo and Hayekinth. And

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:59.800
there's a lot of that going on. And it's just, that's the, this is what we, this is the context

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:04.680
that I think should be mandatory for people to realize before they even look at these texts.

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:10.840
Yeah. Look what you've done too. Your audience should appreciate the fact that you have not

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:17.560
had the benefit of Harvard education, yet you are able to swim those currents and access that

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:24.760
information. And now you're, you're, you're going beyond where they're capable of going.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:35.320
And that's, you know, that's amazing. I would have you in, as my trench warrior anytime, anytime.

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:41.640
The sources don't lie. Yeah. And here's the thing, even if the sources are wrong,

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:47.400
even when Herodotus tells a story that might not be true, there's something that story tells

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:53.080
us something about the time. Right. So when Herodotus is saying that there's one eyed men

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:57.480
in gold guarding griffins living in the North where the hyperboreans are, that might not be a

01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:03.320
true statement, but it tells us of how the Greeks thought of the Scythians. They thought of a magical

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:09.640
fairy land up there and it was dark and there's forests were scary and there was monsters creeping

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:15.400
out. That's how the Greeks thought of the, the North. Herodotus captures that. That's why I'm

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:20.440
saying even the primary sources, even if they're not true, they're, they tell us more about the

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:27.720
context of the time than any modern theory can tell us. There's a, there's a dragon that guards a

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:35.320
tree. Everybody knows about him. It's in the grove of Mars and on the tree hangs a skin,

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:43.960
right, of a ram and on it is written the sacred song. Right. That's the cibulations. They're

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:51.720
all captured there and that dude walks around. He's blind. First of all, but he walks around

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:58.200
with poison that he can spit. He can use on arrows. He can do whatever he wants. And if you get near

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:04.760
it, he'll kill you immediately. The Greeks couldn't conquer. They went to, they went to Troy with all

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:09.720
their big fights and we know about Bronze Age combat. We can put the limny and steel up here,

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:15.800
you know, harkening back to the Bronze Age with the combat. Yeah, but what's really, what's really

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:23.800
courageous? What's really courageous? It's Odysseus with his arrow poison. Having Cersei put him into

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:30.600
a death state and you didn't know that. You're like, what? That's not part of the, of the Odyssey.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:38.120
Yes, it is. Cersei, like Jesus, turns a bunch of soldiers into pigs. Right. She raises from the

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:45.240
dead. Did you know she says, John Tsitsi says in lycophron is indicating the resurrection

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:55.000
of Odysseus. Odysseus is Jesus a long time, a millennium before Jesus was millennium.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.840
He was the hero of the Greeks. That's what everybody thought of. He was the example.

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:07.160
What you're getting at is so true. And in fact, Derek Lambert was in the chat. I saw, he left

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:13.640
the comment asking if you've seen Dennis McDonald's, Dennis McDonald's. So Dennis McDonald's put

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:21.080
together all of the mimesis from Homer. That's in the Gospels. And so I want to just give you one

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:27.480
example. Just, just to get your reaction. It's about Cersei too, by the way. And I just want to,

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:31.720
if you don't mind, I just want to get your reaction. I think you really appreciate this.

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:35.800
I really do. I really think you will. So Dennis McDonald put this together. Look at this. Can

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:40.760
you read this or not? I'll read it to you if you can't see it. Yeah. No, I got it. Odysseus in his

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:46.920
crew sailed to the land of the Cyclops and of Cersei. Jesus and his disciples sailed to the

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:51.640
region of the garrisons. All right. So we have two people, two different stories, people sailing.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:55.880
You might be, all right. That's not a big deal. But let's look at the sequence here. On the mountains

01:06:55.880 --> 01:07:03.080
of the Cyclops is innumerable goats grazed. Cersei turned soldiers into swine. On the mountain,

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:08.920
now back to Mark. On the mountain, a large herd of swine grazed. Okay. Odysseus and his crew

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:15.080
disembarked. Jesus and his crew disembarked, the same Greek word. They encounter a savage,

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:22.360
lawless giant who lived in a cave. Jesus encounters a savage, lawless demoniac who lived among the

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:31.720
caves. Polyphemus usually was depicted nude. The demoniac was nude. Now Cersei recognizes Odysseus

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:39.640
and asks him not to harm her. Swear an oath. Orcon, not to plan another plot to hurt me.

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:47.400
The giant Ask Odysseus intended to harm. The demoniac recognizes Jesus and uses that same

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:55.080
root word, orcidso, right? Is that how you say it? Orquico? Orquizo, yes. Orquizo. You not to

01:07:55.080 --> 01:08:00.840
torment me. So we have, all right. So we have these, the sequence of events is lining up here.

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:07.560
Let's keep going. The giant asks Odysseus his name. Jesus asks the demoniac his name. Odysseus

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:15.800
answers, nobody is my name. The demoniac answers Jesus. Legion is my name. Odysseus subdues the

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:22.200
giant with violence and trickery. Cersei's magic turned Odysseus's soldiers into swine.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Jesus subsdues 2,000 demons with divine power and sent them into the swine and drove the swine

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:37.960
into a lake. This is lining up perfectly. Polyphemus, the shepherd calls out to his neighbors.

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:43.320
The swine herds call out to their neighbors. The Cyclops is coming and the site asking Polyphemus

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:49.320
for stolen sheep. The garrisons come to the site to find out about their swine. Odysseus and his

01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:55.400
crew embark. Jesus and his crew embark. And Odysseus tells the giant's proclaim that he had

01:08:55.400 --> 01:09:02.440
blinded him. Jesus tells the healed demoniac to proclaim what God had done for him. Now this is

01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:09.800
just so, it's the same story being retold through a different lens, through a different time,

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:14.840
through a different character. Odysseus and Jesus. You also had the idea of Jesus's feet

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:21.800
being anointed by Eurycleia. Jesus' feet are being anointed by Mary and then he says to her,

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:29.320
you're famed we told far and wide, which Eurycleia, the girl who anointed Odysseus' feet,

01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:35.400
that name Eurycleia in Greek means famed far and wide. Jesus is only putting a pun on the name.

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:41.800
It's too much. It's too good. I thought you'd get a kick out of that.

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:47.800
Yeah, no, I get a big kick out of that. I like to stay in the shallow waters that are just

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:54.120
linguistic. So I'm thinking about his use of the verb there. I'm not impressed with the boarding

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:59.880
and the turn of phrases that are the same. I can do that with a whole bunch of texts. It doesn't

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:08.840
mean they're related. But the content of the progression of the narrative is you have to,

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:16.360
I have to agree, there's a lot of overlap there. It's the sequence of the events that line up.

01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:21.080
They're not scared. They're lined up the sequence. You know what I mean? What if, Neil,

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:29.320
there's also a connection with the, for example, Jason, right? Jason, yeah, his name is Iason.

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:35.080
It is, I keep telling people this, it is the name Jesus and they don't, because they want to say no,

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:43.400
it's Joshua. And I want to say no, because this name is part of a religious right that predates.

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:48.680
It goes all the way back to Mycenaeus. Bronze Age, right? So it's not coming from the Hebrew.

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:56.280
It can't be. There is none. And to add to what you're saying, both of the roots of those words

01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:03.400
have to do with healing. Jason Healer, Joshua, even Joshua in Hebrew has to do with healing.

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:07.240
So they're both, both of these words are coming from a common source.

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:14.680
I think that's what that Pulaskean is. I think that, I don't think it's that the Jews didn't have it.

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:19.720
I think it's that, just like the Egyptians, the Egyptians that absorbed it from 3000 BC.

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:24.200
Mediterranean language, all overlapping, all the Mediterranean languages.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:30.840
And Neil and I are not just making up these Pulaskeans. These are a real people. And the

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:36.200
Georgians will tell you, these are the early Georgians who's, you know, anyway, good stuff.

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:40.280
After the Bronze Age collapse, it's the Pulaskeans that are populated in the Mediterranean.

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:45.480
It makes you think if there's some kind of movement, some of those migrations

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:53.080
cause that sudden change in the population. I don't know, because I mean, why are they calling

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:58.360
them Autochthonous, right? Why is everybody referring to them as the original people?

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:05.080
When we talk about Jewish migration, that's not unusual, right? It's, we watch, we sit down, Neil,

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:11.160
and we watch our, our, Charlton Heston, every Easter. We're about to have him come out.

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:15.960
And for all I know, he's doing it tonight. And he's spreading his arms and he's making

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:21.800
the seed part, right? We're moving these people, right? Guess what? These migrations happen all

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:30.760
the time, right? So this is a dynamic of the world. It wasn't that Jehovah is Jewish, right?

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:36.200
This is coming through. When Jehovah tells Moses, he's like, set up this tent and you're

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:41.320
going to go in this tent. My voice will be there. Boom. It's a Talistarian.

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:47.800
The second voice of God, right? Right. He's, he's working from tradition. He's not bringing

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:53.640
them out ex nihilo. That's what I'm saying. This, this was a, the way they, the way Leviticus

01:12:54.520 --> 01:13:00.200
just prescribes how the priest is supposed to come in and, you know, sacrifice the bull

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:06.280
and sprinkle the blood seven times on the altar. These are straight from the ancient pagan world

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:12.120
on how to get an oracle from a different God, any God. Yeah. Whatever you set up their tent,

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:19.560
you set up their, their, their oracle with, with the, with the altar the same way. So the way,

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:24.680
the way they're worshiping Jehovah is no different than somebody in Phrygia is worshiping

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:31.800
Sabazios or somebody in the, in Libya worshiping Ammon. They're all doing it the same way.

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:39.000
Yes. And that Neil is what this letter of Pseudo-Clement mentions. It says they're showing them

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:45.000
the attitum. That's that space that you're trying to preserve for the oracle. You're

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:53.320
performing the mystery, right? So I don't know why Christians don't put more value and actually

01:13:53.320 --> 01:14:00.440
looking at what their texts are saying, right? Rather than reading everything through the last

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:08.600
16, well, the last 1800 years of Christianity. They're afraid of being like a pagan.

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:14.760
Yeah. Like, why? That's if you want to do religion, do it right. Yeah. These are, these are ancient

01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:21.160
traditions that are going back to before we had writing. And it's the same, it's the same traditions,

01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:27.080
you know, evolving basically, evolving over time. So what are you scared of? It's the same. It's,

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:32.280
you're just following the history, you know, I would love to tell every Christian in the group,

01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:39.960
if I could address every Christian out there and tell them, I've been to the texts and I can tell

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:49.560
you there is no such thing as eternal life. It does not exist. What Jesus himself promised

01:14:51.160 --> 01:15:00.760
was Ionic life. And Ionic life is a place within the operation of the mystery.

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:07.400
So he was saying, straight up, get the same phrase in the Orphic. What is that,

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:15.160
that papyrus, devouring papyrus? And I proclaim Ionic life. Orphi says it.

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:21.880
It's the ion, right? And Christians don't get that because they hear just through an accident of

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:29.080
history and the translating. And it wasn't so accidental because the church fathers had a lot

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:36.200
of poll on how we'll set our doctrine and our ideas. And as soon as you get doctrine and ideas,

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:42.280
you're, excuse me, you're live, so I'm not going to be rude about it, but you're in a bad place.

01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:48.680
Your vision is obscured from the actual evidence because that's what we get in the actual evidence.

01:15:49.400 --> 01:16:00.120
So there's no salvation, right? There is the soter. There is the soteria. And the first soteria

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:10.360
is described in the Orphic hymns to this female divinity who is a virgin mother, right? So you

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:16.920
can see how the Orphics would be able to grasp. She's also the light bringer, the Luciferia.

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:24.040
Exactly. Right? The light bringer, which is what they call Diana up in the Crimea. People were

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:28.920
like asking the other day on the channel, where's the Diana of Nemus? Where is she from in Italy and

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:33.720
all that next, you know, we're talking about the lake and all that kind of stuff. All this stuff

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:43.080
is coming from that Diana who lives in the Crimea. And she has the right of sacrifice. Any stranger

01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:51.880
that washes the shore, she kills them. She kills them in a right. Why? Because she was killed

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:59.240
in a right. They're perpetuating the same priesthood. So, and for those of you who are Christians,

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:04.840
the mystery is not a question. It's not a secret. The mystery is an operation

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:13.720
that these religions are doing. It is a practice. So when you hear mystery and Paul the Apostle is

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:20.280
talking about mystery, you are not hearing what they were saying. I tell this to my seminarians

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:26.280
every year because I feel bad. Feel bad for the Christians. I tell them, I say, you have not read

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:33.000
the Bible. You think you have, but you have not. Neil knows that once you start looking at the Greek,

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:37.800
then it all of a sudden opens up and I'm not talking about the stuff that comes canned

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:42.920
out of a seminary. I'm not talking that. I'm talking about the stuff that you need that'll

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:48.280
allow you to read ancient medical texts or ancient epics or anything like this.

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:55.080
This is, this is Kalamikis, Kalimakis written around the same time as the Septuagint was

01:17:55.080 --> 01:18:02.520
translated, right? So it's that Alexandrian 3rd century BCE Greek. In here, there's a hymn to

01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:11.240
Artemis. So this is, we're talking, and it says, she is quoting her saying, I want to be a virgin

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:20.760
forever and let me be the light bringer, Luciferia. The virgin light bringer, Soteria, a savior,

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:27.640
virgin, light bringer, all these tropes that you see with the Christ. It's already being

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:36.520
applied to these other gods way before Diana, who's Artemis, is a savior, virgin, goddess.

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:44.680
It's just, this is all, this is, it's, this is the way religion is done. Christianity can just

01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:49.240
pop up out of nowhere and start this new thing that no one's heard of before and no one's done.

01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:57.080
This is the, this is business as usual. Nothing different is going on here. Just, this became the

01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:01.960
religion of the West, became the Roman Empire's state religion. So everybody thinks it's special

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:06.520
now, but like, it could have been, it could have been any of these, any of these traditions that

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:14.760
made it that way. You know? They called it the way. They called it the way. Oh, don't, oh, don't.

01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:22.680
Yep. Yeah. And that's what, when you're walking it, when you're engaging that mystery,

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:28.760
you understand. And it puts you in a place where when he said Soteria, when he said salvation,

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:35.640
people would have understood, right? And then what's really creepy, what's really creepy,

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:41.000
you know, everything about this, that says that there are certain things that we have to deny,

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:47.880
right? Certain things we have to deny. I don't want you telling people. When Jesus is talking,

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:54.040
preaching, you get your funny Western vision of him standing on the hill in his sheet, right?

01:19:54.040 --> 01:20:00.040
And he's not like this and he's like, my people, you know, blessed are the meek, right?

01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:10.360
Wait a minute. Is this the same Jesus who walks around speaking in analog so that people won't

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:15.160
understand what he's saying? It's not so that they will. Jesus doesn't walk around saying,

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:21.000
I'm going to give you an example. It's a metaphor for you to figure out, right? So it'll further

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:27.880
explain what I'm saying. He doesn't say that. It says he purposely kept them. It's so that the

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:35.960
people who are outside, those who are not initiated, remember, he is a mystagogue. The letter says,

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:43.800
Jesus, the mystagogue, it's in there. So what do we, you know, he fits the profile perfectly.

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:48.760
And you got the hero fan thing, too. Yeah, yeah. All the titles that he's getting,

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:54.120
in the revelation, the author of the revelation calls him Lucifer. Yeah. Calls him the son of

01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:59.400
the morning, the dawn. That's Lucifer. Right. He's the morning star. He's the morning star. He's

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:04.920
getting all the same titles. He's getting all these mystery religion titles. Yeah. Yeah. So if

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:10.040
he is, and if, you know, in the book of revelation, a lot of Christians don't realize it, but in the

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:21.720
book of revelation, he's wearing a woman's nightie. He's wearing a bra that is made for a woman. And

01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:29.560
it says it's around his breasts. And it's the Greek word for the feminine breasts. Has it been used

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:34.200
for males before? That's where people are like, wait a minute, wait a minute. But the thing that

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:42.040
he puts around them that, that it's usually translated as girdle, that's a part of his kit

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:47.800
that is the morning star's kit. And the morning star is originally a woman. The morning star is

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:57.240
originally Urania. And so if Urania, the morning star has this kingdom, and the word Urania there

01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:03.560
is the word for heaven, right? She is the one in charge of the heavenly kingdom. Jesus is just

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:10.360
taking that machinery and bringing it to himself. Does it make sense then that he has to be with the

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:17.240
naked boy at four a.m.? Yeah, because he's deriving an antidote for a cup that apparently at the time

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:24.600
he doesn't want to take. He knows how crazy this is, what they're doing. Right. He says that in the

01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:31.080
same chapter he says, take this cup away from me. No one knows what he's talking about. It's all

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:38.200
there in chapter 14. He just brought it back full circle to me. All the language is there. So if you

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:45.240
were some, if you were an Alexandrian initiates in the first century, and someone brought this text

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:49.160
marked to you, you're reading 14, you would, you would know exactly what this is. You would say,

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:55.320
I know what's going on here. There wouldn't be this big question like we're here today in 2023.

01:22:55.960 --> 01:23:03.560
No, no, no. The Greek ear of the first century would know what this is. They would understand

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:08.520
right away. And if you weren't in the group, you weren't initiated. Maybe you weren't one of those

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:14.360
boys that went through the process, but you were on the outside, and you knew this is a thing about

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:21.480
hearing, you know, and there's code. And you saw Romans coming into Alexandria, arresting

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:28.680
Christians for taking little kids off the street. Right. They're arresting Christians

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:37.640
for abducting and abusing children. Right. If you didn't have ears to hear, you'd be like those

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:44.920
cultists. Right. Well, you'd know, you'd know this is part of the deal. And people don't realize

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:51.560
my religion, the religion that I'm trying to replace my democracy with its deocracy,

01:23:51.560 --> 01:24:00.440
that is built upon pederasty. It is built upon dudes getting arrested in public parks

01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:05.960
at 4am and saying, why are you coming at me with all the weapons? I'm not dealing any kids here.

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:15.480
Dude, that's such, that's exactly what it is, man. That's crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Somebody actually

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:21.400
super chatted before you even brought up the secret mark chat GPT. Thanks for the super chat.

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:26.280
It's the same kid from the secret gospel of mark. This is before you even brought that up. So

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:33.080
kudos to chat GPT for being on it like that. Yeah. That's a good point. But um, yeah, this was

01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:38.440
draw. Oh, snappy. Oh, thank you for the super chat. Love you guys. Please talk about what happens

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:45.160
in the sacred groves. Ammon gives us the mystery all the best. This is what it's all about. Because

01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:51.240
we didn't even mention this. We're in the sacred grove to begin with this chapter. They go to get

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:58.040
sent me. That's a sacred grove. I've been there. I've been to Israel. I went to the Garden of

01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:03.880
the Assembly. You know what's right next to it? A giant cemetery. It's a sacred grove. You don't

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:12.520
a sacred grove is a garden next to a cemetery. Period. They're in the sacred grove and snappy is

01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:21.720
onto something here because mystery cults perform their rights oftentimes in a sacred grove. Yes.

01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:28.120
And that Timonus that right that Timonus that place that you cut, it's literally the place that you

01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:36.840
cut off from the what we would call the secular world, right? It's the place where that divinity

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:43.160
and all those places they have some source or some power. It's usually like a spring when Numa

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:53.640
whose name if you were to write it in Etruscan would say amen. When Numa went to his meetings

01:25:53.640 --> 01:26:03.320
with Nigeria, the thousand year old purple using Etruscan Wates priestess who they say came.

01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:10.040
Anyway, divine. They talk about a divinity. When he when he was doing his thing, it's the same

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:20.840
process, right? That they're entering into and that power he goes to he goes to Nigeria at a sacred

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:31.640
place at a place with a little spring, right? A garden. It's sometimes described as a garden.

01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:37.320
Yeah. And it still exists. We have the niche in Rome where this was.

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:44.520
Gorgeous. Love it. But yeah, he's there in this cemetery. Notice every time he's getting caught

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:51.000
is in the cemetery. Even Cyprian, you know, comes stumbles out of the cemetery with the

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:59.880
says the venom coming out of his bottom out of his anus, right? Those places, those burials,

01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:07.880
you know, those those wild centers, right? Yeah, this Garden of Gethsemane is a real,

01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:14.520
you know, it's a real place to hang out with with naked boys. I mean, that's this is me.

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:19.960
When I was in Israel, I took got some footage of the garden and there's Christians flocking

01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:24.680
around. Obviously Christians from all over the all over the world flocking here. That's

01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:29.720
and supposedly in a thousand year old tree or whatever. But I was more interested and I want

01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:32.840
to know what's going on inside this church right next to it. They build right next to it. It's a

01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:38.600
Catholic church they got. And sure enough, they have the image of the arrest right in the middle

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:44.040
of the church is the image of the arrest. They had the different scenes going on. There's him

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:49.880
sitting there. And then look, they have there's there's the arrest right there. And there's

01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:57.720
your there's your boy right there. So this is there this they got this place in they have a

01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:05.160
church built all based on chapter 14. It's all the scenes of chapter 14 are on the walls in the

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:10.440
church. How come my kids not naked, Neil? He's supposed to be naked. You know, you know, they

01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:14.520
would never that's that's revealing. That's probably in the that's probably in the back room.

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:23.400
They probably have that. That's the inner mystery. See how powerful it is. If you control the text

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:29.400
and you control the information, you can tell anybody anything you want. Neil, you were telling

01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:35.640
me the other day, you were saying, Hey, there's this Antikythera thing, this computer thing

01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:41.800
that the big school working out and then tons of dark ages that follow it. You know, it makes you

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:46.200
wonder. I think I just want to bring up your point. Oh, let me let me let me add to what you're

01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:50.920
saying right now. Check this out. So I'm going to share my screen. I'm going to go over here.

01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:57.240
And because no, this is such a good point. Antikythera mechanism. Okay, look at this.

01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:06.440
This is a hand powered analog computer that used to predict astronomical positions

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:13.800
and eclipses decades in advance. Okay, this was received from a shipwreck and it's dated to the

01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:21.640
third century BCE. Okay, second century BC. Sorry. All I'm saying is, if this is what the Greek world

01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:31.800
was producing with paganism at the helm, why is it that it took a 2000 years after Christianity

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:40.440
rose out and became the central culture, as you will, where knowledge is considered evil?

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:45.320
Let's go right to Genesis one. The tree of knowledge is evil. You know, it's better to just

01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:51.720
worship and pay your your 10% and, you know, you know, give all of our resources to the church and

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:56.440
let the church guide us through the as the light in the darkness. That was the way that people

01:29:56.440 --> 01:30:02.760
lived in Western society for 1500 years. And there is no no one building computers.

01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:10.840
They were already doing this before that. So I'm arguing that Christianity kind of held

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:16.200
the world back a little bit. My night might disagree. Go ahead. You feel free to disagree

01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:21.320
all you want. That's my personal opinion is that I think there would be a lot quicker

01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:28.840
advancements if we let if the metropolitan way continued. That makes sense.

01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:37.880
Yeah, we certainly wouldn't have been putting guys like Galileo in prison and whatnot. And

01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:44.760
that's what I don't get, Neil. Why does the modern American audience not understand that this thing

01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:51.880
that you relish and that you celebrate worship and love because you know, you do democracy.

01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:58.280
You love this thing called democracy. And you don't realize it didn't come from Christianity.

01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:06.680
Christianity overthrew democracy. It's spirit across the world. Christianity suppressed.

01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:12.120
It was a thing back in the fourth century Athens, the fourth century BCE Athens.

01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:17.960
It was a literally literal democracy, more democratic than we ever know.

01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:25.640
Yeah, it's radical. It's radical, right? When you are there and you have the ability to make

01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:31.880
the choice that you don't have somebody telling you, this is your God, right? The things were

01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:39.080
like screw everything. We're worshiping a virgin and people are free. People are free here and

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:45.240
people say debate. Oh, well, to what degree did they have freedoms? Forget you. The fact

01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:53.480
is, they were fighting for that freedom. And that freedom is the same thing. You find it again

01:31:53.480 --> 01:32:01.720
in this letter of Pseudo-Clement. He talks about the Eleutheria that is part of the mystery,

01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:09.320
that complete unassailable freedom. And that is always, Bacchus is always protecting the virgin.

01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:14.200
There's a reason and Athens is where that first theater is. People don't realize it. There are

01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:21.240
no Christians that invented the theater. They didn't, doesn't happen, will never happen, right?

01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:27.880
It was the Greeks who worshiped the virgin, who came up with democracy, who had the theater

01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:35.720
constructed. And it was just a place to land the Bacchic procession. It was just a place to

01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:41.480
land the Bacchic procession. That's where we get democracy. So when anybody stands up today and

01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:50.600
tells you, God has blessed the USA, no, no, the virgin, right? The virgin has blessed us. Yeah,

01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:54.840
yeah. We need to preserve that. We need to preserve that.

01:32:54.840 --> 01:33:00.360
Yeah. Could this have been a Paul teaching? Because Paul was more of a mystery teaching

01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:11.080
than Joshua. Mark traveling with Paul. It's interesting. It's interesting. Maybe. I'm not

01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:17.080
really, that's, what do you think? Do you have any opinion on that? I will. Neil, I'm going to be super

01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:22.920
rude, but you know my contract with the devil. I can't discuss. I'm going to take a break and

01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:30.280
you, because I understand, hey, everybody who's out there, no criticism. I understand this is

01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:39.320
part of how this runs as a way to feed Neil and to keep his journalism, because this is better

01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:45.800
than, this is not just YouTube show. This is journalism that you're doing. This is historical

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:51.160
journalism. I'm going to give you a chance to answer all of your, take a break and come back and

01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:58.120
yeah, you're fine. I'll be back. I'll be back. All right. So now this is a good question, Durin.

01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:07.560
I thought, because yeah, Paul, he has a lot of, the way Paul is interacting with the world that

01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:15.560
he's living in, is he is extending his hand to the pagan world and saying, you know, if you're

01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:21.480
with a people in a crowd and they're offering a, you know, they're offering to, you know, meet

01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:30.360
sacrifice to idols, we're all Romans here. Let's, let's chill. Let's, let's relax. So yeah, you might

01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:36.120
be on to something there. This might be a Pauline thing for all we know. I'm not sure the question

01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:44.040
is how much is the gospel of Mark connected to Paul and maybe there's a big connection. Maybe

01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:49.560
there isn't. That's where the question is. So that's what I would look into. That's a good question

01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:56.200
though. I never thought about that. How much is Mark taking from Paul? Good question, actually.

01:34:56.200 --> 01:35:01.000
Really good question because we all, it's, it's already established that Mark comes after Paul.

01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:09.880
So your, your question is, is a spot on. It deserves to be explored for sure.

01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:19.640
Oh, let's see. The next one is from evangelicals never lie with a giant super chat. Wow.

01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:28.280
Thank you. Thank you. I so appreciate this. Thank you that you did not have to do that.

01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:32.600
And I appreciate it. And I really, really, I can't even say how much I appreciate it.

01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:38.840
Ben, a while since I bought you don't says I bought you don't pissed me. Hold on.

01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:42.440
Am I reading this right? Ben, a while since I bought you don't pissed.

01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:48.680
Great stuff, dude. Very interesting. Well, I appreciate it so much. I really,

01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:55.240
I can't even just words cannot describe how much I appreciate this. And uh,

01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:59.880
yeah, I, you, you, and like, like, I don't know what type of before he left this.

01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:05.560
You're the reason why I'm allowed to be doing this and drop daily videos. And I'm trying to

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:11.800
keep up that pace is just, I'm just working and you know, these, the days when I go live are

01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:18.520
actually my days off from putting together like edited content. So the next video I have coming

01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:23.800
out next, um, before I get to the next super chat, I just want to show you guys the next video.

01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:28.360
I'll give, I'll actually, I'll show you my, um, thumbnail. That's what I'll do.

01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:36.280
I'll show you the thumbnail, the thumbnail for my next video. Wait, do I even have it?

01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:49.880
Um, maybe I don't have it with me. But anyways, the next video I'm doing is about Lucifer.

01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:56.760
How does Lucifer become Satan? You're probably asking, what do you mean Satan is Lucifer?

01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:03.000
No, no, no, no, no Lucifer started off as a totally different thing is from the Roman religion side.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:10.280
Lucifer is Lucifer is the male version of Venus. How does Lucifer become Satan?

01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:17.720
And how does Lucifer become the devil? How does Satan become the devil? All of that.

01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:20.840
There's a, there's a three different questions that are being asked. There's aren't the same

01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:28.680
Satan is in the, and there's a Jewish context of Satan being the accuser. There's also this root

01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:34.200
word of set. There's also this different devil characters. There's also underworld gods like

01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:41.000
Pluto and Hades. And then there's Lucifer, who's a light bringer who's not evil at all.

01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:45.160
And then you also have fallen gods that get in trouble like Prometheus.

01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:49.720
You have Apollo getting in trouble and falling down to earth and being,

01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:55.560
so you have these different traditions. And that's my next video coming out next.

01:37:55.560 --> 01:38:02.760
How does Lucifer become the devil? And Chthonius is, this is the last super chat I'm on, so you

01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:08.840
don't have to, you can chill for this one. Chthonius says, if Jesus would have succeeded,

01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:16.920
what would have happened to the boy, Ganymede, or sacrifice or initiate, would he have been holy?

01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:25.000
Wow. Chthonius, Chthonius is going deep into the mysteries. I know Chthonius personally,

01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:33.160
and this is someone who really, really likes to study this stuff. So, um, yeah, if Jesus would

01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:41.160
have happened to the boy, Ganymede, or sacrifice or initiate, would he have been holy? Yeah,

01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:47.880
right? Isn't that how that works? I'm guessing. Christine Wilson, next for the Super Sticker.

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:51.400
Appreciate you so much. Appreciate you so much. Amon, what do you think about all this?

01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:58.920
I just came back to the devil. I heard you talking about the devil, and I love it, Neil.

01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:04.280
That's the video that I'm coming out with, either tomorrow, let me just say, actually,

01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:09.320
it won't be ready by tomorrow morning, but it might be ready by tomorrow evening. If not by

01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:17.080
tomorrow evening, the next, the 21st morning, Tuesday morning, that video will be done.

01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:25.560
Promise that. And it's, when does Lucifer become the devil? And it's deep, I'm going deep into

01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:33.160
this one, because there's a lot of explaining to do. It's not simple. Yeah. Bring the dawn,

01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:41.080
brother. Bring the dawn. Yeah. Yeah. Love it. Love it. People are shocked when they find out the

01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:47.560
venous, you know, is the devil. People are kind of shocked at first. I don't know. You get down

01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:54.520
there and she's got a skirt on, right? And you may think one way, you may have been taught one

01:39:54.520 --> 01:40:00.760
tradition, but when you get down there, the devil and realize as you lift up that Mediterranean

01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:14.360
short skirt, there is a large penis there. This is, this is Venus, the mother of the Roman people,

01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:22.680
right? It's fantastic. And to go even deeper than that, because you know how in the Greek religion,

01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:31.000
when you have two gods that, that, that mates, have sex, whatever, and create an offspring,

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:37.160
God, oftentimes those two, it's, it's, there's a reason for the genealogy. You have two different

01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:46.760
priesthoods coming together. Venus and Dionysus have an offspring. You know exactly where I'm

01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:51.320
going with this. Yeah. Go for it. Sing it, brother. This is one of the most important mystery,

01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:59.560
religion gods of the ancient world. And it's hermaphrodite. So it's, no, no, as it hermes,

01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:07.080
I'm sorry, is it hermes and aphrodite, not, not Bacchus. Yeah. Hermes and aphrodite created God

01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:16.600
named hermaphrodite. Hermaphroditis. Hermaphroditis. Okay, thank you. And this is, this was a very

01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:22.920
important deity in the ancient world of the mystery religions, because you're bringing together these,

01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:32.760
these, you have the angelos. The word angel comes from angelos, messenger. Hermes was the logos.

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:40.200
He was the word of Zeus, the messenger. He was an angel. He was the angelos. And he

01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:48.760
creates with aphrodite, who's Venus, the Luciferia, the Lightbringer, this goddess, Hermaphroditas.

01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:55.480
So you have this important genealogies happening in the Greek, in the, because there's a deeper

01:41:55.480 --> 01:42:02.040
meaning behind this stuff. Like for example, Thanes, this is going to get crazy right now.

01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:09.800
You're about to say it's about to get crazy. Thanes is the, is the, the primordial being

01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:16.920
that comes from chaos. He's the beginning. He's the, he's the, the highest God there is.

01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:24.520
And then from Thanes, you get Eros and Nix. What is this? What is this? Come on, don't just jump out

01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:30.600
like that. Tell us, what did Zeus do to Thanes? What did he do to him?

01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:36.680
It's an orphic, in the orphic fragments. Remember that you were looking at?

01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:42.920
Yeah. He, he, he blows them. Yes. Yeah. I was, I was getting there. I was getting there.

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:48.520
I was going to get, oh, I'm sorry. No, no, no. That's what I'm saying. Thanes. So there's,

01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:55.720
there's weird, there is this secret mystery religion language about Thanes where they'll say

01:42:55.720 --> 01:43:01.960
Thanes is Bacchus or Bacchus is Thanes. And then they'll say, this is in the Durveni

01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:10.280
Papyrus, by the way, that Zeus was there from the beginning. Okay. That's weird. He's the,

01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:15.400
he's the beginning and the end, the Alphan Omega. Oh, that's weird. Then it says that Thanes is

01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:21.160
Priapus. So like, normal, any normal person's scratching their head going, what's going on here?

01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:25.640
Why is, why are all these gods the same person? Why are they all mixed together? Well, it's because

01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:33.800
that original light that came out of chaos, which is Thanes, when, when Thanes gives birth to

01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:40.840
the next generation and it goes down to Saturn or to our nose, who is the heaven god, then to Saturn,

01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:48.120
then to Zeus, then to Bacchus. And then Bacchus has a child with Venus, who's Priapus. They all

01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:53.960
had that spark of Thanes within them. So when Zeus is the beginning and the end, they're talking

01:43:53.960 --> 01:44:00.040
about Thanes. When, when, when Priapus is being called Thanes, when Bacchus is being called the

01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:05.080
divine child, the savior, the king of all the universe. And you're like, wait a minute, I thought

01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:09.400
that was the title for Saturn. That's because they're all had the spark of Thanes in them.

01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:13.880
And that's deep right there. That's what that means.

01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:21.960
It's Jehovah. I'm so hot now, Neil. I'm so hot. You just brought up Jehovah. And it's just, it's

01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:27.960
like, oh, let's look at him and see, and see him for what he is. You know what I mean? He's sucking

01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:36.280
the Edoian, right? That Zeus goes in and sucks that Edoian, right? It doesn't, it, you know,

01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:44.840
don't let it surprise you. All these tyrant gods are subservient to the, the, the, the Thanes, the,

01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:51.080
the primordial chaos, the light and the darkness, the lightbringer, the Lucifer. They're all

01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:57.240
subservient to that. They're always bound to fail. People don't realize the poles are flipped,

01:44:57.960 --> 01:45:06.200
right? And the good guy who brings you reason and doesn't lie to you is the one that years

01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:14.280
saying is the devil, right? When it's your Jehovah who is destined to fall.

01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:21.640
And this goes back to this, even the Sumerians told that Anki, Anki's the one, Anki's the one who

01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:29.480
tells Arthahassis that Anu is going to wipe all you out. You better build an ark. This is the

01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:37.000
story you get with Dukallion. Instead of Anki, it's Prometheus. Prometheus is the savior. He

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:41.400
tells the humans how to survive because Zeus is a tyrant who's going to kill you all. It

01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:45.480
doesn't like you, but Zeus doesn't want any humans to live. He's going to kill everybody.

01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:50.360
Build a boat, take your wife with you and you can, and I'll tell you how to survive.

01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:56.200
I'll tell you how to eat from the tree of knowledge and become like a god. That's the side. That's

01:45:56.200 --> 01:46:04.920
the good side. That was the father of the civil. Yeah, who did that. And Pulascus was her brother.

01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:12.360
Ew, we're going back prehistory. It's in the genealogy. No, but this is what's so brilliant

01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:19.240
about the Greeks is that in these myths, they're writing, they're giving us like,

01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:23.720
not only scientific treatises about like Big Bang and like, I'm not saying Big Bang,

01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:29.400
but like there's like these little scientific treatises injected in the text, but they're also

01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:37.160
telling history that the, the Pulascians, the, the, um, in the genealogy of these gods is this

01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:44.680
genealogy of historical tribes that existed in the Mediterranean world and they're, and they're

01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:50.040
preserving it in the myths. Brilliant. It's brilliant stuff. It really is. You got to,

01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:56.760
you got to hand it to the Greeks. Brilliant. They really were just amazing at preserving history

01:46:57.480 --> 01:47:01.560
in the myths. Now historians and scholars can look at these myths and say,

01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:05.960
oh shoot, they're telling the story about the Pulascians coming out of the Black Sea region after

01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:10.440
a flood and, and populating the world. That's what they're doing. They're telling that story.

01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:18.040
That's why whenever I read ancient texts, I focus on the material evidence. Just show me the dildos,

01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:27.400
show me the drugs, show me the purple anuses, you know what I mean? Show me the, yeah, no, show me

01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:35.800
the, it's all in the text, you know, kids cutting their testicles off and throwing them into the

01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:40.680
home where they have to get all the clothing from because they're going to be dressed like

01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:47.000
girls from now on. That's in the right. That's the mystery religion of the Phrygians.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:54.040
To look at their identity, I guarantee you. On March 25th, every year, they would initiate

01:47:54.040 --> 01:48:00.840
new eunuch priests to take care of the temple of Kaiboli and they had, they had to mimic what Addis

01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:06.440
did and castrate themselves and then throw their testicles into the house. That's whoever,

01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:10.920
whoever caught that testicle had to go, they, there was their duty to bring the clothing out,

01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:18.200
right? Tell them. Let's run this by. I'm a eunuch priest. I just castrate myself. I throw my

01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:24.920
testicles into your house. Now, what does that mean to you? It means I got to make sure that you

01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:32.200
look nice. I've got to provide you with some good clothing. It is, it's my religious duty

01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:37.640
to do it. I don't care if you've got any daughters or not, right? This is a something,

01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:46.840
it's a religious duty. It's a sacred thing. And by the way, Lucian says some people who came just

01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:53.480
to watch this because, you know, like you said, it's a, you know, it's a holy event. It's a festival,

01:48:53.480 --> 01:49:03.560
right? Some people who come to watch get caught up in the process and end up out there naked in

01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:13.960
front of the population cutting their testicles off. Wow. And this is, this is because they really

01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:20.040
believe in these rights. Yeah. They're practicing the sacred ancient, and these Phrygian rights

01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:25.560
weren't new. They were going, and they said that the Phrygians got their rights from Samoth race.

01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:31.080
Yeah. Yeah. Yassion, this is the story that, and even Clement talks about this in his

01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:39.320
explanation of the Greeks. Yassion laid with Demeter in a fall night, right before fall came,

01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:43.640
and then Zeus struck him down with lightning bolt. But they say before that happened, he brought the

01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:54.680
rights to Phrygia. Yassion, right? Jason or Jesus, same name. And there's actually some text that

01:49:54.760 --> 01:50:01.960
spell Yassios with an S at the end. It's a title. It's a title, right? It's a title within the

01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:07.640
cult. It's a healer. Right. Yeah. And it comes from, you're exactly right to point out that

01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:14.120
yaho root. People think that it's used in magic, by the way, just those Greek letters,

01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:25.720
iota, alpha, omega, is part of a magic ritual. It is the saying of the I am that I am, right?

01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:31.880
And it's a healing. They, Paion, they, is one of the shots that they have with it in the rights.

01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:37.000
So you can see these things. I mean, they're in the text. I'm telling you, you take those gospels

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:42.360
and cut out all the sections that have to do with Jesus performing mystery

01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:51.400
as a magus and getting down on a young kid who's acting as the bridge, by the way, Neil,

01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:57.400
the bridge, by the way, with the kid or the drugs, right? That kid is there administering

01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:06.600
that drug to Jesus. That kid is the Ganymede, the cup, right? That kid is the cup. And Jesus

01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:13.160
is taking that cup and it poisons his ass. And he ends up not getting the antidote and screaming

01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:19.560
on the cross and dying early. Neil, we know for a fact, all the evangelicals out there, please

01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:28.360
support this. We know for a fact, Jesus did not die of crucifixion. He did not die of crucifixion.

01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:34.920
Ask the next religious historian, say this crazy guy said, Jesus didn't die of crucifixion.

01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:40.200
That's what the texts say, right? Because the Romans were like, fuck, they even noted it.

01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:45.560
They're like, oh, he was dead early. He's hanging up there. You know, he shouldn't be dead yet.

01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:50.680
Quick, right, right. Right? What's going on? Right? You know what's interesting about that.

01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:54.680
I'm going to go ahead and finish that thought. Well, he's screaming. I just want you to realize

01:51:54.680 --> 01:52:00.280
he's there screaming, right? And he's yelling out his stuff about being thirsty. He's yelling

01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:07.720
out a phrase which strangely enough looks like it's been lifted the sabbathon directly from

01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:16.360
the magical papyri that you're contemporary that Paul is saying, throw your magic books out, right?

01:52:17.080 --> 01:52:24.040
Guess what? Jesus is using one. Yeah, right. Look, look, look, you just nailed on what I was

01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:30.360
about to say. So that sabbathon thing, right? Everyone's pointed out that it's in Psalm 22.

01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:37.480
Okay. They chose that Psalm for a reason because it's pointing to the sabbathon.

01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:45.080
My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? But the Greek, if you look at the Septuagint version,

01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:50.120
there's something happening there with the sabbathon. But listen to this, though.

01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:55.880
Put that aside for a second. You got the sabbathon on the cross. He's yelling out,

01:52:55.880 --> 01:53:01.000
my God, why are you forsaking me? Psalm 22. But the other three Gospels, he's also,

01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:08.360
all three of them have a different Psalm. So when one of them, it's this, my God, the other one,

01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:16.440
it's LOI. Like all three, all four of the Gospels are from a different Psalm. Psalms are songs that

01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:23.480
you sing. They're hymns. Orpheus, when Orpheus is killed by the Maynids, what is he doing?

01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:35.960
He's singing hymns. Both Jesus and Orpheus die singing chants in hymns. It's Orpic. I'm telling

01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:42.280
you it's Orpic. That's what it is. It's Orpic. Why is that? Is it just me or was Orpheus in his,

01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:51.960
before he was torn apart by the crowd of his own followers? He was saying something about naked

01:53:51.960 --> 01:54:00.760
boys, wasn't he? He didn't sweat at all. So this is Orpheus' metamorphosis. Actually, I think I had

01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:06.120
a text right here somewhere. We can just catch people up. We can just catch people up. All right,

01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:15.640
look at this up. Orpheus' metamorphosis, the last story about Orpheus, after the Eurydus story,

01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:24.040
it says that Orpheus was so depressed about Eurydus that he decided to take up the thration rights

01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:32.120
of plucking little boys' manhoods before they come of age, and that women were throwing themselves

01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:37.800
at Orpheus and he was denying them because he was into this stuff now. I'm not just making this up.

01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:44.200
This isn't the text. He's plucking his nectar, people. He's plucking his nectar and he's bringing

01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:52.440
that kid. Galen has the descriptions of the pre-puberty boy, excreta, and the post-puberty.

01:54:52.440 --> 01:55:00.440
He's getting that serious fluid. Why? Because we're cutting him and we're wrapping him with

01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:07.480
wraps so that he can have venom concoctions administered directly. I mean, this is a great

01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:15.080
way to fly, brah. Yeah, eunuchs. You thought all the eunuchs were made by carving. There's also

01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:22.840
chemical ways, right? There's chemical ways for that transformation to find that feminine, to take

01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:30.440
that masculine, and to bring out snappy. There's ways to do that, and they're involved in these

01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:38.760
ways. This should make you, evangelicals, very scared at the same time, very upset that your own

01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:47.640
dude was involved in this kind of activity. You're holding up signs that say, hey, save the children.

01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:58.120
Guess what? Your guy at Putin is abducting them, and your guy, Jesus, was thick in it. Thick in it.

01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:07.720
Yeah, welcome. Welcome to your Christian mystery. Yeah. I was pulling up the text before they say

01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:12.920
that I'm a liar, that I'm crazy. You have to see it for yourself. It's book 11, I believe,

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:18.040
by the depth of Orpheus. So while the songs, let me see. Let me see if I can share my screen.

01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:25.080
Let me see. Damn. Yeah, I'll share my screen right now.

01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:31.560
Just read it to us, Neil. Just read it. I'm trying to find it, actually. It's somewhere in,

01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:38.440
it's somewhere right before he dies. I know that. Let's see. Bacchus and Midas. Bacchus.

01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:44.360
Here we go. I'll talk while you're looking. Oh, did you find it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look for it.

01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:51.160
All right. Talk while I'm looking for it. So he's looking for this myth. It's basically the myth

01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:59.080
that Orpheus was killed by his own menads, right? And that he was killed for that reason because he

01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:09.640
swore off. He swore off the right. He stopped the mystery and declared that he would only worship

01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:20.120
the sun. Yeah, Apollo, right? Yeah. So they cut his head off and threw it in the river and

01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:26.760
he, you know, people will take credit for where that ended up and whatnot. I'll get it ready for

01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:30.680
the next time we do all live because I don't, I gotta go to the bathroom anyway. We've been going

01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:37.480
live for two hours and I'm sure you got stuff to do anyway. But yeah, listen. Look it up.

01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:44.680
Orpheus is metamorphosis. The last thing he does before he gets killed is he takes on the

01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:50.120
Thracian rites. This is what it says. This is not my words. This is Orpheus words. Takes on the

01:57:50.120 --> 01:57:57.160
Thracian rites of plucking little boys' manhoods before they come of age. And he says that they're

01:57:57.160 --> 01:58:01.240
women were throwing themselves at him and he was denying them. That's what it says.

01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:08.840
Just saying what it says. But that's Orpheus. We just went full back circle at the beginning of

01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:15.480
this text. What's happening in Mark 14? Something Orpheus happening. That's what it is. Something

01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:20.600
mysterious. Something. Oh, sorry. You, I missed your super chat. Have you made a video on the

01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:25.160
exiting Soul Trap? Have you spoken with Howdy Missak? I will look into that. That's a good

01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:31.320
question. Thank you for the super chat. But yeah, back to full circle again. What is happening

01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:39.000
in Mark 14? It's the mystery. That's what's happening. Last final thoughts on this.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:50.520
My final thoughts, if I can have any, are that we need to just accept the evidence.

01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:57.720
We don't need any ideas. We don't need any theories. We just need to look at the texts that are there

01:58:57.720 --> 01:59:03.560
and to determine, okay, what are they using? How are they using it? It's just good detective work.

01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:11.240
And in doing so, we can free people from the narrative that they've already been fed.

01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:18.200
And that is causing this great, I mean, this is our duty, man. If Tom Jefferson were here,

01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:26.600
he was a classicist. He'd be like, you people, you know, oh, Neil, Neil, when are they going to

01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:33.880
listen? When are they going to listen? It's, oh, you know, um, yeah, that's all I can say. Hey,

01:59:33.880 --> 01:59:38.840
have you heard from Anastasia at all? Do you have any updates? Everybody's

01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:46.040
She's, uh, she was talking about how one of her friends who was a, who was a male stripper.

01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:52.840
And I, it reminds me of what you said about Hercules. Hercules putting on the, you know,

01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:59.320
putting on the costume of the garb of the women and, uh, then going to war because this male

01:59:59.320 --> 02:00:05.000
stripper is dressed up ready to fight the Russians. She was posing pictures with them. I was like,

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:10.680
that's all the Ukrainians. I love the Ukrainians so much. They're the heroes of today. They're,

02:00:10.680 --> 02:00:14.760
that's those are the Bacchic warriors right now. That's Hercules and Bacchus over there.

02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:21.720
What is it, Neil? Do you think it's the tension? Like at a specific place and time, you know,

02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:27.480
that you'll have this force attracted and you can really concentrate. I mean, the place where they

02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:37.720
hung the fleece was sacred to Mars. So it's a, it's a war environment. Is it that war environment

02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:46.200
that suddenly brings that virgin, you know, that somebody can be the receptacle then? I mean,

02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:52.760
I don't mean to be creepy or culty or anything, but if you think about it, the people then who are

02:00:52.760 --> 02:01:01.400
in that environment like Anastasia, it, she be, can become the receptacle for real freedom for

02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:08.920
that actual spirit of Athena. Am I crazy or? No, that's what it is. That's that. I think of the

02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:16.120
democracy versus whatever Russia, I mean, I guess it's like an oligarchy, right?

02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:23.080
That's that Republican oligarchy, you know, where the, the billionaires are deciding the

02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:30.360
fate of the people. Whereas the Ukraine has that like that, that symbol of lady liberty

02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:37.400
holding up the, the, the, the scale in her hands and the sword in the other hand. And that's Ukraine

02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:44.040
right now. That's Ukraine right now. Ukraine is embodying that spirit right now. That's the lady

02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:51.240
with the scale and one hand and the sword on the other hand. Ukraine, that's who you are right now.

02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:59.800
That's how I see it. She's the virgin male. I mean, if we're going to find Athena somewhere,

02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:07.640
there ever be somewhere, you know what I mean? Oh, I can't, I can't wait. This is fantastic.

02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:13.800
You know, it's, it's terrible to, it's terrible to see something beautiful and something that's so

02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:21.160
dark. But I mean, that's what dawn is, right? That's what that's what the dawn bringers do.

02:02:22.120 --> 02:02:27.640
Right. This is, I wish we could speak about all the cult. We didn't even get to the,

02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:35.480
the, the, the panto clator and the connection to Mithras. Did you know here, I'll leave with,

02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:40.600
I'll leave with this. Go ahead. Take your time. Take your time. I'll just tease. There's a direct

02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:50.600
linguistic connection between Jesus Christ and Mithras. He is the unconquered son. Yeah, it's

02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:55.080
gorgeous. Yeah, I'll show you the, it's the Bible, man. Nobody ever reads it. I don't know why.

02:02:55.960 --> 02:03:03.960
Yeah. Oh, I also have the link for your YouTube in the description. I'm showing it right now.

02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:09.880
Subscribe to Lady Babylon and what, what twice a week you're going live and you're doing deep

02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:15.880
dives like you just heard today. So the, if you like what you heard today, Amon does this twice

02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:21.160
a week. He's doing this and he's touching on different subjects in the ancient Greek world

02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:26.280
that nobody's talking about. You'll not get this anywhere else, except for Lady. I'm, I'm not

02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:32.520
kidding. I watch every time you're live. I'm watching every time. So I thank you for the

02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:39.880
opportunity, Neil, to be able to speak. And you know, I want people to know Neil told me last

02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:47.720
week, he was like, you realize we're at war. And I was like, Oh, this guy's crazy. What's he doing?

02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:55.640
You know, I was like, what? And I got to thinking about it over a couple of days, right? And

02:03:56.760 --> 02:04:06.840
he understood. He had a focus and he understood exactly what one of those watchers, one of those

02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:13.240
watchers would give you in Sodom, the exact same thing. Those are the lightning bringers,

02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:19.240
right? Those bring the fire from all on us. This is heavenly kingdom stuff, people. You don't

02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:25.800
realize what's there. It's the apocalypse. Neil, you promised me we bring the apocalypse or we

02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:33.960
don't do it. We are, we this is, this is exactly what that is. Neil and I are two witnesses for you.

02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:46.840
Yeah. And we are witnessing to Jesus Christ, the selling pirate child rapist. Jesus Christ,

02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:54.520
the kid selling child rapist. Druggy, he's on drugs, a lot of drugs, Jesus and drugs.

02:04:54.840 --> 02:05:08.520
Yeah. That's what it is. Oh, shoot, I found it. Orpheus. Such was the grave,

02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:13.240
grove of Orpheus drawn together. He surrounded the seven of my animals. He tried the cords and

02:05:13.240 --> 02:05:19.880
was convinced on the notes, raised the voice, oh muse, was this it? But now, but now for the

02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:25.640
gentler, I would sing for boys, the favorites of the gods, and even of maids, pay the penalties

02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:31.160
for the wrong. Is that it? No, that's something else. Huh. All right, I'll find it next time.

02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:36.600
It's somewhere in Orpheus, or something, somewhere in Ovid. I'll find it for next time.

02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:39.800
And by the way, Neil, no, by the way, you know, it's really cool of it.

02:05:39.800 --> 02:05:42.520
Oh, I found it. I found my Ovid. Okay. Okay, I can hide it now.

02:05:42.520 --> 02:05:44.440
It's very cool. I'll, I'll.

02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:48.280
So glad we held out this long. I found it right now. I have it saved right here.

02:05:48.520 --> 02:05:54.200
Okay. It's so glad. It's so good that you're doing this with Ovid, that you're resurrecting Ovid.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:06:02.200
Doesn't he get imprisoned in the most hostile place, the civilization at the time?

02:06:03.400 --> 02:06:07.320
And it was for Julia, wasn't it? It was maybe for...

02:06:07.880 --> 02:06:12.520
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ovid. Yeah. Okay. Can you, can you read this for me?

02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:13.900
Yeah.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:20.520
Picks. Oh, the top part, the top part. This is from...

02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:27.000
Yeah, with the love of women, with the love of women, perhaps because of his fortune and love,

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:34.840
or he may have plighted his troth forever, but scores of women were burning to sleep with the

02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:41.000
bard and suffered the pain of rejection. Oh, yeah, that's right. You, yeah.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:44.760
Women are throwing themselves at him and he's rejecting them. That's what that means.

02:06:44.760 --> 02:06:50.280
Yeah. You, Elvis, Elvis is not available right before Orpheus gets killed, but keep going.

02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:56.840
Orpheus even started the practice among the Thracian tribes of turning for love to immature males

02:06:57.400 --> 02:07:04.680
in a plucking the flower of a boy's brief spring before he has come to his manhood.

02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:10.120
Welcome to salvation, brothers and sisters. Welcome to salvation.

02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:11.880
Welcome to the mysteries. Yeah.

02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:18.200
So the answer, the answer to the question that we've been, the answer to the question of this,

02:07:18.200 --> 02:07:22.600
of this stream, what is happening in Mark 14? Yeah. Yeah.

02:07:22.600 --> 02:07:30.280
Mysteries. Yeah. Brilliant. Neil, that was the best thing ever produced. Yeah, I can't,

02:07:30.280 --> 02:07:35.560
it's done. It's done. Thank you. You have just attained true gnosis.

02:07:44.200 --> 02:07:46.280
You have just attained true gnosis.

02:07:49.160 --> 02:07:55.400
The demiurge has no power over you.
