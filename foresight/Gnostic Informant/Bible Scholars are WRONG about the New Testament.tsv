0	3160	So, how do people even get jobs in this field?
3160	8480	You could think, okay, is it because they're skilled at deconstructing the Christian religion?
8480	9980	I know.
9980	15720	It's in service to largely the academic world that we call New Testament studies is in
15720	19660	service to Western sacred history.
19660	23480	They're custodians of that, they're custodians of that in so many ways.
23480	33380	These texts were targeting the broader Mediterranean work and you know, that seems beyond dispute
33380	41760	really, but the problem is that there's little work being done to try and contextualize it
41760	48600	within that world and it's a giant wave and to use the analogy, the Christians, they've
48600	52140	got their surfboards out and they're riding the wave but they're not the only ones on
52140	61540	the wave and it re-inscribes the myth of the evolution of Western sacred history that
61540	70220	we evolved out of this like orgy of madness because Christianity came on the scene.
70220	73740	I got to the point when I was writing it, I started to, in my mind, I was having all
73740	79620	of these arguments with all of the supposed leading scholars of our time, there were New
79660	84300	Testament folks and I got to the point where it was just maddening, I just thought, you
84300	86380	know what, that's a waste.
86380	94660	This is actually putting at risk the future, it's an existential threat by, you know, by
94660	102540	possible relation, it produces certain existential threats to our own species in some ways.
102540	104900	To not have clarity on these issues is embarrassing.
110620	118900	Dr. Richard C. Miller is a transdisciplinary research scholar exploring the cultural and
118900	125860	literal nexus between classical antiquity and the social origins of earliest Christianity.
125860	131860	His published work focuses on the mythological roots of the New Testament gospel, the portraitures
131860	137060	of Jesus, the sacralized founding figure of the Christian religion.
137060	143260	Miller undertook his graduate work at Talbot School of Theology, Masters of Divinity, Princeton
143260	149660	Theological Seminary, Yale University, and Claremont Graduate University where he got
149660	151140	his PhD.
151140	155140	This discussion is going to be very controversial.
155140	161260	Your favorite Bible scholar might get dissed whether he's a liberal or conservative, we
161260	162620	don't care.
162620	164060	Are they correct?
164060	165940	Are they bringing the sources?
166020	167980	Are they looking at the data?
167980	169820	We're going to talk about that in this video.
169820	171020	Stay tuned.
171020	175980	And welcome back to the Gnostic Conformant and you are about to attain true gnosis.
175980	181700	Today I'm with Richard C. Miller and you just saw in the intro there, he's got some books
181700	186140	available in the description, we're going to talk about that stuff.
186140	189700	For example, like the one that we're discussing the most, Resurrection and Reception and Early
189700	192940	Christianity, great book.
193020	197980	I just want to get right into the main thing that I want to discuss and we're going to
197980	202540	branch out in different directions when we start talking about this is what is the cultural
202540	207820	milieu that Christianity sort of comes out of.
207820	213540	And it almost seems like you're having, there's one story that you get from tradition.
213540	217540	And then there's another story when you look at the evidence and it seemed to not really,
217540	221500	there's some overlap obviously, but there's something different going on there.
221700	223940	And that's what I want to get into this about.
223940	231100	Is Christianity just a pure offshoot of Judaism in its sense that it claims to be, or is there
231100	236540	other cultural aspects in the broader Mediterranean world that are playing parts in this?
238620	244460	Yeah, I think probably as I've thought about this question for quite a while, as you can
244460	249460	imagine having, you know, gone through my book there and I am staking out a position
249460	252500	with regard to that, that I feel very strongly about.
252500	257500	So it's not an accident that you're asking me this question, Neil.
257500	264140	I would first like to point out that I think there's a tendency going into this.
264140	265940	I think it's a bias that comes into it.
265940	271380	And it's mostly because where do people enter this discussion, usually from a faith background
271380	278420	presented within certain contexts that are interested in training people within their
278460	281260	religious kind of worldview, right?
281260	287820	And so from an academic standpoint, though, I think we need to make a distinction between
287820	293060	the setting in the narrative, like say in the Gospels, what's the setting?
293060	301660	Well, it's Palestine, it's Judea, it's Jerusalem, it's Galilee, it's Samaria, it's these places, right?
301660	307900	And the literary context, well, that's the area where you get all of the cultural fabric,
308700	311660	the linguistic content that's going into this.
311660	315580	Who are the readers and what's their world that they're living in?
315580	317220	What are they swimming in?
317220	319300	Linguistically, culturally.
319300	328820	And those are two very different questions, but they get conflated heavily in New Testament scholarship.
328820	334580	And I think there are a number of reasons for that and we can get into that in this interview.
334580	338500	I know we want to hit on that further in the discussion here.
339900	346140	But just enough to say that these texts were targeting the broader Mediterranean work.
347060	352580	And that seems beyond dispute, really.
353100	361540	But the problem is that there's little work being done to try and contextualize it within that world.
361540	371780	And so there's a sense of trying to sequester it off into Judaism and to see Judaism as if early Christianity were a sect of Judaism
371780	382100	and as if Judaism itself were somehow siloed off culturally from the rest of the broader Mediterranean world at that time.
382100	388700	That's such a good point that I want to highlight that because I think this is where the problem starts.
388700	401380	Judaism as a religion, it develops just like every other religion does, just like every other cultural entity or association or classia, whatever you want.
401380	411060	All these are different associations, Orphism, Pythagoreanism, Platonism, Paganism, whatever that means, like the local mystery cults and all that stuff.
411060	416660	And over in Jerusalem, you have another development and we call it Judaism today.
416660	425340	But this comes out of the same Mediterranean or, I should say, in the broader Middle Eastern world going towards the Babylonians.
425340	431420	And they're drawing from all the same cultural milios and it's the same process happening just in this part of the world.
431420	443660	So I think the biggest mistake we make is we draw a border around Israel and say that's monotheism, that's Judaism, and everyone else is Pagan.
443660	450340	And there's a dichotomy and it's like, it's so wrong to say that, by the way, no one called themselves Pagans, no one.
450340	458860	That's like a derogatory term that happens later, it means like hellbilly, it means like you're a hellbilly, you're not educated, you don't have the Christian faith, you're an idiot, you're a Pagan.
458860	467500	That's not, Paganism doesn't exist, it's just, you have these different cults in different cities, different priesthoods, and they're all drawing from the same cultural stuff.
467500	477380	They all do the same bull sacrifices, they all do the same lamb sacrifices, they all do the same type of oracle systems and they'll have like, temples built the same way.
477380	480980	It's all this, it's like there really is no division happening.
480980	484740	So I wanted to highlight that and I'll let you continue on what you're saying.
484740	502820	Oh yeah, so under the draft within the crucible of say, the Maccabean period, that's when you get the different sects of Judaism rising and it starts to fragment or fracture out into all of these different kind of manifestations or brands or types or permutations.
502820	514700	And let me say something about that too, and people get mad when I cut off people, but this is such a big thing right here, because yes, in the Maccabean period, you're seeing them, you're seeing them push themselves,
514700	530700	push themselves away from the broader Hellenization world, even though they're all named, even though they all have Hellenized names like Jason Maccabean, let's put that aside for now, let's put that aside for now, let's say, okay, they reject all these other cults.
530860	547700	Well, so have you read Plato's Republic, where he says all these different Homeric and Hesiod themes are teaching children to be bad people and we need a better, more up to date type of religion.
547700	560060	And then even beyond Platonism, even beyond the philosophical sects, in Rome in 186 BCE, they were horrified at the Bacchic priesthoods that were surrounding Rome.
560140	562260	And they outlawed the Bacchic cult.
562780	573420	And by the way, Maccabees, the God that they're going up against is Dionysus, specifically, I think Zeus too, but they were talking about the Dionysian procession coming in from Antiochus.
573980	581700	So to me, that's no different than the Romans outlawing Bacchus, and what's the difference there?
581740	582660	There's no difference to me.
582940	586780	So I think it becomes what happens is they're all drawn from the same cultural stuff.
587060	594260	But then once you become your own priesthood, your own entity, that's when you take on an individual role and say it's us versus them type of thing.
594820	606260	But that's not to say that they're like a different planet or they need to have a force field around them and that they can't draw from these other cultural ideas.
606300	608340	That's, you know, and I just wanted to point that out.
608340	609340	What are your thoughts on that?
610260	615260	Well, yeah, so you have the Alexander's Conquest to the East, right?
615740	622900	And you have the different kingdoms that split off from that, that you've got, you know, the Seleucids and Ptolemies, et cetera.
623540	635180	And the Seleucid Empire is basically that's occupying the region that we would consider to be the stomping ground of the New Testament later under Roman governance.
635180	647540	But prior to that, it was, and that's where you get Antiochus Epiphanes and the story in two Maccabees about the martyrs and their resistance to the tyrant.
647580	650260	It's, it's causing the tyrant multiple times.
650780	653060	It's a political resistance largely.
654140	660620	When you get to the Pharisees, you, I mean, they're described even in the New Testament as having embraced a lot of Persian ideas.
660620	676140	You've got demons and apocalypse and resurrection and angels and all sorts of things that are that would be occultic in some ways to a pure kind of idea that you're rising out of classical Hebrew tradition.
676180	680860	And so they're more open-minded, a lot more, actually.
680860	687420	In fact, that's kind of the banner under which they're, they're marching in some ways is that that's their, their posture to all that.
688420	692980	There's the temple that continues to be contested through that period.
692980	700420	And so the Maccabean literature, we have it in Greek, right, which is, that should say enough right there, what's going on.
700420	711540	But there's, there's a tendency to want to convert the temple to Jerusalem, Jerusalem to a temple that's conflates the two deities, Zeus and Yahweh.
712140	730580	They're both mountain deities, the sky deities that are kind of principle and in those different cultures and to try and see the, and if you read against the grain in the Maccabean literature, there was a massive resistance within Judaism against those that were resisting Hellenization.
730580	737100	And so there was pro and, and, you know, there, there, there were, there were those that were in favor and those that were against that.
737420	753380	And some of them wanted to have their city revamped and, and with portugos and colonnades and, and all of the, you know, gymnasia and all of the nice cities of a modern Greek city, you know, they wanted that for their own people.
753660	766900	And, and understandably, and they were open minded to the idea of syncretizing with classical Greek or, you know, Hellenistic, even religious forms, even, even seeing Zeus and Yahweh.
766900	769660	As synonymous to that extent.
769900	773940	And in fact, in Samaria, it succeeds that temple.
773940	788100	If you go back and actually read the Maccabean literature, that the temple where Jesus was also Messiah, you know, when he went to the woman of the well and all that, you know, he was their Messiah to their temple was dedicated to Zeus Yahweh.
788580	797340	Yeah. And Demetrius, Demetrius Philarium, when he wrote that letter to the, I forgot who it was, the high priest, I think it was the high priest.
798340	809540	He says, yeah, you, we call him Zeus, you call him, you call him, whatever, I think he says Yahweh, I can't remember, but it's, it's the, it's the letter that's that Josephus relates.
810180	824140	And it's right before they do the Septuagint translation, he's saying, yeah, you know, your laws are very, very noble and very divine and we were all the same, we're all on the same boat, we, yeah, Zeus, we call him life, Xena, we call him the same as you guys.
824620	827260	And so you can see that sort of thing happening.
827980	853020	And another thing, and you mentioned the gymnasium as an abomination mentioned in Maccabees, but Plato's laws specifically call out gymnasiums as being places where evil happens and children are, you know, homosexuality comes, like, all this, he sort of like says, we need to get rid of these gymnasiums, or we should have them, but they should be really regulated, there's some sort of thing like that.
853620	877060	And it's like, there's an prime example, like you can see, this is something that's developing across the board, where people are, it's like the sort of movement of piety, I call it, like where people are sort of growing out of the, the orgy, you know, the orgy, orgy of religions of, of the ancient world, because those are pretty prominent.
877660	895540	So some of these, uh, Bacchic sex, but it's not just Judaism that's doing this, it's all, all across the board, you're seeing the Orphics, you're seeing the Platonists, the Pythagoreans, and they're all sort of adopting this, well, we should be humble and pious, and we should reject the bodily, bodily pleasures.
895740	901420	And this is sort of a movement that's not, it's happening just across the board in general, and I don't see it just happening in one space.
902220	922780	Yes, the early Christians did not define that, that's the ascetical eschasis, you might want to, you know, that's one way to describe it, and then it comes out of the philosophical tradition, it's a giant wave, and to use the analogy, the Christians, they've got their surfboards out and they're riding the wave, but they're not the only ones on the wave.
923780	933780	They're not defining the wave, they are in some ways taking it to certain extremes through certain manifestations, like Marverdon and these kind of things, but they're not even unique in that.
934300	951100	And so, um, ascetical kind of a disposition that had become very popular, in fact, Veronica Grimm, under whom I studied on the East Coast there, she wrote a book from feasting to fasting, and it basically traces that trajectory from the Homeric period,
951620	977020	all the way into late antiquity, where attitudes regarding, you know, self-discipline and, you know, constraints, self-restraint, austerity, fasting, and the emancipation of that, but it's shown in all sorts of ways, and largely is falling from the classical philosophical traditions.
977020	998180	And so, there's a kind of a polarity there that's going on between, they're criticizing, the philosophers are criticizing a lot of the classical mythological forms, and you know, the indulgence of Zeus is just, you know, they're becoming critics in some ways of that,
998180	1015940	you know, of course, trying to thread that line carefully, not to get themselves into too much trouble, but that's where they're coming from in that, and Christianity arises within that, and is itself a product of that larger conversation and contestation that's going on in antiquity.
1016780	1025180	This is my, okay, this is what I want to get into, because this is my, someone who's not an expert, I'm just a big nerd, and I love reading about this stuff.
1026180	1043180	As, in the same way a nerd of Star Wars would get mad about the new Star Wars movie not being politically correct compared to like the, the canon or whatever, you know, I can sort of relate to that as like someone who's a really nerdy about ancient history and mythology and religions,
1043180	1057180	whereas I'm thinking, why aren't some of these focuses being, some of these areas of study being focused on more by New Testament scholarship, it's only, I'm only seeing it in classicists, and specific like Egyptologists or, you know,
1057180	1077180	you know, Thraciologists that study the origin of Thrace, and like, and I've brought up Thraciologists because there's a scholar, Rujapapava, and PhD at the Institute of Balkan Studies and Center of Thracology, and this person writing all these articles about this religion coming
1077180	1099180	from the Hellenistic region, from the 4th century BC, all through the 1st century, even beyond that, these Ipsisterian people who are worshiping God Most High, and they don't, they don't care about circumcision of the Mosaic laws, but they mingle with Jews, like there's evidence that they're, that they're friends with, they're friendly with the Jews, they like them, they like their scriptures a little bit,
1099180	1125180	but they're not like, then we don't care about circumcision, we don't have images of God, we just worship God, and he's just like this, he's just like this idea, and it's almost like the Platonist God coming, coming forth in this religion, and then you have them, then they find out in these inscriptions, they call themselves Seboi Manoi, or Theosabes, God-fearers, this is what they call themselves, the titles they, these are the people that Paul are writing to in his letters,
1125180	1151180	and not even that, Seboi Manoi is who he addresses in this, in the narrative of Acts, so whoever wrote that, whoever wrote that is making Paul address them in that narrative, so I'm thinking, now I'm not, that doesn't necessarily mean they are Ipsisterians, but I'm, what I'm, what I'm gathering is that at the very least, there's an overlap between the cultural religious attitudes of Thrace and Phrygia, modern-day Turkey,
1152180	1178180	by the way, where Christianity explodes, where the Church of Constantinople is, this is where they move the capital, this is where the Church Fathers of Bithynia, that little area of Bithynia, that's the first time Christianity's mentioned by Plain of the Younger, so we're talking about Christianity seems like more of a development of northern Turkey, southern Thrace, than it is for Israel,
1178180	1197180	yes, and this is my concern, I want to hear your thoughts on this, why is it that people are, maybe they are, maybe I'm just not seeing it, but why is it that it seems like we're not looking at the developments of this region, and how they come out of this region, rather than trying to see it as like this Jewish offshoot?
1198180	1212180	Yeah, that's all great question, well, first off, I think with all the people you've been talking to on your show, great show by the way, Neil, you've had some of the world, the top world experts on here, I'm honored to be a guest,
1212180	1241180	you know, we all probably need to get together and give you, award you with like an honorary doctorate or something like that, you know, or more than many of the people that claim to know so much in our field, and so just a little, yeah, no, it's great to have a conversation, you could run with the best in these conversations, and so it's more than just a Star Wars fan at this point, I think for you, yeah,
1242180	1261180	so I think you're absolutely correct, why aren't we studying the hell out of Bethany, why aren't we studying the hell out of Macedonia and Rome, and the cultural hubs where this religion caught fire and just ignited, why aren't those largely rejected in Jerusalem?
1262180	1284180	Judah is largely unaffected by the rise of Christianity, you could make a case to the contrary, but it'd be pretty puny and scanty that the Judaism was largely, you know, had the rise of Christianity had this massive impact on Judaism, it absolutely was, it was a full scale cultural revolution, though, in the Greco-Roman world.
1285180	1302180	That's where these texts are getting traction, that's where they're being marketed, that's where they're being written, that's where they're being consumed, that's where the religion is taking off, that's where these texts are targeting those contexts and are the earliest evidence.
1302180	1329180	When you look at Paul, where's he at? Is he hanging out writing stuff in Hebrew in Jerusalem? No, he's almost indistinguishable from like an itinerant philosopher in his own right, almost like a, I don't know, an occultic middle Platonist kind of running around with his own cultic conceptions, largely untethered to Judaism.
1330180	1342180	He doesn't not see himself and the earliest Christians are abrogating, they're abrogating, they're giving up nearly every separatist practice that Judaism had claimed at that time.
1343180	1358180	They're giving up circumcision, they're giving up, you know, eating separately, they're giving up, you go down the list and part of the gist or even importance of this literature is that letting go of each one of those pieces, right?
1359180	1376180	And so, and that the mission has shifted to the Gentile, you know, so to speak, the nations, the ethnic, and so that's the narrative that's going on early on and then in the earliest evidence of the Christian tradition or traditions.
1376180	1391180	And so that should be what we're studying. And it's written, these are texts that are written in Greek that are playing on and riffing on and trying to create their own adaptations of the larger within the larger Hellenistic world.
1392180	1398180	And this isn't unique to Christianity. If you go down to Egypt, they're doing the same thing like Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt.
1399180	1404180	They've got their own Hellenistic forms that are built on top of their more ancient forms there.
1405180	1422180	If you go to Palmyra or Edessa or any of these other places where Christianity also took off, these are also syncretic areas where you'll find all sorts of amalgams between those different cultural, the cultural hardware that was available at the time.
1422180	1438180	And Christianity, as it took off in other directions, like say Nestorianism or Manichaeanism, highly syncretic. These are traditions of Christianity that ventured out into the East and flourished there and whatnot.
1439180	1461180	And those are highly syncretic that are hybrid with traditions in those directions, like for instance Buddhism. If you go to Manichaeanism, it's got Buddhist ideas in it, it's got Indic ideas in it, it's got Persian ideas into it in it and Parthian and so forth.
1461180	1471180	And so you've got the tradition that's going toward Rome, that's the one that we have mostly preserved, at least in evidence in our New Testament.
1472180	1480180	And lo and behold, it is syncretic toward the classical Greco-Roman forms and the Roman Hellenistic period.
1480180	1489180	And so that's the bedrock underneath this and those are the hardware on which this software is being ran, so to speak.
1490180	1503180	If you want to look at that as an analogy, the New Testament, the earliest Christian cult that's preserved in that trajectory toward Rome, that software that's running on the classical Mediterranean hardware at the time.
1504180	1509180	People that were in Corinth, were they deeply steeped in Judaism? No.
1510180	1520180	Even when you, I brought this up in a separate interview, but when you look at the first major successful gospel, we want to call it that, Mark.
1521180	1528180	If you dig in there, the Jews are mentioned in the third person and they're criticized throughout the text in so many ways, right?
1528180	1539180	And this is not a flattering for a picture of Judaism at the time, for the most part. It's a fairly scathing critique across it in many ways.
1540180	1545180	Even Matthew gets sort of labeled as the most Jewish of all.
1546180	1549180	Even Matthew was kind of picking on the Jews a little bit.
1550180	1554180	And you also have Magi following a star, right?
1554180	1562180	That's not Jewish. So even the most Jewish gospel of all has some problems with it.
1563180	1565180	And then you look at like, what are the Jews saying about Christianity?
1566180	1568180	They're going to read some of these mission attacks.
1569180	1572180	They're not very friendly towards the Christians either.
1573180	1576180	So the evidence you show is they're friction there.
1577180	1579180	They're not overlapping and they're not friendly with each other.
1580180	1583180	They don't even consider the Christians as fellow Jews, I don't think.
1584180	1593180	Right. Now, obviously we would see Paul as coming out of Judaism and other really cult leaders and founders and stuff in some way.
1594180	1603180	But also early on, you see a lot of others that are jumping in and some of the writers, even in the New Testament, who's Luke?
1604180	1608180	Is that a devout Jew from Jerusalem?
1608180	1611180	Well, I don't think so. And I don't think Mark was either.
1612180	1614180	It was a traveling companion that jumped in later.
1615180	1625180	Again, he describes them in the third person and then has to explain Judaism in these glosses throughout the text.
1626180	1633180	He stops at one point and he says, oh, and by the way, the Jews, when they eat, they need to wash their pots and pans
1633180	1642180	and make sure and follow their purity practice because that's what they, you know, and he's giving this, you don't have to describe that to Jewish people.
1643180	1645180	And that borders on an insult to them.
1646180	1650180	If this is a text primarily targeting Jewish people, that's absurd.
1651180	1658180	Like I said on Derek's channel, that would be like trying to describe a football to professional football players.
1658180	1660180	Like it's a ridiculous thing.
1661180	1677180	It seems like, but I think we do have to mention that they are obviously drawing from Old Testament narratives and they're sort of making Jesus fulfill a lot of the stuff happening throughout, not just the Torah, but like even the prophets and stuff in Isaiah.
1678180	1685180	And they're taking all these themes from Isaiah and from Zechariah and from Moses and the story of Moses and Abraham.
1685180	1686180	And they're sort of putting it on the Jesus.
1687180	1689180	But that comes through the Septuagint, if I'm not mistaken.
1690180	1693180	There's no evidence that they're really using anything from the Hebrew side.
1694180	1698180	It's almost like it seems like they're pretty much just drawing from the Septuagint, which is a Greek text.
1699180	1700180	Yeah, yeah.
1701180	1707180	And I would go even further than that because they're spoon feeding that to their readers as if the readers weren't really steeped in it.
1708180	1718180	And, you know, they have to like lead them into these texts, into these kind of interpretations that they're giving, which we can get into just how valid those interpretations are.
1719180	1723180	Like the messianism that's in the New Testament, largely not embraced.
1724180	1729180	A lot of those concepts are not embraced in Judaism, but that's the way that they want to draw it up.
1730180	1731180	That's the form within the cult.
1731180	1741180	And this is the way it's being fed to early converts out in the Far Flung Empire in places like Corinth and Ephesus, highly Hellenistic cities.
1742180	1744180	Hellenism was rampant in these cities.
1745180	1757180	And these were the, it's almost like in New Testament studies, it's supposed that the early converts were dropped in from some unimaginably alien place.
1758180	1766180	And we're just finding all of this completely, you know, befuddling, you know, like, what are all these people doing?
1767180	1770180	No, they had been swimming in this for generations.
1771180	1772180	These were the people that lived in these cities.
1773180	1776180	And Hellenism was, that was the way of it.
1777180	1782180	And so it wasn't, it wasn't a decision, it wasn't Jewish or Hellenism.
1782180	1788180	It was, Jews were variously also dedicated to Hellenism.
1789180	1791180	So it wasn't God of me.
1792180	1801180	Let me jump in on that for a second, because I think a good example that gives us a big picture of what some of these more Hellenized Jews were thinking is Philo.
1802180	1804180	Philo of Alexandria.
1805180	1811180	And he explicitly says, all right, so this is the, this works.
1812180	1817180	Now, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to admit, I'm going to tweak one of the words he has here.
1817180	1819180	I think I would translate it differently.
1819180	1820180	And he uses the word logos.
1820180	1821180	He transits it as reason.
1822180	1827180	But I'm going to change the logos because I think it, I want people to hear it for what it sounds like in the Greek.
1828180	1829180	It's called, it's Philo.
1829180	1830180	It's called on creation.
1830180	1834180	And people want to look this up on creation X 36.
1835180	1837180	He says the incorporeal world.
1837180	1838180	This is very Platonist.
1838180	1843180	When you hear that incorporeal, incorporeal, this is all, Plato loves these types of language, by the way.
1844180	1849180	So already, when you hear the word incorporeal, you're like, okay, Plato thinking of Platonism.
1849180	1861180	Incorporeal world was already completed having its seat in the divine logos and the world perceptible by the external senses was made on the model of it.
1862180	1871180	And the first portion of it being also the most excellent of all made by the creator was the heaven, which he truly called the firmament.
1872180	1885180	As being corporal for the body is by nature firm in so much that it's divisible into three parts and whatever the other idea of solidity and the body can there be except that it is something which may be measured in every direction.
1885180	1898180	Therefore, he very naturally contrasting that was perceptible to the external senses in the corporal with that which was perceptible by the intellect and the incorporeal calls this the firmament.
1899180	1906180	Now, if you read that, if there wait, he says divine reason, which it's correct reason logos.
1906180	1908180	I guess you can say that.
1908180	1910180	But I would have kept the word logos.
1910180	1918180	Because now all of a sudden, you're like, wait, the gods creating the world incorporeal and incorporeal through his logos.
1918180	1919180	That's what it sounds like.
1919180	1924180	It almost sounds like maybe John might be drawing from this or something similar.
1924180	1930180	Maybe if it's not phylo, maybe this idea is floating around in the world and in the Hellenized Jewish world.
1930180	1933180	And this is very plateness, by the way, incorporeal, incorporeal.
1933180	1940180	By the way, there's another passage in here where he says the three parts are incorporeal, corporal and spiritual.
1940180	1946180	And you're like, that has so much Trinitarian stuff floating around in that sentence.
1946180	1955180	Because like corporal, which is the corporal, which is flesh, incorporeal, the father and then spiritual Holy Spirit.
1955180	1958180	Like you're like, what is this where this Trinity comes from?
1958180	1960180	I'm just like throwing ideas out there.
1960180	1961180	I could be wrong.
1961180	1962180	I don't know.
1962180	1970180	But the reason why I wanted to bring this part up is because here's a prime example of a Jewish philosopher who's completely Jewish to the core.
1970180	1971180	No doubt about it.
1971180	1972180	He loves Moses.
1972180	1973180	He loves the laws.
1973180	1974180	He loves Abraham.
1974180	1975180	Read phylo.
1975180	1976180	It's Jewish.
1976180	1980180	He's not a pagan or whatever, pagan or whatever you want to call it.
1980180	1982180	But he's also very Platonist.
1982180	1983180	He loves Plato.
1983180	1987180	He says Plato is divinely inspired in this book.
1987180	1990180	So this is a prime example.
1990180	2003180	Somebody living in Alexandria, who's writing in Greek, who's relating Jewish ideas, but through the Hellenistic philosophy lens of middle Platonism and Stoicism.
2003180	2006180	Well, that's exactly what you described it to a T.
2006180	2008180	That's exactly what's going on there.
2008180	2018180	He's creating a fashionable kind of rendition of revamping Judaism in some ways within the structures of the philosophical world at that time.
2018180	2029180	Presenting himself as a sort of Jewish philosopher that's on the par with or at least could have respectability within that context.
2029180	2042180	Alexandria was was a major center, you know, rival Athens in terms of its philosophical schools and sophistication and reputation and Judaism.
2042180	2054180	In that context, there were different forms, obviously, but he represents in some ways the height of that in at least in terms of one writer that survives from that time, one thinker.
2054180	2073180	And yeah, he is bringing forward his place drawing on the classical philosophical tradition and in many ways showing his religion to be sophisticated and and and able to be conveyed through that lens as you described it.
2073180	2078180	The the Demiurgos, the Timaeus and Plato's Timaeus.
2078180	2087180	Firstly, one thing that's missing is, you know, maybe we need to take all of Plato's works and just blew them onto the bottom of our, our new testum or something like that.
2087180	2089180	Just so everyone knows.
2089180	2102180	I've been saying that significant and important and and defining those works were to the psyche and the intellectual, the kind of the top thinkers of that time.
2103180	2110180	I'm actually surprised that New Testament seminarians don't have to replay though or Greek at all.
2110180	2113180	That you think this would be mandatory.
2113180	2122180	I mean, it's like, it's like, imagine trying to understand economics and not doing math.
2122180	2123180	Right.
2123180	2125180	Exactly. Exactly.
2125180	2130180	Exactly. You know, it's not not even just Plato, but all of them.
2130180	2137180	I mean, if you go over to it, you should, they should also glue Homer to the bottom of everyone's duty.
2137180	2141180	Every every convert to this religion knew the works of Homer.
2141180	2152180	They might not have known it, you know, verbatim as a memorized text, but they were steeped in it and they were immersed in this, just like you spoke of Star Wars earlier.
2153180	2157180	This, this was so much more important to them than our Star Wars.
2157180	2171180	And, and so the idea that we're not studying the literary world of the ancient mind that the earliest converts that were coming into this, how were they thinking when they, when they came into this religion?
2171180	2179180	It's almost like it's thought that, that somebody just erased the entire hard drive and, you know, put Christianity on there.
2179180	2181180	And that's just not how human beings work.
2181180	2183180	It's not how any culture works.
2183180	2186180	Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's not realistic.
2186180	2190180	And so Euripides would be another one that is just towering canonical.
2190180	2200180	He see it. Another one towering canonical set of texts that come from his, his, his works there, works in days and theogony.
2200180	2206180	Those should all be required reading for anyone that claims to be delving into.
2207180	2214180	Especially theology as a, if you're, if you're, if you're a theology degree, PhD in theology, you should have to know this stuff.
2214180	2216180	I think, just me, just personally.
2216180	2223180	I think it's like very, I don't think I'm asking too much because theology is a Greek word that comes from the Platonist.
2223180	2225180	The first theologian was Orpheus.
2225180	2227180	He was called Orpheus the theologian.
2227180	2231180	And he, by the way, he was also called an apocalypse, a revealer.
2231180	2237180	So you have all this terminology that you get in Christianity coming from the Orphic Platonist world.
2237180	2241180	And like you, how many people who had PhDs in theology don't even know that.
2241180	2243180	Don't even know what your degree means.
2250180	2251180	No, it is, it's absurd.
2251180	2253180	You kind of wonder, what are they studying?
2253180	2257180	You know, I brought this up, I brought this up many times, actually.
2257180	2266180	That's part of the whole reason it's the, the, the, the discursive constraints is one, I've got a section in the book where I explore that.
2266180	2275180	And that's part of the scandal of this whole field really is the, the arbitrary lines and walls that have been built up.
2275180	2283180	They're relics, they're, they're leftovers from a Christian medieval scholastic kind of world that dominated.
2283180	2293180	That's where we get our whole Western academic kind of structure is out of that world in some ways, the modern discourse in New Testament studies.
2293180	2307180	I hate to say it, but it really is almost the last holdout of the dark ages in some ways in terms of trying to investigate these things with the kind of rigor that we would place on any other subject matter.
2308180	2313180	Secular academics have not been governing this discourse.
2313180	2315180	We're not defining it.
2315180	2325180	We are not in control of kind of the, the primary description of, of, of what early Christianity was and how it got off the ground.
2325180	2333180	We are, we are at best marginal voices that are drawn into question often for, it's almost suspicious.
2333180	2337180	We're seeing it as we must be up to something, you know, we must.
2337180	2346180	I've heard classes when I bring up New Testament studies and they just go, whatever, like, all right, let's talk about it.
2347180	2356180	It's like, it's like something, I don't know, I'm not going to be rude, but anyways, there's some brilliant New Testament scholars out there.
2356180	2359180	So I don't want to make it sound like I'm like, stop, like I'm better than anybody.
2359180	2360180	I'm not, I'm just some random guy.
2360180	2362180	I'm just pointing out what I'm noticing.
2362180	2363180	Okay.
2363180	2365180	But this is some of the stuff that frustrates me.
2365180	2370180	And you mentioned there's these dogmas that are very present in biblical stuff, scholarship.
2370180	2380180	And one of those is like this like allergic knee jerk reaction to anybody trying to draw from the outside to them.
2380180	2383180	It's outside the broader Mediterranean world.
2383180	2392180	And then like, for example, Dennis McDonald, I can't tell you how many times I've heard people say Dennis McDonald is Parallelomania.
2392180	2397180	And I'll say, Oh, so which, which, which of his books did you read?
2397180	2398180	Well, I didn't read it.
2398180	2399180	I just heard that.
2399180	2403180	I can't tell you how many times I've heard people say this, I'm not going to drop names here.
2403180	2407180	But I'm, but people, some of these people listening right now are going to know that I'm talking about them.
2407180	2411180	Because I've had these conversations with them and said, Dennis McDonald's Parallelomania.
2411180	2412180	Oh, really?
2412180	2420180	So you know, Greek, you read Homer, you've read Hesiod, you've read Aripides, you've read, you've read Aeschylus, and you've read Dennis's books.
2420180	2424180	And now you, what's your, let me hear why Dennis, well, I haven't even read any of that stuff.
2424180	2426180	I just, this is just what I've heard.
2426180	2427180	Yeah.
2427180	2428180	But why would you even say that?
2428180	2430180	Just say you don't even, you don't know if Dennis is correct.
2430180	2431180	I have to look into it.
2431180	2432180	Wouldn't that be the correct thing to do?
2432180	2435180	Wouldn't that be the rigorous, honest thing to say?
2435180	2440180	Hey, I heard Dennis, Dennis, Dennis's book goes a little far, but me personally, I don't know Homer.
2440180	2443180	I don't know, uh, uh, uh, Euripides, Bacchae.
2443180	2444180	I don't even know Greek.
2444180	2446180	So I'm not going to weigh in on that.
2446180	2447180	I'm just going to, I'm just telling you what I heard.
2447180	2449180	I'm like, okay, I respect that answer.
2449180	2453180	But the first thing he said was it's Parallelomania.
2453180	2455180	Christianity is a niche religion, man.
2455180	2456180	That's what they said.
2456180	2457180	That's what he said.
2457180	2462180	And I've heard, it's not just, this is, I've heard this from like five different New Testament scholars that I've talked to.
2462180	2472180	They're saying Dennis is, eh, now I'm not saying Dennis is like omniscient and everyone needs to like bow to his work and like know his stuff.
2472180	2475180	But I am saying like at least know the material that is coming from.
2475180	2484180	And he points out, some of the stuff that he points out that's indisputable in my opinion is the practice of you training people to learn Greek by copying Homer in Euripides.
2484180	2497180	So he points out, look, the people who wrote the Gospels most likely better, better chance than not have were trained in learning the classics like Homer in Euripides.
2497180	2499180	That's right.
2499180	2500180	That's right.
2500180	2503180	It's, it's for lack of training in that field.
2503180	2510180	It's mostly people having, well, they, so how do people even get jobs in this field?
2510180	2517180	You could look back up the whole thing and think, okay, is it, is it because they're skilled at deconstructing the Christian religion?
2517180	2521180	Is that, is that how you become successful in this field?
2521180	2532180	And no, it's, it's in service to largely the academic world that we call New Testament studies is in service to Western sacred history.
2532180	2534180	They're custodians of that.
2534180	2536180	They're custodians of that in so many ways.
2536180	2544180	And so, and I, and I say them because I don't want to even, I, I, I pride myself on my electoral honesty.
2544180	2553180	And you really do have to go back and study all that to even draw a conclusion that's worth listening to.
2553180	2561180	You'd have to go back and actually take a deep immersive study of the canonicity of Homer in antiquity.
2561180	2567180	Would you just how important mimesis was in the writing policies of the time?
2567180	2573180	This was standard for people to, to imitate Homer in their narratives was standard.
2573180	2582180	This wasn't just, this isn't just make Dennis McDonald off on the side, having some kind of whack theory.
2582180	2591180	This is as the result of an entire field, neglecting the literary world of antiquity.
2591180	2592180	Yeah.
2592180	2601180	And John, the way John is written, the way John is written is like, I don't know how you can't come away with it as a tragedy.
2601180	2602180	Right.
2602180	2609180	The way it's written, the way the characters are presented, the secrets of events, all the stuff that lines up with other tragedies.
2609180	2614180	And so does John, it should fit, it's like, just like any other tragedy does.
2614180	2617180	You could almost take, I mean, here's one way to look at it.
2617180	2621180	You could almost take, if you were to say, let's, let's, let's take a project here.
2621180	2632180	You were to take, say the Elijah, Elisha cycle in classical Hebrew tradition, those stories of, you know, the healings and going about in the axe head and all that stuff.
2632180	2638180	Here to take that, just the kind of episodic vignettes that are in that.
2638180	2643180	And say, put in a bowl and mix that with Homer.
2643180	2647180	Just mix all that together into one kind of combo.
2647180	2652180	You would get something that is in pretty close proximity to the Gospels.
2652180	2653180	Right.
2653180	2663180	If you got to that point now, I'm not saying that explains the entire thing, but just that ought to be telling all in its own right, you know, that you've got, and you're right.
2663180	2671180	No one is that very, very few in our field that sat down with Dennis's work and actually read what he's, he's written there.
2671180	2672180	It's compelling there.
2672180	2673180	You can't.
2673180	2675180	I think he's too careful.
2675180	2678180	I like me personally, I would go farther than he goes.
2678180	2687180	He's very careful on things that he presents as what you would say speculation or his, his hypotheses.
2687180	2690180	He's not just throwing out stuff at the wall with sticks.
2690180	2697180	We and him have talked on the phone and I would say, but what about this passage that like sounds like this or whatever?
2697180	2699180	And he'll go, I think you're being too speculative.
2699180	2704180	He's, he's way careful or more careful than people give him credit for.
2704180	2705180	He really is.
2705180	2706180	It's true.
2706180	2707180	It's true.
2707180	2713180	Now I did my PhD under him and he's a fantastic mentor and he guided me in a wonderful way.
2713180	2715180	And he's still somebody that guides me.
2715180	2717180	I still have breakfast with him frequently.
2717180	2722180	We live in the same community here and in the greater LA area and Claremont near the colleges here.
2722180	2725180	And I have a lot of wonderful conversations with him.
2725180	2738180	He is one of those people that has made a profound and really fundamental radical contribution to this field that goes still undiscovered.
2738180	2741180	And it's mostly because of these dynamics.
2741180	2742180	Paganism.
2742180	2743180	What is Paganism?
2743180	2745180	Why are we even using that term at this point?
2745180	2748180	It's an acronym for earliest Christianity.
2748180	2754180	No one was talking about the earliest Christians as Pagans at that time or outside of the early Christians being Pagans at that time.
2754180	2762180	It's, it should never be used in an academic setting and any more than the Hick or any other derogatory word, the N word.
2762180	2771180	You know, I don't mean to bring that into this, but it's a nasty word that's meant to create a version.
2771180	2788180	And it, and it re, it re-inscribes the myth of the evolution of Western sacred history that we evolved out of this like orgy of madness because Christianity came on the scene.
2788180	2789180	Right.
2789180	2791180	Which is so false.
2791180	2793180	Right.
2794180	2796180	You're so right though.
2796180	2813180	That's the impression you get from a lot of people in the New Testament studies realm is that there's the Greek Pagan world and they're all doing worshipping idols and, you know, sacrificing goats and just, just ignore what happens in the Old Testament.
2813180	2814180	Forget about that stuff.
2814180	2817180	It's just, it's only them doing, right?
2817180	2819180	And then, but then they go even farther.
2819180	2835180	And it's like, there, there's a separate border across the Pagans and these pious Christians that were, there were, these poor people were, were persecuted by these, these Romans that were, you know, worshipping Caesar.
2835180	2839180	And it's like, it's way more, it's simplifying.
2839180	2842180	It's so much that it sounds like a fairy tale.
2842180	2843180	Right.
2843180	2848180	And when you use that word Pagan, you're already, what you're doing is you just jumped into a dogma.
2848180	2858180	And now it's, as soon as you use that word to describe the other, you, what you've done is you've limited yourself to understand the broader Mediterranean world.
2858180	2864180	And you, now you're operating within a dogma that was created by the church in later times.
2864180	2870180	So you're, you're all, without even realizing it, you're now operating within the dogmas of the church.
2870180	2872180	Even if you don't even want to, you are.
2873180	2874180	Right, right.
2874180	2877180	And that's, I mean, this, this happens elsewhere as well.
2877180	2892180	I mean, you can go into, you know, who were the barbarians, you know, like the, the, the, the, the victor rarely gets to paint the, I mean, the, the, the, the, the vanquished rarely get to paint the picture of their own history.
2892180	2894180	Right. It's, it's written by others.
2894180	2900180	And strangely enough, you can go back the evidence, the literary evidence for the Roman world is giant.
2900180	2902180	You go back and read some of these people.
2902180	2903180	Brilliant.
2903180	2905180	Go read Cicero.
2905180	2909180	You know, go read a virtual, go read any of these individuals.
2909180	2913180	Not one of them should be given the indignity of being referred to as a pagan.
2913180	2923180	Especially when you read Cicero's On the Nature of the Gods, the dialogue he has, he has a stoic dialogue with a priest and a somewhat Platonist or something.
2923180	2929180	And they're, they're going, it's like a very, you could, this book is so important to me because it highlights in the first century,
2929180	2935180	BC, it highlights that this conversation was being had about superstition.
2935180	2944180	And Christianity is, gets credited for being the sort of step up from being superstitious, even though it's very superstitious too.
2944180	2947180	Hope still comes out in January.
2947180	2951180	And he checks this like, gel or goo.
2951180	2955180	And if it's solid, it means it's going to be bad omens.
2955180	2957180	And if it's, if it's liquid, it's a good omen.
2957180	2958180	Did you know about this?
2958180	2961180	This still happens, this just happened in 2024 in January.
2961180	2963180	Oh my goodness.
2963180	2968180	So the idea that they're not superstitious, but anyways, that's a, that's another top.
2968180	2974180	But they, Christianity gets credited as being like, we're not as superstitious as these other pagans are.
2974180	2981180	And it's almost like, but that movement started before Christianity even was on anyone's tongue.
2981180	2983180	Read Cicero.
2983180	2986180	Read, even before, let's go back even farther.
2986180	2996180	This, the, the pre-Socratics, Heraclitus, in one of his fragments, Heraclitus has said, these people are worshiping idols and talking to them like they're real.
2996180	2998180	You don't know anything about the gods.
2998180	3002180	So there's that, that, that, that boat already sailed.
3002180	3012180	That movement of like, looking, looking past superstitions and being more prop, being more pragmatic about, about the divine.
3012180	3017180	That already, that's already a thing that's been 500 years in the making.
3017180	3018180	Right.
3018180	3020180	In some ways you could look at Christianity.
3020180	3023180	I mean, it's, you could, there's nothing really new about Christianity.
3023180	3027180	It's, it's just, it's, it's new in its configuration.
3027180	3031180	It's new and it's in that way that it's kind of like the automobile.
3031180	3035180	We had entrance, we had doors, we had windows, we had steering wheels.
3035180	3037180	We had all that stuff.
3037180	3039180	And now it comes together a certain way.
3039180	3042180	Not that Christianity was this great invention or anything.
3042180	3044180	It's its own odd jumble of goods.
3044180	3048180	But no, these weren't, this wasn't a new innovation.
3048180	3053180	In fact, when it came onto the scene, it was considered a pernicious superstition.
3053180	3056180	That's, that's how, that was the natural reaction.
3056180	3057180	It was looking at it.
3057180	3058180	Yeah.
3058180	3059180	Yeah.
3059180	3060180	Yeah.
3060180	3066180	And so dangerous, deadly even, I think in, in Tacitus, he refers to as a deadly superstition.
3066180	3067180	Right.
3067180	3072180	Which is so, which is so funny how they credit themselves as being the, the religion that
3072180	3074180	got us away from all those superstitious pagans.
3074180	3079180	But like, you read, you read the contemporary sources of the time period and they're the
3079180	3081180	ones getting called that.
3081180	3084180	So there's obviously, it's obviously way more complicated than that.
3084180	3089180	And it's presented like in this very fairy tale like manner is that this, this Christianity
3089180	3095180	religion against all odds was, you know, came up in the, and just miraculously became the
3095180	3099180	religion of the entire, you know, Roman society.
3099180	3102180	But like, you can see it's way more complicated than that.
3102180	3104180	And there's way more moving parts happening.
3104180	3108180	And there's, there's, there's Platonism and middle Platonism and philosophy involved behind
3108180	3113180	the scenes and a lot of these different early Christian sex, like the so-called Gnostics.
3113180	3118180	When you read their texts, it's very, it's very, they're like, they're, they're, they're,
3118180	3124180	some of these sex, the, for example, the Carpacrations, they had images of Plato and
3124180	3125180	Cyrus next to Jesus.
3125180	3132180	So you're seeing like all these different movements coming out of philosophical traditions influencing
3132180	3133180	theology.
3133180	3138180	So what I'm noticing is as philosophy progresses, theology follows behind it.
3138180	3140180	That's what it seems like is going on.
3140180	3141180	Yeah.
3141180	3142180	Yeah.
3142180	3144180	Your thoughts on that.
3144180	3148180	Well, I think that part of it is just the way people think.
3148180	3150180	And so what, what are people doing?
3150180	3152180	I mean, you're, we're talking about the discourse at this point.
3152180	3154180	Like why, why isn't this being talked about?
3154180	3157180	Why isn't this the in-depth exploration?
3157180	3164180	The, the, why isn't this the all-consuming or primarily consuming project for New Testament
3164180	3165180	work?
3165180	3169180	Why is, what, well, why are people, what is the New Testament in the mind and psyche of
3169180	3171180	our culture at this time?
3171180	3173180	It is a bridge, a possible bridge.
3173180	3178180	It presents a hope that possibly something beyond the natural exists, some, some kind
3178180	3184180	of extra thing that maybe we can survive death, maybe, and, and so people are looking to this
3184180	3186180	religion in that way.
3186180	3189180	And so it's theologically tethered.
3189180	3194180	And so the discussion in that way, you know, exploring, it's a lot of work.
3194180	3199180	You want to, you know, if you had to as a New Testament, and this is kind of what I had
3199180	3200180	to do.
3200180	3202180	My, my work was transdisciplinary.
3202180	3207180	I did like three master's degree programs and I had to study classics and I took all
3207180	3212180	sorts of classics courses under classics, secular professors all over the place.
3212180	3217180	And as you'll see there, my, my book was basically a reworking of my dissertation.
3217180	3222180	I had three of my four dissertation committee members were classicists.
3222180	3227180	They, you know, they could care less about the New Testament in so many ways.
3227180	3234180	And so that's hard to get into their world and to become impressive in their world in
3234180	3239180	terms of understanding, getting to a point where you can truly understand the classical
3239180	3241180	Mediterranean world.
3241180	3248180	And all of its, I mean, in some ways Judaism is, is by comparison, appears at least from
3248180	3256180	my standpoint, like a tide pool compared sitting next to this vast sea that you have to learn
3256180	3262180	and master and become immersed in in order to even feel like you understand what you're
3262180	3263180	doing in that world.
3263180	3270180	And so the more and more we do that, of course, the scandal is, is that it's not even like
3270180	3274180	you would think people would put the flippers on and go swimming in that sea occasionally
3274180	3276180	and at least make an effort.
3276180	3277180	Right.
3277180	3284180	And like I was talking to Derek the other day about Corinthians, first and second Corinthians.
3284180	3290180	Well, Cassanius goes there and he walks around and looks at Corin and gives a vivid description
3290180	3291180	of that.
3291180	3297180	I mean, flaxes at seminaries on the Corinthian correspondences.
3297180	3301180	Cassanius, I don't even think was mentioned.
3301180	3302180	Right.
3302180	3303180	Not even mentioned.
3303180	3305180	Like what were we doing?
3305180	3309180	I look back and I think what were we even talking about?
3309180	3310180	Like,
3310180	3314180	And by the way, he's a second century geographer.
3314180	3315180	Right.
3315180	3318180	See, that's a perfect source.
3318180	3319180	Exactly.
3319180	3325180	There's your archaeology for the ancient world, like from, from the sources standpoint, like
3325180	3327180	you, you're right.
3327180	3333180	He's walking around in the world that Christianity is growing in, at least middle second century
3333180	3334180	time.
3334180	3335180	He goes to Corinth.
3335180	3337180	He goes to all these different ethicists.
3337180	3338180	Right.
3338180	3339180	I'm pretty sure he went to ethicists.
3339180	3343180	But he's going all around the place and he's describing what's going on here.
3343180	3348180	By the way, speaking of Pausanius, Pausanius goes to a city.
3348180	3349180	I forgot where it is.
3349180	3354180	It's somewhere in central Greece where they have a temple of Dionysus.
3354180	3363180	And on the 5th of January, they take three jars of three empty jars and they leave them
3363180	3364180	out in the sanctuary.
3364180	3368180	And then the morning when they come in, they're filled with wine miraculously.
3368180	3372180	Get this, early Orthodox church.
3372180	3376180	This is, this is, I put this in one of my recent videos and I'm still wondering why this isn't
3376180	3377180	talked about.
3377180	3381180	There are, there are some scholars that wrote about this and they're in the classics world,
3381180	3382180	believe it or not.
3382180	3391180	But this is the early church, Orthodox church credits January 6th, the same day as the Epiphany
3391180	3397180	and the same day as the Magi gets celebrated on and his birthday to some, you know how
3397180	3401180	some Orthodoxy celebrates Christmas on January 6th.
3401180	3405180	But they also say this is the same day of the wedding at Cana.
3406180	3407180	Do you know this?
3407180	3408180	No.
3408180	3415180	And this is, Pausanias talks about this, this, this, this right that they perform where there's
3415180	3417180	a miracle every year.
3417180	3424180	And plainly younger, two second century sources that mentioned this particular festival of
3424180	3425180	Dionysus.
3425180	3429180	And you have, you have the wedding at Cana.
3429180	3431180	And that's just one example.
3431180	3437180	We talked about how in resurrections and Plutarch writes about this at length.
3437180	3439180	You and I were talking about this recently.
3439180	3445180	Plutarch starts naming off people who I haven't even heard of who supposedly died and their
3445180	3449180	bodies disappeared and they were assumed divinity because of this.
3449180	3450180	Yes.
3450180	3451180	What happens to Jesus?
3451180	3457180	He died, he gets put in a tomb and he disappears and he's assumed divine.
3457180	3460180	That's a, that's a Mediterranean motif in general.
3460180	3464180	Like that's, we're talking about the resurrection itself.
3464180	3470180	I just recently heard, I just recently heard, and I love this, this scholar, Dan McClellan.
3470180	3472180	I love Dan McClellan.
3472180	3477180	But whenever he, whenever he gets into like Greek influence on Christianity, he just rejects
3477180	3478180	it all outright.
3478180	3481180	He just, it's like he's allergic to it.
3481180	3487180	And I heard him just recently say this, there, you know, yeah, some of the stuff, some of
3487180	3492180	the Greek stuff that the Christians are modeling and using to write their texts, but it has
3492180	3496180	no, no influence on the Christian story or Christian tradition whatsoever.
3496180	3502180	And I'm just thinking the resurrection, the way the resurrection is described is a Hellenistic
3502180	3504180	motif that's all across the board.
3504180	3505180	Romulus.
3505180	3506180	Yeah.
3506180	3507180	Yeah.
3507180	3510180	Well, I've not read my book.
3510180	3515180	That's, yeah, that's the, if there isn't, that's the whole point and thrust of my book
3515180	3518180	is to lay that out in vivid detail.
3518180	3522180	The, that that, in fact, the earliest Christians admit as much.
3522180	3527180	That's their, they say this is what, and they interpret and receive that story in that way.
3527180	3529180	That's why it's resurrection and reception.
3529180	3535180	The, the reception of that story, the continuity, you could draw a through line from antiquity
3535180	3541180	straight through Christianity into its later forms and see just how it evolves straight
3541180	3542180	through that.
3542180	3545180	It's an anthropological kind of project.
3545180	3548180	New Testament scholars don't take anthropology.
3548180	3550180	They don't even know what it is.
3550180	3551180	No.
3551180	3552180	They have no idea where that is.
3552180	3554180	And this is the sad part.
3554180	3559180	Early Christians are willing to talk about that stuff more than scholars today.
3559180	3566180	Justin Marder, comparing Jesus to Hercules and Mithras and Dionysus and, and Mercury.
3566180	3570180	He's compared, he's throwing all these comparisons out there because he's trying to like talk to
3570180	3576180	his fellow Platonists that are, you know, that he wants to like, yeah, we're just like you guys.
3576180	3577180	You can take.
3577180	3581180	Now, Clement, Clement, Clement of Alexandria does this in his protracticus.
3581180	3584180	You have, what's his name?
3584180	3585180	Shit.
3585180	3586180	Epiphanius.
3586180	3589180	Epiphanius in the fifth century, when he writes the Panarion.
3589180	3596180	He's talking about gods that are being celebrated as their birthday at the Winter Solstice.
3596180	3597180	Right.
3597180	3598180	Jesus.
3598180	3603180	Like, well, how come early Christians are willing to go and do this type of comparison?
3603180	3609180	But scholars today who call themselves critical scholars won't want, don't want to go there.
3609180	3610180	Right.
3610180	3611180	Justin Marder.
3611180	3614180	I mean, that's how, that's why I kick off my book with him is because he's going there
3614180	3615180	in spades.
3615180	3617180	He's, that's his, his, he predicate.
3617180	3619180	In fact, he can't avoid that.
3619180	3623180	Any argument outside of that wouldn't have gotten gone anywhere at that in that world.
3623180	3629180	So he's having to go ahead and get honest about that this is the bedrock upon which the resurrection
3629180	3633180	story and so forth is today, there was a move.
3633180	3639180	Like if you go back a hundred years, a century, there was there, the scholarship was at least
3639180	3649180	in its best forms, moving pretty heavily into the, the classical Greek, Roman, Hellenistic
3649180	3656180	society at that time to contextualize earliest Christian thought and texts.
3656180	3658180	And so we see some of that.
3658180	3660180	And we talked about Arthur Darby.
3660180	3667180	He was about a century ago, exactly right now, actually, when he got his career going.
3667180	3669180	He's a marvelous example of that.
3669180	3675180	But what you see is that get pushed up the academic tower.
3675180	3682180	And so you see in the elite schools, like I want to, Professor Johnny Otis is one of the people that
3682180	3688180	endorses my book on the back, teaches at the advanced, the Center for Advanced Study at Princeton
3688180	3691180	University and the same place Einstein taught.
3691180	3695180	That's, that's about as ivory tower as you can get.
3695180	3698180	I mean, yeah, it's by invite only and you get to study there.
3698180	3704180	If you've already earned your PhD and they'll invite you and they invite a couple of people a year.
3704180	3706180	And that's it or every now and then.
3706180	3709180	And so Bowersock was one of them.
3709180	3711180	You might have heard of that, that name in the past.
3711180	3716180	Another highly ivory tower type scholar that's super elite.
3716180	3720180	So this conversation has been happening at that, at that higher level.
3720180	3725180	Harvard, some of these places, University of Chicago, Cambridge University.
3725180	3728180	You'll see the discourse continue through.
3728180	3733180	But when you get closer to where the culture is at, like say in seminaries.
3733180	3734180	Right.
3734180	3735180	Nitty schools.
3735180	3736180	SPL.
3736180	3741180	Yeah, there's a SPL for the most part.
3741180	3747180	It's almost like a novelty to even hear from those people that are steeped in that, that
3747180	3749180	are presenting it within that.
3749180	3750180	Yeah.
3750180	3754180	But this is what I, when I, okay.
3754180	3761180	So I made a video recently about the Dionysian, not Dionysus, Jesus connections, Dionysian
3761180	3762180	connection.
3762180	3766180	I think it's a better term because I'm talking about like the culture of the Dionysus culture
3766180	3770180	and the way the, the way they run their Ecclesias.
3770180	3774180	And you know, Clappenborg's written about this as well.
3774180	3778180	And I, I was surprised because I started the video up with a joke.
3778180	3780180	The video was an introduction.
3780180	3787180	It was showing Dan McClellan refute on an online TikToker on the, you know, the Eucharist
3787180	3790180	being having any, any Dionysian influence.
3790180	3793180	And I just made a joke and I threw him in there.
3793180	3797180	And as I'm researching for this video and I'm writing my script and I'm looking for sources
3797180	3801180	from scholars, I, there's so many that I had to, I couldn't use them all.
3801180	3803180	There's so much scholarship on this subject.
3803180	3809180	And what, what, what was so weird to me is Dan, when Dan McClellan talked about it, he
3809180	3812180	was saying, there's no scholars are talking about this.
3812180	3814180	Like this is, this is nothing.
3814180	3815180	Nobody's ever written about this.
3815180	3816180	I've never heard anything like this.
3816180	3817180	This is nonsense.
3817180	3819180	The way, the way he said it.
3819180	3823180	And I just want to, I'm looking up all these academic journals throughout the, throughout
3823180	3824180	the years.
3824180	3826180	There's so much written about this.
3826180	3829180	And it was like, does he, did he just, does he just reject all this?
3829180	3831180	Or does he not know about this?
3831180	3832180	Like what's going on here?
3832180	3837180	And I just think it's, I just think it's odd when you get a scholar who's very well,
3837180	3841180	very well accredited like McClellan or Bart Ehrman.
3841180	3843180	I'm throwing out names that I'm going to get in trouble.
3843180	3845180	Oh, well, who cares?
3845180	3850180	He just, you know, you know, no offense to Bart, but like, he wrote an article and it's
3850180	3851180	still up online.
3851180	3855180	It's still not corrected where he confuses diogenes with Demetrius.
3855180	3860180	And it's like, where is, if you're not, we're not even getting names right.
3860180	3864180	I mean, you're McClellan's, McClellan pronounced semile's name, semile.
3864180	3865180	Semile.
3865180	3866180	Semile.
3866180	3867180	Wait.
3867180	3871180	So you're going to, you're going to stamp your foot down on the Dionysian aspects of Christianity.
3871180	3874180	If you don't even, but how do you not, you don't even know how to say semile.
3874180	3878180	So how, and all I'm saying is this, I love Bart Ehrman.
3878180	3879180	I love Dan McClellan.
3879180	3883180	I love all the stuff they do in New Testament, Old Testament, Hebrew stuff, all that stuff.
3883180	3886180	But like, if you just, sometimes you don't have to know everything.
3886180	3889180	If you don't know something, just say, I don't know.
3889180	3893180	Say, I've never heard anything like, I never heard the Dionysian aspects of Jesus.
3893180	3897180	It's, this is new to me, but I'm sure, you know, I'm sure there's someone who's written
3897180	3898180	about, I don't know.
3898180	3903180	But the way it was like, the way it's shot down, as if we, I know all this, don't even
3903180	3905180	look there, there's nothing to see here.
3905180	3909180	Instead of being like, I'm not aware of it.
3909180	3911180	That's all.
3911180	3913180	Well, it's a lack of training.
3913180	3916180	If you think about it, I mean, I'm also an Ehrman fan.
3916180	3919180	You know, he's got a number of insights that have been helpful.
3919180	3923180	And some, in some ways we run parallel and in certain regards, he went to Princeton
3923180	3924180	Seminary.
3924180	3926180	I did as well.
3926180	3932180	But he's purely trained within the theological kind of training.
3932180	3935180	That's your type of, type of scholarship.
3935180	3941180	This is the most conservative guy that's Bennett, Princeton Seminary, that I know of.
3941180	3943180	I met him before he passed away.
3943180	3946180	Super nice guy, but let's get on this.
3946180	3951180	That does not amount to a secular training in ancient history.
3951180	3957180	It's, it was a theological training within the Presbyterian tradition that they offer
3957180	3958180	there.
3958180	3960180	And it is, it is significant.
3960180	3965180	And you do learn a lot there, but to say that that's going to then qualify you to speak
3965180	3970180	on everything, you know, within the broader classical Mediterranean world.
3970180	3976180	I think that requires more study and not that he's not capable of that and not be even
3976180	3981180	pick on Bart, but he's, he's kind of representation of a larger phenomenology within the field
3981180	3987180	where you've got these people that are trained at the Bindi schools and at seminaries all up
3987180	3994180	and down that are at least weighing in heavily to where the, the, the central for us, the
3994180	4001180	discourse are at and what, what we're going to say is normal or mainstream or acceptable.
4001180	4009180	And so this idea of dismissing out of hand, whole categories of study.
4009180	4015180	That's not what would be going on if this were a secular, you know, if this were ran as a
4015180	4021180	secular topic and not a theological topic, but as a secular where historians and literary
4021180	4027180	scholars studying another topic within antiquity, that would not be going on at all.
4027180	4033180	And so our field is in morbid isolation from the secular humanities.
4033180	4037180	And so we don't have to, we're not playing by the same rules as the rest of the academic
4037180	4038180	world.
4038180	4043180	And I don't think we're as honest and that's not to pick on any particular person.
4043180	4047180	I had to fight my way out of that all the way out to the end of my education to get out of it
4047180	4053180	because I was trained at those same places and I had to finally for the last, you know,
4053180	4060180	last several years of my education, just, you know, leading to get, get a UCLA and all these
4060180	4064180	different places trying to get out of the Divinity schools and get into the classics departments
4064180	4068180	to learn everything I can about that ancient world.
4068180	4074180	And so I think that's, that's the problem is that you're, we're there.
4074180	4076180	Also, it's, it's a lot of work.
4076180	4079180	It deconstructs the New Testament in so many ways.
4079180	4081180	It's dangerous.
4081180	4085180	We live in a society that doesn't want all of this overturned.
4085180	4087180	This, this is the living religion.
4087180	4094180	I mean, in some ways, in some ways it's affecting like on a large scale, the war in Israel anyway,
4094180	4097180	because people who support, I'm not, I'm not going to get political right now.
4097180	4099180	I'm not, I don't want you to either.
4099180	4107180	But like, there are people who are influencing or supporting certain things happening in the world
4107180	4113180	that are very detrimental to people due to religious belief.
4113180	4116180	It's absolutely the case.
4116180	4117180	Yeah.
4117180	4119180	And people hold, this is sacred history.
4119180	4120180	It's not just history.
4120180	4122180	It's sacred history in the minds of so many people.
4122180	4123180	It's not for me.
4123180	4130180	For me, it's, it's a very interesting to, I could get as much out of reading about Apollonius of Diana as I do about
4130180	4134180	reading something out of Paul or some other place or place works.
4134180	4140180	I could sit down if I want to, you know, personal kind of satisfaction or devotional kind of moment.
4140180	4146180	I could read just about anything in the ancient world and just and find enrichment.
4146180	4150180	But for most society, I'm unique that way.
4150180	4152180	I don't see myself as normal in that.
4152180	4159180	Even though I ought to, I ought to see myself as normal in that way because it really is.
4159180	4165180	When you have people to get through seminary, they have to sign a statement of faith.
4165180	4169180	What you've done now, and this is something that still happens today in some of these seminaries,
4169180	4174180	they have to sign a statement of faith to get their certificate or degree or whatever.
4174180	4178180	And what you're doing is you're forcing them to lie no matter what.
4178180	4185180	Either they have to lie for Jesus to promote Christianity or they have to lie against the statement of faith that they just signed.
4185180	4187180	This is so horrible.
4187180	4189180	Why is this even still happening?
4189180	4194180	It's beyond my, beyond anything I can imagine.
4194180	4204180	And this is what I mean about like some of these dogmatic attitudes that we find in some of these circles of biblical scholarship are,
4204180	4210180	they do have like a major impact on the world and some of this stuff happening because of your,
4210180	4216180	your, your upholding, even if you're a critical scholar that rejects all, all miracles,
4216180	4222180	but you're willing to just, just grant all the historicity parts.
4222180	4224180	Like, yes, you see this with Bart a lot.
4224180	4228180	Like, if it says it in the story, if we can't prove it otherwise, it probably happened then.
4228180	4232180	It's kind of like, it seems like that's kind of like his, his attitude towards the text.
4232180	4234180	Joseph probably was Jesus's father.
4234180	4235180	Okay, whatever.
4235180	4240180	Like, we're like, what, I'm not saying, like, I'm not, I'm not even like saying he's wrong, but I'm saying like,
4240180	4248180	there's a lot of stuff that are assumed just to be true about the text, about the, about the cries of Christianity,
4248180	4256180	that otherwise should, you think it should be more, more rigorous approach to this stuff.
4256180	4264180	But then when it comes to like what we're talking about, when we're talking about the broader influences on this religion,
4264180	4270180	now all of a sudden the burden of proof is higher and you need more, like, it's almost like, I don't know how to explain this, right?
4270180	4279180	It's almost like certain things are accepted easily and other things are rejected and are not accepted as easy,
4279180	4284180	based on the sort of attitude of biblical scholarship itself.
4284180	4294180	And I think that goes, and a lot of the more conservative side of biblical scholarship, they sort of push that forward and it sort of gets,
4294180	4298180	and even the liberal scholar sort of kind of go along with it, it seems like.
4298180	4299180	Well, yeah.
4299180	4306180	Okay, so even the entire discourse is, is, is, is different in that regard.
4306180	4311180	I mean, this whole conservative, liberal, and then I don't know what I'm supposed to be secular or some,
4311180	4314180	we're just desparados up to the end of the discourse.
4314180	4323180	Really, I'm just practicing the, all of the tools that I've learned in the trade, in terms of classical, any kind of,
4323180	4331180	any per, anybody that's trying to investigate and describe classical antiquity in a secular kind of context, those,
4331180	4333180	that's, that's what I'm bringing to this.
4333180	4337180	I'm not trying to disturb anybody's faith necessarily, or anything like that.
4337180	4344180	But I do want to go back and give these texts the same dignity that we would afford them in any other topic, right?
4344180	4345180	Yeah.
4345180	4350180	So, and use the same, the same measuring sticks, the same tools, the same methodologies.
4350180	4356180	We don't assume Socrates said all this stuff that Plato's making him say.
4356180	4359180	We go, wait, Plato making Socrates say this?
4359180	4361180	Is this something that fits the data?
4362180	4366180	Let's compare it to what the other writer who writes about Socrates,
4366180	4370180	what we can compare them, how they present Socrates and they're different.
4370180	4373180	Like, okay, is Plato making Socrates say this?
4373180	4377180	Is he turning Socrates into this specific character?
4377180	4381180	Why isn't that same approach happening to New Testament?
4381180	4382180	Wait a minute.
4382180	4384180	Is the author making Jesus say this?
4384180	4388180	Or is this really, it seems like that's, seems like the approach on which,
4388180	4392180	how much we give credence to the story of the New Testament is a lot different
4392180	4396180	than what we, what we would do in other aspects of different texts.
4396180	4398180	Well, it's the sociology of it all.
4398180	4402180	And that's really kind of, you talk to people that are out on the end of this,
4402180	4406180	out on the edges, studying classics, and we are an odd bunch.
4406180	4409180	You know, we're kind of porcupines.
4409180	4416180	You're talking like Carrier or Litwa or, you know, Robin Faith Walsh is not a porcupine.
4416180	4420180	She's a great example of somebody that tries to get along with everyone.
4420180	4422180	But she gets much better too.
4422180	4424180	She does, she does.
4424180	4429180	And Dennis McDonald is a wonderful man that's treated people very well throughout his career,
4429180	4438180	but he gets treated horribly back by so many, even though his intellectual pedigree is hard to match.
4438180	4439180	Right.
4439180	4441180	You know, Harvard trained all the way up the board.
4441180	4446180	We're talking about somebody that's highly skilled and qualified to talk on these topics,
4446180	4448180	and yet he's pushed to the margins.
4448180	4449180	And so that's-
4449180	4453180	And the criticisms they get, the criticisms they get are not valid.
4453180	4456180	They don't actually check and read the stuff that they're talking about.
4456180	4459180	They just say, huh, I've never heard that yet.
4459180	4460180	That can't be right.
4460180	4461180	Right.
4461180	4464180	A seminary I went to, I'd never heard anything like that.
4464180	4465180	That can't be true.
4465180	4466180	That's bizarre.
4466180	4467180	That's the sort of-
4467180	4468180	Right.
4468180	4472180	That's the sort of mentality that I'm noticing when it comes to the pushback against the Robin-
4472180	4474180	Robin Faith Walsh's and Dennis McDonald's.
4474180	4476180	It's almost like there's no-
4476180	4479180	The pushback is just, uh-uh.
4479180	4480180	Well, it's fallacy.
4480180	4481180	Yeah.
4481180	4483180	The idea that I see this all the time online.
4483180	4488180	I'll see people mention some of the people that you've listed in there or more myself,
4488180	4490180	even in other contexts.
4490180	4497180	It's, um, well, that's not the mainstream view or, you know, they're very, you know,
4497180	4502180	no one, very few have embraced that theory or something like this.
4502180	4504180	As if that's a fallacy.
4504180	4506180	That's a fallacious kind of thought.
4506180	4507180	Yeah.
4507180	4508180	Yeah.
4508180	4511180	I can't tell you how many times I've heard people say, that's not the consensus.
4511180	4512180	Okay.
4512180	4517180	And is that, is that, is the consensus true?
4517180	4518180	Right.
4518180	4519180	Look at the argument.
4519180	4520180	Let's deal.
4520180	4521180	Let's look at the text.
4521180	4524180	Is this a plausible, even if you don't believe it?
4524180	4525180	Is it plausible?
4525180	4526180	Let's start there.
4526180	4527180	Right.
4527180	4531180	And the very least, Dennis McDonald and Robin Faith Wallace, the stuff they're saying,
4531180	4532180	beyond plausible.
4532180	4535180	It's absolutely plausible.
4535180	4539180	So like, you can't even say it's not plausible, even if you think it's wrong.
4539180	4541180	But they, they act like it's just like impossible.
4541180	4542180	This can't be true.
4542180	4543180	I never heard this.
4543180	4545180	I was never trained this way.
4545180	4550180	It's like, it's just be, it goes outside of the scope of, of the sort of mentality of,
4550180	4553180	of New Testament scholarship.
4553180	4555180	My work is, is even given a worse treatment in some ways.
4555180	4560180	I mean, I've had many, many, I mean, it's required reading in Harvard last time I checked.
4560180	4561180	At least it used to be.
4561180	4566180	And there are a number of places where it is taken very seriously in certain circles,
4566180	4568180	especially in the high academies.
4568180	4576180	But largely it's, it's seen as a, you know, that I must be just off out into outer space
4576180	4577180	doing my own thing.
4577180	4579180	And really what's going on there.
4579180	4584180	I mean, I've, if you, if you look at it, so I'm doing memesis criticism a lot like Dennis
4584180	4587180	in some ways, but it's cultural rather than literary.
4587180	4590180	That's my kind of methodological lens throughout the book.
4590180	4593180	And, but also what is the other thing?
4593180	4595180	It's dismantling tacitly.
4595180	4601180	Now it wasn't my aim necessarily, but it's tacitly dismantling the reason anyone's even
4601180	4605180	reading the New Testament to begin with, for the most part, and that is because of this
4605180	4608180	hope for afterlife or survival of death.
4608180	4613180	And in, in, in some ways, if you, if you, if my, if I'm correct in there all the way
4613180	4620180	across that particular perspective, and I am just, just to give you that confidence
4620180	4625180	from my side, I am correct that that, that should be, and it was the interpretation.
4625180	4629180	That's how these texts were received originally.
4629180	4635180	Then you have to concede that this was mythology or mythmaking in some way and that it was
4635180	4636180	cultic, cult for that.
4636180	4641180	They was using the same cultic raw materials that were available at that time to build
4641180	4642180	an early cult.
4642180	4647180	It wasn't, they weren't trying to create a, a this really happened kind of movement.
4647180	4652180	They were creating a cultic movement with cultic storytelling with a founder and that
4652180	4657180	was mythologized as, as Pliny says in his texts that, that they were singing hymns to
4657180	4662180	him as, as to a God, which was, you know, within that's, that's the categories that,
4663180	4665180	that, that they were able to conceive of this.
4665180	4667180	And that was the very categories that had sprung up.
4667180	4674180	And so if you think about that, that even biases and even one step further for me where
4674180	4680180	most of SPL could never accept my thesis out of hand.
4680180	4682180	They don't even, before they even open the book.
4682180	4684180	Well, you want to know what, want to know what it is.
4684180	4690180	I think when, when somebody writes a book and they put it out there and it gets accepted
4690180	4694180	and becomes part of their, it becomes a part of their identity is like, this is the, this
4694180	4699180	is their, but when you write something and it goes and it pushes up, pushes up against
4699180	4703180	some of their stuff, they, it's almost like they have to reject it.
4703180	4705180	Cause that this is my identity.
4705180	4707180	They're dealing with, they're going to, they're going to make me look like a fraud.
4707180	4708180	If he's right now, I'm wrong.
4708180	4709180	I'm a fraud.
4709180	4714180	So you have, you have a monetary, there's like monetary reasons behind it, not just monetary,
4714180	4719180	but there's, there's reasons why people automatically will shut down.
4719180	4723180	If, if you're saying something that goes against what they've been saying and they're, and they're
4723180	4726180	supposed to be the expert and you're going against that, they're going to, they're, they're
4726180	4730180	naturally going to, naturally going to try to find ways to shut it down.
4730180	4732180	You almost can't blame them.
4732180	4737180	If Dennis is right, I mean, going back to him, if he's right, that Homeric and Mimesis
4737180	4743180	and, and other Mimesis in the New Testament is rampant or even occurring at all a whole
4743180	4748180	lot, then that means that almost every commentary, pretty much every commentary that's been
4748180	4754180	written up to this point in modern academic work on the New Testament needs to be pretty
4754180	4757180	much probably thrown in the waste can.
4757180	4762180	It's, it's so far off at that point that we don't even know what we're doing.
4762180	4769180	And so, yeah, and that's for people to admit that, think about this, you go and you get
4769180	4773180	your PhD and then you come out the other end and you're presented with something that's
4773180	4777180	so far outside of anything you were trained in.
4777180	4786180	Yeah, that's what I, that's what I think is the main driving force behind the pushback
4786180	4791180	is you get people who go to school for eight to 10 years, they get a PhD in theology and
4791180	4796180	religions and then they, that whole entire time that they were in seminary and they learn
4796180	4801180	what they learned and they're, they're being trained to only look at this area right here.
4801180	4805180	Look at the density schools, look at this, look at the Septuagint, look at the Old Testament,
4805180	4808180	look at the Maserati texts and that's their world.
4808180	4813180	And then they, a couple of years down the road, you know, they write some academic articles,
4813180	4817180	they get, they get their name out there, they're, they're a real professional scholar now.
4817180	4824180	All of a sudden somebody comes along and says something completely opposite, completely different.
4824180	4828180	Imagine that, you'd be like, I've never heard anything like this, this can't be true.
4828180	4833180	Because if it's true, I would have heard it in my years of going to seminary.
4833180	4836180	Well, sorry, but that's not the way it works.
4836180	4839180	Either the data suggests, the data is there or it's not.
4839180	4844180	So we need to like start off as, as what they're saying, even plausible at first.
4844180	4847180	If it is, then you should look at it.
4847180	4853180	Right, that's what my, my whole, my, my whole theory that I ran with in book, you know,
4853180	4859180	that basically the translation fable, it's, you really have to take a fresh run at it.
4859180	4863180	I had to get to the, I got to the point when I was writing it, I started, in my mind,
4863180	4869180	I was having all of these arguments with all of the supposed leading scholars of our time.
4869180	4871180	They were New Testament folks.
4871180	4873180	And I got to the point where I was just, it was just maddening.
4873180	4876180	I just thought, you know what, that's a waste.
4876180	4878180	None of them have studied Plutar.
4878180	4880180	They don't know any of this.
4880180	4882180	They haven't studied this sufficiently.
4882180	4888180	So for me to have this long involved conversation with people that don't even know.
4888180	4889180	They're not even looking at it.
4889180	4896180	They're just assuming that if their, if their favorite scholar or their, the academics that they look up to,
4896180	4898180	if they're not saying this, then it can't be true.
4898180	4899180	Right.
4899180	4901180	It's like this weird dog.
4901180	4904180	It's like this weird dogma.
4904180	4909180	I think dogma is the best word to put it because they're not actually engaging with the material.
4909180	4913180	They're just, they're just engaging with it with a, well, I never heard that yet.
4913180	4914180	So that can't be real.
4914180	4916180	If this person doesn't agree, then I don't agree.
4916180	4917180	Right.
4917180	4918180	So I don't even have to read.
4918180	4921180	I'm not even going to read the past that he's, that he's highlighting.
4921180	4922180	I'm not even going to look at that Greek.
4922180	4923180	I'm not even going to do this.
4923180	4929180	I'm just going to assume that he's wrong because this person said he was wrong and sort of this person.
4929180	4932180	It starts, it starts a whole domino effect.
4932180	4938180	And next thing you know, you have a whole consensus of scholars saying that you're wrong.
4938180	4940180	The consensus says that Richard Miller is wrong.
4940180	4944180	I'm not saying that's happening, but I'm saying like that's, that's what comes out of it.
4944180	4952180	When one person just outright denying it and that person being on top of a pyramid of scholars under that person,
4952180	4953180	and they're all just going to follow suit.
4953180	4957180	And that's just that to me, it seems like that's what's happening a lot.
4957180	4958180	You become a symbol.
4958180	4965180	I mean, people carry around in their minds, usually these little like caricatures and little cocktail neck and sketches of what somebody,
4965180	4971180	if you go back and read Rudolph Wolfman, he doesn't look a lot like the cocktail neck and sketch of what people, you know,
4971180	4976180	he's kind of a poogie man in so many, you know, religious training context.
4976180	4980180	But if you go back and actually read him, you know, it's not like the same thing with Dennis McDonald.
4980180	4981180	You go back and read him.
4981180	4987180	I've talked to a number of people that, you know, rejected him out of hand when read his book and that, oh, okay.
4987180	4990180	Yeah, this is compelling.
4991180	4992180	That's right.
4992180	5004180	Some of these earlier scholars that I've since been built upon, but also like rejected, you know, the France Cumans of the, you know,
5004180	5009180	the Mithraic studies, you got James Fraser, you have, and then they get lumped.
5009180	5015180	So these people, I'm not saying that these people are correct in everything they said, they said a lot of stuff that I would disagree with.
5015180	5026180	But they get lumped in with like the DuPuis and the, like the really bad mythocyst type stuff from the 18th, 19th centuries, early 20th centuries.
5026180	5028180	And they just all get lumped in together.
5028180	5034180	And like, but like, if you actually read France Cumans, most of the stuff he's putting down is legit.
5034180	5038180	He's like the greatest Mithraic scholar prior to ever live.
5038180	5046180	And then James Fraser, he gets a lot of crap for some of the stuff that people just like, oh, that's James Fraser type of stuff.
5046180	5048180	What's so bad about James Fraser?
5048180	5050180	I mean, yeah, his stuff's outdated.
5050180	5053180	Yeah, it's older, but it's pretty good if you read it.
5053180	5054180	Right.
5054180	5055180	I won't say that about DuPuis.
5055180	5058180	DuPuis, that book is trash.
5058180	5059180	That book is horrible.
5059180	5062180	It's just taking stuff up out of the thin air.
5062180	5071180	So I do get, I do understand why there is some pushback against outdated material, but it almost seems, I don't know that you get, you get the point.
5071180	5078180	Yeah, I think that it's, it's for lack of knowledge, it's kind of contempt prior to investigation.
5078180	5091180	And, and also what would it, you know, if you've got people that are predicating their careers on their social kind of positioning within the larger topography.
5092180	5097180	Of this field, this career.
5097180	5112180	Why hazard that by hitching your, your career to a bunch of work that potentially threatens your reputation threatens your, your student reviews.
5113180	5120180	It, it isolates you or, you know, put you off on the margins, you're going to become pariah.
5120180	5122180	This kind of thing.
5122180	5123180	Why do that?
5123180	5130180	Well, the reason you do it is because you're supposed to be a scholar and not somebody that's playing a social game with your career.
5130180	5136180	But unfortunately, that's mostly what's going on with this because it is a social religion.
5136180	5137180	There's heresy.
5137180	5138180	There's orthodoxy.
5138180	5153180	There's all of these different paradigms and the winds that govern that even within the larger trust of Western academic history and ecclesiastical history are determining a lot of this, even the language that we use.
5153180	5155180	Like we went back to Pagan, this idea, Pagans.
5155180	5157180	There's so much more than that.
5157180	5159180	What's biblical Greek?
5159180	5163180	You know, that's not, it's not a thing.
5164180	5166180	It's made up.
5166180	5168180	Yeah, biblical lexicon.
5168180	5169180	What is that?
5169180	5170180	It doesn't exist.
5170180	5172180	There was no such thing.
5172180	5179180	So it's, we're putting, we're drawing these lines and a lot of that is, is coming out.
5179180	5183180	We're inheriting that from a larger power discourse.
5183180	5186180	Why are there even New Testament scholars at all?
5186180	5195180	Why, why would there be this group that's certified to be able to speak on this topic as if it were different than earliest?
5195180	5197180	This is just earliest Christian literature.
5197180	5199180	Why isn't, why aren't these just early Christian scholars?
5199180	5201180	Why aren't they just classes?
5201180	5202180	You know, right?
5202180	5208180	It should be Mediterranean, Mediterranean religions with like my main focus being New Testament or something.
5208180	5209180	Right.
5209180	5212180	It goes back to Foucault.
5212180	5213180	Yeah.
5213180	5224180	It goes back to Foucault and the kind of the way we, the power lines that we draw, the power discourse and the way that we divide up, who gets to speak on what.
5224180	5234180	And those are all arbitrary lines that don't have, they're actually bringing about violence and vandalizing the discussion.
5234180	5237180	And they're not helpful.
5237180	5239180	And so.
5239180	5240180	Yeah.
5240180	5244180	I mean, this has been a great conversation so far.
5244180	5245180	I couldn't agree more.
5245180	5251180	It's good to see that, like, because I can't determine that I'm correct and they're wrong.
5251180	5266180	Because as someone who's not trained, and I've only been really like going at this for a few years to probably three to four years now, like really, really like very much like doing it on a regular basis every day pretty much.
5266180	5271180	Learning Greek, learning a little bit of Hebrew, reading the sources.
5271180	5274180	And my main thing is more, I do read academic articles.
5274180	5279180	I shouldn't say I don't, but I love to read the primary sources the most.
5279180	5285180	Now, for me, I can't determine that I know things and they're wrong.
5285180	5292180	I have to like, I have to assume that I could have holes in my own thinking, and maybe they're correct.
5292180	5295180	And I just haven't gotten to where they're at yet.
5295180	5308180	But when I see people like you and Dennis McDonald and Robin, you know, just not even just just classics departments and Egyptologists that have the same sort of.
5308180	5316180	I was talking to Egyptologists recently, who was like mind blown that Christians don't talk about Halaria more.
5316180	5325180	Halaria was a festival that was celebrated all across the Mediterranean around the winter at the time of the spring equinox.
5325180	5327180	And it's a resurrection festival.
5327180	5330180	So it doesn't mean that Jesus didn't exist.
5330180	5336180	And this is all what I'm saying, like that motif or that sort of influence could have had some influence on.
5336180	5344180	I'm just saying like, this is what Egyptologists and the Egyptologists was very humble about it and saying, well, I'm not a New Testament scholar, so they probably had the reasons.
5344180	5347180	But it just seems like to me, it seems like there's something going on here.
5347180	5355180	And I'm just thinking imagine if somebody you put that together with some of the stuff that people are learning in New Testament, there might be something to look at here.
5355180	5357180	I'm just just an example.
5358180	5362180	Well, I'll go ahead and say it.
5362180	5364180	They are wrong. They should be studying these things.
5364180	5367180	They ought to be out there in studying the heck out of it.
5367180	5379180	If you're going to claim to be an expert in something, then you should go ahead and invest yourselves in immersing yourselves in the ancient thought world of where these texts got their traction.
5379180	5382180	Where were the communities at?
5382180	5388180	These were the cultural hubs of the ancient classical Mediterranean world, the ancient Roman world.
5388180	5399180	And yet very few in our field really have anything approaching a vivid understanding of those contexts in any way, in any form.
5399180	5402180	And so it's very rare, actually.
5402180	5406180	And so that to me is embarrassing.
5406180	5407180	It's embarrassing to the field.
5407180	5410180	And that's why classicists don't show up to SBL.
5410180	5414180	That's why literary scholars aren't showing up to SBL.
5414180	5425180	That's why a lot of these Assyrian, Assyriologists, ancient Near Eastern studies folks aren't showing up to SBL a lot.
5426180	5438180	They don't see this as a safe, as a normal place where they could set up a shop and have discussions about the ancient world in any kind of honest context.
5438180	5443180	Because they're around people that aren't trained in that way.
5443180	5445180	And it's a loaded topic.
5445180	5447180	It's full of all sorts of people that are there.
5447180	5452180	Most of the people at SBL are there because they're on some sort of religious pilgrimage.
5452180	5455180	And that's why they got their education to begin with.
5455180	5459180	And this is just where they happened to be, where it all got to at this point.
5459180	5463180	And so that's not everyone, but that's a lot of it.
5463180	5467180	And so that's not happening in any other field.
5467180	5470180	No other field is described that way.
5470180	5478180	And so I guess the closest you can get would be politics or something like that, or that's also highly loaded and charged topic.
5478180	5486180	But, you know, I don't think there's anything else really that comes close to what's going on with this discourse.
5486180	5496180	And so, you know, it's funny you said that because if we were looking at religions in India, they're all on the same language Sanskrit.
5496180	5503180	They're in the same geographical location, and they have the same sort of similar stories going on.
5503180	5505180	There's some overlap here.
5505180	5510180	We would, okay, we would already be dissecting it and looking at stuff and comparing them all.
5510180	5519180	But for some reason, in this region of Asia Minor and Greece, where Constantinople is, where Byzantium was,
5519180	5529180	we can't assume that the religions that precede Christianity in that region have any effect on the culture.
5529180	5534180	We're just going to assume that they just rejected their ancestors' culture and started a new thing there.
5534180	5536180	You would never do that anywhere else.
5536180	5543180	It's only in this part of the world where we assume that this special religion has got a force field around it,
5543180	5545180	and there's no influence from anywhere.
5545180	5552180	Even if it's the same geographical location, the same language using the same motifs and imagery and symbolism and all that stuff.
5552180	5553180	Right.
5553180	5559180	No, it goes beyond absurdity, really, if you think about it from much at all.
5559180	5567180	When I wrote, I decided that I was going to write for a future generation where this was not the case.
5567180	5571180	I had this persona in my mind.
5571180	5575180	How could my book be respected, like say, in 50 years?
5575180	5588180	Say we get past this, and our field is more secular, it's more true to the humanities and the normal processes and rigor that you could put around any other topic.
5588180	5601180	I had to try and aim for that as future readers, when they read my work, will they find it true and honest and compelling and correct and helpful, etc.
5601180	5606180	And so I decided to target that as kind of my readership for the book.
5606180	5614180	And that's a shame, because largely it has to do with, there's all sorts of reasons for that.
5614180	5619180	SPL invites just about anyone to go and be participant.
5619180	5622180	There's almost no constraints on anything that goes on there.
5622180	5634180	And so I heard one fellow gay that got up and gave a discussion on how true all the miracle, now we know that the miracles in the New Testament really happened.
5634180	5636180	And here's the proof of it.
5636180	5639180	And he got a standing ovation.
5639180	5641180	Of course.
5641180	5656180	Yeah, standing ovation. And I thought, okay, well, first, that's not true, because my own training and study shows that this would have been part and parcel with other ancient miracle and Mirabilia tales of the ancient.
5656180	5662180	So first off, they're driving the conversation a completely faith interested direction.
5662180	5677180	And, and secondly, and what other, in what other contexts, what are their academic context, it'd be like going to the British, you know, the Royal Royal Society and having, you know, they're, they're meeting their annual meeting and they're
5677180	5689180	talking about King Arthur and somebody gets up and talks about the historicity of Merlin, or something like this, and everyone gives a standing ovation.
5689180	5702180	It's really our time. It's an embarrassing time. And if you, I think future generations will look back on us and see what we've done, we basically, we're funding the academic legitimation of our own mythosystem.
5702180	5704180	Right.
5704180	5710180	And then that, and then like I said, and that in turn plays a huge role in a lot of things that happened throughout the world.
5710180	5718180	As a result, they're like, upholding some things that are that are affecting world events.
5718180	5738180	That's right. That's right. This is actually at risk. The future, the it's an existential threat by, by, you know, by possible relation, it's an exit, it produces a certain existential threats to our own species, in some ways, to not have clarity on these
5738180	5740180	issues is embarrassing.
5740180	5741180	Yep.
5741180	5742180	Well said.
5742180	5743180	Yeah.
5743180	5754180	So I just want to throw, throw out another link. There's links in the description for the book, resurrection and reception early Christianity, any other projects you got coming up coming up that you want to promote right now.
5754180	5772180	Well, I'm working on a book that has to do with the criminal aspects of earliest Christianity, you know, why are people getting thrown into prison and killed and so forth. Is it just because the Roman for monsters and all these trials were rigged and kangaroo trials and all that or were there actual laws being broken?
5772180	5791180	And maybe even intentionally being broken. And, and so it complicates the picture in some ways of the innocent kind of birth of Christianity. But I think that's another one I my tendency is to look where no one else is going the taboo topic, because that's where
5791180	5809180	usually the treasure's at. That's where the insights are at that haven't been really explored yet that really do balance picture and give it a lot more, make it a lot more true to the actual ancient world and and the rise of the religion.
5809180	5820180	So that's something that I'm exploring right now. I'm reaching out to other scholars and maybe maybe a joint project. And so if any of your viewers get excited about the topic.
5820180	5830180	Sounds great. And once again, this is a great discussion. Thanks for coming on and you have to take true noses.
5839180	5841180	Yeah.
