00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and welcome back to a new episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,880
this week's episode of this episode of our combination of 2 season 2 and you're

3
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,040
about to attain trunosis. And today we're going to talk about the question I've been asking

4
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:21,320
Bible scholars for years and I cannot get to the bottom of this question. And there, if

5
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:27,800
it's about Mark 14 the grandest chapter of all the chapter is Mark. Mark is the first

6
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,120
most important gospel, in my opinion, is the mystery, the mystery being revealed.

7
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:39,240
But when we get to chapter 14, all of a sudden, all these mysterious things are happening.

8
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,960
Jesus' feet are being anointed. The Peter is being told that the cock will crow three times,

9
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:53,240
and then he will deny Jesus. And all these weird stuff that doesn't make sense in English.

10
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,440
And so I decided, if the Bible scholars aren't telling me what's going on at the end of Mark 14

11
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:07,960
with this little boy in the Garden of Gethsemane running away naked as Jesus is being arrested

12
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:13,880
by Judas and people bearing the torches, if the Bible scholars can't tell me what's going on here,

13
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,600
I'm going to turn it into the classicists. Because the classicists, they know the Greek.

14
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,160
So you can't learn a lot about classical Greek through the Koinei,

15
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,960
but you can learn a lot about the Koinei through the classical Greek because the

16
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,200
Koinei comes out of classical Greek. Does that make sense? So with that being said,

17
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,800
before we get into anything, I just want to let you guys know Lady Babylon.

18
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:41,640
Go and subscribe. Nobody on the internet is going as deep as Dr. Amon, who is my guest today.

19
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,880
Dr. Amon, how are you doing today?

20
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,120
Great, great, Neil. Thanks for having me. It's so nice to be here.

21
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,320
Absolutely. I'm looking forward to this. Links in the description for the channel.

22
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,840
Go and subscribe. And it's one of some of the best stuff out there.

23
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,560
Some of the, like I said, there's different types of scholars and you and people like Dr. Ruck

24
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,480
who are not afraid to step on people's toes and get a little dirty once in a while.

25
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,880
This is where it's at Lady Babylon. And yeah, check it out. But let's get into this topic of

26
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:25,880
Mark 14. What is this? I'm actually going to let you take it away for a little bit.

27
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,840
I'll jump in with a few questions here and there. But this is something that needs to be explained

28
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,320
a little more than just a couple of sentences. We need to go through, let's go through the Greek

29
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,200
systematically and describe what's going on here. And then maybe we can come to a conclusion.

30
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:48,120
Yeah, that's my, that's my bag to nail. I love it when you call up the sources and you're just

31
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,880
like, let's just look at what they said and see what we can gather from what they're saying.

32
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:59,800
We just listen in for a moment. So let's jump right into those sources. I want to, Neil knows,

33
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:06,520
I want to bring you the apocalypse, right? I want to show you. I want that thing revealed.

34
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:13,880
I want that sacred made profane so that you can get in there and Jesus's world

35
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:20,040
right there with him and see him for what he is. So let's go to the, let's go to the very first

36
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,840
passage. This is Mark, right? We're taking the Gospels here. Yeah.

37
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:43,480
And there was this kid, some kid was with him. And this verb soon accoluthae, right?

38
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:51,960
From soon accoluthae. Oh, this verb is what you talk about when you talk about slaves being assigned

39
00:04:52,040 --> 00:05:00,680
to someone. So there's some slave kid assigned to him. Yeah. And he's petty, this is from Perry

40
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:09,560
Balo. Nice, nice, you know, standard, standard Greek just means to throw and Perry means around.

41
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:16,200
Yeah. He's thrown around himself. He's using something. What is he using? Seendona.

42
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,160
He's using a Seendona. And we have the word here for Seendona. This is everybody knows this

43
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,080
passage. This kid with this thing. Can we see some, Neil, can we see some of the,

44
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:35,080
yeah, look what kind of translations we have. Yeah. I just pulled out a whole plethora of

45
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,680
English so that nobody can say, but what about this one? Here we have all laid out for us.

46
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:46,520
Yeah. The NIV down to the King James. It says, oh, I'm sorry, this is the wrong verse. Okay, sorry.

47
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:54,680
Here, a young man wearing nothing but a linen garment was following Jesus. But if I'm not mistaken,

48
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:03,720
young man, we're talking, the word Neo, Neoniscos is young boy. Isn't that the right

49
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,920
correction, correct translation for that? It comes from the root, it comes from the root,

50
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:17,320
Neil, Neos, and that is the idea of the budding. The idea is not a specific age group. Could this

51
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:25,160
kid be an early teenager? Hmm. It's the bud. He's in the, in the, in the newness of his life.

52
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:31,560
And that's important because remember, it's their world, not our world. We're imposing our view on

53
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:39,080
it, right? They're looking at this budding kid wearing nothing, right? Put a linen garment.

54
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,840
Ooh, that's a little bit of a stretch, right? A garment. Doesn't say garment there, right?

55
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:51,800
Linen shirt. Look at the next one. A linen shirt. Oh, yeah. Nothing but a linen cloth. Yeah, right?

56
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,240
See all the different kind of clothing that you end up getting in this, right? Because we want to

57
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:03,400
dress Jesus, but hey, let's pull up Alice, Neil, like, you know, we love to do. And let's see,

58
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:09,640
let's see what that seam done is. Look at this. So seam done is the linen cloth of the translation

59
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,360
that we're looking at. But this is, this is from Persia's top. So we'd like to call Alice,

60
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,640
because we're going into Alice Wonderland. We're going into the sources. This is all the times

61
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:29,960
his words use in the context. Fine cloth, usually linen, okay? Use for mummies. Surgeon bandages.

62
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,280
Wait a minute. Herodotus uses this word. I don't know if you guys know how to read

63
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:42,840
the Perseus Toss, but there you see that HDT 286. Herodotus in book two, verse 86,

64
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:51,960
use this word for a surgeon bandage. And what's cool, Neil, is Helen talks about these drugs.

65
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,960
I was a grad student trying to figure this out. And one day I was reading a text that said they

66
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:04,440
take this bandage and they impregnate it, they put the medicine in it, and then wrap the wound.

67
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:10,440
And okay, so anyway, let's go back to the passage. It's a band, right?

68
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,640
This is a medical use for it. So you're saying Galen uses this word for medical.

69
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:24,440
Yes, and not just Galen, right? But it's just referring to a strip of cloth. And this kid,

70
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:30,200
if you go back to our original text, that first one, this kid is wearing it. He's seen very

71
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:39,080
specifically, he says epigumnu on his place of shame, on his place of shame. He's wearing it,

72
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:52,440
right? Let's keep reading it. Let's keep reading it. And they took possession of him.

73
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:59,480
They arrested him. They strong armed him. There it's talking about Jesus. Typically,

74
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,920
they try to say this was the boy. But it doesn't make sense if it's the boy with the next Greek

75
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:19,320
that we have. The one who was naked fled after leaving his bandage. Yeah, right? Why? Because

76
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:26,120
they're not trying to strong arm the kid, right? They're trying to strong arm Jesus.

77
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:34,680
And that's when Jesus says so importantly, which is our next text. Check out this next text.

78
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:42,600
This one? Yeah. Yeah. And Jesus answers them, right? And he said to them, did you come out here

79
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:54,120
against me as if I were a laystace? Having your clubs and your weapons, you know, you're going

80
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:00,360
to take me this way? Yeah, your clubs and your swords, right? What are you doing? It's that famous

81
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:08,840
passage. But everybody remembers the laystace, Robert or the pirate, right? Jesus is saying,

82
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:15,160
I'm a pirate, right? Look there at the very bottom under Roman numer number two. Yeah. And you see the

83
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:25,080
cupris, the pirate of Cyprus. Oh, the reference, the reference and lycophron to 1143, where we

84
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:36,200
are talking about abducting young women to be sold to others for things like slavery,

85
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:45,080
sexual gratification, you can sell to a temple, they could have been sold off as priestesses,

86
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:52,200
right? But these are Jesus does, you're not coming out against me like I'm with all these weapons,

87
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:59,720
like I'm a some kind of child trafficker. So that's what he's saying with me says you're that I

88
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:06,360
didn't know that that that brings a lot of context to what he's talking about. Yeah. Yeah. So now,

89
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:13,480
you know, what about Jesus and child children and child sack of child trafficking? And is there

90
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:19,880
anything else if we're just detectives saying this is the this is the evidence we have and from the

91
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:25,160
Garden of Gethsemane, we have that one piece of evidence, we have that kid's

92
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:35,880
penile wrap, we have the penile wrap of the child. Yeah, that's the only like fragment of history

93
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:43,080
that was left at the scene, right? Otherwise, we know Jesus is saying he's not a pirate and he's

94
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:52,360
got it covered with some stuff that you write that they don't know, right? We're not like look,

95
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:59,400
we're not when it's not like we're pulling stuff out of our space, like the text tells us there's

96
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:06,040
a little boy in him in with him in the garden, as he's being arrested, who runs away naked.

97
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,600
Like we're this is not like we're not like going to like some apocryphal text somewhere and like

98
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:19,400
pulling out some random this is in the text in Mark. And so we're just asking questions like

99
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:25,480
what's going on here? Is it an initiation? Is there I've heard people say there was a resurrection,

100
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,920
you know, they say, oh, you know, he wasn't there. He didn't go there with John and and whoever

101
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,280
else was there. He just was there in the cemetery and Jesus resurrected him. I've heard that theory,

102
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:41,160
but the text doesn't say that. We're just adding stuff to whatever we want to the text.

103
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:47,880
The text doesn't say that. It only says there's a little boy who ran away naked. So what's going on

104
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:54,280
here? And the best thing to do now that's why I love to hang with you is because it's just those

105
00:12:54,280 --> 00:13:00,520
texts that matter. I can come up with a theory for what's going on. It doesn't do me any good.

106
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,880
If I just treat those texts, and that's what I want to jump. I want to jump. Okay, I didn't want to do

107
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:12,680
this originally, but the last slide that the last. Yeah, there. Hey, guys, let's just I want to cut

108
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:18,440
to the chase on this one. Look at this. This is I don't want to talk about the background of this

109
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:24,600
thing whatsoever. People classify the pseudo climate. You can take that and deal with it. What

110
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:32,200
you want. I'm interested in the language here and what what the Greek is saying. So yeah. So

111
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:45,080
Jesus is mad, man, right right off the bat. And he came back with her, this woman to the garden

112
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:53,960
where was the male? Where was the cemetery? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And right away he heard from the

113
00:13:53,960 --> 00:14:03,480
cemetery, right from this tomb on Phone Megali, a great voice and approaching. You know, Jesus

114
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:10,600
moved off the stone from the doorway of the tomb and entering in there right there was this

115
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:17,160
neoniskos. You can see this on the one, two, three, four, fifth line down. Neoniskos. See the

116
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:24,280
neoniskos. Yeah, yeah. Okay. And there was a neoniskos there. And what is he doing? He's stretching

117
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:34,920
out his hand and waking him up. Isn't that cool? He's waking. Wait, do you realize that we heard a

118
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:45,160
voice and we entered a tomb where a kid has to be roused? Where he has to be roused? Okay. Wow.

119
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,680
Thank you. Okay. Probably smells like opium in here, right? Okay.

120
00:14:54,280 --> 00:15:01,240
Right. Honeoniskos. And so the kid does what? He looks up at him and he loves him.

121
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:11,640
He loves him. And remember, this is in a text that itself says, hey, Jesus was here a fan.

122
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:19,560
Wake up, people. Jesus was a here a fan. And what is it? It's in the text, yeah. One who teaches

123
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:26,440
the rites of sacrifice and worship, right? In Rome, it's just the pontiff. Herodotus uses it for

124
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:34,600
the initiation at Elusis. Yes, yes. So this is a very specific role. We have another source from

125
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:41,000
Plutarch says that this is what they call the pontifix maximus in Rome or the Jewish high priest.

126
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So this is somebody who's religious, who's doing rites, hero funds, specifically those mystical

127
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,880
rites that we call the mystery, that we call the mystery. So if you go back to that text,

128
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:03,000
here we go. Here we go. What is he doing? He's with the kid there and he rouses him up. The kid

129
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,440
looking at him loves him. And Elxato Paracalene started to ask him that he might be with him.

130
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:21,400
What? And coming out from the tomb, Jesus went into the home, the oikia, the estate

131
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:31,320
of the kid for this kid was wealthy. He was loaded. And after six days, Jesus gave him

132
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:40,280
instructions about how to look. And the kid came and wrapped around himself a scene done

133
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,840
he wrapped his scene down on his nakedness. Yeah. And he remained with him.

134
00:16:51,160 --> 00:17:04,760
He remained with him for the night. Yeah, throughout the night. And now this is the kicker.

135
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:17,800
This is the kicker right at the end. And that guard there is telling you why did he stay with the

136
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:29,960
kid all night throughout the night? Because he was teaching him the musterion. Oh, mystery. Yeah.

137
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:40,040
And that's, that's what the chapter is leading up to. It's this, this scene in the garden. Yeah. Yeah.

138
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,920
I think it might be the longest chapter in Mark. I'm going to be wrong. It's one of the longest,

139
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:51,800
at least, but it leads up to this. And it's, it's very mysterious. There's something happening here.

140
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:58,440
And I think these, these Greek words are telling us, like, for example, you know, how we define

141
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:06,440
Hierophant, teaching the rites or the Sindon wearing the Sindon. So I'm, and I'm thinking in my head,

142
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:12,680
is there a relation to this? And this is another gospel, but like, I know this is like the

143
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,760
scholars say, don't compare gospel to gospel. They're two different writers, but like,

144
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:23,480
I can't help it. The, in John, you have the, the disciple whom Jesus loved. I wonder if this is

145
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:29,560
Mark's way of telling about who this character is, some sort of initiate, some sort of apprentice, maybe.

146
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:38,520
Yeah. And what's the connection with the boy having been assigned to Jesus? Like you buy a

147
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:44,040
slave to do something for a certain amount of time, you know, he's renting the person.

148
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:52,440
Right. And a lot of times the, these little kiddie slaves, they, they're involved in things that

149
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:59,400
aren't just for kids. And you think for yourself, you're sitting there and you think, oh, wait a

150
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:05,400
minute, I'm starting to make me a little bit nauseous. Yeah. Let's go back to the actual language.

151
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:11,480
Right. Because Jesus has a point where some people get upset at him. It's some of his own

152
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:19,240
followers and they say, Hey, stop treating the children like this says he was touching them.

153
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:25,800
And the word there is grabbing and also hop to pull hop to up. Here it is. Hop to.

154
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:32,200
I got it. Hop to. Yeah. Look at this people hop to. Can be, you know, it's not just touching

155
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:41,160
like, you know, touching. It's grabbing, right? It's, it's engaging something or attacking something.

156
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,880
Context and a wrestling. So yeah, that's a specific touch right there. And if, and if you look at number

157
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:53,400
five under Roman numer, number three, you see that it means to have straight up intercourse.

158
00:19:53,400 --> 00:20:00,040
Oh my God. It can actually be used in that context. And it is used by Paul and Corinthians that way.

159
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Wow. Okay. So my mind is officially blown right now. For those of you who think, you know,

160
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,160
for those of you who think, you know, coin a, Neil, can you take that off from

161
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:19,880
an appeal of vanity? Oh yeah. One second. It's got to go back down. Okay. Go ahead.

162
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:26,520
For those of you who don't think that, for those of you who think, you know, coin a.

163
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:35,880
Yeah. Kick up your stuff because yeah, you're going to need it. You're going to need it. He was,

164
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:44,120
so he's, he is in a situation where he's doing this to children and the, a group of his followers

165
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:51,000
stopped the parents from allowing it to take place and they say, Hey, stop doing this. And it says

166
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,320
they're upset and it uses Tima, which typically can be used in a kind of illegal sense. It's got

167
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:04,280
just a smidge of something judges say, right? Now let's tell you that that it's used by judges.

168
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:12,760
And so yeah. And so it's, it's a funny thing that they get these kids and Jesus steps up and

169
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:19,320
he says, he's angry and he says, no, you cannot enter into the kingdom

170
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:31,160
unless you are one of these children. Let's look at what he's talking about because it has this,

171
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:36,520
it has just a, just for us, it's just like, no, no, no, don't think that, don't think that,

172
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:43,960
right? But let's see what the Greeks were thinking. When he talks about his paideia,

173
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:49,560
what are these paideia people don't realize, right? Little children are following around Jesus,

174
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:59,720
why they need the prayer. He's going to, he's going to engage them. And he's going to enter into a

175
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:09,560
prayer and we see this in the performance of the mystery. And of course, that's why Jesus is so

176
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:16,440
out of this, you can't get into the kingdom unless you come by this avenue, right? Now,

177
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:23,800
what is this paidzo? What is it? What is this child thing in the, in the ancient Greek mind and the

178
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:30,280
ancient Mediterranean mind that was wrapped up in the, on the Hellenistic side with the Greek,

179
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,880
things are coming from their verbs. I want you to just take a look at this verb.

180
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:48,440
It is the base for child and it means to dance or play or play amorously. Wow. When you have the

181
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:59,880
word paideia in Greek, it is understood that there is a relationship between the teacher

182
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:09,720
and the teacher. And it has to do with touching and it has to do with the maturation of the bud,

183
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,960
right? You want to bring that bud to perfection. That's what they looked at

184
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:24,920
as purification, as education, excuse me, as education, as paideia. That's why they call

185
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:35,880
the horsemen who are hung the teachers of the princes. That's why they call them

186
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:48,120
pedarasts. That's a Greek word for that teacher, the pedarast. When Jesus is calling for paideia,

187
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:58,440
he is calling for victims of pedarasty. And we know that the, at least his attitude reflects this,

188
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:04,120
because when he gets called short on it, he says, you're going to end up scandalizing me,

189
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:10,360
right? Right? So for those of you who have the little Jesus blessed me and whatnot,

190
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:17,880
realize there's a tradition of directly touching children, of molesting children

191
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:26,360
associated with the rites and the mystery, okay? Neil, you know. Not a controversial statement.

192
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:32,760
Any classes this will say, yeah, this is part of the Greek world. This was normalized in the

193
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,480
Greek. I'm not saying I think we should bring it back or anything. I'm just saying that's the

194
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,960
reality of the fact. The Greeks were, you know what I'm saying? It's just the reality of it.

195
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:51,560
Actually, in fact, somewhere over here, I have a book titled Paralytes. And this scholar put

196
00:24:51,560 --> 00:25:05,000
together like tons of texts of ancient Greek that are very, very graphic, sexual. And nine times out

197
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:12,760
of 10, it's an older male with a prepubescent boy. Nine times out of 10. That's what these texts are

198
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:23,400
portraying. We've got gods who have boys that pour their nectar. And we have gods

199
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:34,040
who are great mothers who bring their boys to maturation. These are essential to the mystery

200
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:40,520
rites. Both of the ones I just mentioned to you. Heracles performs mystery rites. The temples to

201
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:47,640
Heracles are temples where mystery rites are performed. Yes, fantastic. What about you thought

202
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:54,520
it was all athletics, right? So these are the same thing. They're doing the same things. When

203
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:59,160
you have the great mother and she's important, the great mother entering this whole equation,

204
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:10,200
you take that young boy Addis and you bring him into a point of burning off all of his

205
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:19,080
mortality, right? It's a process. And this idolatrous process involves a lot of drugs.

206
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,040
And I think, Neil, that's one of the areas that people, we can look at texts like this.

207
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,200
And we can say, oh my goodness, Jesus was a downright

208
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:37,480
magus. He was right in this, right in this magus tradition. Neil, why did, why did these magi

209
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:47,400
show up? I didn't say the three. These magi, why did they show up and say, brah, your child right

210
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:54,200
here, the one that was just born, we've been following his esterian. Yeah. And what we're

211
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:01,960
going to do is he's going to be the one who bears the, is that vessel that's straight up mystery,

212
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:08,760
that Christos, that's straight up mystery. There's a group of dudes imposing this upon him

213
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:15,960
from the beginning and giving him drugs. Jesus had drugs from the start. You cannot make these

214
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,400
drugs without the two bases that they gave him. They gave him frankincense and myrrh.

215
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,600
They gave him frankincense and myrrh and your preachers can preach all day. Anyone that knows

216
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:36,680
the orphic tradition, if you have a copy of the orphic hymns, those two oils are burnt in offering

217
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:42,600
to these pagan deities. You offer frankincense and then you do a hymn to Nyx, the goddess,

218
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:50,600
or a hymn to Hercules or something. Those are the two main oils that are burned in the orphic

219
00:27:50,600 --> 00:28:00,040
fragments. That's what you're offering up before you take your incense and you offer it up to induce

220
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:05,720
because we know within the mystery, this is pretty cool. We know from later sources through the

221
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:16,200
Neopathagoreans that daemonace, demons function by smell. So the first Christian anti-drug laws

222
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:24,440
are specifically against drugs that are used to promote this process, to either drive away the

223
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:31,240
demons or to collect them. What are the pagans going to do? What can they do? Look at this.

224
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:37,160
I just flipped through a random page in the orphic hymns of Orpheus. Flip through a random page.

225
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:43,480
First thing it says, to Vulcan, offer fumigation of frankincense and manna.

226
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,360
I'm adding to what you just said. The point is, when you offered these frankincense and you lit it

227
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:57,960
up and the oil would burn, you're literally, the gods are smelling this and they would come

228
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:04,200
and they would listen to your hymn. That's how you contact with the gods in the Greek world.

229
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:11,400
No different in Christianity. Think of it this way. There's a place that you can go and you can buy

230
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:22,200
this smirna and this a woman puts on and in her vagina and it's a compound drug and what does it

231
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:33,080
smell like? It smells exactly like where it is. It is a place of bringing forward from death life.

232
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:43,720
It is a funk that they use in Ritu, in Rite, that involves the orgasmos, right?

233
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:50,760
So yeah, all of this stuff is, this is, I keep trying to convince people, Neil, that the pharmacy

234
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:57,800
and antiquity as we look at it, we're looking very, very two-dimensionally. When you blow it up

235
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:02,520
and look at it and say, look, they, they have this idea that comes from the Bronze Age,

236
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:08,200
that you can take a person and you can put them under the influence of certain drugs,

237
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:18,280
including venoms, you know, bee stings, spider, scorpion stings, all of these different venoms

238
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:24,280
that they're using. You can take a person and put them under that influence, right, and kick them

239
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:32,840
into a place called the Eremon, right, into the desert, where they will be forced to deal with

240
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:42,440
Lucifer, right, where they will be forced in that place. That kingdom is his kingdom. So yeah.

241
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,600
You mentioned, hold on a second, this is really deep, what you just said.

242
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:55,960
You mentioned the Magi tradition. In the, in the Zendivesta, which is a text that predates the

243
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:05,400
Gospels by a long centuries, very much, very old. There's a text where Zoroaster is in the desert

244
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:14,600
and he's roaming the desert and he's rushed by Anger Manu. And Anger Manu says, if you will

245
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:21,240
renounce the good God, Ahura Mazda, I'll give you the boons to rule all the nations.

246
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:28,200
And then Ahura Mazda, or then Zoroaster just starts chanting and then he makes Anger Manu leave.

247
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:34,760
Well, this is what you see in the Gospels, with Jesus in the desert being tempted by the devil,

248
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,320
who says, if you worship me, I'll give you all, I'll give you all the kingdoms of the world.

249
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,920
Exactly. This is coming from that tradition that you're talking about.

250
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:48,440
You see how it's part of the mystery and how it fits in and you see, oh, this is why they're doing

251
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:54,440
what they're doing. It's our Magi that, that, that recite these texts. There's a lot of drugs.

252
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:03,960
There's a lot of drugs and there are drug texts. I was reading one last month about this bites of

253
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:11,960
spiders and what to do and how to treat and what groups are using these types of drugs.

254
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:20,520
And the, the pharmacy is complex. It's really complex, but they are taking the human body

255
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:29,560
and they are turning it into a means of giving drugs to other people. So this whole thing about

256
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:34,520
people are shocked when they're like, what? I'm like, look, if you were in an ancient riot,

257
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:40,120
they're going to drug you beforehand. They're going to tie your hands behind your back,

258
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:48,120
restrain your ankles. They're going to sodomize you with a, a, an alabaster. It's a device.

259
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:54,520
By the way, that's also in Mark 14. Yes. Same chapter, same chapter that we're discussing

260
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:00,520
with the little boy. This chapter opens up with the alabaster, which is another mystery,

261
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:05,400
mystery religion term that you see thrown around there. And if you see how people translate,

262
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:11,160
it's always hilarious, right? I mean, they don't even make sense rationally. He busted the jar and

263
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:15,560
it was, that's how you do it. You break. No. And they're all mad. Remember the other things.

264
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:23,560
Remember, they're all mad because it was very expensive, right? What do you think that very

265
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:30,200
expensive stuff is for? That's the stuff that the initiates are using. That's the, that's the

266
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,480
hardcore. People aren't realized, but they have so many drugs in the ancient world. So many.

267
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:41,640
You can't even talk about arrows without talking the arrow poison that they're using in different

268
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:46,440
parts of the world. They're also getting high off it, but they're taking a person's body

269
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:52,840
and they're turning that person's body into the producer of the blood,

270
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:01,720
the hyma, which can also be ejaculate. Okay. So when Jesus' face is covered with that sticky stuff,

271
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:08,360
and it says it was his hedros, that it was his, originally it looks like sweat and it turns into

272
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:14,520
what looks like hyma. You know, that hyma is used especially in cold contexts

273
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:24,440
to the essence substance. You get the hyma, Zeus gets the hyma when he sucks the penis of

274
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:32,280
the invisible one. Doesn't this happen to Priapis too? Yeah.

275
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:40,760
Mm-hmm. And if you get that, yeah, no, he is that fanase. Yeah, fanase is that Priapis,

276
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,160
the invisible one is that Priapis, right? I mean, you said you were going to the wilderness.

277
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:50,040
You wanted to go, right? You took the drug, so they've got you and they've got you bound and

278
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:57,160
they've got you giving it to them. And by the way, the guy who's writing our letter,

279
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:04,680
whether it's Udo Clement or whatever, whoever is writing that letter says there are these dudes

280
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:12,520
who are doing things very good, who are doing things that are not, they're following the way of

281
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:19,480
Satan into the darkness, he says right here. Those carpocratians, too. Yeah, those carpocratians,

282
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:25,160
and what are they doing? They're doing unspeakable things with the flesh.

283
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:33,240
Deep things. And with, yeah. Puffed up with gnosis. It actually says puffed up gnosis.

284
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:39,960
This is so crazy, man. We're going deep right now. I'm loving this.

285
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:47,400
And Neil, you're so, you're even closer than you think with that puffed up because that's the

286
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:55,960
word for being, for bringing us its Pephocilmino on page on line five there, two, three, four, five.

287
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:04,280
Yeah. It's also used for snakes, making the noise of a hissing. Yeah. There might be a little bit

288
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:11,000
of terminology that's sneaking in here. These may be a specific group of people. For example,

289
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:19,560
they call the ioboloi ehidnon. Those are the poison throwers of the echidna, or the vipers.

290
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:27,000
The vipers are a group, a college of priestesses, and the ioboloi are the ones who pour the poison.

291
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:35,240
And by the way, these carpocratians are deriving their theology from biblical texts. They're not,

292
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:43,000
like, they get called heretics later on and in this text. But they're looking at Jesus as the

293
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:52,520
serpent in the desert that Moses held up. And John says, just as Moses held up a serpent in the desert,

294
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,440
so too shall the Son of Man be lifted up. The carpocratians, that's central to them.

295
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,440
They call themselves, they call them the ophites, the nascines. They're all snake,

296
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:10,520
nas means serpent in Hebrew. Ophite, serpent. These are, these nostics are getting their theology,

297
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,800
not just from making stuff up. They're getting it from the Bible.

298
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:23,400
Right. Right. And he is accused of being a mystic god in that process. The thing that I like about

299
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:30,360
the church as a classical philologist, I can completely ignore them. I can completely ignore

300
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:36,600
them. You can hit me with antinomy in this and this interpretation of that. It's all bullshit

301
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:43,000
because of the time, at the time that we have these documents that are talking about this cult

302
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,160
activity with Jesus, there are none of these people. They don't exist. Right. So if we go back

303
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:55,720
to that original context with your brain, the, the ophites, for example, yeah, the orphics,

304
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:03,480
that was the snake in the breast. That was their symbol. Right. Yeah. That was a snake in the breast.

305
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:10,680
So, and he says, the author of this letter says, Hey, um, you know that they're doing these things

306
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:17,000
and these awful things and we cannot, we cannot, uh, get involved. And he's like, even if he's

307
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:24,040
saying true stuff, you have to deny. Right. So there's probably, there might be a Christian

308
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:30,120
watching right now who's saying, Orphics, that's pagan. That has nothing to do with Christianity.

309
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:37,480
We'll check this out. Pseudopigrafa. This is all Bible. This is all Pseudopigrafa Bible text.

310
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:44,760
There's a whole section just dedicated to the Orphics. In fact, it goes even deeper than that.

311
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:51,560
The Orphics that were living in Alexandria, where are you going over who came first? Moses

312
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:59,560
or Orpheus? And then they, if you point to the text of Plato, Plato says, Mousseus is the son of Orpheus.

313
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:06,680
And so they're trying to wrestle with this idea that Moses can't be subservient to Orpheus. It's

314
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:12,680
got to be the other way around. And you see this back and forth happening in the first century,

315
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:18,920
where people are trying to claim Orpheus as their prophet. But we know the real Orpheus,

316
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:24,840
we know it really, Orpheus was a Dionysian high priest. He was the high priest of Bacchus

317
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:31,640
and the son of Apollo. He was connected, baby. Orpheus is the real deal. He's the poet. He's

318
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:39,880
the bard. He's the prophet telling the future. So you can't get these monotheists in the first

319
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:46,120
century are trying to claim him as one of their own. They're known. You can't do it down. This

320
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:53,320
is Bacchic. This is Pythagorean. This is, you know what I mean? This is, that's the real source.

321
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:59,880
Celsus is so gene. This is why I love Celsus. He's so brilliantly calls out the Christians.

322
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:06,040
You guys are just a degradation of the real thing. Just a degradation. He's like the real deal comes

323
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:12,920
out of Egypt. And the Christians are, they're Sybilist. But they're a degradation of the Sybilist.

324
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:18,040
And the Sybilist, the Sybilist religion is the religion of Rome. The Sybilian books. If you,

325
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:23,720
if you look at the history of the Sybilian books, the Sybilian books is what guides Rome and all

326
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:29,720
these wars against Carthaginians, against the Greeks, against whoever. The Sybilian books tells

327
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:35,400
them what to do. Go and import Magna Mater from Phrygia. Bring her into the temple. If you do this,

328
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,560
you'll win the war. And they're doing it. And it's all documented throughout history.

329
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:46,120
Third century, second century BCE, you see the Romans following these Sybilian books. And then

330
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:50,520
all of a sudden, third, second century, third century, the common era, all of a sudden, these

331
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,520
Sybilian books are just Christian now. They're not pagan anymore. They become Christianized.

332
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:02,040
So you see that this tradition, as Celsus points out, is a degradation of the original

333
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,880
pagan rites, these mystery rites.

334
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,040
Can I say, can I get an N?

335
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:19,160
Yeah.

336
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,400
Yeah, I fell out of there. Sorry about that. Am I back?

337
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,000
Yeah, you're, Ben, you're good.

338
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:35,560
Okay. It just my, you know, I was just wanting to say amen. Amen. Amen. And that locks it in.

339
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:43,320
I am the amen. I am the amen all over the world. There are Christians and they're

340
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:51,640
thanking the Lord Jesus Christ for their food. And they're saying in Jesus Christ's name, I pray, amen.

341
00:41:52,600 --> 00:42:02,840
Don't realize that they are borrowing a pagan magic ritual in the pronunciation of that name.

342
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:11,640
That when they say amen, they are induced, they are introducing a Satanian or what I would call

343
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:21,400
Satanic magical device. When Jesus says the kingdom of Uranus, now you know why he talks

344
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:28,280
about the fire coming from Uranus because it's a pagan. Those are your mystery terms.

345
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:35,400
Those are your mystery terms. Jesus is not making up new stuff. For those of you out there who are

346
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:43,640
following the fairy tale of modern Christianity, be it Catholic or Protestant,

347
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:54,920
surprise, surprise. This is not a fairy tale and Jesus is there using the mystery in his own

348
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:01,320
direction. When he sits on the cross and he's yelling out, I'm thirsty. I'm thirsty. I'm thirsty.

349
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:08,920
Guess what? The physicians say this is what happens when you use the horned North African

350
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:16,520
viper venom. This is what you get. That's why they called it the dipsauce because it creates this

351
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:24,040
intense thirst. Not only is Jesus arrested with a naked boy, but he is on drugs and he's on mystery

352
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:33,800
drugs that we have reams of antidote in ancient Greek and Latin. We have reams of antidotes for

353
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:41,400
these things. The down and dirty picture of Jesus. Neil, do you think he's like the

354
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:47,240
Baptists who are out with their penis-shaped cups and their boys that they take out and

355
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:56,760
baptize? Do you think that's the group he's in? He's got his racket set up where he's got his

356
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:04,360
naked children, right? I want to go back to something you just mentioned because the oldest

357
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:11,560
source of the story of Moses that we have goes back to an Alexandrian priest in the fourth century

358
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:22,040
during one of the Ptolemy's reigns. He writes this story about Moses.

359
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:29,560
Supposedly, it's right before the Septuagint gets written. We had this story about this. The guy who

360
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:38,840
writes this story is an Egyptian pagan. He, in some of his texts, and I'm Corey's ancient fragments,

361
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:43,800
this is the text that I'm citing here, where he shows this guy is using this term,

362
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:50,920
hallelujah, amen, in some of his writings. Plutarch, in the first century, the second

363
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:58,200
century, the common era, he comments on this, on this exact person, and he says that he cites this

364
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:05,720
person. What's his name? Hang on, let me find his name. But anyways, while I'm finding his name,

365
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:12,680
this is what he says about him. He says that the word Amon, the god Amon, is the king of all the

366
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:22,440
gods of Egypt. He says that when Egyptians call on or call to any of the gods, not just Amon,

367
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:32,280
any of the gods, when they finish their prayers or when they're calling out to one another,

368
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:43,080
they use the term Amon. And we know that ancient Egyptian and ancient Hebrew, there is no vowels,

369
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:51,320
amen. So, some people, I'm one of them that this has been decided on by, a lot of scholars will

370
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:55,960
say that I'm going on fringe territory now. I don't care because I haven't heard any

371
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:01,240
better explanation of where that term comes from, better than what Plutarch says. It's in the

372
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:07,480
text, I'm Isis and Osiris, where he says that word Amon is the word that's used to

373
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:15,480
enchant and to call on any of the gods. So, I'm thinking that's your source right there.

374
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:29,800
So, when Jesus says, I am the amen, you can hear that he is deep in this thing. It's no wonder that

375
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:37,080
he would want to be called the Christ and what the Christ was because that is the one within

376
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:45,320
the right who is performing that mystery transformation, right? Oh my god, it's wonderful.

377
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:52,440
Drink of my blood, right? Love it. You know, they were doing that, right? So, it's not like

378
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:58,920
it's not like it's out of place. Beautiful. Yeah. Who's your amen?

379
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:09,880
Right, that term, amen. Yeah. It's fascinating though because I've only seen a few academics that

380
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:15,880
actually engage with this verse that Plutarch and I'm talking about from Isis and Osiris.

381
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:22,680
And the person that he cites is the person who writes the story about Moses,

382
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:29,720
pre-Bible. Like before the Septuagint is put together, this guy's writing stories about Moses

383
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:35,480
and it turns out that he's the guy who cites for this amen thing. So, I don't know. I don't know.

384
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:39,480
What do you guys think? And I'm interested to hear what people think about that.

385
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:49,880
We also have Olo Luzo. The verb in Greek, Olo Luzo, means to cry out in ecstasy. It can be,

386
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:56,200
it's usually like a... Oh, Hecateus. Sorry to cut you off. Hecateus of Abdera. I couldn't think of

387
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:01,560
the name but I found it now. Hecateus of Abdera. And going back, we're going back to ancient Egypt,

388
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:07,640
you know? Do you know how much it turns me on to have you quote Hecateus of Abdera?

389
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:13,800
That gives me hope for the world. I thought we were here to destroy it. You and I as two witnesses.

390
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:22,680
But that gives me hope, brah. And if anybody ever has anything bad about you, they can suck it

391
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:27,720
because you serve the muse, man. You bring back Hecateus. You're good. I love it.

392
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:33,480
You want to hear it? I got the passage from Plutarch right now. Plutarch says,

393
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:41,640
Moreover, the people believe that Amun is the name given to Zeus in the land of the Egyptians.

394
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:51,160
A name which we, with a slight alteration, hold on, you got to pause right there. Amun

395
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:57,880
with a slight alteration. He doesn't say what it is. It could be Amen. It could be Amzin.

396
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,680
He says slight alteration. Okay, remember that.

397
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:12,040
Pronounce Amun. But Menatho of Sabentus thinks that the meaning concealed or concealment

398
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:18,920
lies in the word. Hecateus of Abdera says the Egyptians use this expression, remember,

399
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:25,240
the altered form of Amun. So it's not Amun. It's an altered form of Amun. Like, come on,

400
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:30,360
dude, we have a slam dunk right here. I mean, let me finish this off. Egyptians express that

401
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:38,120
whenever they call to anyone for the word is a form of address, when they therefore

402
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:46,840
address the supreme God whom they believe to be the same as the universe as if he were invisible

403
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:54,920
and concealed and implore him to make himself visible and manifest, they use the alteration of

404
00:49:54,920 --> 00:50:04,120
Amun. So great then was the circumspection of the Egyptians in their wisdom, touching that he has

405
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:11,000
to do with all the gods. And I've showed this to a couple of different academics and some of them

406
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,760
are like, wow, that's interesting. I think you're on to something. But I've never, it's just nobody,

407
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:24,040
it's like, that's it. It just ends there. Nobody's, everybody said, what does Amen mean? Oh, so,

408
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:29,800
it means so be it. It means so be it. According to who? Because that's, that's a later rendition.

409
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:38,280
Show me an ancient source before the Septuagint or before Christianity, where someone says that Amen

410
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:44,200
means so be it. What is your opinion now? You don't hear that until later. What's your opinion of

411
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:48,840
modern scholars? You've been interviewing them a bunch and you've had a whole, how about everything

412
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:56,600
from Harvard to, to whatever all over the place? What is your opinion? I don't want to come off as like,

413
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:03,960
some cocky amateur in my, in my house that's not these, these are I have respect for scholars,

414
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,880
because they put in the work and they are trained. But sometimes they're like this,

415
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:13,560
they only are looking at the thing that they're trained in. And they don't realize that some of

416
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:18,360
their stuff is overlapping. And some of these stuff, some of these scholars are overlapping with them.

417
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:22,200
And some of these scholars are, and they can't see it. That's why me and Derek try to bring

418
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:26,600
these scholars on together. Hey, look, you're looking at this. Hey, you're looking at this.

419
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:31,480
Look, here's two different pieces to a bigger puzzle. Not saying that I, not saying that I

420
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,480
know everything. And I'm not saying that at all. But I'm saying, I'm just saying my experience

421
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:40,760
was sometimes they can be like that. But I have respect for scholars. I love, they're, they're,

422
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:46,200
they're, they're brilliant people. Oh, of course, of course. But yeah, and I, that's what I'm,

423
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:51,000
that's all I'm getting at. I don't, if I can say it just for your audience.

424
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:59,640
I don't have any respect for scholars, especially the ones from the Ivy League,

425
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:05,960
especially the ones from the Ivy League. And it's not just me that thanks it. I have friends who

426
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:10,920
are professors. Well, you were a professor. You feel the same way. Yeah. And that's where I learned

427
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:16,440
as being a professor in going to international meetings. It's hilarious now. I went to,

428
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:23,160
I went to an international meeting in London and the London, I think we got bust up the Newcastle.

429
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:28,040
I can't remember where the actual meeting was, but the London Times came and of everybody's,

430
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:33,800
they, they watched and came to mind and said, this is the last frontier of classics,

431
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:40,040
because I was talking about drugs and I was talking about the pharmacological side. And

432
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:46,120
I fought for years against these classicists. Look, look at these texts. Somebody just opened

433
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:53,560
this text. You know, classicists mostly refuse to go to the New Testament. I don't know if you've

434
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:59,320
noticed it, but you, you're a religious studies scholars and whatnot. They're not classical

435
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:05,480
philologists. No. Classical philologists do not like to mess with the New Testament,

436
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:10,920
because they know, oh, there's a whole another group here who thinks they own the water, right?

437
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:16,200
It's like contested water. And if you go over there, China's going to shoot you with a missile or

438
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:23,000
something, right? So don't go over there. But yeah, Neil, if you can get these people to start

439
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:29,240
looking at it, like I would love to ask, why, why does nobody talk about the naked boy? I would

440
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:37,000
love to see you get with somebody from Harvard. You know, you just ask them straight out, a naked boy

441
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:42,840
seriously. Well, this is the thing. This is what, this is the thing about this. The God, everyone

442
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:49,320
agrees that the gospel of Mark is written where there's no, there's no extra fat. It's the shortest

443
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:54,360
of the gospels. It gets straight to the point. There is no extra biblical, there's no extra.

444
00:53:55,320 --> 00:54:01,240
And they, it was five, like there's no extra information. Everything that Mark says has

445
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:09,080
some reason why it's there. Every, every syllable is there for a reason. So the fact that a little

446
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:13,640
boy runs away naked is not just like, I would just ignore that part. Just an extra information. No,

447
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:18,360
no, no, no, no, no, no. Mark is saying something here. We need to stop and look at it. What is

448
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:24,520
Mark trying to say? Not only that, not only that, Neil, I think that's a brilliant point, like something

449
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:29,880
that I would expect to, you know, that's what a scholar, you're doing what a scholar would do.

450
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:36,040
They're not doing their job. So you're doing it. You're exactly right about the concision of Mark.

451
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:42,200
I would take it even further and say, you've got more evidence because there is a much greater

452
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:48,840
concentration of Orphic mystery terminology in Mark than there is anywhere else. Almost

453
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:56,120
like you can take those areas that have that radiation, that Orphic radiation, and you can see

454
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:03,160
that other authors were saying, oh, we have to include this, but I'm going to blow it up into

455
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:09,800
something else. Right. You can, if you take a purple pen and you outline everything in the

456
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:17,480
Gospels that has to do with the mystery performance, you're going to see what's left over is the

457
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:24,680
garbage. Right. It's the, you can see consistently, if there's one thing we can say about Jesus,

458
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:33,240
just from an evidentiary standpoint, is the dude was way deep in a cult and he was way deep in a

459
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:41,720
mainstream death and resurrection mystery cult involving drugs and sex. Okay. If there's one

460
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:49,080
thing we can say from all of those purple markers, right, it's that. And I don't know,

461
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:54,120
do you ever get the sense that your guys in religious studies don't want to look at Jesus,

462
00:55:54,120 --> 00:56:01,240
the Magus? Well, you know, I, so this is something that I've discussed with a lot of people is that

463
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:06,840
in religious studies in particular, just in religious studies, not in classicists and not

464
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:13,000
in, and not in full up, a lot of people, a lot of American biblical studies is

465
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:20,840
steered by the seminaries, by the churches, by the evangelical, the THD people,

466
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:27,640
not the THD, the THD people, the theology degree people. They're guiding the ship of biblical

467
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:32,920
in a lot of ways they are. I'm not saying that they had all the control, I'm not saying that it's

468
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:38,840
some, there's like a conspiracy to, you know, keep Christianity afloat. But I will say that there is

469
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:46,440
a lot of influencing by people with an agenda. And it's my personal opinion, feel free to disagree

470
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:52,200
in the comments. But that's how I see it right now. Do you think they've, this is something new,

471
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:58,760
or you think they've been doing this kind of crap for the last, I don't know, maybe 1600 years or

472
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:04,600
somewhere, somewhere around the times that Julian, the emperor, whom we both love, right? Neil's a

473
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:11,720
huge Julian fan, right? So am I. When that Christian soldier threw that spear into his back, fighting

474
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:17,560
over there with the Parthians. That was the, you were telling me just the other day about the

475
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:23,240
video about Julian. And I got to that part in his story. I had to take a stop and take a right,

476
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:31,480
like this changed history for the worst in my opinion. Because Julian was trying to bring back

477
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:37,880
that metropolitan Roman world where every city has their own God and every, everyone has the

478
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:43,560
right to worship their own God in their own way. And why did it take another 1500 years to get back

479
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:50,680
to that? And by the way, out of all people to rebuild and bring the Jews back to Jerusalem,

480
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:57,160
to where their temple is, he's the one that was going to do it. Julian was the last person that

481
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:03,960
said Jerusalem belongs to the Jews. And all the way up to 1948, no one did that, no Christian

482
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:09,240
emperor, no Christian emperor ever wanted to give Jerusalem back to the Jews. They wanted it for

483
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:17,800
themselves. But Julian was someone who understood that religion is personal. And so he's a hero,

484
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:24,920
in my opinion. We really lost a lot when Julian was taken down. Do you think that has anything to

485
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:32,040
do with the whole idea that they found Bacchic implements inside the temple and that temple

486
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:38,120
practice had become a, you know, there's a reason Plutarch, the priest of Apollo says

487
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:43,960
Judaism is Bacchic worship. And then he starts to talk about it in table talk, right? Then we lose

488
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:50,440
the rest of the document. As soon as he gets past the explains the pomegranates, he explains,

489
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:55,720
starts explaining the temple and what the priests are wearing and how it's all Bacchic.

490
00:58:55,960 --> 00:59:02,520
You know what I think? We're talking about these academics who, they'll read this

491
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:09,720
passages by Tacitus and this is nonsense. But I think Tacitus is down to something

492
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:19,560
because you have this God Sabatios. Sabatios is identified as a form of Bacchus. But some

493
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:23,800
people have pointed out that Sabatios might be related to, he's the god of the Sabbath.

494
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:30,600
So you had this Sabbath God, who's like Bacchus, but a little bit more different, a little more,

495
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:35,800
you know, a little more institutional. And there's, there's, it's quite possible

496
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:43,320
that Yahweh has some links to Sabatios. It's a Phrygian father God. You know, he's like a Zeus.

497
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:50,600
He's like a Saturn. He's like Yahweh. Yahweh, Yahweh of the Sabbath might be the Sabatios.

498
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,240
There might be some connection there. That's all I'm saying.

499
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:57,720
Aren't they always trying to run out people? They're like, pull down that temple where all the

500
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:03,320
sex stuff goes on and stuff like that. And they're trying to change. I don't understand.

501
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:09,640
It seems like that's the inner mysteries are when, when you get deeper into any religion,

502
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:14,760
the inner mysteries is always something like some phallus or something. Some in the middle of a

503
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:21,240
temple or the Holy of Holies is supposed to be, there's the phallus, you know, the, the, the sacred.

504
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:28,120
There's a reason, you know, there's a reason we need the virgin, right? And all of the, all of the

505
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:34,840
imagery around the, the virgin mother, people think the virgin mother started with Mary. It doesn't.

506
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:44,040
It doesn't, right? Neither does her power to carry the purple. The, the nurse that stuck her

507
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:51,480
fingers into Mary's vagina on the Coptic side pulls out the burning purple. It burns her hands,

508
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:59,640
right? There's some transfer, you know, you were talking about symbols and you were talking about

509
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:07,720
Rome and how important Rome is that Roman mystery is the foundation. That's why you look at the

510
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:15,400
apocalypse and you see Rome, right? The, the, the seven hills are there for a reason. It's because

511
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:23,480
they developed the mystery and Numa is taking it from this girl named Egeria, who apparently lives

512
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:31,080
for a thousand years, but looks like she's a teenager the whole time. And he takes those books

513
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:38,440
and he buries them, right? When he dies, he's like, she told me everything. The future of the city of

514
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:43,320
Rome, what would happen? And it was huts, you know, I mean, it was nothing, well, it was more than

515
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:50,360
huts, but, um, and they buried those books, right? And on his instructions as death, they dug them

516
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:55,720
up years later, took them to the Senate and the Senate was like, Oh my God, we have to get rid of

517
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:02,600
these things. So when the Christians come along and they're calling them civilists,

518
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:09,160
you know, it's, those traditions are not, there's a, there's a reason for Peter and Rome,

519
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:16,600
right? And it's a mystic reason. It's a mystic reason that goes right back to Jesus getting

520
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:25,560
arrested with that kid. It's not odd. Heracles has one, right? God himself has one. He's

521
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:29,720
got his boy. You know, they talk about in that dirty poetry that you were talking about,

522
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:36,280
they talk about what it is to pull a Ganymede. That means to drink out of a boy's anus.

523
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:43,160
The nectar. Yeah. I read that. I saw that go from straight toe. And this is like, these were like

524
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:49,400
popular porn, basically. It's like the ancient version of porn. And that's what they were,

525
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:54,920
and that's the imagery is like Zeus and Ganymede and Apollo and Hayekinth. And

526
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:59,800
there's a lot of that going on. And it's just, that's the, this is what we, this is the context

527
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:04,680
that I think should be mandatory for people to realize before they even look at these texts.

528
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:10,840
Yeah. Look what you've done too. Your audience should appreciate the fact that you have not

529
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:17,560
had the benefit of Harvard education, yet you are able to swim those currents and access that

530
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:24,760
information. And now you're, you're, you're going beyond where they're capable of going.

531
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:35,320
And that's, you know, that's amazing. I would have you in, as my trench warrior anytime, anytime.

532
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:41,640
The sources don't lie. Yeah. And here's the thing, even if the sources are wrong,

533
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:47,400
even when Herodotus tells a story that might not be true, there's something that story tells

534
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:53,080
us something about the time. Right. So when Herodotus is saying that there's one eyed men

535
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:57,480
in gold guarding griffins living in the North where the hyperboreans are, that might not be a

536
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:03,320
true statement, but it tells us of how the Greeks thought of the Scythians. They thought of a magical

537
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:09,640
fairy land up there and it was dark and there's forests were scary and there was monsters creeping

538
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:15,400
out. That's how the Greeks thought of the, the North. Herodotus captures that. That's why I'm

539
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:20,440
saying even the primary sources, even if they're not true, they're, they tell us more about the

540
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:27,720
context of the time than any modern theory can tell us. There's a, there's a dragon that guards a

541
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:35,320
tree. Everybody knows about him. It's in the grove of Mars and on the tree hangs a skin,

542
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:43,960
right, of a ram and on it is written the sacred song. Right. That's the cibulations. They're

543
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:51,720
all captured there and that dude walks around. He's blind. First of all, but he walks around

544
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:58,200
with poison that he can spit. He can use on arrows. He can do whatever he wants. And if you get near

545
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:04,760
it, he'll kill you immediately. The Greeks couldn't conquer. They went to, they went to Troy with all

546
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:09,720
their big fights and we know about Bronze Age combat. We can put the limny and steel up here,

547
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:15,800
you know, harkening back to the Bronze Age with the combat. Yeah, but what's really, what's really

548
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:23,800
courageous? What's really courageous? It's Odysseus with his arrow poison. Having Cersei put him into

549
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:30,600
a death state and you didn't know that. You're like, what? That's not part of the, of the Odyssey.

550
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:38,120
Yes, it is. Cersei, like Jesus, turns a bunch of soldiers into pigs. Right. She raises from the

551
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:45,240
dead. Did you know she says, John Tsitsi says in lycophron is indicating the resurrection

552
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:55,000
of Odysseus. Odysseus is Jesus a long time, a millennium before Jesus was millennium.

553
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,840
He was the hero of the Greeks. That's what everybody thought of. He was the example.

554
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:07,160
What you're getting at is so true. And in fact, Derek Lambert was in the chat. I saw, he left

555
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:13,640
the comment asking if you've seen Dennis McDonald's, Dennis McDonald's. So Dennis McDonald's put

556
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:21,080
together all of the mimesis from Homer. That's in the Gospels. And so I want to just give you one

557
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:27,480
example. Just, just to get your reaction. It's about Cersei too, by the way. And I just want to,

558
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:31,720
if you don't mind, I just want to get your reaction. I think you really appreciate this.

559
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:35,800
I really do. I really think you will. So Dennis McDonald put this together. Look at this. Can

560
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:40,760
you read this or not? I'll read it to you if you can't see it. Yeah. No, I got it. Odysseus in his

561
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:46,920
crew sailed to the land of the Cyclops and of Cersei. Jesus and his disciples sailed to the

562
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:51,640
region of the garrisons. All right. So we have two people, two different stories, people sailing.

563
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:55,880
You might be, all right. That's not a big deal. But let's look at the sequence here. On the mountains

564
01:06:55,880 --> 01:07:03,080
of the Cyclops is innumerable goats grazed. Cersei turned soldiers into swine. On the mountain,

565
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:08,920
now back to Mark. On the mountain, a large herd of swine grazed. Okay. Odysseus and his crew

566
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:15,080
disembarked. Jesus and his crew disembarked, the same Greek word. They encounter a savage,

567
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:22,360
lawless giant who lived in a cave. Jesus encounters a savage, lawless demoniac who lived among the

568
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:31,720
caves. Polyphemus usually was depicted nude. The demoniac was nude. Now Cersei recognizes Odysseus

569
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:39,640
and asks him not to harm her. Swear an oath. Orcon, not to plan another plot to hurt me.

570
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:47,400
The giant Ask Odysseus intended to harm. The demoniac recognizes Jesus and uses that same

571
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:55,080
root word, orcidso, right? Is that how you say it? Orquico? Orquizo, yes. Orquizo. You not to

572
01:07:55,080 --> 01:08:00,840
torment me. So we have, all right. So we have these, the sequence of events is lining up here.

573
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:07,560
Let's keep going. The giant asks Odysseus his name. Jesus asks the demoniac his name. Odysseus

574
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:15,800
answers, nobody is my name. The demoniac answers Jesus. Legion is my name. Odysseus subdues the

575
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:22,200
giant with violence and trickery. Cersei's magic turned Odysseus's soldiers into swine.

576
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Jesus subsdues 2,000 demons with divine power and sent them into the swine and drove the swine

577
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:37,960
into a lake. This is lining up perfectly. Polyphemus, the shepherd calls out to his neighbors.

578
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:43,320
The swine herds call out to their neighbors. The Cyclops is coming and the site asking Polyphemus

579
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:49,320
for stolen sheep. The garrisons come to the site to find out about their swine. Odysseus and his

580
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:55,400
crew embark. Jesus and his crew embark. And Odysseus tells the giant's proclaim that he had

581
01:08:55,400 --> 01:09:02,440
blinded him. Jesus tells the healed demoniac to proclaim what God had done for him. Now this is

582
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:09,800
just so, it's the same story being retold through a different lens, through a different time,

583
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:14,840
through a different character. Odysseus and Jesus. You also had the idea of Jesus's feet

584
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:21,800
being anointed by Eurycleia. Jesus' feet are being anointed by Mary and then he says to her,

585
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:29,320
you're famed we told far and wide, which Eurycleia, the girl who anointed Odysseus' feet,

586
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:35,400
that name Eurycleia in Greek means famed far and wide. Jesus is only putting a pun on the name.

587
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:41,800
It's too much. It's too good. I thought you'd get a kick out of that.

588
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:47,800
Yeah, no, I get a big kick out of that. I like to stay in the shallow waters that are just

589
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:54,120
linguistic. So I'm thinking about his use of the verb there. I'm not impressed with the boarding

590
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:59,880
and the turn of phrases that are the same. I can do that with a whole bunch of texts. It doesn't

591
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:08,840
mean they're related. But the content of the progression of the narrative is you have to,

592
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:16,360
I have to agree, there's a lot of overlap there. It's the sequence of the events that line up.

593
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:21,080
They're not scared. They're lined up the sequence. You know what I mean? What if, Neil,

594
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:29,320
there's also a connection with the, for example, Jason, right? Jason, yeah, his name is Iason.

595
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:35,080
It is, I keep telling people this, it is the name Jesus and they don't, because they want to say no,

596
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:43,400
it's Joshua. And I want to say no, because this name is part of a religious right that predates.

597
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:48,680
It goes all the way back to Mycenaeus. Bronze Age, right? So it's not coming from the Hebrew.

598
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:56,280
It can't be. There is none. And to add to what you're saying, both of the roots of those words

599
01:10:56,280 --> 01:11:03,400
have to do with healing. Jason Healer, Joshua, even Joshua in Hebrew has to do with healing.

600
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:07,240
So they're both, both of these words are coming from a common source.

601
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:14,680
I think that's what that Pulaskean is. I think that, I don't think it's that the Jews didn't have it.

602
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:19,720
I think it's that, just like the Egyptians, the Egyptians that absorbed it from 3000 BC.

603
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:24,200
Mediterranean language, all overlapping, all the Mediterranean languages.

604
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:30,840
And Neil and I are not just making up these Pulaskeans. These are a real people. And the

605
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:36,200
Georgians will tell you, these are the early Georgians who's, you know, anyway, good stuff.

606
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:40,280
After the Bronze Age collapse, it's the Pulaskeans that are populated in the Mediterranean.

607
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:45,480
It makes you think if there's some kind of movement, some of those migrations

608
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:53,080
cause that sudden change in the population. I don't know, because I mean, why are they calling

609
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:58,360
them Autochthonous, right? Why is everybody referring to them as the original people?

610
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:05,080
When we talk about Jewish migration, that's not unusual, right? It's, we watch, we sit down, Neil,

611
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:11,160
and we watch our, our, Charlton Heston, every Easter. We're about to have him come out.

612
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:15,960
And for all I know, he's doing it tonight. And he's spreading his arms and he's making

613
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:21,800
the seed part, right? We're moving these people, right? Guess what? These migrations happen all

614
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:30,760
the time, right? So this is a dynamic of the world. It wasn't that Jehovah is Jewish, right?

615
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:36,200
This is coming through. When Jehovah tells Moses, he's like, set up this tent and you're

616
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:41,320
going to go in this tent. My voice will be there. Boom. It's a Talistarian.

617
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:47,800
The second voice of God, right? Right. He's, he's working from tradition. He's not bringing

618
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:53,640
them out ex nihilo. That's what I'm saying. This, this was a, the way they, the way Leviticus

619
01:12:54,520 --> 01:13:00,200
just prescribes how the priest is supposed to come in and, you know, sacrifice the bull

620
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:06,280
and sprinkle the blood seven times on the altar. These are straight from the ancient pagan world

621
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:12,120
on how to get an oracle from a different God, any God. Yeah. Whatever you set up their tent,

622
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:19,560
you set up their, their, their oracle with, with the, with the altar the same way. So the way,

623
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:24,680
the way they're worshiping Jehovah is no different than somebody in Phrygia is worshiping

624
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:31,800
Sabazios or somebody in the, in Libya worshiping Ammon. They're all doing it the same way.

625
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:39,000
Yes. And that Neil is what this letter of Pseudo-Clement mentions. It says they're showing them

626
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:45,000
the attitum. That's that space that you're trying to preserve for the oracle. You're

627
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:53,320
performing the mystery, right? So I don't know why Christians don't put more value and actually

628
01:13:53,320 --> 01:14:00,440
looking at what their texts are saying, right? Rather than reading everything through the last

629
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:08,600
16, well, the last 1800 years of Christianity. They're afraid of being like a pagan.

630
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:14,760
Yeah. Like, why? That's if you want to do religion, do it right. Yeah. These are, these are ancient

631
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:21,160
traditions that are going back to before we had writing. And it's the same, it's the same traditions,

632
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:27,080
you know, evolving basically, evolving over time. So what are you scared of? It's the same. It's,

633
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:32,280
you're just following the history, you know, I would love to tell every Christian in the group,

634
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:39,960
if I could address every Christian out there and tell them, I've been to the texts and I can tell

635
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:49,560
you there is no such thing as eternal life. It does not exist. What Jesus himself promised

636
01:14:51,160 --> 01:15:00,760
was Ionic life. And Ionic life is a place within the operation of the mystery.

637
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:07,400
So he was saying, straight up, get the same phrase in the Orphic. What is that,

638
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:15,160
that papyrus, devouring papyrus? And I proclaim Ionic life. Orphi says it.

639
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:21,880
It's the ion, right? And Christians don't get that because they hear just through an accident of

640
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:29,080
history and the translating. And it wasn't so accidental because the church fathers had a lot

641
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:36,200
of poll on how we'll set our doctrine and our ideas. And as soon as you get doctrine and ideas,

642
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:42,280
you're, excuse me, you're live, so I'm not going to be rude about it, but you're in a bad place.

643
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:48,680
Your vision is obscured from the actual evidence because that's what we get in the actual evidence.

644
01:15:49,400 --> 01:16:00,120
So there's no salvation, right? There is the soter. There is the soteria. And the first soteria

645
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:10,360
is described in the Orphic hymns to this female divinity who is a virgin mother, right? So you

646
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:16,920
can see how the Orphics would be able to grasp. She's also the light bringer, the Luciferia.

647
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:24,040
Exactly. Right? The light bringer, which is what they call Diana up in the Crimea. People were

648
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:28,920
like asking the other day on the channel, where's the Diana of Nemus? Where is she from in Italy and

649
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:33,720
all that next, you know, we're talking about the lake and all that kind of stuff. All this stuff

650
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:43,080
is coming from that Diana who lives in the Crimea. And she has the right of sacrifice. Any stranger

651
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:51,880
that washes the shore, she kills them. She kills them in a right. Why? Because she was killed

652
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:59,240
in a right. They're perpetuating the same priesthood. So, and for those of you who are Christians,

653
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:04,840
the mystery is not a question. It's not a secret. The mystery is an operation

654
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:13,720
that these religions are doing. It is a practice. So when you hear mystery and Paul the Apostle is

655
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:20,280
talking about mystery, you are not hearing what they were saying. I tell this to my seminarians

656
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:26,280
every year because I feel bad. Feel bad for the Christians. I tell them, I say, you have not read

657
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:33,000
the Bible. You think you have, but you have not. Neil knows that once you start looking at the Greek,

658
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:37,800
then it all of a sudden opens up and I'm not talking about the stuff that comes canned

659
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:42,920
out of a seminary. I'm not talking that. I'm talking about the stuff that you need that'll

660
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:48,280
allow you to read ancient medical texts or ancient epics or anything like this.

661
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:55,080
This is, this is Kalamikis, Kalimakis written around the same time as the Septuagint was

662
01:17:55,080 --> 01:18:02,520
translated, right? So it's that Alexandrian 3rd century BCE Greek. In here, there's a hymn to

663
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:11,240
Artemis. So this is, we're talking, and it says, she is quoting her saying, I want to be a virgin

664
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:20,760
forever and let me be the light bringer, Luciferia. The virgin light bringer, Soteria, a savior,

665
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:27,640
virgin, light bringer, all these tropes that you see with the Christ. It's already being

666
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:36,520
applied to these other gods way before Diana, who's Artemis, is a savior, virgin, goddess.

667
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:44,680
It's just, this is all, this is, it's, this is the way religion is done. Christianity can just

668
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:49,240
pop up out of nowhere and start this new thing that no one's heard of before and no one's done.

669
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:57,080
This is the, this is business as usual. Nothing different is going on here. Just, this became the

670
01:18:57,080 --> 01:19:01,960
religion of the West, became the Roman Empire's state religion. So everybody thinks it's special

671
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:06,520
now, but like, it could have been, it could have been any of these, any of these traditions that

672
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:14,760
made it that way. You know? They called it the way. They called it the way. Oh, don't, oh, don't.

673
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:22,680
Yep. Yeah. And that's what, when you're walking it, when you're engaging that mystery,

674
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:28,760
you understand. And it puts you in a place where when he said Soteria, when he said salvation,

675
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:35,640
people would have understood, right? And then what's really creepy, what's really creepy,

676
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:41,000
you know, everything about this, that says that there are certain things that we have to deny,

677
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:47,880
right? Certain things we have to deny. I don't want you telling people. When Jesus is talking,

678
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:54,040
preaching, you get your funny Western vision of him standing on the hill in his sheet, right?

679
01:19:54,040 --> 01:20:00,040
And he's not like this and he's like, my people, you know, blessed are the meek, right?

680
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:10,360
Wait a minute. Is this the same Jesus who walks around speaking in analog so that people won't

681
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:15,160
understand what he's saying? It's not so that they will. Jesus doesn't walk around saying,

682
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:21,000
I'm going to give you an example. It's a metaphor for you to figure out, right? So it'll further

683
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:27,880
explain what I'm saying. He doesn't say that. It says he purposely kept them. It's so that the

684
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:35,960
people who are outside, those who are not initiated, remember, he is a mystagogue. The letter says,

685
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:43,800
Jesus, the mystagogue, it's in there. So what do we, you know, he fits the profile perfectly.

686
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:48,760
And you got the hero fan thing, too. Yeah, yeah. All the titles that he's getting,

687
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:54,120
in the revelation, the author of the revelation calls him Lucifer. Yeah. Calls him the son of

688
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:59,400
the morning, the dawn. That's Lucifer. Right. He's the morning star. He's the morning star. He's

689
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:04,920
getting all the same titles. He's getting all these mystery religion titles. Yeah. Yeah. So if

690
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:10,040
he is, and if, you know, in the book of revelation, a lot of Christians don't realize it, but in the

691
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:21,720
book of revelation, he's wearing a woman's nightie. He's wearing a bra that is made for a woman. And

692
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:29,560
it says it's around his breasts. And it's the Greek word for the feminine breasts. Has it been used

693
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:34,200
for males before? That's where people are like, wait a minute, wait a minute. But the thing that

694
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:42,040
he puts around them that, that it's usually translated as girdle, that's a part of his kit

695
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:47,800
that is the morning star's kit. And the morning star is originally a woman. The morning star is

696
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:57,240
originally Urania. And so if Urania, the morning star has this kingdom, and the word Urania there

697
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:03,560
is the word for heaven, right? She is the one in charge of the heavenly kingdom. Jesus is just

698
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:10,360
taking that machinery and bringing it to himself. Does it make sense then that he has to be with the

699
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:17,240
naked boy at four a.m.? Yeah, because he's deriving an antidote for a cup that apparently at the time

700
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:24,600
he doesn't want to take. He knows how crazy this is, what they're doing. Right. He says that in the

701
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:31,080
same chapter he says, take this cup away from me. No one knows what he's talking about. It's all

702
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:38,200
there in chapter 14. He just brought it back full circle to me. All the language is there. So if you

703
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:45,240
were some, if you were an Alexandrian initiates in the first century, and someone brought this text

704
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:49,160
marked to you, you're reading 14, you would, you would know exactly what this is. You would say,

705
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:55,320
I know what's going on here. There wouldn't be this big question like we're here today in 2023.

706
01:22:55,960 --> 01:23:03,560
No, no, no. The Greek ear of the first century would know what this is. They would understand

707
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:08,520
right away. And if you weren't in the group, you weren't initiated. Maybe you weren't one of those

708
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:14,360
boys that went through the process, but you were on the outside, and you knew this is a thing about

709
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:21,480
hearing, you know, and there's code. And you saw Romans coming into Alexandria, arresting

710
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:28,680
Christians for taking little kids off the street. Right. They're arresting Christians

711
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:37,640
for abducting and abusing children. Right. If you didn't have ears to hear, you'd be like those

712
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:44,920
cultists. Right. Well, you'd know, you'd know this is part of the deal. And people don't realize

713
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:51,560
my religion, the religion that I'm trying to replace my democracy with its deocracy,

714
01:23:51,560 --> 01:24:00,440
that is built upon pederasty. It is built upon dudes getting arrested in public parks

715
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:05,960
at 4am and saying, why are you coming at me with all the weapons? I'm not dealing any kids here.

716
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:15,480
Dude, that's such, that's exactly what it is, man. That's crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Somebody actually

717
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:21,400
super chatted before you even brought up the secret mark chat GPT. Thanks for the super chat.

718
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:26,280
It's the same kid from the secret gospel of mark. This is before you even brought that up. So

719
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:33,080
kudos to chat GPT for being on it like that. Yeah. That's a good point. But um, yeah, this was

720
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:38,440
draw. Oh, snappy. Oh, thank you for the super chat. Love you guys. Please talk about what happens

721
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:45,160
in the sacred groves. Ammon gives us the mystery all the best. This is what it's all about. Because

722
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:51,240
we didn't even mention this. We're in the sacred grove to begin with this chapter. They go to get

723
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:58,040
sent me. That's a sacred grove. I've been there. I've been to Israel. I went to the Garden of

724
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:03,880
the Assembly. You know what's right next to it? A giant cemetery. It's a sacred grove. You don't

725
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:12,520
a sacred grove is a garden next to a cemetery. Period. They're in the sacred grove and snappy is

726
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:21,720
onto something here because mystery cults perform their rights oftentimes in a sacred grove. Yes.

727
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:28,120
And that Timonus that right that Timonus that place that you cut, it's literally the place that you

728
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:36,840
cut off from the what we would call the secular world, right? It's the place where that divinity

729
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:43,160
and all those places they have some source or some power. It's usually like a spring when Numa

730
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:53,640
whose name if you were to write it in Etruscan would say amen. When Numa went to his meetings

731
01:25:53,640 --> 01:26:03,320
with Nigeria, the thousand year old purple using Etruscan Wates priestess who they say came.

732
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:10,040
Anyway, divine. They talk about a divinity. When he when he was doing his thing, it's the same

733
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:20,840
process, right? That they're entering into and that power he goes to he goes to Nigeria at a sacred

734
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:31,640
place at a place with a little spring, right? A garden. It's sometimes described as a garden.

735
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:37,320
Yeah. And it still exists. We have the niche in Rome where this was.

736
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:44,520
Gorgeous. Love it. But yeah, he's there in this cemetery. Notice every time he's getting caught

737
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:51,000
is in the cemetery. Even Cyprian, you know, comes stumbles out of the cemetery with the

738
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:59,880
says the venom coming out of his bottom out of his anus, right? Those places, those burials,

739
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:07,880
you know, those those wild centers, right? Yeah, this Garden of Gethsemane is a real,

740
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:14,520
you know, it's a real place to hang out with with naked boys. I mean, that's this is me.

741
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:19,960
When I was in Israel, I took got some footage of the garden and there's Christians flocking

742
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:24,680
around. Obviously Christians from all over the all over the world flocking here. That's

743
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:29,720
and supposedly in a thousand year old tree or whatever. But I was more interested and I want

744
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:32,840
to know what's going on inside this church right next to it. They build right next to it. It's a

745
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:38,600
Catholic church they got. And sure enough, they have the image of the arrest right in the middle

746
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:44,040
of the church is the image of the arrest. They had the different scenes going on. There's him

747
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:49,880
sitting there. And then look, they have there's there's the arrest right there. And there's

748
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:57,720
your there's your boy right there. So this is there this they got this place in they have a

749
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:05,160
church built all based on chapter 14. It's all the scenes of chapter 14 are on the walls in the

750
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:10,440
church. How come my kids not naked, Neil? He's supposed to be naked. You know, you know, they

751
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:14,520
would never that's that's revealing. That's probably in the that's probably in the back room.

752
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:23,400
They probably have that. That's the inner mystery. See how powerful it is. If you control the text

753
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:29,400
and you control the information, you can tell anybody anything you want. Neil, you were telling

754
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:35,640
me the other day, you were saying, Hey, there's this Antikythera thing, this computer thing

755
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:41,800
that the big school working out and then tons of dark ages that follow it. You know, it makes you

756
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:46,200
wonder. I think I just want to bring up your point. Oh, let me let me let me add to what you're

757
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:50,920
saying right now. Check this out. So I'm going to share my screen. I'm going to go over here.

758
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:57,240
And because no, this is such a good point. Antikythera mechanism. Okay, look at this.

759
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:06,440
This is a hand powered analog computer that used to predict astronomical positions

760
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:13,800
and eclipses decades in advance. Okay, this was received from a shipwreck and it's dated to the

761
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:21,640
third century BCE. Okay, second century BC. Sorry. All I'm saying is, if this is what the Greek world

762
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:31,800
was producing with paganism at the helm, why is it that it took a 2000 years after Christianity

763
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:40,440
rose out and became the central culture, as you will, where knowledge is considered evil?

764
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:45,320
Let's go right to Genesis one. The tree of knowledge is evil. You know, it's better to just

765
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:51,720
worship and pay your your 10% and, you know, you know, give all of our resources to the church and

766
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:56,440
let the church guide us through the as the light in the darkness. That was the way that people

767
01:29:56,440 --> 01:30:02,760
lived in Western society for 1500 years. And there is no no one building computers.

768
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:10,840
They were already doing this before that. So I'm arguing that Christianity kind of held

769
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:16,200
the world back a little bit. My night might disagree. Go ahead. You feel free to disagree

770
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:21,320
all you want. That's my personal opinion is that I think there would be a lot quicker

771
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:28,840
advancements if we let if the metropolitan way continued. That makes sense.

772
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:37,880
Yeah, we certainly wouldn't have been putting guys like Galileo in prison and whatnot. And

773
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:44,760
that's what I don't get, Neil. Why does the modern American audience not understand that this thing

774
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:51,880
that you relish and that you celebrate worship and love because you know, you do democracy.

775
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:58,280
You love this thing called democracy. And you don't realize it didn't come from Christianity.

776
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:06,680
Christianity overthrew democracy. It's spirit across the world. Christianity suppressed.

777
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:12,120
It was a thing back in the fourth century Athens, the fourth century BCE Athens.

778
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:17,960
It was a literally literal democracy, more democratic than we ever know.

779
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:25,640
Yeah, it's radical. It's radical, right? When you are there and you have the ability to make

780
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:31,880
the choice that you don't have somebody telling you, this is your God, right? The things were

781
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:39,080
like screw everything. We're worshiping a virgin and people are free. People are free here and

782
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:45,240
people say debate. Oh, well, to what degree did they have freedoms? Forget you. The fact

783
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:53,480
is, they were fighting for that freedom. And that freedom is the same thing. You find it again

784
01:31:53,480 --> 01:32:01,720
in this letter of Pseudo-Clement. He talks about the Eleutheria that is part of the mystery,

785
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:09,320
that complete unassailable freedom. And that is always, Bacchus is always protecting the virgin.

786
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:14,200
There's a reason and Athens is where that first theater is. People don't realize it. There are

787
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:21,240
no Christians that invented the theater. They didn't, doesn't happen, will never happen, right?

788
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:27,880
It was the Greeks who worshiped the virgin, who came up with democracy, who had the theater

789
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:35,720
constructed. And it was just a place to land the Bacchic procession. It was just a place to

790
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:41,480
land the Bacchic procession. That's where we get democracy. So when anybody stands up today and

791
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:50,600
tells you, God has blessed the USA, no, no, the virgin, right? The virgin has blessed us. Yeah,

792
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:54,840
yeah. We need to preserve that. We need to preserve that.

793
01:32:54,840 --> 01:33:00,360
Yeah. Could this have been a Paul teaching? Because Paul was more of a mystery teaching

794
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:11,080
than Joshua. Mark traveling with Paul. It's interesting. It's interesting. Maybe. I'm not

795
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:17,080
really, that's, what do you think? Do you have any opinion on that? I will. Neil, I'm going to be super

796
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:22,920
rude, but you know my contract with the devil. I can't discuss. I'm going to take a break and

797
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:30,280
you, because I understand, hey, everybody who's out there, no criticism. I understand this is

798
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:39,320
part of how this runs as a way to feed Neil and to keep his journalism, because this is better

799
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:45,800
than, this is not just YouTube show. This is journalism that you're doing. This is historical

800
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:51,160
journalism. I'm going to give you a chance to answer all of your, take a break and come back and

801
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:58,120
yeah, you're fine. I'll be back. I'll be back. All right. So now this is a good question, Durin.

802
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:07,560
I thought, because yeah, Paul, he has a lot of, the way Paul is interacting with the world that

803
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:15,560
he's living in, is he is extending his hand to the pagan world and saying, you know, if you're

804
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:21,480
with a people in a crowd and they're offering a, you know, they're offering to, you know, meet

805
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:30,360
sacrifice to idols, we're all Romans here. Let's, let's chill. Let's, let's relax. So yeah, you might

806
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:36,120
be on to something there. This might be a Pauline thing for all we know. I'm not sure the question

807
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:44,040
is how much is the gospel of Mark connected to Paul and maybe there's a big connection. Maybe

808
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:49,560
there isn't. That's where the question is. So that's what I would look into. That's a good question

809
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:56,200
though. I never thought about that. How much is Mark taking from Paul? Good question, actually.

810
01:34:56,200 --> 01:35:01,000
Really good question because we all, it's, it's already established that Mark comes after Paul.

811
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:09,880
So your, your question is, is a spot on. It deserves to be explored for sure.

812
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:19,640
Oh, let's see. The next one is from evangelicals never lie with a giant super chat. Wow.

813
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:28,280
Thank you. Thank you. I so appreciate this. Thank you that you did not have to do that.

814
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:32,600
And I appreciate it. And I really, really, I can't even say how much I appreciate it.

815
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:38,840
Ben, a while since I bought you don't says I bought you don't pissed me. Hold on.

816
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:42,440
Am I reading this right? Ben, a while since I bought you don't pissed.

817
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:48,680
Great stuff, dude. Very interesting. Well, I appreciate it so much. I really,

818
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:55,240
I can't even just words cannot describe how much I appreciate this. And uh,

819
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:59,880
yeah, I, you, you, and like, like, I don't know what type of before he left this.

820
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:05,560
You're the reason why I'm allowed to be doing this and drop daily videos. And I'm trying to

821
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:11,800
keep up that pace is just, I'm just working and you know, these, the days when I go live are

822
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:18,520
actually my days off from putting together like edited content. So the next video I have coming

823
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:23,800
out next, um, before I get to the next super chat, I just want to show you guys the next video.

824
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:28,360
I'll give, I'll actually, I'll show you my, um, thumbnail. That's what I'll do.

825
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:36,280
I'll show you the thumbnail, the thumbnail for my next video. Wait, do I even have it?

826
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:49,880
Um, maybe I don't have it with me. But anyways, the next video I'm doing is about Lucifer.

827
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:56,760
How does Lucifer become Satan? You're probably asking, what do you mean Satan is Lucifer?

828
01:36:56,760 --> 01:37:03,000
No, no, no, no, no Lucifer started off as a totally different thing is from the Roman religion side.

829
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:10,280
Lucifer is Lucifer is the male version of Venus. How does Lucifer become Satan?

830
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:17,720
And how does Lucifer become the devil? How does Satan become the devil? All of that.

831
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:20,840
There's a, there's a three different questions that are being asked. There's aren't the same

832
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:28,680
Satan is in the, and there's a Jewish context of Satan being the accuser. There's also this root

833
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:34,200
word of set. There's also this different devil characters. There's also underworld gods like

834
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:41,000
Pluto and Hades. And then there's Lucifer, who's a light bringer who's not evil at all.

835
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:45,160
And then you also have fallen gods that get in trouble like Prometheus.

836
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:49,720
You have Apollo getting in trouble and falling down to earth and being,

837
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:55,560
so you have these different traditions. And that's my next video coming out next.

838
01:37:55,560 --> 01:38:02,760
How does Lucifer become the devil? And Chthonius is, this is the last super chat I'm on, so you

839
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:08,840
don't have to, you can chill for this one. Chthonius says, if Jesus would have succeeded,

840
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:16,920
what would have happened to the boy, Ganymede, or sacrifice or initiate, would he have been holy?

841
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:25,000
Wow. Chthonius, Chthonius is going deep into the mysteries. I know Chthonius personally,

842
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:33,160
and this is someone who really, really likes to study this stuff. So, um, yeah, if Jesus would

843
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:41,160
have happened to the boy, Ganymede, or sacrifice or initiate, would he have been holy? Yeah,

844
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:47,880
right? Isn't that how that works? I'm guessing. Christine Wilson, next for the Super Sticker.

845
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:51,400
Appreciate you so much. Appreciate you so much. Amon, what do you think about all this?

846
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:58,920
I just came back to the devil. I heard you talking about the devil, and I love it, Neil.

847
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:04,280
That's the video that I'm coming out with, either tomorrow, let me just say, actually,

848
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:09,320
it won't be ready by tomorrow morning, but it might be ready by tomorrow evening. If not by

849
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:17,080
tomorrow evening, the next, the 21st morning, Tuesday morning, that video will be done.

850
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:25,560
Promise that. And it's, when does Lucifer become the devil? And it's deep, I'm going deep into

851
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:33,160
this one, because there's a lot of explaining to do. It's not simple. Yeah. Bring the dawn,

852
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:41,080
brother. Bring the dawn. Yeah. Yeah. Love it. Love it. People are shocked when they find out the

853
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:47,560
venous, you know, is the devil. People are kind of shocked at first. I don't know. You get down

854
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:54,520
there and she's got a skirt on, right? And you may think one way, you may have been taught one

855
01:39:54,520 --> 01:40:00,760
tradition, but when you get down there, the devil and realize as you lift up that Mediterranean

856
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:14,360
short skirt, there is a large penis there. This is, this is Venus, the mother of the Roman people,

857
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:22,680
right? It's fantastic. And to go even deeper than that, because you know how in the Greek religion,

858
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:31,000
when you have two gods that, that, that mates, have sex, whatever, and create an offspring,

859
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:37,160
God, oftentimes those two, it's, it's, there's a reason for the genealogy. You have two different

860
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:46,760
priesthoods coming together. Venus and Dionysus have an offspring. You know exactly where I'm

861
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:51,320
going with this. Yeah. Go for it. Sing it, brother. This is one of the most important mystery,

862
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:59,560
religion gods of the ancient world. And it's hermaphrodite. So it's, no, no, as it hermes,

863
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:07,080
I'm sorry, is it hermes and aphrodite, not, not Bacchus. Yeah. Hermes and aphrodite created God

864
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:16,600
named hermaphrodite. Hermaphroditis. Hermaphroditis. Okay, thank you. And this is, this was a very

865
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:22,920
important deity in the ancient world of the mystery religions, because you're bringing together these,

866
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:32,760
these, you have the angelos. The word angel comes from angelos, messenger. Hermes was the logos.

867
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:40,200
He was the word of Zeus, the messenger. He was an angel. He was the angelos. And he

868
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:48,760
creates with aphrodite, who's Venus, the Luciferia, the Lightbringer, this goddess, Hermaphroditas.

869
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:55,480
So you have this important genealogies happening in the Greek, in the, because there's a deeper

870
01:41:55,480 --> 01:42:02,040
meaning behind this stuff. Like for example, Thanes, this is going to get crazy right now.

871
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:09,800
You're about to say it's about to get crazy. Thanes is the, is the, the primordial being

872
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:16,920
that comes from chaos. He's the beginning. He's the, he's the, the highest God there is.

873
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:24,520
And then from Thanes, you get Eros and Nix. What is this? What is this? Come on, don't just jump out

874
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:30,600
like that. Tell us, what did Zeus do to Thanes? What did he do to him?

875
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:36,680
It's an orphic, in the orphic fragments. Remember that you were looking at?

876
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:42,920
Yeah. He, he, he blows them. Yes. Yeah. I was, I was getting there. I was getting there.

877
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:48,520
I was going to get, oh, I'm sorry. No, no, no. That's what I'm saying. Thanes. So there's,

878
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:55,720
there's weird, there is this secret mystery religion language about Thanes where they'll say

879
01:42:55,720 --> 01:43:01,960
Thanes is Bacchus or Bacchus is Thanes. And then they'll say, this is in the Durveni

880
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:10,280
Papyrus, by the way, that Zeus was there from the beginning. Okay. That's weird. He's the,

881
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:15,400
he's the beginning and the end, the Alphan Omega. Oh, that's weird. Then it says that Thanes is

882
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:21,160
Priapus. So like, normal, any normal person's scratching their head going, what's going on here?

883
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:25,640
Why is, why are all these gods the same person? Why are they all mixed together? Well, it's because

884
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:33,800
that original light that came out of chaos, which is Thanes, when, when Thanes gives birth to

885
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:40,840
the next generation and it goes down to Saturn or to our nose, who is the heaven god, then to Saturn,

886
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:48,120
then to Zeus, then to Bacchus. And then Bacchus has a child with Venus, who's Priapus. They all

887
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:53,960
had that spark of Thanes within them. So when Zeus is the beginning and the end, they're talking

888
01:43:53,960 --> 01:44:00,040
about Thanes. When, when, when Priapus is being called Thanes, when Bacchus is being called the

889
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:05,080
divine child, the savior, the king of all the universe. And you're like, wait a minute, I thought

890
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:09,400
that was the title for Saturn. That's because they're all had the spark of Thanes in them.

891
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:13,880
And that's deep right there. That's what that means.

892
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:21,960
It's Jehovah. I'm so hot now, Neil. I'm so hot. You just brought up Jehovah. And it's just, it's

893
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:27,960
like, oh, let's look at him and see, and see him for what he is. You know what I mean? He's sucking

894
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:36,280
the Edoian, right? That Zeus goes in and sucks that Edoian, right? It doesn't, it, you know,

895
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:44,840
don't let it surprise you. All these tyrant gods are subservient to the, the, the, the Thanes, the,

896
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:51,080
the primordial chaos, the light and the darkness, the lightbringer, the Lucifer. They're all

897
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:57,240
subservient to that. They're always bound to fail. People don't realize the poles are flipped,

898
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:06,200
right? And the good guy who brings you reason and doesn't lie to you is the one that years

899
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:14,280
saying is the devil, right? When it's your Jehovah who is destined to fall.

900
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:21,640
And this goes back to this, even the Sumerians told that Anki, Anki's the one, Anki's the one who

901
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:29,480
tells Arthahassis that Anu is going to wipe all you out. You better build an ark. This is the

902
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:37,000
story you get with Dukallion. Instead of Anki, it's Prometheus. Prometheus is the savior. He

903
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:41,400
tells the humans how to survive because Zeus is a tyrant who's going to kill you all. It

904
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:45,480
doesn't like you, but Zeus doesn't want any humans to live. He's going to kill everybody.

905
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:50,360
Build a boat, take your wife with you and you can, and I'll tell you how to survive.

906
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:56,200
I'll tell you how to eat from the tree of knowledge and become like a god. That's the side. That's

907
01:45:56,200 --> 01:46:04,920
the good side. That was the father of the civil. Yeah, who did that. And Pulascus was her brother.

908
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:12,360
Ew, we're going back prehistory. It's in the genealogy. No, but this is what's so brilliant

909
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:19,240
about the Greeks is that in these myths, they're writing, they're giving us like,

910
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:23,720
not only scientific treatises about like Big Bang and like, I'm not saying Big Bang,

911
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:29,400
but like there's like these little scientific treatises injected in the text, but they're also

912
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:37,160
telling history that the, the Pulascians, the, the, um, in the genealogy of these gods is this

913
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:44,680
genealogy of historical tribes that existed in the Mediterranean world and they're, and they're

914
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:50,040
preserving it in the myths. Brilliant. It's brilliant stuff. It really is. You got to,

915
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:56,760
you got to hand it to the Greeks. Brilliant. They really were just amazing at preserving history

916
01:46:57,480 --> 01:47:01,560
in the myths. Now historians and scholars can look at these myths and say,

917
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:05,960
oh shoot, they're telling the story about the Pulascians coming out of the Black Sea region after

918
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:10,440
a flood and, and populating the world. That's what they're doing. They're telling that story.

919
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:18,040
That's why whenever I read ancient texts, I focus on the material evidence. Just show me the dildos,

920
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:27,400
show me the drugs, show me the purple anuses, you know what I mean? Show me the, yeah, no, show me

921
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:35,800
the, it's all in the text, you know, kids cutting their testicles off and throwing them into the

922
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:40,680
home where they have to get all the clothing from because they're going to be dressed like

923
01:47:41,320 --> 01:47:47,000
girls from now on. That's in the right. That's the mystery religion of the Phrygians.

924
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:54,040
To look at their identity, I guarantee you. On March 25th, every year, they would initiate

925
01:47:54,040 --> 01:48:00,840
new eunuch priests to take care of the temple of Kaiboli and they had, they had to mimic what Addis

926
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:06,440
did and castrate themselves and then throw their testicles into the house. That's whoever,

927
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:10,920
whoever caught that testicle had to go, they, there was their duty to bring the clothing out,

928
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:18,200
right? Tell them. Let's run this by. I'm a eunuch priest. I just castrate myself. I throw my

929
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:24,920
testicles into your house. Now, what does that mean to you? It means I got to make sure that you

930
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:32,200
look nice. I've got to provide you with some good clothing. It is, it's my religious duty

931
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:37,640
to do it. I don't care if you've got any daughters or not, right? This is a something,

932
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:46,840
it's a religious duty. It's a sacred thing. And by the way, Lucian says some people who came just

933
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:53,480
to watch this because, you know, like you said, it's a, you know, it's a holy event. It's a festival,

934
01:48:53,480 --> 01:49:03,560
right? Some people who come to watch get caught up in the process and end up out there naked in

935
01:49:03,560 --> 01:49:13,960
front of the population cutting their testicles off. Wow. And this is, this is because they really

936
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:20,040
believe in these rights. Yeah. They're practicing the sacred ancient, and these Phrygian rights

937
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:25,560
weren't new. They were going, and they said that the Phrygians got their rights from Samoth race.

938
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:31,080
Yeah. Yeah. Yassion, this is the story that, and even Clement talks about this in his

939
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:39,320
explanation of the Greeks. Yassion laid with Demeter in a fall night, right before fall came,

940
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:43,640
and then Zeus struck him down with lightning bolt. But they say before that happened, he brought the

941
01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:54,680
rights to Phrygia. Yassion, right? Jason or Jesus, same name. And there's actually some text that

942
01:49:54,760 --> 01:50:01,960
spell Yassios with an S at the end. It's a title. It's a title, right? It's a title within the

943
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:07,640
cult. It's a healer. Right. Yeah. And it comes from, you're exactly right to point out that

944
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:14,120
yaho root. People think that it's used in magic, by the way, just those Greek letters,

945
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:25,720
iota, alpha, omega, is part of a magic ritual. It is the saying of the I am that I am, right?

946
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:31,880
And it's a healing. They, Paion, they, is one of the shots that they have with it in the rights.

947
01:50:32,440 --> 01:50:37,000
So you can see these things. I mean, they're in the text. I'm telling you, you take those gospels

948
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:42,360
and cut out all the sections that have to do with Jesus performing mystery

949
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:51,400
as a magus and getting down on a young kid who's acting as the bridge, by the way, Neil,

950
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:57,400
the bridge, by the way, with the kid or the drugs, right? That kid is there administering

951
01:50:57,960 --> 01:51:06,600
that drug to Jesus. That kid is the Ganymede, the cup, right? That kid is the cup. And Jesus

952
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:13,160
is taking that cup and it poisons his ass. And he ends up not getting the antidote and screaming

953
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:19,560
on the cross and dying early. Neil, we know for a fact, all the evangelicals out there, please

954
01:51:20,920 --> 01:51:28,360
support this. We know for a fact, Jesus did not die of crucifixion. He did not die of crucifixion.

955
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:34,920
Ask the next religious historian, say this crazy guy said, Jesus didn't die of crucifixion.

956
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:40,200
That's what the texts say, right? Because the Romans were like, fuck, they even noted it.

957
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:45,560
They're like, oh, he was dead early. He's hanging up there. You know, he shouldn't be dead yet.

958
01:51:45,560 --> 01:51:50,680
Quick, right, right. Right? What's going on? Right? You know what's interesting about that.

959
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:54,680
I'm going to go ahead and finish that thought. Well, he's screaming. I just want you to realize

960
01:51:54,680 --> 01:52:00,280
he's there screaming, right? And he's yelling out his stuff about being thirsty. He's yelling

961
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:07,720
out a phrase which strangely enough looks like it's been lifted the sabbathon directly from

962
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:16,360
the magical papyri that you're contemporary that Paul is saying, throw your magic books out, right?

963
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:24,040
Guess what? Jesus is using one. Yeah, right. Look, look, look, you just nailed on what I was

964
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:30,360
about to say. So that sabbathon thing, right? Everyone's pointed out that it's in Psalm 22.

965
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:37,480
Okay. They chose that Psalm for a reason because it's pointing to the sabbathon.

966
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:45,080
My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? But the Greek, if you look at the Septuagint version,

967
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:50,120
there's something happening there with the sabbathon. But listen to this, though.

968
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:55,880
Put that aside for a second. You got the sabbathon on the cross. He's yelling out,

969
01:52:55,880 --> 01:53:01,000
my God, why are you forsaking me? Psalm 22. But the other three Gospels, he's also,

970
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:08,360
all three of them have a different Psalm. So when one of them, it's this, my God, the other one,

971
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:16,440
it's LOI. Like all three, all four of the Gospels are from a different Psalm. Psalms are songs that

972
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:23,480
you sing. They're hymns. Orpheus, when Orpheus is killed by the Maynids, what is he doing?

973
01:53:24,360 --> 01:53:35,960
He's singing hymns. Both Jesus and Orpheus die singing chants in hymns. It's Orpic. I'm telling

974
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:42,280
you it's Orpic. That's what it is. It's Orpic. Why is that? Is it just me or was Orpheus in his,

975
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:51,960
before he was torn apart by the crowd of his own followers? He was saying something about naked

976
01:53:51,960 --> 01:54:00,760
boys, wasn't he? He didn't sweat at all. So this is Orpheus' metamorphosis. Actually, I think I had

977
01:54:00,760 --> 01:54:06,120
a text right here somewhere. We can just catch people up. We can just catch people up. All right,

978
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:15,640
look at this up. Orpheus' metamorphosis, the last story about Orpheus, after the Eurydus story,

979
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:24,040
it says that Orpheus was so depressed about Eurydus that he decided to take up the thration rights

980
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:32,120
of plucking little boys' manhoods before they come of age, and that women were throwing themselves

981
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:37,800
at Orpheus and he was denying them because he was into this stuff now. I'm not just making this up.

982
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:44,200
This isn't the text. He's plucking his nectar, people. He's plucking his nectar and he's bringing

983
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:52,440
that kid. Galen has the descriptions of the pre-puberty boy, excreta, and the post-puberty.

984
01:54:52,440 --> 01:55:00,440
He's getting that serious fluid. Why? Because we're cutting him and we're wrapping him with

985
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:07,480
wraps so that he can have venom concoctions administered directly. I mean, this is a great

986
01:55:07,480 --> 01:55:15,080
way to fly, brah. Yeah, eunuchs. You thought all the eunuchs were made by carving. There's also

987
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:22,840
chemical ways, right? There's chemical ways for that transformation to find that feminine, to take

988
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:30,440
that masculine, and to bring out snappy. There's ways to do that, and they're involved in these

989
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:38,760
ways. This should make you, evangelicals, very scared at the same time, very upset that your own

990
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:47,640
dude was involved in this kind of activity. You're holding up signs that say, hey, save the children.

991
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:58,120
Guess what? Your guy at Putin is abducting them, and your guy, Jesus, was thick in it. Thick in it.

992
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:07,720
Yeah, welcome. Welcome to your Christian mystery. Yeah. I was pulling up the text before they say

993
01:56:07,720 --> 01:56:12,920
that I'm a liar, that I'm crazy. You have to see it for yourself. It's book 11, I believe,

994
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:18,040
by the depth of Orpheus. So while the songs, let me see. Let me see if I can share my screen.

995
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:25,080
Let me see. Damn. Yeah, I'll share my screen right now.

996
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:31,560
Just read it to us, Neil. Just read it. I'm trying to find it, actually. It's somewhere in,

997
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:38,440
it's somewhere right before he dies. I know that. Let's see. Bacchus and Midas. Bacchus.

998
01:56:39,400 --> 01:56:44,360
Here we go. I'll talk while you're looking. Oh, did you find it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look for it.

999
01:56:44,360 --> 01:56:51,160
All right. Talk while I'm looking for it. So he's looking for this myth. It's basically the myth

1000
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:59,080
that Orpheus was killed by his own menads, right? And that he was killed for that reason because he

1001
01:56:59,080 --> 01:57:09,640
swore off. He swore off the right. He stopped the mystery and declared that he would only worship

1002
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:20,120
the sun. Yeah, Apollo, right? Yeah. So they cut his head off and threw it in the river and

1003
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:26,760
he, you know, people will take credit for where that ended up and whatnot. I'll get it ready for

1004
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:30,680
the next time we do all live because I don't, I gotta go to the bathroom anyway. We've been going

1005
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:37,480
live for two hours and I'm sure you got stuff to do anyway. But yeah, listen. Look it up.

1006
01:57:37,480 --> 01:57:44,680
Orpheus is metamorphosis. The last thing he does before he gets killed is he takes on the

1007
01:57:44,680 --> 01:57:50,120
Thracian rites. This is what it says. This is not my words. This is Orpheus words. Takes on the

1008
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:57,160
Thracian rites of plucking little boys' manhoods before they come of age. And he says that they're

1009
01:57:57,160 --> 01:58:01,240
women were throwing themselves at him and he was denying them. That's what it says.

1010
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:08,840
Just saying what it says. But that's Orpheus. We just went full back circle at the beginning of

1011
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:15,480
this text. What's happening in Mark 14? Something Orpheus happening. That's what it is. Something

1012
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:20,600
mysterious. Something. Oh, sorry. You, I missed your super chat. Have you made a video on the

1013
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:25,160
exiting Soul Trap? Have you spoken with Howdy Missak? I will look into that. That's a good

1014
01:58:25,160 --> 01:58:31,320
question. Thank you for the super chat. But yeah, back to full circle again. What is happening

1015
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:39,000
in Mark 14? It's the mystery. That's what's happening. Last final thoughts on this.

1016
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:50,520
My final thoughts, if I can have any, are that we need to just accept the evidence.

1017
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:57,720
We don't need any ideas. We don't need any theories. We just need to look at the texts that are there

1018
01:58:57,720 --> 01:59:03,560
and to determine, okay, what are they using? How are they using it? It's just good detective work.

1019
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:11,240
And in doing so, we can free people from the narrative that they've already been fed.

1020
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:18,200
And that is causing this great, I mean, this is our duty, man. If Tom Jefferson were here,

1021
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:26,600
he was a classicist. He'd be like, you people, you know, oh, Neil, Neil, when are they going to

1022
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:33,880
listen? When are they going to listen? It's, oh, you know, um, yeah, that's all I can say. Hey,

1023
01:59:33,880 --> 01:59:38,840
have you heard from Anastasia at all? Do you have any updates? Everybody's

1024
01:59:38,840 --> 01:59:46,040
She's, uh, she was talking about how one of her friends who was a, who was a male stripper.

1025
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:52,840
And I, it reminds me of what you said about Hercules. Hercules putting on the, you know,

1026
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:59,320
putting on the costume of the garb of the women and, uh, then going to war because this male

1027
01:59:59,320 --> 02:00:05,000
stripper is dressed up ready to fight the Russians. She was posing pictures with them. I was like,

1028
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:10,680
that's all the Ukrainians. I love the Ukrainians so much. They're the heroes of today. They're,

1029
02:00:10,680 --> 02:00:14,760
that's those are the Bacchic warriors right now. That's Hercules and Bacchus over there.

1030
02:00:15,480 --> 02:00:21,720
What is it, Neil? Do you think it's the tension? Like at a specific place and time, you know,

1031
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:27,480
that you'll have this force attracted and you can really concentrate. I mean, the place where they

1032
02:00:27,480 --> 02:00:37,720
hung the fleece was sacred to Mars. So it's a, it's a war environment. Is it that war environment

1033
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:46,200
that suddenly brings that virgin, you know, that somebody can be the receptacle then? I mean,

1034
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:52,760
I don't mean to be creepy or culty or anything, but if you think about it, the people then who are

1035
02:00:52,760 --> 02:01:01,400
in that environment like Anastasia, it, she be, can become the receptacle for real freedom for

1036
02:01:01,400 --> 02:01:08,920
that actual spirit of Athena. Am I crazy or? No, that's what it is. That's that. I think of the

1037
02:01:09,560 --> 02:01:16,120
democracy versus whatever Russia, I mean, I guess it's like an oligarchy, right?

1038
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:23,080
That's that Republican oligarchy, you know, where the, the billionaires are deciding the

1039
02:01:23,080 --> 02:01:30,360
fate of the people. Whereas the Ukraine has that like that, that symbol of lady liberty

1040
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:37,400
holding up the, the, the, the scale in her hands and the sword in the other hand. And that's Ukraine

1041
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:44,040
right now. That's Ukraine right now. Ukraine is embodying that spirit right now. That's the lady

1042
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:51,240
with the scale and one hand and the sword on the other hand. Ukraine, that's who you are right now.

1043
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:59,800
That's how I see it. She's the virgin male. I mean, if we're going to find Athena somewhere,

1044
02:02:00,520 --> 02:02:07,640
there ever be somewhere, you know what I mean? Oh, I can't, I can't wait. This is fantastic.

1045
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:13,800
You know, it's, it's terrible to, it's terrible to see something beautiful and something that's so

1046
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:21,160
dark. But I mean, that's what dawn is, right? That's what that's what the dawn bringers do.

1047
02:02:22,120 --> 02:02:27,640
Right. This is, I wish we could speak about all the cult. We didn't even get to the,

1048
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:35,480
the, the, the panto clator and the connection to Mithras. Did you know here, I'll leave with,

1049
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:40,600
I'll leave with this. Go ahead. Take your time. Take your time. I'll just tease. There's a direct

1050
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:50,600
linguistic connection between Jesus Christ and Mithras. He is the unconquered son. Yeah, it's

1051
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:55,080
gorgeous. Yeah, I'll show you the, it's the Bible, man. Nobody ever reads it. I don't know why.

1052
02:02:55,960 --> 02:03:03,960
Yeah. Oh, I also have the link for your YouTube in the description. I'm showing it right now.

1053
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:09,880
Subscribe to Lady Babylon and what, what twice a week you're going live and you're doing deep

1054
02:03:09,880 --> 02:03:15,880
dives like you just heard today. So the, if you like what you heard today, Amon does this twice

1055
02:03:15,880 --> 02:03:21,160
a week. He's doing this and he's touching on different subjects in the ancient Greek world

1056
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:26,280
that nobody's talking about. You'll not get this anywhere else, except for Lady. I'm, I'm not

1057
02:03:26,280 --> 02:03:32,520
kidding. I watch every time you're live. I'm watching every time. So I thank you for the

1058
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:39,880
opportunity, Neil, to be able to speak. And you know, I want people to know Neil told me last

1059
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:47,720
week, he was like, you realize we're at war. And I was like, Oh, this guy's crazy. What's he doing?

1060
02:03:48,680 --> 02:03:55,640
You know, I was like, what? And I got to thinking about it over a couple of days, right? And

1061
02:03:56,760 --> 02:04:06,840
he understood. He had a focus and he understood exactly what one of those watchers, one of those

1062
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:13,240
watchers would give you in Sodom, the exact same thing. Those are the lightning bringers,

1063
02:04:13,240 --> 02:04:19,240
right? Those bring the fire from all on us. This is heavenly kingdom stuff, people. You don't

1064
02:04:19,240 --> 02:04:25,800
realize what's there. It's the apocalypse. Neil, you promised me we bring the apocalypse or we

1065
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:33,960
don't do it. We are, we this is, this is exactly what that is. Neil and I are two witnesses for you.

1066
02:04:34,840 --> 02:04:46,840
Yeah. And we are witnessing to Jesus Christ, the selling pirate child rapist. Jesus Christ,

1067
02:04:46,840 --> 02:04:54,520
the kid selling child rapist. Druggy, he's on drugs, a lot of drugs, Jesus and drugs.

1068
02:04:54,840 --> 02:05:08,520
Yeah. That's what it is. Oh, shoot, I found it. Orpheus. Such was the grave,

1069
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:13,240
grove of Orpheus drawn together. He surrounded the seven of my animals. He tried the cords and

1070
02:05:13,240 --> 02:05:19,880
was convinced on the notes, raised the voice, oh muse, was this it? But now, but now for the

1071
02:05:19,880 --> 02:05:25,640
gentler, I would sing for boys, the favorites of the gods, and even of maids, pay the penalties

1072
02:05:25,640 --> 02:05:31,160
for the wrong. Is that it? No, that's something else. Huh. All right, I'll find it next time.

1073
02:05:32,360 --> 02:05:36,600
It's somewhere in Orpheus, or something, somewhere in Ovid. I'll find it for next time.

1074
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:39,800
And by the way, Neil, no, by the way, you know, it's really cool of it.

1075
02:05:39,800 --> 02:05:42,520
Oh, I found it. I found my Ovid. Okay. Okay, I can hide it now.

1076
02:05:42,520 --> 02:05:44,440
It's very cool. I'll, I'll.

1077
02:05:44,440 --> 02:05:48,280
So glad we held out this long. I found it right now. I have it saved right here.

1078
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:54,200
Okay. It's so glad. It's so good that you're doing this with Ovid, that you're resurrecting Ovid.

1079
02:05:55,000 --> 02:06:02,200
Doesn't he get imprisoned in the most hostile place, the civilization at the time?

1080
02:06:03,400 --> 02:06:07,320
And it was for Julia, wasn't it? It was maybe for...

1081
02:06:07,880 --> 02:06:12,520
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ovid. Yeah. Okay. Can you, can you read this for me?

1082
02:06:13,400 --> 02:06:13,900
Yeah.

1083
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:20,520
Picks. Oh, the top part, the top part. This is from...

1084
02:06:21,080 --> 02:06:27,000
Yeah, with the love of women, with the love of women, perhaps because of his fortune and love,

1085
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:34,840
or he may have plighted his troth forever, but scores of women were burning to sleep with the

1086
02:06:34,840 --> 02:06:41,000
bard and suffered the pain of rejection. Oh, yeah, that's right. You, yeah.

1087
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:44,760
Women are throwing themselves at him and he's rejecting them. That's what that means.

1088
02:06:44,760 --> 02:06:50,280
Yeah. You, Elvis, Elvis is not available right before Orpheus gets killed, but keep going.

1089
02:06:50,280 --> 02:06:56,840
Orpheus even started the practice among the Thracian tribes of turning for love to immature males

1090
02:06:57,400 --> 02:07:04,680
in a plucking the flower of a boy's brief spring before he has come to his manhood.

1091
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:10,120
Welcome to salvation, brothers and sisters. Welcome to salvation.

1092
02:07:10,120 --> 02:07:11,880
Welcome to the mysteries. Yeah.

1093
02:07:13,640 --> 02:07:18,200
So the answer, the answer to the question that we've been, the answer to the question of this,

1094
02:07:18,200 --> 02:07:22,600
of this stream, what is happening in Mark 14? Yeah. Yeah.

1095
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:30,280
Mysteries. Yeah. Brilliant. Neil, that was the best thing ever produced. Yeah, I can't,

it's done. It's done. Thank you. You have just attained true gnosis.

1097
02:07:44,200 --> 02:07:46,280
You have just attained true gnosis.

1098
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:55,400
The demiurge has no power over you.
