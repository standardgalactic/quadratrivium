00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
Welcome back to the Gnostic Informant and you are about to attain true gnosis and today

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,040
we're going to go deep again.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,840
As you know, I have Dr. Amon with me.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,800
And if you haven't yet subscribed, go to Lady Babylon, hit that subscribe button.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:28,040
This is, this is one, there's only one place in the world where you're going to find content

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,040
like this.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,840
And I'm not joking.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:39,680
This is a perfect, this is a real classical philologist who is trained in the ancient

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,840
classical Greek languages, who also studies the, the, the drugs.

10
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,840
What do I mean by that?

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,280
Well, I'll just pull, I'll just give you an example.

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,160
He wrote, kind of a commuse.

13
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,600
This is a big hit.

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,240
As you can see, you know, the times UK said, this is the last wild frontier of classical

15
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,240
studies.

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,000
And you can get it right here on Amazon, links in the description.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,120
The ancient world is not what you think.

18
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,200
I mean, just imagine if we had the like, I don't know, Lord of the Rings, but it was

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,600
rated R and there's prostitutes and drugs everywhere.

20
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:25,640
That's the ancient world that we don't, that we lost through a thousand years of the church.

21
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,520
But the ancient world before the church was a different place and we lose a lot of the

22
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,960
context of that.

23
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,120
When this, and that's what Dr. Amon brings to the table.

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,520
He reminds, he's reminding the world of what the ancients were doing.

25
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,760
And he brings a lot of context that is needed in my opinion when I'm looking into stuff

26
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,760
that I do.

27
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,120
Also, he offers his services.

28
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,520
And as you can see, he's a PhD in classics, he's got five stars, perfect rating out of

29
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,360
378 ratings.

30
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,400
You can hit the link in the description if you want to learn classical Greek or Latin.

31
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,600
He does both.

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,960
Let's just go down real quick just to see some of these reviews.

33
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,800
Learning is easy to Professor David.

34
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,960
He makes it fun and interesting.

35
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,800
Learning is quick and very smooth.

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,080
That was me, by the way.

37
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,840
Four lessons I've done so far.

38
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,840
Knowledgeable is an understatement.

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,320
Amon is able to take me through ancient Greek in a way that other teacher could.

40
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,840
I am comfortable learning with Amon and look forward to continuing.

41
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:35,480
There is countless, countless people who have left five stars and who are continuing to

42
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,320
get learning languages from Dr. Amon.

43
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:44,360
So with that being said, make sure you hit those subscribes, check out those links.

44
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,920
And we are going to have an amazing, amazing show tonight.

45
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,120
We're going to go deep into the stuff that they do not tell you in church.

46
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,160
Let me repeat that.

47
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,800
You will not hear this in church.

48
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,400
Hit the intro.

49
00:03:44,360 --> 00:04:11,200
All right, here's without further ado, Dr. Amon, what is going on?

50
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,560
Neil, the great informant of the gnosis.

51
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,160
Yes, it's good to see you and thank you for having me on.

52
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,240
It's always, I'm always jumping at the chance to come on and address your audience.

53
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,320
So thank you for having me.

54
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
Absolutely.

55
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,160
I can't wait to get into this topic because as you guys know in the thumbnail, gangster

56
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,680
Jesus, some of you might be like, come on, that's a cheap shot.

57
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,000
But wait, this is, there's something to this thing.

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,040
He is a boaster.

59
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,040
He is not playing around.

60
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,520
The Jesus you get in church is, you know, love your neighbor as you love yourself.

61
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,360
And the greatest thing you can do is love.

62
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:59,920
But that's, that's part of his schizophrenic, if you will, message that flips on a dime and

63
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:06,040
he'll just randomly snap and then brag about going after Jezebel and throwing her on a

64
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:12,400
table to rape her and then killing your children and then saying, I am the morning star, bitch.

65
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,520
And like, we're going to get into these texts right now.

66
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,240
You're probably running, what, what are you talking about?

67
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,880
What text is this?

68
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,760
And that's what we're about to bring you right now.

69
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,360
So let's get into it.

70
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,880
This is the Bible thug life, man.

71
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,280
This is the thug life of the Bible.

72
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,920
When I started dipping into the drugs and antiquity and the prostitution and these cult rights

73
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,920
and stuff.

74
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,280
Yeah, you see a lot of thuggery.

75
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
Yeah.

76
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,960
So this is a great topic.

77
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,760
Let's bring it all out.

78
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,760
All out.

79
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,760
Good.

80
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,760
Absolutely.

81
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,760
Good.

82
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,320
I want to, can I throw up first and I more want to present this to you and then you have,

83
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,280
you give me meal, your thing, because people like this love between us.

84
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,280
Yeah.

85
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,280
I'm going to pump up your energy.

86
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,720
We're going to bounce you back and forth.

87
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
All right.

88
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
Let's go.

89
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,840
That first email, the Peter kills Ananias, right?

90
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,840
Yeah.

91
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,840
Right.

92
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:16,280
So there was a certain guy named Ananias and his wife was Sapphira, right?

93
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,320
Anyway, he sold some land, some of his own goods he sold, right?

94
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,400
This is usually like a building upon a piece of land or something.

95
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:31,600
He's got some cash there going and he, like everybody else, he sells it, right?

96
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,640
And he only gave a part.

97
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,560
He only gave a part of it to Peter, right?

98
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,800
And so Peter says, Hey, what are you filled with Satan, you know, that you got this thing

99
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,640
in your heart, that you're lying to the spirit of God, that you, you kept some of this stuff

100
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,520
back, bro.

101
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,760
And yeah.

102
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,200
And that's where it gets weird because he falls down right away.

103
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,400
He falls down and dies.

104
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Wow.

105
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,440
Yeah.

106
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,560
You're in this X Epsuchsen, X Epsuchsen.

107
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:15,240
And it uses a weird word there, uses a very weird word there, neo for to die.

108
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:22,720
It's used by the doctors on the side of the medical tax for losing a heart rate, a stable

109
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,840
heart rate, because they were all, they were all into the pulse and whatnot.

110
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,440
And so it has to do with some kind of cardiac event, right?

111
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,600
And so there he is.

112
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
That makes sense.

113
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,640
Why he hits the ground, right?

114
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,800
As dead.

115
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,600
And the text says that this, this message went out, man.

116
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
People stood in fear.

117
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,400
People were afraid because of this.

118
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
Yeah.

119
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,800
And then he brings in his wife.

120
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,920
Same thing happens to his wife.

121
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,000
She hits the ground.

122
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And he tells her.

123
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,080
It's so good.

124
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,080
He can tell her.

125
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,400
He says, we just took your husband out and buried him just like we're going to bury

126
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
you.

127
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,960
And boom, she hits the ground.

128
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,800
Now what's funny that people don't point out is there are some neoniscoy, right?

129
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,600
There's some neoteroi there.

130
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,840
These are the new initiates.

131
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,040
These are the people who've just started into the cult, right?

132
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,880
Who were just in the family, calling people brother and they sit there and they do what

133
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,040
Peter tells them to do.

134
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:33,680
So somehow Peter had this interaction and in both cases, in both cases, he was able to

135
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,880
get them to die on cue, right?

136
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:47,920
When you sin against that pluma, that is a sin that is performed within the right.

137
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,440
That's the only thing that can't be pardoned is a sin within the right.

138
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,560
And if you took that poison without taking the antidote, you were dead.

139
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,280
And if Peter didn't give it to you, that's it.

140
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,280
Yeah.

141
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:11,600
And I want to throw something out here too because this is coming from the chapter where

142
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:19,800
these new initiates, they sold their property and they gave away most of the funds to the

143
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,400
church or the assembly and kept a little bit for themselves.

144
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,480
And that was enough.

145
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,980
That was not cool.

146
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,760
They were not playing around.

147
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,200
You're supposed to give all of it, you're not supposed to keep any of it for yourself.

148
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,200
That is it.

149
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:41,440
Where's all these conservative Republican Christians at today that are owning businesses

150
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,080
and you think they would ever, that's not the way, like what happened to that?

151
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,680
The idea that you can't have any private property.

152
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680
That's gone now.

153
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,880
That's not the Christians today.

154
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,960
This is a whole different world back then.

155
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
Yeah.

156
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:03,040
According to our modern evangelical fairytale, it's our blessing by God who has given us

157
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,240
manifest destiny to be able to make as much capital as we possibly can.

158
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,880
But in antiquity, those Christians were instructed, you have to get rid of everything.

159
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,040
And what they said was you got to lay it at the feet of the rock.

160
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,080
You got to lay everything at the feet of the rock.

161
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,080
And so that's what they did.

162
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:30,240
And then it says they redistributed out what they needed for food and whatnot like that.

163
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,240
So yeah.

164
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
Right.

165
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,240
Remember, these people are dropping out though.

166
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,440
They're dropping out of society, right?

167
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
They're disappearing.

168
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,200
They're leaving families.

169
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
They're doing all this.

170
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,720
So we got kind of a radical group.

171
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:50,960
And when we see gangster Peter, right, making these hits and setting the stage for the

172
00:10:50,960 --> 00:11:00,080
rock, Petros, yeah, that's his gang name, you know, he's got some friends.

173
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,520
They call them the sons of thunder.

174
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,000
Don't mess with these people.

175
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,240
We know that they're armed.

176
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:15,000
Where Peter's the one who jumps out and starts swinging the sword, right, cuts his ear off.

177
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yeah.

178
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,240
He's not supposed to be carrying a sword, by the way.

179
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
That's a no-no.

180
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,240
Right.

181
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,000
And there's no, you know, Ray in antiquity, they have laws against things, right?

182
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,480
So yeah, he's armed and he's there.

183
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,440
And he's there with the trafficking Jesus, with the boy and the naked boy.

184
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,600
But let's go to the, let's go to the next one.

185
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Yeah.

186
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,280
All curses, right?

187
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,960
There won't be any curses anymore.

188
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,760
This is from Apocalypse.

189
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,760
Yeah.

190
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,600
And the throne of God, the lamb was in them, right, will be in them.

191
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,720
And the slaves, right, they'll serve them, right?

192
00:11:52,720 --> 00:12:00,880
And they will look upon his face and they're, they're, they're foreheads, metopon, right

193
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,040
on their foreheads.

194
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:07,480
They're going to have to on them out to, they're going to have his name.

195
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:20,920
This thug leader has slaves and those slaves bear a brand as do any slaves, right?

196
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,120
This is, you know, we're not living in a slave culture, so this doesn't strike us.

197
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,040
But these are, that word Latreo is that word of service.

198
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:36,360
Jesus has slaves whom he imprints with his own name on their heads, right?

199
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,240
Now remember, we looked at Jesus as the laystace.

200
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,000
He calls himself, when he gets arrested, he comes out yelling, he's like, would you come

201
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,040
out against me armed like I'm a pirate, right?

202
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,520
This is the accoutrement of the pirate, right?

203
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,680
This is, he's got a brand that he carries, right?

204
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,800
And he brands you, you're his, right, and he's going to trade you off.

205
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,160
That brand will follow you.

206
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,560
You'll always be in service, bro.

207
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,240
So this is a part of the machinery of antiquity.

208
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,320
People don't realize it's baked into the language, you know what I mean?

209
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,720
Oh, that's crazy.

210
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,200
That is wild, actually.

211
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:25,160
That is just absolutely, I mean, he's, this is like, you're, you're getting branded.

212
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,680
You're getting, basically getting tatted basically for your gang.

213
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,000
And now you better die, you better be a martyr for this gang.

214
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's, it's radical.

215
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,280
This is not like some club that everybody was holding hands and doing hymns like your,

216
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,720
like your Sunday church.

217
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,760
This is like, you're going to get a brand on you and then you better go and die for

218
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,760
this faith.

219
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Because if you don't, you're not real.

220
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,760
Yeah.

221
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,520
You better be a, this is like the real, I don't know, I was going to say the word jihadi,

222
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:59,040
but like, kind of, did you notice, did you notice the apocalypse?

223
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,800
He's constantly threatening, I'll, I'll wipe your name out of the book of life.

224
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,440
If you do this, I'll wipe your name out of the book of life.

225
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,440
They're not playing around.

226
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,760
This is not a light at all.

227
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,760
This is serious.

228
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,760
Yeah.

229
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,760
Yeah.

230
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,120
And why is he coming back?

231
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,600
People are like, Jesus, come back and resurrect me and the evangelicals are like, Oh, I'm a

232
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,840
dominionist, pre tribulations, right?

233
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,920
Just BS that has no, that has no meaning to it.

234
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,360
From the 1600s that they just made up, it's not, it's not biblical.

235
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,000
Like, like, like Bart Ehrman pointed out in one of Derek's videos that Jesus is coming

236
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
back.

237
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,320
He's going to look for people when he says Jezebel, he's talking about people, a specific

238
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,680
type of people who are profaners of the mysteries, people who are part, he's going to take them,

239
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:56,160
throw her out of bed, rape her, go look for her children and kill them.

240
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
Well, that's, that's, that's the return of Jesus.

241
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
There's no rapture.

242
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,880
There's no come to take my people who believe me.

243
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,120
No, it's come to kill the people who don't believe me.

244
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,080
It's the, it's the negative.

245
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,080
It's the opposite of that.

246
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,200
That's a thug hit right there, baby.

247
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Kill that.

248
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,480
Not only that, kill that, kill that BI.

249
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,480
You know what?

250
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,680
And her children to knock them all off, knock them all off.

251
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,680
It's a hit.

252
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,720
But that's, that's, that's, that's your, that's your basic messiah, messianic, all messiahs

253
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,280
doesn't matter what sect or religion, that's the, the idea of the messiah.

254
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,200
That's what the messiah is supposed to do.

255
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Yeah.

256
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,280
That's not, that's not nothing new that Christianity is bringing to the table.

257
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,480
That's just, that's the messiah.

258
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,840
That's the real messiah.

259
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,640
There is nothing new that Christianity brought to the table.

260
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,640
Yeah.

261
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,040
There is nothing new, right?

262
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,600
If you took a pin and marked out like you were redacting something for a lawyer or something.

263
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,000
If you went, took a pin, black pin and marked out everything that had precedent, the whole

264
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,120
thing would be dark, you know, except for Jesus went down to Bethany.

265
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,360
That's the only thing that, you know, just be his directions.

266
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
Right.

267
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,360
Right.

268
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,360
Yeah.

269
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,360
Love it.

270
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,360
Love it.

271
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,600
It's everything is, but you can't, you and I can't do anything original, right?

272
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,400
You don't, you see anybody else coming up with a religion that's new thing like that?

273
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,400
No.

274
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,280
You see with language, when you talk, when you're using a certain language, you cannot

275
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:28,800
come out of, you can't separate yourself from the linguistics that you're operating within.

276
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,720
No, it's like an amber and it traps you.

277
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,760
That language traps the meaning for, forever preserves it.

278
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,760
Yeah.

279
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,760
He's going to come back.

280
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,760
He's not, people think he's coming back and it's all going to be half resurrection and

281
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,760
I'm going to heaven.

282
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,760
You all can.

283
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
No, no, no.

284
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,480
He's going to come back to kill all of us.

285
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,520
The mission is to kill everyone.

286
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,160
Think about this.

287
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,520
Think about, let's look at some more sources.

288
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,680
What's that next one?

289
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,680
Yeah.

290
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,680
Don't do that.

291
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,960
Oh, I just wanted to bring this up because this is a quote, you know, revelation 22.

292
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,000
I am a fellow servant with you.

293
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Right.

294
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,480
That word servant is the same word for slave, right?

295
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,480
Right.

296
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,480
Yeah.

297
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,480
No, no, no.

298
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,280
He's talking about bowing.

299
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,760
This is an angel responding to John who's bowing in front of him.

300
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,920
He says, don't do that.

301
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:27,280
He's like, you know, I'm a, I'm a, I'm also a slave, right?

302
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,200
And then he says worship God.

303
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,200
The only one that you're that slave to is the living God.

304
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,120
We are do Lloyd.

305
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,320
We are slaves, brah.

306
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,320
Yeah.

307
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,320
Okay.

308
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,320
Next one that.

309
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,320
Oh, look at this one.

310
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,320
Oh.

311
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:52,000
And by the way, isn't that, isn't there, isn't, isn't he basically calling him like the equivalent

312
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
of the B word, right?

313
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,320
Uh, he's, well, uh, that's an interesting question.

314
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,560
That's an interesting question.

315
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:10,880
I don't, uh, it's so cult tied up this word, that you even have dogs who are official priests.

316
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,000
So the, because the next one is father McCoy, right?

317
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,360
Those are people who are specific.

318
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,760
That's a technical term.

319
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,760
Yeah.

320
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:27,680
Those are people within the cult or within the community who are experts in drugs, right?

321
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,160
And, and so all of these are the pornoi.

322
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,520
Who do you think the pornoi are?

323
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,160
Those are the people that's the lady Babylon way, right?

324
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,840
And, and why do you think they're called phonase?

325
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,280
They're called murderers because they're performing their sacrifice.

326
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:53,200
And the last one, the a dola la trii, those who were in service of the image, the image

327
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,520
of the image, right?

328
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,920
These, these people are the people on the outside that, and what's going to happen to

329
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,920
them, right?

330
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,960
Let's see what the next one is.

331
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,960
Yeah.

332
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
Yeah.

333
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Yeah.

334
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,240
And she'll take away the words of the book of the prophets.

335
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:15,560
God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from

336
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,080
the things which are written in this book.

337
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,080
Yeah.

338
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,200
This is intense, man.

339
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,320
This is not the love your neighbor type of Jesus right here.

340
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,360
This is, he's going to wipe you off the face of the planet like you never existed, throw

341
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,640
you in the lake of fire.

342
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,800
That's what this is.

343
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,680
And when you say wipe off, you're right.

344
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,480
That's exactly off the LA is exactly that, right?

345
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,880
He's going to take out your portion, right from the tree of life.

346
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,880
You're not going to have any sort of access to this, right?

347
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,880
That's it, bro.

348
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,560
I'm going to kill you dead.

349
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,000
Is this a threat, Neil?

350
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,560
When you said gangster Jesus, and I was like, this is perfect.

351
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:00,560
This was Neil's idea by the way, I said, this is perfect gangster all over the place.

352
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,560
This is an example.

353
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:07,200
He's got a book and if you're not in it, right, you don't get anywhere.

354
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,800
You don't get anywhere without me in my book.

355
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,120
That's a gangster, bro.

356
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,120
Yeah.

357
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,120
It's gorgeous.

358
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,120
Yeah.

359
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,120
Yeah.

360
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,920
And it's like, there's no, this isn't about like doing anything or feeding the poor or

361
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,920
doing.

362
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,920
It's just about getting in line and do what I say.

363
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:30,640
That's the only thing that makes you or breaks you in the eyes of this God.

364
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,600
Do get in line, period.

365
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,440
I don't care what's, there's no objective morality.

366
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,680
Like you hear these Christians talk about today and no, no, no, no, no, no, it's get

367
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,080
in line, do as you're told or die.

368
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:51,000
It's when you think about it, it's really simple and it's kind of it's really dark because

369
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,120
that's what this whole faith is kind of based on is just following it.

370
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,120
You know what I mean?

371
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,400
It's not like, like, I hate to say like paganism is like this like huge umbrella term, but

372
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,240
like these other rights, then they don't operate that way.

373
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,560
There is no like, you better do this or else.

374
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,560
It's only within this biblical religion that you get that.

375
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:24,840
And it's so opposite of classical civilization, the drive towards investigation and study

376
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:31,560
and argumentation, you know, it's so contrary to that.

377
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,800
There isn't, there is an implied reason in pagan religion.

378
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,840
It's like when somebody tells you, don't believe what you're seeing, right?

379
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,640
Don't, don't, it's just bad press that's giving you this impression.

380
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,200
That's what Christianity does.

381
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,240
It says, don't use your reason.

382
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:54,760
Well, you know, you don't, I noticed about that too, multi polytheism, right?

383
00:21:54,760 --> 00:22:00,640
Multiple gods, you give your devote devotion to the God that you align with, the God that

384
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,840
you look at, that you look up to, that you need help from.

385
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:11,360
But in monotheism, it's sort of, monotheism sort of aligns the world in a way that makes

386
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,360
it so that you have one king or one Caesar or one emperor.

387
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:21,760
And underneath that one emperor is the footstool, the world, the Roman empire, and everyone

388
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,400
is a servant to this one emperor.

389
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,680
That's why all of a sudden when you get this Christian Byzantine empire, it's, it's really

390
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,920
just like, all of it's privately owned by the Caesar, by, by the emperor, by the Constantine

391
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,160
or whoever, like, you know, all these different Constantine the six and Constantine the seventh

392
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:46,480
and, and just keeps going until another, and like, you can come get it from me, come get

393
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,480
it from me.

394
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,520
Like if you can assert this throne, you can have this world, but until then it's mine.

395
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:57,440
And these legions are mine, they're going to do what I say, and my will is be done.

396
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:04,440
And it, it follows the monotheistic religion that it's operating within.

397
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:13,360
So the religion sort of sets the tone of how the society operates, whatever theocracy,

398
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,720
like in the, and like, I, you know, I sound like I'm people, people will always say, but

399
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,160
you act like the pagan world is so perfect.

400
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,880
There were still problems, of course there was, but like, at least within this world

401
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,520
where you have all these different deities and different temples and, you know, the

402
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,800
temple of Ephesus was Artemis, the temple of Athena, the Acropolis, at least in this

403
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:42,360
world, it seems to be, there's, there was more, like you said, there's more debates,

404
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:48,360
more discussion, more, more diverse, like more, more metropolitan-y feeling going on.

405
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,640
You know, what is your thoughts on that?

406
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,640
And I could be wrong.

407
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,520
I think what you're describing is not the gang, right?

408
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,200
The gang, we have to have a certain code and we have to have a certain color and we have

409
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:07,200
to have a certain ethnicity and we take orders up and we don't question, we just kill, right?

410
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,040
That's the gang mentality.

411
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,320
And I think Christianity is very much, that's because when you, when you said it, gangster

412
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,520
Jesus, I thought, wow, Neil, you've captured it.

413
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,360
It is.

414
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,520
When you have paganism, on the other hand, there is no overriding authority.

415
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,240
There's no one central person who can tell you what's what.

416
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:27,880
Yeah.

417
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,800
I mean, think about it.

418
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,640
Paganism expressed itself in the chorus.

419
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,280
A chorus is a group of people who come together and sing and dance.

420
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,800
I mean, what is more, you know, what is more democratic than that?

421
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,760
The Christians did not.

422
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,280
And even Zeus, even Zeus doesn't have all the power.

423
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:52,720
Like Zeus might, might get, Eros might have power over Zeus or Athena might have power.

424
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,640
There's, there's different situations where sometimes Zeus doesn't have the

425
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,520
authority just to do whatever he wants.

426
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,040
Yeah.

427
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,960
So there is that, there's that.

428
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:09,840
I feel like that, that aspect kind of dictates the culture in a, in a really

429
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,040
effective way when you have that one authority on top, everyone follows suit.

430
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,960
Better do what that one authority says or else.

431
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,160
Yeah.

432
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,920
And it's funny because when the, when the Ottomans come and take

433
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,920
Constance and Opal, Mehmed II, what does he do?

434
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,400
He says, I'm Caesar now.

435
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,960
He just wants, he wants to continue playing the same game.

436
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,440
He's not changing anything up.

437
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,280
He just, we're Muslim now, but, but I'm going to be Caesar.

438
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,000
Even, even ask the Pope, call me Caesar.

439
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,320
Pope, the Pope's like, no, bro.

440
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,800
But like, well, you still, he's, they're, they're playing the same game.

441
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,480
Yeah.

442
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,200
And it's kind of, it's kind of crazy to think about the world.

443
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,640
Like that's how the world was for a long time.

444
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,040
What's the difference between a crusade and a gang war?

445
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,400
You know, it's always over, it's always over capital of some support, some, you

446
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:09,920
know, uh, some kind of rights to be able to run this black market in this area.

447
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,000
You know what I mean?

448
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,840
It's always just like, look at the, look at the history of the crusades.

449
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,440
It's the same thing.

450
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,680
It's the flow.

451
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,080
There is no ideal.

452
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,880
People that think crusaders were ideal, idealistic, um, you know,

453
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,640
I'm going to go fight for Jesus.

454
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,640
And there are people who have that soldier of Christ mentality today.

455
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,800
Let me tell you something.

456
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,680
There's no such thing as a crusade.

457
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,880
Crusades are just wars over turf and cash.

458
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,200
Right.

459
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,960
That's, that's all they are.

460
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,160
So I don't, I don't, I don't understand why, um, people can't see the

461
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,880
thuggery that's behind Christianity.

462
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,240
That's why Neil, I'm still really impressed that you made.

463
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,960
Well, the, the Godfather, what do you think a Pope is?

464
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,240
He's the, he's the Godfather.

465
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,200
This is, I mean, it's like literally the same thing.

466
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,040
Yeah.

467
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,320
You know, what's the difference?

468
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,240
You know, it's my ring, man.

469
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:05,720
Yeah.

470
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,760
On your knee.

471
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,280
Do what you told.

472
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,600
Lovely.

473
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,120
Let's go to the next source.

474
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,880
Let me see if I got any more cool gang.

475
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,480
All right.

476
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,360
So we have angels or slaves.

477
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:16,800
We got that.

478
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,560
We did that one, right?

479
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,480
Yeah.

480
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,480
Good.

481
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,560
Here we go.

482
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:21,640
Yeah.

483
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,240
Yeah.

484
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,080
That's the next one.

485
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,920
Let's go to the next one.

486
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,160
Yeah.

487
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,440
Yeah.

488
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:27,960
Yeah.

489
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,320
Okay.

490
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:28,720
Yeah.

491
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,120
Okay.

492
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,400
So for all of these people, look, it gives off a list, right?

493
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,040
Of people and notice right at the top, it's apistos.

494
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,280
These are people who don't subscribe to your notion of faith, right?

495
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,760
These are the people who don't just subscribe to your notion of faith.

496
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,400
So that's anybody.

497
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:51,000
We're not just talking about people think this is a list of bad things to do,

498
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,640
like murder, right?

499
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,840
Murder and, and lying.

500
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,160
These are bad things.

501
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,000
So Jesus is the good guy.

502
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,880
He doesn't follow it.

503
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,520
No, no, no.

504
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:06,120
He's saying anybody that doesn't follow us is abominable.

505
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,160
Yeah.

506
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,880
They're murderers, right?

507
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,680
They're, they're pharmacists.

508
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,480
Look, they're drug experts.

509
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,360
They're drug users.

510
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,320
They are wizard sorcerers.

511
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,600
He's calling everybody that, right?

512
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,400
And saying they're idolaters.

513
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,440
They're those image casters, right?

514
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,640
And by the way, he says the liars got no part.

515
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:31,800
Yeah.

516
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,480
The liars got no part.

517
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,880
Yeah.

518
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:35,720
Yeah.

519
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,120
They're going to be put in a lake.

520
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,440
Think of that imagery, though, a lake, which you burn it with fire and brimstone.

521
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,200
Yeah.

522
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,200
Now that sounds like that sounds like the pit of Tartarus, doesn't it?

523
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,320
Yeah.

524
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,440
No, this is the purging, right?

525
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,280
That Phaeoi, that, that brimstone that you're talking about.

526
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,240
Yeah, that's a powerful purgative.

527
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,240
Yeah.

528
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,760
And they're going to burn with it.

529
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,160
They're going to be purified in hell, right?

530
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,000
And that's the second death.

531
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,560
That's what you call the second death.

532
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,200
This is what Jesus brings.

533
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,480
This promise that if he comes back and you're not one of the faithful, right?

534
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,120
This is what you get.

535
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,240
So right away you got, um, look, there's no loving.

536
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,000
Here, where'd the loving go, right?

537
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,120
And evangelicals have such a good way of pulling that, of excusing this, right?

538
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,560
Of pulling this out of the hat.

539
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,240
They say, Oh, well, just the age of grace is over.

540
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,160
I'm a dominionist and the age of grace is over.

541
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,280
And, and that's why all of a sudden, no, no, no, let's just tell me what you've got.

542
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:51,880
You've got a picture of Jesus slaughtering all of humanity, all of humanity.

543
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,440
You know, I thought about this.

544
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,480
I thought about this.

545
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,800
And then even if Christian turned out to be true, which it's not, but let's just,

546
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,000
let's play along with this.

547
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,480
Even if this, this scenario actually comes about, I'm going, I'm saying sending

548
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,360
in that lake of fire.

549
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,200
I don't, this, this unit, this, this reality that you created, you're evil.

550
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,560
I'm not going to spend eternity at your feet worshiping you for this.

551
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,080
Yeah.

552
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,000
Kill me now.

553
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,080
And I'm done.

554
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:26,560
I, I'm out of this game because this is just, and it's like, you created me this

555
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:26,840
way.

556
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,600
So I don't know what your deal is.

557
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,520
You're the one that needs, this is, this is a you problem.

558
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,160
Get rid of me.

559
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,600
I'm done.

560
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,080
I don't care.

561
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,240
I'm like, that's to me is just evil.

562
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,320
I'm hoping, I'm hoping Neil that it's real as it can be.

563
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,760
So I can stand right in front of them.

564
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:50,800
And when it comes my moment of judgment, creamer, and they talk about the great

565
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:55,440
white throne and his judgment, I'm looking forward to standing right there.

566
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:01,480
I feel the same way for the great white throne and saying, you were arrested

567
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,320
with a naked boy.

568
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,200
I'm not following.

569
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,600
I wish I was behind you to watch it too.

570
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,640
I hope I don't go in front of you.

571
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,120
So I don't get to, I don't miss it.

572
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,080
Yeah.

573
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:14,920
Yeah.

574
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,280
Let's see what else is going to happen to us.

575
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,600
Because the next quote.

576
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,360
Fire from Urino's.

577
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,240
Yeah.

578
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,440
And she'll go out to see the nations, which are in the, oh, in the four quarters

579
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,960
of the earth, Gog and Magog to gather them together to battle.

580
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,160
The number of whom is as the same as the sea.

581
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,440
And they went up on the breadth of the earth and compass the camp of the saints

582
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,880
about these are the bad guys, right?

583
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,000
That's, that's us.

584
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,760
It's everybody who's not faithful and the beloved city.

585
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,520
And they came from and fire from came down from God out of heaven.

586
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:51,440
This is that poor Urino's and notice it's got the Gog and Magog reference in

587
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,280
it, which all the evangelicals are going to be standing up saying, oh my God,

588
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,520
he's talking about Gog and Magog, right?

589
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,320
Gog, if you go back to Ezekiel, which I've gotten the bottom.

590
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,160
And you're going to say, wait a minute, you're not reading the Hebrew.

591
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,120
Yeah, you're right.

592
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,120
I'm reading the oldest version we have.

593
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,720
And you, son of man, son of man.

594
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,160
Now you know where he stole the title from, right?

595
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,640
Right.

596
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,320
That's from Ezekiel.

597
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:25,640
Yep.

598
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,080
Yeah.

599
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:32,320
Prophecy against Gog and say the Lord says these things.

600
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,440
He do look.

601
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,600
I am Episay.

602
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,360
I am against you.

603
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:42,440
Gog, the ruler of Ross, Ross.

604
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,200
And what is Ross?

605
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,960
Ross is later, uh, Ruth's on the Latin side.

606
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:55,040
These are the people who live, um, where we now talk about Russians.

607
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,000
Oh, yeah.

608
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,160
So, so when the Christian evangelicals get all, especially the, the dominionists

609
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,280
and those guys, and it's mostly guys because they hate women.

610
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,200
They're misogynists.

611
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:12,360
Um, it's built in, it's built into the DNA of the gang of Christianity.

612
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,680
Um, and they just happen to bring it out.

613
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,360
Those guys just happened to bring this before Doug Wilson is in that group.

614
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:24,680
Anyway, anyway, um, they bring out this, uh, uh, hatred.

615
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,960
It's a, it's a living hatred, but they say also, Oh, this, the Russians, right?

616
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,120
You notice the Christians are all excited about the Russians and they're like,

617
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,440
Hey, don't help Ukraine.

618
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,280
Right.

619
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:41,680
You know, I know, I know Christians on Twitter, Catholics and Baptist, both of them.

620
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,080
And they, and those people hate each other, but they, they're coming together

621
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:50,200
and backing up Russia because Putin, cause they all, they all understand something.

622
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,080
They all understand something that's really real.

623
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:58,480
That the Orthodox church of Russia has a better claim to the, to the, to the

624
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,880
Greek Orthodox church than, than the Catholic church does.

625
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:06,920
They have a better claim to Peter and Paul than, than Rome does right now.

626
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,440
That's the Orthodox church of Russia right now.

627
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:16,160
That's the original church that fled Constantinople in 1453 and a century

628
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:23,600
later, Ivan the terrible, his grandmother was the niece of the last Roman emperor.

629
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,880
Who flew, who died during the siege of Constantinople.

630
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,000
So you have a direct lineage.

631
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,440
That's why he called up the czar.

632
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,000
He's the first czar of Russia.

633
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:36,640
Yeah.

634
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,600
The Kaiser.

635
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,520
He's making us up.

636
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,840
He was, he was saying, I'm, I'm legitimately tracing myself back to the

637
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,920
Constantine dynasty.

638
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,400
Oh man.

639
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,000
That's so arouses me.

640
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,480
That's so arouses me.

641
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,840
Uh, so tell me a little, tell me a little bit more about these people.

642
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,960
So they tell you, they're like, Hey, in support of the roost.

643
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,240
Did, um, did you know what side you're on?

644
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,480
That's why I like this.

645
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:07,320
That's why I, I understand why these Christians, these Twitter Catholics are

646
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,040
like, Putin did nothing wrong.

647
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,480
I get why they're like that.

648
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,200
You're, you're right.

649
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:11,760
You're damn right.

650
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,480
You're on that side.

651
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,640
You should be on that side.

652
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,720
Let's get real.

653
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,320
You're, that's the side you're supposed to be on.

654
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,080
Yeah.

655
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,960
I'm supposed to be on the other side, the side of democracy, the side of Athena.

656
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,040
Yeah.

657
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,040
My own family wants everybody to die.

658
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,560
Right.

659
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:32,840
I mean, we all have family like this who are evangelicals or steeped in the

660
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,840
conservative fundamentalist Christianity or somehow influenced by it.

661
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:44,160
They want Vlad to sweep down and surround Israel because that's when Jesus is

662
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,280
coming back and according to them, right?

663
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,680
According to their bull, their BS, um, can't read the original text approach.

664
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,160
Right.

665
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:59,240
And, and they, that's why, you know, the Christians actually say now, people should

666
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,520
know this, this is a public service I'm doing.

667
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,240
Right.

668
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,400
People, people should know that the Christians are saying that there is no

669
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,720
America in the book of revelation.

670
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:12,800
Right.

671
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,960
There's no America.

672
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:22,080
So America must really fall before Vlad can sweep down and surround Israel.

673
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,480
Cause when he does that, the bear, when the bear does that, the text calls him,

674
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:32,200
then Jesus can crack, come in the world and boom, murder and mayhem can

675
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:37,680
take, take off like a, and they're going to push to get those things done so that

676
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,560
they can legitimately say, it's my religion.

677
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,320
I got to follow it.

678
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,280
I got to do as it's my religion.

679
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,480
And so, and that's why you get this push against degeneracy.

680
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:53,400
So they call it putans, putan cleaning up the degenerates, those degenerates, you

681
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,200
know, all those, all those, uh, those degenerate, uh, atheists and, and all

682
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:03,240
those, uh, you know, all those gays and all those LGBTQ degenerate.

683
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:09,000
That's what that, that this is what this is, this is their, this is the way they

684
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,720
see the world.

685
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,360
Yeah.

686
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:16,520
And so putan as out to them is on the, on the side of, of God in there to them.

687
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,440
Well, we know, we know it's, it's, he's, he's evil.

688
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,040
We know that.

689
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,120
You gotta know by the fact that he blows people up randomly with rockets, you

690
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,560
know, like mothers and children.

691
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,440
I mean, this is what I don't get.

692
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,360
You know, Jesus says directly, I'm going to take all those liars and I'm going

693
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,600
to feed them to the birds.

694
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,480
He's such a good gangster leader.

695
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:39,920
You know what I mean?

696
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,520
He's such a good mob boss.

697
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:48,160
He's like, Peter, Peter, take those people and feed them to the birds.

698
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:48,960
Right.

699
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,120
We, I mean, there's, there's nothing better than this.

700
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:52,760
What?

701
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,680
Yeah.

702
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,360
Yeah.

703
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:02,040
And I saw an angel right standing in the sun and he shouted in a great voice

704
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:07,040
saying, um, to all the birds flying around in midair.

705
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,720
He says, come now soon.

706
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:15,000
Assemble at the banquet, the great banquet of God.

707
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,200
And it goes on.

708
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,880
The text goes on to talk about feeding us to these birds.

709
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,160
Yeah.

710
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,880
Feeding us to these birds.

711
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,640
That's where we're going.

712
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:32,320
So it doesn't, it, it only makes sense that modern evangelicals can say, um,

713
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,920
what Putin is doing is good.

714
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,320
We can excuse lies.

715
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,120
Have you noticed Christianity that yells?

716
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,880
I heard the guy debating you talking about moral authority.

717
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:42,520
Right.

718
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,080
They think, oh, I'm for family values and moral authority.

719
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,280
You got none.

720
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:54,320
You got zero because you will take a liar and exalt, bring up that

721
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,400
liar to a position and you will bow to a liar.

722
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,320
And we all know, we all know that those liars get fed to those birds.

723
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,080
Right.

724
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,880
That's the life, right?

725
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,880
That's what I thought about this.

726
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:14,200
I thought about this hard is that I actually have this weird respect.

727
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:20,680
And I hate to say this, but like, at least the fundamentalist are consistent

728
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,440
and following what the text tells them, where you have these people on the

729
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:30,680
sidelines who I don't respect, who cherry pick and it's like a buffet of the

730
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,640
Bible's a buffet where they can just, I like this part.

731
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,880
I don't, I don't like that part.

732
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,400
So I'm going to somehow pretend it's not there or, or even just rationalize

733
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,840
it away by explaining it how I want to explain it.

734
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:48,240
And then you, and then what you're doing is you want, you are making it so

735
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,800
that the fundamentalists can stay legitimate.

736
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,360
Because if you, if you just, if the people on the sidelines who, who are

737
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:01,040
the moderates who are, you know, using the Bible, like, like a, like a salad bar,

738
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,920
if they actually just said, you know what, this, this text is, this text is

739
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,560
just evil.

740
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,360
I'm out of here.

741
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,920
Then there were, then the fundamentals would be looking like looking naked

742
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,040
in the middle of the street.

743
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,120
They would just be target, like they would be wide open.

744
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,480
There'd be no one to cover for them.

745
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,320
They'd have nothing.

746
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,320
That's cause they're the reason why that the, the fundamentalists are still around.

747
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,520
People, you get the moderates.

748
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,440
Do people push you, um, like to say, Oh, don't be so hard on the Christians.

749
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,360
You ever get any comment?

750
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,720
Like, don't, all the time.

751
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,200
Yeah.

752
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:41,000
You know what, but I was, I was, I went, I was at a church for years.

753
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:49,800
That really has an impact that really is like pushing, pushing ideas into the

754
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:56,000
world that are really negative impact, climate change, El Pro, uh, accepting

755
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,560
people who they are, all that stuff goes out the window.

756
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,680
And this is, these are churches at every corner that you can think of.

757
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,120
Like this is every city, every town has that.

758
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,280
It's not, it's not a small thing.

759
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,120
It's a big thing.

760
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,000
It's a big, it's a big pop.

761
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,600
It's a big population of people that are pushing these ideas.

762
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,440
I'm sorry, but I'm just going to, that's, that's where I'm at right now.

763
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,600
If you can convince me otherwise, but I've seen it, seen it first hand.

764
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,480
I know what I was, I was one of the people who, on the email list for January 6th,

765
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,560
say, Hey, everybody, we, if you need to bust, if you need to ride there, we'll

766
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,320
send you out there.

767
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,000
We need to support Trump.

768
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,360
I was one of those people who were on that email list.

769
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,120
I'm just saying, so I'm coming out of that world.

770
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,600
So that's why I do what I do.

771
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,200
You don't have to do it, but I do it, you know?

772
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,040
Yeah.

773
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,480
And it was a Christian flag that was first, you know, everybody listened to

774
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,760
what Neil said, right?

775
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,920
It was a Christian flag that went first into that, into that capital.

776
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:55,400
Those people, Neil, that tell you you're, you're being too harsh on the Christians.

777
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:56,880
Right.

778
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:03,480
Um, those are the people who in the first century AD, as Christianity was becoming

779
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:09,400
more and more radicalized, and people were saying, we have to burn down this

780
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,600
place, right, in order to get him to come back.

781
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:19,760
Um, that's the kind of, that's the kind of the person who stood back at the time

782
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,880
and said, Oh, don't be hard on the Christians.

783
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:28,680
That was the person who, uh, helped facilitate the fall, um, of Rome.

784
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,280
They, an order.

785
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,200
And when I say Rome, I mean, order.

786
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,120
That's a good point.

787
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,200
That was such a good point.

788
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,080
Exactly.

789
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,000
It's what I'm saying.

790
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,920
It's, it's the people who are the moderates that kind of cover for the

791
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,920
fundamentalist types that, that do the most damage.

792
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:47,480
Right.

793
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,440
Cause without, it's like that you, you're the gateway to that path.

794
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,800
You're the reason why that, that thing exists.

795
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:54,360
Yeah.

796
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:54,880
Yeah.

797
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,160
You know, you know, when the Taliban was, was gaining strength in Afghanistan, you

798
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:05,760
know, that there were a certain percentage of a population that said, Oh,

799
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,680
this is, this can't be that bad, right?

800
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:17,600
Whereas, uh, so it's, if we can, if, if we can, uh, show those people the future,

801
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,960
um, before it happens, they can correct, but that's unfortunate.

802
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,920
You know, unless you've got, unless you've got oracles and different sources,

803
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:32,800
you were talking earlier about polytheism, remember, people don't think this way,

804
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:38,680
but there's, uh, uh, there are oracles spread all over the place that give you

805
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:43,640
the voice of God, whether it's she or he, right?

806
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,400
It doesn't matter.

807
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:51,000
Um, and you can go obtain that voice in one place that's different from another.

808
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:59,400
That inherent flexibility of the system, of a system that is, uh, integrates the

809
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,320
populace that thrives on diversity, right?

810
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:03,880
That's what I'm saying.

811
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:13,120
That the, the layout of that system sort of produces, uh, a zeitgeist.

812
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,880
That's, that's not top bottom.

813
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,080
It's not patriarchal.

814
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:21,520
It's not, here's the one, one king on top and then the servants.

815
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,080
It's more like spread out.

816
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,800
You have these different, different institutions with their own certain types

817
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,960
of power that there's a balance happening.

818
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:32,720
You know what I mean?

819
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,920
More of a balance.

820
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,600
Balance.

821
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,160
That's a, that's a Greek idea, right?

822
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,000
Not, not today invented it, but that was big in their minds.

823
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,440
You have to achieve balance and become in thug life where you're selling

824
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,760
everything that you own and putting it at the feet of some thug who's going to

825
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,200
murder you if you don't give it all up.

826
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:53,840
Look at that.

827
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,280
Right.

828
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,560
By the way, how did people, how did Peter know that he didn't give it all up

829
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:04,360
unless he either had spies where he had access to the sale itself, which since Jesus

830
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:09,760
was so hooked into the, to the tax collectors, it's probably likely that

831
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,880
Peter knew exactly cause that, all of that has to be registered.

832
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,360
But not only that, it's a message to the next person coming.

833
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,680
So you remember what happened to Ann and I.

834
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,400
Is there enough, you better give me all that money.

835
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,600
You better not keep a penny for yourself.

836
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,640
And in eyes, you drop dead right away.

837
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,320
It's like a, it's when a mafia leaves the horse head in the bed.

838
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,360
It's a message.

839
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,120
That's what it is.

840
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,000
It's just a strike fear in the people.

841
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:38,680
Yeah.

842
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,440
If you come here and you join us, you get initiated.

843
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,120
Yeah.

844
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:46,680
You better give us all your riches, sell all your property and don't keep anything

845
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,320
for yourself.

846
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,760
Don't dare do that.

847
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,560
Are you dead?

848
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,320
But that's, that's intense, man.

849
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:58,720
If you are a modern Christian and you own property and you have, I don't know,

850
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,400
stocks, um, and you have a real Christian.

851
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

852
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,200
You are an aberration that developed over 2000 years.

853
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:13,480
Yeah.

854
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,600
The doesn't, doesn't make sense to me, man.

855
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,200
But okay, let's let me get through one more.

856
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,200
We got Ponto Crotor, right?

857
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:21,920
What's this about?

858
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,360
Yeah.

859
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,720
Here's the Ponto Crotor.

860
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:31,560
Remember I said the Ponto Crotor is the title that's used by, um, uh, Hermes,

861
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,920
the Angulos, the messenger of Zeus.

862
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:35,560
Yeah.

863
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,000
Right.

864
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:41,000
Jesus in Revelation, not only calls himself that messenger.

865
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:41,720
He's the other.

866
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:47,680
But even the text itself, John says another angel, Jesus comes out at one

867
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,960
point, um, uh, with a sickle in his hand, we're going to look at it in a minute.

868
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,080
And then another, it says another angel steps out with a sickle.

869
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:01,680
So Jesus is very much putting himself into this specific role.

870
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:02,640
Right.

871
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,240
What's he got a sickle for?

872
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,480
You know what he's got a sickle for to cut your guts out.

873
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:09,640
Yeah.

874
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,240
Yeah.

875
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,040
And what are they all yelling?

876
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,200
You know, Jesus is Lord, et cetera, et cetera.

877
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:14,800
Okay.

878
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,360
Next one.

879
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:17,680
Kai.

880
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:18,160
Yeah.

881
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:18,400
Yeah.

882
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,280
And I saw the heaven, the heaven open.

883
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:21,560
Yeah.

884
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,240
Okay.

885
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,960
Here's the description of gangster Jesus.

886
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:25,600
Are you ready?

887
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:31,200
And I looked, I saw the heaven open, open.

888
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:32,440
Yeah.

889
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,340
And look, there was a white horse and there was one seated on the horse called

890
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,460
faithful and, and true.

891
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:47,220
And in his right hand, he holds a, um, sorry, with his right hand.

892
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:47,940
Oh, hang on.

893
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,580
The guy was in a clinic.

894
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,820
Kai polemic.

895
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:57,860
He, um, rules with righteousness and he polemic and he makes war.

896
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,260
He makes war.

897
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,820
Nobody talks about Jesus make war.

898
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,420
We don't have any murals of Jesus, the war maker, right?

899
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:07,580
But this is what characterizes the thug leader.

900
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:09,540
Yes.

901
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:10,100
Right.

902
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:10,500
Right.

903
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,660
He's literally calling himself the war monger.

904
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:13,540
Yeah.

905
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,180
And he's also injected in his eyes.

906
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,620
He's got the flocks.

907
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:22,180
He's got that purple, that burning purple in his eyes and it's the flocks.

908
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:23,060
Poor us.

909
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:27,020
That expression is used in Orphic, uh, mystery.

910
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,820
It's like Al Pacino with this, with the cocaine on his nose.

911
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:30,380
Yeah.

912
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:31,100
Exactly.

913
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:32,380
He's lit up.

914
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:33,700
He's lit up.

915
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,140
This is thanks to Jesus right here.

916
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,900
And he's got lots of gold.

917
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:39,940
He's got bling.

918
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,020
He's got bling.

919
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,020
He's got crowns, right?

920
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:47,460
He's got a ton of bling and he has a name, right?

921
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,340
Jesus has a tat, right?

922
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:50,420
And he has a name.

923
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,220
Oh, yeah, yeah.

924
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:55,620
The next one, the next one, Jesus has a tattoo on his thigh.

925
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:59,100
A name, king of kings and lord of, think about that.

926
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:01,260
You know, you got the old English tattoos.

927
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:02,020
Yeah.

928
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,860
He's got that old Aramaic tattoo going on.

929
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,580
King of kings and lord of lords.

930
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,980
You know, that, uh, but that's what is it?

931
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,380
That siriac, that siriac font.

932
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:14,700
You know what I mean?

933
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,060
He's got that tattoo with that siriac tattoo.

934
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:21,140
Why do you think he, why do you think he tattooed his thigh with it?

935
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,460
Cause he's a G.

936
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,980
He's Jesus, the G.

937
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,500
He's G-man.

938
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:26,180
Yeah.

939
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:27,340
Yeah.

940
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:34,900
This is so, this is so, I honestly, when you look at it this way though,

941
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,700
it almost makes sense.

942
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,860
It makes better sense.

943
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:42,420
It does.

944
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:43,340
The fairy tale.

945
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:44,260
Better sense.

946
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:44,700
Yeah.

947
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:45,740
That they come up with.

948
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:50,180
Can you imagine him flashing it like he lifts up his, he lifts up his gown and

949
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,380
he's like, Hey, take a look at this.

950
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:53,780
You know, in my fur.

951
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:57,740
Oh, and it's funny because they're ride or die.

952
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:58,500
They're martyrs.

953
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,220
They're going to ride or die for their click, for their gang.

954
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:04,580
They're not going to, you're not letting them, you're not going to get over on them.

955
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,340
They're going to die for that shit.

956
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:13,660
Like that's a mentality that you see in the mafia and the Italian and the Spanish

957
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:16,380
and like that's a, that's real.

958
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,500
Like that's, that's no joke.

959
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:26,260
And imagine though, you've got this drug using gang who's, who's, uh, who's

960
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:31,300
principal leaders or, or immune to Venoms, right?

961
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:35,580
And Jesus is like, I'll make you so that you can drink this stuff and it won't

962
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:37,380
hurt you at all, right?

963
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,740
So, you know, the drugs are there from the beginning.

964
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:42,580
You know, the drugs are there with them when he gets arrested.

965
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,780
So it's a part of the culture.

966
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:49,180
Your comparison to gang is, I think it's straight on, man.

967
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:52,100
Look at how the popes dictated their lives.

968
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:56,220
Like the, they had the Pope Alexander in the 16th, 15th century.

969
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:01,540
He had an enemy that wanted to be the pope and this guy does become pope.

970
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:03,700
It's Pope Julius.

971
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:07,740
He has two popes later, but this pope didn't want, didn't want to wait around.

972
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:10,220
He wanted to end this pope's life so he can become the next pope.

973
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:16,100
Well, he, he ended up apparently, according to the sources, he, uh, he had

974
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:20,340
an, uh, altar boy child and he was giving him poison every day.

975
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,660
Enough that it wouldn't kill him, but he would become immune to it.

976
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:28,100
And then he got him hired as the pope's wine checker.

977
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:33,020
So he would be able to drink the wine and poison in it and he wouldn't die.

978
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,100
Well, the whole operation failed.

979
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:35,740
The kid died.

980
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:41,660
But like that, but that tells you the mindset of this church, man.

981
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,500
This is like, these are like mafia bosses fighting over the throne.

982
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:46,340
Yeah.

983
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:50,860
And they're, when this is, this is the highest, highest Christianity has to

984
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:55,100
offer the papacy and the world, they're operating like my bosses.

985
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,420
Why do you think that is?

986
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,380
You think it's just a reality.

987
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:04,260
You know, it's just like, that's the way the things go when you got lots of money

988
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:09,740
involved and lots of power and sex, you know, you just, it's going to lean

989
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:14,020
toward this hierarchy of there's going to be one thug and he's going to run

990
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:14,860
everything.

991
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:15,740
Right.

992
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:19,660
So yeah, I didn't think, you know, I didn't think they were sitting around.

993
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,340
Ha, ha, ha, ha, right.

994
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:25,900
I, I didn't think that was the reason everybody was there.

995
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:26,260
Right.

996
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:29,980
We all know it's, you can take those altar boys into the basement.

997
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:31,420
You know what I mean?

998
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:34,340
And you can do things with that's power.

999
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:35,380
That's what they're asking.

1000
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,180
That's real power, man.

1001
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,380
Jesus has that.

1002
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:42,140
Let me see that, that long, that long one that I had with him on the white

1003
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,700
horse, just go back one.

1004
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:46,540
No, maybe it's one more.

1005
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,300
No, that's okay.

1006
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:49,700
That's okay.

1007
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:50,780
Let's just, I'm sorry.

1008
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:51,140
This one.

1009
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,340
Yeah, there we go.

1010
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:52,700
Yeah.

1011
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:55,820
And he's going to, he's going to destroy the nations, man.

1012
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:56,900
He's going to rule them.

1013
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,860
Says below, he's going to rule them.

1014
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,820
And there's a little phrase in Rob doi.

1015
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:08,540
See, did I, it's with a rod of iron, but that Rob done people don't recognize

1016
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:10,700
that Rob done is a religious instrument.

1017
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:13,620
It's used also by the Balkans, right?

1018
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,460
And his is made of iron.

1019
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:16,180
You know why?

1020
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:18,940
So he can bang, bust your head open with it.

1021
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,860
That's gangster.

1022
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:23,180
This Jesus seated on a white horse.

1023
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,900
He's gangster brought.

1024
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:29,300
And by the way, we see in the beginning, he's got his bow and he's got that poison

1025
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:29,740
with him.

1026
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:32,580
So, and here again, he's called the Pantocrontor.

1027
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:34,740
Oh, but one last thing from this.

1028
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:38,180
Look at one, two, three, four, five lines from the bottom.

1029
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:39,900
This is in verse 19.

1030
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:43,540
Yeah, it says, pate tein leinon.

1031
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,660
He is treading the wine press.

1032
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,460
That leinon is the wine press.

1033
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:54,500
And you should have one, Neil, that is the hymn to Linnaean Dionysus.

1034
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:55,700
Yeah, look at this.

1035
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:56,180
Look at this.

1036
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,540
They call him Lyceus, right?

1037
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:00,180
The releaser, the freer, right?

1038
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:04,420
The, that lane route is the press for the wine.

1039
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:09,460
And for those of you who think for those of you who think that they were

1040
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:12,180
you know, God is comparing himself.

1041
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,700
He's constantly saying, I'm this wine presser.

1042
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:18,180
They didn't have wine, except in Canaan.

1043
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:22,300
The Egyptians got it from the Canaanites, right?

1044
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:27,580
Because in Canaan, which is not a Semitic word, it's a Hurrian word.

1045
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:31,300
It's a Hurrian word and they were not Indo-European.

1046
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,780
And it means, guess what it means?

1047
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,260
It means purple.

1048
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,820
Yeah, I've seen this before.

1049
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:38,460
That's mind blowing.

1050
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:42,340
Yeah, yeah, at the bottom, at the bottom, I just want you to

1051
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:46,180
notice the last nine here, Rhexikhthon and Linnaean.

1052
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:50,500
Linnaean is that God who treads out the grapes, right?

1053
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,740
That's from Revelation.

1054
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:53,340
And this is talking about Dionysus.

1055
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,540
This isn't a hymn to Dionysus.

1056
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,260
What is that word being Megasthenus?

1057
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,180
And the second last word, Megasthenus.

1058
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,500
Having incredible strength.

1059
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:02,340
Oh, OK.

1060
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,140
Nye is having incredible strength.

1061
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,100
He's Rhexikhthon.

1062
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:12,340
He is literally busting the earth or jamming something into the earth.

1063
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:17,500
And guess what we have in one of these texts that I sent you, Nyeal,

1064
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:24,900
it talks about Jesus with the Saturnian scythe or sickle jamming it down

1065
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:25,980
into the earth.

1066
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,380
Yeah.

1067
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:30,180
Oh, yeah, here it is.

1068
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:34,540
I see, behold, the white cloud and upon the cloud sat one unto the

1069
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:40,740
Son of Man, having on his head a golden crown, a crusone, and the

1070
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:44,900
Stefanon, crusone Stefanon, and in his hand a sharp sickle.

1071
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:46,820
Drepanon.

1072
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:48,620
Yeah, yeah.

1073
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:55,820
He's got that sickle and he's about to jam it into the earth as his judgment,

1074
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:56,140
right?

1075
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:58,780
This is the exact same thing that Dionysus does.

1076
00:55:58,820 --> 00:55:59,820
I'm not kidding you.

1077
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:06,260
For hundreds of years, the workers of Bacchus, they would hear this

1078
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:08,140
and they'd be like, oh, yeah, he's Bacchus.

1079
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:12,020
Yeah, that's that's what I'm trying to know.

1080
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,020
So that's what I learned from you.

1081
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:17,060
And this is what I'm trying to relate to people is that the language

1082
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:19,700
in Greek in any doesn't matter what it is.

1083
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:27,060
When you're speaking Celtic language in in Greek, it's going to ring bells

1084
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,940
in people's ears in the Greek world, especially people

1085
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:35,220
living in Phrygia, people living in Corinth or the church at Thessalonica.

1086
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,900
These people are growing up in the Orphic mysteries.

1087
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:38,980
They're all around them.

1088
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:43,180
This is this is stuff that's this is familiar language to them.

1089
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:47,940
And we lose this context when we, because we're in an English-speaking

1090
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,380
world that's a thousand years removed from this.

1091
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:52,620
We have no idea the context anymore.

1092
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:56,780
It's gone, but that's what this is the work you've been doing that I'm

1093
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,500
trying to trying to give to the people.

1094
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:03,860
Like there's some context in this reason why they're using this language.

1095
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:06,780
Sure, that's Saturnian.

1096
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:09,140
Yeah, it's Kronos has the sickle.

1097
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:12,940
He's the one who comes in, you know, they have the Thanatos, the God of death.

1098
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:14,900
This this is all in Revelation.

1099
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:18,780
It's not like this is not like I'm pulling out of the airs.

1100
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:23,220
He even says Thanatos death and Hades gave up their dead and then

1101
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:24,540
they're throwing them like a fire.

1102
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:25,340
Right.

1103
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:27,980
And even in the Christian, even in the Christian

1104
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:32,940
manuscript or in the editions of the New Testament, you'll see Hades

1105
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,900
capitalized, right?

1106
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:37,300
Because he he's a person.

1107
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:39,340
He's the king of the underworld, right?

1108
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:42,580
And even see where it says the sea gave up its dead.

1109
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:44,700
Yeah, I'm not I'm not kidding.

1110
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:49,140
When I first read that, I remember thinking like, well, you have Hades

1111
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:52,540
and you have you have death and Hades, the sea.

1112
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:56,420
And I didn't know until recently, when I started reading the Orphic hymns,

1113
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,900
there was a hymn to thought Thosala.

1114
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,660
Yeah, him to the sea.

1115
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,300
The sea is also a deity.

1116
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:03,700
Yeah.

1117
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,540
No, they got all there.

1118
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:06,700
It's all in Revelation.

1119
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:07,380
It's all there.

1120
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:09,220
And it's all Saturnian, too.

1121
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:11,740
And that's that's why when you read these hymns, you're shocked.

1122
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:14,260
You're like, wait a minute, they're using the exact same symbols.

1123
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:18,460
The image that they're using in Christianity, which only makes sense.

1124
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:21,500
I mean, come on, they didn't sit around and Jesus didn't say,

1125
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:22,900
let me make up something.

1126
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,420
Yeah, let me just pull out of this.

1127
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:27,220
Pull this out of the out of the void of some black hole.

1128
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:33,340
Like these are ideas that come passed down from other ideas, the evolution.

1129
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:34,940
All ideas come from something.

1130
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:36,820
Yeah. Yeah.

1131
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:38,780
All right, let's finish these quotes because I'm.

1132
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,660
Yeah, these are great.

1133
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:41,860
We're on fire right now.

1134
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:44,020
So this is one Jesus kills and feeds to the birds.

1135
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,180
We did this one, right?

1136
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:46,020
Yeah, we did that one.

1137
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:48,300
Oh, no, here's the one we got to read.

1138
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:48,620
Here's.

1139
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:50,420
Oh, OK.

1140
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:55,740
This is like, this is admitting that you're on some G shit right here.

1141
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:58,140
This is there's no hiding it.

1142
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:01,900
These shall hate the whore and shall make her desolate naked.

1143
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:04,700
She'll ease her flesh and burn her with fire.

1144
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:09,540
For God had put in their hearts to fulfill his will.

1145
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:14,500
Yeah, that's why I like to start with the ending of that one, right?

1146
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,140
Which is at the bottom in Greek.

1147
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:18,700
It literally just says they all said they can.

1148
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:27,740
God gave into their hearts the idea, right, to follow his Nome, right?

1149
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:30,820
His desire and what is his?

1150
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:32,380
What is God's desire then?

1151
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,900
What does he have in his mind to do?

1152
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:39,060
They're going to me say something, they're going to hate her

1153
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:44,980
and they're going to stripper naked and they're going to

1154
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:49,060
consume her flesh.

1155
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:52,700
And this word for flesh, sarks, there's a reason that Paul

1156
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,580
associates it with sexuality.

1157
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:57,700
He says, don't follow the flesh, follow the spirit.

1158
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:01,540
This sarks is the fleshy pulp of a fruit.

1159
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:04,780
When you bite into it and you get all that juice out of it.

1160
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:10,620
That's what that's what they are consuming of her

1161
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:14,700
after she has been thrown into this bed.

1162
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:18,500
Right, she's going to be thrown into this bed and they're going

1163
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:22,780
to cut the calcium, they're going to burn her up in the fire.

1164
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:26,460
Now, this is what's weird, is that cut the cow is used

1165
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:31,740
in religious concept context and it's used to burn that piece

1166
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:36,500
of incense that you get that Smyrna that comes from between the legs

1167
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:41,940
of Aphrodite, you burn that and it creates an odor, right?

1168
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,660
So what is going on?

1169
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:50,460
God is sitting there watching this orgy, this rape orgy, right?

1170
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:56,220
That ends up in her getting totally consumed and it's what's in his mind.

1171
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:59,820
And don't forget, don't forget this, but right before this or not

1172
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:04,700
right before this, a few 15 chapters before this, he's coming out

1173
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:08,620
and saying, nevertheless, talking to the church of Pergamon,

1174
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:13,020
saying that woman, Jezebel, I will cast her on a bed.

1175
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:16,380
And send my minions to rape her.

1176
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:19,180
Yeah, that's the mistranslation in the English.

1177
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:21,940
The Bart Ehrman pointed this out.

1178
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:24,220
And I asked you about it and you were like, he's not on it.

1179
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:27,220
Bart's spot on, that's what the Greek says.

1180
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:30,180
And then it says, I will strike her children dead.

1181
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:33,020
We're murdering children now?

1182
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:37,580
And then he says on the bottom, I'm the morning star.

1183
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:41,580
He say, right after he says, those are the people who will learn

1184
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:45,380
of the deep things of Satan, I'm the morning star.

1185
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:49,820
Yeah, that's like, what's he's saying?

1186
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:51,340
You know, there's Satanists.

1187
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:53,340
No, they had nothing on me.

1188
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:54,620
I'm Lucifer.

1189
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:59,660
Which that's how I'm reading you right now.

1190
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:03,260
But like it's it's what it sounds like.

1191
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:05,460
He moves in on the territory.

1192
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,500
He takes it over.

1193
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,700
He's the new leader, man.

1194
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:09,260
He's the new.

1195
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:11,220
You think you know about this stuff?

1196
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:12,820
Yeah, watch this.

1197
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,580
Yeah, now I'm going to kill you all.

1198
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:20,340
Yeah, this and look at this and look and low.

1199
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:26,700
A lamb stood on the Mount Sion and with him 144,000, having his

1200
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:29,140
father's name written in their foreheads.

1201
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,660
Now here's some more gang stuff right here.

1202
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:36,740
And I heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters, as the voice

1203
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:38,020
of the great thunder.

1204
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:41,540
And I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps.

1205
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,300
There's that Orphic imagery right there.

1206
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:48,380
And they sung as it would the new song before the throne and before

1207
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:52,780
the four beasts and the elders and no man could learn that song.

1208
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:59,260
But the 144,000, which were redeemed, these which were not defiled

1209
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:01,900
with the woman, for they are virgins.

1210
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:06,380
What's Jesus doing with 144,000 virgins?

1211
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:10,460
And I'll bet you they're branded with a with a with a tattoo on their

1212
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:11,340
foreheads.

1213
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:14,060
Yeah, of course they are because they're sex slaves.

1214
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:14,900
Exactly.

1215
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:16,260
That's the whole point of that verse.

1216
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:18,380
Yeah, that's crazy.

1217
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:19,380
Yeah.

1218
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:24,140
And by the way, when it says they are virgins, that's that's not like

1219
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:27,300
physically, that's that's like a cultically.

1220
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:29,140
Like it means like they're mine.

1221
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,500
They only belong to me.

1222
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:31,620
Right.

1223
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:32,460
Am I right about that?

1224
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:34,820
They're Parthenon calls them.

1225
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:35,980
I checked this one out.

1226
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:36,980
They're Parthenon.

1227
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:43,500
So it's it, you know, we talk about Athena Parthenos, right?

1228
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:48,780
I'm saying in the context that he's saying, he's saying that these only

1229
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:50,020
they only belong to me.

1230
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:51,740
Nobody else has access to them.

1231
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:53,100
They're my slaves.

1232
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:54,260
Right, right, right, right.

1233
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:55,900
No, exactly.

1234
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,660
That's exactly that's dark.

1235
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:57,820
Yeah.

1236
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:01,060
That's why it troubles me when he's arrested in the Garden of

1237
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:03,420
Gethsemane at 4 a.m. with a naked boy.

1238
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:08,020
Mark says that that boy was assigned to him, right?

1239
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:15,580
That he was it uses a verb that you only use with slaves and military.

1240
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:16,220
Right.

1241
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:18,900
You can talk about somebody in the military being assigned.

1242
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:19,860
Right.

1243
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:26,620
So it's like what's going on here that Jesus is attracting to himself.

1244
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:32,340
These, you know, slaves who are, you know, in this case, they're virgins.

1245
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:36,460
And, you know, is it and he's yelling, I'm not a pirate.

1246
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:38,020
I'm not a kid trafficker.

1247
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:40,340
You didn't have to come out with the big weapons.

1248
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:41,700
I'm not a kid trafficker.

1249
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:42,380
Right.

1250
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:43,260
Yeah.

1251
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:47,180
Peter, though, what do you think gang wise when Peter took off, right?

1252
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:47,900
Jesus is there.

1253
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:49,140
The boy takes off.

1254
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:55,220
Peter starts swinging with a sword, knocks off that guy's ear and then takes off.

1255
01:04:56,020 --> 01:05:01,820
Uh, do you think it's just like, um, gang lord got taken down, right?

1256
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:06,660
So, uh, we're going to step off and then does Peter just decide along the

1257
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:10,700
way he's like, Hey, I've got the apparatus going here.

1258
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:15,460
I've got enough followers that we can liquidate all of their cash and we can

1259
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:18,980
drive, drive this, this gang forward.

1260
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:19,860
I don't know.

1261
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:20,460
What do you think?

1262
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:22,420
He's the Petros.

1263
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:23,300
He's the rock.

1264
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:24,820
He's the under boss.

1265
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:30,020
He's like under the Godfather, there's that, that, that, that, that, you know,

1266
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:33,620
the main boss that's right underneath and get, he's the one doing that, making

1267
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:35,060
sure everything gets done right.

1268
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:38,860
And so I'm not surprised that he's pulling out a weapon.

1269
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:42,500
Make sure things get done the way it needs to be done.

1270
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,700
Like he can't, you know, and then, and then what happens?

1271
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:45,940
Jesus, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1272
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:46,980
Put it away.

1273
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:48,140
Okay.

1274
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:48,500
Okay.

1275
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:49,380
Boss, you got it.

1276
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:53,180
It's like a scene out of a scene out of a Godfather scene right there.

1277
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:53,740
You know what I mean?

1278
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:55,980
Like put the gun down, Tony.

1279
01:05:56,980 --> 01:06:01,980
That's Petra, but you know, he's the one who ends up starting the church, right?

1280
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:03,620
He was the one who goes to the room.

1281
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:08,980
And, uh, so that's, that's, that's the original Godfather, the first pope right

1282
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:11,700
there, according to the tradition.

1283
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:14,300
Are you muted?

1284
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:18,100
You muted.

1285
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:22,060
Peter ends up in and out of jail too.

1286
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:25,700
So they, they're catching on to what he's doing.

1287
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:31,740
I mean, he, he obviously is making a presence and he's able to get out of jail.

1288
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:34,980
It, it makes you wonder, look, Judas was there, right?

1289
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:38,540
We all know Judas was an informant, right?

1290
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:39,380
No problem.

1291
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:40,420
He's an informant.

1292
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:46,980
How much, to what extent could those three guys that were with Jesus when he got

1293
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:52,220
arrested with that naked kid, what were they, how much could they have been in it?

1294
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:57,980
Do you think Peter could possibly have known that things were going down with

1295
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:58,580
Judas?

1296
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:04,620
Do you think that was, he just tried to make a show like, you know, if he can

1297
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:08,420
kill Anna nice on the spot, he could have killed that guy that he swung at.

1298
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:12,940
Was he just, was he just trying to, you know, make a show or something?

1299
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:15,740
No, I think, I think he was ready.

1300
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:17,820
I think he was ready for something to pop off.

1301
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:18,780
I think there was something.

1302
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:20,740
Yeah, I think you're, I think you're on.

1303
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:22,620
And, and, you know, Dr.

1304
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:27,780
Tabor talks about this is that people want to make it seem like Jesus and Peter

1305
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:31,860
were a bunch of poor fishermen that had no, no, no, no, no.

1306
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:37,140
This is, you know, people don't, people don't remember or talk about or write

1307
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:41,660
about or fixate on people who are just randomly homeless.

1308
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:48,540
Like this is probably some wealthy, like, you know, some sort of movement happening.

1309
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:49,900
There's something going on here.

1310
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:51,620
There's some, this is a movement.

1311
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:57,300
This is not just some little group of people that magically blew up and became

1312
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:59,980
the world, the state religion of the Roman Empire.

1313
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:03,700
This is a systematic movement that's going on.

1314
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:08,700
You've got to think if they, if they become so popular, they spread all

1315
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:09,820
the way over to Rome.

1316
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:10,500
Right.

1317
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:17,020
And if you're thinking that Peter is taking people's goods and redistributing.

1318
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:17,620
Yeah.

1319
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:20,380
And he's, and he's taken everybody.

1320
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:25,500
I mean, how many people, I mean, and it can be anybody, wealthy people, I'm

1321
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,100
sure, also got involved.

1322
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:28,020
Absolutely.

1323
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:32,820
How much, if the movement is so big that it spreads to Rome and throughout Asia

1324
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:36,500
minor, how much did people bring to Peter's feet?

1325
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:40,180
I'll bet he had the most gold on the planet.

1326
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:41,860
Yeah.

1327
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:46,780
Oh, if you have, I'm going to Toronto in two weeks to talk to, uh,

1328
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:50,700
Professor Kloppenborg at Toronto University, he wrote a book about this,

1329
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:55,860
that's called Christ Associations, where he documented, he's looking at all

1330
01:08:55,860 --> 01:09:02,180
like the stellies and stones and, and like, in like imprints in, in catacombs.

1331
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:04,900
And he's putting together the pieces of the puzzle.

1332
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:10,100
And these are like early Christian labor or labor unions, basically.

1333
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:11,820
They're organized.

1334
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:18,220
They're all like the, like the city of Corinth, the stone masons had had a church

1335
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:19,300
and they were organized.

1336
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:24,260
The city of Alexandria, the wood carpenters, they had a church, they were

1337
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:24,620
organized.

1338
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:27,660
This is an organized network of assemblies.

1339
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:31,340
And he even the first thing, the first thing he does in the first chapter is he

1340
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:33,900
redefines that word Ecclesia.

1341
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:37,500
We, we say church, but it really means assembly.

1342
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:40,700
And this, it's a, it's a broader term than just church.

1343
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:44,780
These are groups of people, networks of people that are organized.

1344
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:47,140
There's a reason why they were so successful.

1345
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:48,500
They were organized.

1346
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:53,940
And they say, he says that up until, I guess, in like maybe the second or

1347
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:58,700
third century, if you, if you had a loved one died, you had to go through

1348
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,780
the assemblies and they're most likely Christians.

1349
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:03,020
That's how they got their power.

1350
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:09,700
They took, they infiltrated the, the, the, um, what do you call it?

1351
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:13,900
When someone dies, uh, funeral home places, they were, they were the ones that

1352
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:15,300
infiltrated and took those over.

1353
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:16,740
You know what I mean?

1354
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:20,780
But it kind of reminds me of like today where you see these funeral homes and

1355
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:24,740
they got Italian names and it's like, maybe it's a mafia in front of it.

1356
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:26,220
Like, like it's just like a front.

1357
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:26,740
You know what I mean?

1358
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:27,620
Who knows?

1359
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:28,980
Throwing ideas out there.

1360
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:32,940
No, it makes me wonder what makes me, I'm seriously thinking that though.

1361
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:34,020
I'm not, I'm not getting around.

1362
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:39,660
It makes you wonder how much cash was flowing back to those original

1363
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:44,540
apostles and particularly Peter, because he's named as the keeper of the keys.

1364
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:44,820
Right?

1365
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:45,940
Like that's another thing.

1366
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:52,260
Why is this gangster, uh, Magus, uh, involved with children and prostitutes

1367
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:54,180
and tax collectors?

1368
01:10:54,540 --> 01:11:02,900
Why does he walk around in that, um, in that state saying, Hey, Peter, rock,

1369
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:05,620
um, I'll give you the keys.

1370
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:06,900
What, what is that?

1371
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,140
What the, what does that mean?

1372
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:09,380
Right?

1373
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:14,140
We, we look through the, through the fairytale and we think, Oh,

1374
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:16,460
I'll give you the keys, right?

1375
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:19,460
What the, no, no, what's he, what did he mean when he's going to give him the

1376
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:20,900
keys somehow he did?

1377
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:24,220
Cause Peter ends up making a ton of money off the deal.

1378
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:32,780
He got it, it got to the point where the church of Rome is claiming that they

1379
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:36,460
came from like, this is Peter's thing, right?

1380
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:43,260
Like that's, it's the point that he don't, he's put up as like the successor

1381
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:48,260
almost, if you will, like the book of X starts off before you even get to Paul.

1382
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:50,660
Peter's the one reviving dead people.

1383
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:53,500
He's the one who's Peter resurrects a dead person in the book.

1384
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:55,340
Forget about that.

1385
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:57,100
It's not just Jesus resurrecting dead.

1386
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:58,540
It's also Peter.

1387
01:11:58,540 --> 01:11:59,740
And then Paul does it too.

1388
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:00,620
Yeah.

1389
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:06,340
And he's battling, he's battling that Simon Magus who wants the piece of the

1390
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:08,020
action, he wants any action.

1391
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:11,380
And Peter's like, no, cut him out, cut him out.

1392
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:11,660
Right.

1393
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:14,260
He was a good, he was a good thug, man.

1394
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:17,820
The Simonians were like another rival gang, if you will.

1395
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:21,860
And so the, the, the history gets written by the victors.

1396
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:27,580
The Simonians end up getting written in this, the text where Peter and Simon,

1397
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:30,460
Simon, Magus, they have a show off.

1398
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:31,820
They have a showdown.

1399
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:37,700
It's like a, like a, like a Western gun, like a, you know, bit Billy Barton.

1400
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:41,020
And, and what's his name and badass Billy Joe.

1401
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:44,300
And they're having their little, they got their guns pointed at each other.

1402
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:45,540
And Peter wins.

1403
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:47,620
Peter shoots him down, dead, done.

1404
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:48,700
And that's what happens.

1405
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:51,900
It says in the text that Simon Magus, this is not an act.

1406
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:56,060
This is an apocryphal text, but it says in the apocryphal text that Simon Magus

1407
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:57,900
goes, let's see what you got, bro.

1408
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:01,060
And he starts flying in the air and he's just flying.

1409
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:02,420
Like, look how powerful I am.

1410
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:03,580
Look how much power I got.

1411
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:08,780
And Peter goes, really dog, really dog, boop, and makes them fall down dead.

1412
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:10,580
And then Peter wins, dude.

1413
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:13,300
Like, Peter is more powerful than Simon Magus.

1414
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:15,340
And it's like, that's the message that you get.

1415
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:19,420
But you almost, it almost makes you wonder, what's behind this message?

1416
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:23,620
Or was there, was there a warring factions of Christians in Rome?

1417
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:24,420
I think so.

1418
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:26,980
The archaeology sure as hell shows us this.

1419
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:30,660
The, the evidence shows us this, that there was more than one Christian group

1420
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:35,140
going on in Rome, Simonians read Irenaeus and, and Hippolytus.

1421
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:39,540
They're talking about the Simonians being all over Rome, worshiping Simon Magus

1422
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:40,540
as a Christ.

1423
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:42,460
Simon Magus was the Christ.

1424
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:43,940
Yeah.

1425
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:51,460
He was offering, and he was offering that female avenue as well, that you get

1426
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:54,380
through the or through the Ophites.

1427
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:59,340
You remember in selling his wife, Helen, and entering her into this, all the

1428
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:03,540
stuff that the Nicolations were doing with their, brought with their wives.

1429
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:09,380
Now, if this ecclesia, if this thing that, you know, we say church and we think

1430
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:16,060
fairy tale, huh, and no, if this assembly that starts out is able to, you're able

1431
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:21,980
to have others crop up, other unions crop up in other places that are, have the

1432
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:27,300
same hierarchy and Paul, not as Paul, it's the same gangster stuff.

1433
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:32,420
He's writing the church at Rome saying, Hey, thank you for the donations.

1434
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:32,740
Right.

1435
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:35,180
Thank you for, I understand that you're trying to help me.

1436
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,900
This is what we're doing.

1437
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:37,180
Right.

1438
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:39,260
It's the, we will repay that gesture.

1439
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:39,780
Don't worry.

1440
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:41,260
Oh, the message.

1441
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:43,100
We're, we're, everything's good over here.

1442
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:43,940
Yeah.

1443
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:44,980
Yeah.

1444
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:45,820
That's what it is.

1445
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:46,780
Hmm.

1446
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:51,180
And he's so hyped up on drugs for those of you like Paul and I'm talking to all

1447
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:56,100
the, all the people who just drool all over Paul, the apostle was, no, what an

1448
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:57,580
intellect, what a great guy.

1449
01:14:57,980 --> 01:14:59,140
He's doing his thing.

1450
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:04,660
He's so drugged that he gets bitten by an ass, but it doesn't hurt him.

1451
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:05,460
Doesn't hurt him at all.

1452
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:09,460
And he shakes it off like, eh, because he knows what that venom is like.

1453
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:09,740
Right.

1454
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:12,020
He knows it because he's been shoving it.

1455
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:18,260
If he's, I recently, I've recently come to the conclusion that that part of the

1456
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:24,220
text is trying to say something to the certain people who are initiated into

1457
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:29,060
these serpent, serpent sex of Christianity, the Nazis, the old fights.

1458
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,780
That that's like a, a nod to them.

1459
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:36,740
And that passage of acts where it's like Paul got bit by the serpent, nothing

1460
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:37,140
happened.

1461
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:41,380
And the people, those old fights are reading this text like, oh, shit.

1462
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:42,300
Yeah.

1463
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:43,540
Yeah.

1464
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:44,500
He's one of us.

1465
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:49,700
That's why Jesus says, I'm shocked that Jesus says, you know, you can expose

1466
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:52,260
yourself to this stuff and it's not going to hurt you.

1467
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:52,460
Right.

1468
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:56,420
He can show these things, right?

1469
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:57,900
And people are never understand.

1470
01:15:57,900 --> 01:15:59,460
They think fairy tale.

1471
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:03,780
They think, um, Charlton Heston playing Moses and Easter.

1472
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:04,620
Right.

1473
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:10,260
They don't, they don't think, uh, what's the reality going on, man?

1474
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:11,300
Paul was juiced.

1475
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:14,380
Paul was juiced and there was money involved.

1476
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:16,660
And there's a woman, a Lydian woman.

1477
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:20,140
I think her name is Lydia involved in the purple trade, right?

1478
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:24,900
That stuff keeps coming up and keeps coming up and keeps coming up.

1479
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:29,780
So these early Christians were not only gangsters, but they were into the drugs,

1480
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:30,100
man.

1481
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:31,580
I'm going to throw this one up.

1482
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:34,940
This is one of the last ones we have, but I got a real quick cause I drank so

1483
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:39,100
much tea that I got to take a piss or throw this up so you can read it.

1484
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,020
And I'll be right back.

1485
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:40,980
Okay.

1486
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:42,140
I will read it.

1487
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:46,940
And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth.

1488
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:51,980
Again, this is just like Dionysus does and gathered the vine of the earth and

1489
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:55,140
cast it in the great wine press of the wrath of God.

1490
01:16:55,580 --> 01:16:59,180
And for those of you who think that they were, um, the Jews were

1491
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:02,460
grapes, they weren't, it was a Canaanite industry.

1492
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:07,460
And the wine press was trodden without the city and blood came out of the wine

1493
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:13,740
press, even unto the horses bridles, but a space of 1,600 furlocked.

1494
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:18,900
Oh my God, this blood is the blood that he's bringing out of you and me.

1495
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:24,100
Bra, when he comes back, this is the blood that he's going to produce.

1496
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:28,780
He's going to put us in that press and he's going to squeeze out blood.

1497
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:36,540
That is not, that is not the savior that you and I see in church, right?

1498
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:42,260
If they had a giant painting of a dude that was forcing your head into a wine

1499
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:48,180
press and squeezing out your guts and blood and one giant mess that was as

1500
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:50,860
high as, that was as high as a horse's bridle.

1501
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:54,860
How high is a horse's bridle comes up, can come up to your chest, you know,

1502
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:57,660
if you ever stand next to a horse, right?

1503
01:17:58,020 --> 01:18:04,340
So, and it says in, in Apocalypse, it says there, his garments are stained with

1504
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:07,180
blood, stained with blood bra.

1505
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:14,420
That is a dude that you and I can get behind and say, this, this guy is going

1506
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:15,980
to take us all the way.

1507
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:18,020
This is what gang members look for.

1508
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:21,740
They look for that strong leader to take us all the way.

1509
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:24,620
You know, unfortunately, Peter, God is ending.

1510
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:27,060
They caught up with him, which they always do.

1511
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:32,900
Gang leaders always get screwed in the end because they inevitably run a

1512
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:35,660
foul because they're organized crime.

1513
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:38,900
They inevitably run a foul of the civic authorities.

1514
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:42,460
Jesus did it with the Romans, got himself crucified.

1515
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:46,020
Peter did it, got himself crucified, right?

1516
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:54,740
It's, it's almost like that hope of Roman civilization was to preserve that ethos,

1517
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:59,580
that, that understanding of that the law governs.

1518
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:04,140
And when you have a group that are organized crime, when you have a group

1519
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:12,580
that's functioning based on that black market, you can't, you can't look at

1520
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:16,140
Jesus's image when he's sitting there with Mary and she brings out this

1521
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:20,140
stuff that is so expensive, you could have given it to the poor and fed a

1522
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:21,100
whole bunch of people.

1523
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:22,460
Instead, she uses it on him.

1524
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:28,940
My question is, what is their gang doing with those resources, right?

1525
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:32,700
These are black market resources and they're using them.

1526
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:34,180
They're using them.

1527
01:19:34,180 --> 01:19:35,820
Jesus is in it deep.

1528
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:40,500
So when he's arrested with that kid in the public park at four in the morning,

1529
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:43,780
maybe it's not so strange.

1530
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:45,020
Is that part of the bling?

1531
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:46,380
Is that part of the thing?

1532
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:47,180
You're with that kid.

1533
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:49,420
You're in the right, getting hyped up.

1534
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:54,700
You're entering that mode and he thinks he, he's genuine thinking he's the

1535
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:56,340
son of God, right?

1536
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:58,700
He's very genuine in that, right?

1537
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:00,420
Yeah.

1538
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:04,220
So good for him for Dionysus and Thug life.

1539
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:04,820
I love it.

1540
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:05,180
Yeah.

1541
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:08,460
He's the, he's the cronion son, the son of Kronos.

1542
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:11,220
Like he's trying to, that's what he's going for.

1543
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:18,700
He's going, he's trying to set up a, a mystery right out of the culture that he's

1544
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:20,100
in, like, you know, that's what it's at.

1545
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:22,260
That's what it very much seems like.

1546
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:24,420
That was the last slide.

1547
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:27,220
But before I even get to, there's some questions people want to ask about the

1548
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:30,820
Greek, um, before I even ask that, I just want one more time.

I like helping people pass their college exams.

It feels really good.

01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:48,820
And then to inspire them to say, Oh man, maybe this field is actually interesting.

1576
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:50,020
Yeah.

1577
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:54,340
Professors out there do everything they can to kill interest in the field by

1578
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:56,180
doing the most boring stuff.

1579
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:57,700
But yeah.

1580
01:21:58,340 --> 01:21:58,900
Yeah.

1581
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:02,980
I'm going to, I've got to stick to my, I've got to stick to my oath to the devil.

You got to go.

I understand.

1585
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:06,100
I'm going to do that.

1586
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:07,300
I'm going to, I'm going to do that.

1587
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:10,340
I think Neil, it's an honor to have you on.

1588
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:13,540
It's been an extreme honor, uh, an extreme honor.

And for those of you who are out there, who are following Neil and following, you know,

1591
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:29,060
Yeah.

1592
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:30,020
For the better.

1593
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:31,620
I can't, I can't describe that.

1594
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:35,700
I like to say you, you learn somebody when you fight against them.

1595
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:39,620
And I learned honor through fighting with Neil.

1596
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:41,460
I want you guys to know that.

1597
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:45,620
And this man loves the muse and he's, he's honorable servant.

Thank you.

Thank you.

01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:52,820
And, uh, like I said, everybody go hit the subscribe and follow you over there.

1602
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:55,780
You'll see me on the channel every once in a while, popping up on there.

1603
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:58,020
And, uh, all right, take it easy.

1604
01:22:58,020 --> 01:22:59,540
I'll see you soon.

1605
01:22:59,540 --> 01:22:59,780
Okay.

1606
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:00,260
Talk to you.

1607
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:02,580
So yeah.

1608
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:08,260
So, you know, he had to go and I apologize if you, uh, sent a super chat towards him.

1609
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:13,060
I'll do my best to, uh, accommodate whatever I can stop scamming, man.

1610
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:14,500
Thank you for the super chat.

1611
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:17,380
Can you provide any insight into the meaning of the Greek word and the New

1612
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:22,340
Testament, which translates English to demon also do any, it's a good question.

1613
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:30,500
Cause you got the word daemon, which kind of just translates to God, but in the Christian

1614
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:38,340
sense, it kind of becomes demon where it's like a bad God or like some sort of demonic spirit.

1615
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:44,180
That's as best as I could do on answering that question, but, uh, I apologize that I'm

1616
01:23:44,180 --> 01:23:49,860
won't have to leave, but, uh, I really, you know, you know, some of the, I get people on,

1617
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:51,780
they only have a certain amount of time to be here.

1618
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:52,980
So I apologize for that.

1619
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:54,660
Morrison prophecy.

1620
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:55,540
Thank you for the super chat.

1621
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:56,980
I finally caught one of these lives.

1622
01:23:56,980 --> 01:23:57,780
I love your channel.

1623
01:23:57,780 --> 01:24:01,060
I was raised evangelical and agree with everything you said this morning.

1624
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:02,100
Cheers.

1625
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:03,620
Awesome.

1626
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:04,740
It's good to see you, Morrison.

1627
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:06,020
Thank you for that.

1628
01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:08,020
Stop scamming, man.

1629
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:08,500
Hello again.

1630
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:13,460
Can you provide any insights on the Greek words for heaven and paradise the New Testament

1631
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:16,500
uses and do not, and any question, right?

1632
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:17,780
Our nose is heaven.

1633
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:19,860
Paradise.

1634
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:25,300
That's an, um, let me see what, uh, Perseus stuffs has for paradise.

1635
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:27,620
Paradise.

1636
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:28,260
I don't even know.

1637
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:29,460
Paradise.

1638
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:32,500
Paradise in Greek.

1639
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:36,340
Paradisos.

1640
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:37,220
Paradisos.

1641
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:41,300
So, uh, let me see if I can share my screen.

1642
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:44,100
Yeah.

1643
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:45,860
So you have our nose, which is heaven.

1644
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:48,100
It's the same one for the God, our nose.

1645
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:50,500
And then Paradisos.

1646
01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:57,860
Parad, Paradiso, Paradiso, Paradiso, Paradiso.

1647
01:24:58,980 --> 01:24:59,380
Yeah.

1648
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:00,500
That's the best I could do.

1649
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:01,220
Sorry about that.

1650
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:02,740
Thank you for the super chat.

1651
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:03,380
I appreciate that.

1652
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:07,540
I wish I could, uh, you know, I wish I was an expert in Greek and can help you out with that.

1653
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:10,340
Thank you for that though.

1654
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:18,740
Cthonious, my boy, Cthonious, who was Jesus's father?

1655
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:21,620
God, to me, it's the Old Testament.

1656
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:23,460
God, the Jews rejected him.

1657
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:25,220
Did his God have a secret name?

1658
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:25,540
Yeah.

1659
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:26,260
I think you're right.

1660
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:33,140
He claimed to be the son of, yeah, Yahweh, you know, he can, he claimed to be the son of

1661
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:39,940
the Old Testament, the biblical God, you know, so that's a definite,

1662
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:41,700
that's definitely, that's definitely the thing.

1663
01:25:43,860 --> 01:25:46,020
Thank you, Justina Carrion for the super sticker.

1664
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:49,940
