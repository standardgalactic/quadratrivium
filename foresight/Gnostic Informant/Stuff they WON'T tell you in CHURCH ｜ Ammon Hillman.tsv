0	7720	Welcome back to the Gnostic Informant and you are about to attain true gnosis and today
7720	10040	we're going to go deep again.
10040	13840	As you know, I have Dr. Amon with me.
13840	20800	And if you haven't yet subscribed, go to Lady Babylon, hit that subscribe button.
20800	28040	This is, this is one, there's only one place in the world where you're going to find content
28040	29040	like this.
29040	30840	And I'm not joking.
30840	39680	This is a perfect, this is a real classical philologist who is trained in the ancient
39680	46840	classical Greek languages, who also studies the, the, the drugs.
46840	47840	What do I mean by that?
47840	50280	Well, I'll just pull, I'll just give you an example.
50280	53160	He wrote, kind of a commuse.
53160	55600	This is a big hit.
55600	61240	As you can see, you know, the times UK said, this is the last wild frontier of classical
61240	62240	studies.
62240	66000	And you can get it right here on Amazon, links in the description.
66000	68120	The ancient world is not what you think.
68120	73200	I mean, just imagine if we had the like, I don't know, Lord of the Rings, but it was
73200	76600	rated R and there's prostitutes and drugs everywhere.
76600	85640	That's the ancient world that we don't, that we lost through a thousand years of the church.
85640	90520	But the ancient world before the church was a different place and we lose a lot of the
90520	91960	context of that.
91960	95120	When this, and that's what Dr. Amon brings to the table.
95120	99520	He reminds, he's reminding the world of what the ancients were doing.
99520	104760	And he brings a lot of context that is needed in my opinion when I'm looking into stuff
104760	105760	that I do.
105920	108120	Also, he offers his services.
108120	113520	And as you can see, he's a PhD in classics, he's got five stars, perfect rating out of
113520	116360	378 ratings.
116360	121400	You can hit the link in the description if you want to learn classical Greek or Latin.
121400	123600	He does both.
123600	127960	Let's just go down real quick just to see some of these reviews.
127960	129800	Learning is easy to Professor David.
129800	131960	He makes it fun and interesting.
131960	133800	Learning is quick and very smooth.
133800	135080	That was me, by the way.
135120	137840	Four lessons I've done so far.
137840	139840	Knowledgeable is an understatement.
139840	144320	Amon is able to take me through ancient Greek in a way that other teacher could.
144320	147840	I am comfortable learning with Amon and look forward to continuing.
147840	155480	There is countless, countless people who have left five stars and who are continuing to
155480	159320	get learning languages from Dr. Amon.
159320	164360	So with that being said, make sure you hit those subscribes, check out those links.
164360	169920	And we are going to have an amazing, amazing show tonight.
169920	174120	We're going to go deep into the stuff that they do not tell you in church.
174120	178160	Let me repeat that.
178160	181800	You will not hear this in church.
181800	182400	Hit the intro.
224360	251200	All right, here's without further ado, Dr. Amon, what is going on?
251200	254560	Neil, the great informant of the gnosis.
254560	258160	Yes, it's good to see you and thank you for having me on.
258160	263240	It's always, I'm always jumping at the chance to come on and address your audience.
263240	265320	So thank you for having me.
265320	266320	Absolutely.
266320	271160	I can't wait to get into this topic because as you guys know in the thumbnail, gangster
271160	275680	Jesus, some of you might be like, come on, that's a cheap shot.
275680	280000	But wait, this is, there's something to this thing.
280000	282040	He is a boaster.
282040	284040	He is not playing around.
284040	288520	The Jesus you get in church is, you know, love your neighbor as you love yourself.
288520	291360	And the greatest thing you can do is love.
291360	299920	But that's, that's part of his schizophrenic, if you will, message that flips on a dime and
299920	306040	he'll just randomly snap and then brag about going after Jezebel and throwing her on a
306040	312400	table to rape her and then killing your children and then saying, I am the morning star, bitch.
312400	314520	And like, we're going to get into these texts right now.
314520	316240	You're probably running, what, what are you talking about?
316240	317880	What text is this?
317880	319760	And that's what we're about to bring you right now.
319760	322360	So let's get into it.
322360	324880	This is the Bible thug life, man.
324880	327280	This is the thug life of the Bible.
327280	333920	When I started dipping into the drugs and antiquity and the prostitution and these cult rights
333920	334920	and stuff.
334920	337280	Yeah, you see a lot of thuggery.
337280	338280	Yeah.
338280	339960	So this is a great topic.
339960	341760	Let's bring it all out.
341760	342760	All out.
342760	343760	Good.
343760	344760	Absolutely.
344760	345760	Good.
345760	350320	I want to, can I throw up first and I more want to present this to you and then you have,
350320	354280	you give me meal, your thing, because people like this love between us.
354280	355280	Yeah.
355280	357280	I'm going to pump up your energy.
357280	359720	We're going to bounce you back and forth.
359720	360720	All right.
360720	361720	Let's go.
362720	365840	That first email, the Peter kills Ananias, right?
365840	366840	Yeah.
366840	367840	Right.
367840	376280	So there was a certain guy named Ananias and his wife was Sapphira, right?
376280	381320	Anyway, he sold some land, some of his own goods he sold, right?
381320	385400	This is usually like a building upon a piece of land or something.
385400	391600	He's got some cash there going and he, like everybody else, he sells it, right?
392000	393640	And he only gave a part.
393640	397560	He only gave a part of it to Peter, right?
397560	403800	And so Peter says, Hey, what are you filled with Satan, you know, that you got this thing
403800	408640	in your heart, that you're lying to the spirit of God, that you, you kept some of this stuff
408640	410520	back, bro.
410520	411760	And yeah.
411760	417200	And that's where it gets weird because he falls down right away.
417200	419400	He falls down and dies.
419400	420400	Wow.
420440	421440	Yeah.
421440	426560	You're in this X Epsuchsen, X Epsuchsen.
426560	435240	And it uses a weird word there, uses a very weird word there, neo for to die.
435240	442720	It's used by the doctors on the side of the medical tax for losing a heart rate, a stable
442720	447840	heart rate, because they were all, they were all into the pulse and whatnot.
447840	453440	And so it has to do with some kind of cardiac event, right?
453440	454600	And so there he is.
454600	455600	That makes sense.
455600	457640	Why he hits the ground, right?
457640	458800	As dead.
458800	464600	And the text says that this, this message went out, man.
464600	466600	People stood in fear.
466600	469400	People were afraid because of this.
469400	470400	Yeah.
470400	471800	And then he brings in his wife.
471800	473920	Same thing happens to his wife.
473920	476000	She hits the ground.
476000	477000	And he tells her.
477000	478080	It's so good.
478080	479080	He can tell her.
479080	482400	He says, we just took your husband out and buried him just like we're going to bury
482400	483400	you.
483400	484960	And boom, she hits the ground.
484960	489800	Now what's funny that people don't point out is there are some neoniscoy, right?
489800	492600	There's some neoteroi there.
492600	495840	These are the new initiates.
495840	499040	These are the people who've just started into the cult, right?
499040	504880	Who were just in the family, calling people brother and they sit there and they do what
504880	507040	Peter tells them to do.
507040	513680	So somehow Peter had this interaction and in both cases, in both cases, he was able to
513680	517880	get them to die on cue, right?
517880	527920	When you sin against that pluma, that is a sin that is performed within the right.
527920	533440	That's the only thing that can't be pardoned is a sin within the right.
533440	539560	And if you took that poison without taking the antidote, you were dead.
539560	544280	And if Peter didn't give it to you, that's it.
544280	545280	Yeah.
545280	551600	And I want to throw something out here too because this is coming from the chapter where
551600	559800	these new initiates, they sold their property and they gave away most of the funds to the
559800	565400	church or the assembly and kept a little bit for themselves.
565400	566480	And that was enough.
566480	567980	That was not cool.
567980	569760	They were not playing around.
569760	573200	You're supposed to give all of it, you're not supposed to keep any of it for yourself.
573200	574200	That is it.
574200	581440	Where's all these conservative Republican Christians at today that are owning businesses
581440	586080	and you think they would ever, that's not the way, like what happened to that?
586080	588680	The idea that you can't have any private property.
588680	589680	That's gone now.
589680	590880	That's not the Christians today.
590880	593960	This is a whole different world back then.
593960	594960	Yeah.
594960	603040	According to our modern evangelical fairytale, it's our blessing by God who has given us
603040	609240	manifest destiny to be able to make as much capital as we possibly can.
609240	615880	But in antiquity, those Christians were instructed, you have to get rid of everything.
615880	620040	And what they said was you got to lay it at the feet of the rock.
620040	624080	You got to lay everything at the feet of the rock.
624080	625080	And so that's what they did.
625080	630240	And then it says they redistributed out what they needed for food and whatnot like that.
630240	631240	So yeah.
631240	632240	Right.
632240	633240	Remember, these people are dropping out though.
633240	635440	They're dropping out of society, right?
635440	636440	They're disappearing.
636440	638200	They're leaving families.
638200	639200	They're doing all this.
639200	641720	So we got kind of a radical group.
641720	650960	And when we see gangster Peter, right, making these hits and setting the stage for the
650960	660080	rock, Petros, yeah, that's his gang name, you know, he's got some friends.
660080	663520	They call them the sons of thunder.
663520	666000	Don't mess with these people.
666000	668240	We know that they're armed.
668240	675000	Where Peter's the one who jumps out and starts swinging the sword, right, cuts his ear off.
675000	676000	Yeah.
676000	678240	He's not supposed to be carrying a sword, by the way.
678240	679240	That's a no-no.
679240	680240	Right.
680240	686000	And there's no, you know, Ray in antiquity, they have laws against things, right?
686000	688480	So yeah, he's armed and he's there.
688480	692440	And he's there with the trafficking Jesus, with the boy and the naked boy.
692440	696600	But let's go to the, let's go to the next one.
696600	697600	Yeah.
697720	699280	All curses, right?
699280	700960	There won't be any curses anymore.
700960	702760	This is from Apocalypse.
702760	703760	Yeah.
703760	708600	And the throne of God, the lamb was in them, right, will be in them.
708600	712720	And the slaves, right, they'll serve them, right?
712720	720880	And they will look upon his face and they're, they're, they're foreheads, metopon, right
720880	722040	on their foreheads.
722040	727480	They're going to have to on them out to, they're going to have his name.
727480	740920	This thug leader has slaves and those slaves bear a brand as do any slaves, right?
740920	745120	This is, you know, we're not living in a slave culture, so this doesn't strike us.
745120	750040	But these are, that word Latreo is that word of service.
750040	756360	Jesus has slaves whom he imprints with his own name on their heads, right?
756360	760240	Now remember, we looked at Jesus as the laystace.
760240	764000	He calls himself, when he gets arrested, he comes out yelling, he's like, would you come
764000	768040	out against me armed like I'm a pirate, right?
768040	773520	This is the accoutrement of the pirate, right?
773520	777680	This is, he's got a brand that he carries, right?
777680	782800	And he brands you, you're his, right, and he's going to trade you off.
782800	784160	That brand will follow you.
784160	786560	You'll always be in service, bro.
786560	789240	So this is a part of the machinery of antiquity.
789240	793320	People don't realize it's baked into the language, you know what I mean?
793320	794720	Oh, that's crazy.
794720	797200	That is wild, actually.
797200	805160	That is just absolutely, I mean, he's, this is like, you're, you're getting branded.
805160	809680	You're getting, basically getting tatted basically for your gang.
809680	814000	And now you better die, you better be a martyr for this gang.
814000	815000	It's, it's radical.
815000	819280	This is not like some club that everybody was holding hands and doing hymns like your,
819280	820720	like your Sunday church.
820720	824760	This is like, you're going to get a brand on you and then you better go and die for
824760	825760	this faith.
825760	826760	Because if you don't, you're not real.
826760	827760	Yeah.
827760	833520	You better be a, this is like the real, I don't know, I was going to say the word jihadi,
833520	839040	but like, kind of, did you notice, did you notice the apocalypse?
839040	843800	He's constantly threatening, I'll, I'll wipe your name out of the book of life.
843800	847440	If you do this, I'll wipe your name out of the book of life.
847440	848440	They're not playing around.
848440	849760	This is not a light at all.
849760	850760	This is serious.
850760	851760	Yeah.
851760	852760	Yeah.
852760	854120	And why is he coming back?
854120	859600	People are like, Jesus, come back and resurrect me and the evangelicals are like, Oh, I'm a
859600	863840	dominionist, pre tribulations, right?
863840	867920	Just BS that has no, that has no meaning to it.
868280	873360	From the 1600s that they just made up, it's not, it's not biblical.
873360	879000	Like, like, like Bart Ehrman pointed out in one of Derek's videos that Jesus is coming
879000	880000	back.
880000	884320	He's going to look for people when he says Jezebel, he's talking about people, a specific
884320	890680	type of people who are profaners of the mysteries, people who are part, he's going to take them,
890680	896160	throw her out of bed, rape her, go look for her children and kill them.
896200	898200	Well, that's, that's, that's the return of Jesus.
898200	899200	There's no rapture.
899200	901880	There's no come to take my people who believe me.
901880	904120	No, it's come to kill the people who don't believe me.
904120	906080	It's the, it's the negative.
906080	908080	It's the opposite of that.
908080	910200	That's a thug hit right there, baby.
910200	911200	Kill that.
911200	913480	Not only that, kill that, kill that BI.
913480	914480	You know what?
914480	918680	And her children to knock them all off, knock them all off.
918680	919680	It's a hit.
919680	925720	But that's, that's, that's, that's your, that's your basic messiah, messianic, all messiahs
925760	930280	doesn't matter what sect or religion, that's the, the idea of the messiah.
930280	932200	That's what the messiah is supposed to do.
932200	933200	Yeah.
933200	936280	That's not, that's not nothing new that Christianity is bringing to the table.
936280	937480	That's just, that's the messiah.
937480	938840	That's the real messiah.
938840	942640	There is nothing new that Christianity brought to the table.
942640	943640	Yeah.
943640	946040	There is nothing new, right?
946040	951600	If you took a pin and marked out like you were redacting something for a lawyer or something.
951600	957000	If you went, took a pin, black pin and marked out everything that had precedent, the whole
957000	961120	thing would be dark, you know, except for Jesus went down to Bethany.
961120	964360	That's the only thing that, you know, just be his directions.
964360	965360	Right.
965360	966360	Right.
966360	967360	Yeah.
967360	968360	Love it.
968360	969360	Love it.
969360	972600	It's everything is, but you can't, you and I can't do anything original, right?
972600	977400	You don't, you see anybody else coming up with a religion that's new thing like that?
977400	978400	No.
978400	983280	You see with language, when you talk, when you're using a certain language, you cannot
983280	988800	come out of, you can't separate yourself from the linguistics that you're operating within.
988800	992720	No, it's like an amber and it traps you.
992720	997760	That language traps the meaning for, forever preserves it.
997760	998760	Yeah.
998760	999760	He's going to come back.
999760	1003760	He's not, people think he's coming back and it's all going to be half resurrection and
1003760	1004760	I'm going to heaven.
1004760	1005760	You all can.
1005760	1006760	No, no, no.
1006760	1010480	He's going to come back to kill all of us.
1010480	1013520	The mission is to kill everyone.
1013520	1015160	Think about this.
1015160	1018520	Think about, let's look at some more sources.
1018520	1019680	What's that next one?
1019680	1020680	Yeah.
1020680	1021680	Don't do that.
1021680	1025960	Oh, I just wanted to bring this up because this is a quote, you know, revelation 22.
1025960	1028000	I am a fellow servant with you.
1028000	1029000	Right.
1029000	1032480	That word servant is the same word for slave, right?
1032480	1033480	Right.
1033480	1034480	Yeah.
1034480	1035480	No, no, no.
1035600	1037280	He's talking about bowing.
1037280	1040760	This is an angel responding to John who's bowing in front of him.
1040760	1041920	He says, don't do that.
1041920	1047280	He's like, you know, I'm a, I'm a, I'm also a slave, right?
1047280	1049200	And then he says worship God.
1049200	1054200	The only one that you're that slave to is the living God.
1054200	1056120	We are do Lloyd.
1056120	1058320	We are slaves, brah.
1058320	1059320	Yeah.
1059320	1060320	Okay.
1060320	1061320	Next one that.
1061320	1063320	Oh, look at this one.
1063320	1064320	Oh.
1065160	1072000	And by the way, isn't that, isn't there, isn't, isn't he basically calling him like the equivalent
1072000	1074000	of the B word, right?
1074000	1078320	Uh, he's, well, uh, that's an interesting question.
1078320	1079560	That's an interesting question.
1079560	1090880	I don't, uh, it's so cult tied up this word, that you even have dogs who are official priests.
1090880	1095000	So the, because the next one is father McCoy, right?
1095000	1097360	Those are people who are specific.
1097360	1098760	That's a technical term.
1098760	1099760	Yeah.
1099760	1107680	Those are people within the cult or within the community who are experts in drugs, right?
1107680	1110160	And, and so all of these are the pornoi.
1110160	1112520	Who do you think the pornoi are?
1112520	1116160	Those are the people that's the lady Babylon way, right?
1116160	1120840	And, and why do you think they're called phonase?
1120840	1126280	They're called murderers because they're performing their sacrifice.
1126280	1133200	And the last one, the a dola la trii, those who were in service of the image, the image
1133200	1135520	of the image, right?
1135520	1140920	These, these people are the people on the outside that, and what's going to happen to
1140920	1141920	them, right?
1141920	1143960	Let's see what the next one is.
1143960	1144960	Yeah.
1144960	1145960	Yeah.
1145960	1146960	Yeah.
1146960	1149240	And she'll take away the words of the book of the prophets.
1149240	1155560	God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from
1155560	1158080	the things which are written in this book.
1158080	1159080	Yeah.
1159080	1161200	This is intense, man.
1161200	1164320	This is not the love your neighbor type of Jesus right here.
1164320	1168360	This is, he's going to wipe you off the face of the planet like you never existed, throw
1168360	1170640	you in the lake of fire.
1170640	1171800	That's what this is.
1171800	1173680	And when you say wipe off, you're right.
1173680	1177480	That's exactly off the LA is exactly that, right?
1177480	1181880	He's going to take out your portion, right from the tree of life.
1181880	1185880	You're not going to have any sort of access to this, right?
1185880	1186880	That's it, bro.
1186880	1188560	I'm going to kill you dead.
1188560	1190000	Is this a threat, Neil?
1190000	1194560	When you said gangster Jesus, and I was like, this is perfect.
1194560	1200560	This was Neil's idea by the way, I said, this is perfect gangster all over the place.
1200560	1201560	This is an example.
1201560	1207200	He's got a book and if you're not in it, right, you don't get anywhere.
1207200	1209800	You don't get anywhere without me in my book.
1209800	1211120	That's a gangster, bro.
1211120	1212120	Yeah.
1212120	1213120	It's gorgeous.
1213120	1214120	Yeah.
1214120	1215120	Yeah.
1215120	1220920	And it's like, there's no, this isn't about like doing anything or feeding the poor or
1220920	1221920	doing.
1221920	1224920	It's just about getting in line and do what I say.
1224920	1230640	That's the only thing that makes you or breaks you in the eyes of this God.
1230640	1232600	Do get in line, period.
1232600	1235440	I don't care what's, there's no objective morality.
1235440	1239680	Like you hear these Christians talk about today and no, no, no, no, no, no, it's get
1239680	1244080	in line, do as you're told or die.
1244080	1251000	It's when you think about it, it's really simple and it's kind of it's really dark because
1251000	1256120	that's what this whole faith is kind of based on is just following it.
1256120	1257120	You know what I mean?
1257120	1263400	It's not like, like, I hate to say like paganism is like this like huge umbrella term, but
1263400	1267240	like these other rights, then they don't operate that way.
1267240	1270560	There is no like, you better do this or else.
1270560	1275560	It's only within this biblical religion that you get that.
1275560	1284840	And it's so opposite of classical civilization, the drive towards investigation and study
1284840	1291560	and argumentation, you know, it's so contrary to that.
1291560	1295800	There isn't, there is an implied reason in pagan religion.
1295800	1299840	It's like when somebody tells you, don't believe what you're seeing, right?
1299840	1304640	Don't, don't, it's just bad press that's giving you this impression.
1304640	1306200	That's what Christianity does.
1306200	1308240	It says, don't use your reason.
1308240	1314760	Well, you know, you don't, I noticed about that too, multi polytheism, right?
1314760	1320640	Multiple gods, you give your devote devotion to the God that you align with, the God that
1320640	1323840	you look at, that you look up to, that you need help from.
1323840	1331360	But in monotheism, it's sort of, monotheism sort of aligns the world in a way that makes
1331360	1336360	it so that you have one king or one Caesar or one emperor.
1336360	1341760	And underneath that one emperor is the footstool, the world, the Roman empire, and everyone
1341760	1344400	is a servant to this one emperor.
1344400	1349680	That's why all of a sudden when you get this Christian Byzantine empire, it's, it's really
1349720	1354920	just like, all of it's privately owned by the Caesar, by, by the emperor, by the Constantine
1354920	1359160	or whoever, like, you know, all these different Constantine the six and Constantine the seventh
1359160	1366480	and, and just keeps going until another, and like, you can come get it from me, come get
1366480	1367480	it from me.
1367480	1372520	Like if you can assert this throne, you can have this world, but until then it's mine.
1372520	1377440	And these legions are mine, they're going to do what I say, and my will is be done.
1377440	1384440	And it, it follows the monotheistic religion that it's operating within.
1385560	1393360	So the religion sort of sets the tone of how the society operates, whatever theocracy,
1393360	1398720	like in the, and like, I, you know, I sound like I'm people, people will always say, but
1398720	1401160	you act like the pagan world is so perfect.
1401160	1405880	There were still problems, of course there was, but like, at least within this world
1405920	1410520	where you have all these different deities and different temples and, you know, the
1410520	1415800	temple of Ephesus was Artemis, the temple of Athena, the Acropolis, at least in this
1415800	1422360	world, it seems to be, there's, there was more, like you said, there's more debates,
1422360	1428360	more discussion, more, more diverse, like more, more metropolitan-y feeling going on.
1429360	1430640	You know, what is your thoughts on that?
1430640	1431640	And I could be wrong.
1431960	1436520	I think what you're describing is not the gang, right?
1436520	1440200	The gang, we have to have a certain code and we have to have a certain color and we have
1440200	1447200	to have a certain ethnicity and we take orders up and we don't question, we just kill, right?
1447200	1449040	That's the gang mentality.
1449040	1453320	And I think Christianity is very much, that's because when you, when you said it, gangster
1453320	1456520	Jesus, I thought, wow, Neil, you've captured it.
1456520	1457360	It is.
1457400	1462520	When you have paganism, on the other hand, there is no overriding authority.
1462880	1467240	There's no one central person who can tell you what's what.
1467720	1467880	Yeah.
1467880	1468800	I mean, think about it.
1468880	1471640	Paganism expressed itself in the chorus.
1472080	1476280	A chorus is a group of people who come together and sing and dance.
1476880	1480800	I mean, what is more, you know, what is more democratic than that?
1480800	1481760	The Christians did not.
1482040	1486280	And even Zeus, even Zeus doesn't have all the power.
1486520	1492720	Like Zeus might, might get, Eros might have power over Zeus or Athena might have power.
1492720	1496640	There's, there's different situations where sometimes Zeus doesn't have the
1496640	1498520	authority just to do whatever he wants.
1498840	1499040	Yeah.
1499080	1500960	So there is that, there's that.
1501560	1509840	I feel like that, that aspect kind of dictates the culture in a, in a really
1509840	1515040	effective way when you have that one authority on top, everyone follows suit.
1515440	1517960	Better do what that one authority says or else.
1518920	1519160	Yeah.
1519680	1523920	And it's funny because when the, when the Ottomans come and take
1523920	1527920	Constance and Opal, Mehmed II, what does he do?
1528200	1529400	He says, I'm Caesar now.
1529920	1531960	He just wants, he wants to continue playing the same game.
1532160	1533440	He's not changing anything up.
1533840	1537280	He just, we're Muslim now, but, but I'm going to be Caesar.
1537520	1540000	Even, even ask the Pope, call me Caesar.
1540040	1541320	Pope, the Pope's like, no, bro.
1541760	1545800	But like, well, you still, he's, they're, they're playing the same game.
1546200	1546480	Yeah.
1547040	1550200	And it's kind of, it's kind of crazy to think about the world.
1550200	1552640	Like that's how the world was for a long time.
1553160	1557040	What's the difference between a crusade and a gang war?
1557360	1562400	You know, it's always over, it's always over capital of some support, some, you
1562400	1569920	know, uh, some kind of rights to be able to run this black market in this area.
1570320	1571000	You know what I mean?
1571000	1574840	It's always just like, look at the, look at the history of the crusades.
1574880	1576440	It's the same thing.
1576760	1577680	It's the flow.
1577680	1579080	There is no ideal.
1579080	1583880	People that think crusaders were ideal, idealistic, um, you know,
1583880	1585640	I'm going to go fight for Jesus.
1585640	1589640	And there are people who have that soldier of Christ mentality today.
1589920	1590800	Let me tell you something.
1590800	1592680	There's no such thing as a crusade.
1592680	1596880	Crusades are just wars over turf and cash.
1596960	1597200	Right.
1597560	1598960	That's, that's all they are.
1599480	1604160	So I don't, I don't, I don't understand why, um, people can't see the
1604160	1606880	thuggery that's behind Christianity.
1606960	1610240	That's why Neil, I'm still really impressed that you made.
1610440	1613960	Well, the, the Godfather, what do you think a Pope is?
1614760	1616240	He's the, he's the Godfather.
1617440	1621200	This is, I mean, it's like literally the same thing.
1621760	1622040	Yeah.
1622240	1623320	You know, what's the difference?
1623480	1625240	You know, it's my ring, man.
1625400	1625720	Yeah.
1626240	1626760	On your knee.
1628520	1629280	Do what you told.
1629880	1630600	Lovely.
1630840	1632120	Let's go to the next source.
1632120	1633880	Let me see if I got any more cool gang.
1634200	1634480	All right.
1634480	1636360	So we have angels or slaves.
1636360	1636800	We got that.
1636800	1637560	We did that one, right?
1638120	1638480	Yeah.
1639160	1639480	Good.
1640120	1640560	Here we go.
1641120	1641640	Yeah.
1641760	1642240	Yeah.
1643240	1644080	That's the next one.
1644080	1644920	Let's go to the next one.
1644920	1645160	Yeah.
1646880	1647440	Yeah.
1647480	1647960	Yeah.
1648000	1648320	Okay.
1648320	1648720	Yeah.
1648760	1649120	Okay.
1649120	1652400	So for all of these people, look, it gives off a list, right?
1652400	1656040	Of people and notice right at the top, it's apistos.
1656320	1661280	These are people who don't subscribe to your notion of faith, right?
1661320	1664760	These are the people who don't just subscribe to your notion of faith.
1664800	1666400	So that's anybody.
1666920	1671000	We're not just talking about people think this is a list of bad things to do,
1671000	1672640	like murder, right?
1672640	1674840	Murder and, and lying.
1674840	1676160	These are bad things.
1676160	1678000	So Jesus is the good guy.
1678000	1678880	He doesn't follow it.
1678920	1679520	No, no, no.
1679920	1686120	He's saying anybody that doesn't follow us is abominable.
1686600	1687160	Yeah.
1687160	1688880	They're murderers, right?
1689040	1691680	They're, they're pharmacists.
1691720	1693480	Look, they're drug experts.
1693520	1695360	They're drug users.
1695960	1698320	They are wizard sorcerers.
1698720	1701600	He's calling everybody that, right?
1701600	1703400	And saying they're idolaters.
1703400	1706440	They're those image casters, right?
1706440	1710640	And by the way, he says the liars got no part.
1711480	1711800	Yeah.
1711800	1713480	The liars got no part.
1714200	1714880	Yeah.
1715520	1715720	Yeah.
1715720	1717120	They're going to be put in a lake.
1717240	1721440	Think of that imagery, though, a lake, which you burn it with fire and brimstone.
1721680	1722200	Yeah.
1723200	1726200	Now that sounds like that sounds like the pit of Tartarus, doesn't it?
1726880	1727320	Yeah.
1727320	1729440	No, this is the purging, right?
1729440	1734280	That Phaeoi, that, that brimstone that you're talking about.
1734800	1738240	Yeah, that's a powerful purgative.
1738720	1739240	Yeah.
1739240	1740760	And they're going to burn with it.
1740760	1744160	They're going to be purified in hell, right?
1744200	1746000	And that's the second death.
1746000	1747560	That's what you call the second death.
1747840	1750200	This is what Jesus brings.
1751000	1757480	This promise that if he comes back and you're not one of the faithful, right?
1757560	1759120	This is what you get.
1759120	1764240	So right away you got, um, look, there's no loving.
1764240	1767000	Here, where'd the loving go, right?
1767000	1772120	And evangelicals have such a good way of pulling that, of excusing this, right?
1772120	1773560	Of pulling this out of the hat.
1774040	1777240	They say, Oh, well, just the age of grace is over.
1777240	1781160	I'm a dominionist and the age of grace is over.
1781640	1785280	And, and that's why all of a sudden, no, no, no, let's just tell me what you've got.
1785280	1791880	You've got a picture of Jesus slaughtering all of humanity, all of humanity.
1792160	1793440	You know, I thought about this.
1794600	1795480	I thought about this.
1795480	1800800	And then even if Christian turned out to be true, which it's not, but let's just,
1800800	1802000	let's play along with this.
1802000	1808480	Even if this, this scenario actually comes about, I'm going, I'm saying sending
1808480	1809360	in that lake of fire.
1809360	1814200	I don't, this, this unit, this, this reality that you created, you're evil.
1814240	1818560	I'm not going to spend eternity at your feet worshiping you for this.
1818720	1819080	Yeah.
1819200	1820000	Kill me now.
1820080	1821080	And I'm done.
1821080	1826560	I, I'm out of this game because this is just, and it's like, you created me this
1826560	1826840	way.
1826840	1828600	So I don't know what your deal is.
1828640	1831520	You're the one that needs, this is, this is a you problem.
1831560	1832160	Get rid of me.
1832160	1832600	I'm done.
1832600	1833080	I don't care.
1833080	1837240	I'm like, that's to me is just evil.
1838160	1842320	I'm hoping, I'm hoping Neil that it's real as it can be.
1842600	1844760	So I can stand right in front of them.
1845560	1850800	And when it comes my moment of judgment, creamer, and they talk about the great
1850800	1855440	white throne and his judgment, I'm looking forward to standing right there.
1855440	1861480	I feel the same way for the great white throne and saying, you were arrested
1861480	1863320	with a naked boy.
1864000	1865200	I'm not following.
1867720	1869600	I wish I was behind you to watch it too.
1870600	1871640	I hope I don't go in front of you.
1871640	1873120	So I don't get to, I don't miss it.
1873640	1874080	Yeah.
1874440	1874920	Yeah.
1875200	1877280	Let's see what else is going to happen to us.
1877320	1878600	Because the next quote.
1878840	1880360	Fire from Urino's.
1880640	1881240	Yeah.
1881920	1885440	And she'll go out to see the nations, which are in the, oh, in the four quarters
1885440	1888960	of the earth, Gog and Magog to gather them together to battle.
1889240	1891160	The number of whom is as the same as the sea.
1891160	1895440	And they went up on the breadth of the earth and compass the camp of the saints
1895440	1896880	about these are the bad guys, right?
1896880	1898000	That's, that's us.
1898320	1901760	It's everybody who's not faithful and the beloved city.
1902280	1906520	And they came from and fire from came down from God out of heaven.
1906520	1911440	This is that poor Urino's and notice it's got the Gog and Magog reference in
1911440	1915280	it, which all the evangelicals are going to be standing up saying, oh my God,
1915280	1918520	he's talking about Gog and Magog, right?
1918840	1922320	Gog, if you go back to Ezekiel, which I've gotten the bottom.
1925200	1927160	And you're going to say, wait a minute, you're not reading the Hebrew.
1927480	1928120	Yeah, you're right.
1928120	1930120	I'm reading the oldest version we have.
1937120	1941720	And you, son of man, son of man.
1942000	1944160	Now you know where he stole the title from, right?
1944200	1944640	Right.
1944640	1945320	That's from Ezekiel.
1945360	1945640	Yep.
1945760	1946080	Yeah.
1946400	1952320	Prophecy against Gog and say the Lord says these things.
1952440	1953440	He do look.
1953720	1955600	I am Episay.
1955640	1957360	I am against you.
1957400	1962440	Gog, the ruler of Ross, Ross.
1962720	1964200	And what is Ross?
1964280	1968960	Ross is later, uh, Ruth's on the Latin side.
1969200	1975040	These are the people who live, um, where we now talk about Russians.
1975520	1976000	Oh, yeah.
1976000	1982160	So, so when the Christian evangelicals get all, especially the, the dominionists
1982440	1985280	and those guys, and it's mostly guys because they hate women.
1985280	1986200	They're misogynists.
1986600	1992360	Um, it's built in, it's built into the DNA of the gang of Christianity.
1992800	1994680	Um, and they just happen to bring it out.
1994680	1998360	Those guys just happened to bring this before Doug Wilson is in that group.
1998920	2004680	Anyway, anyway, um, they bring out this, uh, uh, hatred.
2004720	2009960	It's a, it's a living hatred, but they say also, Oh, this, the Russians, right?
2009960	2013120	You notice the Christians are all excited about the Russians and they're like,
2013120	2014440	Hey, don't help Ukraine.
2015040	2015280	Right.
2015280	2021680	You know, I know, I know Christians on Twitter, Catholics and Baptist, both of them.
2022080	2025080	And they, and those people hate each other, but they, they're coming together
2025080	2030200	and backing up Russia because Putin, cause they all, they all understand something.
2030680	2033080	They all understand something that's really real.
2033800	2038480	That the Orthodox church of Russia has a better claim to the, to the, to the
2038480	2041880	Greek Orthodox church than, than the Catholic church does.
2042160	2046920	They have a better claim to Peter and Paul than, than Rome does right now.
2047600	2049440	That's the Orthodox church of Russia right now.
2049440	2056160	That's the original church that fled Constantinople in 1453 and a century
2056160	2063600	later, Ivan the terrible, his grandmother was the niece of the last Roman emperor.
2064480	2068880	Who flew, who died during the siege of Constantinople.
2070040	2072000	So you have a direct lineage.
2072000	2073440	That's why he called up the czar.
2073640	2076000	He's the first czar of Russia.
2076280	2076640	Yeah.
2076800	2077600	The Kaiser.
2077600	2078520	He's making us up.
2078520	2082840	He was, he was saying, I'm, I'm legitimately tracing myself back to the
2082840	2083920	Constantine dynasty.
2084760	2085400	Oh man.
2085400	2087000	That's so arouses me.
2087040	2088480	That's so arouses me.
2088880	2092840	Uh, so tell me a little, tell me a little bit more about these people.
2092840	2096960	So they tell you, they're like, Hey, in support of the roost.
2097360	2100240	Did, um, did you know what side you're on?
2100240	2101480	That's why I like this.
2101480	2107320	That's why I, I understand why these Christians, these Twitter Catholics are
2107360	2109040	like, Putin did nothing wrong.
2109320	2110480	I get why they're like that.
2110520	2111200	You're, you're right.
2111200	2111760	You're damn right.
2111760	2112480	You're on that side.
2112480	2113640	You should be on that side.
2114000	2114720	Let's get real.
2114720	2116320	You're, that's the side you're supposed to be on.
2116800	2117080	Yeah.
2117160	2120960	I'm supposed to be on the other side, the side of democracy, the side of Athena.
2121720	2122040	Yeah.
2122560	2126040	My own family wants everybody to die.
2126040	2126560	Right.
2126560	2132840	I mean, we all have family like this who are evangelicals or steeped in the
2132880	2136840	conservative fundamentalist Christianity or somehow influenced by it.
2137240	2144160	They want Vlad to sweep down and surround Israel because that's when Jesus is
2144160	2147280	coming back and according to them, right?
2147320	2152680	According to their bull, their BS, um, can't read the original text approach.
2152720	2153160	Right.
2154280	2159240	And, and they, that's why, you know, the Christians actually say now, people should
2159240	2161520	know this, this is a public service I'm doing.
2162000	2162240	Right.
2162240	2167400	People, people should know that the Christians are saying that there is no
2167400	2171720	America in the book of revelation.
2172240	2172800	Right.
2172880	2173960	There's no America.
2174160	2182080	So America must really fall before Vlad can sweep down and surround Israel.
2182080	2186480	Cause when he does that, the bear, when the bear does that, the text calls him,
2186840	2192200	then Jesus can crack, come in the world and boom, murder and mayhem can
2192200	2197680	take, take off like a, and they're going to push to get those things done so that
2197680	2200560	they can legitimately say, it's my religion.
2200560	2201320	I got to follow it.
2201680	2203280	I got to do as it's my religion.
2203720	2207480	And so, and that's why you get this push against degeneracy.
2208080	2213400	So they call it putans, putan cleaning up the degenerates, those degenerates, you
2213400	2218200	know, all those, all those, uh, those degenerate, uh, atheists and, and all
2218200	2223240	those, uh, you know, all those gays and all those LGBTQ degenerate.
2223240	2229000	That's what that, that this is what this is, this is their, this is the way they
2229000	2229720	see the world.
2230120	2230360	Yeah.
2230360	2236520	And so putan as out to them is on the, on the side of, of God in there to them.
2237120	2241440	Well, we know, we know it's, it's, he's, he's evil.
2241480	2242040	We know that.
2242400	2247120	You gotta know by the fact that he blows people up randomly with rockets, you
2247120	2249560	know, like mothers and children.
2249600	2251440	I mean, this is what I don't get.
2251760	2256360	You know, Jesus says directly, I'm going to take all those liars and I'm going
2256360	2257600	to feed them to the birds.
2257640	2259480	He's such a good gangster leader.
2259520	2259920	You know what I mean?
2259920	2261520	He's such a good mob boss.
2261920	2268160	He's like, Peter, Peter, take those people and feed them to the birds.
2268520	2268960	Right.
2268960	2272120	We, I mean, there's, there's nothing better than this.
2272440	2272760	What?
2274200	2274680	Yeah.
2274960	2276360	Yeah.
2276360	2282040	And I saw an angel right standing in the sun and he shouted in a great voice
2282040	2287040	saying, um, to all the birds flying around in midair.
2287320	2288720	He says, come now soon.
2289560	2295000	Assemble at the banquet, the great banquet of God.
2295440	2296200	And it goes on.
2297040	2301880	The text goes on to talk about feeding us to these birds.
2302640	2303160	Yeah.
2303200	2304880	Feeding us to these birds.
2304920	2306640	That's where we're going.
2307080	2312320	So it doesn't, it, it only makes sense that modern evangelicals can say, um,
2312320	2313920	what Putin is doing is good.
2313920	2315320	We can excuse lies.
2315320	2318120	Have you noticed Christianity that yells?
2318160	2321880	I heard the guy debating you talking about moral authority.
2322280	2322520	Right.
2322520	2326080	They think, oh, I'm for family values and moral authority.
2326360	2327280	You got none.
2327720	2334320	You got zero because you will take a liar and exalt, bring up that
2334320	2338400	liar to a position and you will bow to a liar.
2338880	2343320	And we all know, we all know that those liars get fed to those birds.
2343800	2344080	Right.
2344080	2345880	That's the life, right?
2345920	2347880	That's what I thought about this.
2348200	2354200	I thought about this hard is that I actually have this weird respect.
2355160	2360680	And I hate to say this, but like, at least the fundamentalist are consistent
2361040	2364440	and following what the text tells them, where you have these people on the
2364440	2370680	sidelines who I don't respect, who cherry pick and it's like a buffet of the
2370680	2373640	Bible's a buffet where they can just, I like this part.
2373680	2374880	I don't, I don't like that part.
2374880	2379400	So I'm going to somehow pretend it's not there or, or even just rationalize
2379400	2382840	it away by explaining it how I want to explain it.
2383240	2388240	And then you, and then what you're doing is you want, you are making it so
2388240	2390800	that the fundamentalists can stay legitimate.
2391720	2395360	Because if you, if you just, if the people on the sidelines who, who are
2395360	2401040	the moderates who are, you know, using the Bible, like, like a, like a salad bar,
2401240	2404920	if they actually just said, you know what, this, this text is, this text is
2404920	2405560	just evil.
2405760	2406360	I'm out of here.
2406800	2409920	Then there were, then the fundamentals would be looking like looking naked
2409920	2411040	in the middle of the street.
2411400	2415120	They would just be target, like they would be wide open.
2415160	2416480	There'd be no one to cover for them.
2416480	2417320	They'd have nothing.
2418520	2422320	That's cause they're the reason why that the, the fundamentalists are still around.
2422840	2424520	People, you get the moderates.
2426400	2431440	Do people push you, um, like to say, Oh, don't be so hard on the Christians.
2431440	2432360	You ever get any comment?
2432360	2434720	Like, don't, all the time.
2434920	2435200	Yeah.
2435360	2441000	You know what, but I was, I was, I went, I was at a church for years.
2441280	2449800	That really has an impact that really is like pushing, pushing ideas into the
2449800	2456000	world that are really negative impact, climate change, El Pro, uh, accepting
2456000	2458560	people who they are, all that stuff goes out the window.
2458560	2461680	And this is, these are churches at every corner that you can think of.
2461680	2464120	Like this is every city, every town has that.
2464640	2466280	It's not, it's not a small thing.
2466280	2467120	It's a big thing.
2467960	2469000	It's a big, it's a big pop.
2469000	2472600	It's a big population of people that are pushing these ideas.
2473200	2476440	I'm sorry, but I'm just going to, that's, that's where I'm at right now.
2476480	2479600	If you can convince me otherwise, but I've seen it, seen it first hand.
2480000	2484480	I know what I was, I was one of the people who, on the email list for January 6th,
2485040	2488560	say, Hey, everybody, we, if you need to bust, if you need to ride there, we'll
2488560	2489320	send you out there.
2489760	2491000	We need to support Trump.
2491400	2493360	I was one of those people who were on that email list.
2494040	2496120	I'm just saying, so I'm coming out of that world.
2496120	2497600	So that's why I do what I do.
2498560	2500200	You don't have to do it, but I do it, you know?
2500720	2501040	Yeah.
2501080	2504480	And it was a Christian flag that was first, you know, everybody listened to
2504480	2505760	what Neil said, right?
2505760	2509920	It was a Christian flag that went first into that, into that capital.
2509960	2515400	Those people, Neil, that tell you you're, you're being too harsh on the Christians.
2516320	2516880	Right.
2516920	2523480	Um, those are the people who in the first century AD, as Christianity was becoming
2523480	2529400	more and more radicalized, and people were saying, we have to burn down this
2529400	2532600	place, right, in order to get him to come back.
2533680	2539760	Um, that's the kind of, that's the kind of the person who stood back at the time
2539760	2541880	and said, Oh, don't be hard on the Christians.
2542400	2548680	That was the person who, uh, helped facilitate the fall, um, of Rome.
2548840	2550280	They, an order.
2550280	2552200	And when I say Rome, I mean, order.
2552320	2553120	That's a good point.
2553160	2554200	That was such a good point.
2555480	2556080	Exactly.
2556280	2557000	It's what I'm saying.
2557000	2563920	It's, it's the people who are the moderates that kind of cover for the
2563920	2566920	fundamentalist types that, that do the most damage.
2567080	2567480	Right.
2567920	2571440	Cause without, it's like that you, you're the gateway to that path.
2571480	2573800	You're the reason why that, that thing exists.
2574040	2574360	Yeah.
2574560	2574880	Yeah.
2575000	2581160	You know, you know, when the Taliban was, was gaining strength in Afghanistan, you
2581160	2585760	know, that there were a certain percentage of a population that said, Oh,
2585760	2588680	this is, this can't be that bad, right?
2589600	2597600	Whereas, uh, so it's, if we can, if, if we can, uh, show those people the future,
2598400	2602960	um, before it happens, they can correct, but that's unfortunate.
2602960	2606920	You know, unless you've got, unless you've got oracles and different sources,
2606920	2612800	you were talking earlier about polytheism, remember, people don't think this way,
2612800	2618680	but there's, uh, uh, there are oracles spread all over the place that give you
2618680	2623640	the voice of God, whether it's she or he, right?
2623920	2625400	It doesn't matter.
2625800	2631000	Um, and you can go obtain that voice in one place that's different from another.
2631160	2639400	That inherent flexibility of the system, of a system that is, uh, integrates the
2639400	2643320	populace that thrives on diversity, right?
2643320	2643880	That's what I'm saying.
2644040	2653120	That the, the layout of that system sort of produces, uh, a zeitgeist.
2653120	2655880	That's, that's not top bottom.
2655920	2657080	It's not patriarchal.
2657120	2661520	It's not, here's the one, one king on top and then the servants.
2661800	2664080	It's more like spread out.
2665080	2668800	You have these different, different institutions with their own certain types
2668800	2670960	of power that there's a balance happening.
2672280	2672720	You know what I mean?
2672720	2673920	More of a balance.
2673960	2674600	Balance.
2674600	2677160	That's a, that's a Greek idea, right?
2677200	2680000	Not, not today invented it, but that was big in their minds.
2680000	2685440	You have to achieve balance and become in thug life where you're selling
2685440	2690760	everything that you own and putting it at the feet of some thug who's going to
2690800	2693200	murder you if you don't give it all up.
2693440	2693840	Look at that.
2693840	2694280	Right.
2694720	2698560	By the way, how did people, how did Peter know that he didn't give it all up
2698560	2704360	unless he either had spies where he had access to the sale itself, which since Jesus
2704360	2709760	was so hooked into the, to the tax collectors, it's probably likely that
2709760	2713880	Peter knew exactly cause that, all of that has to be registered.
2714160	2717360	But not only that, it's a message to the next person coming.
2718080	2719680	So you remember what happened to Ann and I.
2719680	2723400	Is there enough, you better give me all that money.
2723680	2725600	You better not keep a penny for yourself.
2726000	2728640	And in eyes, you drop dead right away.
2729120	2733320	It's like a, it's when a mafia leaves the horse head in the bed.
2734440	2735360	It's a message.
2735480	2736120	That's what it is.
2736120	2738000	It's just a strike fear in the people.
2738360	2738680	Yeah.
2738840	2741440	If you come here and you join us, you get initiated.
2741840	2742120	Yeah.
2742280	2746680	You better give us all your riches, sell all your property and don't keep anything
2746680	2747320	for yourself.
2747440	2748760	Don't dare do that.
2748800	2749560	Are you dead?
2750160	2752320	But that's, that's intense, man.
2752560	2758720	If you are a modern Christian and you own property and you have, I don't know,
2758720	2763400	stocks, um, and you have a real Christian.
2764560	2766520	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2766880	2771200	You are an aberration that developed over 2000 years.
2773000	2773480	Yeah.
2774040	2776600	The doesn't, doesn't make sense to me, man.
2776640	2779200	But okay, let's let me get through one more.
2779560	2781200	We got Ponto Crotor, right?
2781200	2781920	What's this about?
2782000	2782360	Yeah.
2782360	2783720	Here's the Ponto Crotor.
2783720	2791560	Remember I said the Ponto Crotor is the title that's used by, um, uh, Hermes,
2792000	2794920	the Angulos, the messenger of Zeus.
2795280	2795560	Yeah.
2795560	2796000	Right.
2796040	2801000	Jesus in Revelation, not only calls himself that messenger.
2801200	2801720	He's the other.
2802600	2807680	But even the text itself, John says another angel, Jesus comes out at one
2807680	2811960	point, um, uh, with a sickle in his hand, we're going to look at it in a minute.
2812320	2816080	And then another, it says another angel steps out with a sickle.
2816360	2821680	So Jesus is very much putting himself into this specific role.
2822120	2822640	Right.
2822640	2824240	What's he got a sickle for?
2824560	2827480	You know what he's got a sickle for to cut your guts out.
2829080	2829640	Yeah.
2829680	2830240	Yeah.
2830240	2832040	And what are they all yelling?
2832040	2834200	You know, Jesus is Lord, et cetera, et cetera.
2834440	2834800	Okay.
2834800	2835360	Next one.
2837360	2837680	Kai.
2837800	2838160	Yeah.
2838160	2838400	Yeah.
2838440	2841280	And I saw the heaven, the heaven open.
2841280	2841560	Yeah.
2841840	2842240	Okay.
2842240	2844960	Here's the description of gangster Jesus.
2845040	2845600	Are you ready?
2846200	2851200	And I looked, I saw the heaven open, open.
2852040	2852440	Yeah.
2852480	2857340	And look, there was a white horse and there was one seated on the horse called
2857340	2859460	faithful and, and true.
2860220	2867220	And in his right hand, he holds a, um, sorry, with his right hand.
2867260	2867940	Oh, hang on.
2868140	2869580	The guy was in a clinic.
2869580	2870820	Kai polemic.
2871100	2877860	He, um, rules with righteousness and he polemic and he makes war.
2878180	2879260	He makes war.
2879260	2880820	Nobody talks about Jesus make war.
2880820	2884420	We don't have any murals of Jesus, the war maker, right?
2884420	2887580	But this is what characterizes the thug leader.
2888940	2889540	Yes.
2889540	2890100	Right.
2890140	2890500	Right.
2890820	2892660	He's literally calling himself the war monger.
2893180	2893540	Yeah.
2893900	2896180	And he's also injected in his eyes.
2896180	2897620	He's got the flocks.
2897900	2902180	He's got that purple, that burning purple in his eyes and it's the flocks.
2902220	2903060	Poor us.
2903420	2907020	That expression is used in Orphic, uh, mystery.
2907020	2909820	It's like Al Pacino with this, with the cocaine on his nose.
2910020	2910380	Yeah.
2910460	2911100	Exactly.
2911100	2912380	He's lit up.
2912860	2913700	He's lit up.
2914180	2916140	This is thanks to Jesus right here.
2917260	2918900	And he's got lots of gold.
2918900	2919940	He's got bling.
2920060	2921020	He's got bling.
2921020	2923020	He's got crowns, right?
2923060	2927460	He's got a ton of bling and he has a name, right?
2927500	2929340	Jesus has a tat, right?
2929580	2930420	And he has a name.
2930420	2931220	Oh, yeah, yeah.
2931220	2935620	The next one, the next one, Jesus has a tattoo on his thigh.
2935900	2939100	A name, king of kings and lord of, think about that.
2939100	2941260	You know, you got the old English tattoos.
2941660	2942020	Yeah.
2942420	2944860	He's got that old Aramaic tattoo going on.
2944860	2946580	King of kings and lord of lords.
2947460	2949980	You know, that, uh, but that's what is it?
2949980	2952380	That siriac, that siriac font.
2954180	2954700	You know what I mean?
2954700	2957060	He's got that tattoo with that siriac tattoo.
2957540	2961140	Why do you think he, why do you think he tattooed his thigh with it?
2961660	2962460	Cause he's a G.
2962500	2963980	He's Jesus, the G.
2964500	2965500	He's G-man.
2965780	2966180	Yeah.
2966820	2967340	Yeah.
2970340	2974900	This is so, this is so, I honestly, when you look at it this way though,
2974900	2976700	it almost makes sense.
2980380	2981860	It makes better sense.
2981860	2982420	It does.
2982420	2983340	The fairy tale.
2983340	2984260	Better sense.
2984300	2984700	Yeah.
2984700	2985740	That they come up with.
2985780	2990180	Can you imagine him flashing it like he lifts up his, he lifts up his gown and
2990180	2992380	he's like, Hey, take a look at this.
2992580	2993780	You know, in my fur.
2994780	2997740	Oh, and it's funny because they're ride or die.
2997740	2998500	They're martyrs.
2998500	3001220	They're going to ride or die for their click, for their gang.
3001220	3004580	They're not going to, you're not letting them, you're not going to get over on them.
3004580	3006340	They're going to die for that shit.
3006340	3013660	Like that's a mentality that you see in the mafia and the Italian and the Spanish
3013660	3016380	and like that's a, that's real.
3016380	3019500	Like that's, that's no joke.
3020500	3026260	And imagine though, you've got this drug using gang who's, who's, uh, who's
3026260	3031300	principal leaders or, or immune to Venoms, right?
3031300	3035580	And Jesus is like, I'll make you so that you can drink this stuff and it won't
3035580	3037380	hurt you at all, right?
3037380	3039740	So, you know, the drugs are there from the beginning.
3039740	3042580	You know, the drugs are there with them when he gets arrested.
3042580	3044780	So it's a part of the culture.
3044780	3049180	Your comparison to gang is, I think it's straight on, man.
3049940	3052100	Look at how the popes dictated their lives.
3052100	3056220	Like the, they had the Pope Alexander in the 16th, 15th century.
3057060	3061540	He had an enemy that wanted to be the pope and this guy does become pope.
3062020	3063700	It's Pope Julius.
3063700	3067740	He has two popes later, but this pope didn't want, didn't want to wait around.
3067740	3070220	He wanted to end this pope's life so he can become the next pope.
3070700	3076100	Well, he, he ended up apparently, according to the sources, he, uh, he had
3076100	3080340	an, uh, altar boy child and he was giving him poison every day.
3080660	3083660	Enough that it wouldn't kill him, but he would become immune to it.
3084140	3088100	And then he got him hired as the pope's wine checker.
3089420	3093020	So he would be able to drink the wine and poison in it and he wouldn't die.
3093260	3095100	Well, the whole operation failed.
3095100	3095740	The kid died.
3096700	3101660	But like that, but that tells you the mindset of this church, man.
3102100	3105500	This is like, these are like mafia bosses fighting over the throne.
3105980	3106340	Yeah.
3106780	3110860	And they're, when this is, this is the highest, highest Christianity has to
3110860	3115100	offer the papacy and the world, they're operating like my bosses.
3115300	3116420	Why do you think that is?
3118020	3120380	You think it's just a reality.
3120420	3124260	You know, it's just like, that's the way the things go when you got lots of money
3124260	3129740	involved and lots of power and sex, you know, you just, it's going to lean
3129740	3134020	toward this hierarchy of there's going to be one thug and he's going to run
3134020	3134860	everything.
3135300	3135740	Right.
3135740	3139660	So yeah, I didn't think, you know, I didn't think they were sitting around.
3139700	3142340	Ha, ha, ha, ha, right.
3142660	3145900	I, I didn't think that was the reason everybody was there.
3145900	3146260	Right.
3146540	3149980	We all know it's, you can take those altar boys into the basement.
3150660	3151420	You know what I mean?
3151540	3154340	And you can do things with that's power.
3154620	3155380	That's what they're asking.
3155660	3157180	That's real power, man.
3157220	3158380	Jesus has that.
3158860	3162140	Let me see that, that long, that long one that I had with him on the white
3162140	3163700	horse, just go back one.
3164260	3166540	No, maybe it's one more.
3168180	3169300	No, that's okay.
3169340	3169700	That's okay.
3169700	3170780	Let's just, I'm sorry.
3170780	3171140	This one.
3171460	3172340	Yeah, there we go.
3172380	3172700	Yeah.
3172700	3175820	And he's going to, he's going to destroy the nations, man.
3175820	3176900	He's going to rule them.
3177140	3178860	Says below, he's going to rule them.
3178900	3180820	And there's a little phrase in Rob doi.
3182060	3188540	See, did I, it's with a rod of iron, but that Rob done people don't recognize
3188540	3190700	that Rob done is a religious instrument.
3191140	3193620	It's used also by the Balkans, right?
3193940	3195460	And his is made of iron.
3195460	3196180	You know why?
3196380	3198940	So he can bang, bust your head open with it.
3199500	3200860	That's gangster.
3200860	3203180	This Jesus seated on a white horse.
3203500	3204900	He's gangster brought.
3204900	3209300	And by the way, we see in the beginning, he's got his bow and he's got that poison
3209300	3209740	with him.
3209740	3212580	So, and here again, he's called the Pantocrontor.
3212820	3214740	Oh, but one last thing from this.
3215060	3218180	Look at one, two, three, four, five lines from the bottom.
3218180	3219900	This is in verse 19.
3220540	3223540	Yeah, it says, pate tein leinon.
3223860	3226660	He is treading the wine press.
3227140	3229460	That leinon is the wine press.
3229460	3234500	And you should have one, Neil, that is the hymn to Linnaean Dionysus.
3234900	3235700	Yeah, look at this.
3235740	3236180	Look at this.
3236180	3237540	They call him Lyceus, right?
3237540	3240180	The releaser, the freer, right?
3240700	3244420	The, that lane route is the press for the wine.
3244780	3249460	And for those of you who think for those of you who think that they were
3250300	3252180	you know, God is comparing himself.
3252180	3254700	He's constantly saying, I'm this wine presser.
3254940	3258180	They didn't have wine, except in Canaan.
3258180	3262300	The Egyptians got it from the Canaanites, right?
3262300	3267580	Because in Canaan, which is not a Semitic word, it's a Hurrian word.
3268100	3271300	It's a Hurrian word and they were not Indo-European.
3271900	3273780	And it means, guess what it means?
3273780	3275260	It means purple.
3275260	3276820	Yeah, I've seen this before.
3276820	3278460	That's mind blowing.
3278460	3282340	Yeah, yeah, at the bottom, at the bottom, I just want you to
3282340	3286180	notice the last nine here, Rhexikhthon and Linnaean.
3286220	3290500	Linnaean is that God who treads out the grapes, right?
3290500	3291740	That's from Revelation.
3291740	3293340	And this is talking about Dionysus.
3293780	3295540	This isn't a hymn to Dionysus.
3295540	3297260	What is that word being Megasthenus?
3297300	3299180	And the second last word, Megasthenus.
3299460	3301500	Having incredible strength.
3301900	3302340	Oh, OK.
3302340	3304140	Nye is having incredible strength.
3304140	3306100	He's Rhexikhthon.
3306420	3312340	He is literally busting the earth or jamming something into the earth.
3312700	3317500	And guess what we have in one of these texts that I sent you, Nyeal,
3317500	3324900	it talks about Jesus with the Saturnian scythe or sickle jamming it down
3324900	3325980	into the earth.
3326740	3327380	Yeah.
3329180	3330180	Oh, yeah, here it is.
3330220	3334540	I see, behold, the white cloud and upon the cloud sat one unto the
3334540	3340740	Son of Man, having on his head a golden crown, a crusone, and the
3340740	3344900	Stefanon, crusone Stefanon, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
3345980	3346820	Drepanon.
3347180	3348620	Yeah, yeah.
3349100	3355820	He's got that sickle and he's about to jam it into the earth as his judgment,
3355820	3356140	right?
3356140	3358780	This is the exact same thing that Dionysus does.
3358820	3359820	I'm not kidding you.
3361140	3366260	For hundreds of years, the workers of Bacchus, they would hear this
3366260	3368140	and they'd be like, oh, yeah, he's Bacchus.
3368740	3372020	Yeah, that's that's what I'm trying to know.
3372500	3374020	So that's what I learned from you.
3374020	3377060	And this is what I'm trying to relate to people is that the language
3377060	3379700	in Greek in any doesn't matter what it is.
3380420	3387060	When you're speaking Celtic language in in Greek, it's going to ring bells
3387060	3389940	in people's ears in the Greek world, especially people
3389940	3395220	living in Phrygia, people living in Corinth or the church at Thessalonica.
3395500	3397900	These people are growing up in the Orphic mysteries.
3397900	3398980	They're all around them.
3399260	3403180	This is this is stuff that's this is familiar language to them.
3404500	3407940	And we lose this context when we, because we're in an English-speaking
3407940	3410380	world that's a thousand years removed from this.
3410420	3412620	We have no idea the context anymore.
3412620	3416780	It's gone, but that's what this is the work you've been doing that I'm
3416780	3419500	trying to trying to give to the people.
3419500	3423860	Like there's some context in this reason why they're using this language.
3424860	3426780	Sure, that's Saturnian.
3426980	3429140	Yeah, it's Kronos has the sickle.
3429140	3432940	He's the one who comes in, you know, they have the Thanatos, the God of death.
3433260	3434900	This this is all in Revelation.
3434900	3438780	It's not like this is not like I'm pulling out of the airs.
3439060	3443220	He even says Thanatos death and Hades gave up their dead and then
3443220	3444540	they're throwing them like a fire.
3444900	3445340	Right.
3445340	3447980	And even in the Christian, even in the Christian
3447980	3452940	manuscript or in the editions of the New Testament, you'll see Hades
3452940	3454900	capitalized, right?
3454980	3457300	Because he he's a person.
3457300	3459340	He's the king of the underworld, right?
3459580	3462580	And even see where it says the sea gave up its dead.
3462820	3464700	Yeah, I'm not I'm not kidding.
3464700	3469140	When I first read that, I remember thinking like, well, you have Hades
3469140	3472540	and you have you have death and Hades, the sea.
3472580	3476420	And I didn't know until recently, when I started reading the Orphic hymns,
3476900	3478900	there was a hymn to thought Thosala.
3479180	3480660	Yeah, him to the sea.
3480660	3482300	The sea is also a deity.
3482620	3483700	Yeah.
3483700	3485540	No, they got all there.
3485540	3486700	It's all in Revelation.
3486700	3487380	It's all there.
3487380	3489220	And it's all Saturnian, too.
3489220	3491740	And that's that's why when you read these hymns, you're shocked.
3491740	3494260	You're like, wait a minute, they're using the exact same symbols.
3494260	3498460	The image that they're using in Christianity, which only makes sense.
3498860	3501500	I mean, come on, they didn't sit around and Jesus didn't say,
3501740	3502900	let me make up something.
3502900	3504420	Yeah, let me just pull out of this.
3504420	3507220	Pull this out of the out of the void of some black hole.
3507220	3513340	Like these are ideas that come passed down from other ideas, the evolution.
3513340	3514940	All ideas come from something.
3514940	3516820	Yeah. Yeah.
3516820	3518780	All right, let's finish these quotes because I'm.
3518780	3520660	Yeah, these are great.
3520660	3521860	We're on fire right now.
3521860	3524020	So this is one Jesus kills and feeds to the birds.
3524020	3525180	We did this one, right?
3525180	3526020	Yeah, we did that one.
3526020	3528300	Oh, no, here's the one we got to read.
3528300	3528620	Here's.
3528620	3530420	Oh, OK.
3531060	3535740	This is like, this is admitting that you're on some G shit right here.
3535740	3538140	This is there's no hiding it.
3538140	3541900	These shall hate the whore and shall make her desolate naked.
3542300	3544700	She'll ease her flesh and burn her with fire.
3545900	3549540	For God had put in their hearts to fulfill his will.
3549940	3554500	Yeah, that's why I like to start with the ending of that one, right?
3554500	3556140	Which is at the bottom in Greek.
3556140	3558700	It literally just says they all said they can.
3558980	3567740	God gave into their hearts the idea, right, to follow his Nome, right?
3567740	3570820	His desire and what is his?
3570820	3572380	What is God's desire then?
3572380	3574900	What does he have in his mind to do?
3575500	3579060	They're going to me say something, they're going to hate her
3579660	3584980	and they're going to stripper naked and they're going to
3585460	3589060	consume her flesh.
3589060	3592700	And this word for flesh, sarks, there's a reason that Paul
3592700	3594580	associates it with sexuality.
3594580	3597700	He says, don't follow the flesh, follow the spirit.
3598260	3601540	This sarks is the fleshy pulp of a fruit.
3601980	3604780	When you bite into it and you get all that juice out of it.
3605220	3610620	That's what that's what they are consuming of her
3611140	3614700	after she has been thrown into this bed.
3615220	3618500	Right, she's going to be thrown into this bed and they're going
3618500	3622780	to cut the calcium, they're going to burn her up in the fire.
3622780	3626460	Now, this is what's weird, is that cut the cow is used
3626460	3631740	in religious concept context and it's used to burn that piece
3631740	3636500	of incense that you get that Smyrna that comes from between the legs
3636500	3641940	of Aphrodite, you burn that and it creates an odor, right?
3641940	3643660	So what is going on?
3643700	3650460	God is sitting there watching this orgy, this rape orgy, right?
3650460	3656220	That ends up in her getting totally consumed and it's what's in his mind.
3656340	3659820	And don't forget, don't forget this, but right before this or not
3659820	3664700	right before this, a few 15 chapters before this, he's coming out
3664700	3668620	and saying, nevertheless, talking to the church of Pergamon,
3668620	3673020	saying that woman, Jezebel, I will cast her on a bed.
3673700	3676380	And send my minions to rape her.
3676500	3679180	Yeah, that's the mistranslation in the English.
3679420	3681940	The Bart Ehrman pointed this out.
3682140	3684220	And I asked you about it and you were like, he's not on it.
3684220	3687220	Bart's spot on, that's what the Greek says.
3687580	3690180	And then it says, I will strike her children dead.
3690980	3693020	We're murdering children now?
3694420	3697580	And then he says on the bottom, I'm the morning star.
3698420	3701580	He say, right after he says, those are the people who will learn
3701580	3705380	of the deep things of Satan, I'm the morning star.
3705540	3709820	Yeah, that's like, what's he's saying?
3709820	3711340	You know, there's Satanists.
3711340	3713340	No, they had nothing on me.
3713340	3714620	I'm Lucifer.
3714620	3719660	Which that's how I'm reading you right now.
3719660	3723260	But like it's it's what it sounds like.
3723740	3725460	He moves in on the territory.
3725460	3726500	He takes it over.
3726500	3728700	He's the new leader, man.
3728700	3729260	He's the new.
3729260	3731220	You think you know about this stuff?
3731700	3732820	Yeah, watch this.
3732820	3734580	Yeah, now I'm going to kill you all.
3736740	3740340	Yeah, this and look at this and look and low.
3740340	3746700	A lamb stood on the Mount Sion and with him 144,000, having his
3746700	3749140	father's name written in their foreheads.
3749780	3751660	Now here's some more gang stuff right here.
3751980	3756740	And I heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters, as the voice
3756740	3758020	of the great thunder.
3758340	3761540	And I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps.
3761700	3763300	There's that Orphic imagery right there.
3763620	3768380	And they sung as it would the new song before the throne and before
3768380	3772780	the four beasts and the elders and no man could learn that song.
3773140	3779260	But the 144,000, which were redeemed, these which were not defiled
3779260	3781900	with the woman, for they are virgins.
3782420	3786380	What's Jesus doing with 144,000 virgins?
3786380	3790460	And I'll bet you they're branded with a with a with a tattoo on their
3790460	3791340	foreheads.
3791420	3794060	Yeah, of course they are because they're sex slaves.
3794300	3794900	Exactly.
3794900	3796260	That's the whole point of that verse.
3796740	3798380	Yeah, that's crazy.
3798980	3799380	Yeah.
3799780	3804140	And by the way, when it says they are virgins, that's that's not like
3804140	3807300	physically, that's that's like a cultically.
3807660	3809140	Like it means like they're mine.
3809180	3810500	They only belong to me.
3811260	3811620	Right.
3811660	3812460	Am I right about that?
3813060	3814820	They're Parthenon calls them.
3814820	3815980	I checked this one out.
3815980	3816980	They're Parthenon.
3817420	3823500	So it's it, you know, we talk about Athena Parthenos, right?
3823660	3828780	I'm saying in the context that he's saying, he's saying that these only
3828780	3830020	they only belong to me.
3830020	3831740	Nobody else has access to them.
3831940	3833100	They're my slaves.
3833180	3834260	Right, right, right, right.
3835020	3835900	No, exactly.
3835900	3837660	That's exactly that's dark.
3837660	3837820	Yeah.
3838300	3841060	That's why it troubles me when he's arrested in the Garden of
3841060	3843420	Gethsemane at 4 a.m. with a naked boy.
3843740	3848020	Mark says that that boy was assigned to him, right?
3848020	3855580	That he was it uses a verb that you only use with slaves and military.
3855980	3856220	Right.
3856220	3858900	You can talk about somebody in the military being assigned.
3859500	3859860	Right.
3859860	3866620	So it's like what's going on here that Jesus is attracting to himself.
3866940	3872340	These, you know, slaves who are, you know, in this case, they're virgins.
3872700	3876460	And, you know, is it and he's yelling, I'm not a pirate.
3876460	3878020	I'm not a kid trafficker.
3878380	3880340	You didn't have to come out with the big weapons.
3880340	3881700	I'm not a kid trafficker.
3882020	3882380	Right.
3882820	3883260	Yeah.
3883500	3887180	Peter, though, what do you think gang wise when Peter took off, right?
3887180	3887900	Jesus is there.
3887900	3889140	The boy takes off.
3889500	3895220	Peter starts swinging with a sword, knocks off that guy's ear and then takes off.
3896020	3901820	Uh, do you think it's just like, um, gang lord got taken down, right?
3901820	3906660	So, uh, we're going to step off and then does Peter just decide along the
3906660	3910700	way he's like, Hey, I've got the apparatus going here.
3910980	3915460	I've got enough followers that we can liquidate all of their cash and we can
3915460	3918980	drive, drive this, this gang forward.
3919500	3919860	I don't know.
3919860	3920460	What do you think?
3921420	3922420	He's the Petros.
3922420	3923300	He's the rock.
3923700	3924820	He's the under boss.
3925260	3930020	He's like under the Godfather, there's that, that, that, that, that, you know,
3930020	3933620	the main boss that's right underneath and get, he's the one doing that, making
3933620	3935060	sure everything gets done right.
3935780	3938860	And so I'm not surprised that he's pulling out a weapon.
3938860	3942500	Make sure things get done the way it needs to be done.
3942500	3944700	Like he can't, you know, and then, and then what happens?
3944700	3945940	Jesus, no, no, no, no, no, no.
3946420	3946980	Put it away.
3947820	3948140	Okay.
3948180	3948500	Okay.
3948500	3949380	Boss, you got it.
3949860	3953180	It's like a scene out of a scene out of a Godfather scene right there.
3953180	3953740	You know what I mean?
3954300	3955980	Like put the gun down, Tony.
3956980	3961980	That's Petra, but you know, he's the one who ends up starting the church, right?
3962260	3963620	He was the one who goes to the room.
3964340	3968980	And, uh, so that's, that's, that's the original Godfather, the first pope right
3968980	3971700	there, according to the tradition.
3973740	3974300	Are you muted?
3977620	3978100	You muted.
3979820	3982060	Peter ends up in and out of jail too.
3982060	3985700	So they, they're catching on to what he's doing.
3985700	3991740	I mean, he, he obviously is making a presence and he's able to get out of jail.
3992060	3994980	It, it makes you wonder, look, Judas was there, right?
3994980	3998540	We all know Judas was an informant, right?
3998660	3999380	No problem.
3999460	4000420	He's an informant.
4001220	4006980	How much, to what extent could those three guys that were with Jesus when he got
4006980	4012220	arrested with that naked kid, what were they, how much could they have been in it?
4012820	4017980	Do you think Peter could possibly have known that things were going down with
4017980	4018580	Judas?
4018580	4024620	Do you think that was, he just tried to make a show like, you know, if he can
4024620	4028420	kill Anna nice on the spot, he could have killed that guy that he swung at.
4028420	4032940	Was he just, was he just trying to, you know, make a show or something?
4034100	4035740	No, I think, I think he was ready.
4036060	4037820	I think he was ready for something to pop off.
4037860	4038780	I think there was something.
4039500	4040740	Yeah, I think you're, I think you're on.
4041140	4042620	And, and, you know, Dr.
4042620	4047780	Tabor talks about this is that people want to make it seem like Jesus and Peter
4047780	4051860	were a bunch of poor fishermen that had no, no, no, no, no.
4051860	4057140	This is, you know, people don't, people don't remember or talk about or write
4057140	4061660	about or fixate on people who are just randomly homeless.
4061940	4068540	Like this is probably some wealthy, like, you know, some sort of movement happening.
4068660	4069900	There's something going on here.
4069940	4071620	There's some, this is a movement.
4072180	4077300	This is not just some little group of people that magically blew up and became
4077300	4079980	the world, the state religion of the Roman Empire.
4080300	4083700	This is a systematic movement that's going on.
4084820	4088700	You've got to think if they, if they become so popular, they spread all
4088700	4089820	the way over to Rome.
4090180	4090500	Right.
4090740	4097020	And if you're thinking that Peter is taking people's goods and redistributing.
4097340	4097620	Yeah.
4098020	4100380	And he's, and he's taken everybody.
4100380	4105500	I mean, how many people, I mean, and it can be anybody, wealthy people, I'm
4105500	4107100	sure, also got involved.
4107380	4108020	Absolutely.
4108380	4112820	How much, if the movement is so big that it spreads to Rome and throughout Asia
4112820	4116500	minor, how much did people bring to Peter's feet?
4116900	4120180	I'll bet he had the most gold on the planet.
4121540	4121860	Yeah.
4122100	4126780	Oh, if you have, I'm going to Toronto in two weeks to talk to, uh,
4127260	4130700	Professor Kloppenborg at Toronto University, he wrote a book about this,
4130700	4135860	that's called Christ Associations, where he documented, he's looking at all
4135860	4142180	like the stellies and stones and, and like, in like imprints in, in catacombs.
4142540	4144900	And he's putting together the pieces of the puzzle.
4145300	4150100	And these are like early Christian labor or labor unions, basically.
4150620	4151820	They're organized.
4152260	4158220	They're all like the, like the city of Corinth, the stone masons had had a church
4158260	4159300	and they were organized.
4159540	4164260	The city of Alexandria, the wood carpenters, they had a church, they were
4164260	4164620	organized.
4164820	4167660	This is an organized network of assemblies.
4168060	4171340	And he even the first thing, the first thing he does in the first chapter is he
4171340	4173900	redefines that word Ecclesia.
4174500	4177500	We, we say church, but it really means assembly.
4177500	4180700	And this, it's a, it's a broader term than just church.
4181020	4184780	These are groups of people, networks of people that are organized.
4184980	4187140	There's a reason why they were so successful.
4187500	4188500	They were organized.
4189340	4193940	And they say, he says that up until, I guess, in like maybe the second or
4193940	4198700	third century, if you, if you had a loved one died, you had to go through
4198700	4201780	the assemblies and they're most likely Christians.
4201820	4203020	That's how they got their power.
4203340	4209700	They took, they infiltrated the, the, the, um, what do you call it?
4209820	4213900	When someone dies, uh, funeral home places, they were, they were the ones that
4213900	4215300	infiltrated and took those over.
4216140	4216740	You know what I mean?
4217100	4220780	But it kind of reminds me of like today where you see these funeral homes and
4220780	4224740	they got Italian names and it's like, maybe it's a mafia in front of it.
4224740	4226220	Like, like it's just like a front.
4226260	4226740	You know what I mean?
4227020	4227620	Who knows?
4227980	4228980	Throwing ideas out there.
4229260	4232940	No, it makes me wonder what makes me, I'm seriously thinking that though.
4232980	4234020	I'm not, I'm not getting around.
4234380	4239660	It makes you wonder how much cash was flowing back to those original
4239660	4244540	apostles and particularly Peter, because he's named as the keeper of the keys.
4244540	4244820	Right?
4244820	4245940	Like that's another thing.
4246220	4252260	Why is this gangster, uh, Magus, uh, involved with children and prostitutes
4252580	4254180	and tax collectors?
4254540	4262900	Why does he walk around in that, um, in that state saying, Hey, Peter, rock,
4263660	4265620	um, I'll give you the keys.
4265780	4266900	What, what is that?
4267500	4269140	What the, what does that mean?
4269140	4269380	Right?
4269380	4274140	We, we look through the, through the fairytale and we think, Oh,
4275140	4276460	I'll give you the keys, right?
4276460	4279460	What the, no, no, what's he, what did he mean when he's going to give him the
4279460	4280900	keys somehow he did?
4281260	4284220	Cause Peter ends up making a ton of money off the deal.
4285940	4292780	He got it, it got to the point where the church of Rome is claiming that they
4292780	4296460	came from like, this is Peter's thing, right?
4296820	4303260	Like that's, it's the point that he don't, he's put up as like the successor
4303300	4308260	almost, if you will, like the book of X starts off before you even get to Paul.
4308780	4310660	Peter's the one reviving dead people.
4310700	4313500	He's the one who's Peter resurrects a dead person in the book.
4314700	4315340	Forget about that.
4315340	4317100	It's not just Jesus resurrecting dead.
4317540	4318540	It's also Peter.
4318540	4319740	And then Paul does it too.
4320220	4320620	Yeah.
4320820	4326340	And he's battling, he's battling that Simon Magus who wants the piece of the
4326340	4328020	action, he wants any action.
4328020	4331380	And Peter's like, no, cut him out, cut him out.
4331380	4331660	Right.
4331660	4334260	He was a good, he was a good thug, man.
4334660	4337820	The Simonians were like another rival gang, if you will.
4338860	4341860	And so the, the, the history gets written by the victors.
4342340	4347580	The Simonians end up getting written in this, the text where Peter and Simon,
4347940	4350460	Simon, Magus, they have a show off.
4350900	4351820	They have a showdown.
4352540	4357700	It's like a, like a, like a Western gun, like a, you know, bit Billy Barton.
4358140	4361020	And, and what's his name and badass Billy Joe.
4361020	4364300	And they're having their little, they got their guns pointed at each other.
4364300	4365540	And Peter wins.
4365540	4367620	Peter shoots him down, dead, done.
4367940	4368700	And that's what happens.
4369020	4371900	It says in the text that Simon Magus, this is not an act.
4371900	4376060	This is an apocryphal text, but it says in the apocryphal text that Simon Magus
4376060	4377900	goes, let's see what you got, bro.
4378220	4381060	And he starts flying in the air and he's just flying.
4381060	4382420	Like, look how powerful I am.
4382420	4383580	Look how much power I got.
4383900	4388780	And Peter goes, really dog, really dog, boop, and makes them fall down dead.
4389180	4390580	And then Peter wins, dude.
4390660	4393300	Like, Peter is more powerful than Simon Magus.
4393380	4395340	And it's like, that's the message that you get.
4396020	4399420	But you almost, it almost makes you wonder, what's behind this message?
4399420	4403620	Or was there, was there a warring factions of Christians in Rome?
4403620	4404420	I think so.
4404660	4406980	The archaeology sure as hell shows us this.
4407580	4410660	The, the evidence shows us this, that there was more than one Christian group
4410660	4415140	going on in Rome, Simonians read Irenaeus and, and Hippolytus.
4415380	4419540	They're talking about the Simonians being all over Rome, worshiping Simon Magus
4419580	4420540	as a Christ.
4420820	4422460	Simon Magus was the Christ.
4423660	4423940	Yeah.
4425340	4431460	He was offering, and he was offering that female avenue as well, that you get
4431460	4434380	through the or through the Ophites.
4434820	4439340	You remember in selling his wife, Helen, and entering her into this, all the
4439340	4443540	stuff that the Nicolations were doing with their, brought with their wives.
4444100	4449380	Now, if this ecclesia, if this thing that, you know, we say church and we think
4449380	4456060	fairy tale, huh, and no, if this assembly that starts out is able to, you're able
4456060	4461980	to have others crop up, other unions crop up in other places that are, have the
4461980	4467300	same hierarchy and Paul, not as Paul, it's the same gangster stuff.
4467340	4472420	He's writing the church at Rome saying, Hey, thank you for the donations.
4472420	4472740	Right.
4472740	4475180	Thank you for, I understand that you're trying to help me.
4475500	4476900	This is what we're doing.
4476900	4477180	Right.
4477180	4479260	It's the, we will repay that gesture.
4479260	4479780	Don't worry.
4480300	4481260	Oh, the message.
4481300	4483100	We're, we're, everything's good over here.
4483460	4483940	Yeah.
4484460	4484980	Yeah.
4485100	4485820	That's what it is.
4486460	4486780	Hmm.
4487020	4491180	And he's so hyped up on drugs for those of you like Paul and I'm talking to all
4491180	4496100	the, all the people who just drool all over Paul, the apostle was, no, what an
4496100	4497580	intellect, what a great guy.
4497980	4499140	He's doing his thing.
4499380	4504660	He's so drugged that he gets bitten by an ass, but it doesn't hurt him.
4504700	4505460	Doesn't hurt him at all.
4505460	4509460	And he shakes it off like, eh, because he knows what that venom is like.
4509500	4509740	Right.
4509740	4512020	He knows it because he's been shoving it.
4512060	4518260	If he's, I recently, I've recently come to the conclusion that that part of the
4518260	4524220	text is trying to say something to the certain people who are initiated into
4524220	4529060	these serpent, serpent sex of Christianity, the Nazis, the old fights.
4529500	4531780	That that's like a, a nod to them.
4531940	4536740	And that passage of acts where it's like Paul got bit by the serpent, nothing
4536740	4537140	happened.
4537660	4541380	And the people, those old fights are reading this text like, oh, shit.
4541700	4542300	Yeah.
4542340	4543540	Yeah.
4543580	4544500	He's one of us.
4545380	4549700	That's why Jesus says, I'm shocked that Jesus says, you know, you can expose
4549700	4552260	yourself to this stuff and it's not going to hurt you.
4552260	4552460	Right.
4552460	4556420	He can show these things, right?
4556660	4557900	And people are never understand.
4557900	4559460	They think fairy tale.
4559740	4563780	They think, um, Charlton Heston playing Moses and Easter.
4564220	4564620	Right.
4565500	4570260	They don't, they don't think, uh, what's the reality going on, man?
4570260	4571300	Paul was juiced.
4571780	4574380	Paul was juiced and there was money involved.
4574380	4576660	And there's a woman, a Lydian woman.
4576700	4580140	I think her name is Lydia involved in the purple trade, right?
4580140	4584900	That stuff keeps coming up and keeps coming up and keeps coming up.
4584900	4589780	So these early Christians were not only gangsters, but they were into the drugs,
4589780	4590100	man.
4590420	4591580	I'm going to throw this one up.
4591620	4594940	This is one of the last ones we have, but I got a real quick cause I drank so
4594940	4599100	much tea that I got to take a piss or throw this up so you can read it.
4599100	4600020	And I'll be right back.
4600540	4600980	Okay.
4601380	4602140	I will read it.
4603060	4606940	And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth.
4606940	4611980	Again, this is just like Dionysus does and gathered the vine of the earth and
4611980	4615140	cast it in the great wine press of the wrath of God.
4615580	4619180	And for those of you who think that they were, um, the Jews were
4619420	4622460	grapes, they weren't, it was a Canaanite industry.
4623100	4627460	And the wine press was trodden without the city and blood came out of the wine
4627460	4633740	press, even unto the horses bridles, but a space of 1,600 furlocked.
4634060	4638900	Oh my God, this blood is the blood that he's bringing out of you and me.
4639300	4644100	Bra, when he comes back, this is the blood that he's going to produce.
4644500	4648780	He's going to put us in that press and he's going to squeeze out blood.
4649180	4656540	That is not, that is not the savior that you and I see in church, right?
4656540	4662260	If they had a giant painting of a dude that was forcing your head into a wine
4662260	4668180	press and squeezing out your guts and blood and one giant mess that was as
4668180	4670860	high as, that was as high as a horse's bridle.
4670860	4674860	How high is a horse's bridle comes up, can come up to your chest, you know,
4674860	4677660	if you ever stand next to a horse, right?
4678020	4684340	So, and it says in, in Apocalypse, it says there, his garments are stained with
4684340	4687180	blood, stained with blood bra.
4687420	4694420	That is a dude that you and I can get behind and say, this, this guy is going
4694420	4695980	to take us all the way.
4695980	4698020	This is what gang members look for.
4698380	4701740	They look for that strong leader to take us all the way.
4702340	4704620	You know, unfortunately, Peter, God is ending.
4704860	4707060	They caught up with him, which they always do.
4707100	4712900	Gang leaders always get screwed in the end because they inevitably run a
4712900	4715660	foul because they're organized crime.
4715980	4718900	They inevitably run a foul of the civic authorities.
4719300	4722460	Jesus did it with the Romans, got himself crucified.
4722780	4726020	Peter did it, got himself crucified, right?
4726060	4734740	It's, it's almost like that hope of Roman civilization was to preserve that ethos,
4734740	4739580	that, that understanding of that the law governs.
4740020	4744140	And when you have a group that are organized crime, when you have a group
4744140	4752580	that's functioning based on that black market, you can't, you can't look at
4752580	4756140	Jesus's image when he's sitting there with Mary and she brings out this
4756140	4760140	stuff that is so expensive, you could have given it to the poor and fed a
4760140	4761100	whole bunch of people.
4761100	4762460	Instead, she uses it on him.
4762820	4768940	My question is, what is their gang doing with those resources, right?
4768940	4772700	These are black market resources and they're using them.
4773340	4774180	They're using them.
4774180	4775820	Jesus is in it deep.
4776060	4780500	So when he's arrested with that kid in the public park at four in the morning,
4782060	4783780	maybe it's not so strange.
4783780	4785020	Is that part of the bling?
4785420	4786380	Is that part of the thing?
4786380	4787180	You're with that kid.
4787180	4789420	You're in the right, getting hyped up.
4789420	4794700	You're entering that mode and he thinks he, he's genuine thinking he's the
4794700	4796340	son of God, right?
4796380	4798700	He's very genuine in that, right?
4799900	4800420	Yeah.
4800420	4804220	So good for him for Dionysus and Thug life.
4804300	4804820	I love it.
4804820	4805180	Yeah.
4805780	4808460	He's the, he's the cronion son, the son of Kronos.
4808460	4811220	Like he's trying to, that's what he's going for.
4811220	4818700	He's going, he's trying to set up a, a mystery right out of the culture that he's
4818700	4820100	in, like, you know, that's what it's at.
4820100	4822260	That's what it very much seems like.
4823260	4824420	That was the last slide.
4824540	4827220	But before I even get to, there's some questions people want to ask about the
4827220	4830820	Greek, um, before I even ask that, I just want one more time.

4988260	4993060	I'll do my best to, uh, accommodate whatever I can stop scamming, man.
4993060	4994500	Thank you for the super chat.
4994500	4997380	Can you provide any insight into the meaning of the Greek word and the New
4997380	5002340	Testament, which translates English to demon also do any, it's a good question.
5003220	5010500	Cause you got the word daemon, which kind of just translates to God, but in the Christian
5010500	5018340	sense, it kind of becomes demon where it's like a bad God or like some sort of demonic spirit.
5019540	5024180	That's as best as I could do on answering that question, but, uh, I apologize that I'm
5024180	5029860	won't have to leave, but, uh, I really, you know, you know, some of the, I get people on,
5029860	5031780	they only have a certain amount of time to be here.
5031780	5032980	So I apologize for that.
5033620	5034660	Morrison prophecy.
