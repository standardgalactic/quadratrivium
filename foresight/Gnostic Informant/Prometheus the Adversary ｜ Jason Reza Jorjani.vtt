00:00.000 --> 00:06.920
Prometheus, with his axe, had slashed open the skull of Zeus, and Prometheus

00:06.920 --> 00:11.240
slices through it with an axe, which by the way is a symbol of cutting through

00:11.240 --> 00:17.440
fatalism, and Prometheus delivers Athena from out of the skull of Zeus, and who

00:17.440 --> 00:23.480
is she? She's the goddess of wisdom and war. The forgetfulness of Epimetheus, which

00:23.480 --> 00:29.040
is the flip side of the Prometheus, lines up being responsible for the fact

00:29.040 --> 00:36.680
that man lacks an essence, and therefore Prometheus enlists the aid of Athena.

00:36.680 --> 00:43.280
Prometheus is molding mankind. Athena puts a butterfly into the mind, usually it's

00:43.280 --> 00:47.120
into the head of humanity. The butterfly is the ultimate symbol of

00:47.120 --> 00:53.800
metamorphosis and transformation, so it's underlining the fact that there is no

00:53.800 --> 00:59.920
human nature. The point is Prometheus brought the gift of Technatoman so that

00:59.920 --> 01:06.280
we could determine our own destiny. Right now we are at the 11th hour, we're at a

01:06.280 --> 01:10.040
key turning point in the face of the technological singularity. Prometheus is

01:10.040 --> 01:14.640
a figure that represents the promise of technological science. It's more

01:14.640 --> 01:18.640
important than ever right now to positively reappropriate this myth and

01:19.000 --> 01:24.320
understand the power that it already has over us unconsciously. We need to take

01:24.320 --> 01:29.440
that unconscious power, that demonic power of the Prometheus archetype over

01:29.440 --> 01:34.120
our society, and transform it into something that's more self-conscious and

01:34.120 --> 01:39.400
that can be directed in a positive manner. Pashetan means the adversary, and so

01:39.400 --> 01:44.080
is he the adversary? Hell yeah, he's the adversary. Prometheus is the original

01:44.080 --> 01:45.080
adversary.

01:48.640 --> 01:59.800
Welcome back to the Gnostic Informant, and you are about to attain true gnosis.

01:59.800 --> 02:07.320
Today, returning is one of the highly demanded scholars. Dr. Jason Rezegiorgiani,

02:07.320 --> 02:15.480
author of Prometheism, lovers of Sophia, Iranian Leviathan. Prometheus and Atlas,

02:16.040 --> 02:21.320
and a ton of more books, but today, we get the pleasure of talking about Prometheus,

02:22.200 --> 02:29.000
one of the more fascinating characters in mythology. Who is he? What is his story?

02:29.720 --> 02:33.000
We have fragments, we have different writers like Askelos who talks about some of the

02:33.000 --> 02:38.200
stuff that happens in his in his myth, but let's put it all together in one spot.

02:38.840 --> 02:44.600
So Dr. Rezegiorgiani, first of all, welcome to Gnostic Informant again. I'm glad I had you back on.

02:44.680 --> 02:50.600
Let's talk about Prometheus and what exactly is, if we put together his myth into one coherent story,

02:50.600 --> 02:56.280
what is it? So Neil, first of all, great to be back on. Always a pleasure.

02:57.800 --> 03:06.280
The thing about the myth of Prometheus is that it isn't nearly as widely known as it ought to be.

03:07.240 --> 03:11.960
To the point where you have to wonder, and after all, this is a Gnostic-oriented program,

03:11.960 --> 03:15.480
you have to wonder whether there hasn't been some kind of archontic suppression,

03:16.360 --> 03:24.920
because, you know, many Greek myths are the subject of countless children's books and film

03:24.920 --> 03:31.720
adaptations, right, even Hollywood films and so on and so forth, but here we're dealing with a myth

03:32.440 --> 03:39.880
that spans from the War of the Gods and the Titans to the creation of mankind

03:40.120 --> 03:49.400
to the great flood that destroyed a worldwide human civilization, right? I mean, the myth of Prometheus

03:49.400 --> 03:59.880
is unparalleled in terms of its monumental scope, addressing all of the key turning points of, you

03:59.880 --> 04:08.200
know, the creation, evolution, and a potential past destruction of mankind. So why is this myth

04:08.200 --> 04:17.880
as obscure as it is? I think it's because the essence of this myth is a call to rebellion and

04:17.880 --> 04:25.000
self-determination that's extremely threatening to any reigning establishment, and so in the

04:25.000 --> 04:30.600
classical world this myth was already being suppressed because it was a threat to, you know,

04:30.600 --> 04:37.080
the Olympian world order of that time, and then as this myth transformed and we'll discuss this

04:37.080 --> 04:43.480
into a Luciferian form after the advent of Christianity, particularly, you know,

04:44.680 --> 04:50.520
from the Middle Ages through the Renaissance into the early modern period when Prometheus

04:50.520 --> 04:55.960
is rediscovered and reappropriated by particularly romantic authors like Byron and Shelley and

04:55.960 --> 05:01.800
Goethe and so forth. Prometheus yet again became a symbol of insurrection and human

05:01.800 --> 05:08.200
self-determination that was threatening both to the church and to the state, and so this is why I

05:08.200 --> 05:16.520
think that, you know, it's been rendered far more obscure than it ought to be, and so let's unpack,

05:16.520 --> 05:24.120
you know, the core symbols and main twists and turns of this very powerful, I was about to say

05:24.120 --> 05:29.320
epic, but really what it is is a tragedy, and in fact as we'll get into it, Prometheus is the first

05:29.320 --> 05:36.200
known tragedy in the recorded history of human literature. Wow, that's fascinating.

05:39.080 --> 05:44.440
So where should we start? Should we start maybe with the sources? Just a review of...

05:44.440 --> 05:49.240
Because I know you got in Hesiod, you have a lot of Prometheus stuff happening with,

05:49.240 --> 05:55.240
you mentioned Ducalion and the flood, Prometheus sort of plays this role, and I almost wonder if

05:55.240 --> 06:01.480
there's an older proto-Indo-European myth that predates the Sumerians and this myth because

06:01.480 --> 06:06.440
he looks like he's playing the same role Anki's playing in Sumeria, where he tells, well Anki

06:06.440 --> 06:11.800
tells what a Gilgamesh or whoever, hey build a flood because Anu's going to flood everybody out,

06:11.800 --> 06:15.800
but in the Hesiod myth he's like, it's just Zeus doing that, it's the same thing,

06:16.920 --> 06:21.640
and then you have Oscalus, but I'm jumping ahead now, but yeah, let's get to the sources, sure.

06:22.600 --> 06:30.760
So there most certainly is both an Indo-European predecessor or prototype for this myth

06:31.320 --> 06:36.440
and also a Sumerian one, and actually since you went there, let me just run with that,

06:37.080 --> 06:43.560
that basically the myth of Prometheus in its Greek form appears to be a synthesis

06:44.360 --> 06:53.560
of the myth of Anki with the story of a figure called Amirani, and so let me start with the lesser

06:53.560 --> 07:03.960
known one, Amirani is a fire-bringing titan that was worshiped by the Schizian branch of the Iranian

07:03.960 --> 07:12.120
peoples who lived in the Caucasus. Now of course, you know, if anyone knows even the

07:12.120 --> 07:15.640
littlest bit about the myth of Prometheus, they know that Prometheus was bound in the Caucasus

07:15.640 --> 07:21.880
by Zeus, this is where, you know, it's the site where he's punished, tortured for having been

07:21.880 --> 07:31.160
the benefactor of mankind. So in the Caucasus Mountains, there was actually this cult of Amirani,

07:32.040 --> 07:39.560
and you had the Schizians worshipping a titan who waged war against the gods

07:40.200 --> 07:49.400
and who brought fire to mankind and taught humans metallurgy, including how to forge weapons,

07:49.400 --> 07:56.680
and you often see imagery of Amirani in particularly what's present day Georgia,

07:56.680 --> 08:04.360
which used to be, you know, a Schizian-Iranian territory, and in fact the last remnant of

08:04.360 --> 08:11.400
the Schizian people, the Ossetians, still live in Georgia today. And so in that area of Georgia and

08:11.400 --> 08:18.600
Ossetia, this, you know, stronghold of the Iranians in the Caucasus, you see this imagery of Amirani

08:18.600 --> 08:25.480
holding a torch in one hand and a sword in the other, you know, symbolizing the fact that this

08:25.480 --> 08:30.920
fire that he stole from the heavens and brought to humanity was used as a fire of the forge,

08:31.800 --> 08:37.640
including in order to empower humanity to basically declare its independence from tyrannical and

08:37.640 --> 08:47.400
unjust gods. So this Amirani figure also winds up being chained and attacked by the eagle of the

08:48.360 --> 08:54.600
tyrannical lord that he leads humanity in a rebellion against. And we'll come to this later

08:54.680 --> 09:01.720
as part of, you know, the various episodes in the myth of Prometheus, but ultimately Hercules,

09:01.720 --> 09:11.560
or the Greek Heracles, frees Prometheus from, you know, his torture being chained to this rock,

09:11.560 --> 09:18.440
and he does so by shooting the eagle of Zeus through with arrows. And this is part of the

09:18.440 --> 09:25.240
Amirani myth that there is this figure who the Greeks called the Schythian Hercules and who the

09:25.240 --> 09:35.720
Ossetians refer to as Batras and who the Eastern Schythians called Rostam, Rostame Saxi, Rostam

09:35.720 --> 09:43.160
the Schythian born, who becomes the epic hero of the Persian national epic, the Shahnameh.

09:44.040 --> 09:50.680
And so this figure in the Amirani myth is the one who comes and frees Amirani by shooting this eagle

09:50.680 --> 09:57.720
through with arrows. And this was such a widely disseminated and deeply entrenched element of

09:58.360 --> 10:04.200
Schythian folklore that the people in Ossetia to this day still have a tradition of destroying

10:04.200 --> 10:11.000
eagle's nests when they find them as a reverence of, you know, a memorialization of

10:13.080 --> 10:18.680
the freeing of Amirani. So clearly there are these elements of the Prometheus myth there.

10:20.120 --> 10:28.200
And it also is worth mentioning in that regard that the Parthian dynasty of Iran

10:29.160 --> 10:35.800
were descended from Schythians. They adopted the Persian, you know, imperial culture and the

10:35.800 --> 10:40.520
legacy of the Achaemenid Persians, but they were not Persians, they were descended from Schythians.

10:41.160 --> 10:45.160
So they were more nomadic barbarian people who then came and took over the seat of the empire

10:45.160 --> 10:49.720
and created the second empire of Iran, the Parthian empire, which was the great rival of classical Rome.

10:50.600 --> 10:56.760
And these Parthians had a myth that was so important to them that it was the basis for the

10:56.760 --> 11:05.080
iconography on their coins. These Parthians had a myth that Perseus stole fire from the heavens

11:05.960 --> 11:14.200
and brought it to mankind and established the order of the Magi in order to be the guardians

11:14.200 --> 11:21.800
of the eternal flame on the earth. And according to this myth, Perseus, the son of Perseus,

11:21.800 --> 11:27.320
was the patriarch of the Persian people. Now, this is interesting because

11:29.240 --> 11:37.080
in the iconography of Perseus slaying Medusa, Perseus is looking away from the head of the

11:37.080 --> 11:46.520
Gorgon as he severs it. And it's been noted by art historians that the iconography of the bull slaying

11:46.520 --> 11:53.240
in Mithraism has this same posture, and you don't find it anywhere else in classical art.

11:53.240 --> 12:01.320
Mithras is looking away from the head of the bull as he slits its throat. And in Mithraism,

12:02.280 --> 12:11.080
Mithra is portrayed as going to battle against Zorvan, who is basically Kronos, the Lord of Time.

12:11.800 --> 12:18.680
And this becomes very significant to the myth of Prometheus. So Mithra overpowers Zorvan,

12:18.680 --> 12:27.080
and Zorvan was depicted as a Gorgon. So the Medusa imagery in the myth of Perseus is like

12:27.080 --> 12:36.600
a later reiteration of this archaic-mythraic idea of Mithra, namely what becomes later Perseus,

12:36.600 --> 12:45.240
slaying the Gorgonic Lord of Time and appropriating its power in the form of the severed head,

12:45.240 --> 12:51.800
but looking away from it at the same time. And this same figure steals fire from the heavens,

12:51.800 --> 12:56.520
brings it down to earth. His son is the patriarch of the Persians, and he creates the order of the

12:56.520 --> 13:04.280
Magi, namely the priests of Zarathustra's religion, to be the guardians of the fire. And

13:04.520 --> 13:10.360
there are a lot of elements of the teaching of Zarathustra, like the use of the term Titan of

13:10.360 --> 13:17.000
Wisdom to refer to Aura Mazda, the main symbol of the religion being the eternal fire,

13:17.000 --> 13:22.120
the main quality of Aura Mazda being forethought, which is a synonym of Promethea,

13:22.680 --> 13:26.840
the root of the name of Prometheus, forethought, or thinking ahead, or the progressive

13:26.840 --> 13:34.440
mentality, the forward-oriented mind. And so you can see that there's this older

13:34.440 --> 13:41.480
Indo-European, particularly Iranian, matrix of the Prometheus myth coming from out of the Caucasus,

13:43.080 --> 13:46.760
which is a general region of Zarathustra as well. He was a little bit further to the south

13:46.760 --> 13:54.360
and around Lake Urumye in Iranian Azerbaijan, but same general region around the Caspian Sea.

13:54.920 --> 14:03.720
And it looks like what happened is this myth fused with the myth of Angie. And how did that happen?

14:03.720 --> 14:10.760
Well, the Persian Empire emanating from out of Persia, from out of the territory right above

14:10.760 --> 14:18.920
the Persian Gulf, took both Mesopotamia, and then of course the Iranians were native

14:18.920 --> 14:24.280
inhabitants of the Caucasus, so the Persian Empire connected the territory where the Sumerian

14:24.280 --> 14:29.640
myths were prevalent, with the territory where you had the myth of Amirani in the Caucasus.

14:29.640 --> 14:36.680
And these two somehow fused so that by the time Hesiod is living in Anatolia, which again is part

14:36.680 --> 14:44.040
of the Persian Empire, Hesiod was a citizen of Iran. Well, Hesiod's time actually was slightly

14:44.040 --> 14:50.280
before the Persian Empire, but the Medes were already very dominant going into southern Anatolia.

14:50.280 --> 14:53.400
And then the Medes and the Persians joined together to create this empire. In any case,

14:55.160 --> 15:04.840
the territory where Hesiod winds up basically functioning as this bard and laying this ground

15:04.840 --> 15:11.640
work for Greek folklore becomes a core part of the Persian Empire. And I think that these two

15:11.640 --> 15:16.120
myths fused there. So what's the other one, the myth of Angie, which is about how there's this

15:16.120 --> 15:22.920
conflict between two brothers among the Anunnaki. One of them wants to create mankind as a slave

15:22.920 --> 15:29.000
race to serve the various purposes of these gods who came down to earth from the heavens.

15:30.840 --> 15:37.880
And that's Elel, Elel or Enlil. And he's a storm god, basically Jehovah. And his psychological

15:37.880 --> 15:43.480
profile is more or less identical to that of Jehovah in the Old Testament, Yahweh.

15:43.480 --> 15:45.560
I think even El comes from that, right?

15:45.560 --> 15:47.800
El, exactly. Yeah, so El. Yeah.

15:49.800 --> 15:59.240
And then, yeah, and Elel, it's interesting, Elel, Allah, Allah, El, Allah, the Muslim thing

15:59.240 --> 16:04.360
is no god but El. You could think about, they translated these days, they love to say there's

16:04.360 --> 16:10.680
no god but God, as if it's some universalistic statement. You have this abstract monotheistic

16:10.680 --> 16:16.840
theology. But really, in a way, you could read that as saying there's no god but El, namely Elel.

16:16.840 --> 16:21.480
And the letter, and the out of the Semitic olive, whether it's Arabic or Hebrew or whatever,

16:21.480 --> 16:29.400
that's the El, that's the letter you use for El. It's not hell, because you use a hat for the

16:29.400 --> 16:35.000
letter E. So people don't realize that it really is El, not El, but they just pronounce El.

16:35.400 --> 16:43.480
Yes. It's all the evolution of the El cult. And this El bastard wanted to create us as a slave race,

16:45.000 --> 16:48.920
meant to just serve the purposes of the Anunnaki.

16:48.920 --> 16:55.720
Well, since we're on the subject, I noticed they try to polemicize this Titan mythology,

16:55.720 --> 16:59.240
because they make it look like these are fallen angels that are giving metal,

16:59.240 --> 17:05.240
algae, and fire to Enoch. And this is in the myth of Enoch, where you have Ezzel and

17:05.240 --> 17:10.760
Samael and all these different fallen demon angels or whatever they are. And they're falling in love

17:10.760 --> 17:15.080
with the women and they're teaching men how to use fire and teaching them how to use metals.

17:15.080 --> 17:18.360
And you're like, wait a minute, are they polemicizing the other myth? And that's probably what's going

17:18.360 --> 17:24.200
on. Absolutely. Now, I was going to wait to get to this, but look, it's just so this, we're in

17:24.200 --> 17:30.440
a better flow here. Let me just say it right now, that in the myth of Prometheus,

17:31.960 --> 17:38.040
it said that Prometheus didn't just bring fire, you know, didn't just steal fire from the workshop

17:38.040 --> 17:46.280
of Hephaestus on Mount Olympus and bring it as a gift to mankind. Prometheus taught humanity

17:47.240 --> 17:53.880
the various arts and sciences. Prometheus teacher in every art is how Escalus puts it.

17:54.600 --> 18:02.040
And so Prometheus, in that Greek version of the myth, is performing exactly the same function.

18:02.040 --> 18:09.320
Teacher in every art brought the fire as a means to mighty ends, Escalus says, mighty ends, like

18:09.320 --> 18:16.120
the way Amirani taught humanity how to use this fire to forge weapons among other things, among

18:16.120 --> 18:23.560
other metallurgical, you know, crafts, right. And so Prometheus is doing exactly what the

18:23.560 --> 18:31.800
fallen angels were supposedly doing in the book of Enoch. The book of Enoch was basically censored

18:31.800 --> 18:40.200
from the Old Testament. It survived more or less only in an Ethiopian form. And it explains what

18:40.920 --> 18:47.000
the hell happened in Genesis six, which is an absolutely, you know, it's an absurd part of the

18:47.000 --> 18:52.760
Bible, where in like, literally one paragraph, you're told that these angels came down and they

18:52.760 --> 18:58.840
had sex with, you know, mortal women, and there was this race of giants consequently sired on the

18:58.840 --> 19:04.120
earth, and they became rebellious against heaven. And God decides as a result of this to basically

19:04.120 --> 19:08.920
wipe out all of mankind in this global deluge. And you're left wondering, with this one paragraph,

19:09.000 --> 19:12.760
like, what the hell happened here? What could have happened that God has decided to wipe clean

19:12.760 --> 19:17.000
his whole creation, right? And by the way, what kind of God is this who didn't see this coming?

19:17.000 --> 19:25.960
Anyway, clearly not an omniscient God. So it's basically LL, or as we're going to see Zeus in

19:25.960 --> 19:35.960
the myth Prometheus. And so Prometheus does exactly what the fallen angels supposedly did,

19:35.960 --> 19:41.000
which you see in the book of Enoch, it expands on Genesis six at length and talks about how

19:41.000 --> 19:45.320
they came down and their purpose was to empower humanity. Then we're just coming down have sex

19:45.320 --> 19:51.000
with mortal women. They were having sex with mortal women to create a race of hybrids on the

19:51.000 --> 19:58.200
earth who would be able to contest, you know, the sovereignty of the gods would be able to lead a

19:58.200 --> 20:06.280
essentially liberation struggle against heaven and to storm heaven as it were. And so they teach

20:06.280 --> 20:11.960
humanity all the arts and sciences exactly what Prometheus did and exactly what Enki is supposed

20:11.960 --> 20:20.040
to have done. So Enki, Enki is the creator of mankind. Just like in the myth of Prometheus,

20:20.040 --> 20:26.600
it's not Zeus who creates humanity. Prometheus is the architect of humanity, the father of mankind.

20:26.600 --> 20:30.280
And he's a good father. He's the father who wants his children to flourish,

20:30.280 --> 20:35.480
and he beneficently attempts to empower them. He's the kind of father who wants to see his

20:35.480 --> 20:40.520
children do even better than him. And so he teaches humanity all these arts and sciences.

20:41.160 --> 20:49.800
Just like Enki sends seven sages to teach humanity all of the various crafts. And, you know,

20:49.880 --> 20:55.080
Ella was furious about this. And, you know, then it lays the groundwork ultimately for this global

20:55.080 --> 21:02.600
deluge to basically decimate the high civilization that develops on the basis of the arts and the

21:02.600 --> 21:09.400
sciences that were taught to humanity by the rebel and Enki, or as the Christians later call them,

21:09.400 --> 21:15.160
the fallen angels. And you see all of this in the myth of Prometheus. I mean, you know,

21:15.160 --> 21:22.440
so I'm really jumping ahead now, but and we can come back around to it in a sequential order.

21:23.000 --> 21:30.440
But basically, you know, people lose sight of the fact that the flood myth exists as part of the

21:30.440 --> 21:38.280
myth of Prometheus in Greek culture. Prometheus' son, Dukallion, is the Greek Noah figure.

21:38.440 --> 21:43.640
Right. Except that the Greek version makes a hell of a lot more sense.

21:43.640 --> 21:50.200
Right. Because why would the same God who's trying to wipe out humanity with a flood appoint

21:50.200 --> 21:59.000
someone to save humanity from the flood? It doesn't make any sense. This is a Yahwist appropriation

21:59.000 --> 22:05.240
of an older myth, which was threatening to that religious establishment, a myth wherein it's the

22:06.040 --> 22:15.240
son or a representative of the Enki figure, son of Prometheus, who attempts to save what he can

22:15.240 --> 22:22.120
of humanity from this global deluge. And so this is Dukallion and Dukallion is depicted very much

22:22.120 --> 22:28.680
in the guise of the sages that worked with Enki as a kind of civilizer. He not only saves a portion

22:28.680 --> 22:34.120
of humanity from this flood, he helps to reestablish civilization on the earth. So he's kind of like

22:35.640 --> 22:41.240
you could say the bricklayer of the Tower of Babel to put it in biblical terms. The one who, you

22:41.240 --> 22:47.560
know, makes another attempt after the flood to build a tower to the heavens to empower and

22:47.560 --> 22:55.240
unify humanity. So, yeah, so the myth of Dukallion connects Prometheus to the flood myth in the

22:55.240 --> 23:01.720
Bible and underlines the fact that Prometheus is essentially, to put it in biblical terms,

23:01.720 --> 23:10.440
the leader of the fallen angels. Figures that later winds up being called Lucifer. And well,

23:10.440 --> 23:16.120
what's Lucifer? The bringer of the light. Well, that's the fire that he brought from heaven. It's

23:16.120 --> 23:23.240
pretty obvious. Which is funny because in Lucifer's Roman mythology with Ovid and other writers,

23:23.240 --> 23:28.680
there's nothing evil about him. He's a hero. He's like, he's a savior god. There's nothing,

23:28.680 --> 23:32.840
he's not Satanic or whatever the hell the Christians try to say about him later on.

23:33.560 --> 23:38.520
Or Isaiah tries to say about him in his text. He's just, he's just a light bringer. He's the

23:38.520 --> 23:45.080
son of dawn. Yeah. Well, but the thing is, he is Satanic in the sense that the word Satan,

23:45.080 --> 23:52.600
shaitan, just means ha-shaitan in Hebrew or shaitan in Arabic. Ha-shaitan means the adversary.

23:52.600 --> 23:57.720
And so is he the adversary? Hell yeah, he's the adversary. Prometheus is the original

23:57.720 --> 24:03.320
adversary. Right? And, and there's something, and I want to come back to this flood myth. Okay,

24:03.320 --> 24:07.400
but let me just go on a tangent for a minute back to the very beginning, right? Because I want to

24:07.400 --> 24:14.600
highlight the way in which this character is radically adversarial. Prometheus betrays the

24:14.600 --> 24:22.840
Titans. He's an adversary first against his fellow Titans. So he's not a god. Prometheus is a Titan.

24:22.840 --> 24:30.280
And he turns on the Titans and sides with Zeus in the Titanomachia, in the clash of the Titans,

24:31.000 --> 24:37.240
because Prometheus goes to these fellow Titans. He's like, listen, you can't defeat these Olympians

24:37.240 --> 24:42.440
through brute force. I'm telling you, there's got to be strategy here. He lays out stratagems

24:43.000 --> 24:48.120
with his forethought and they won't have it. And so Prometheus takes the position that, well,

24:48.120 --> 24:52.360
you know, these Titans are going to lose. This is a lose. It's futile. They're going to lose.

24:52.840 --> 25:00.680
And so in order to basically put himself in a better position for achieving a more long-term

25:00.680 --> 25:06.040
objective, he shrewdly sides with the Olympians and helps Zeus come to power.

25:07.720 --> 25:14.360
Then he realizes in due course that, and let me just point a couple of things out before I continue

25:15.240 --> 25:24.120
down that road, that when this happens, Prometheus has three brothers and two of them wind up being

25:24.120 --> 25:29.720
punished by Zeus after he comes to power, after the Olympians win in the Titanomachia.

25:30.360 --> 25:36.360
Two of Prometheus's three brothers are punished together with the other Titans. And one of them

25:36.360 --> 25:44.760
is a figure called Minotius. Minotius was bound in Tartarus under the earth together with the other

25:44.760 --> 25:59.880
Titans. And he's the Titan of excessive wrath, prideful rage, and hubris. So you can see how

25:59.880 --> 26:05.800
this is a shadow side of Prometheus that later is integrated into the Judeo-Christian image

26:05.800 --> 26:12.440
of Satan. It's the side of Prometheus, the brother of Prometheus as it were, who is bound under the

26:12.440 --> 26:18.920
earth. In other words, what becomes later hell in the Judeo-Christian cosmology. He's that side of

26:18.920 --> 26:26.280
Prometheus that is bound in the pit of hell as it were and has this exceedingly wrathful,

26:26.280 --> 26:34.840
prideful defiance of Zeus from the beginning. And then the other brother of Prometheus,

26:34.840 --> 26:42.440
another brother of Prometheus, Atlas, is the strongest of the Titans and he led the Titans in

26:42.440 --> 26:48.600
the battle. He was the general who leads the Titans in the Titanomachia and he's punished

26:48.600 --> 26:54.840
by forcing him to separate heaven and earth through bearing the celestial sphere on his

26:54.840 --> 27:02.360
own shoulders, which is an incredibly powerful symbol. Because it means that he's not just

27:02.440 --> 27:08.440
separating heaven and earth, he's connecting heaven and earth. So heaven and earth are connected

27:08.440 --> 27:16.200
through Atlas and remember Atlas was against Zeus and so in a way he's sort of in this dynamic

27:16.200 --> 27:22.200
position where he could storm heaven from the earth because he's the one holding up the heavens.

27:22.200 --> 27:30.120
And then later Atlas becomes a metaphor for all kinds of basically maps of knowledge.

27:31.080 --> 27:35.400
Right, that's good. Atlas is in the sense of star charts which

27:36.040 --> 27:42.360
seafarers use to navigate the oceans. And so then map making was associated with Atlas,

27:42.360 --> 27:47.320
Atlas is of the world. And then even in medicine you have Atlas is of the human body,

27:47.320 --> 27:54.280
you know, the basically, you know, this portrayals of the skeletal system and the nervous system and

27:54.280 --> 27:59.400
so on. They're called medical Atlas. And so Atlas is a term that's very much associated with

28:00.280 --> 28:05.640
bodies of knowledge and mapping out the world for the sake of gaining greater knowledge.

28:05.640 --> 28:12.840
And so in this way Atlas is also intimately connected with the meaning of the myth of Prometheus

28:12.840 --> 28:18.680
and reflects another aspect of Prometheus' association with science and technology,

28:18.680 --> 28:22.360
which is of course that the light of the fire that he brings from Olympus,

28:23.240 --> 28:27.240
the light of the fire in the dark night of human ignorance, and also the fire of the

28:27.240 --> 28:31.560
forge that's a symbol of technological science. And so it's not incidental that Atlas is the

28:31.560 --> 28:36.360
brother of Prometheus, it's emphasizing the association of Prometheus with technological

28:36.360 --> 28:41.000
science and humanity's quest for knowledge and mapping out of the world through human

28:41.000 --> 28:49.480
initiative and exploration and the quest for discovery. And then the last brother of Prometheus

28:49.560 --> 28:57.800
is Epimetheus, who, he's the fool, he's the idiot, his name means afterthought.

28:57.800 --> 29:02.680
Instead of forethought Prometheus, it comes from Epimetheus, which is the opposite

29:02.680 --> 29:09.160
adjectival quality, meaning afterthought or hindsight, like, you know, like when you look

29:09.160 --> 29:14.200
back and say, shit, I shouldn't have done that, you know, that's Epimetheus, you know,

29:14.680 --> 29:22.920
hard-earned hindsight and realizing something only in retrospect. So Epimetheus, the other

29:22.920 --> 29:29.880
brother of Prometheus, is this forgetful fool, right, hindsight, we're talking about, you know,

29:29.880 --> 29:39.160
how his name means afterthought. And he sides with Prometheus, takes his advice that they should

29:39.160 --> 29:46.280
basically help Zeus come to power. And so he's rewarded by being allowed to help Prometheus

29:47.240 --> 29:54.600
in the creation of mankind, and in fact, in the creation of the animals in general. So Epimetheus

29:54.600 --> 30:02.440
functions as a kind of subcontractor who helps Prometheus as Prometheus is, you know, molding

30:02.440 --> 30:10.360
mankind from out of clay. And by the way, just on a side note, this whole issue of man being

30:10.360 --> 30:15.400
molded from out of clay, the race of man being molded from out of clay is significant because

30:17.640 --> 30:27.160
in the Semitic tradition that eventually yields Islam, it's said that before the race of clay,

30:27.880 --> 30:34.360
which, you know, is Adam, the race of Adam, which is not just a person, but a race, Adam

30:35.080 --> 30:43.320
is a mankind made of clay. And according to the Semitic myths before Adam, there was a race made

30:43.320 --> 30:50.360
of fire on the earth. And so it appeared, and of course fire is the element associated with Prometheus.

30:51.240 --> 30:55.480
And this race of fire rebelled against the angels, against the

31:00.120 --> 31:09.000
Malayech, you know, the angels, and against El, against Allah. And they're punished. So it appears

31:09.000 --> 31:13.560
and their civilization is wiped off the face of the earth. So it appears that yet again,

31:13.560 --> 31:18.680
there is this parallel from the Greek myth to, you know, some kind of Semitic version,

31:19.240 --> 31:25.720
where the satanic is associated with the race of fire. And then the race of man,

31:25.720 --> 31:31.960
the race of clay is seen as being subsequent to that. And so the myth of Prometheus is extremely

31:31.960 --> 31:37.400
subversive in an Islamic context, because it's suggesting that actually the race of clay wasn't

31:37.400 --> 31:42.520
created by Allah, the way it says in the Quran, the race of clay was created by one of these

31:42.520 --> 31:48.680
beings of fire, who was a rebel against Allah. Right. And again, another myth that's been

31:49.240 --> 31:56.120
reappropriated, misappropriated by Yahwists, or if we want to put it in Islamic terminology,

31:56.120 --> 32:03.480
you know, Muslims, right, submitters, as the name suggests. So okay, what we were talking about was

32:04.280 --> 32:09.960
the nature of Prometheus as a primordial adversary. So what does this character do this,

32:09.960 --> 32:18.520
this Epimetheus, he's helping Prometheus create man. And he gives fur to certain animals and

32:18.520 --> 32:23.240
claws to other animals to be able to fend for themselves. And he gives sharp teeth to certain

32:23.240 --> 32:29.000
other creatures so that they can hunt their food, you know, with their mouths, and basically give

32:29.000 --> 32:35.720
some kind of survival advantage to every creature. But then when it comes to man, Epimetheus forgives,

32:35.720 --> 32:40.680
forgets to give man any essential quality that would be able to

32:43.560 --> 32:50.440
afford him, you know, a survival, a survival advantage that would be able to,

32:50.440 --> 32:58.280
you know, secure his existence on the earth. And so man is left lacking an essence. This is

32:58.280 --> 33:05.320
extremely important. The forgetfulness of Epimetheus, which is the flip side of the

33:05.320 --> 33:12.360
Promethea of Prometheus, winds up being responsible for the fact that man lacks an essence.

33:14.120 --> 33:17.560
And therefore Prometheus enlists the aid of Athena,

33:18.120 --> 33:28.360
humanity with its soul in the form of a butterfly. So Athena appears in the myth of Prometheus at

33:28.360 --> 33:34.520
this point. And there are many images of this, there are reliefs of it, it appears on some

33:36.840 --> 33:45.880
seals, it's on some vases and other, you know, Greek pottery. This image of Athena coming in

33:45.880 --> 33:52.360
as Prometheus is molding mankind. And there's Epimetheus to the side who forgets to endow

33:52.360 --> 33:58.760
man with any essence. And Athena puts a butterfly into the mind, usually it's into the head of

33:58.760 --> 34:09.240
humanity. Now why Athena? Why does Athena help? Because Prometheus had midwife Athena into existence.

34:09.240 --> 34:16.120
Prometheus with his axe had slashed open the skull of Zeus in a kind of, you know,

34:17.320 --> 34:24.520
play on a Caesarean section, had split open the close-knit Pekinos, mind of Zeus. It's an incredibly

34:24.520 --> 34:33.880
important image. So Zeus is often associated with fate. And so the Pekinos or close-knit mind of Zeus

34:33.880 --> 34:40.760
is the mesh of fate. And Prometheus slices through it with an axe, which by the way is a symbol of

34:40.760 --> 34:47.480
cutting through fatalism. And Prometheus delivers Athena from out of the skull of Zeus. And who

34:47.480 --> 34:54.520
is she? She's the goddess of wisdom and war. I was just gonna say something. Because in the

34:54.520 --> 35:02.920
Gnostic text, you had this understanding of Yahweh thinks he created humans, but really

35:03.000 --> 35:08.600
he was in it. He think somehow he had a dream or he thought he created Adam. But really it was Sophia

35:08.600 --> 35:14.520
wisdom that did it. And she looks at him like, you don't even know, I'm the one who did all this.

35:14.520 --> 35:19.560
And then, but what's even crazier is that the Gnostics who get called heretics for this,

35:20.200 --> 35:25.000
they're pointing to the Bible itself and saying, no, no, no, the book of Proverbs says that Sophia

35:25.000 --> 35:31.240
was there from the beginning. The wisdom of Solomon says Sophia created the first father.

35:31.720 --> 35:37.560
So like this is accurate as far as the scriptures say, not just making this stuff up. And then it

35:37.560 --> 35:43.080
lines up with what you're saying, Athena being Sophia as well, and then the titan of wisdom,

35:43.720 --> 35:49.720
creating mankind. So even the even the Yahwes have some of their own sources, right, putting this

35:49.720 --> 35:55.400
stuff in there and sort of snitching on themselves. Absolutely, absolutely. So that you have the

35:55.400 --> 36:02.760
prototype for the Sophianic figure. And in Athena, who is the goddess of wisdom and war, why wisdom

36:02.760 --> 36:13.320
and war? Because you cannot gain wisdom without going to war. Because Zeus wants us ignorant.

36:14.120 --> 36:19.160
The Olympians don't want us to be wise. They are the prototype for what later become the Gnostic

36:19.160 --> 36:26.840
Archons. And so to seek wisdom is to be prepared to go to war against the gods. That's why Athena is

36:26.840 --> 36:33.240
the goddess of wisdom and war inextricably. Okay. And so this is also the message of the

36:34.920 --> 36:40.600
Bhagavad Gita, where where where where where Christian is telling Arjun, you have to go to

36:40.600 --> 36:45.320
war. There's no, no, you have to make an action right now. You cannot just sit by and let your

36:45.320 --> 36:49.960
uncle do his thing. You have to fight your uncle. That's a that's a deep thing right there.

36:50.680 --> 36:57.160
In a Greek context, it winds up being epitomized by Heraclitus in the fragments of Heraclitus,

36:58.440 --> 37:04.680
who by the way, I mean, next to Pythagoras is the first philosopher in Greek history. Heraclitus

37:04.760 --> 37:14.360
says war is father and king of all. Some men, it shows or he he shows to be slaves. Others,

37:15.960 --> 37:23.640
he he reveals to be free men. All things come to pass and are ordained in accordance with conflict.

37:24.440 --> 37:31.960
Right. And so look, a wisdom and war. So why does Athena help Prometheus in this situation where

37:31.960 --> 37:36.120
man is left lacking in essence on accounts of the forgetfulness of Epimetheus? Well,

37:36.120 --> 37:42.120
because Prometheus was the midwife of Athena's birth. Right. Okay. And so Athena returns the

37:42.120 --> 37:48.120
favor by giving man his soul in the form of a butterfly. Now, does this, does this give man an

37:48.120 --> 37:54.360
essence? No, not really. And it's another fascinating symbol in this myth, because what's a butterfly?

37:54.360 --> 37:59.960
The butterfly is the ultimate symbol of metamorphosis and transformation. Wow. So it's

37:59.960 --> 38:06.600
underlining the fact that there is no human nature. There's no human nature.

38:08.040 --> 38:16.360
Human quote unquote, nature is to transform, to evolve, to become something else. We are beings

38:16.360 --> 38:21.320
of radical becoming. And then what's the other thing that Prometheus has to give

38:21.880 --> 38:29.160
man in order to basically give him a chance to fend for himself, because he doesn't have the

38:29.160 --> 38:33.800
claws that other animals do, where the, you know, large jaws and sharp teeth of other animals are

38:33.800 --> 38:41.640
fur, so as not to freeze in the winter, humanity, humanity is gifted fire as a tool of survival.

38:42.440 --> 38:48.760
Okay. So fire, which is the fire of the forge, which is the fountain head of all the crafts,

38:49.800 --> 38:57.800
and ultimately of technological science, is a remedy for the fact that we are lacking in essence.

38:57.800 --> 39:04.680
So what's this myth saying? I mean, why is it that Heidegger and Marx, who don't agree on,

39:04.680 --> 39:09.640
you know, all that, I mean, Marx is seen as the intellectual godfather of the left,

39:09.640 --> 39:15.080
and Heidegger was literally a Nazi. So, you know, there's some degree of divergence between

39:15.080 --> 39:22.120
Marx and Heidegger, but they both said Prometheus was the founder of philosophy that Prometheus is,

39:23.080 --> 39:30.440
not God, but divinity, that inaugurates philosophy, okay? His name affects that too,

39:30.440 --> 39:40.360
forethought. Yeah, but look, it's because why do Marx and Heidegger agree? Because Marx is all about

39:41.000 --> 39:51.160
how modern industrial capitalism is going to free humanity through a revolutionary,

39:52.360 --> 39:59.320
you know, dialectic, that modern industrial capitalism is going to be transformed

40:00.600 --> 40:08.840
in a way where the power of industry ultimately liberates mankind, and the industry is

40:08.840 --> 40:14.920
reappropriated by the workers, and they are no longer alienated from their labor,

40:14.920 --> 40:19.960
and they ultimately become sovereign and self-determined. And then Heidegger,

40:19.960 --> 40:26.920
the focus of his philosophical project, was how the trajectory of science, of abstract

40:26.920 --> 40:34.040
rational thought from Plato onward through Descartes ultimately culminates in modern technological

40:34.040 --> 40:42.760
science, and that, you know, we have to find some way to poetically reintegrate the transformative

40:42.760 --> 40:52.280
power of modern technological science. So, you know, ultimately what Heidegger saw in the myth

40:52.280 --> 41:03.240
of Prometheus has a lot to do with the fact that fire and the butterfly were the two remedies

41:03.960 --> 41:12.680
for mankind being lacking in an essence, in the sense that we, uniquely among all animals,

41:13.400 --> 41:23.080
define our own essence. Our existence precedes our essence, and the nature of our existence

41:23.560 --> 41:32.040
is to define our own essence through the power of technology, and to be the, basically,

41:33.560 --> 41:38.440
the stewards of our own evolution. So, we are these butterflies that go through a process of

41:38.440 --> 41:43.000
metamorphosis from the caterpillar through the chrysalis, right, to ultimately becoming this

41:44.360 --> 41:47.880
creature. It's kind of like what Nietzsche's getting at with the rope and the Superman thing.

41:48.680 --> 41:57.080
Exactly, exactly. It is the first version of that symbol or metaphor that ultimately becomes

41:57.080 --> 42:05.320
Nietzsche's tight rope between ape and overman. And I also noticed that all of the ancient Greek

42:05.320 --> 42:14.840
mysteries, all the great myths, basically, there's usually some sort of metamorphosis involved with

42:14.840 --> 42:21.240
the hero, with the savior, with the messiah, whoever it is, they all have some sort of apotheosis,

42:21.240 --> 42:27.720
metamorphosis, some sort of resurrection, something like that, which makes it a standard

42:28.760 --> 42:31.720
mysteries, I guess you would say, initiation cult or something like that.

42:33.160 --> 42:35.720
That's the common thread between all of them. You know what I mean?

42:36.680 --> 42:43.320
Sure, I do know what you mean, but the thing is that the Olympian world order is predicated

42:43.320 --> 42:48.680
on the stasis of humanity. And so to the extent that there are, you know, hero, by the way,

42:48.680 --> 42:54.440
originally, it means hybrid. It means hero means it comes from the word eros, and with

42:54.440 --> 43:00.600
reference to the eros or sex between gods and mortals. And so the original heroes were the

43:00.600 --> 43:07.720
people who were sired by the quote unquote fallen angels, right, and were more than mere humans,

43:08.360 --> 43:12.920
and who actually had a rebellious nature and defied the will of heaven, right.

43:12.920 --> 43:19.320
And so to the extent that you have these heroes engaging in developmental trajectories and

43:19.320 --> 43:23.800
they building up their character and persona and developing an ethos and becoming basically

43:23.800 --> 43:30.360
men in their own right, you have a defiance of what Olympus wants, which is us to basically

43:30.360 --> 43:40.120
remain servile, you know, and submit to submit. Yeah, and not and not undergo character building,

43:40.120 --> 43:45.000
right, which is going to give us enough psychological and ethical independence to

43:45.000 --> 43:51.800
determine our own course in the future. So anyway, you have at the core of this myth of the creation

43:51.800 --> 43:56.920
of mankind and emphasis of the fact that our existence precedes our essence and that through

43:56.920 --> 44:03.080
the power of technological science, we are going to undergo various metamorphoses that

44:03.080 --> 44:09.400
ultimately hold the potential for us to become as powerful or more powerful than the gods.

44:10.200 --> 44:18.680
And so this is, you know, another element of the the adversarial character of Prometheus,

44:18.680 --> 44:24.840
and then you see this continue in his next act of trickery. So Prometheus is not only a trickster

44:24.840 --> 44:30.600
because he steals fire from the workshop of the Festus and brings it as a gift to mankind.

44:30.600 --> 44:36.920
Prometheus is also a trickster because when Zeus comes around after the creation of humanity,

44:36.920 --> 44:43.080
not too happy with how humanity's been created and wanting to reduce humanity to servility,

44:43.880 --> 44:48.200
Zeus says to Prometheus, well, now that you created these things, which, you know, I'm not very happy

44:48.200 --> 44:52.600
with, you know, how you did this. I don't know about this butterfly business, right.

44:52.840 --> 45:00.040
But I want you to decide how they're going to sacrifice to me, right. How are these creatures

45:00.040 --> 45:07.960
going to be brought to their knees and, you know, basically worship and revere me. And so Prometheus

45:07.960 --> 45:15.880
devises this machination where he presents Zeus with two forms of sacrifice and asks

45:15.880 --> 45:22.040
him to choose between them. And in one of them, he's basically taken all of the nourishing,

45:22.040 --> 45:28.440
lean meat from an animal, from a sacrificed animal, and stuffed it into the stomach of an ox,

45:28.440 --> 45:36.840
which is very visually displeasing. And in the other bowl is the bones, the white bones of the

45:36.840 --> 45:45.320
sacrificed animal, but covered with a veneer of marbled fat. And Zeus picks the marbled fat,

45:46.040 --> 45:53.000
not realizing that it's all bones underneath. And this means that man gets to keep the nourishing

45:53.000 --> 45:59.080
part of the sacrificed animal and is basically giving nothing of importance to Olympus. So this

45:59.080 --> 46:04.520
is another way in which we see that Prometheus does not want his children to be, you know,

46:04.520 --> 46:11.640
a servile race revering some gods above themselves. Prometheus is trying to, you know, basically

46:12.040 --> 46:23.240
ensure that the nourishing part of the sacrifice remains the allotment of human beings.

46:23.240 --> 46:30.040
Right. And this is another act of trickery that he engages in, which by the way portrays Zeus as a

46:30.040 --> 46:35.560
fool. Because I mean, how do you, what kind of God you don't realize like he's pulling a fast one

46:35.560 --> 46:41.560
on you like this? And he see it tries to cover this up. And he see it when he writes the Theogony,

46:42.200 --> 46:47.560
in particular, he right, he mentions the myth of Prometheus in both of his major works in works and

46:47.560 --> 46:54.360
days, right, and in Theogony. And it's interesting that when you read works and days, Prometheus has

46:54.360 --> 47:04.360
a little bit more autonomy. And his defiance of Zeus is a little bolder. But then when he writes

47:04.360 --> 47:11.800
Theogony, he see it is really trying to come up with a canon of Olympian religion, right, right.

47:11.800 --> 47:23.560
This he see a character is an epitome of Greek traditionalism, patriarchy, conservatism, misogyny,

47:23.560 --> 47:30.040
he hates women. Okay. And so when he writes Theogony, he says absurd things like, Oh, well,

47:30.040 --> 47:36.520
you know, Zeus knew that Prometheus was trying to pull a fast one on him. And he just, you know,

47:36.520 --> 47:46.280
picked the the bowl of bones covered with the fat to like lure Prometheus into committing

47:46.280 --> 47:53.640
some sin of defiance or something. He's making justifications to whitewash the vulnerabilities

47:53.640 --> 48:02.440
of Zeus, because he's helping to build a cult of total obedience to Olympus. But then later,

48:02.440 --> 48:07.560
you have Escalus about 50, 50, 60 years later, or something, somewhere around there, the next

48:07.560 --> 48:15.560
century, he he see it is in the 600s BC, Escalus is in the 500s BC. By the time Escalus turns

48:15.560 --> 48:29.080
Prometheus into the first figure of Greek tragedy, you see the more humanist and rebellious elements

48:29.080 --> 48:35.640
of the myth, yeah, you know, basically restored to what was probably their original form.

48:35.640 --> 48:40.600
And I noticed in that in this particular version, with Escalus, I want to ask this,

48:40.600 --> 48:44.360
Escalus is very fascinating. Because I know he's initiated in all these mysteries,

48:44.360 --> 48:48.520
he gets in trouble, he almost gets killed for spilling the beans of what these mysteries are.

48:48.520 --> 48:54.200
Well, anyways, before we even get to that, I noticed that in that text, he really has this

48:54.200 --> 49:00.200
long dialogue between Hermes, who is sort of a tempter. He's the mouth word, he's the logos of

49:00.200 --> 49:06.360
Zeus. He's the word, he's the, he's the messenger of Zeus, basically. Zeus is won't see him. He's

49:06.360 --> 49:11.080
like, why can't Zeus come himself? And I noticed that Prometheus is like antagonizing him,

49:11.080 --> 49:15.720
and Hermes is tempting him, oh, we'll let you go, just, you know, just bend the knee, just bend the

49:15.720 --> 49:21.640
knee. And Prometheus refuses to cave into the tempter. What is this about?

49:23.240 --> 49:29.880
He's the angel Gabriel. Oh, that's awesome. Hermes is who later becomes Jibril, you know,

49:29.880 --> 49:35.560
or the angel Gabriel. That makes a lot of sense. Brings the Quran to Muhammad, you know, and so on

49:35.560 --> 49:46.200
and so forth. And so this, this messenger of God, the announcer comes and basically, or

49:46.200 --> 49:57.320
Poth, you know, comes and basically, he tries to, okay, he's not just tempting Prometheus,

49:57.320 --> 50:04.120
he's trying to torture a secret from out of them, because when Prometheus is bound by Zeus,

50:04.120 --> 50:10.200
it's not just a punishment, it is a torture that's intended to break Prometheus so that

50:10.200 --> 50:17.080
he reveals the secret of who is going to overthrow Zeus. Prometheus, with his forethought, and by the

50:17.080 --> 50:24.520
way, the mother of Prometheus is famous, not to be confused with Thadus, who we're going to talk

50:24.520 --> 50:34.600
about momentarily, but famous, the tightness is the mother of Prometheus, and she was the creator

50:34.600 --> 50:41.400
of the Oracle of Delphi, which she later gives to Apollo. So the prophetic power that's associated

50:41.400 --> 50:49.880
with the Oracle of Delphi is also somehow implicit in the myth of Prometheus, because famous, the

50:49.880 --> 50:56.120
creator of the Oracle of Delphi is the mother of Prometheus. So anyway, Prometheus, with his

50:56.120 --> 51:01.480
prophetic power and his forethought, the kind of forethought and projection that also becomes

51:01.480 --> 51:05.960
instrumental to technological science, right? Technological science is all about projection.

51:06.760 --> 51:11.320
And so Prometheus, with his power of projection, his forethought and his prophecy,

51:11.880 --> 51:21.640
knows who is going to eventually overthrow Zeus. And it turns out that it is the soul

51:22.360 --> 51:32.600
who later winds up being born as Achilles. And what Prometheus knows is that Zeus is going to rape

51:32.600 --> 51:38.360
famous, you know, Zeus is a serial rapist. He just turns into all these various animals and goes down

51:38.360 --> 51:47.000
and basically rapes these women, these poor women. And Prometheus knows that one of these women is

51:47.000 --> 51:53.880
going to be famous. And so Achilles is going to be born as a proper hero, a hero in the old sense

51:53.880 --> 52:00.680
of a hybrid. He's going to be a demigod. And this demigod version of Achilles is going to lead

52:00.680 --> 52:06.680
humanity into rebellion and overthrow Zeus and be a new sovereign over humanity and much more

52:06.680 --> 52:15.240
beneficent, much more humanitarian ruler from the throne of Olympus. And later what winds up

52:15.240 --> 52:21.640
happening is that actually Zeus finds out that this is going to happen. And so

52:24.200 --> 52:30.680
Zeus has, or Zeus basically pulls back and lets famous be married to Peleus,

52:30.680 --> 52:35.480
who becomes the human mortal father of Achilles. And then we have the whole story of Achilles and

52:35.480 --> 52:43.240
the Iliad. But this Achilles was supposed to be born as a demigod and Prometheus knows this

52:43.240 --> 52:53.240
and he wants to torture this out of Prometheus. And so he keeps sending Hermes. He keeps sending

52:53.240 --> 53:01.240
Hermes to try to convince Prometheus to give up this secret. While we're on this though, let me

53:01.240 --> 53:06.600
point out why is it significant that it's Achilles? And by the way, I discussed this at length in

53:06.600 --> 53:12.440
Prometheus and Atlas. The devil's really in the details here and I go into the Iliad and its

53:12.440 --> 53:18.200
connection to this part of the myth of Prometheus in my chapter on Prometheus in Prometheus and

53:18.200 --> 53:26.920
Atlas. If you look at the character of Achilles and the Iliad, his conflict with Agamemnon

53:27.720 --> 53:37.320
and the defiant stance that he takes amidst the Trojan War shows you the first figure in Greek

53:37.320 --> 53:47.960
literature who is questioning the social order. In Archaic Greece, there was no conceptual distinction

53:47.960 --> 53:56.360
between social order and nature. Nature was framed as a concept by the early philosophers.

53:57.480 --> 54:04.760
Who are writing about 150 years at least after the Iliad, at least. In the time of the Iliad,

54:04.760 --> 54:08.600
in the time of quote unquote Homer, whether there was actually a Homer who wrote this or

54:08.600 --> 54:12.920
whether he was a Bard who later recited it, whatever. In the time of quote unquote Homer,

54:14.280 --> 54:20.520
there was no conceptual distinction yet between nature and the nature of things in society. It

54:20.520 --> 54:26.680
was believed that customs were God given the way that, you know, the seasons are God given.

54:27.240 --> 54:33.560
The way that the habits of animals are God given, social institutions are just the way things are

54:33.560 --> 54:37.640
and they can't be questioned anymore than, you know, the way the birds and the bees live on.

54:38.280 --> 54:46.840
Right? It's all just the way things inevitably have to be. Right. And so when you see Achilles

54:46.840 --> 54:53.560
in the Iliad basically call bullshit on Agamemnon and confront him as an unjust tyrannical ruler

54:53.560 --> 55:00.440
and a bad commander and stand up for himself pridefully, some would say with hubris, the kind

55:00.440 --> 55:06.920
of hubris that we see from Prometheus ultimately. Right. You are seeing the first questioning of

55:06.920 --> 55:14.520
the social order and implicit framing of the concept of justice. Wow. As opposed to the way

55:14.520 --> 55:21.080
things just are. So Achilles is saying, sorry, fuck that. Things shouldn't be this way.

55:22.040 --> 55:28.360
They should be some other way. Right. And this is the kernel of the idea of Utopia right here

55:29.160 --> 55:35.960
in the figure of Achilles. So what's being said in the myth of Prometheus, where Prometheus knows

55:36.520 --> 55:43.320
that it's Achilles who's going to overthrow Zeus if he's allowed to be born as a demigod,

55:44.440 --> 55:47.880
is that there's a connection being made back to the story of the Iliad

55:48.600 --> 55:55.080
and to the first framing of a just order, as opposed to the de facto order of the world,

55:55.080 --> 56:02.040
the first aspiration for Utopia. That is also part and parcel of this part of the Prometheus myth.

56:02.040 --> 56:07.160
It's the birth of progressivism. And I just thought of something. There's an epigram in

56:07.160 --> 56:11.640
the first century. I think during the time of Vespasian or Domitian or something like that,

56:12.200 --> 56:18.920
Marshall was the author. And he says that he has a quick little hymn or epigram, I guess they're

56:18.920 --> 56:26.200
called, where he says Prometheus, just as Prometheus is bound to the Scythian cliff, nourished the

56:26.200 --> 56:33.240
constant bird with the glut of his stomach. So did Laurelis hanging from a cross that was no stage

56:33.240 --> 56:39.480
prop offered up his uncovered trails to the Caledonian bear. And I noticed that there's this

56:40.440 --> 56:49.160
this is somebody who's inspired by the Epicureans and the naturalists and the Stoics. And he's

56:49.160 --> 56:55.400
looking at Prometheus as an example, this great example of sacrificing yourself for the good,

56:55.400 --> 57:02.600
for the progress of the world. And that brings us to Christianity. Are they trying to do something

57:02.600 --> 57:08.600
similar to this with Jesus? I think so. Yes, although it's a perversion of it, and we'll come

57:08.680 --> 57:16.680
to that. But and notice also in this quote, the Scythian peaks. Right. So yet again, the Greeks

57:16.680 --> 57:22.280
knew that the place where Prometheus was bound was Scythian territory. And this connects again

57:22.280 --> 57:28.120
back to the myth of Amirani and how there's an awareness here that somehow this Prometheus myth

57:28.120 --> 57:34.920
has Scythian origins. Right. At least one of its vectors is Scythian. The other one is the

57:34.920 --> 57:40.120
myth of Enki and probably were fused in the Persian Empire. So speaking of the Persian Empire,

57:40.120 --> 57:48.680
we're talking about Escalus. And Escalus, you know, he's famous as a as a poetic playwright and

57:50.360 --> 57:57.640
really as the founder of drama. And, you know, in its current form, before Escalus,

57:57.640 --> 58:07.400
there was only a single bar reciting a poem on a stage. And it's Escalus who introduced other

58:07.400 --> 58:14.520
characters and created a drama where there's multiple perspectives. Right. And this is again,

58:14.520 --> 58:18.680
this is not where I was about to go. But, you know, again, we need to pause and just reflect on

58:18.680 --> 58:24.120
this for a minute. Yeah. But just just contemplate what a transformation of human consciousness

58:24.120 --> 58:27.320
that is. And again, this is something I go into at length in Prometheus and Atlas.

58:29.960 --> 58:37.560
Before Escalus, you had a bard who was basically reciting an ancestral tradition.

58:38.280 --> 58:46.280
And you only had that bard's perspective. And moreover, the bard did not insert himself into

58:46.920 --> 58:53.000
the poem so as to, you know, interject any commentary on it. Right. You're just having a

58:53.000 --> 59:01.640
person acting as a medium for the transmission of ancestral tradition. Escalus invents this thing,

59:02.520 --> 59:07.640
which we call drama in retrospect, where there's multiple characters and they each have their

59:07.640 --> 59:13.720
own perspective. So think about this. What effect does this have on people's consciousness where

59:13.720 --> 59:20.680
they're watching a stage play where for the first time, they're getting multiple characters

59:21.640 --> 59:28.600
with different divergent perspectives, each of which the audience member could choose to identify

59:28.600 --> 59:37.160
with and to flip between these divergent perspectives. And moreover, the setting for this

59:37.160 --> 59:42.840
drama with multiple characters in it is an amphitheater where literally there's multiple

59:42.840 --> 59:49.400
perspectives on the drama. Right. Depending on where you're sitting in the amphitheater on any

59:49.480 --> 59:57.160
given night, during the many times that you go to see a stage play, you will have one or another

59:57.160 --> 01:00:03.160
varying perspective on the drama. So there's the perspectival shift between the various characters

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:11.160
and then the perspectival shift in terms of geometry, perceptual geometry of the audience

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:17.560
member sitting in an amphitheater. And lo and behold, this is the moment when we go from really

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:23.480
stiff Egyptian style sculptures in Greece to photorealistic three-dimensional sculptures in

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:32.840
Greece with that extremely true to life, high precision that classical Greek sculptures are

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:37.640
famous for. Do you think that just happened by accident? Now what happened? Because you had

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:42.680
sculptors who were sitting there in amphitheaters watching stage plays from varying perspectives

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:49.080
on different night, different evenings, and they discovered perspective, both geometric

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:54.920
perspective and also psychological perspective by flipping between the viewpoints of different

01:00:54.920 --> 01:01:02.360
characters in a drama. Escalus is responsible for this. And which is the first of the dramas that

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:10.840
Escalus composed? Who is the first figure of tragedy, Prometheus? Right. So you see, this is

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:15.960
also bound up into the myth of Prometheus, this elevation mutation of human consciousness

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:22.440
that becomes so defining of classical Greek culture and in particular its excellence in the arts.

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:28.600
And then by extension, geometry as well, which becomes the cornerstone for all of the

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:33.960
sciences. I mean, let no one who hasn't studied geometry enter here. It was a

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:38.600
statement over the doorway to Plato's Academy. And by the way, in Plato's Academy,

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:45.880
since I mentioned that Plato's Academy, there was a altar to Prometheus. Wow. There was a burning

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:56.520
fire on an altar in Plato's Academy. And there was a tradition of lighting torches in this fire altar

01:01:56.520 --> 01:02:04.360
and running them down into the city of Athens from there. And in fact, Plato opens his republic,

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:11.080
which is probably his most Promethean text. Plato opens republic with the image of this torch race,

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:20.040
this torch bearing rally, the torch bearing relay race is the opening of Plato's republic.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:27.720
And you know, this became then the basis for the lighting of the torch and the passing of the torch

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:31.880
in the Olympic Games, which probably shouldn't be called the Olympic Games, it should be called

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:40.600
the Promethean Games. Anyway, to go back to Escalus, because where did we, how did we get here? We

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:45.400
got here, I was talking about the Persian Empire. Right. Well, I was actually going to jump in real

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:49.800
quick before we get back to him. There's an author named, he's actually pretty famous, Erratus the,

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:55.960
Erratus thes. He's Erratus thes. Erratus thes. Sorry, I'm sorry. And he's one of the greatest

01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:01.800
scientists of the age. And he has a story of Alexander the Great being in a cave near

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:07.800
Caucasus, where he identifies that the demigod Prometheus was here being imprisoned.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:15.640
So Alexander the Great was like, this is a sacred place. Everybody stop what you're doing.

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:20.600
Let's offer sacrifice to Prometheus right here right now. And then Errin and Nicomedia also has

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:26.360
the same story in his books too. So that's just shows you how these elites love this god. He's

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:30.040
he's another category. He's special.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.520
Let me let me just comment on that before we go back to the thread about Escalus,

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:41.640
because you said certain elites, whatever. Yeah. Well,

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:51.000
one can say many things about the Rockefellers, but one thing that David Rockefeller did that

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:57.560
was quite impressive was erect the statue of Prometheus in Rockefeller Center.

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:06.920
And which I tend to think of as the hard fire of New York City and basically the

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:13.800
sacred center of what is still hanging on as the cosmopolitan capital of the planet.

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:19.320
And when you look at the statue of Prometheus at Rockefeller Center,

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:24.520
it's Prometheus emerging from a rock

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:37.080
soaring through the celestial equator crossing the plane of the zodiac. So it's the

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:43.320
ecliptic and the zodiac and Prometheus is soaring through that emerging from out of a rock.

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:52.040
Well, the crossing of the celestial equator and the and the, you know, zodiac, plane of the zodiac

01:04:53.480 --> 01:05:01.560
is the main symbol of Mithraism because Mithra grabs hold of the wheel work of the heavens

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:08.680
and shifts, you know, the sphere of the heavens creating the procession of the equinoxes

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:19.480
as he overpowers Zorvan or Kronos. Again, like Prometheus siding with Zeus to overthrow Kronos,

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:26.840
right? And then in the myths of Mithras, there are two versions of the myth of the birth of Mithras.

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:32.440
One of them is that he was born of a virgin, but that's the less popular version that then,

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:37.880
you know, influenced Christianity. The more popular version was that Mithra was born of a rock

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:46.440
he was born from out of a rock. Yeah. And moreover, in Mithraism, there is this stage of initiation,

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:55.160
penultimate stage of initiation, heliodromous, where the stage of the solar charioteer, where the

01:05:55.160 --> 01:06:04.040
solar charioteer goes up there into the heavens and sets the world on fire, throws fire down. You

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:09.640
know, that praise from Jesus and the Gospels, I have come to cast fire upon the earth, right?

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:14.840
And so that's taken from this great initiation in Mithraism, where there's a casting of fire

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:22.920
down upon the earth from heaven. In the Greek, it's fire from Arunos. Fire from Arunos. And then

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:28.840
Elijah also says that too. And it's funny because Arunos is translated as heaven, but he's also a

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:33.880
god, the sky god, the heavens god. And he's a father of the, isn't he like the grandfather of the

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:44.520
Titans or something like that? Yes. So that's, that's right. And so, so, you know, Prometheus is

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:52.440
grandfather, right? grandfather Prometheus, who together with Gaia sired the Titans. And so in

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:56.920
the statue at Rockefeller Center, you see this flame in the hand of Prometheus. But here's the

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.200
thing. Prometheus, he's soaring up from the rock. So he's born out of the rock like Mithra.

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:08.760
He's soaring up over the crossing of the ecliptic and the plane of the zodiac like Mithra. And he's,

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:14.440
so he's in the heavens now, and he's holding this flame. And you have to, he's not holding a torch

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:18.520
bringing the fire to mankind, although obviously that's implied. It's Prometheus, right? Yeah.

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:24.040
Holding this flame in his hand, almost as if he's about to cast it down onto the earth.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:31.240
So yet again, it's a reference to the myth of Mithra, particularly the grade of Chileodromos or

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:36.280
the solar chariots here, which is an image of a future fiery apocalypse of the earth that comes

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:43.000
from out of ancient Iranian religion. And so you were mentioning, how did I get here? The elites

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.440
and Prometheus, whoever designed that statue, I mean, man ship is credited with that statue,

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:54.440
but who told them to design it that way? And you know, what role did David Rockefeller have or

01:07:54.440 --> 01:08:03.400
people around him? Whatever they were thinking, they knew that Prometheus is Mithra. They're the

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:10.120
same figure. I can see that too. This is an esoteric truth that's known by certain occult elites

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:16.600
throughout history, that Prometheus, the Titan, is the Titan Mithra. And you know, Mithra,

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:23.400
in the Indo-European religions, you always have this division between the gods and the Titans that

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:29.880
exists in every form of Indo-European religion. And in the Indo-Iranian branch, there is, like in

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:35.720
the Greek branch, this division between the Ahuras or Ashuras and the Devas, the Titans and the gods.

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:44.600
And Mithra is the most important of the Titans. So at war with Indra, who is this kind of thunderbolt

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:53.000
wielding Zeus-like figure among the Pantheon of the gods, among the Devas. So okay, you have that.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.120
But where were we? We were talking about Escalus. And I just wanted to also mention the fact that

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:05.320
Escalus served in the Persian wars. And one of the other plays that he's famous for is the play

01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:12.040
The Persians. He wrote a play The Persians. And you know, we were just talking about the invention

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:20.440
of perspective by Escalus in the context of, you know, his crafting of the art form of tragedy,

01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:27.640
tragic drama. And it's interesting that in the Persians, Escalus is able to take the

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:34.040
perspective of the Persians. The Persians doesn't trash the Persians. It's a relatively sympathetic

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:43.560
portrayal of the Persians, including of Xerxes as a kind of tragic figure who, yeah, he suffers from

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:51.080
hubris. But so does Prometheus. And Prometheus is the hero of the Prometheus trilogy, which we only

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:55.960
we only have Prometheus bound left. But originally it was Prometheus the Firebringer,

01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:01.560
Prometheus bound, and then Prometheus unbound. It's like Dark Knight, the trilogy. You have Dark

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:06.200
Knight, and he rises and then yeah. Exactly. Prometheus unbound was supposed to be the part

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:11.160
where Hercules comes and frees him, right, and so on kills the eagle and all that. And so this was

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:18.360
this great trilogy. It was the first proper drama of the Western world. And Prometheus was the first

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:25.960
tragic hero of the Western world. And so when he writes The Persians, and he depicts Xerxes as this

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:31.640
kind of tragic figure who suffers from his hubris, suffers a downfall on account of his hubris,

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:37.880
he's in a way almost empathizing with the enemy that he fought against on the battlefield

01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:42.920
as a soldier in the Persian wars. He got into the mind of the enemy, and he was able to write this

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:48.600
drama, which, you know, portrays the Persians as something other than a cardboard cut out.

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:53.320
And that's also quite fascinating. And I don't think it's incidental at all,

01:10:53.960 --> 01:11:01.480
that Prometheus gets valorized as a heroic figure, as a not just creator, but champion and benefactor

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:08.120
of mankind against the tyrannical and unjust God at just the time when the Persian Empire takes over

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:17.320
a large part of Greece. Askelos is living in a Persian dominated Greece. Yes, the Athenians are

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:22.520
still resisting, but most of Greece is under Persian rule at this time. And the cities where

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:30.440
philosophy is getting off the ground are all Persian ruled cities. And so, you know, not only

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:35.960
does the Prometheus myth have an Indo-European kernel in the myth of Amirani, there's a reevaluation

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:42.520
of Prometheus in Greek culture, where he goes from being this, the story of Prometheus goes from being

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:54.360
this, how can I put it, warning against defying the gods, a kind of morality tale that is meant to

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:59.800
emphasize the power of Zeus, which is what you get in Hesiod, and the earliest presentation of

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:07.000
Prometheus, to the Prometheus of Eskelos, who is a tragic hero. What's responsible for that almost

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:13.000
moral inversion that takes place that what Nietzsche would call reevaluation of values,

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:19.080
what's responsible for that? Well, the Persian colonization of Greece, because from the Persian

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:28.600
Zoroastrian or Mithraic perspective, Zeus is Ahreman and Prometheus is Ahura Mazda and or Mithra.

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:34.680
And so, you can see reflected in the reevaluation of Prometheus as a hero,

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:43.240
a Greek assimilation of Persian ideas, which then becomes fundamental for the whole developmental

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:49.160
trajectory of the Western world, you know, the developmental trajectory that Oswald Spengler

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:57.560
winds up calling Faustian. Spengler calls the West Faustian on the basis of Goethe's Faust,

01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:03.240
Goethe's popularization of this alchemist, medieval alchemist who makes a deal with the

01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:09.800
devil and so on and so forth, right? And basically, you know, usurps godly powers.

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:17.000
But in fact, Goethe, the author of Faust, admitted that in the dark night of his soul,

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:28.840
at the time in his life where he felt most alone and alienated and aggrieved, he looked to Prometheus

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:37.320
as his personal savior. Goethe wrote a, attempted to write a drama on Prometheus and he has a poem

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:45.640
that survived a fragmentary poem about Prometheus. And so Goethe, who's, you know, in hindsight,

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:53.000
through Spengler, responsible for coining the term the Faustian world to refer to the West,

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:56.440
Goethe actually admitted that Prometheus was his god.

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:03.160
Wow. That's what I wanted to get to in a second. But before I get to, I was going to ask you,

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:07.720
what's Prometheus, the state of Prometheus right now? What's his fate? Does he die? Does

01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:11.400
is he ruin the world right now? What are your thoughts on that? But I also want to get into

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:16.920
the Gnost, how this trickles down into Gnostic theology. Which one do you think is, which one

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:24.680
should we tackle first? Well, they're deeply interrelated, okay, because, and okay, let me,

01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:35.240
let me try to condense, you know, a rather complex and large scale observation into something as

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:40.600
concise as possible. And that's that just from, you know, the elements that we've already looked

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:48.680
at in the myth of Prometheus, you can see how this is a prototype for a lot of Gnostic mythology

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:53.320
and for the idea of the Gnostic savior, and for rebellion against the Archons and so on and so

01:14:53.320 --> 01:15:00.200
forth. And you have the imagery of this, the serpent coiled around the tree as evil, whereas in

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:07.960
this, um, polemicized, you know, what do you, what do you say, Tannock, I guess, because it's

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:13.080
opposing it. This is the symbol of wisdom and knowledge. And for some reason, one's bad,

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:20.360
one's evil. And it's like, what's, they're at odds here. So yeah. Yes. And so very long story

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:29.800
short. And if you want to, to see my more in depth analysis of this in Prometheus, I get into this

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:35.240
in greater detail. And also, believe it or not, in my book, Closer Encounters, I wrote a book on

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:41.400
the UFO phenomenon called Closer Encounters. And it's a bit of a tome. It's a comprehensive

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:47.080
analysis of the entire close encounter phenomenon. And in chapter six, in the penultimate chapter

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:53.880
of that book, I get into Christianity in depth and detail and the genesis of the, the, the Christ

01:15:53.880 --> 01:16:03.160
mythos. Okay. And how it is a form of social engineering, uh, by means of cognitive dissonance.

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:12.760
So in the Christ mythos, you have on the one hand Jesus in the gospels very clearly saying

01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:19.560
that Jehovah is his father, that he's there to represent Yahweh. Yahweh is his father.

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:28.040
And in fact, not a dot of an I or a cross of a T from the Tanakh, the Old Testament, will pass out

01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:36.280
of existence or out of relevance until the end of the world. And so Jesus speaking through one side

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:43.160
of his mouth affirms all the legalism of the Old Testament and takes pride in being the son

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:51.720
of this genocidal, tyrannical maniac sadist who is responsible for Moses' slaughter of these poor

01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:57.160
golden calf worshipping, dancing Israelites in the Sinai Desert, who's responsible for the genocide

01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:02.840
at Jericho, who's responsible for like just all the most horrendous, brutally inhuman acts you

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:08.680
can imagine, um, that are chronicled throughout the Old Testament. And of course, for all the

01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:15.320
wonderful laws and Leviticus and Deuteronomy, right? I mean, the most like despicably inhuman,

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:24.680
uh, legal code and, um, basically structure of theocratic authority that we've seen in human

01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:31.240
history. And so Jesus on the one hand is coming to validate all of that. And when you look at Jesus

01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:35.560
from that perspective, you know, through those particular verses in the gospels, then the only

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:41.160
problem, sure, he says to the Jews, you know, you, you're, you're disinherited. The kingdom doesn't

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:46.120
belong to you anymore. It belongs to humanity. It belongs to anyone who follows my father, right?

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:50.440
From that perspective, his only problem with the Jews is the same problem that Yahweh had with the

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:55.000
Jews throughout the whole Old Testament, where Yahweh keeps telling these Jews, you rebellious

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.160
people never learn a lesson. He says they're uniquely rebellious people, right? Cause they

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:03.880
keep disobeying somehow, called them stiff neck people. Yep. Neck Israelites. They keep setting

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:08.760
up idols of various kinds of worshiping ish tar and ball and this one and that one. Okay.

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:12.600
And so Jesus's problem with the Jews is, is just that it's that, look,

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:18.040
Yahweh's had enough with your stiff, stiff neck rebelliousness. And so you're disinherited. You're

01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:22.760
not the chosen people anymore. And the kingdom belongs, belongs to anybody who submits to Yahweh

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:29.160
through me. So that's one Jesus. And that's the Jesus that, you know, for all the differences

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:37.560
between Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Protestantism, including the evangelical churches

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:41.880
in the United States, for all the various doctrinal differences between these warring sects of

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:47.320
Christianity, all of them accept that version of Jesus in one way or another. That's the

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:52.760
institutional Jesus. And then you have this Gnostic Jesus. And what is this not? And there are

01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:57.640
verses in the Gospels that support that too. Absolutely. All verses in the Gnostic Gospels.

01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:02.120
And what the Gospels that were rejected at Nicaea, right? And what does this Jesus tell you?

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:07.000
Well, this Jesus tells you, I mean, that, you know, the law, you don't need to follow the law

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:14.040
as long as, you know, you, you, yeah, it's about the spirit and not the law. And

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:20.280
the world is a fallen material creation anyway. And Jesus is here to free you from the world,

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:24.840
because just like him, you're not of the world. And the world was created by these inferior

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:29.560
archons and not by the true God. And he's the way to find the true God and so on and so forth.

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:37.880
Yeah. But here's the thing. The Gnostic version of Christianity is pacifist. Yeah.

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:45.160
The Gnostic Jesus is a radical pacifist who rejects political rebellion.

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:51.880
To the extent that you embrace the legalistic Jesus that affirms Yahweh in the Old Testament,

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:56.360
maybe you could see that Jesus as a kind of political rebel. But if you go in the Gnostic

01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:01.000
direction, then you're really emphasizing the pacifistic passages in the Gospels. And so

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:08.520
Gnosticism, Christian Gnosticism is a doctrine of pacifism. Why? Because this is a fallen world

01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:13.880
governed by archons. And to the extent that you participate in political power, you are being

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:21.640
corrupted by archons, power is inherently corrupting from a Gnostic perspective. And if you ask me,

01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:25.240
and I've laid this argument out at length in my various writings, like I just said,

01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:35.000
this is cognitive dissonance. This is a doctrine directed to demoralize and

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:43.880
degenerate society. Because first of all, you're left in an intellectual contradiction.

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:48.280
You're left in an intellectual contradiction. Do I follow the Old Testament? Don't I follow

01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:53.000
the Old Testament? This Jesus keeps contradicting himself, which then it screws with your head.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.160
It's cognitive dissonance. You're made to believe, you're made to take on faith

01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:01.080
two things that are contradictory to believe them at the same time.

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:07.880
Yeah. And what does that do? It puts you in a mental state where you're suffering extreme

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:15.160
tension. And in order to resolve that tension, you will latch on to anything as a life raft.

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.760
It's a psychological tactic.

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:20.360
It becomes a buffet of ideas that you can just pick and choose from. You know what?

01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:24.920
Real quick, I just want to jump in real quick. Because one of the oldest monasteries that was

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:30.120
abandoned when Islam took over the Byzantine Eastern Empire, right next to where they thought

01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:35.400
Mount Sinai was, which I don't know if it really is or not. But anyway, there was a monastery there.

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:40.200
And there's one of the oldest depictions of Jesus in the world that they found in this place.

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:44.520
And they figured out that if you mirror one side of Jesus's face, you get a perfect image.

01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:46.760
And if you mirror the other side, you get a perfect image.

01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:52.200
They're imposing two different faces on Jesus's face to show his dual nature.

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:55.640
So the early Christians knew what you're saying right now. This wasn't a secret.

01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:02.360
This whole idea of putting a Bible in one spot and making a canon wasn't even a thing.

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:08.680
Marcian had his own gospel. He picked and choose what Jesus wanted to have in his own Bible.

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:11.880
The Gnostics had their own Jesus. The other guys had their own Jesus.

01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:15.400
It wasn't until later that they put it all in one spot. And that's how you get this

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:20.280
weird schizophrenic message. But yeah, but to add to that.

01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:29.480
But here's my point, Neil, is that regardless of which Jesus you go for, neither the institutional

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:36.600
legalistic Jesus, who is the son of Yahweh, nor the antinomian Gnostic savior,

01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:48.280
is a figure who inspires active rebellion against unjust divinities, let's say.

01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:53.480
Not to call them gods, right? The beings that become God and the angels for the Christians

01:22:53.480 --> 01:23:00.360
and used to be Zeus and the Olympians for the Greeks, right? Neither image of Jesus

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:06.360
inspires active, meaning political rebellion against the unjust rule of heaven.

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:13.400
So Gnosticism is inherently disempowering. Christian Gnosticism is debilitating

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:20.040
because of its pacifism, because of the association of power inherently with the Arkons.

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:25.960
Whereas in the myth of Prometheus, you see a prototype for all of the most positive elements

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:35.240
of Gnosticism. But you see them in a context which totally rejects pacifism and calls for a militant

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:42.520
resistance against the unjust tyranny of heaven over the earth. And a demand for the

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:52.200
self-determination of mankind. So in that sense, Prometheism, a kind of theism based on Prometheus,

01:23:53.160 --> 01:24:01.320
the spirituality that's implicit in the myth of Prometheus, is protonostic, but it's satanic.

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:09.000
And this brings me to the other aspect of your question about where is Prometheus today,

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:16.200
what happened with Prometheus later. And so we see a reappropriation of the myth of Prometheus

01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:23.080
at the dawn of the modern age, where you have Romantic poets, I mentioned Dutta earlier,

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:32.680
also Lord Byron, who writes a poem about Prometheus. And then most famously Byron's best friend,

01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:40.040
Percy Shelley, who writes Prometheus Unbound, which is a four act play,

01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:47.240
about the whole mythos of Prometheus, including the parts of the story that were lost in the

01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:52.680
version of Escalus, about Prometheus ultimately being freed from his chains and so on and so forth.

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:59.880
And one really interesting thing about the Prometheus Unbound play written by Percy Shelley

01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:07.720
around 1820, is that he uses all Latin names for the characters. Like he uses Jupiter instead of

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:14.840
Zeus, or Mercury instead of Hermes, but not for Prometheus. And what would Prometheus be in Latin?

01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:22.680
Lucifer. And he makes it abundantly clear, Shelley does, that the flood, you know, the flood that

01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:31.080
Ducalion helps save some portion of mankind from, is the flood of Noah. And that the civilization

01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:38.680
that was destroyed by Yahweh was Atlantis, is the Greek Atlantis, the ruins of Atlantis at the

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:45.320
bottom of the ocean, feature in Shelley's Prometheus Unbound play. And so Shelley underlines the fact

01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:53.240
that Prometheus is deeply connected to Atlantis. It's not accidental that, or incidental, that

01:25:53.880 --> 01:26:01.720
the king of Atlantis is named Atlas. So Atlantis means the realm of Atlas. That's where the name

01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:08.520
Atlantis comes from. It means the realm of Atlas, because Poseidia was ruled by a king called Atlas.

01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:15.480
In fact, the kings were all called Atlas. And so I'm guessing this was a title, not a proper name

01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:20.920
of a person. And the person who was the sovereign of Atlantis was given this title,

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:29.000
in reference to the brother of Prometheus, namely the Titan Atlas, who leads the Titans in

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:35.560
war against the gods. He's the general of the Titan army in the Titanomachia. And what do the

01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:41.160
Atlanteans do? The core of the myth of Atlantis, the Plato recounts for us in Timaeus and Critias,

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:48.440
is that the Atlanteans lead a war against the Limpus. They attempt to unify the whole earth

01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:54.680
under their naval rule. And they're no longer worshiping the gods. They've become totally

01:26:54.680 --> 01:27:00.200
irreverent toward the Olympians. And this is why when they're on the brink of unifying the whole

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:08.920
earth, Zeus decides to wipe them off the face of the planet with this deluge. So Shelley,

01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:16.360
in Prometheus' Unbound, depicts the destruction of Atlantis. And he makes it quite clear that this

01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:24.600
is a parallel to the biblical flood story. And he's associating Prometheus with the rebel angels,

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:32.120
with the fallen angels, who were punished by Yahweh. And so, point being, in the modern era,

01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:42.840
you see authors like Götta, Lord Byron, and Percy Shelley explicitly appropriate the myth of Prometheus

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:56.280
as a positive image of Satan. People often talk about Satan as an entirely negative figure

01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:03.160
that cannot be dissociated from Christianity, that's predicated on Christianity, that's parasitic

01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:10.600
on Christianity. But folks, there's a Satan before Satan, and that's Prometheus. And one place that

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:16.520
this becomes abundantly clear is in the modern Prometheus. You ask about where is Prometheus

01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:22.120
today? Where is Prometheus in the modern age? Well, look, the alternate title for Frankenstein,

01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:29.880
the subtitle of the book, is the modern Prometheus. So Percy's wife, Mary Shelley, pens this tale in

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:37.720
which we have an extremely Luciferian depiction of Dr. Frankenstein as the modern Prometheus.

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:46.200
And so, you know, we're on the verge of a new world with AI and virtual reality and all this

01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:52.040
cutting edge technology that's really going to change everything. Like, we're right on the

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:57.640
border of what's about to happen. Yes, and Frankenstein was the first of these great sci-fi stories

01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:03.880
that involved transhuman technologies. And you can see the debt to Frankenstein or the modern

01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:08.600
Prometheus throughout the history of modern science fiction, up to and including Ridley Scott's

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:14.600
Prometheus. Ridley Scott's film in 2012, Prometheus, the prequel to the alien saga,

01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:22.840
is very much a retelling of Frankenstein in a cosmic context. So the myth of Prometheus,

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:27.320
I would say, is very much alive. Yeah. Well, especially if you combine it with Mithra, because

01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:32.360
we live in a legalistic age, everything we do is all, you know, sign this document, you know,

01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:38.120
make sure that everything's lawful. Like, no, but you have like banking systems and we have systems

01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:46.840
in place, PayPal, it's all mediators and signing on the dotted line and technology. It really is

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:53.400
in a spiritual sense, whether you, however you want to interpret this, it's a world ruled by

01:29:53.400 --> 01:30:03.240
Prometheus hyphen Mithra. Yeah. And the point is to take back this technology to,

01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:13.640
you know, reintegrate these capacities that we were gifted with by Prometheus for the sake of

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:19.400
fostering human flourishing, rather than allowing ourselves to be dehumanized by this technology.

01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:27.240
Right. Prometheus brought the gift of technique to man so that we could determine our own destiny,

01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:32.440
not so that we could wind up being instrumentalized into something like the board, not so that,

01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:39.320
you know, AI could ensconce us in such a fashion as to, you know, divest us of our humanity and,

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:46.360
you know, leave us with a hive mind. So, you know, right now we are at the 11th hour,

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:51.560
we're at a key turning point in the face of the technological singularity where we have to

01:30:52.760 --> 01:31:01.480
basically retrieve the poetic power of the Prometheus myth and to understand technological

01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:09.240
science in the right way as a tool to empower our evolution so that we can transform, you know,

01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:15.320
like that caterpillar in the chrysalis into the butterfly, the butterfly that appears

01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:20.760
at the creation of humanity in the myth of Prometheus. And so I would say that, you know,

01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:30.520
Prometheus is a figure that represents the promise of technological science,

01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:36.280
but there's also this shadow side, this Frankensteinian danger that we face,

01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:41.480
right, approaching this technological singularity within this very century.

01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:48.120
And so it's more important than ever right now to positively re-appropriate this myth

01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:54.040
and understand the power that it already has over us unconsciously. We need to take that

01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:59.960
unconscious power, that demonic power, of the Prometheus archetype over our society

01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:04.760
and transform it into something that's more self-conscious and that can be directed in a

01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:12.040
positive manner as a force of liberation and enlightenment. Yeah, and do you think

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:17.880
for in the context of like, I don't know, maybe climate change, for example, like,

01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:25.000
if there's some sort of, some sort of threat of some disaster on earth, Prometheus being the

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:30.680
archetype of this, the only thing that can save us is, you know, we have to figure out a way through

01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:35.960
technology to get ourselves right, maybe, I don't know, go off into space or something,

01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:40.360
I don't even know what that is, but that also represents this sort of butterfly effect of

01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:45.720
like a metamorphosis of the human nature, of humanity. Like, we need to change something,

01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:49.800
or else if we keep going down this path, it's done, we're done, we're going to be wiped out,

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:56.440
right? Absolutely, that's right. But we also need to remember that, so, you know, retreat,

01:32:56.440 --> 01:33:01.720
ludditism and retreat back to nature and to pre-industrial society and all this crap that's

01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:07.320
being promoted by a lot of elites today, right, the eco-friendly lifestyle. No, no, no, no, we

01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:13.000
can use technology to save the ecosystem. But the other thing we have to remember is that Prometheus

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:20.040
didn't just give us the fire of the forge, the fire that he gifted mankind with is also the fountain

01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:27.880
head of all of the arts and crafts. In other words, literature, painting, right, drama,

01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:37.240
as per Escalus. So there is a unity of science and art that, you know, is at the core of the

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:46.440
myth of Prometheus. And we need to cultivate that aesthetic sensibility so that we use technology

01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:52.840
in ways that are poetic, in ways that are not alienating and instrumentalizing, but that are

01:33:52.840 --> 01:34:00.040
part of the expansion of the creative capacity of humanity. Because Prometheus is also the deity

01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:08.680
of the arts, of literature, of poetry. And that's something that we shouldn't lose sight of, right,

01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:14.360
as we enter this crucible of the technological singularity, we are going to need to be more

01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:21.960
artful than ever before. So that we use technology as a tool for liberation and empowerment,

01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:25.000
rather than allowing it to be an instrument of dehumanization.

01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:32.600
Yeah, I think the idea of becoming like gods, by copying what's in nature onto technology,

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:39.640
we can create systems of travel or whatever, that is just beyond our even capacity to even think

01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:44.440
how great we can be right now, you know? As Shelley says, and this is a good note to end on,

01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:54.440
as Shelley says in Prometheus Unbound, we can come up with arts as of yet undreamed of, arts

01:34:54.440 --> 01:35:00.760
that have been, haven't even been conceived by the mind of the gods, right? And so it's not a

01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:05.640
question of copying nature, it's a question of bettering nature, we can do better than nature,

01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:11.640
we can do better than the gods, we can improve upon nature. And so therefore you see that from a

01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:17.320
Christian perspective, right, even including a Gnostic Christian perspective, because the Gnostic

01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:21.320
doesn't want to improve this world, the Gnostic wants to escape this world. From a Christian

01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:29.240
perspective, Gnostic or otherwise, this is Satanic. The idea that we can do better than the gods,

01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:35.240
we can best God more nature, that is the core of the Prometheus-ness.

01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:42.040
It's eating the fruit of knowledge, literally. It's accepting, and by the way, it's also reflected

01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:49.960
in Persephone eating the pomegranate, it's like a mirror of that. But speaking of taking the fruit

01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:55.720
of knowledge, you have just attained true Gnosis. And by the way, check out Jason Rezegerd on his

01:35:55.720 --> 01:36:00.280
books on Amazon, links are in the description. You have just attained true Gnosis.

01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:06.280
The Demiurge has no power over you.
