00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
Abram was 75 years old when he left Haran.

00:05.440 --> 00:12.480
Abram took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all of their possessions and those who became

00:12.480 --> 00:17.920
members of their household in Haran, and they set out for the land of Canaan.

00:17.920 --> 00:24.520
When they arrived in Canaan, Abram traveled through the land as far as the sacred place

00:24.520 --> 00:28.320
at Shechem, the Oak of Mora.

00:28.320 --> 00:31.600
The Canaanites lived in the land at that time.

00:31.600 --> 00:38.400
The Lord appeared to Abram and said, I give this land to your descendants.

00:38.400 --> 00:42.120
So Abram built an altar there to the Lord who appeared to him.

00:55.520 --> 01:01.880
The religious beliefs of Israel are rooted in the shared culture of Canaan,

01:01.880 --> 01:07.440
although it had unique attributes that differed from the Canaanites.

01:07.440 --> 01:12.080
It still found expression in shared practices and language.

01:12.080 --> 01:17.160
Some traditional practices could not be merged with Yahwism,

01:17.520 --> 01:24.720
but others like the sacred poetry, the music, and the architecture of the Canaanites

01:24.720 --> 01:31.160
were adopted and became integral to the Israelite religion.

01:31.160 --> 01:36.720
The Old Testament's embrace or rejection of these elements

01:36.720 --> 01:46.280
means that the Canaanite religious influences still affect us today through biblical narratives.

01:46.280 --> 01:53.200
The things that the Bible are condemning in the Old Testament are, in fact,

01:53.200 --> 01:57.600
the culture that the Israelites at the time of writing the Bible

01:57.600 --> 02:02.360
are trying to distance themselves from in their own past.

02:02.360 --> 02:09.080
Things like human sacrifice, idolatry, and the worship of more than one God.

02:09.080 --> 02:14.240
These are the things that they themselves practice just like everyone else in the world.

02:14.240 --> 02:20.760
And these are the things that they will polemicize in the text to divorce themselves from their past.

02:27.480 --> 02:32.960
Before the findings at Ugarit Rosh Shamra in 1928,

02:32.960 --> 02:39.880
our knowledge of Canaanite religion was minimal and largely from indirect sources.

02:39.880 --> 02:43.720
The Old Testament didn't mention Canaanite deities and rituals,

02:43.720 --> 02:48.440
but these were often in a negative light making interpretations challenging.

02:48.440 --> 02:56.200
Mentions of Canaanite gods and rituals were also found in Egyptian, Mesopotamian, and Phoenician writings,

02:56.200 --> 03:00.000
including the Karatepe inscriptions from 1946.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.600
However, these weren't enough to form a complete understanding.

03:04.600 --> 03:09.320
Greek historians provided accounts of Canaanite beliefs,

03:09.320 --> 03:14.240
but it was hard to distinguish authentic traditions from later additions,

03:14.240 --> 03:18.520
excavations at places like Biblos and Megiddo.

03:18.520 --> 03:22.520
Give us glimpses, but only a fragmentary picture.

03:22.520 --> 03:27.600
Thanks to the discoveries at Rosh Shamra, ancient Ugarit in North Syria,

03:27.600 --> 03:30.640
the Canaanites tell us their own story.

03:30.640 --> 03:37.680
Hundreds of clay tablets found here, written in a dialect close to the biblical Hebrew,

03:37.760 --> 03:40.120
and offers rich insights.

03:40.120 --> 03:48.040
These tablets feature extensive mythological poems, records related to the temple services,

03:48.040 --> 03:55.400
lists of deities and sacrifices, and details about temple workers and rituals.

03:55.400 --> 04:00.400
Additionally, artifacts linked to gods like Baal and Dagon,

04:00.400 --> 04:05.800
including temple remains and stelae, have been discovered.

04:05.880 --> 04:12.640
It's crucial to understand, though, that while there was a core Canaanite religious belief,

04:12.640 --> 04:15.920
local variations existed.

04:15.920 --> 04:21.520
I mean, they didn't have the internet and no email and the mail system wasn't very great.

04:21.520 --> 04:25.080
So every city you went to had their own ideas.

04:25.080 --> 04:31.440
Not every Canaanite city would have worshiped all the same gods that we know from these texts.

04:31.440 --> 04:33.320
There were variations at play.

04:33.320 --> 04:38.720
The Canaanite religion was more of a public affair than a personal one.

04:38.720 --> 04:46.520
Its rituals, mostly centered on ensuring fertility, were community events.

04:46.520 --> 04:52.440
Though there were individual acts of devotion as seen in the Phoenician inscriptions,

04:52.440 --> 04:57.720
the religion was mainly a communal way to connect with nature's forces.

04:57.760 --> 05:03.800
This involved practices believed to ensure continued creation and rejuvenation.

05:03.800 --> 05:07.440
The prominence of some deities in mythological writings

05:07.440 --> 05:13.040
doesn't always reflect their actual popularity among Canaanite devotees.

05:13.040 --> 05:17.520
Conversely, some gods like Dagon had a minimal role in myths,

05:17.520 --> 05:20.760
merely acknowledged as Baal's father,

05:20.760 --> 05:27.920
but seemed quite revered as evidenced by a dedicated temple and two stele in Ugarit.

05:33.920 --> 05:39.960
El, the Hebrew word for God, is the supreme God and Creator

05:39.960 --> 05:43.480
and shows up as Allah in Arabic.

05:43.480 --> 05:48.520
Variations in the name El are found in many Semitic languages,

05:48.520 --> 05:52.480
Ugaritic, Phoenician, Hebrew, Aramaic, Akkadian.

05:52.480 --> 05:58.160
In Northwestern Semitic cultures, El was a term for any deity

05:58.160 --> 06:01.120
and also specifically for the primary god.

06:01.120 --> 06:04.880
He often stood at the top of many divine hierarchies

06:04.880 --> 06:07.960
and played roles like the god of creation

06:07.960 --> 06:12.240
or the father of gods in certain Canaanite and Ugaritic sources.

06:12.240 --> 06:16.360
Yet, using the name El can be confusing

06:16.360 --> 06:21.880
because sometimes it refers to the main god and at other times to different gods.

06:21.880 --> 06:28.600
For instance, in Ugaritic texts the phrase El-Melik means El the king,

06:28.600 --> 06:33.600
while El Haddad refers to the God Haddad.

06:33.600 --> 06:38.480
In Ugaritic, the plural for gods aligns with the Hebrew term

06:38.480 --> 06:43.640
that sometimes means the singular god Elohim, for example.

06:43.640 --> 06:49.400
Some believe that various authors change stories from polytheistic context

06:49.400 --> 06:51.600
into monotheistic ones.

06:51.600 --> 06:56.200
I myself subscribe to this idea and I will show this in this video.

06:56.200 --> 07:00.880
And this causes many inconsistencies in the text,

07:00.880 --> 07:04.200
but once you see it, everything starts to make sense.

07:04.200 --> 07:09.120
Names with the stem El appear in many Semitic regions

07:09.120 --> 07:17.920
among the Amorites and Sabaic people in the southern Levant.

07:17.920 --> 07:21.800
Several ancient texts in inscriptions mention El

07:21.800 --> 07:25.640
or connect him with other deities from different cultures,

07:25.640 --> 07:30.040
indicating his widespread recognition and influence.

07:30.040 --> 07:36.760
For instance, the Egyptian god Patah shared an epithet with El

07:36.760 --> 07:41.600
and an ancient script described El as the god of eternity.

07:41.600 --> 07:49.200
The Egyptian deity Patah was labeled Lord of Gath in a prism from Tel Lakish.

07:49.200 --> 08:00.720
And on the other side, it bears the name of Amenhotep II, Pharaoh from 1435 to 1420 BCE.

08:00.720 --> 08:09.440
This title also appears in Serabit text 353.

08:09.440 --> 08:15.760
Ta is frequently referred to as Lord or the Eternal One.

08:15.760 --> 08:21.560
This association between El and Patah that brought about the consistent use of olam,

08:21.560 --> 08:24.200
meaning eternal, for El.

08:24.200 --> 08:29.600
Although in Ugaritic records, Ta seems to be more closely related

08:29.600 --> 08:35.760
to the artisan deity Kothar Wachasus, an additional link is observed

08:35.760 --> 08:41.720
with the Mandian angel Patah El, blending the names Patah and El together.

08:41.720 --> 08:48.720
Herodotus, the famous Greek historian who wrote in the 5th century BCE,

08:48.720 --> 08:55.080
who never mentions anything about Israel, Jerusalem or Yahweh or anything like King David or Moses,

08:55.080 --> 08:59.360
does have some interesting things to say about the god Patah,

08:59.360 --> 09:05.320
who he calls by his Greek equivalent Hephaestus.

09:05.320 --> 09:10.520
After the reign of the priest of Hephaestus Patah, the Egyptians were made free,

09:10.520 --> 09:17.680
but they could never live without a king, so they divided Egypt into 12 districts and set up 12 kings.

09:17.680 --> 09:22.200
These kings intermarried and agreed to be close friends,

09:22.200 --> 09:26.840
no one deposing another or seeking to possess more than another.

09:26.840 --> 09:32.200
The reason for this agreement, which they scrupulously kept, was this.

09:32.200 --> 09:36.840
No sooner were they established in their districts than an oracle was given them,

09:36.840 --> 09:42.920
that whichever of them poured a libation from a bronze vessel in the temple of Hephaestus Patah,

09:42.920 --> 09:49.240
whereas in all the temples they used to assemble, would be king of all Egypt.

09:49.240 --> 09:58.920
Now what I found interesting about this text is the division between the 12 tribes, if you will,

09:58.920 --> 10:03.280
of the ruling class of Egypt at this time, and it makes you wonder,

10:03.280 --> 10:12.120
could this be some of the source material used for the curation of the 12 tribes in the story in Genesis?

10:12.120 --> 10:16.200
The 12 districts itself wouldn't be too convincing,

10:16.200 --> 10:26.120
but when you take a look at El or Yahweh, being a god of metallurgy and craftsmanship,

10:26.120 --> 10:30.440
and the uncreated one, like Patah, there's might be some connection here.

10:30.440 --> 10:48.440
Patah is an Egyptian deity responsible for creating the world, manifesting it through

10:48.440 --> 10:57.560
potent force of spoken words. A hymn from Egypt's 22nd dynasty praises Patah for shaping the world

10:57.640 --> 11:06.200
with the vision of his hearts. Meanwhile, the Shabakha stone, originating from the 25th dynasty,

11:06.200 --> 11:13.960
mentions Patah bestowed life upon all deities and their spirits using his heart in his voice,

11:14.920 --> 11:21.800
the curation by the voice, something we see in the god of the Old Testament. His worship then moved

11:21.800 --> 11:27.720
beyond the borders of Egypt, all the way into Syria, and was exported throughout the eastern

11:27.720 --> 11:33.800
Mediterranean. Through dissemination by the Phoenicians, we find figures of Patah and Carthage,

11:33.800 --> 11:39.800
his epithets, Patah, the begetter of the first beginning, Patah, Lord of Truth,

11:39.800 --> 11:47.160
Patah, Lord of Eternity, one who listens to prayers, master of ceremonies, master of justice,

11:47.160 --> 11:52.280
the god who made himself to be God, the double being, the beautiful face.

11:53.560 --> 11:59.240
Now, some of you watching this right now may be familiar with the Heliopolis in Aeneid,

11:59.240 --> 12:05.960
and the creation myths that say that Amun, or Atum, is the self-created craftsman

12:05.960 --> 12:12.680
who created the other gods. And though this is certainly true, the priesthood in Memphis and

12:12.680 --> 12:21.960
Crocodopolis and the elephantines have competing mythologies that make Patah the self-created

12:22.520 --> 12:31.720
demiurge who creates the other gods and humans. An elephantine, Cunum, who like Patah, is also

12:31.720 --> 12:38.840
depicted as a craftsman or demiurge with the potter's wheel behind him, just as Patah has

12:38.920 --> 12:44.440
images of himself with the potter's wheel behind him, as he creates gods and humans alike.

12:52.920 --> 12:58.360
Porphyry once said, At the city of Elephantine, there is an image worshiped, which in other

12:58.360 --> 13:05.240
respects is fashioned in the likeness of a man and sitting. It is of a blue color and has a man's

13:05.240 --> 13:13.480
head and a diadem bearing the horns of a goat. He sits with a vessel of clay beside him, on which

13:13.480 --> 13:19.400
he is molding the figure of a man, and from having the face of a ram and the horns of a goat,

13:19.400 --> 13:28.200
he indicates the conjunction of sun and moon, ra and ya, in the sign of the ram, Amun, while the

13:28.200 --> 13:35.880
color of blue indicates that the moon in that conjunction brings rain, Tefnut. He goes on to say,

13:36.680 --> 13:44.760
in the mysteries of Eleusis, the Hierophant is dressed up to represent the demiurge and the

13:44.760 --> 13:52.280
torchbearer, the sun, the priest at the altar, the moon, and the sacred herald, Hermes. Moreover,

13:52.280 --> 13:57.960
a man is admitted by the Egyptians among their objects of worship, for there is a village in

13:57.960 --> 14:05.240
Egypt called Anibis, in which a man is worshiped and sacrifice offered to him, and the victims

14:05.240 --> 14:10.920
burned upon his altars, and after a little while, he would eat the things that had been prepared for

14:10.920 --> 14:17.720
him as for a man. They did not, however, believe the animals to be gods, but regarded them as

14:17.720 --> 14:23.560
likenesses and symbols of gods, and this is shown by the fact that in many places,

14:23.560 --> 14:29.400
oxen dedicated to the gods are sacrificed at their monthly festivals and in their religious

14:29.400 --> 14:34.440
services, for they consecrated oxen to the sun and moon.

14:37.560 --> 14:44.360
What I find the most striking about this passage is his comparison to the Eleusinian priests,

14:44.360 --> 14:51.400
Abakus and Demeter, Na'kunum, who Pharaoh Khufu was named after, the famed builder of the Great

14:51.400 --> 14:59.000
Pyramid, Giza. Almost seems like a perfect synchronization between the competing creator gods

14:59.560 --> 15:05.480
Amun Ra and Patah. Patah is one of the three major gods of the Memphis Triad,

15:06.120 --> 15:13.000
along with Sekhmet, and he's also the father of Nefertim, and Kunum has an almost identical role

15:13.560 --> 15:19.560
within the Elephantine Triad. The temple of Elephantine was dedicated to Kunum, his consort

15:19.560 --> 15:26.520
Saitis and their daughter Anuket. Elephantine is the city where dozens of Jewish Aramaic texts were

15:26.520 --> 15:35.080
found, that not only physically predate every fragment or manuscript of Hebrew Bible in existence,

15:35.080 --> 15:44.520
I repeat, the Elephantine city where we found older Jewish Aramaic fragments than any

15:45.320 --> 15:53.000
existing fragment or manuscript of the Hebrew Bible in existence. But also, it shows that the

15:53.000 --> 16:00.360
Jews at Elephantine in the 4th and 5th century BCE were still polytheistic during this time.

16:00.360 --> 16:08.520
Following the 587 BCE destruction of Jerusalem, some Judean refugees traveled south in what may be

16:08.520 --> 16:18.520
called an Exodus in reverse, settled at Elephantine. They maintained their own temple, the House of Yahweh,

16:19.400 --> 16:26.440
or Yahoo in this case, in which sacrifices were offered, evincing polytheistic beliefs

16:27.320 --> 16:34.840
functioning alongside that of Kunum. Gods like Osiris and Isis are all over the place in these texts.

16:35.640 --> 16:42.680
The temple was destroyed in 410 BCE at the instigation of the priests of Kunum.

16:43.560 --> 16:49.880
So, what happened? Was Yahweh in direct competition with Kunum over who is the true

16:49.880 --> 16:57.960
divine craftsman? Possibly. One of the most common attributes among these metal-ergy

16:57.960 --> 17:04.840
craftsmen gods like Hephaestus of the Greeks, Ta of the Egyptians, and Vulcan of the Romans,

17:05.480 --> 17:12.200
is their connection to volcanoes and mountains due to the richness of metal ores found at these

17:12.200 --> 17:19.160
places. It is very possible that Yahweh is no exception, although he is from an entirely different location.

17:20.120 --> 17:30.760
In Exodus, the presence of fire and smoke is paired with the mountains quaking.

17:31.800 --> 17:38.440
These tremblings, akin to small earthquakes, are typical of volcanic eruptions,

17:39.320 --> 17:46.760
leading to the expulsion of warm gases from the cracks. This expulsion is accompanied by a

17:46.760 --> 17:53.880
significant sound, referred to in the Sinai Theophany as powerful shofar sound.

18:17.240 --> 18:24.280
Yahweh's revelation is always at a mountain, whether called Sinai or Horib, the event pictured

18:24.280 --> 18:30.760
like a volcanic eruption. As these texts show, volcanism seems to be an essential attribute,

18:30.760 --> 18:37.880
typically associated with Yahweh, linking him to the Kressman metal-ergy gods as I mentioned before.

18:37.880 --> 18:44.600
The account of the Sinai revelation, with its volcanic imagery, is meant to show that Yahweh

18:44.600 --> 19:01.160
himself is not just his divine emissary, but a demiurgic craftsman. Some believe Mount Sinai

19:01.160 --> 19:07.960
might be one of these Arabian volcanoes, which the Israelites approached in the text when departing

19:07.960 --> 19:15.240
Egypt. Jacob Dunn even theorized that Yahweh was once an Arabian volcanic deity. This ties

19:15.240 --> 19:22.840
into the theory that Yahweh's worship in Israel has Midianite roots. This theory draws from biblical

19:22.840 --> 19:30.840
references that depicts Moses' introduction to Yahweh in Midian. Near the mountain of God,

19:31.480 --> 19:40.280
close to Jethro's residence, in Exodus 3, 1-6, here Moses is instructed by God to bring the

19:40.280 --> 19:49.000
Israelites after their Egyptian Exodus, Exodus 312. Intriguingly, Moses' father-in-law is portrayed

19:49.000 --> 19:58.040
as a Midianite priest, suggesting Moses might have adopted local religious beliefs from him.

19:59.000 --> 20:06.760
In other passages, Moses' father-in-law is identified as a Kenite. Some Kenites settled

20:06.760 --> 20:13.080
in Israelite lands and maintained a close alliance with them. The biblical figure Cain,

20:13.640 --> 20:19.880
considered the Kenites founding ancestor, is significant in early biblical narratives,

20:19.880 --> 20:26.920
highlighting this group's ancient proximity to Yahweh. Cain's role as the initial person

20:26.920 --> 20:38.120
offered to Yahweh in Genesis 4-3 reinforces this notion. While Yahweh's association with the Midianites

20:38.120 --> 20:46.360
might explain Israelites using volcanic imagery to depict the divine presence, linking Yahweh

20:46.360 --> 20:53.640
to the Kenites prompts a reevaluation, especially considering the Kenites'

20:53.640 --> 20:55.560
metal-urgical pursuits.

21:04.200 --> 21:12.440
The Kenites seem to have been skilled metalworkers. Genesis 4 discusses Cain's descendant,

21:12.440 --> 21:20.440
Tubel Cain, as a craftsman skilled in molding copper and iron. Semitic cognates of Cain hint

21:20.520 --> 21:28.440
that metal-urgical activities were integral to its meaning. Hence, Cain might originally have been

21:28.440 --> 21:36.840
represented the pioneering figure in metalurgy with the Kenites, both metalworkers and smelters,

21:37.480 --> 21:45.960
as his successors. Their association with the volcanic deity, like Yahweh, becomes clear in

21:45.960 --> 21:53.400
this context. Historically, deities linked to metalurgy were also connected with volcanoes.

21:53.960 --> 22:00.280
For instance, Hephaestus was linked to Mount Etna in ancient Greece, and the term volcano

22:00.920 --> 22:07.880
originates from the Roman god of metalurgy, Vulcan. The connection between volcanoes and

22:07.880 --> 22:13.880
metal smelting is straightforward. Both release similar owners and plumes of smoke.

22:14.840 --> 22:21.080
In past times, smelting was the sole human activity involved in melting stones,

22:21.800 --> 22:30.200
lava pouring from volcano, mirror slag from a furnace, which once solidified resembles volcanic

22:30.200 --> 22:39.080
rock. This similarity is evident in Exodus' description of the Sinai Revelation, comparing

22:39.080 --> 22:49.320
the ascending smoke to that of a furnace, Exodus 1918. The persistent use of volcanic imagery

22:49.320 --> 22:57.000
when describing Yahweh implies a deep-rooted metal-urgical aspect to his earlier identity.

22:58.200 --> 23:06.280
Notably, the Song of Deborah associates Yahweh near Ereba's copper mines. This volcanic aspect

23:06.280 --> 23:12.840
of divine revelation is also highlighted in Deuteronomy's account of the Horeb Revelation.

23:13.640 --> 23:18.680
It notes that Yahweh communicated from amidst fire and smoke,

23:19.720 --> 23:23.880
essentially from the volcano's core, while it erupted.

23:25.800 --> 23:33.480
Oh Yahweh, when you came forth from Sire, advanced from the country of Edom, the earth trembled,

23:33.480 --> 23:40.680
the heavens dripped, yea, the clouds dripped water, the mountains quaked or flowed before

23:40.680 --> 23:45.800
Yahweh, the one of Sinai before Yahweh, God of Israel.

23:48.680 --> 23:55.080
The writings in Zechariah support this idea. The book starts by sternly rebuking the earlier

23:55.080 --> 24:01.640
prophets of Israel, accusing them of abandoning the paths of Yahweh and ignoring his call.

24:02.600 --> 24:09.800
Zechariah 1, 4-6, this assertion is further elaborated when the text predicts the arrival

24:09.800 --> 24:20.280
of four rescuers, dispatched by Yahweh, referenced as Smiths, and Zechariah 2, 3-4, Smiths,

24:20.280 --> 24:28.920
and subsequent revelation, Zechariah 6, 1-5. Zechariah witnesses four soaring chariots,

24:29.720 --> 24:34.600
representing the four winds, originating from the bronze mountains.

24:35.720 --> 24:41.800
This terminology alludes to the copper mining regions, like Ereba and Sinai,

24:42.520 --> 24:49.960
hinting at Yahweh's earlier residence. Thus, even in Zechariah's time, there were those who

24:49.960 --> 24:53.560
recalled Yahweh's association with metalurgy.

25:02.840 --> 25:10.120
Recognizing Yahweh's historical role as the deity overseeing metalurgy in the Southern Levant,

25:10.920 --> 25:20.520
sheds light on various aspects of his biblical character. In fact, Yahweh is nowhere to be found

25:20.520 --> 25:29.000
in any of the Ugaritic or Northern Canaanite texts or inscriptions, which are dominated by El

25:29.000 --> 25:36.280
and Bell. As well as different craftsmen God, Kothar Wachasus, who I mentioned earlier,

25:36.840 --> 25:43.960
who is identified with Ptah in texts that survive from Memphis, as well as Anki of the Babylonians.

25:44.920 --> 25:52.600
So, Yahweh is most likely local to the Southern Levant, near the Sinai Desert and Midian.

25:55.000 --> 26:04.760
In Isaiah 31-9, an oracle of Yahweh, whose fire is in Zion, in his furnace in Jerusalem,

26:06.760 --> 26:14.520
imagery of metalurgy undeniable here surrounding Yahweh. This could also help explain the biblical

26:14.520 --> 26:22.440
author's attempts to polemicize Bell as an evil opposition to Yahweh, considering how popular

26:22.440 --> 26:30.280
Bell was to northern Israel, and being the prince and son of El. He only has to be opposed by Yahweh.

26:30.280 --> 26:37.640
While many view this portrayal as merely a symbolic expression without deeper theological

26:37.640 --> 26:45.080
meaning, considering the other metallic attributes associated with Yahweh, it probably reveals

26:45.080 --> 26:52.040
a metallurgical facet to Yahweh's worship in Jerusalem. In this perspective, the numerous

26:52.040 --> 26:59.240
metal artifacts in the Jerusalem Temple aren't just symbols of grandeur. Their context largely

26:59.240 --> 27:05.640
details an exodus via the depiction of the Tabernacle. It specifies about the metals used,

27:05.640 --> 27:11.560
hint at deeper theological importance they held. They symbolize the heavenly furnace

27:12.120 --> 27:19.480
within the Israelite sanctuary, turning it into the earthly abode of the Israelite deity. Moreover,

27:20.040 --> 27:27.960
the copperclad altar in the Temple's grounds lends a metallurgical undertone to the sacrifices.

27:27.960 --> 27:35.880
The glow from this copper surface, when heated to nearly 1000 Celsius, for the burning sacrifices,

27:36.520 --> 27:40.920
is reminiscent of the luminance of liquefied copper or gold.

27:47.000 --> 27:52.760
The beginning of the Prophet Ezekiel's vision recounts his entrance into the heavenly realm

27:52.760 --> 27:59.720
as follows. And I looked and behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud

28:00.360 --> 28:07.160
with a fire flashing up and brightness around it, and in its midst, something like Hasmal,

28:07.880 --> 28:14.040
out of the midst of the fire. The vision illustrates Hasmal, an entity radiating

28:14.040 --> 28:20.760
powerful luminance amidst celestial flames. This unique term is exclusively found in Ezekiel's

28:20.760 --> 28:27.880
revelation within the Bible. However, comparable words appear in both Egyptian and Akkadian,

28:28.440 --> 28:35.480
Hashmen and Hashmalu, referring to an amber or yellowish-orange metal or metallic mixture.

28:36.360 --> 28:42.680
The Septuagint translates it as helectron, signifying either amber or electron,

28:43.720 --> 28:49.400
a natural blend of gold and silver. While many translations peg Hashmel as amber,

28:50.040 --> 28:55.560
this interpretation doesn't quite fit, given the reference to the glowing embers within the flame.

28:56.520 --> 29:03.800
In Ezekiel 1.13, it's more likely that Hashmel alludes to something shining brilliantly due to

29:03.800 --> 29:12.040
high heat, considering that burning amber emits smoke but not light. It stands to reason that

29:12.040 --> 29:17.800
Ezekiel 1. Hashmal is more likely a representation of liquefied metal.

29:23.640 --> 29:29.000
When they moved, I could hear the sound of their wings like the sound of mighty waters,

29:29.000 --> 29:37.320
like the sound of Shaddai, a tumult like the din of an army. In Ezekiel's depiction of these beings

29:38.280 --> 29:45.640
and their movement, it seems he's detailing the powerful gusts that fuel the celestial furnace,

29:45.640 --> 29:52.680
enhancing the creation of shining embers. Essentially, this vision portrays Yahweh's

29:52.680 --> 30:00.440
divine realm as a massive kiln encircling by winged entities that drive the air current

30:00.520 --> 30:07.160
akin to bellows. Taking into account both Ezekiel's imagery and Isaiah's analogy,

30:07.160 --> 30:12.520
it becomes clear that these prophetic insights symbolize Yahweh's manifestation

30:13.080 --> 30:18.520
in both the celestial and terrestrial realms through the imagery of a colossal furnace.

30:19.080 --> 30:24.600
This emphasizes the strong ties of his worship to the world of metallurgy.

30:25.400 --> 30:31.720
The oldest plausible occurrence of his name is in the Egyptian land of Sashu Yahweh,

30:31.720 --> 30:41.320
an inscription from the time of Amenhotep 3rd, 1390-1352 B.C. The Shasu, being nomads from Midian.

30:42.120 --> 30:50.600
Yes, Midian, there you go again, and Edom in Northern Arabia. This gives the Yahweh as a Midian God,

30:50.600 --> 30:55.880
way more plausibility. When we look at the Greek sources like Herodotus and Plutarch,

30:55.880 --> 31:01.080
for which gods are worshiped in this region, they both claim that it's Dionysus and Venus

31:01.080 --> 31:04.840
that are the main gods worshipped here. One might immediately dismiss this

31:05.480 --> 31:13.480
due to the blatant differences between Greek Dionysus and Yahweh. However, the Bronze Age

31:13.480 --> 31:20.680
Dionysian religion was so widespread and his worship flourished from Turkey down to Egypt

31:20.680 --> 31:25.960
along the Mediterranean. So if Yahweh was connected to this ancient god in any way,

31:26.840 --> 31:31.960
he would almost barely resemble him anymore by the time of antiquity. It's possible that Yahweh

31:31.960 --> 31:39.880
could be a metallurgy volcano god with Dionysian attributes. For example, figures like Tacitus,

31:39.880 --> 31:47.320
John the Lydian, Varro draw parallels between Yahweh and Bacchus Dionysus. Often Jews employed

31:47.320 --> 31:56.200
symbols commonly linked to Dionysus, including chylixes, amphorae, ivy leaves, and grape clusters.

31:56.200 --> 32:02.440
Plutarch highlighted these resemblances to argue that the Jews venerated a version of Bacchus

32:02.440 --> 32:09.720
Dionysus. In Plutarch's questions in Moralia, he points out that Jews praised their deity

32:09.720 --> 32:16.120
using the exclamations Iwa Sabao, chants that are typically related to Dionysus.

32:39.880 --> 33:03.000
This is just many of the hundreds of Dionysian imagery that is found throughout the Hebrew

33:03.000 --> 33:08.360
Bible, including the fact that the temple was designed with golden vines and golden grape

33:08.360 --> 33:14.600
clusters throughout the sanctuary designed by Solomon, with golden satyrs who are the race of

33:14.600 --> 33:21.720
daemons that are led by Dionysus to battle. In the ancient Greek text, many biblical parallels

33:21.720 --> 33:27.480
and allegories are associated with the vine. The children of Israel are referred to as a vine

33:28.040 --> 33:35.400
in Isaiah 5-7 and in Isaiah 9-10, Isaiah likens God as the owner of a vineyard,

33:35.400 --> 33:41.480
and Israel is the vineyard. The grapevine is one of the seven species with which the land of

33:41.480 --> 33:48.920
Israel was blessed. Deuteronomy 8-8, an ample supply of wine symbolized prosperity and well-being,

33:48.920 --> 33:56.040
and overflowing that symbolized divine blessing. Every man under his vine and under his fig tree

33:56.760 --> 34:02.920
symbolizes the idealized past and hope for a future peace. Threats of national disaster

34:02.920 --> 34:08.040
were couched in terms of laying waste to the nation's vines and fig trees.

34:08.040 --> 34:16.520
Hosea 2-14, Joel 1-7, the vines in blossom symbolized the passing of winter. Song of Songs 2-13,

34:16.520 --> 34:24.920
and the ripening of fruit represented a fulfilled state of being, Joel 2-22. Although the fruit

34:24.920 --> 34:31.720
of the vine was eaten fresh or dried, the plant was primarily valued for its fermented juice,

34:31.720 --> 34:37.560
which was considered an appropriate gift of royalty. A description of Israelite culture

34:37.560 --> 34:43.720
is provided by Isaiah and his parable concerning a vineyard. Let me sing for my beloved. A song

34:43.720 --> 34:50.360
of my beloved about his vineyard. My beloved had a vineyard on a fruitful hill. He broke the ground,

34:50.360 --> 34:57.640
cleared it of stones, and planted it with choice vines. He built a watchtower inside it. He hewed

34:57.640 --> 35:09.320
a winepress in it, Isaiah 5-1-2. Many ancient depictions of Dionysus are shown as a man riding

35:09.320 --> 35:14.680
a donkey, according to multiple sources, one of them which includes Manacias of Rhodes, who claims

35:14.680 --> 35:21.880
that Antiochus IV raided the temple of Jerusalem, found within the Holy of Holies a golden donkey

35:22.440 --> 35:29.320
with a man riding on it. According to Tacitus, when Pompey the Great raided the temple of Jerusalem,

35:29.320 --> 35:36.520
all he found within the Holy of Holies was a golden ivy diadem, a symbol of none other

35:36.520 --> 35:43.560
than Dionysus Bacchus. A coin was released by Pompey to commemorate his triumph over Judea,

35:44.200 --> 35:51.240
which displayed a bearded individual on his knees holding a branch with the caption Bacchus

35:51.240 --> 35:59.480
Judeus. This can be translated as either the Jewish Bacchus or Bacchus from Judea. Some interpret

35:59.480 --> 36:05.560
this figure as representing Yahweh as a regional version of Bacchus or Dionysus. However, considering

36:05.560 --> 36:10.920
such coin designs usually showcase subjugated individuals, rather than the deities of the

36:10.920 --> 36:17.000
conquered, others believe it might symbolize a Judean whose name was Bacchus. This figure is

36:17.000 --> 36:24.200
sometimes thought to be the Hasmonean king Aristobelus II, whom Pompey defeated. Regardless,

36:24.200 --> 36:31.720
one of the many titles of Dionysus was Yaho or Yacus, and the Phrygians in the east called him

36:31.720 --> 36:41.000
Savatsios, a god who was later identified by Romans as Theos Hipsistos, which means god most high,

36:41.000 --> 36:50.120
the initial Jewish settlers in Rome faced expulsion in 139 BCE. Cornelius Hyspilus,

36:50.120 --> 36:56.440
acting under a law that forbade spreading the corruption of worship of Jupiter Savatsios,

36:56.440 --> 37:04.200
banished the Chaldean astrologers and the Jews. Nias Cornelius Hyspalus pray to our

37:04.200 --> 37:10.200
peregrinus in the year of the consulate of Marcus Populus Lannis and Lucius Calpurnius,

37:10.760 --> 37:17.160
ordered the astrologers by an edict to leave Rome and Italy within 10 days, since by a fallacious

37:17.160 --> 37:24.520
interpretation of the stars they perturbed fickle and silly minds, thereby making profit out of their

37:24.520 --> 37:30.920
lies. The same praetor compelled the Jews who attempted to infect the Roman custom with the

37:30.920 --> 37:39.800
cult of Jupiter Savasios to return to their homes. This action suggests that Romans possibly equated

37:39.800 --> 37:46.520
the Jewish Yahweh Tsavaot, meaning lord of hosts, with Job Savatsios.

37:46.520 --> 38:06.120
Plutarch posited that the Jews revered Dionysus and celebrated the Sabbath as a tribute to Savatsios.

38:06.120 --> 38:13.320
Additionally, he explored the idea of equating the Jewish god with the Egyptian entity Typhon,

38:13.960 --> 38:21.080
although he later dismissed this association. Meanwhile, the monotheistic Hypsasterians revered

38:21.080 --> 38:26.680
the most high using a name that might have been linked to the Jewish deity Herodotus,

38:27.240 --> 38:33.480
who, like I said, never mentions Israel or Jerusalem or Yahweh, does happen to describe

38:33.480 --> 38:41.240
a local religion somewhere between Mount Sinai and Phoenicia, possibly Midianite territory,

38:41.240 --> 38:47.000
who have a similar ritual as described in the Hebrew Bible, such as the priests wearing similar

38:47.000 --> 38:54.200
white and blue robes with golden tassels that are seen among priests of Dionysus and Demeter

38:54.200 --> 39:01.560
and Eleusis and the blood oath rites, which seem to look very similar to Leviticus blood oath rites.

39:02.200 --> 39:07.720
He is to dip his finger into the blood and sprinkle some of it seven times before the Lord

39:08.440 --> 39:14.760
in front of the curtain of the sanctuary. Now compare this to the right the Herodotus records

39:14.760 --> 39:20.440
among these local Arabians. There are no men who respect pledges more than the Arabians.

39:21.400 --> 39:28.440
This is how they give them. A man stands between two pledging parties and with a sharp stone cuts

39:28.440 --> 39:35.960
the palms of their hands near the thumb. Then he takes a piece of wood from the oak of each

39:35.960 --> 39:39.720
and smears with their blood seven stones that lie between them.

39:40.520 --> 39:47.800
Meanwhile, calling on Dionysus and the heavenly Aphrodite. In both cases, the blood is sprinkled

39:47.800 --> 40:02.760
or smeared exactly seven times to seal the oath. A painting on a jar found at Kuntalit

40:03.400 --> 40:09.960
under the inscription Yahweh of Samaria and his Asherah dated to 800 BCE, possibly the male

40:09.960 --> 40:15.640
and female pair that Herodotus thought was Dionysus and Aphrodite. In an inscription discovered in

40:15.640 --> 40:23.640
Iron Getty and dated around 700 BCE, Yahweh appears described as the Lord of the Nations.

40:23.640 --> 40:30.760
While in other contemporary texts discovered in Kierbet Laya near Lakish, he is mentioned as

40:30.760 --> 40:39.080
the ruler of Jerusalem and probably also of Judah Yahweh in the form of Yaho. It is frequently

40:39.080 --> 40:45.960
invoked in Greco-Roman magical texts dating from the 2nd century BCE to the 5th century of the

40:45.960 --> 40:54.760
Common Era, most notably in the Greek Magical Papyri under the names Yaho, Adonai, Sabaoth and

40:54.760 --> 41:02.600
Eloi. These are also used as Bacchic chants among Dionysian religious revelers at this time.

41:02.600 --> 41:10.200
Use of Yaho becomes blurred by the usage. Since the 2nd century BCE, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans

41:10.200 --> 41:17.480
had identified the evil god Seth Typhon, often depicted as a donkey-like creature with the Jewish

41:17.480 --> 41:25.320
god Yahweh. The Seth Yahweh tradition with all its negative valence was then applied to the

41:25.320 --> 41:32.440
Creator worshiped by the Christians as well. Evidence for this view comes from the early

41:32.440 --> 41:41.720
Christian depiction of the Creator and his sons in donkey or typhonian form, the oldest manuscripts

41:41.800 --> 41:48.840
of the Greek Septuagint, Old Testament in Greek, before the Church editions came in the 4th century

41:49.560 --> 41:59.800
show Yaho in them for Leviticus 327 and 427. These are replaced with the uniform Curios or Lord

42:00.360 --> 42:06.760
in the 4th century Church codexes of the Sinaiticus, Alexandricus, and Vaticanus.

42:07.400 --> 42:14.600
I think it is very possible that we have in Yahweh a warrior, Demiurgic craftsman,

42:14.600 --> 42:19.960
with ancient Bronze Age Dionysian elements passed down through the rites and traditions.

42:19.960 --> 42:26.840
Although much closer to something like Vulcan than of Dionysus, this Yahweh, the local craftsman

42:26.840 --> 42:34.520
metal-urgy god of the southern Levant, became infused with El, the chief god of the Canaanites,

42:34.520 --> 42:42.280
to become Yahweh Elohim. This also puts him in direct opposition to Baal, the prince and son of El

42:42.280 --> 42:44.200
in the northern Canaanite religion.

42:55.320 --> 43:00.040
For Canaanites in the broader Levantine region, El was the highest god,

43:00.040 --> 43:07.080
fathering notable gods like Baal and Yam. In Ugrit, El was married to the goddess Asherah,

43:07.080 --> 43:13.720
but no temple was dedicated solely to him. Numerous titles and attributes describe El

43:14.360 --> 43:21.800
from being a creator and king to a wise elder. Some myths feature him prominently, such as

43:22.600 --> 43:29.800
a tale where he encounters two women by the sea and fathers the deities of dawn and dusk.

43:31.080 --> 43:37.880
In an Ugritic story, El hosts a feast for the gods on Mount Lel, which may indicate

43:38.600 --> 43:47.160
he lived in a tent explaining his lack of a dedicated temple. This text also suggests

43:47.240 --> 43:54.360
he might have resided near sources of saltwater and freshwater in the text Palace of Baal story.

43:55.160 --> 44:01.800
Baal Haddad, commonly known as Dagon's son, is occasionally referred to as El's son,

44:02.840 --> 44:09.640
hinting at El's overarching authority over the gods. Another fragmentary text depicts El

44:09.640 --> 44:17.080
inviting gods to a banquet where he gets embarrassingly drunk, showcasing his human-like flaws

44:18.120 --> 44:26.120
Regarding the god El, he was seen as the preeminent deity residing atop the monumental Mount Saphon

44:26.920 --> 44:33.960
where all gods convened, similar to Mount Olympius. Ugritic texts referred to the collective gods

44:33.960 --> 44:42.360
as El's offspring, or all the gods to divine assembly. El was esteemed with titles such as

44:42.440 --> 44:49.560
creature maker, the monarch, the Baal El, and humanity's father. Even though royal attributes

44:49.560 --> 44:56.760
were primarily ascribed to El, he often came across as a figurehead, sometimes distant and

44:56.760 --> 45:04.440
inactive, resembling what experts termed far-off supreme deity, something like we see in Zoroastrianism

45:04.520 --> 45:11.720
with Zorvan. He lived in a celestial realm, termed the sources of the two deeps, where he

45:11.720 --> 45:18.840
attended to visitors and dispatched directives via envoys, imagined as a kind of elderly figure.

45:19.480 --> 45:26.680
El was sometimes named El the Benevolent. Eisfelt suggests that this particular characteristic

45:26.680 --> 45:32.680
might have influenced the Israelites to envision their god Yahweh with more compassionate traits.

45:32.680 --> 45:39.480
The name El likely stems from the root Yowl, meaning powerful or chief, and is believed to be

45:39.480 --> 45:44.520
a descriptive term, as referenced by W. F. Albright in his works.

45:54.520 --> 46:00.200
But the belief system of the Canaanites, a group of Semitic peoples from the ancient Levant,

46:00.760 --> 46:06.520
spanned from the early Bronze Age up to initial centuries of the common era.

46:06.520 --> 46:12.680
This religion was characterized by the worship of multiple deities and, in certain instances,

46:13.240 --> 46:19.400
the exclusive veneration of one god while acknowledging the existence of others. The

46:19.400 --> 46:27.960
Pantheon and Ugarit referred to the deities Elohim or El's descendants. Thilo of Biblos,

46:27.960 --> 46:33.800
in the first century, Phoenician writer, who cited Sakoniethin of Beirut,

46:33.800 --> 46:39.640
priest from the Bronze Age apparently, identified the chief creator god as Elian.

46:39.640 --> 46:46.200
He was considered the progenitor of other gods. Greek records mention his union with Beirut,

46:46.840 --> 46:53.720
symbolizing the city of Beirut. Such divine city unions can also be drawn parallel with

46:53.720 --> 47:04.520
Melkart and Tyre, Kamash and Moab, Tanit and Balhaman in Carthage, and Yah with Jerusalem.

47:04.520 --> 47:12.360
El-Eliyan's relationship with Asherah can be likened to the Greek tales of Kronos and Reia,

47:13.080 --> 47:16.440
or the myths of Saturn and Ops.

47:16.680 --> 47:28.600
At about this time, the descendants of the Dioscary put together rafts and ships,

47:28.600 --> 47:35.560
and made voyages, and, being cast ashore near Mount Cassius, consecrated a temple there,

47:35.560 --> 47:43.080
and the allies of El, who is Kronos, were surnamed Elohim, as these same were surnamed

47:43.160 --> 47:50.040
after Kronos, what have been called Kroni. It was a custom of the ancients in great crisis

47:50.040 --> 47:56.520
of danger for the rulers of a city or nation in order to avert the common ruin to give up the

47:56.520 --> 48:02.520
most beloved of their children for sacrifice as a ransom to the avenging daemons, and those

48:02.520 --> 48:09.640
who were thus given up were sacrificed with mystic rites. Kronos then, who the Phoenicians

48:09.640 --> 48:16.760
call El, who was king of the country subsequently after his disease, was deified as the star Saturn,

48:17.480 --> 48:24.040
and had by a nymph of the country named Anna Brett, an only begotten son, whom they call on

48:24.040 --> 48:29.800
this account, Ye dude, the only begotten, still so called among the Phoenicians,

48:30.920 --> 48:37.800
and when very great dangers from war had beset the country, he arrayed his son in royal apparel,

48:38.520 --> 48:45.160
prepared an altar, and sacrificed him. Kronos also, in going around the world,

48:45.960 --> 48:52.200
gives the kingdom of Attica to his own daughter Athena, but on the occurrence of a pestilence

48:52.200 --> 48:59.960
and mortality, Kronos offers his only begotten son, as a whole burnt offering to his father Orinos,

49:00.040 --> 49:08.280
that circumcises himself, compelling his allies to do the same. This has obvious parallels to the

49:08.280 --> 49:16.040
story of Abraham, sacrificing his son Isaac on the altar. But then being stopped at the last minute,

49:16.040 --> 49:22.600
which is the polemic against the old ways, the story of Abraham is an obvious euhemerization

49:22.600 --> 49:28.040
of the text about El and Kronos, and archaeologists and Canaanite scholars

49:28.680 --> 49:34.760
claim that the practice of child sacrifice was rampant among Canaanites in the first millennium

49:34.760 --> 49:40.760
BC, as is clear from the frequent biblical allusions, as well as from the fact that tested

49:40.760 --> 49:46.360
by Roman witnesses that the Carthaginians were migrated from Phoenicia in the 9th and 8th century

49:46.360 --> 49:53.640
BC, practiced human sacrifice on a large scale. Down to the fall of Carthage, the root of this

49:53.640 --> 50:00.760
practice in Punic religion is illustrated by the fact that it had not seized by the 3rd century

50:00.760 --> 50:07.480
of the common era. Despite repeated Roman efforts to wipe it out, the Babylonians also

50:07.480 --> 50:14.680
practice this due to the ritual of dressing sacrifice victim in royal purple to imitate a

50:14.680 --> 50:21.800
substitute king and slaying them in public square. Our best source occurrences are the archaeological

50:21.800 --> 50:32.680
remains from the royal death pits at early dynastic Ur from 2600 to 2500 BCE, and textual records of the

50:32.680 --> 50:38.440
substitute king ritual that was practiced at least from the early 2nd millennium BCE,

50:39.240 --> 50:45.960
down to the time of Alexander the Great. These rituals were known and practiced far and wide,

50:46.520 --> 50:52.040
and El, who was also called Cronos, was at the center of these.

50:59.560 --> 51:04.920
Again, would it not have been far better for the Carthaginians to have taken Critias or

51:04.920 --> 51:11.800
Diagoras to draw up their law code at the very beginning, and so not to believe in any divine

51:11.880 --> 51:18.360
power or god rather than to offer such sacrifices as they used to offer to Cronos.

51:20.680 --> 51:27.240
With us, for instance, human sacrifice is not legal but unholy, whereas the Carthaginians

51:27.240 --> 51:32.920
perform it as a thing they account wholly and legal, and that too when some of them sacrifice

51:32.920 --> 51:38.520
even their own sons to Cronos, as I daresay you yourselves have heard.

51:39.080 --> 51:47.560
And from then on to the present day they perform human sacrifices with the participation of all,

51:47.560 --> 51:53.640
not only in Arcadia during the Laikeia and in Carthage to Cronos, but also periodically

51:53.640 --> 51:59.480
in remembrance of the customary usage. They spill the blood of their own kin on the altars,

51:59.480 --> 52:05.640
even though the divine law among them bars from the rites, by means of Perahenterra,

52:05.640 --> 52:12.200
and the herald's proclamation anyone responsible for shedding of blood in peacetime.

52:14.120 --> 52:21.080
Was chosen as a sacrifice for the city, for from ancient times the barbarians have had a custom

52:21.080 --> 52:23.960
of sacrificing human beings to Cronos.

52:24.680 --> 52:38.360
In Leviticus 1821, in Deuteronomy 1230, the Torah contains a number of in-laws forbidding child

52:38.360 --> 52:46.200
sacrifice and human sacrifice in general. The Tanakh denounces human sacrifice as barbaric

52:46.200 --> 52:53.560
customs of Baal worshippers. For example, Psalm 106-37, this is another example of the

52:53.560 --> 52:58.840
biblical authors detaching themselves from the past of ancient Israel. It is impossible to

52:58.840 --> 53:05.960
reconstruct some of the details of Canaanite ritual from references in the Old Testament.

53:05.960 --> 53:14.440
1 Kings 18 describes the contest of Elijah, the prophets of Baal, on the summit of Mount Caramel.

53:14.440 --> 53:21.080
The latter are said to have leaped about the altar, to have cut themselves after their manner

53:21.080 --> 53:28.040
with knives and lances, till the blood gushed out upon them. The gashing with knives is found in

53:28.040 --> 53:34.600
the description of El's mourning of the dead Baal, as well as in the writings of Lucian of

53:34.600 --> 53:42.360
Samosota in the 2nd century, whose states that the custom was characteristic of the ceremonial

53:42.360 --> 53:51.560
mourning of Adonis, which was performed annually at the Syrian sanctuary in Hierapolis, also known as

53:51.560 --> 54:05.480
the Holy City. Moloch, sometimes written as Molech, was a Canaanite god mentioned in the

54:05.480 --> 54:12.760
biblical accounts with child sacrifice. The name combines the consonants from the Hebrew word

54:12.760 --> 54:20.280
Melch, meaning king, with the vowels from Boshet, meaning shame. In the Old Testament,

54:20.280 --> 54:27.560
Boshet is often used as an alternative name for the widely recognized god Bael, who translates to

54:27.640 --> 54:35.480
Lord. Moloch is also depicted in the Septuagint in Amos 6, with the star god Rhefane.

54:45.800 --> 54:53.320
In the Hebrew, it's Sikkoth and Chion, instead of Moloch and Rhefane. This text directly connects

54:53.320 --> 55:00.440
Saturn with Moloch in the following way. Sikkoth is a celestial god, recognized from the

55:00.440 --> 55:08.200
on-god list discovered at Ugarit, originally sourced from Nippur and various Mesopotamian

55:08.200 --> 55:16.120
origins. Here, it's represented as Ninerta, who is the principal deity in Mesopotamian culture

55:16.120 --> 55:22.440
that is associated with this planet Saturn, and also acknowledged in the West and occasionally

55:22.520 --> 55:29.400
equated with the god Horon, a god worshiped by the Samaritans. The name Sikkoth in Amos

55:29.400 --> 55:37.080
precisely echoes this star god's name. Its title being Melch, or king, suggests the deity's prominent

55:37.080 --> 55:43.240
status. It becomes the god Moloch in the biblical text. This indicates that Sikkoth holds the highest

55:43.240 --> 55:52.120
significance in the ritual mentioned by Amos. Meanwhile, Chion correlates with the Akkadian term

55:52.200 --> 56:00.520
Kajmanu, denoting the steadfast, the steady one, which is a reference to the star god Horon,

56:00.520 --> 56:06.280
who is also equated with Sikkoth, is considered one of the most attested deities of the ancient

56:06.280 --> 56:12.520
sources who shows up in text from the southernmost ends of Egypt all the way up to Turkey. He is

56:12.520 --> 56:20.920
considered a god of healing, drugs, magic, forbidden knowledge, and doom. A possible forerunner to the

56:20.920 --> 56:28.360
serpent in the garden, adding yet another layer of ancient deities that get polemicized in the

56:28.360 --> 56:35.560
biblical text. In the Hebrew scriptures, Moloch is depicted as a foreign god who occasionally found

56:35.560 --> 56:42.680
a foothold in Israel's religious practices due to the adoption of synchronistic beliefs by some

56:42.680 --> 56:50.280
of the unfaithful kings. The divine commandments given to Moses explicitly prohibited the Jews

56:50.280 --> 56:56.840
from engaging in the practices of the Egyptians or Canaanites. The edict stated,

56:57.560 --> 57:05.000
you shall not sacrifice any of your children in fire to Moloch, thereby defiling the name of your

57:05.000 --> 57:15.160
god, Leviticus 1821. Yet it is documented that influence kings like Ahaz and 2 Kings 16 and

57:15.160 --> 57:25.960
Manessa, 2 Kings 21, under Assyrian sway, paid homage to Moloch at Tofeth, a hilly area just

57:25.960 --> 57:33.880
outside Jerusalem. While this site thrived under the leadership of Manesh's son, King Omnon, it was

57:33.880 --> 57:41.400
eradicated during King Josiah's rule, who was known for his religious reforms. He is quoted,

57:42.040 --> 57:48.280
he desecrated Tofeth in the valley of Benhenom, so no one could use it to sacrifice their son or

57:48.280 --> 58:05.960
daughter in the fire to Moloch, 2 Kings 2310. In Canaanite tales, two mountains,

58:05.960 --> 58:15.080
Targitzi and Therimagi, support the sky and enclose the terrestrial ocean. W. F. Albright

58:15.080 --> 58:20.600
suggests that the term El Shaddai stems from a Semitic origin found in the cating words

58:21.240 --> 58:28.760
Shadu, meaning mountain, and Shadau, translating as mountain dweller. This associates with one of

58:28.760 --> 58:37.320
the Amurus names. Philo of Biblos also claims that Atlas was an Elohim, just as he is a Titan

58:37.320 --> 58:42.840
in the Greek text, aligning with El Shaddai's mountain god interpretation. Harriet Lutzky

58:42.840 --> 58:51.160
offers another viewpoint, linking Shaddai with the Hebrew word sad, meaning breast. This suggests

58:51.160 --> 58:57.320
a connection with the Semitic goddess, posits the twin mountains as symbolic breasts of the earth,

58:58.200 --> 59:05.480
dual mountain themes are recurrent in Canaanite lore, similar to Horib and Sinai from the Bible.

59:05.480 --> 59:10.280
Their religious beliefs of the Canaanites were shaped by their geographical location,

59:10.920 --> 59:16.920
nestled between Egypt and Mesopotamia. These neighboring regions significantly impacted

59:16.920 --> 59:24.280
Canaanite spirituality. For instance, during the role of the chariot rhyoning Mariano in

59:24.360 --> 59:33.480
Egypt's Hyksos era, Baal began to be linked with the Egyptian deity Set, especially Set's Setaka form.

59:34.440 --> 59:41.160
From that point on, Baal's depictions included the crown of lower Egypt and a distinct Egyptian

59:41.160 --> 59:49.640
posture. Likewise, deities like Athoret, later known as Ashura and Anat, started being illustrated

59:49.640 --> 59:56.360
with Egyptian wigs reminiscent of Hathor or Isis. From another perspective,

59:57.160 --> 01:00:03.720
Jean Batarro proposed that Yah of Ebla, potentially a precursor to Yam,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:12.120
god of the sea, was aligned with the Mesopotamian god Ia during the rule of the Akkadian empire.

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:16.200
The Canaanite faith in the middle and late Bronze Age

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:24.760
showed evident influences from the Hurrians and Mitonites. The Hurrian goddess Hibat found devotees

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:32.520
in Jerusalem, while Baal was often equated with the Hurrian storm deity Teshub and Hittite storm god

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:40.600
Tarhunt. When compared to the neighboring Eastern Arameans, the nature and roles of Canaanite gods

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:49.240
seemed remarkably similar. Early Amorite invaders of Mesopotamia previously recognized deities like

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:55.560
Baal Haddad and El. Phoenician sailors spread Canaanite religious beliefs to the west,

01:00:56.280 --> 01:01:03.080
leaving imprints on Greek mythology. This can be seen in the division of power among the

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:13.400
Olympian gods Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. Reflecting Hittite, Canaanites, Syrian divisions among Baal,

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:20.760
Yam, Moth, or Marduk, and Nenerta. Additionally, Hercules labors echo the tales of the Tyrian

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:33.080
Melkhart, who was frequently likened to Hercules. If we bring our attention back to the Elephantine

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:41.080
Jews living in Egypt in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE, we notice that Judaism at this time is still

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:50.360
polytheistic. The majority of the Aramaic fragments show either Jov, Yahu, or Kunum as the major head

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:57.720
of the pantheon, but some, like this Aramaic text, Carpentra Stella says,

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:28.440
In the top part of the stele, the Egyptian god of the underworld, Osiris sits on the throne,

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:36.280
recognizable with his characteristic crook and flail. Behind him is a goddess dressed in a long

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:43.320
skirt, could be Isis or Moth. The table, a lady perhaps, the deceased stands with her arms raised,

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:50.360
an adoration pose. In the lower image, the deceased is shown lying on a lying bed.

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:58.760
The embalming god Anubis is shown, assisted by the falcon god Horus. The four canopic jugs with

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:04.840
the entrails of the deceased are under the bed, with lids likely designed as heads of the four

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:15.000
sons of Horus. Emsit, Hopi, Duomatef, Kebehessenuf, Nephthys kneels at the feet of the dead, and Isis

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:28.200
is shown at the head. What happened? How is it that when we get to the time of Ptolemy II,

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:35.160
the creation of the Septuagint, that we all of a sudden had the monotheistic approach to theology

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:43.320
from these Israelites? I think the answer to this question is very simple. The popular philosophy

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:51.960
of any given time period is going to dramatically affect the theology of that period. For example,

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:59.400
we see how much the Stoics and Epicureans influenced the Middle Platonist, who in turn

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:04.280
influenced Christian theologians and church fathers of the second century.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:08.840
But what about the third century BCE? At the time when the Pentateuch was being put together,

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:15.800
Platonism was on the rise, along with Aristotle's School of the Peripatetic and the skepticism of

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:21.160
Pyrrho. These philosophers, with the resources of the Great Library of Alexandria,

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:28.840
with access to thinkers like Zoraster, the Magian, and Heraclitus, some of the earliest thinkers

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:36.120
to exhibit monotheistic or skeptic tendencies against the dogmas and superstitions of the day.

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:43.640
Initiation here into the ancient mysteries so honored among men mocks holiness.

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:50.440
They raised their voices at stone idols as a man might argue with his doorpost.

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:53.320
They have understood so little of the gods.

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:05.320
Thales was the first master of the School of Athens. He was known for traveling to see the

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:10.680
greatest minds of his day in Egypt and Babylon. He taught that water was the first principle,

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:19.400
archaic, in which life can spring from. Thales believed in an uncreated being who crafts

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:26.840
fuses, nature, which all things are from. In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:32.280
Now the earth was formless and empty. Darkness was over the surface of the deep,

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:39.000
and the spirit of God was hovering over the waters. Notice how water is the first thing that

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:45.000
is formed. This is in line with the philosophical thinking of Thales in the School of Athens,

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:51.000
and is also possible of the Egyptian sages or Magile Xoraster, believed in something similar.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.560
Heraclitus describes Thales as a Phoenician by remote descent.

01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:03.480
When Thales died, Anaximander became the second master, who was said to be the teacher of Pythagoras,

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:09.800
who brought these teachings to Italy. Anaximander is the earliest use of the word

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:18.040
eperion, or infinite, limitless, to designate the original first principle of the cosmos, uncreated,

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:24.120
beginning of all things. The first philosopher to employ in philosophical context, the term

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:30.040
archae, which until then had meant beginning or origin. Anaximander called this something by the

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:37.160
name fousis or nature. Next after him was Anaximinis, third master of the School of Athens, from the

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:44.920
Melesian school, who was a material monist, who sought to discover the archae, the beginning or

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:53.160
origin, the one underlying basis of all things. Anaximinis also believed that air was divine.

01:06:54.120 --> 01:07:01.240
He identified air with the breath of life, and thus the soul as well as the air and the atmosphere.

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:09.240
Only a single sentence long quote by Anaximinis arrives, just as our soul, being air,

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:16.360
holds us together, so Numa and air encompass and guard the whole world.

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:25.320
This is the first extant source to use the word Numa or breath. Genesis 2.7 says,

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:33.160
the Lord God formed man from dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life,

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:43.800
the Numa, and the man became a living being. Genesis lines up perfectly with the philosophy

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:56.280
of the Presocratics. After Anaximinis you get Heraclitus, who claims to announce an everlasting

01:07:56.280 --> 01:08:04.040
logos or word, according to which all things are one in some sense. Opposites are necessary for life,

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:11.160
but they are unified in a system of balanced exchanges. The world itself consists of a law-like

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:18.280
interchange of elements symbolized by fire, and Anaximinis is criticized by Parminides,

01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:25.080
who starts the School of the Eliatics. He is called the Father of Logic. It is during this time

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:34.680
that superstitions and dogmas are being challenged. Anaxagoras would be the next master, Vathens,

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:39.400
and his innovative theory of physical nature is encapsulated in the phrase,

01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:46.280
a portion of everything in everything. Its primary expression is found in the following

01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:52.600
difficult fragment, and since the portions of both the large and the small are equal in amount,

01:08:53.400 --> 01:09:00.440
in this way too all things would be in everything, nor can they be separate, but all things have a

01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:06.200
portion of everything. Since there cannot be as smallest, nothing can be separated or come to

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:12.920
be by itself, but as in the beginning now too all things are together, but in all things there are

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:19.640
many things equal in amount both in the larger and the smaller of things being separated off.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:28.040
God is one, is also a phrase that is attributed to him, who in response to the challenges imposed

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:34.680
by the competing schools of Parminides and Empedocles is able to unify the leading theories of

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:42.120
the day. Anaxagoras introduced the concept of the noose, or the cosmic mind, as an ordering force,

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:50.440
and one of his students would be Archelaus, the next master of the school, who was also at this

01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:57.720
time a staunch skeptic and natural philosopher. He is the one who teaches Socrates, and Socrates

01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:03.240
is the teacher of Plato. Plato would be the one to unify the entire base of knowledge that Athens

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:09.400
had been accumulating from the world for the past 200 years and bring them into his dialogues

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:13.560
through the character of Socrates, who was his teacher.

01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:27.560
Plato wrote a dialogue called Timaeus, an exposition of cosmology in which the Demiurge,

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:34.680
the agent who takes the pre-existing materials of chaos, arranges them according to the models

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:42.200
of eternal forms, produces all physical things of the world, including human bodies. The Demiurge,

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:49.480
or the craftsman, if you want to say that, is sometimes thought of as the platonic personification

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:57.000
of active reason. What is so striking about this is that the Demiurge is the craftsman of the universe

01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:06.040
like Yahweh or Ptah or El in the Ugritic text. He is the uncorated creator of the gods and humans

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:13.800
alike. Plato's idea of the cosmos is identical to what is taught in Judeo-Christian cosmology

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:21.480
in the time when the Pentateuch is put together. Plato, like his predecessors, were challenging

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:28.200
the dogmas and superstitions of his day, and he even sought to replace Homer and Hesiod,

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:35.480
the two most famous poets of ancient Greece, where most religious ideas of the day

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:43.880
are found in the stories about their gods. For instance, take Plato in Republic Book 3

01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:50.200
through the mouth of Socrates says, There was another motive in purifying religion.

01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:57.880
Which is to banish fear. For no man can be courageous, who is afraid of death,

01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:02.520
who believes the tales, which are repeated by the poets concerning the world below.

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:12.600
They must be gently requested not to abuse hell or Hades. They may be reminded that their stories

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:20.440
are both untrue and discouraging. Nor must they be angry if we expunge obnoxious passages,

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:27.960
such as the depressing words of Achilles. I would rather be serving man than rule over the dead.

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:35.560
In the verses which tell of the squalid mansions, the senseless shadows, the fitting soul mourning

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:42.840
over lost strength and youth, the soul with a gibber going beneath the earth like smoke,

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:49.640
or the souls of the suitors which flutter about like bats, the terrors and horrors

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:57.720
of cockatice and sticks, ghost and shapeless shades, and the rest of their tartarian nomenclature

01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:04.520
must vanish. Such tales may have their use, but they are not the proper food for soldiers,

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:12.440
as little can we admit the sorrows and sympathies of the Homeric heroes, Achilles the son of Thetis,

01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:18.440
in tears, throwing ashes on his head, or pacing up and down the seashore in distraction.

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:26.840
Or Priam, the cousin of the gods, crying aloud, rolling in the mire. A good man is not prostrated

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:33.640
at the loss of children or fortune, neither is death terrible to him, and therefore lamentations

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:39.400
over the dead should not be practiced by men of note, they should be the concern of inferior

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:46.440
persons only, whether women or men. Still worst is the attribution of such weakness to the gods,

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:53.400
as when the goddess say, a loss may travail, and the worst of all, when the king of heaven himself

01:13:53.400 --> 01:14:00.200
laments in the inability to save Hector, or sorrows over the impending doom of his dear Sarpadam.

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:07.400
Such a character of God is not ridiculed by our young men, is likely to be imitated by them,

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:13.400
nor should our citizens be given the excess laughter. Such violent delights are followed

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:19.640
by violent reaction. The description in the Iliad of the gods, shaking their sides at their

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:26.360
clumsiness of Hephaestus, will not be admitted by us, certainly not.

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:40.920
Plato is clearly not satisfied with the pagan religions of his day, and wants to replace it

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:48.920
with a more up-to-date or mature theology, with a perfect god who has no mistakes and is never

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:55.800
depicted doing anything that we can look at as weak. Plato says, let us declare then for what

01:14:55.800 --> 01:15:05.160
caused nature, and this all was framed by him that framed it. He was good, and in none that is good

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:12.280
can there arise jealousy of ought at any time. So being far aloof from this, he desired that all

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:19.720
things should be as like unto himself as possible. This is that the most sovereign cause of nature

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:25.640
in the universe, which we shall most surely be right in accepting from men of understanding,

01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:31.560
for God desiring that all things should be good, and that so far as this might be,

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:37.080
there should be not evil having received all that is visible, not in a state of rest,

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:42.520
but moving without harmony or measure, brought it from its disorder into order,

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:49.560
thinking that this was all in ways better than the other. And Plato continues,

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:56.680
in the forming the universe, he curated reason in soul and soul and body, that he might be the

01:15:56.680 --> 01:16:04.360
maker of a work that was by nature the most fair and perfect. In this way then, we ought to affirm

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:11.640
according to probable account that this universe is a living creature and very truth possessing soul

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:14.520
and reason by the providence of God.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:28.200
Plato also rejected Athenian democracy in favor of a republic guided by a priesthood

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:34.760
and a philosopher king, whose laws were given by the gods and are the most ancient and holy.

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:42.680
He rejected even things he once said were great before, such as the Dionysian mysteries of love

01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:50.520
and passion, which he now argues in his last work are empty pleasures. For instance, in his last work

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:57.880
On Laws, 636b, these common meals, for example, and these gymnasia,

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:03.000
while they are at present beneficial to the states and many other respects,

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:11.640
yet in the event of civil strife, they prove dangerous. And moreover, this institution,

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:17.640
one of old standing, is thought to have corrupted the pleasures of love which are natural not to

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:25.080
men, but also natural to beast. For this, your states are held primarily responsible

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:30.200
and along with them all others that are especially encouraged the use of the gymnasia.

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:36.200
And whether one makes the observation in earnest or in jests, one certainly should not fail to

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:42.280
observe that when a male unites with female for the procreation, the pleasure, experience is held

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:49.400
to be due to nature, but contrary to nature, when male mates with male or female with female,

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:55.400
and that those first guilty of such enormities were impelled by their slavery to pleasure.

01:17:56.280 --> 01:18:05.400
And we all accuse the Cretans of concocting the story about Ganymede to justify unnatural pleasures.

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:09.800
In case you didn't know, Ganymede was the boy lover of Zeus.

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:17.240
When we look at this, in context to the story of Maccabees, you see the laws enacted and followed

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:23.480
by none other than the Maccabee dynasty, who revolts against the Greek pagan king Antiochus

01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:31.080
IV for putting a gymnasium in Jerusalem, which they called an abomination. Looks like Judas

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:37.320
Maccabees and Plato believe the same thing about gymnasiums. I also think there is clear ties to

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:43.960
ancient Babylon, Assyrian and Sumerian laws, stories woven in the text. These are in no doubt in my

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:50.600
mind authentic and ancient Near Eastern texts that the Greeks inherit from the Jews. For example,

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:56.760
Deuteronomy, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, is clearly an ancient law that we see present

01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:03.480
in Hammurabi's code. As Plato said in the Republic, though, for people to respect the laws,

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:10.280
they need to be the most ancient and given by the gods from the oldest times. But I also think

01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:17.720
there is no reason to believe that the philosophers and scribes of Alexandria, like Demetrius Filarium,

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:21.640
did not have any oversight over what was written and edited.

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:36.200
What solid evidence do we have that Platonism has any influence on Judaism? If we continue down our

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:42.680
line of masters, schools, methods, as I trace the roots of Thales down to Plato,

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:48.600
the next three school masters after Plato is Aristotle, who, after the conquest of Alexander

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:55.880
the Great, is sent into exile by the Ellusinian priest, who charged Aristotle with blasphemy

01:19:55.880 --> 01:20:03.400
against the gods, and Aristotle is replaced by Theophrastus, who was also charged by the Athenian

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:09.560
religious leaders with blasphemy against the gods. Now keep in mind, all of this is happening after

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:15.480
Socrates. What is happening with these masters of Athens being at odds with the religious leaders

01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:21.160
of the priests of the Ellusinians? They're obviously challenging the dogmas and superstitions.

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:29.240
Now Theophrastus was the student and new master of the school who taught Demetrius Filarium.

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:36.360
Demetrius Filarium was also exiled, and he moves to Alexandria with Pierrot the Skeptic

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:43.640
after traveling the world with Alexander the Great, meeting Brahmins and Magi and living

01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:49.880
amongst the Chaldeans and Babylon, and they went down to the court of Ptolemy and Alexandria

01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:57.400
to help build the library. According to multiple sources, Demetrius Filarium was trying to collect

01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:03.240
all the books in the inhabitable world and was commissioned by Ptolemy to translate the laws

01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:10.760
of the Jews into Greek. In my personal opinion, it is at this time when the Pentateuch is put

01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:17.960
together in its current monotheistic form, with influences from the Platonist of the time period.

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:26.360
You see, we have a direct line from Thales the Presocratics all the way down to Plato

01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:36.600
and then continuing down to Demetrius who moves to Alexandria Egypt and creates the Pentateuch.

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:44.920
Here's what Josephus says about this. When Alexander had reigned 12 years and after him

01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:50.360
Ptolemy sought her 40 years, Philadelphius then took the kingdom of Egypt and held it 40 years

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:57.800
within one. He procured the law to be interpreted and set free those who come from Jerusalem into

01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:06.200
Egypt and were in slavery there, who were 120,000. The occasion was this. Demetrius Filarius,

01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:12.360
who was library keeper to the king, was now endeavoring, if it were possible, to gather

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:18.440
together all the books that were in the inhabitable earth. And buying whatsoever was anywhere valuable

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:24.360
or agreeable to the king's inclination, which inclination of his Demetrius was zealously subservient.

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:30.440
And when once Ptolemy asked him how many tens of thousands of books he had collected, he replied

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:37.400
that he already had 20 times 10,000, but that in a little time he should have 50 times 10,000.

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:44.440
But be said, he had been informed that there are many books of the laws among the Jews worthy

01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:50.440
of inquiring for and worthy of the king's library, but which, being written of characters and in

01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:56.120
dialect of their own, will cause no small pains in getting them translated into the Greek tongue,

01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:59.960
that the character in which they are written seems to be like that which is proper to the

01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:05.720
character of the Syrians, and that its sound when pronounced is like theirs also, and that this sound

01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:12.120
appears to be peculiar to themselves, wherefore he said that nothing hindered why they might not get

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:17.080
those books to be translated also. For while nothing is wanting that is necessary for that

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:23.240
purpose, we may have their books also in this library. So the king thought that Demetrius was

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:28.120
very zealous to procure him an abundance of books, and that he suggested that this was exceeding

01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:33.880
proper for him to do, and therefore he wrote to the Jewish high priest that he should act accordingly.

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:41.160
Demetrius wrote in a letter, It is not fit for us, O king, to overlook things hastily

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:47.800
or to deceive ourselves, but to lay the truth open, for since we have determined not only to get

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:54.280
the laws of the Jews transcribed, but interpreted also, for thy satisfaction, by what means can we

01:23:54.280 --> 01:24:00.280
do this, while so many of the Jews are now slaves in thy kingdom. For both these people, and we also

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:07.960
worship the same God, the framer of all things, we call him, and that truly by the Greek Xena,

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:15.240
or Jupiter, because he breathes life into all men, wherefore do thou restore these men

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:22.440
to their own country, and that this do the honor of God, because these men pay a peculiar excellent

01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:28.440
worship to him. Known as how Demetrius is already comparing his framer of all things,

01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:34.280
the divine craftsman or demiurge, who he was most likely comparing to Yahweh in order to

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:41.400
unify this God with Jupiter. Keep in mind, less than a century before this, the fragments of the

01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:50.360
Jewish communities that we have are still polytheistic. We have a direct line from the masters of the

01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:57.960
Athens Academy, from Thales all the way down to Demetrius, who is writing this letter to the Jews,

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:04.680
who is the face of the creation of the Pentateuch. I think there is more than enough evidence to

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:10.600
lay this argument out, that this is the beginning of the trend of monotheism, and at this time,

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:16.920
the priestshoods of Yahweh and El, synced with that of the craftsmen and demiurgic

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:24.360
creator gods of Egypt and Greece, Yahweh of the Elohim, and the God who has its roots all over

01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:32.200
Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean world, such as Kronos, El, Pita, Yahweh, or Zeus, or Amen Ra.

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:39.960
The so-called pagans that lived after this time period also adopt the same monist trends

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:47.960
the Judeo-Christians adopt. The soul-invictus religion would come from that and the neoplateness

01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:55.960
philosophers and theurgists were no exception to this. The Chaldean oracles also show a

01:25:56.760 --> 01:26:03.960
one who is above all gods. The philosophy of the time, Platonism to Middle Platonism,

01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:10.280
and eventually Neoplatonism, would continue to influence the theology of whatever time matched it.

01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:23.880
I'll leave you with this. In a text from Plutarch called Moralia, he says,

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:32.440
moreover, most people believe that Amon is the name given to Zeus in the land of the Egyptians,

01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:41.880
a name which we, with a slight alteration, pronounce Amon. But Menitho of Seventus thinks that the

01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:50.600
meaning concealed or concealment lies in this word. Hecateus of Abdera says that the Egyptians

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:57.000
use the expression one to another whenever they call to anyone. For the word is a form of address

01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:04.680
when they therefore address the supreme god whom they believe to be the same as the universe as

01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:12.680
if he were invisible, concealed, and implore him to make visible himself and manifest to them.

01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:19.720
They use the word Amen. So great then was the circumspection of the Egyptians and their wisdom

01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:25.320
touching all that had to do with the gods. Plutarch is proposing that the term Amen

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:34.520
is a shout or chant that is used to call on any of the gods, not just Amon, but any of the gods

01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:42.200
including the supreme invisible one. He also cites Hecateus of Abdera for this very idea. And it
