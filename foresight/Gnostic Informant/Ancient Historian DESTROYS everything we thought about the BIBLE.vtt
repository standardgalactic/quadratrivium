WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
We're researching this, it's always about lifting the hood and looking what is the reality on the ground.

00:07.000 --> 00:15.000
I'll say something that might shock a lot of people, but basically in the Persian period, we have thousands of documents from

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
Yahwistic slash Jewish sources. So when I look at all of this data, all of it together,

00:21.000 --> 00:28.000
there is literally zero evidence for any knowledge and any familiarity with the Bible throughout the entire period.

00:28.000 --> 00:39.000
Historically, it is so clear and so conspicuous that up until the library was established late tail end of the 4th century,

00:39.000 --> 00:48.000
beginning of the 3rd century BC in Alexandria, up until that moment, we see zero evidence of any type of knowledge of the Bible

00:48.000 --> 00:55.000
anywhere in any of the Jewish diaspora, whether in Egypt, Babylonia, Judea, Samaria, etc.

00:55.000 --> 01:02.000
This changes at the beginning of the 3rd century so clearly, we start seeing those names appearing in the Cateus of Abdera,

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
or whatever text that we have there, people start knowing something about the Bible, referring to the Bible.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
But you see elements like that, you see Anat Yahu, the goddess Anat Yahu.

01:13.000 --> 01:22.000
It says that they brought an offering to Yahweh, and the line under that says that one Atrodan, that they had an Atrodan there.

01:22.000 --> 01:30.000
Now Atrodan today in Zoroastrianism is an Atashtan, but that is the fire holder of Zoroastrian cult.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
So in their temple, in the Yahweh's temple, they had a fire holder.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Is that an Avestan term that you just used?

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Yeah, it's an Avestan term.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
That's not a Semitic thing, that's an Avestan thing.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Absolutely, absolutely.

01:43.000 --> 01:50.000
There were major people who were called Maghush, and one of them was Moses.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
You know, how Moses was an Alchemist, you know, to make nature do what he wanted.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
But also that Moses was the teacher of Orpheus.

02:00.000 --> 02:15.000
My special guest today, Professor Gad Barneya, who is a lecturer at the Department of Jewish History

02:15.000 --> 02:22.000
and Biblical Studies at the University of Haifa, as well as a research fellow at the Bible in its traditions.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
A research project and flagship in the field of digital humanities.

02:27.000 --> 02:35.000
Barneya's scholarly focus is directed at researching and teaching the evolution and character of Yahwism

02:35.000 --> 02:43.000
under the Iranian Age of Empires, from the rise of the Achaemenidid Empire to the fall Sasanian Empire.

02:43.000 --> 02:51.000
Specifically in the realm of cultic practices, Barneya's scholarship examines the dialogue and symbiosis

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
of early Zoroastrianism and Yahwism or early Judaism.

02:56.000 --> 03:03.000
The Iranian Age of Empires was instrumental as the historical and ideological background

03:03.000 --> 03:12.000
for the composition, addition, and redaction of the Hebrew Bible, which took place in the Hellenistic period.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
Yes, you heard that right, according to Dr. Barneya.

03:17.000 --> 03:25.000
The Bible that we have in our possession is a product of the Hellenistic period at the Library of Alexandria,

03:25.000 --> 03:34.000
which produced the Bible, the apocryphal text, early Christianity, and the so-called Gnostic writings,

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
as well as rabbinic and early mystical Judaism.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
We're going to talk about all that in this video. Buckle your seatbelts because you're going to want to strap in for this one.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
And welcome back to the Gnostic Enformment, and you are about to attain true gnosis.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
And today I'm joined with Professor Gad Barneya all the way out.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
You're over in Israel right now, if I'm not mistaken, right? And hi for university.

03:58.000 --> 04:07.000
And yeah, your work is really fascinating because things that I've stumbled on in the couple years that I've been doing this channel

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
and talking to experts in the field like yourself.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
One of the things is the question of what was going on in these different temple periods.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
We call it the first temple period built supposedly by Solomon.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
And there's a second temple period supposedly when they come back from Babylon.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
And you have a book coming out that a lot of people are really waiting for, me and myself.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
Link's going to be in the description where it's coming out in a couple of months.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Is that so? A couple of months?

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
It's slated to come out on November 4th.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Yes. Okay. So only a few months away.

04:43.000 --> 04:52.000
And I'm telling all my followers, get this book because it's going to shake some things up in this discussion.

04:52.000 --> 05:00.000
And the topic of this book is what was Yawism like under the Achaemenid period, the Persian period?

05:00.000 --> 05:12.000
And so what are some of the misconceptions that people think about this time period and what was going on with and also why do we call it Yawism and not Judaism?

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
Great. So two great points, great questions.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
So the first, I'll start with talking a little bit about Yawism.

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
Yawism is a cult.

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
I mean, speaking of religion for that period, I mean, the word religion doesn't really apply to that early period.

05:32.000 --> 05:39.000
By religion, I mean a system of rules to follow, observances and things like that.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
So I use the term cult.

05:42.000 --> 05:55.000
So Yawism is a cultic system where the main, the head of the pantheon, the main deity is, but not the only one, is Yahweh or Yahu as they wrote it.

05:55.000 --> 06:10.000
And so that is really the simplest definition is simply people who adhere as their main ethnic deity to the deity known as Yaw or Yahweh.

06:10.000 --> 06:17.000
That's really the simplest definition and it's a pretty good definition because there wasn't really a lot more to it at the time.

06:17.000 --> 06:23.000
I'm putting the biblical image of that period aside from now.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
I'm talking purely from a historical perspective or archaeological perspective and things like that.

06:28.000 --> 06:37.000
And so the Yawism at the time was simply people who had their main ethnic deity.

06:37.000 --> 06:49.000
But I'm stressing that the main deity, not the exclusive deity, main deity Yahweh, but they certainly believed in other deities as well.

06:49.000 --> 07:00.000
And in local deities and imperial deities and things like that, they certainly believe that these other powers, supernatural powers have power over their own lives.

07:00.000 --> 07:17.000
And so Yawism is really just a form of cultic adherence to the deity known as Yaw, but with no specific observances and things like that.

07:17.000 --> 07:29.000
Now what's interesting, many scholars and certainly many lay people who are interested believe that Yawism morphed into Judaism later on, became more specialized,

07:29.000 --> 07:38.000
became adopted the features that we now associate with Judaism.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
And that's not the case.

07:40.000 --> 07:51.000
Yawism kind of spawned Judaism off, okay, and by extension also Christianity and other Samaritanism and things like that.

07:51.000 --> 07:58.000
But Yawism continued full force, at least until the fall of the Roman Empire.

07:58.000 --> 08:16.000
So in fact, what is absolutely fascinating, and it's another book I'm working on, is that if we were to travel back in time, 2,000 years or even less, you know, 1,700 years or so,

08:16.000 --> 08:26.000
to the Roman Empire and wanted to know what is the form of Yawism that is most popular, most well known, it wouldn't be Judaism or Christianity, it would be Yawism.

08:26.000 --> 08:43.000
And we see that in many, many, many thousands of amulets and magical items and things like that, medallions all across the Roman Empire, where Yaw in the Greek, okay,

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
Yota, Omega, yeah, yeah, exactly, with Alpha Omega.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
I run into this plot and it's a big topic on my channel, so yes, please.

08:51.000 --> 09:02.000
But that is a form of Yawism, because the head of the pantheon is Yaw, and that continued alongside Christianity, alongside Judaism for centuries.

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
Of course, I assume that you have that, you see that a lot in your chow.

09:07.000 --> 09:19.000
And if we're talking on the so-called Gnosticism, which is a term that I don't like, it's not a scientific term to call it Gnosticism, that's not how they identify.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
I've established that a million times, it's a pantheon term, it's like, yeah.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Your viewers are familiar, yeah, great.

09:26.000 --> 09:33.000
So Gnosticism, in a sense, is an outgrowth also of Yawism, an expression of Yawism as well.

09:33.000 --> 09:43.000
There's a big discussion, as you probably know, whether Gnosticism has any Jewish roots in it or is it only a Christian phenomenon, actually, in reality, it's neither.

09:43.000 --> 09:49.000
It's just a continuation of Yawism over the centuries.

09:49.000 --> 10:01.000
Yawism simply was the greater force in the kind of cultic community that worshipped Yaw.

10:02.000 --> 10:15.000
It started much earlier, continued while Judaism was being developed and Christianity and continued until at least the fall of the Roman Empire, but we can also, in a sense, it continues to this day.

10:15.000 --> 10:23.000
For example, in Kabbalah and things like that, it continues, in a sense, Yawism continues to this day.

10:23.000 --> 10:33.000
I'm not sure we want to have time to get into that, but that is the fundamental form of early Judaism.

10:33.000 --> 10:41.000
Again, early Judaism is not the correct term, but what will also spawn off Judaism later on.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
Okay, so there's a few different directions that I want to go.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
That's all we do.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Excuse me, I just want to make sure something clear.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
It's not my book.

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
It's an edited book, so it has a lot of different authors in it.

10:54.000 --> 11:02.000
I just edited and I have also a chapter in that book, but I edited it together with Professor Reinhard Krotz from Gottikin University.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
So it's not just me.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
Well, even better, more expertise and more opinions.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I love it.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
I love books like that or are papers that have multiple people involved.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Those are good stuff to read.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
Yeah, we have great, we have really, I mean, top leading scholars.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
You know, Conrad Schme, Margarita Fulmer, Tony Holm of Penn State University.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Stefan Schors and many, many others.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Kyle Vandertoon, of course, Reinhard Krotz as well.

11:29.000 --> 11:36.000
So you really, in this book, you have truly the leading scholars in the field coming together.

11:36.000 --> 11:42.000
Initially, it was a conference that I organized at the University of Haifa at the end of December of 22.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
And the book came as a result of that.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
It's not a proceedings book.

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
It's not just a list of just a collection of the papers that were presented.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
These are papers that grew out of our interactions at the conference.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
The conference was kind of a workshop.

11:58.000 --> 12:13.000
And we interacted a lot during the conference and even later on to produce, to think together through all of these issues that concern the Achaemenid Empire and the Alwists at that time to produce this volume.

12:13.000 --> 12:22.000
Okay, so it's, I mean, of course, I'm biased in a sense, but it is truly a groundbreaking book.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
We all have our biases, but no, I can't wait to read this.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
So, okay, so here's the two things that I want to get into.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
One of them is elephantine.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
Another one is that you mentioned this yaho, this three letter yaho or yahoo.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
And in the Greek, so I actually have a screenshot that I had prepared.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
It's from what we found in Qumran.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
I think Qumran.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Yeah, yeah, Qumran.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Okay.

12:47.000 --> 12:55.000
And this is, this is predates all these church Septuagint, the Codex Vaticanus, the Codex Sinaiticus, the Codex Alexandricus.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
And it shows you right there in Deuteronomy, I think, is this Deuteronomy?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Leviticus.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Leviticus.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Yes, thank you for correcting me.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Right there in Leviticus, you have the name yaho.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
And so there's that.

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
There's also, you also have in Aramaic, you have yahoo on these coins.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
And this is Persian period, I believe.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
And so there's three letters.

13:17.000 --> 13:23.000
And we're all used to the Tetragrammaton, the four letter name of Yahweh, or we don't even know how it's pronounced, actually.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Just kind of guess.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
So I'm saying Jehovah.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
That's all totally more modern way to say it.

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
But I'm wondering, because there's a lot of theories on this name.

13:34.000 --> 13:41.000
Now, there are some who points out, Diodorus of Sicily says this is the name of Dionysus.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
There's actually a text in the Chaldean oracles.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
I actually screen shot it.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
It's the English translation, but it's the Thomas Taylor translation of the Chaldean oracles.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
And he says, and right here I circled it, and I'll read it out just in case you can't see it.

13:55.000 --> 14:03.000
He says Dionysus or Bacchus was called by the Chaldeans, yahoo, instead of the intelligible light in the Phoenician tongue.

14:03.000 --> 14:09.000
He is frequently called Sabaoth, such as he who is above the seven poles, Demiurgus.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
What are your, are they wrong?

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
Oh, and then one more thing I wanted to point out.

14:15.000 --> 14:22.000
Plutarch in the early second century also says that Yahweh, or he hit the question in his text is called,

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Who is the God worshiped by the Jews?

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
It's one of these dialogues that he puts together with Ammonius and a couple other people that he's with.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
I forgot their names, but there's a whole list of them.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
And he's like, who is this God that the Jews are worshiping?

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
He goes, it looks like to be like either a Donus or Dionysus.

14:37.000 --> 14:46.000
And he gets a bunch of, he gets a bunch of really good arguments of like the similarities between the ways of the priests and the Ellusinian mystery dress.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
They had the same colors.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
They had the same tassels hanging down.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
They play the same flutes.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
They do Psalms, all this stuff.

14:52.000 --> 15:00.000
I'm like, whoa, this is actually really, I was expecting to hear a really like kind of a weak argument of why they think that.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
But it wasn't Plutarch lays it out.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
And I'm like, I wonder what scholars think about this.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
And you don't hear about it a lot.

15:07.000 --> 15:15.000
Now you've been digging into this from the expert, from your expertise, from a scholarly position, looking at the facts.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
What's, how do we sort this out?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
So two things.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
I mean, first of all, that has, that's really appeared much later than the book that we're talking about.

15:22.000 --> 15:30.000
So, and so I will talk about this very quickly, but then I'd like to refocus our, our discussion on that on the Achaemenid period.

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
But that, I mean, the points that you're, that you're, that you're making are important and interesting.

15:35.000 --> 15:41.000
And of course, very, very, very, very apropos as well to the development of Fiawism.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
You did not mention also Macrobius.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
That's later.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
I didn't want to go too late.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Well, but it's the same.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
It's exactly the same vein.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
I mean, we are talking later, but Macrobius, you're right.

15:52.000 --> 15:58.000
It's later, but the way he, I mean, and he's quoting, he's actually quoting a text from the second century.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Yeah.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
He's right here.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Right here.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Yeah.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Wait, right.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
He says this, yeah.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Yeah.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Oh, I'll read it out for people so we can all be on the same page.

16:07.000 --> 16:16.000
He says, the Orpheans calling Eubola, good counsel, point to this God having been provided for if the plans of the mind are born of conception.

16:16.000 --> 16:21.000
The authors think that the mind of the world is the sun from which the principle of understanding flows into men.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
They believe that the sun stood before the merit of good plan.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
Orpheus clearly pronounces that the sun in this free verse.

16:27.000 --> 16:34.000
And then that says in Greek, Helios on Dionysus, Epic, Klessin, Kellius, Ian.

16:34.000 --> 16:41.000
And then he says under that, right underneath that he says one Zeus, one Hades, one Helios, one Dionysus.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
And then this is the part that you're getting into.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
He actually calls.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
He actually names this syncretic God.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Yeah.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Oh, the three letters that we just talked about.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
And he cites this oracle of Apolloclarius.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
He's basically saying that this God is like the supreme God.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Okay.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
So now we're now we're getting later in time.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
But as you mentioned, he's citing earlier sources.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
This is something that I've been talking about on my channel for a while.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
So let's.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
All right.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Now we have everyone on the same page.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Now.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
Now this is this actually goes back to the point I was making yawism continued.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
This is this is an evolution of yawism.

17:19.000 --> 17:24.000
And the last thing, the chat, the match, the Greek magical papyri.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Yeah.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Oh, it's all over the place.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Every single passage.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Yeah.

17:29.000 --> 17:38.000
So, and that's why I'm saying if we were to go back in time, you know, 1700 or even 1600 years back or of course 2000 years back.

17:38.000 --> 17:45.000
And we wanted to know what is the kind of the most popular form of yawism of the date yaw?

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Where is it?

17:46.000 --> 17:53.000
Where is this daily being most kind of worshipped or for lack of a better term?

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
It would not be in Judaism or Christianity.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
It would be much more.

17:57.000 --> 18:03.000
And it's not only where yawists in a sense, very popular.

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
And the reason I'm saying in a sense is that this was not nothing was exclusive at that time.

18:08.000 --> 18:20.000
You could be, you could believe in your magic amulets and, you know, in texts and things like that and curse text that yaw is going to protect you.

18:20.000 --> 18:29.000
But at the same time go and offer sacrifices to Mithra, you know, and or to the Roman emperor or to the or different deities, etc.

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
Nothing was, nothing was absolutely exclusive.

18:34.000 --> 18:50.000
And also Jews and Christians also had, you know, moments where they went in and became yawists for a while, at least in terms of curses and magic formulae.

18:50.000 --> 18:58.000
So, so yawism was always there, not in the background, but in the foreground.

18:58.000 --> 19:06.000
In terms of, and it was an extremely popular, I mean, yawism was extremely popular also across the empire.

19:06.000 --> 19:22.000
Now this also helps to explain, because you know, the Roman empire was at a point where it's in the fourth century where it was almost, it kind of had, it would have gone either with Mithra, Mithraism or Christianity, you know.

19:22.000 --> 19:34.000
And what, and let me guess what you have to say, I just have to, this is so exciting, because this is something that I've really been, I, and me, I went into this evidence kind of blindly just kind of leading where it see where it takes me.

19:34.000 --> 19:39.000
And I came to the conclusion that like, this explains the rise of Christianity in a way.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Right. Exactly.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Exactly.

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
This is what made Christianity a lot more palpable to to the Romans.

19:46.000 --> 19:55.000
And this is why the church, the early church fathers had to combat the remnants of yawism all over the empire. Right.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
So that's, that's what he wrote against what we call the Nostics.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
In a sense, the Nostics are simply yawists.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Okay.

20:02.000 --> 20:08.000
And so, and so the, or what they call Nostics again, this term is so, so misleading.

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
But all of the different sects, you know, the Sethians, etc.

20:12.000 --> 20:17.000
All of these different, different forms of yawism are simply forms of yawism.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
A lot of them call them magus too.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
You hear that Simon magus, Marcus magus.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
So there, there's some sort of Persian stuff going on here, which is what we're going to get.

20:25.000 --> 20:33.000
Well, you know, the magus, so magus, now we're starting to go back to the Persian complex and I'd like to, to continue with that.

20:33.000 --> 20:44.000
Yeah, but magus, you know, in the Greek sources, there were several major people who were called magus.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
And one of them was Moses.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Wow.

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
So one of them, they considered Moses to be a magus as well in several Greek sources.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Yep.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
That's fascinating.

20:56.000 --> 21:13.000
Yeah, they considered Moses was, what's really interesting about Moses, about the figure of Moses is if we were to go back even further back in time to the third century, and even the second, early second century BCE, but mainly in the third century, and even late

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
force or late force to the early second.

21:16.000 --> 21:23.000
And we wanted to know what people think of Moses, we would get at least five completely different stories.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Right.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
I can tell you some of there is probably the first person.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
That's right.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
That's right.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Well, that's one of the sources.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Absolutely.

21:31.000 --> 21:52.000
He was, Moses was seen as this military leader who defeated the Ethiopians, or one that defeated other, other Nubian tribes, or a magus, an alchemist, or, and it has echoes in the Bible, you know, how well this was an alchemist and, you know, we're able to do all these, all these to, to, to, to make nature do what he, what he wanted.

21:53.000 --> 22:17.000
But, but also that Moses was the, the, the teacher of Orpheus, because he was, I've been all over that verse, because I want people to look guys, these Alexandrians, these Jews and Alexandria, they're calling themselves Orphics, basically, they're saying, Mousseus, this guy from Athens is the same as Moses and there's all tell us about that and then let's get back to the Persians.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Yeah.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
I mean, that's just typical kind of popular etymology.

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
In Greek, Mousseus sounds like it's the mused, you know, the muses.

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
And so, and so you hear that and you're like, yeah, that's the teacher of Orpheus.

22:31.000 --> 22:39.000
He was also seen, as I said, as a magus, as a magus, as an alchemist, as someone who can bend the rules of nature according to his will.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
And so, yeah.

22:40.000 --> 22:50.000
And so that also shows that the story of Moses and who that, who that was, was not decided even in the third century BCE.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Okay.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
There was not, there was no canonical version.

22:54.000 --> 23:00.000
They, what's interesting in these versions of Moses is that they're not polemic.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
You know, they're not even debating other versions.

23:03.000 --> 23:08.000
They're not trying to show how their version is correct and like the biblical version is wrong.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
They're simply ignorant.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
They don't know of the biblical version.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Right.

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
That's another important thing is like this Moses is completely different than we think of today.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
That's right.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
Well, that's what's interesting is it's not completely different.

23:22.000 --> 23:33.000
The Bible shows, I think, took all of these images of Moses that were already current in the region in Ptolemaic, you know, in the Ptolemaic regions.

23:33.000 --> 23:41.000
And, and, and is the Bible is polemic, polemic with those versions.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
So it is, it is, it takes elements.

23:44.000 --> 23:55.000
We do see elements, for example, of Moses being doing supernatural things, parting the seas, although all of the, you know, and tossing the rods and they become old.

23:55.000 --> 24:04.000
So we do see elements that were popular in the Greek culture being adopted by the, by the, by the biblical authors.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
But, but we don't see the other way around.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
The, the, the, the more the earlier sources are not arguing.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
They are simply unfamiliar with the biblical sources.

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
They present him as sort of like a superhero magus character who's correct.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Yeah.

24:18.000 --> 24:24.000
Doing a bunch of magic and he's kind of a hero type typical of Hellenism, Hellenistic.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Absolutely.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Hero character.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Um, and it's fat.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Okay.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
That is fascinating.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
You got this mousseus character and Athens and then there's Moses down in Alexandria.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
And they're sort of trying to figure out.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
We're trying to figure out if it's the same person or not.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Orpheus also.

24:39.000 --> 24:48.000
And in the James Charles worth student picker father, there's a whole chapter on Orpheka text that these Jewish orpheka text.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
And look at what Orpheus is.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
He's a, he's a psalmist.

24:52.000 --> 24:57.000
He's playing music on a harp and there it's theological, theological music.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
He's called theologian.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
That's where that word comes from the first time there.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
First time people ever use the word theologian.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
It's for Orpheus.

25:04.000 --> 25:09.000
And some of his texts are referred to as apocalypses revelations.

25:09.000 --> 25:14.000
So a lot of the same technical terminology we're seeing for Judeo Christianity.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
We're seeing in these orphics in Alexandria.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Yeah.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Absolutely.

25:19.000 --> 25:28.000
So what's interesting is also, even in the second century, the, the, the, the exagogue of Ezekiel, I'm assuming you're familiar with that.

25:28.000 --> 25:37.000
That's a play, a Greek play that was written in Alexandria, probably performed in Alexandria, where a Jewish author that is completely canonized.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
I mean, he writes perfectly.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Tragedy.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
And if I'm not mistaken, right.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Exactly.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
He's an Ezekiel Tragedy.

25:44.000 --> 25:54.000
And even his version of Moses in the second century, so relatively late second century BCE is not exactly the biblical version.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
It's also kind of a mishmash.

25:56.000 --> 26:01.000
He is familiar now with the biblical version and he is dealing with it.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
Or at least the version that is very close to what we know from the Bible.

26:04.000 --> 26:13.000
But it's, but even in the second century, in Alexandria, second century BCE, that's the story of Moses was still not completely canonized.

26:13.000 --> 26:19.000
Was not, was not completely, did not reach the form that we are familiar today.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
You ready for this?

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
This is a question.

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
And I want this might, your answer might shock some people with this.

26:25.000 --> 26:33.000
Who is the first person that we can say with a name, not just always mentioned in some biblical text, but that we can put a name.

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
And a date on, who's the first person to mention Moses?

26:37.000 --> 26:46.000
Well, I mean, it's hard to tell because we do have some sources that are that seem to mention Moses, but they're quoted in much later sources.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
And that we need a huge grain of salt for that.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
I mean, we do have Hecateus of Adara.

26:52.000 --> 26:58.000
Yeah, Hecateus of Adara, but only quoted in much later Christian sources that are trying to make point and are polemical.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
Oh, so you're saying you're saying that's the one they're citing.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
That's right.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Because we lost the Hecateus of Adara.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
Correct.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Yeah, we lost the original.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
So they're citing him.

27:09.000 --> 27:21.000
Now, in many cases, the citations are fine, but we need to take each case, each case independently and evaluate how, you know, how likely it is to be, to be, to be accurate.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
In many, in many cases, I have my doubts.

27:25.000 --> 27:36.000
But let's, you know, let's, let's be very open here and say, you know what, let's even accept that we're talking about Hecateus of Adara late fourth century.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
So what's that?

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Like 320 BC, something like that.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Right.

27:41.000 --> 27:47.000
So even then, even if that is the first time a Moses is mentioned, that's very late.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
Very late.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
That's why I mean by like, this might shock some people.

27:50.000 --> 28:02.000
How often is, because, okay, here's another thing that I, because I've been bouncing these ideas off with biblical scholars who are more on the not, I wouldn't say conservative side.

28:02.000 --> 28:07.000
They're not conservative, but like, they're more on like the, they're going with the, what's the earliest we can date it.

28:07.000 --> 28:12.000
We're kind of going at, we're trying to find the exact time where we can date things based on what we know for sure.

28:12.000 --> 28:18.000
These, these scholars, and I'm thinking, I'm not going to name names here, but like, they're going with like, oh, what about seventh century BC?

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
There's a, there's a reference here in one of the prophets.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
Is there, do the prophets seem to know Moses?

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
I don't think they do.

28:28.000 --> 28:35.000
Well, I'm laughing because, because, I mean, I cannot take the Bible as an historical source.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Okay.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
I have to say that very clearly.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
No one should.

28:40.000 --> 28:45.000
Now there are, the Bible does have, of course.

28:45.000 --> 28:50.000
That's how to, how to phrase that does have historical elements in it.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
But he's, but it's not a historical source.

28:53.000 --> 29:02.000
Now, like, for example, for example, there are, you know, certain Assyrian kings that are mentioned in the Bible and are mentioned within the context that makes sense.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
But the Bible is not interested in them as a historical source.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
It's interested in them.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
It's interested for, for different reasons.

29:08.000 --> 29:19.000
And, and it's very, very easy to take historical, a kind of a nucleus, a seed of, of a historical fact and make out, make a story out of it.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
We do it to this day.

29:21.000 --> 29:30.000
And so, and so we need to be very, very careful with the Bible in terms of historical and to say what the prophets knew.

29:30.000 --> 29:38.000
That is, that, that statement's the prophets knew of, or Hosea knew of X, you know, Hosea knew of the Exodus from Egypt, for example.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
I get that a lot.

29:40.000 --> 29:48.000
What, I mean, how do you know that that particular verse really was not edited into the text in the 3rd century or 2nd century BC?

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
You can't know that.

29:50.000 --> 30:02.000
Let me jump in right there because we know that the version, the, the, the condition, I don't know how to say condition or the form that we have our prophets.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
We know that there is layers that are added layer.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
We know that there is additions that are changed.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
We know that there's added, edited edits.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
I'm sorry.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Redactions.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
We don't, we, but okay.

30:13.000 --> 30:20.000
Is it possible that there's a layer from Isaiah that dates back to whatever 6th century BC or something like that?

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Possibly yes.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
But, but is, and I would say yes, I would say fine.

30:25.000 --> 30:33.000
Yeah, there probably was a guy named Isaiah, but the form that we have it in today, there's no way you're going to sit there and tell me that this is exactly how it was.

30:33.000 --> 30:44.000
Well, I mean, to be very scientific about it, I, and that's really what I'm trying to do in my research and with my students and to go and to be as scientific as possible about this.

30:44.000 --> 30:52.000
I would not be able to say that as a historian, I would not even be able to say there was an actual person called Isaiah.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
Because there's simply not no scientific proof for that.

30:55.000 --> 31:10.000
But I could, but, but is a text, some pericope, some text is currently in what we know from Isaiah from the book of what's called the book of Isaiah is that was already authored in the 7th century.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Sure, why not.

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
And that, that I would agree with, with that statement.

31:15.000 --> 31:23.000
But, and I have an article, for example, about about the, the introduction, right, the oracles against the nations on in the book of Amos.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Okay.

31:24.000 --> 31:32.000
Just this particular only these verses just this and I'm not dating the entire book and just dating the oracles.

31:32.000 --> 31:52.000
And I'm dating them because and I was able to date them to the late eight and beginning of the 7th century, because I can relate them to, to new Assyrian sources and I show that whomever wrote those passages are these verses new very in great detail.

31:52.000 --> 31:58.000
These are expressions from New York, neo Assyrian inscriptions and things like that.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
So I can date.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
And again, I'm not even saying that they were written.

32:01.000 --> 32:13.000
I mean, they could be already transmitted from that period, but whomever, whomever came up with these texts and might have transmitted them, you know, right from father to son or whatever orally over the centuries before they were written down.

32:13.000 --> 32:21.000
But the, the seed for these oracles was late 730, late 837 century BC.

32:21.000 --> 32:37.000
Now I was able, I'm able to do that because I can, I can show that they take new Assyrian imperial idiomatic expressions and implement them very systematically within the, the, the Amos, the introduction to Amos.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
That's what you have to do.

32:39.000 --> 32:43.000
See, that's what that's scientific.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
Exactly.

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
You have, you always need to have a reference outside the Bible in order to date the Bible.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
You cannot date the Bible from internal data.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
Right.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
You need something relative to base it off of.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
Correct.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
Correct.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
Yeah.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
This is now, this is where we get into the whole, how do we test people?

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Because people think I'm biased.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
I'm trying to attack the Bible.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
I'm biased.

33:03.000 --> 33:09.000
And I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, I really, I really don't care how old it is or when it's Hellenistic or Persian or what.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
I just want to know.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
And like, there's ways we can test this.

33:12.000 --> 33:18.000
So for example, you mentioned that there's a lot of, I was watching your lectures and you talk about this.

33:18.000 --> 33:23.000
How these, there's idioms that we can tell that are either Persian period.

33:23.000 --> 33:28.000
Sometimes they use words that are from the Avestan language, which is an Indo-European language.

33:28.000 --> 33:33.000
So it's like, that can't be, that can't go beyond, well, maybe it could.

33:33.000 --> 33:39.000
But I'm saying it's not likely that it can go past the Persian period into some sort of archaic period.

33:39.000 --> 33:44.000
And then there's even some that are Hellenistic that we were like, whoa, that's got to be written in like 200 BC.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
So to sort of bring it back to the Persian period.

33:47.000 --> 33:54.000
How do you detest and determine what is a Persian period versus what is not even just the temple?

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Like, how do we describe things in the temple?

33:56.000 --> 34:06.000
I'll say something that might shock a lot of people, but basically in the Persian period, we have thousands of documents from your mystic slash Jewish sources.

34:06.000 --> 34:12.000
When I combine all of the documents from Egypt, not just elephantine, mostly an elephantine, but not just.

34:12.000 --> 34:17.000
And Babylonia, the different settlements in Babylonia, El Yahudu and others.

34:17.000 --> 34:26.000
And in Judea and Samaria, these provinces, which we have very little texts from Judea and Samaria,

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
but we have coins, we have representations and things like that.

34:29.000 --> 34:40.000
So when I look at all of this data, all of it together, there is literally zero evidence for any knowledge and any familiarity with the Bible throughout the entire period.

34:40.000 --> 34:48.000
Okay, hold on. Let's explain this now. This is a lot. This is a big claim right here.

34:48.000 --> 34:52.000
So when you talk about, first of all, if anyone doesn't know what we mean by elephantine.

34:52.000 --> 35:03.000
So in 597 BC, I think that's roughly the date when Nebuchadnezzar, Sax, Israel, Jerusalem and the north, I don't know.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Maybe it's the north or the south.

35:05.000 --> 35:10.000
Well, I mean, yeah, there were waves, but we were usually talking about 586.

35:10.000 --> 35:18.000
586, okay. So what happens as a result, as you said, there's different dates and different battles that happen and different attacks.

35:18.000 --> 35:28.000
But roughly around this period in the 6th century BC, Israel was under attack and they start to flee south to Egypt, almost in a reversal exodus in a weird way.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
They're leaving their...

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Except there wasn't an exodus.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Right, right, right. Except there wasn't an exodus.

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
My channel has established that many times, but that's a whole nother.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
We can get into that another time probably, because that's a whole nother can of worms.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
But we're talking about later, we're talking about...

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
Well, actually, that does kind of relate in a way, but we can circle back to that.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
All right, so we're talking about 6th century BC.

35:51.000 --> 35:56.000
There are Israel, Judeans, what did you call them? Israelites or Judeans?

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Well, I called them Yahwists.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
I called them Yahwists.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Now, I have a number of articles about this.

36:02.000 --> 36:12.000
I have an article about the date in which the Colony of Elephantine was established, about the migration under the Egyptian King Amassees II.

36:12.000 --> 36:17.000
So I have an article that establishes that date from a lot of different perspectives.

36:17.000 --> 36:26.000
And I show that all of these different perspectives meet around 540, 550 BC.

36:26.000 --> 36:31.000
Oh, so okay, a few decades later then, is when they flee.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
That's right.

36:32.000 --> 36:37.000
But I have another article about Yahwistic identity at the time.

36:37.000 --> 36:43.000
And I show that Yahwistic, and on this article, people might even call me conservative.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
But I just follow the data.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
How the data?

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
And so, yeah, I just follow the data.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
I don't care if you call me minimalist or maximalist or conservative or whatever.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
I just follow the data.

36:54.000 --> 37:01.000
And so I have another article about the Yahwistic identity in the Achaemenid period that just came out a couple of months ago.

37:02.000 --> 37:16.000
And that article, in that article, I show from archeological evidence, names, mostly onomastics at the time, that there was around the time of the sack of Jerusalem, around the time of Nebuchadnezzar.

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
I mean, it started earlier, it started at the end of the seventh century.

37:20.000 --> 37:30.000
But there was already a shift, a kind of a cultic reform that created a unified Yahwistic identity, not just Judean.

37:30.000 --> 37:44.000
But a unified Yahwistic identity that was pretty, pretty uniform in Judea, in Samaria, in Babylonia, and later on in Elephantine, and of course other places.

37:44.000 --> 37:48.000
And we see it in the names so clearly.

37:48.000 --> 37:55.000
Now the names are, the names are, personal names are really your most kind of intimate identity, right?

37:55.000 --> 38:00.000
That's your, usually you inherit it from your father or your grandfather and things like that, or from your mother.

38:00.000 --> 38:06.000
And in people, you know, it goes from generation to generation, it is your identity, your familial identity.

38:06.000 --> 38:11.000
It's a big part of who you are, your personal name, certainly in antiquity.

38:12.000 --> 38:28.000
And we see that in Samaria, prior to the end, or to the end of the seventh century BCE, in Samaria, most of the Yahwistic names had the the the the the the the the deity part.

38:28.000 --> 38:34.000
Usually names in antiquity are composed of an adjective or a verb with a name of a deity.

38:34.000 --> 38:44.000
So for example, Hosea means Yahweh has saved or redeemed, or Yahushama Yahweh has heard and things like that.

38:44.000 --> 38:48.000
And you have it for a lot of different deities across the region, not just for Yahweh.

38:48.000 --> 38:52.000
And so these are the theophoric names, right?

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
Names that have the theos, the deity embedded in this.

38:56.000 --> 39:06.000
In Samaria, it was for uniform for a long time, that the Yahwistic element in these names is Yo, not Yaho or Yah, but Yo.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Okay, that was the name.

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
And in the south, in Judea, it was Yah or Yaho.

39:12.000 --> 39:23.000
There was a very clear distinction in how you write the name or pronounce the name in the in the names of the divine name within the personal names of people.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
That stopped, that shifted.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
I mean, the data is so clear.

39:27.000 --> 39:38.000
The names shift very clearly to the Judean form, okay, to Yah or Yaho towards the end of the 7th century and into the 6th century.

39:38.000 --> 39:42.000
But after the fall of Jerusalem, it becomes uniform, completely uniform.

39:42.000 --> 39:50.000
Whether you're in Samaria, whether you're in Judea, in Egypt or in Babylonia, it's all Yah, Yaho everywhere.

39:50.000 --> 39:55.000
This is clearly a cultic reform that was very powerful.

39:55.000 --> 40:05.000
I mean, when you give up your name, okay, when you, if you're from Samaria and all of your, you know, all of your genealogy is all Yo, you know, names.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
And now you change it to Yaho.

40:07.000 --> 40:16.000
And in fact, we have, we found an example in the archaeological record of the same person switching their name from Yo to Yaho.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
And so that, and I mentioned that in the article.

40:19.000 --> 40:29.000
And so that was a major cultic reform among Yahwists in the end of the 7th century and into the 6th century BC.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
Now, this is just a name reform.

40:32.000 --> 40:38.000
We don't see any other, it's not like they had new observances or new, you know, new laws that they had to follow.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
We don't see anything like that at that time period.

40:41.000 --> 40:49.000
But somehow there was a, this idea that we need to form one community across.

40:49.000 --> 41:00.000
And this is, this is probably the result of these waves of exile that started from the end of the 8th century through a little bit to the 7th century and into the 6th century.

41:00.000 --> 41:10.000
All of these waves of exiles and communities leaving, living in different places start wanting to have a more unified identity.

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
And yeah, yeah.

41:14.000 --> 41:25.000
And so they're, okay, so they're going from what we would call Canaan, Judea, Israel, modern day Israel, whatever, Palestine, that region.

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
They're leaving that region because they're being sacked by these Assyrians.

41:29.000 --> 41:35.000
And there's waves of them moving south into Egypt and they're settling in this city called Elephantine.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Island, yes.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
And they're all the way, they're way far away now.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
And they set up in this island there.

41:43.000 --> 41:50.000
And then so what I'm gathered from what you're saying, what other people are saying is like, we have a lot of evidence of what they have.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
We have tons of papayri and we have Ostraca.

41:54.000 --> 42:01.000
We have a ton of evidence and we can look at what these people believed in and what their culture was like to a certain extent.

42:01.000 --> 42:12.000
And so this is where people, this is where things get kind of crazy because the narrative is that these Israelites already had this sort of religion.

42:12.000 --> 42:19.000
This is second, or at the end of the first temple period, so they already know about Solomon and David and Moses and Noah and Abraham.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
And that's, of course, they already know about that stuff.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
And they probably already read Isaiah.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
They probably already know.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
This is what everyone assumes.

42:28.000 --> 42:41.000
So you're thinking these Jews that came down from, or Yahwehs that come down from this region into Elephantine, we're assuming that we're going to find stuff about Moses, stuff about Abraham, stuff about Noah.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Because that's predating the first temple period.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Of course they know this stuff.

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
But what really do we find there?

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
Right.

42:49.000 --> 42:55.000
Of course, none of this predates the Persian period or even the Hellenistic period, I would say.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
I mean, I wouldn't say none of this.

42:57.000 --> 43:09.000
But I mean, I'm sure that the editors and the redactors and even the authors of many parts of the Torah, of the Pentateuch, used older material as well.

43:09.000 --> 43:14.000
So some strands of older material is there, certainly in even going back centuries.

43:14.000 --> 43:21.000
I wouldn't go back as far as, you know, the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age.

43:21.000 --> 43:32.000
But some of the material is certainly older, much older than the Hellenistic period, where these things, according to my research, have been put together.

43:32.000 --> 43:40.000
So, but in Elephantine, it's fascinating what we, the community at Elephantine, as I said, not just Elephantine.

43:40.000 --> 43:52.000
Everywhere, I mean, we, as I said, we have thousands of documents if we combine everything from Egypt to get not just Elephantine and Babylonia and the provinces of Judea and Samaria.

43:52.000 --> 44:00.000
If we combine all of this together and look for the smallest hint of familiarity with the Bible, there is none.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
There's simply none.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
The Bible simply did not exist.

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
So how many thousands, how many texts do we have?

44:08.000 --> 44:12.000
First of all, how big is the sample size of texts that we have there?

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
Can we get some estimation?

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
Is there a thousand texts?

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
Is there 100?

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
Is there 500?

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
What do we...

44:19.000 --> 44:26.000
When I say texts, I mean, I'm combining Ostraca and Papyri together with tablets.

44:26.000 --> 44:35.000
So in the El Yehudu, we're talking about hundreds of tablets, several hundreds in Elephantine and India in general.

44:35.000 --> 44:45.000
So, and of course, all of the numismatic, meaning coins, coins that are also very important, different short names, things like that.

44:45.000 --> 44:53.000
Even Wadi Dahlia, the Wadi Dahlia documents which were found in Samaria in the late fourth century or middle fourth century BCE.

44:53.000 --> 45:02.000
Those are really interesting because these, those papyri that, again, are found in Samaria, written by Samarian Jews, Samarian Yahwists,

45:02.000 --> 45:10.000
are contracts in which Yahwists are selling Yahwists, slaves who are also Yahwists, two other Yahwists.

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
And this, of course, goes against what's written in the Torah.

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
But they are clearly doing something that is completely against the...

45:18.000 --> 45:28.000
We have a lot of examples of things that are completely against the Torah and you can excuse every one of these single examples and start to explain,

45:28.000 --> 45:33.000
well, you know, maybe profit was more important than adherence to the laws.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
You can excuse every single...

45:35.000 --> 45:42.000
But when you look at the totality of the data, okay, it is absolutely...

45:42.000 --> 45:49.000
There's only data of stuff that either is completely ignorant of the Bible or completely goes against it.

45:49.000 --> 46:00.000
But there's not one single piece of evidence that we can point to that says these people were familiar with the Bible.

46:00.000 --> 46:07.000
Nothing. I mean, look, people often ask me, well, what kind of documents do you have at Tel Aviv or in other places?

46:07.000 --> 46:11.000
Most of the documents are legal documents, contracts and things like that.

46:11.000 --> 46:18.000
But we do have personal letters. We have Ostracahs. Ostracahs are like basically the WhatsApp of the ancient world, right?

46:18.000 --> 46:25.000
These are short messages that you give to someone in the market to pass on to someone else.

46:25.000 --> 46:31.000
And so these are kind of the quick communication methods in the ancient world.

46:31.000 --> 46:35.000
And so we have kind of, you know, the equivalent of WhatsApp messages.

46:35.000 --> 46:43.000
We have personal letters. We have contracts. We have formal letters written to...

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
Yeah, a lot of data.

46:46.000 --> 46:52.000
How much time does it span? So you said in the fifth, or is it sixth century BC?

46:52.000 --> 46:58.000
Yeah, about 540, 550 BCE to 399 BC. That's elephantine.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
We're talking two centuries worth of data.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
A century and a half of data.

47:03.000 --> 47:15.000
And according, I mean, my research points to the really good possibility that after that they also migrated up the river, up the Nile to Edfau,

47:15.000 --> 47:24.000
where we have later on in the fourth century, we have a very interesting community of Yaouists as well, right there.

47:24.000 --> 47:33.000
And several concepts that will make it into, quote-unquote, Gnosticism are already found in elephantine.

47:33.000 --> 47:40.000
Especially if you, you know, your channel probably knows a lot about, I mean, dedicated to...

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
I don't know dedicated, but a lot deals with Gnosticism.

47:43.000 --> 47:47.000
You know that the deity, Khnubis.

47:47.000 --> 47:51.000
Khnubis, very popular deity in, especially in Egypt.

47:51.000 --> 47:56.000
It comes from Khnuma, the deity Khnum, that is the main deity of elephantine.

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
Yeah, he's that, that horned ram head.

47:59.000 --> 48:08.000
Ram, that's right, the ram deity from elephantine, and he is the, really kind of the one who dwells in elephantine.

48:08.000 --> 48:17.000
And the first time the form of the name Khnuma changes to Khnubis, the third time we have it recorded,

48:17.000 --> 48:26.000
is in elephantine among the Yaouists there, when they write to the Persian authorities about the attacks on their temple on the island.

48:26.000 --> 48:30.000
So first of all, they had the temple, and I need to tell that to the viewers.

48:30.000 --> 48:39.000
Of course, the Yaouists had a Yaouistic temple on the island that was very similar in size to the description that we have in the Bible for the Solomonic temple.

48:39.000 --> 48:50.000
And yeah, so it was a major, you know, it was relatively major, very little has remained to this day, but we do have, some of it has remained to this day.

48:50.000 --> 49:03.000
We do know where the temple was, and we still, we can see if you visit the island, which I highly recommend, you can see the kind of the pavement of the temple in one wall, or kind of an angle.

49:04.000 --> 49:18.000
In any event, that when they talk, they always throughout their, they often referred, I mean, not often, but they sometimes refer to Khnum in the records from the early 5th century on, they refer to the day to Khnum.

49:18.000 --> 49:25.000
But only when they talk about how the priests of Khnum attacked their temple, then they say Khnub.

49:25.000 --> 49:33.000
Okay, so they move to this term Khnubis, that will become very so popular, as you know, in so called Gnostic circles.

49:33.000 --> 49:48.000
But the first time it is recorded is actually among the Yaouists at Elephantine as a pejorative almost term, because it only in when he attacks, when his priests attacks, attack them.

49:48.000 --> 49:56.000
So that's a fascinating thing that needs to be studied further, of course, but you see elements like that, you see Anat Yaou.

49:56.000 --> 50:17.000
So Anat, the date, the goddess Anat Yaou, which is a kind of a dyad of Anat Enyaou, that in one of my articles about the interpretation of Yudaika in the Achaemeni period, I also, I show that this date, he had a very long life.

50:17.000 --> 50:25.000
And we see that deity as Anat Yaou, also used in amulets and medallions and so called Gnostic medallions.

50:25.000 --> 50:41.000
So a lot of these things that are recorded for the first time in the community at Elephantine, find their way into Yaouistic circles or so called Gnostic circles that are recorded centuries later.

50:41.000 --> 50:48.000
So somehow they were transmitted over the centuries and over the generations on and in the recorded later on.

50:48.000 --> 51:02.000
So this community at Elephantine is extremely important, not just for the study of Yaowism slash Judaism, but also for the study of Gnosticism and again with all my problems that I have with that term.

51:03.000 --> 51:08.000
And so it is a massively important community.

51:08.000 --> 51:15.000
Now, as I said, my research shows that they arrived around in the mid-6th century BCE.

51:15.000 --> 51:24.000
They probably arrived first at Aswan, which is the city facing the island of Elephantine.

51:24.000 --> 51:34.000
Now Elephantine, it's important to understand, Elephantine was a major Egyptian cultic site for thousands of years before the Yaowists came.

51:34.000 --> 51:38.000
Herodotus writes about it too. Herodotus was there when they were there.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
Right.

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
And he doesn't mention them, but he was...

51:42.000 --> 51:46.000
He says there's 12 gnomes, I think he kind of says it.

51:46.000 --> 51:52.000
So there is something, I don't know if that lines up right now, which is a coincidence, but he does say something like that.

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
But you're right. He doesn't say anything about Jews or Yahweh or anything like that.

51:56.000 --> 52:02.000
No, I mean, for him, because he probably saw them as Persians, I mean, for him, they represented the empire.

52:02.000 --> 52:07.000
But Herodotus was there and certainly recorded that.

52:07.000 --> 52:15.000
But my claim is that, and this is what archaeology shows us for the island, is that they first came to Aswan.

52:15.000 --> 52:21.000
Aswan is maybe 100 meters, 200 meters away from the island and it's really close.

52:21.000 --> 52:27.000
And so they came to Aswan, settled there for a while, built the temple on the island.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
That's another mystery we don't really understand.

52:29.000 --> 52:38.000
The only cultic system, the only people that were allowed to build the temple on Elephantine.

52:38.000 --> 52:50.000
Again, Elephantine was, as I said, the major cultic center in Egyptian theology for thousands of years before the Jews came, before the Yaowists came.

52:50.000 --> 52:54.000
And so, I mean, it was believed.

52:54.000 --> 52:59.000
I mean, the reason it was so important is this is the first cataract of the island.

52:59.000 --> 53:07.000
So if you navigate down the Nile, that's where the waters start being unstable.

53:07.000 --> 53:11.000
It's a cataract and you can't really navigate the waters anymore.

53:11.000 --> 53:24.000
So in Egyptian world conception, the waters of the annual inundation of the Nile came from Elephantine.

53:24.000 --> 53:37.000
So they had an idea that there's a well and there are two caves under the island from which the waters flow into the Nile and, in fact, into the entire globe.

53:37.000 --> 53:42.000
And that's the source of the waters for the entire world.

53:42.000 --> 53:46.000
It's sort of like a border of the empire, in a way.

53:46.000 --> 53:51.000
Yeah, I mean, the border of the empire shifted constantly.

53:51.000 --> 53:56.000
But this was, in terms of the waters, this was the source of the waters for the entire...

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
Because it was the first cataract, it was such a big deal.

53:59.000 --> 54:03.000
It is still the first cataract, of course, and it was such a big deal for them.

54:03.000 --> 54:13.000
That was the source of the waters flowing into the Nile and then from the Nile into the Mediterranean, of course, and into the entire world.

54:13.000 --> 54:26.000
It's funny because I was in Elephantine last June and I was sitting there with some of the elders of the island, just a great lunch and just talking.

54:26.000 --> 54:31.000
And they started telling me, of course, they knew nothing about me and my research,

54:31.000 --> 54:39.000
but they started telling me about the well that they have there and how this is the source of the water for the entire world.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
And I felt like Herodotus.

54:41.000 --> 54:46.000
You know, you feel like, I mean, that's exactly what Herodotus heard in his day.

54:46.000 --> 54:52.000
I mean, he heard the elders of the island saying exactly the same legend to him as if it was, you know, that's what they believe in.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
That's fine. I respect that.

54:54.000 --> 55:07.000
Still, for me, I was really moved by this because, you know, you hear firsthand the same story that Herodotus wrote down 2,500 years ago.

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
It's pretty amazing experience.

55:10.000 --> 55:17.000
Anyway, so this island was a major cultic center because of the annual inundation of the Nile.

55:17.000 --> 55:22.000
And therefore, you know, the cult of Khnoum, of the deity Khnoum was so important there.

55:22.000 --> 55:27.000
And it literally affected your, the economy, the entire land of Egypt.

55:27.000 --> 55:39.000
The fact that they allow the Yawists to build a temple that was literally adjacent to the temple of Khnoum is something that we can't really explain sufficiently yet.

55:39.000 --> 55:46.000
But there must have been some very, there must have been some kind of, another term that I'm not a fan of, syncretism.

55:46.000 --> 55:55.000
Some kind of connection that the Egyptians also accepted between Yaw and Khnoum, which is why they would allow that.

55:55.000 --> 56:02.000
But again, this is speculation. We don't really have a convincing explanation for this.

56:02.000 --> 56:08.000
Yeah, and then they continue to live on the island up to, yeah.

56:08.000 --> 56:13.000
Well, that god Khnoum is sort of a demiurgic god. He's depicted as holding the potter's wheel.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
He creates humans. He's very...

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
Which is a thing that you also find in the Bible, right?

56:18.000 --> 56:26.000
Also, not just that, but he also creates man from the earth, right?

56:26.000 --> 56:39.000
And one of his daughter, Anoukis, puts Anoukhet in Egyptian, puts the Ankh into the nose of the people that are...

56:39.000 --> 56:46.000
So that's also very similar to the story in Genesis, of course, that moving life into the...

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
And so, yeah, we see a lot of that happening there as well.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Yeah, wow. That's so fascinating.

56:52.000 --> 56:57.000
No, all right, so we establish who these people are and how important this was.

56:57.000 --> 57:04.000
Now, this is something that I want to highlight because, as I mentioned, you would expect...

57:04.000 --> 57:11.000
If we're looking at the timeline of what we're told, the tradition says, you know, Noah and Abraham and all this stuff, and David, they all predate this.

57:11.000 --> 57:15.000
So, of course, they have to know. There has to be some knowledge of them in these texts, right?

57:15.000 --> 57:24.000
But do we find Noah, Abraham? I know Noah. We find no Joseph or Jacob?

57:24.000 --> 57:28.000
No. Again, not just in Elephantine. Not just Elephantine.

57:28.000 --> 57:35.000
We find no onomasticon, meaning in the list of names for that period in anywhere.

57:35.000 --> 57:42.000
None of the biblical names from the Pentateuch.

57:42.000 --> 57:47.000
I mean, we have names like Nathan, for example, or Hosea and things like that.

57:47.000 --> 57:53.000
We have names like that in Elephantine, but that does not show any knowledge of the Bible.

57:53.000 --> 57:59.000
These are just names that were common at that time and continued being common later on and even today.

58:00.000 --> 58:19.000
But names that are clearly biblical, like the names of the Twelve Tribes, for example, or the names of Aaron and Moses, or the names of the Patriarchs, none of these appear in the onomasticon until the early Hellenistic period.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Yeah, yeah, early Hellenistic period.

58:21.000 --> 58:27.000
That is fascinating. Okay, I don't even know where to...

58:27.000 --> 58:34.000
Well, I mean, I'll take it even further. I'll take it even further. That's relatively easy. Okay, the Pentateuch and all that.

58:34.000 --> 58:42.000
But according to normal biblical chronology, Nehemiah came to Jerusalem in the mid-5th century.

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
With Ezra and Zerubabel, right? That's the story?

58:45.000 --> 58:51.000
Well, yeah, people are debating who came first, Nehemiah or Ezra, etc., and Zerubabel, all of that.

58:51.000 --> 59:04.000
I'm talking specifically about Nehemiah coming to Jerusalem in the mid-5th century and then becoming governor and ruling there for a while, going back to Babylon for a while,

59:04.000 --> 59:11.000
and going back all of these decades, you know, past, and then going back to Jerusalem.

59:11.000 --> 59:27.000
In 407 BCE, so about 40 years after, supposedly, Nehemiah came to Jerusalem, we have two drafts of a letter that was sent to Jerusalem by the people of Elephantine.

59:27.000 --> 59:34.000
Okay, and they sent it to the governor of Judea and to the high priest in Jerusalem.

59:34.000 --> 59:43.000
And so this governor in Judea was either the immediate successor of Nehemiah.

59:43.000 --> 59:55.000
If we suppose that Nehemiah was a historical figure and that he was, and the biblical chronology is correct, then this governor that they are writing to is either the immediate successor of Nehemiah or maybe, you know,

59:55.000 --> 01:00:03.000
the successor of the immediate successor, because we don't know how long the successor, I mean, we don't know exactly what the list of governor was.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:13.000
But it was, but Nehemiah was clearly still in living memory in 407 BCE, if the biblical chronology, the accepted biblical chronology is to be trusted.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Now, what are they asking for in 407 BCE at Elephantine?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:30.000
They are asking the Persian authorities or the representative of the Persian authorities in Jerusalem to help them or to authorize the rebuilding of the temple that was destroyed at Elephantine,

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:36.000
to authorize to them the same thing that basically they authorized Nehemiah to do, right?

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:49.000
I mean, they're asking, the people of Elephantine are asking the same thing that according to the Bible was allowed to Nehemiah, but they don't mention Nehemiah.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
See what I'm saying?

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
It's as if they don't know, I mean, they're talking about their temple.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:08.000
They explain it in great detail how it was destroyed in really great detail, very similar in a sense, although without any knowledge of the description at the end of the Second Book of Kings,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.000
of the destruction of the so-called Second Temple in Jerusalem.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
And they get into a lot of detail.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:25.000
They talk about how their own temple was built before the Persian conquest and it was left intact even under the Persian conquest date.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:31.000
So they have no problem going into the past to provide precedence to their case.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:39.000
They have no problem giving a lot of detail, but they don't mention an almost identical case to their own.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000
That was supposedly happened only a couple of decades, a few decades earlier, right?

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Now, if you are making your case to the Persian authorities and asking them to help rebuild your temple,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:01.000
you would either say, I want you to do to us as you did with Nehemiah, as you did with Jerusalem, I'm asking you to do with us.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
That would really help your case.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Or if we want to just be devil's advocate here, let's assume that in actual historical reality,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:26.000
the whole story with Nehemiah didn't work well and they simply didn't want to remind the Persian authorities of some problems that they had with the rebuilding of the temple.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:33.000
You would at least would need to explain why you would be different, but you can't ignore it, right?

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.000
So the fact that they simply don't mention it, I think is significant.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:52.000
And it shows that there is a very high probability that Nehemiah either did not exist in history or should be dated to the fourth century rather than the fifth century.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:58.000
I mean, the implications for my elephantine are not just with regards to the Pentateuch or Moses and things like that,

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.000
but also with regards to texts that are dated to the fifth century, Ezra Nehemiah and etc.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:17.000
I get told by scholars all the time that be careful using elephantine to draw a holistic conclusion on the period because they're just some fringe people over there.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
What would you say to something like that?

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Well, I mean, we should be careful always with the data.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.000
So that's a very valid point, a very important point that I repeat constantly.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000
The prism of elephantine is not everything, it's certainly not everything.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:47.000
And that's why I always look at other places, so I compare elephantine to other places in Egypt or if possible, or to other locations in the provinces of Samaria or in Babylonia.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
And very often you will find a lot of symmetry.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:57.000
So I look at all of the data that I can and I only reach decisions when I do that.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I don't only rely on elephantine.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
So that's a very valid point.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:09.000
So yeah, so it's true, we shouldn't, but at the same time there is no counter example.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
That's what I'm saying, like what else do you do?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
How else do you test the data?

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
The Bible, the Bible is simply not a reliable historical source.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
We need to understand this.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:26.000
The Bible, I, you know, often people ask me also, well, well, you accept Herodotus and why wouldn't you accept the Bible?

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
What's the difference?

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Now, it's true.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.000
First of all, I have to say, don't accept Herodotus, you know, blind.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Yeah, I always examine it with exactly the same kind of skepticism that we do with the Bible.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
But let me say something on Herodotus.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
People are citing Herodotus right away.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Or even like, for example, Homer, Homer's Iliad, we have Nestor's cup and it quotes Homer on the cup.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
And it's dated to 750 BC.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.000
So we're like, all right, we can put Homer in that time period at least to some degree, maybe not the form that we happen.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.000
But you don't find, there's not like a Moses cup where it cites the words of...

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000
There's nothing from the Bible at all, nothing from the Bible.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Now, they have no problem citing other things.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:17.000
And they had, for example, the Wisdom of Ahikar, which was a very famous book, and they did have that.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
We did find that at the telephony.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.000
They had a copy or a version of the B. Sotun or B. Student Inscription in Aramaic.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
So they had literary texts.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
They had no problem with that.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000
They just didn't have the Bible or any quotes of the Bible.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
They didn't use a geometric expressions from the Bible.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
They write, they are being persecuted.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
So that's really important.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:46.000
In, from around, you know, around 415-ish BCE to when their temple was destroyed in 410 BCE.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:53.000
But they were persecuted, again, not for cultic reasons, for political reasons.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000
But they were persecuted for a while, for several years.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
And then their temple is destroyed.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.000
They write to the governor and the high priest in Jerusalem, by the way, and in Samaria.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:12.000
So both in Jerusalem and in Samaria and the high priest, they write to them, to their co-religionists, without any mention.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.000
I mean, these are Jews persecuted in Egypt, writing to their co-religionists in Judea.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Not a word about the Exodus, about Moses, about something.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:31.000
I mean, again, you would, that's pretty, again, every, every, every story, every element like that,

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000
can be explained away.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
You can say, well, maybe they didn't want to go into that.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000
You can explain everyone independently and excuse it all.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.000
But the, but the overall picture is there is not a single counter example.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Right.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000
So again, yeah, you can excuse all of these, everything that I'm saying inside.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Well, maybe they didn't want to do this.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Maybe they knew about it, but they, they ignored it.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.000
You can explain that, but give me one counter example, one counter example.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
There is none.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
And this is such a good point.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:09.000
And, but even, let's try to explain what do we, so what are they worshiping?

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Are they just worshiping Yahoo?

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Or is there other gods?

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Other gods, definitely.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Yeah.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Other gods.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Can we tell us about what their, their, so they're straight up polytheistic.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
There's no question about that, right?

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Again, another term that I'm not, not, not, not, as you know.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
The term is polytheistic, they're so pro, I agree with you.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000
But just for people who understand these terms.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Right.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.000
They are not, there is no monotheism in the ancient world.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000
I mean, strict monotheism in the ancient world at all.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
It wasn't even a concern.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.000
It wasn't, I mean, and, and strict monotheism, by the way, is an Islamic innovation.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Really the Tauhi, the, the, this uniqueness of, of, of God and absolute monotheism is

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
an Islamic innovation.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:02.000
And so, but, but what they had at Elephantine.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:08.000
So, so their main ethnic deity, the deity that you find in many of, not all of their

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
personal names is Yahweh.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000
And the temple that they built, and they certainly invested a lot of resources into

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
building is the temple for Yahweh.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.000
And they also claim that Yahweh dwells in Elephantine.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Literally he dwells at Elephantine.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
You don't hear that.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I've never heard that before.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
That's something.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000
But they, they literally say that.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:35.000
And so they don't say he doesn't dwell in Jerusalem or in Mount Gerizim or, you know,

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000
in other places, but they say he does dwell there at Elephantine.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Now, and sir, again, the temple is a very, I mean, the temple was, you know, with

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.000
cedar wood ceilings and bronze in doors and stone.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.000
I mean, it was a very sumptuous temple.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:00.000
And, and so that their main deity, certainly the main ethnic deity was Yahweh.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:06.000
But they also make oaths, take oaths in the names of other deities.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:13.000
They also say that, that, that Khnum is against them is attacking them because of

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
something that happened.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
He's like us Satan.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Right.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Right.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Right.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:26.000
And also very interesting really in the last year or two of their time on the island.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.000
We have a fascinating document again in this article that I have on in the

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:36.000
in the Kemeny period, I go into detail on this.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:42.000
There's a, there's a fascinating papyrus long papyrus of contributions that the

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Yahweh's on Elephantine make two shekels, two shekels, two shekels.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
They are making contributions.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
It begins with these.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
This is the contribution for Yahoo.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:59.000
And at the end, after all the accounting is done of all of the, the contributions,

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:04.000
you have a list of the monies that were, I'm just translating in my head, but the

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:10.000
monies that were collected on this day to Yahweh, Anatbet El and Eshimet El.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
So there's a triad.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000
They begin the document with saying this is for Yahoo.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.000
But at the end, they say this amount of money goes to Eshimet El.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
This amount of money goes to Yahoo.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
This amount of money goes to Anatbet El.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000
And in Eshimet El and Yahoo, we get almost exactly the same amount.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
I mean, very, very small difference between the two.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Yahoo gets a little bit more.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.000
But Eshimet El, and there's a discussion, whether it's a feminine deity or a masculine

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.000
deity, Anatbet El is clearly a feminine deity.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000
But this is a triad, a Yahwistic triad.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:53.000
And interestingly, two of those deities are really dyads because Eshimet El is Eshimet

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000
El and Anatbet El is Anatbet El.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:03.000
So you have three or five different deities that are receiving significant contributions

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
from the Yahwists.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000
These are all people, are mostly people with Yahwistic names.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000
By the way, there were Yahwists that had Egyptian names.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000
So we have, or even Persian names.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:24.000
So if the name is Yahwistic, it clearly shows that the person was most probably a Yahwist.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:30.000
But we also have clearly Yahwists who take on Egyptian names.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.000
We have people with Egyptian names who give their sons and daughters Yahwistic names.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.000
We have a Yahwist who gives his son a Beth El name rather than Yahw.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:49.000
So they had, now around 420 BCE, there was some kind of reform on the island.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Very clear reform that changed.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:01.000
I mean, this community has one form before 420 BCE and another form after 420 BCE.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Yeah, and so there was clearly a reform.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I won't get into that because that will probably add another hour to the discussion.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:21.000
But there was clearly a reform that, but in any, in that reform got them a lot closer to the Persian slash Achaemenidz or Astrion or really early Zoroastrian format.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Really interesting.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:34.000
That is again, one of my article on the Incapitatsu Udaika goes in a lot of detail on that is that they say when they talk about the destruction of their temple.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:43.000
One of the documents, they have several documents talking, describing it, but one of the documents talks about a, it says that they brought an offering to Yahweh.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
I mean, it's very fragmentary.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.000
And the line under this, under that says that one Atrodan, that they had an Atrodan there.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Now, Atrodan is in today in Zoroastrian name is in Atashdan in just a different format.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:03.000
But that is the fire holder of Zoroastrian cult.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:08.000
So in their temple, in the Yahweh's temple, they had a fire holder.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Is that an invest in term that you just used?

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Yeah, it's an invest in term.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
That's not a somatic thing.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000
That's an invest in thing.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Absolutely. Absolutely.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Wow.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Now, I've had people say, and this is in my article that is in the book that we're talking about.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000
My paper in that book, it goes into a lot of detail on this.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.000
And some people say, well, you know, it's a fire holder.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.000
A lot of people translate it as a fire altar.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000
I don't use the term fire altar because it is not an altar.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000
It is a holder.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000
There's nothing to sacrifice or offered on it.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Zoroastrians don't offer anything on this.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Yeah, but this is exactly what the Zoroastrians are using to worship.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.000
They're not worshiping the fire, but they're using the fire.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000
That's right.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.000
That is the center of the Yasna, the Zoroastrian cult.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:07.000
So they had this and they use, I mean, if they wanted to just simply say we have something that holds fire,

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.000
not necessarily Zoroastrian, but something that holds fire in the temple,

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000
they could have used the Aramaic, Duda de Noura or something like that in Aramaic.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
But they used the Avestan term.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:25.000
The technical cultic term, the Avestan term in that to describe what they have.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:30.000
So the level of assimilation is there.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:38.000
I mean, when you have in your own temple a Zoroastrian fire holder and you are using that term,

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:43.000
that cultic term, you know what you're doing when you're using this technical term.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Again, if they just wanted to say we have something that holds fire, it's very easy to say it in Aramaic.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
It's really easy.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:59.000
And in fact, in the Talmud where they lived in Sasanian times and they live among Zoroastrians,

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:06.000
they had no problem talking about the fire temple, Bid Noura or Bid Noura.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:13.000
So they have no problem using pure Aramaic to describe what it is without using a Vestan term.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
And Aramaic is the imperial...

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Oh, it's a Vestan slash Persian.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:23.000
It's not purely, I mean, the Atar of Dan is in the Vestan or really Iranian term.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:29.000
But in any case, it's an Indo-Iranian term that is of course also very frequent in the Avesta.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Wow.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Imperial Aramaic is the imperial tongue of the Persians.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
I'm mistaken, right?

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000
It's the imperial tongue.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
I mean, it's the lingua franca of the day.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
It's not a Persian language.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.000
But Persians and Aramaic have a very long story, history together.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.000
I mean, Middle Persian, of course, takes a lot of the...

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000
And that kind of explains why Cyrus the Great is considered to be the messiah

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.000
in some of these later texts that come in the Hellenistic or Persian period, maybe.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Right?

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Is that what you would date Isaiah to, a Persian period text?

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000
What would you say about that?

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Or who knows, right?

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000
It's really who knows.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:15.000
I mean, the Cyrus's renown and his...

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:19.000
I mean, you know that Alexander the Great revered Cyrus.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Yes.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:27.000
And so the fact that someone makes a big deal out of Cyrus does not help date this.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:33.000
I mean, you can have Cyrus as a big name centuries later.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
So that doesn't really help.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:44.000
The question here I would ask as a historian is who has the interest in introducing Cyrus as a messiah?

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000
What was the reason to do that?

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000
That makes sense for a Persian period thing though, right?

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000
No, not just.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
I mean, Cyrus had it was very popular also in Hellenistic times.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
So...

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Yeah, it's hard to say.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000
It's hard to say.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
You know, I don't want to focus too much on that part.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000
I wanted it because I wanted to ask you and I don't want to get too far off.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:12.000
I wanted to ask you, is this just an elephantine's yahoo temple where they're using the fire?

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Or is this also in Samaria?

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Well, excellent question.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000
We don't know.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000
I mean, we know there's only one mention of this fire holder at Elephantine.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Fascinating.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
I mean, the context is really clear.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000
It's the temple.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:30.000
It's also with, you know, in the context of offerings and things like that.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:36.000
It's a fascinating little, but it's very fragmentary, but it does appear very clearly in that fragment.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:43.000
But we don't have, you know, I, my, again, it's purely speculative.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:51.000
But I do think that 420 BCE was a watershed moment in the relationship between the Persian Empire,

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:57.000
the Achaemenid Empire, and the Yahoists all across the empire.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Now, when I started looking into that, I said, well, we see it very clearly at Elephantine.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:08.000
We really see after post 420, which is Darius II.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:14.000
So post 420, we see a major shift and a lot more assimilation with Persian ideals, Persian ideas,

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:20.000
and even going to the, to a really extreme measure, extreme in our eyes,

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:28.000
but a very significant measure of having a fire holder within the temple to Yahweh at Elephantine.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.000
So, and that must have been because it's a relationship with the Yahoists and the empire.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000
That must have been true of all Yahoists everywhere.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Now, if you dig a little bit deeper, the, the temple complex at on Mount Gerazi, which was also Yahoistic, of course,

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:52.000
was constructed around that time, depending on who you talk to.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Some people, David.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:01.000
So the likelihood of it, if it's built around the same time, the likelihood of it having similar features is a lot higher, right?

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Well, I'm not talking about the architecture because the architecture was certainly different.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:11.000
But what I'm saying is that there is an investment because building a temple like this requires imperial, of course,

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
authorization and investment.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:23.000
And so the empire not only, so at that, around that time of the 420 reform, 420 BC reform that is documented very clearly at Elephantine,

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:32.000
we see that the temple in on Mount Gerazi is being sponsored, so to speak, by, by the, the Achaemenid Empire.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:42.000
And a lot of scholars, and I agree with that, claim that the temple in Jerusalem was also built at that time.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:50.000
This is why throughout our talk today, I said so-called second temple because these terms are very misleading.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:57.000
The first temple is simply the first temple that the Bible acknowledges or the Bible talks about.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Clearly, I mean, you know, we know that Jerusalem was an important city over also in the El Amarna period.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.000
There was certainly some temple there, although not the autistic.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:14.000
And certainly there continued to be temples there even after the Bronze Age collapsed and later on.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Because there is no city without a temple in the ancient world.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Simply, there must have been a temple.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:27.000
You can't, even if it's under the, you know, even if it's under the sky, but there's some sacred space within the city.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Okay, so there's, I mean, in the ancient world, it's completely inconceivable to have a city without some kind of temple.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000
A city would simply be not protected if it didn't have a deity protecting it.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.000
So the concept of a city without a temple is important.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000
So there was some kind of temple.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:50.000
And so the whole concept of a first temple is not historical.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
I mean, the concept of a first temple.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:57.000
There was a temple, whether there was the Solomonic, whether it was a historical Solomon is not a question.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Whether this one is a, whether he actually constructed the temple is yet another.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000
But let's say there's this, we call that the first temple.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Then what is the second temple?

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:17.000
When was a, when was another sacred area built or accepted in Jerusalem?

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:26.000
The normal chronology says 516 BCE, according to the chronology that's suggested in the Bible.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:35.000
But that's, that date is simply there in order to provide a 70 year gap between 586 and 560.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
I need that to happen.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:42.000
So you need to have the 70 years because that's, you know, prophecy.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.000
And so that is not established.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000
That's not historical.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:51.000
If I'm looking it against scientifically, I cannot take that as a historical fact.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:22:02.000
And, and then clearly there was something that was built with someone at the time, a Nehemiah or someone like that somewhere in the fifth century.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:18.000
And we know from archaeology that in on Mount Gerizim, which was as Yahuistic as Jerusalem was, there was no difference in terms of authority between, and we do find, we also find the Judeans offering, making offerings on Mount Gerizim.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:29.000
So Mount Gerizim was a completely legitimate temple for Yahuists at the time, not less than, not less so the Jerusalem.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:34.000
And there was also definitely a Yahuistic temple also in the town of Samaria as well.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:40.000
We talk about this in the book that we are, the book of the, that we're actually talking about, supposed to be talking about here.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:48.000
There's also articles that talk about that refer to Samaria and the cultic context in Samaria at the time as well, and they came in the period.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:53.000
So, yeah, so this, we're talking about a very complex picture at the time.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:09.000
And, and we start seeing towards the end of the fifth century BC again, there are people who date the construction of the Mount Gerizim temple to the mid fifth century, based on mostly on coins and things like that have been found.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Coins are not enough to date because you can have a coin that comes from an earlier period.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Simply, there's no reason to switch to a new type of coin so long as the weight of the coin doesn't change.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
So people use coins for a long period of time even after they were issued.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:38.000
So that's not a, these are not good reasons, but I think there are much better reasons to date it to the sec, to the last quarter of the fifth century.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:57.000
And that fits, you know, this Persian support for the, for the Yahweh's and probably the temple in Jerusalem was built in this at the same time, as part of the same, this same policy towards the Yahweh's around the same time.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Now then, and then you have Herod's temple, right?

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Is that the third temple?

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000
You know, if you're talking about the second temple, is that the third?

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:11.000
I've always asked that. I've always, I've always said that too. How do you, and that's funded by justice.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Yeah, so this, this, this terminology of second temple, first temple, this is completely, it's not a scientific, you know, it's not a scientific terminology.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Yeah, yeah. Now, when I first encountered you on the internet, there was, it was actually, this is what, I'll just say what happened, tell the story real quick.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Dan McClellan retweeted a post about the elephantine community was just like the Israelites, they had a Passover and everything.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.000
And I, and I saw this and I just thought to myself, this is so misleading.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:49.000
And I started, so I went in there keyboard warrior style, wait a minute, they don't even mention Abraham, there's no Moses, there's no Noah, there's no Jacob.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
I was like, what are you talking about?

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.000
And I didn't even know that there was a Passover. And then they were like, oh, here's where it says Passover.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:02.000
And it's talking about the letter from 419 from people saying that Darius is allowing us to have a Passover.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:10.000
And then you came in and said, wait a minute, not so fast. It's not the Passover you think the Pesach is being used in a different way.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:15.000
So explain what you meant by this Passover letter is not what people think.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Right, right. Well, that's, that's a huge topic. I'll try to make it short.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:29.000
So the term Pasha, or, you know, the Pesach in Aramaic is mentioned early in the fifth century.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:37.000
So if we're talking about this 420 BCE document that's erroneously called the Passover letter, that's much later, right?

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:47.000
But the term Pasha, this term that is a cognate term to the Hebrew Pesach appears already early in the fifth century BCE in Elephantine.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:59.000
But the problem is that the contexts are not remotely related to what we know of the biblical Pesach.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:08.000
So first of all, it appears only in two slash two and a half Ostraca in all of the Elephantine records.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Either way, real quick, this is all the way at the end of the period too. We're talking 419, but they've already been there for 100 some years.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Yeah, but also the term Pesach has been there already from the beginning of the fifth century. It's something else.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:37.000
And in these two and a half Ostraca, the reason I saying half is that there is another Ostracon that I'm, I refer to in a different article that has a word that combines Pesach with another word.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.000
That's a different story. Let's focus on these two Ostraca that mentioned Pesach.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Clearly, I mean, there is another Ostraca where people suggest that it might because it has a pay, a paying people complete this as best as I don't, I don't, because it's too speculative, I don't really deal with that.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:03.000
But there are two Ostraca where it's clearly, it clearly uses the term Pasha. The first one is a very short Ostracon.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:09.000
I mean, the first one is very short. The second one is actually a very long Ostracon relatively speaking.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:21.000
But the first Ostracon talks about the, about the family, about children being in some kind of danger and the person writing the Ostracon says, keep a close eye on the children.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Don't leave them out. Let them out of your sight until their mother comes. Need the bread until the mother comes. Let and send the news of the children.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:40.000
There's a lot of anxiety in that Ostracon. Clearly the children are in some kind of danger. Maybe there's some kind of epidemic at the time or whatever.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:47.000
There's a lot of anxiety. And then at the end he says, tell me when you're doing the Pesach, the Pasha. Let me know.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Now, the biblical Pasha is one event for which you can never ask when is it going to happen because it's always in the same, the night of the 14th of Nisan.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:05.000
And it's always in the, when the, in sunset, between the evenings, as we mentioned, right?

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:11.000
So the time between the sun starts to set and the time when it's completely set.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:21.000
So the fact that they ask, tell me when you're going to do the Pesach means that it's not set. It's not fixed.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
I didn't even think about that. That was a good point.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:31.000
And by the way, and by the way, real quick, they already have the, from, to my knowledge, I did some research in this for a video I was working on.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:44.000
And there, they already are tons of festivals throughout times in the Assyrian period, the Persian period that celebrates some sort of agricultural rebirth of the sun, New Year festival at this time.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000
And it's usually right around the Nisan 14 day.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Correct. Absolutely. No, the Nisan 14th. So just to finish with the Ostraca, the Ostraca are not related to any specific dates.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
So it's not Nisan 14th or anything like that.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:01.000
They're simply not, it was a completely movable, you know, ritual.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:16.000
And it was probably in the Potropaic ritual, meaning it's something that basically, you know, how to fight evil, how to form exorcism, if you will, or a Potropaic ritual to,

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:21.000
and we have actually an echo of that even in the Bible.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:36.000
In Exodus chapter 12, it says that the, quote unquote, original Pesach was when you put the blood on the entrance to the, you know, to the building, to the house to make sure that the evil does not come in.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:44.000
That is probably the biblical echo of how this Pesach was actually performed.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:52.000
It was basically a ritual that was performed whenever you wanted to make sure that evil does not enter your home.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Okay.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:06.000
And so, again, it's even echoed in the Bible, and it was probably the thing that they did in order to save those children that they mentioned in the Ostracon that were under some kind of danger.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:14.000
I have an article that is about to come out on another Ostracon that mentions Pesach, also a very anxious situation.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:22.000
People are very anxious about some people who are coming to Aswan, to the city that is facing Elephantine.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Elephantine is mentioned in, I mean, the context is also in Elephantine there, and they mentioned the Pesach.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:37.000
We don't really know, it's too fragmentary, the area that mentions where the word Pesach appears, so we don't know exactly what they mean by that.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:48.000
But it is the same context of high anxiety, something that is, I mean, before the text on this Ostracon prior to the word Pesach appears,

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:58.000
is this some kind of letter that they receive, and they really, really need to understand it well, so they send it to some other person to explain it,

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:02.000
and then they send it to another person to explain it, and they really need to understand what's going on,

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:12.000
because some really important people are going to come to Aswan on that day, and so there's a clear sense of anxiety, and again the word Pesach appears.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:24.000
So my sense is that Pesach, in the beginning of the first century, Pesach has nothing to do with the use of its biblical cognate,

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:36.000
but it's simply some ritual that was enacted to combat evil, to make sure that evil does not attack you, does not...

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.000
So that's, and again, it's echoed in the Bible as well.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:51.000
The Passover is a debatable etymology, but the idea that this is something that you put blood on the entrance to your home to make sure that evil does not come in,

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:57.000
that seems to be the actual original ceremony that was not fixed in time.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:08.000
And this letter from 419, coming from the Jews under Darius, doesn't say anything about a lamb, or...

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
It doesn't use the term Pesach, Pesach.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.000
It doesn't even use the word Passover, they call it a Passover letter, but it doesn't even use the word Passover.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:19.000
It doesn't use the word Passover, or Matzah, or Matzot, you know, or Unliving Bread.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Oh, it doesn't mention Unliving Bread? I thought it did, doesn't it?

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000
No, it doesn't.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
So there, there's assuming that it does.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.000
You're right. I mean, that's just the restoration that was done.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Ah, see, this is blowing my mind.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:35.000
So, all right, so to wrap this all up, this is crazy.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Let me actually go a little bit further.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:56.000
So my, my chapter in this book that we're talking about goes into is a very detailed epigraphic analysis of this papyrus, so-called Passover letter.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Again, a very erroneously called the Passover letter, but I'm providing a very detailed epigraphic analysis line by line, word by word.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:10.000
And also, then I provide the context that I think it really should reflect.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Now, what's really interesting is that if we remove all of the proposed reconstructions.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:27.000
I mean, Zachau, the German scholar from the, who published it initially in 1903, the first one to publish this papyrus.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:34.000
He said that he was able to reconstruct this to understand this papyrus based on Deuteronomy in Exodus.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.000
That methodologically is unacceptable to us today.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000
I mean, this is one of the great scholars of the beginning of the 20th century.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:49.000
But today, if someone would tell me, I was able to restore this based on Deuteronomy in Exodus, I have a methodological problem with that.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:55.000
You can't do that, right? You have to establish first that there was such a thing as the Passover in the 15th century this year.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Or that there was a Deuteronomy.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Or there was exactly.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Because no one's mentioning, no one ever mentions Deuteronomy ever until-

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
That's right. That's right.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:16.000
And so, but not only is Passover not mentioned or unleavened bread, but there are no prohibitions on anything at all.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Okay, in the reconstructions that certain scholars have done over the years, they restore, do not eat, do not drink, right?

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
But it's only, it's only restoration.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:44.000
The actual papyrus, and I did go to Berlin and studied it in person, you know, and took microscopic, I mean, microscopic infrared photo and multi-spectral photos of each word independently in and studied it.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.000
They made sure that I'm reading this as scientifically as possible.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000
There is simply no pro, nothing is prohibited.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
There is no do not eat, do not drink.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000
But drinking is very central to that document.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Drinking something, and it says be pure, keep yourselves pure.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:09.000
He does not describe what he means by be pure, by the way, which is really important.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.000
So clearly they understood what he meant.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:19.000
The person writing this extremely important document is called Hananya.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:23.000
And they clearly understood what he meant by being pure.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
He didn't have to explain to them what that means.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000
And then in the next line after that, he says drink something.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
He doesn't say don't drink.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:36.000
He says drink something and then, you know, continues with it.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:43.000
But so clearly there was something really important about drinking something on that document.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Again, I make all kinds of proposals in my...

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Maybe the Haoma drink, right?

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Okay, so you do know what I'm saying.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:01.000
So yeah, my suggestion is that this was a Haoma drink.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.000
The Yazna, so Yazna is the...

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Real quick, just for anyone who has no idea what that is, what is the Haoma drink?

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:12.000
I mean, I'm not in any rush to finish as long as you're not.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Okay, great.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:20.000
So the Yazna is the large Zoroastrian ritual.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Beautiful, impressive, fantastic.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.000
I really recommend that people go and check.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:33.000
There is a website called the Multimedia Yazna where you can actually see it in an interactive video

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:37.000
that was created by SOAS University in London.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Amazing project and a lot of information about the Yazna ceremony.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Yazna is not a festival.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:49.000
It's kind of like a Catholic mass or Orthodox Christian mass.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
It happens every day.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Every day there is a Yazna and it also happens for special occasions.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:01.000
So it's simply the liturgy that happens constantly.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000
It's several hours long, by the way, in the Zoroastrian liturgy.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
So that's the Yazna.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:16.000
We know that the Yazna, so with the Passover, as we said, there is simply no records of it extra biblically.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:21.000
But we do have records of the Yazna in the Achaemenid period.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Okay, we have pictographic representations in the Achaemenid period in Persepolis and other places

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:37.000
where, in several places across the empire, that show clearly that the Yazna was already practiced in the Achaemenid period.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:43.000
So we have on one hand the Passover that is simply not documented anywhere,

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:48.000
or this Yazna which is amply documented in the Achaemenid period.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Now, in the pictographical presentations of the Yazna in the Achaemenid period,

01:37:53.000 --> 01:38:00.000
we do have the preparation of the halma drink represented on these inscriptions,

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.000
which is a mortar and a pestle. That's how you press the halma.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Okay, that's how you make the halma drink.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
That is a major part.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.000
In the Yazna, it happens twice in the Yazna ceremony.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:15.000
And that's what you make this drink, which is an intoxicating drink.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.000
It doesn't make you drunk, but it's...

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:23.000
It's like the Kaikyan of the Greeks, but it's also like a soma for the Indians.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
For the Indians, exactly.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:32.000
And it has, I mean, in certain places it is repressed by wine, actually, because it's also pressed and also intoxicating.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:37.000
And we see it also in China. I mean, there are also later communities in China.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Does it have psychedelic properties? I've heard that before. Do we not know?

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:44.000
We really don't know what exactly was the halma at the time.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:51.000
What Zoroastrian or Hindus today use as the soma, it's probably a very different...

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:56.000
So we don't really know what it is that they actually used. It's also being debated.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:04.000
But what we do know is that the Yawista community at Elephantine assimilated deeply.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.000
I mean, we talked about the fire holder, right?

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Deeply assimilated Zoroastrian elements into their own cultic sphere, right?

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Now, this document that is erroneously called the Passover letter is much closer in what it describes to the halma, to the Yassna ceremony than to the...

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Of course, to anything that we know from the Passover.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Now, the date, the only thing that the main reason that people refer to this as the Passover letter is because it refers to an observance that starts on the 15th of Disan and goes on for seven days.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Now, the thing is, the 14th of Disan is simply the first...

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:57.000
The 14th and the night between the 14th and the 15th of Disan is simply the first full moon of the year.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Disan is the beginning of the year and it's the first full moon of the year.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.000
And it's the beginning, it's the sign for the beginning of the harvest.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:12.000
So in the ancient world, the first full moon of the year was a major event.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:18.000
In the ancient world, people need to understand because in the modern world, we don't understand just how precarious life was.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:25.000
But in the ancient world, you live or die based on the results of the harvest, of just how much you got from the harvest.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
It keeps you alive for the next year.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Now, if in the end, towards the end of Disan and that time period of spring, when the harvest begins, if your deity rains hail or floods or thunderstorms,

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000
all of that, that can literally kill you.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:50.000
That could destroy families, could destroy villages.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:53.000
And so that period was extremely important.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:59.000
And the first full moon of the year in Disan was a period of trepidation.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:08.000
You're really concerned, you're worried about the immediate future and you want to make sure that this harvest is important.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:16.000
So all across the ancient Near East, the 14th of Disan was a major, major date.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Let me just, let me just, so people whom you might not understand.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.000
So 14 days after Nisan won, which is a lunar calendar.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000
So the first of Nisan would be a new moon.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
14 days later would be the first full moon.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Is that how we would do it?

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:35.000
And so no matter what the situation is, we have a solar calendar.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:42.000
So our calendars sort of just are like automatic every 12 months and 365 days in a year.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:49.000
But they had to tune their calendars to line up with the moon so that on the first of every month would be a new moon.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000
So it's really lunar solar calendar.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:57.000
You know, you adjust it with the sun and it's a lot more complicated.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:01.000
It's more complex, but it served its purpose, certainly in the ancient world.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Calendars in the ancient world is another fascinating topic.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
And Nisan was the first month?

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
The first month of the year, right.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Here we go.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000
So Nisan 14, by the way, that's the day Jesus crucified on.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Nisan 14 happens to be the first full moon of the year.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Wow.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:22.000
It is every year the first full moon of the year.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
And it is the beginning of the harvest.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Okay.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:36.000
You know, and so, and so that, that is a major, really important day where people really did everything they can to make sure that the deities are not not angry with them.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
The Assyrians had a big festival.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
The Assyrians had called the Kisu Festival.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Huge festival was a week long.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:49.000
And they sell, they actually did, I have an academic paper who wrote about this in my folder here.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:57.000
And they had 72 gods under Dagon was the head of the Pantheon.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:01.000
And they all got dedicated to them a lamb sacrifice.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.000
So there is a lamb sacrifice happening in this time by the Assyrians.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Now the Persian period, I don't know if they did something different, but we're talking.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Let me just ask you this.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Do you think it's safe to say that whatever was going on in the Persian period for this festival was being adopted by Elephantines, Samaritans, all these different groups of people?

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Well, it wasn't, it simply wasn't a festival yet.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
It was a one-time observance.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:32.000
You know, this happened in 419 BCE, this particular letter, really at the beginning.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
So this is 420.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:40.000
I mean, the letter was sent in the first two weeks of Nisan because he says, this year you should do this.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:48.000
So he's, the year begins in the sun first, and he's talking about something that should happen on the sun 15th.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:55.000
So clearly he's writing this somewhere in the first and the 15th of the same year.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:58.000
What's the brand new observance that they're introducing?

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Well, again, it's not necessarily an observance.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:12.000
I think it's really a, the reason that they wanted to do that, because we already talked that there was some kind of, of close relationship between that started around 420 BCE, between the Achaemenid period.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
And we talked about Mount Gerizim.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:17.000
We talked about, you know, about the fire holder.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:21.000
We talked about, you know, and we see it also in coins from that period.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:32.000
There's a lot more, a lot of, that the imperial Achaemenids were started around 420 to be very close to the, to the Yahwehs at the time.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:50.000
I think that this particular document is the document where, because in order to be close, to be promoted as a, as a, as a people group, as an ethnic group, to be promoted to be being part of the dominant ethnic class.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
You have to be pure.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:00.000
And in order to be pure, in the Zoroastrian view, in order to be pure, you drink the halma.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:06.000
The halma purifies you cosmically, according to their, to their understanding.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
It is, it really recreates you.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
And Herodotus talks about this as well.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:25.000
So, so I think that this, this document really describes their kind of a ceremony of becoming a part, an organic part, if you will, of the Achaemenid Empire, rather than anything related to the, to the Passover.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:34.000
But I do think that the Passover decades later is based on the Zoroastrian Yassna.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:42.000
And that was the first time it was kind of done and connected from to the dates of that festival.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:57.000
But, but, you know, a ceremony is where you have pressed a drink made out of pressed, you know, natural ingredients that is also intoxicating and unleavened bread.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:01.000
There are only two rituals that I know of that have that.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:06.000
The Passover and the Zoroastrian Yassna.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.000
So the Zoroastrian Yassna also has unleavened bread.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Yeah, I know.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:23.000
I mentioned this in one of my recent videos about, I did a whole video about, you know, the spring equinox festivals, norus and yassna and quisu and Passover Easter.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:32.000
And that was one of the things that I ran into in the, in the academic papers was that the unleavened bread was a big deal for the Persians.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.000
That's right.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:38.000
It is to this day, the Zoroastrian still have, we call it the drone, which just means a portion.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:45.000
The drone initial in the Avesta drone is actually an animal sacrifice in the, in the Avesta.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:51.000
But I think, and I think that I can also show it from archeological records in, in Persepolis.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
That's a different story.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:47:04.000
But I think that when the Zoroastrians became, had an M started having an empire, early Zoroastrianism with the Achaemenid Empire.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:08.000
When you have, starts having Zoroastrians across the empire.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:21.000
It becomes really just unmanageable to have them offer, you know, animal sacrifice everywhere they go, especially if you have an entire military of Zoroastrians that have to travel.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:28.000
It really becomes, you know, extremely expensive and heavy to have animals for sacrifice travel with you.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:45.000
And I think that the, that the shift from animal sacrifice in, and again, this is speculation, but it makes a lot of sense in imperial times to shift from animal sacrifice to an unleavened bread in the Achaemenid period rather than, than, than later on.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:57.000
And I think this is also supported in, in some ways in, in Persepolis and in pictographic representation of the Yazna, because in the pictographic representations of the Yazna ritual.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:03.000
As I said, you have the pestil and the mortar where you crush the, the Alma and make the drink.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:11.000
You have a, you often have the sponsor of the ceremony represented and the, and the one of the priests represented there.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:27.000
But you never have, it doesn't, it never shows like a head of an animal sacrificed or a, you know, some body part of an animal sacrifice, which you do have for in representations in other, in other cults.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:42.000
So, so you don't, it never shows, shows that, I mean, sometimes there are, there are some cases where it does show that, but it, but in most cases in the main representations that we have, we don't see that.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:51.000
And so I think that that was the period of transition from animal sacrifice, maybe in Persepolis, they still did animal sacrifice, but across the empire, they didn't.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:49:00.000
So that was a period that makes a lot of sense for transition into, into a unleavened bread already in the Achaemenid period in Zoroastrianism.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Wow, we just covered so much in this is very fascinating.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:15.000
So if I just wanted to run an idea by you and you can say if this would be accurate or not based on what you've concluded or based on your research.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:34.000
If I was to say like what we consider to be Judaism today is actually just kind of an evolution of ideas starting back in the, you know, obviously, going back as far as we know, but progressing through the Persian period, and then even more so in the Hellenistic period when you start getting Bible.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Is that safe to say that it's not like the exact traditional account more of an evolution of ideas progressing?

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Well, every, yeah, every cultic system, every religion is progression constant progression.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Yeah, and, and, and what's really important to understand is the, the Jews were never different from other systems.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:12.000
And I mean, they were, I had this article, I don't know if you if you saw about this priestess in Elephantine that was also published, I mean, National Geographic to the thing about it as well.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:21.000
And where I actually found evidence, clear evidence of a priestess serving in the Yahweh temple at Elephantine.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:26.000
And fascinating little ostracon that, that I had to hunt down.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Anyway, so the, this, this, I mean, normally you would think that the that there was no priestesses, there were no priestesses in Judaism, it's only only male priests.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:42.000
That's the image that you get from the biblical, most of the biblical text.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
I mean, if you dig enough, you can see echoes.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:51:00.000
We, there are, there were Jewish priestesses, not only in Elephantine, but also in Egypt, in the, in the second century, first century BCE, and then in Rome, in, I mean, there are priestesses, Jewish priestesses and many actual priestesses in Judaism as well.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:04.000
But you never hear of that in the Bible.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Or, or directly in the Talmud, I mean, there are echoes that you might be able to interpret also there.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:20.000
But many scholars say, well, what was unique about Judaism is that they did not have priestesses.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:28.000
You read that many, many scholars say that they say everyone did, but the Jews didn't have female, you know, didn't have priestesses.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
But they did.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:40.000
You see what I'm saying? If we, if we only look at the biblical image, it gives us a completely distorted image of, of reality on the ground.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Because it's, these are, I mean, again, the Bible, I'm not, I'm not, I want to make sure that people understand I'm not against the Bible and not coming.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:58.000
It's not, I'm not trying to, to, to, to, to, but, but we need to understand the Bible and going back to the point I was making earlier on about the Herodotus versus the Bible as a historical source.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Certainly very skeptical of a lot of what Herodotus says.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:11.000
But the big difference between Herodotus and the Bible is that no one had his, his or her identity defined by Herodotus ever.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.000
No one say I'm a Herodotian.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Okay, no one had to know it was not a defining text.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:23.000
The Bible is, the Bible is defines your identity.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:32.000
And so we have different sects, different schools of thought, each one inserting their own ideology into what eventually became the biblical text.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.000
The Bible is this huge battleground of ideas.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Okay.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:42.000
And it is, it's not concerned primarily or even secondarily with history.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:58.000
It's concerned with, with expressing those ideas with expressing theological and mythological ideas on on how the, you know, going back to the Exodus that we talked about at the beginning.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:13.000
The idea of a nation of a group of people of her ethnos coming from the East was central to Greco-Roman thought, Hellenistic and Greco-Roman thought.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:28.000
If you wanted to represent your people, your, your, your, your ethnic background as something ancient, something, you know, respectable, something that is, that is, you know, that has a lot of long history behind it.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:35.000
You would, in the ancient world, you would explain, you would provide some kind of mythology on how it came from the East.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:53.000
This is true of the Greeks in some, some of the Greek poly nation states represented themselves as being founded by definitions coming from the East and found in them there, but also Rome, at one of the heights of its power,

01:53:53.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Auguste commissioned, exactly. He commissioned Virgil to create the mythology of how Rome was, was founded by Aeneas from, from Troy, who traveled from the East to, and this is exactly the same idea with the, with the story of the patriarchs coming from Abraham and then having

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:27.000
each one of his children go back to the East and to bring a bride from the East and, and reestablish them. So coming from the East, this origin, this origin from the East is, is, is so Hellenistic.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:33.000
The Heraklidae coming from the, the Lydians, they claim descent from Heracles.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.000
That's right.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Edgibeton Thebes, they're from Cadmus, who's a Phoenician.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Cadmus, exactly Phoenician.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Yeah.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Yeah, they're all this, still claiming descent from some sort of demigod.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Yeah.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:46.000
I mean, even the name Cadmus just means East, right?

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Right.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Right.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Yeah.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Alphabet too.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:55:04.000
But also this ties to the Exodus, this ties to the Exodus because, you know, the Exodus is, is taking this idea of, of a, of going from Egypt and then entering the land from the East, which makes no sense.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:14.000
I mean, they enter, they go all around from Moab and, you know, in, in, in Edom and they have to go and enter from the East.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Again, the same kind of meeting the same, the same place around Shechem, where, where Abraham entered the land as well.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:33.000
So, so you see that there's a, there are two narratives of how the people came from the East, one from the patriarch, one from the, the root of the Exodus.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:43.000
All of this is perfectly aligned with Greco-Roman, certainly a mystic, you know, ideals.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Yeah.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.000
And so, yeah, and we see that.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:51.000
I mean, it is, when you know the context, it's so clear as well.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:56.000
I mean, you know, a lot of people ask themselves, why did they have to go all the way around?

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:59.000
It doesn't make any sense to go all the way around.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:06.000
And yeah, well, you want to, you want to establish this Eastern, you know, Eastern Providence.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Providence, right.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:12.000
And that's, and that's, it's actually fascinating.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:17.000
When you look at the truth, sometimes it's more fascinating than the tradition.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Yeah.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Always.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:20.000
Yeah.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:21.000
That's what gets me up in the morning.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:30.000
For me, researching this, it's always about lifting the hood and looking, what is the reality on the ground?

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Now, again, as I started saying, I'm not anti-bible or anything like that, but the beauty of the Bible,

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:40.000
what makes it so beautiful in many parts of it, and all of terrible parts as well.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:49.000
But in many parts of it, what makes, what gives it, its power is simply a question of geography.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Because, you know, the provinces of Judea and Samaria between the Bible was kind of written between the two or composed between these two.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:12.000
That's where every military power, every empire had to go past through that region and leave its imprints in that region.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:23.000
And so the Bible is basically a story of humanity, of how humans left their imprint in this one bridge between Africa, Asia and Europe.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:45.000
And that's what gives this text, its power, really, that every, all of ancient humanities, at least in these continents in Africa, Asia and in Europe, left an imprint that is discernible in this corpus.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Yeah, and it's almost like you're getting this tapestry of different layers of different time periods.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.000
You've got the archaic layer that's in there somewhere.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:58:00.000
And then you have, as you mentioned, the Persian, Zoroastrian influences start to trickle into the text.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:11.000
And then you get this later Hellenistic layer of influences and, you know, the pre-Socratics with their monism and dyads and all that stuff, it starts to get pushed into the text.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:19.000
And so you have a tapestry of different centuries of time periods, different influences, and it's being sewn together.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:27.000
This could only happen to this extent in that region just for reasons of pure geographic reasons.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:38.000
But all of these different sort, you know, you have the Persian Empire that brought ideas and influences from India as well.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:42.000
And of course, from Iran, I mean, the Iranic peoples.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
And you have the Greeks and you have the Egyptians.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:51.000
So you have everything converging in that local area, this little, tiny little area that absorbed from all of them.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:55.000
And that is what eventually produced this corpus.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:59:00.000
I mean, what's beautiful about it is the humanity of it.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:09.000
And just all of these different cultures coming together, leaving an imprint and moving on.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
And this was absorbed.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Now, again, it was absorbed somehow.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:24.000
But it was completely unknown to most Yahoists, or practically almost all Yahoists, up until the Hellenistic period.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:29.000
I mean, imprints were left, but they were not widely known.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:44.000
And in that change, this is another book that I'm also working on, that changed with the Museum in Alexandria.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:55.000
I mean, what people need to understand, I mean, Ptolemy I and Alexander III, they grew up together.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
I mean, they were childhood friends.

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
They both were students of Aristotle.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Exactly.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:08.000
And when they founded Alexandria, the idea was to implement Aristotle's ideals.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:14.000
And so the city was well planned with, you know, with the grid of streets.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:17.000
I mean, a very modern city.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:26.000
The temple was had, you know, the doors were automatic in opened up automatically because of hydraulic.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:36.000
You know, when you when you walked on the on the on the kind of the platform leading to the temple, the hydraulic pressure would cause the doors to open up.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:41.000
And so people, this was the high, this was like Silicon Valley of the engine world.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:46.000
I mean, this is what where you want, if you want to go to the to the cutting edge technology of the time, you want to go to the.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.000
To where things are are done.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
You go to Alexandria.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Now, Ptolemy the first created his palace in Alexandria and around surrounded it with the temple in the museum.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:09.000
The museum was just a place of the muses and within the museum you had the museum you had the famous library of Alexandria.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:14.000
And it was the first library in real library in the world.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:22.000
People often say, well, there are libraries before the library of Alexandria, like assure by Nepal and other, but these were archives.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
These were not libraries.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:28.000
This is where you would put different texts, administrative texts, but also literary texts.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:35.000
You would put them in an archive to conserve them or to teach scribes how to, you know, how to learn their profession.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:36.000
But these were archives.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:45.000
These were not libraries are different between an archive and the library is that an archive is for to conserve or to use as material to teach scribes and things like that.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:02:04.000
But it is not a place to study texts critically, which is really kind of what Aristotle wanted his followers wanted to do, and to find where different manuscripts of the text don't disagree with themselves or where the same manuscript has all kinds of, you know, disagreements.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Disagreements within its own text.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:14.000
And so starting to critically study study text, that is what happened in Alexandria.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:24.000
And we see that also the same methodology also applied in the Bible, addition, redaction, et cetera, et cetera, following the same idea.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:40.000
Now, historically, it is so clear and so conspicuous that up until, you know, the library was established late really the tail end of the fourth century beginning of the third century BCE in Alexandria.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Up until that moment, we see no, as I said several times already today, zero evidence of any type of knowledge of the Bible anywhere in any of the Jewish diaspora,

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.000
whether in Egypt, Babylonia, Judea, Samaria, et cetera.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
No one knows anything.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
There are no names that are related to the Bible.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:01.000
There are no nothing.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:02.000
No one.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
It's simply not inexistent.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:07.000
This changes at the beginning of the third century.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:12.000
So clearly we start seeing those names appearing in the, in the list of names and you know, must take on.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:26.000
We start seeing, you know, people like, you know, whatever text that we have there, we start seeing people at that time around the time of the museum.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:31.000
People start knowing something about the Bible, referring to the Bible.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:36.000
It, I mean, it is so clear that there was a shift around that time.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:40.000
And as a historian, I look for triggers.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:46.000
What may, what causes something causes change in history and you need to find the trigger.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:54.000
And the trigger, I mean, the, the, the, this library in Alexandria is such a clear trigger, such a major trigger.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:04:05.000
And you see it in the archeological records so clearly there's nothing before and every, and it starts after that I think it's, I mean, it's really hard to argue with that.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:11.000
This is what I've been saying for as long as I started to discover some of this information.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:24.000
And then obviously we get the Septuagint translation coming a little bit later, but it doesn't seem like the construction or the creation of Genesis, for example, let's just take Genesis by itself.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Doesn't seem to be, have been constructed that much earlier, maybe less than a century before at some point.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:36.000
Even decades.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
We talked about Virgil.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.000
It took him 10 years to write the Annihats.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Okay, it took him 10 years, one person, and the Annihats in terms of their, of their length, I mean, it's about the same size as the Pentateuch.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:56.000
So it's one person, 10 years to write the equivalent of the Pentateuch.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:59.000
Now, Virgil also used earlier sources.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:02.000
He did not come up with the idea of Annihats coming from the East.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:06.000
It was already very popular in Rome before him.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:11.000
There were earlier sources, and one person did that in 10 years.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:20.000
There's the Sean Amé, which is much later, of course, but Ferdowsi who wrote the Sean Amé, which is like the great Iranian epic.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Beautiful.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:25.000
I highly recommend the viewers to check that out.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:38.000
The Sean Amé is 150, I mean, it's like 1.5 times greater than the, the entire Bible, including the New Testament.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:43.000
I mean, the Old Testament and New Testament times, you know, 1.5.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:46.000
One man wrote that in 30 years.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:51.000
So 30 years of one man is the equivalent of 1.5, the entire Biblical call was.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:55.000
And, and also he used earlier material as well.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Okay.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:10.000
And, and, but he, but this was so people can write this if there is a, if there is, if the right trigger exists and there is the right motivation, people can write this corpus very, very quickly.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:14.000
It's not, it's not, it happened in.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:24.000
And when we look at, and I look at Genesis, for example, it seems to be similar in its, in its construction to other theogonies,

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:36.000
slash Genesis stories, creation myths of the time period where you have a God who's a Demiurgic creator and he takes it makes heaven and earth, our nose and Gaia, which is what you see in like theogonies.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:40.000
And it's sort of Ferricides has a different version of this.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Appellodorus has a different version.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
They're all, they're all contemporary.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Plato, Plato with the Timaeus.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
That's what I was just going to say.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:54.000
What, what we get in Genesis seems to be more platonic, maybe not exact.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
I think it's influenced by platonic.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:57.000
What would you say?

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Well, it's hard to know.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.000
I mean, it's not exact.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Of course, it's not one to one.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
It's not exactly the same.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:03.000
There are some certain elements.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:09.000
I think it's influenced, it's heavily influenced as is Plato himself by Persian, by Persian.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:10.000
He admits this.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:13.000
He says that he says that Pythagoras was taught by Zoroaster.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:14.000
That's right.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:32.000
So they're all, they're all borrowing from each other, but it seems to be in this particular period where you start to see all these ideas of, of a single perfected, not perfect, but like, you know, some sort of eternal Demiurgic power who's above all the daemons.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Well, I mean, you have that in, in, in, in Egyptian, in the Egyptian worldview for, you know, millennia before that.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:43.000
So, I mean, it's not exactly necessarily new.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:51.000
The question is not it's so again, as a historian, you look for triggers, you don't see a historical trigger for that necessarily.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Then if, if you don't see a trigger, what you need to do is start looking at at individual, you know, data points within the text to see, are they closer to the Egyptian model or to the.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Persian model or to whatever.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:13.000
So you need to start analyzing because there is no trigger you started to start analyzing the data as per se and seeing what, what, what, what it relates to more.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:25.000
It's really interesting because a lot of the ancient ideas like that have a very, very lengthy time, you know, very shelf life.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Okay.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:37.000
They were therefore, you know, some ideas are, you know, you find them in Sumerian texts, and they, and they appear also in, in Hellenistic Babylonia.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Okay.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:49.000
And so you, a lot of these texts are very often scholars in my field, unfortunately, they say, well, this looks like something from, you know, that we find in the new Assyrian text.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
And therefore, I will date it to the new Assyrian.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
That is extremely simplistic.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:09:08.000
When I do that with Amos, I mentioned that earlier, when I do that with Amos, I show how just the level of detail where he uses idiomatic expressions that would be lost on people in later centuries.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:16.000
But so that's why I date, I can date the text really quickly, but I only really precisely, but I only date.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:21.000
I'm trying to be really, really cautious and really scientific about this.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:34.000
When I can see clear parallels that are indisputable between these corp, the different corpora that where you can actually make that connection.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:42.000
But otherwise, you know, it's really hard to date these texts in any, in any, you know, in any really precise form.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:45.000
And we should, we should be extremely cautious with that.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:56.000
It's, it's overly simplistic to say, for example, they mentioned Cyrus, so clearly it was written during the lifetime of Cyrus, for example, or that is simply not.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:04.000
I had, I had an even worse argument thrown at me about Genesis predating, or this, this is what I'm not going to name names.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
I don't want to, it's been a friend of mine.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:07.000
He's a good scholar too.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:12.000
But in this particular thing, he really threw me, I was like, what?

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Well, I'll tell you what he said.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:20.000
I go, can you find anyone that's citing Genesis in the prophets, for example, or any, because I'm trying to find out when was Genesis written?

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:21.000
I think it's Hellenistic.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:27.000
But I asked him, I said, what can you find anyone citing Genesis or quoting from Genesis?

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:28.000
And I just asked him this question.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
And he said, yes, Isaiah does.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:37.000
And then he gives me a passage from Isaiah that has one word in common with one word from a sentence in Genesis.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
They're not even talking about the same thing.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:40.000
One of them was about creation.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:41.000
The other one was about destruction.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.000
They're opposites.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:49.000
And I go, wait, so you're saying that this one word in common with this sentence makes him, I go, that's not a citation.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:54.000
You know what, let's, let's, even if you said to me, this is not up for debate and left.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Okay, so that's, that, that person is clearly not thinking scientifically.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:12.000
But, but you know what, even for the sake of discussion, let's say we find in Isaiah or wherever in Jeremiah, doesn't matter where an actual reference to the garden of Eden, whatever, with actual verbatim quotes.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
What does that mean?

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:15.000
Nothing.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
Strictly nothing.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Because it could be edited.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:25.000
Well, I was going to say, then you have to wonder, is this one coming after the other one now?

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Well, but, but even that is mean is meaningless.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:40.000
I mean, the question, the point is that we know that the biblical text underwent so many, you know, hands editing and redacting it.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:44.000
We know from Qumran that sometimes they change just one word.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:12:05.000
What am I, if your unit is just the single word, and you can't even date, you don't know when that word was written and added to the text, the text, you know, the text of Jeremiah, the text of Joshua was still was still in flux in the first

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:12.000
century, see, Josephus had a different version of Joshua than what we are familiar with.

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:21.000
Yeah. And so we have, I mean, first, that's first century CE, you know, and the text of Joshua is still in flux.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:22.000
Okay.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:39.000
So, I mean, knowing how the Bible was constantly, I mean, it was a text, a living text that will be people still, you know, still edited and adapted to their own ideologies.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:52.000
Throughout the first centuries, BC and into the first century CE, you know, it was a still a highly debated and very, very much still a battleground at that time.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:13:02.000
So knowing this, it is very easy to add references like we mentioned earlier to Hosea in to the Exodus in Hosea.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:03.000
Right.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:16.000
And if I want to make, and by the way, the, the people in Alexandria, the Greeks or the Macedonians in Alexandria, did the same thing with to the Greek to Homer and Hesiod and others.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Right. They, they edited the text and when they, when they saw contrasts and contradictions between the texts, they made sure that they to correct those texts and may and add and change a word here, change a paragraph there.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
They did that with the Greek texts.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:41.000
And of course, also the Jewish redactors, editors of the Bible did the same there as well.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:46.000
It was obvious it was natural to do.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:57.000
You know, the people in Qumran, for example, had no problem writing texts with the same believing that they have the same authority as the as the authors of the biblical texts.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:05.000
You know, it's not, or not in Qumran, but at least the writings that were preserved in Qumran.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:14.000
And so, yeah, and so the biblical texts, it was alive. It was something that is a living document that people are still writing.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:18.000
It was not yet fossilized. It was not yet canonized.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:33.000
And it was, it was a living documents with a document with different sects fighting for their narrative to be to be more, you know, more widely accepted than the others.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:36.000
Yeah. And this scholar, I had to look up what was said.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:37.000
It was Jeremiah.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:47.000
So I asked him, I go, is there any instances of one of the prophets citing from Genesis or quoting and saying, as Moses says, he says, yes, Jeremiah 423.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
And I look, okay, look it up.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:53.000
Jeremiah 423 says, I looked at the earth and it was formless and empty.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:56.000
And the head and at the heavens, their light was gone.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:00.000
And I'm like, so where's the citation?

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
And then he was like, this is what he says.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:05.000
He says, it's clearly dependent on Genesis.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
And I was like, what do you mean clearly?

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:10.000
And he's like, are you being serious right now?

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:11.000
He got like mad at me.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:16.000
And I was like, I'm just asking, how do you, how do you just assume this is borrowing from Genesis?

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:19.000
And it's because that word formless is in there.

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:22.000
And I'm like, and I just don't think strong connection at all.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:23.000
I just think that's.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Well, I mean, again, even if the quote was verbatim verbatim.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:28.000
By the way, which it isn't.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:29.000
It is my notes.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:40.000
So it's not, but I'm saying, even if to give your benefit of a doubt to your friend, even if this was verbatim, it's very easy for a redactor in the Hellenistic period to add this.

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:44.000
This quote into the text of Jeremiah.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:47.000
You know what I'm saying?

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:52.000
It's not, it's, it means nothing because you add, we see that these texts were constantly.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:16:01.000
I mean, the form, you know, the Jeremiah between the, the, the Septuagint version of Jeremiah and the Masoretic text of Jeremiah are very, very different.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:03.000
Very different.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:11.000
Also, the length is very deep, not just the, I mean, the, the, the location of the chapters is very different and the length of the text is different.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:19.000
But also if you compare that to the Qumran version that we found in command of Jeremiah, it is even different than these two.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Okay.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Jeremiah was still being the text of Jeremiah was still being worked on in the second century, first century BCE.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:29.000
Okay.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:39.000
And they changed, they moved around versus they moved around a, a a, a, a, a corricapies, they moved around chapters, they moved the, the, you know, the added stuff.

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
They, you know, they removed stuff.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:49.000
They were, it was still undergoing in the second century BC in the first century BC, still undergoing edition, action, et cetera.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:50.360
with action, et cetera.

02:16:50.360 --> 02:16:55.360
So very easy, if I wanted to make people believe

02:16:56.320 --> 02:16:58.560
that Genesis was a very ancient text

02:16:58.560 --> 02:17:03.000
or a very fundamental text to the people,

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:06.400
very easy to add quotes into the text of Jeremiah

02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:09.040
or into the text of Hosea or Joel or whatever.

02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:12.720
And you can do it in Amos.

02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:15.800
You can add something that seems to be

02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:20.160
and to be a citation from Genesis or Exodus.

02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:21.400
And then people would say, well, look,

02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:23.400
Amos knew about this.

02:17:23.400 --> 02:17:25.240
Now, first of all, if you're approaching this

02:17:25.240 --> 02:17:26.840
from a scientific perspective,

02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:29.800
saying that there was a person like Amos,

02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:32.520
it's not scientific, okay?

02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:33.360
There might have been.

02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:36.560
I don't really know, but I can't assert that there was.

02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:42.680
I, in my article on Amos and I normally don't,

02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:46.720
most of my articles are not on real kind of biblical issues

02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:51.240
like that, but in this particular article on Amos,

02:17:53.720 --> 02:17:56.520
I refer to the Amosian school.

02:17:56.520 --> 02:17:59.760
I'm not talking about a specific person.

02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:03.360
And I, again, try to be, when I say scientific,

02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:05.520
I mean, I do not take,

02:18:06.040 --> 02:18:11.040
I need to have evidence before making a claim.

02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:16.160
I can't just say, okay, well, the Bible says so,

02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:17.900
therefore it's historical.

02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:20.180
And you know what?

02:18:20.180 --> 02:18:23.400
The Bible never claims to be in the book of history.

02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:28.400
I mean, the concept was not even developed yet.

02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:31.640
So that was not one of its concerns.

02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:34.720
It was involved in an ideological battle

02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:38.400
between sects on the, I mean, again,

02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:40.920
just like the Annihads in Rome are not,

02:18:40.920 --> 02:18:43.960
they don't claim to be actualist history.

02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:46.160
Everyone knew that this is a form of mythology,

02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:48.080
but they accepted mythology.

02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:50.280
They had no problem with mythology.

02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:52.920
Mythology was a form of history.

02:18:52.920 --> 02:18:54.900
They, I mean, they, you know,

02:18:54.900 --> 02:18:57.040
and so it's not like today

02:18:57.040 --> 02:19:01.800
when we equate mythology with lie, it's not lie, okay?

02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:03.100
It is a tradition.

02:19:04.100 --> 02:19:05.900
You know, your mythology is your tradition.

02:19:05.900 --> 02:19:08.700
It is the stories that your ancestors told.

02:19:08.700 --> 02:19:09.620
It's not a lie.

02:19:09.620 --> 02:19:11.300
It is a tradition.

02:19:11.300 --> 02:19:14.500
It is something that's part of your ethnic heritage, right?

02:19:14.500 --> 02:19:18.060
Your ethnic DNA or your kind of cultural DNA.

02:19:19.100 --> 02:19:24.100
And mythology was viewed with high regard.

02:19:24.140 --> 02:19:26.980
Today we see mythology as something that is a lie

02:19:26.980 --> 02:19:30.020
or almost, you know, people telling you something

02:19:30.020 --> 02:19:32.660
in order to, almost a marketing ploy.

02:19:32.660 --> 02:19:37.140
But that simply was not the case in the ancient world.

02:19:37.140 --> 02:19:41.060
Yeah, and it normally represents some truths within it.

02:19:41.060 --> 02:19:43.300
There is a grain of truth in every mythology, right?

02:19:43.300 --> 02:19:44.620
Absolutely.

02:19:44.620 --> 02:19:46.240
Yeah, not to, you know,

02:19:46.240 --> 02:19:47.300
I just thought that was interesting

02:19:47.300 --> 02:19:51.060
how when I asked that question, it was like there was,

02:19:51.060 --> 02:19:53.460
it was like, I was being rude to them

02:19:53.460 --> 02:19:56.540
for even questioning that Genesis could be,

02:19:56.540 --> 02:19:58.980
it was very strange the way it went down, but.

02:19:58.980 --> 02:20:02.340
People are very emotional about this, of course.

02:20:02.340 --> 02:20:05.380
And I see it all the time, of course,

02:20:05.380 --> 02:20:06.740
and I get accused of, you know,

02:20:06.740 --> 02:20:08.380
all kinds of accusations because of this.

02:20:08.380 --> 02:20:12.580
But, you know, I am committed and I work on this

02:20:12.580 --> 02:20:14.500
very closely with my students

02:20:14.500 --> 02:20:16.780
to being committed to the science,

02:20:16.780 --> 02:20:21.320
the scientific method of historical research.

02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:24.700
And I do not, again, for example,

02:20:24.700 --> 02:20:28.580
showing that there was a unified linguistic identity

02:20:28.580 --> 02:20:31.540
already in the sixth century, late seventh,

02:20:31.540 --> 02:20:34.440
as I said earlier today in our discussion.

02:20:35.740 --> 02:20:38.140
Some people see that as being conservative, right?

02:20:38.140 --> 02:20:41.100
To see, well, there was already a unified,

02:20:41.100 --> 02:20:42.820
kind of quote, unquote, Jewish identity

02:20:42.820 --> 02:20:44.960
already that early on.

02:20:45.980 --> 02:20:47.940
Some people see that as a conservative

02:20:47.940 --> 02:20:50.020
because it's in scholarship,

02:20:50.020 --> 02:20:55.020
it's, you usually talk, you see Jews as Judean

02:20:56.020 --> 02:20:58.460
rather than Celtic.

02:20:58.740 --> 02:21:02.580
There was, I mean, the common opinion in scholarship

02:21:02.580 --> 02:21:06.420
is that there was no Celtic unity among Yahwists

02:21:06.420 --> 02:21:10.740
until when they started to be identified as Jews,

02:21:10.740 --> 02:21:12.700
which is only in the Asmonean period.

02:21:14.460 --> 02:21:19.460
And so usually, what's normal in scholarship is to say,

02:21:20.700 --> 02:21:23.940
to use the word Jews only from the second century BC.

02:21:23.940 --> 02:21:26.980
And here I say, well, I still don't use the word Jews,

02:21:27.420 --> 02:21:30.540
but I'm saying there was a common Yahwistic identity

02:21:30.540 --> 02:21:34.340
that goes way beyond the borders of Judea

02:21:34.340 --> 02:21:39.100
already in the seventh and into the sixth century BC

02:21:39.100 --> 02:21:43.540
and was very clear from the quote, unquote, exile on.

02:21:45.180 --> 02:21:48.340
And that's another thing you start seeing synagogues

02:21:48.340 --> 02:21:50.900
in the Hellenistic era, not before that, though.

02:21:50.900 --> 02:21:52.700
That's right, that's right.

02:21:52.700 --> 02:21:55.460
And so in Jonathan, my friend Jonathan Adler,

02:21:55.460 --> 02:21:57.940
who's an excellent scholar,

02:21:57.940 --> 02:21:59.740
none of you have had him already on your show

02:21:59.740 --> 02:22:02.260
or if not, you should, but his book,

02:22:02.260 --> 02:22:07.260
The Origins of Judaism is just a great work

02:22:09.180 --> 02:22:11.660
that describes this very, very clearly

02:22:11.660 --> 02:22:14.860
from the archeological, starting from the archeologist

02:22:14.860 --> 02:22:19.860
to from the archeological data on how that developed.

02:22:20.860 --> 02:22:25.860
But yeah, history, actual reality is much more interesting

02:22:26.820 --> 02:22:30.420
than the stories that they told you about the Bible.

02:22:30.420 --> 02:22:31.420
And again, not-

02:22:31.420 --> 02:22:33.980
It makes me like the Bible more, it does.

02:22:33.980 --> 02:22:35.660
Exactly, I mean, exactly.

02:22:35.660 --> 02:22:39.460
Look, I mean, there are a lot of scriptures out there

02:22:39.460 --> 02:22:43.220
like the Avesta, the Rig Veda, and the Vedas in general,

02:22:44.100 --> 02:22:46.900
that are rich, beautiful works.

02:22:47.260 --> 02:22:49.940
They also have, they also interact

02:22:49.940 --> 02:22:52.180
with historical events.

02:22:52.180 --> 02:22:55.300
They have beautiful hymns, beautiful, beautiful,

02:22:55.300 --> 02:22:57.620
beautiful work, not less than the Bible.

02:22:57.620 --> 02:23:02.380
The difference with the Bible is simply its geography,

02:23:02.380 --> 02:23:04.580
where all of these came together

02:23:04.580 --> 02:23:07.580
and left their imprint in some way, shape, or form

02:23:07.580 --> 02:23:10.260
in this region, just because of where it's located.

02:23:10.260 --> 02:23:12.340
You had to cross, if you want to go from Egypt

02:23:12.340 --> 02:23:16.300
to the, to Mesopotamia, you had to cross this area

02:23:16.300 --> 02:23:18.860
or if you wanted to go from Mesopotamia to Egypt

02:23:18.860 --> 02:23:23.100
or from Europe to Egypt, as Alexander did, for example,

02:23:23.100 --> 02:23:26.460
you had to go through this region and leave an imprint.

02:23:26.460 --> 02:23:29.540
And that's what gives the Bible its unique flavor.

02:23:29.540 --> 02:23:32.100
But there are a lot of beautiful, you know,

02:23:32.100 --> 02:23:34.980
scriptural works other than the Bible that exists there.

02:23:34.980 --> 02:23:39.860
I don't think they are less beautiful and less authoritative.

02:23:41.060 --> 02:23:44.100
And, but certainly the Bible is up there,

02:23:44.860 --> 02:23:49.860
and its uniqueness is just how eclectic it is, right?

02:23:51.260 --> 02:23:54.580
Conserving elements from all of these empires,

02:23:54.580 --> 02:23:56.500
from the Assyrian Empire, the Babylonian Empire,

02:23:56.500 --> 02:24:00.220
the Persian Empire, the Hellenistic Empire's plural

02:24:00.220 --> 02:24:03.620
into the Roman, and all of this,

02:24:03.620 --> 02:24:07.580
all of these left a mark that is conserved,

02:24:07.580 --> 02:24:10.220
and you can still hear these echoes in the Bible today.

02:24:10.220 --> 02:24:14.060
And that's what I think makes it really unique and powerful.

02:24:14.100 --> 02:24:16.420
Simply its humanity.

02:24:16.420 --> 02:24:17.420
Well said.

02:24:17.420 --> 02:24:19.900
I mean, we cover a lot of ground in this discussion,

02:24:19.900 --> 02:24:24.380
and I just want to, I don't know if that was perfectly well said,

02:24:24.380 --> 02:24:28.020
we can end on that, and I just want to give you the time to,

02:24:28.020 --> 02:24:29.820
you know, talk about anything that's coming up

02:24:29.820 --> 02:24:31.180
that you want to promote.

02:24:31.180 --> 02:24:32.700
Obviously, you got the book coming out,

02:24:32.700 --> 02:24:34.300
anything else besides that?

02:24:35.300 --> 02:24:36.500
Well, I have this book coming out.

02:24:36.500 --> 02:24:39.660
I have a number of books as well,

02:24:39.660 --> 02:24:42.860
kind of on that I'm finishing now, I mean, finishing it.

02:24:42.860 --> 02:24:44.660
I'm writing, I was commissioned to write a book

02:24:44.660 --> 02:24:47.300
about Elephantine, the history of the Elephantine,

02:24:47.300 --> 02:24:50.140
yeah, with the community there, so they asked me to write that,

02:24:50.140 --> 02:24:53.740
and that's, I'm already working on that, of course.

02:24:53.740 --> 02:24:55.980
That's good, that's a big project, of course,

02:24:55.980 --> 02:25:01.460
to actually write the history of this absolutely amazing community.

02:25:01.460 --> 02:25:04.420
The good thing is, of course, I have several articles on this

02:25:04.420 --> 02:25:11.180
that I can use in this work on this book,

02:25:11.180 --> 02:25:15.740
and I have, yeah, I have these other books that I mentioned

02:25:15.740 --> 02:25:19.340
throughout our talk today also about the Alexandria,

02:25:19.340 --> 02:25:22.660
the museum on Alexandria, and its impact on biblical,

02:25:22.660 --> 02:25:26.780
on the biblical evolution of the biblical text,

02:25:26.780 --> 02:25:28.660
and on the composition of the biblical text,

02:25:28.660 --> 02:25:34.260
putting them together, and yeah, but really, I think what's,

02:25:34.260 --> 02:25:38.900
I'm extremely excited about this book that is coming out,

02:25:38.940 --> 02:25:41.540
Yahwism under the Achaemenid Empire,

02:25:41.540 --> 02:25:43.260
because, of course, it's not just me,

02:25:43.260 --> 02:25:48.500
it's colleagues that are fantastic, that have contributed to this,

02:25:48.500 --> 02:25:53.580
that were in our, in the conference in 2022,

02:25:53.580 --> 02:25:57.700
really the great scholars, just so if you read that book,

02:25:57.700 --> 02:26:02.020
you have, you get, and by the way, not all of them agree with me,

02:26:02.020 --> 02:26:07.540
even within the book, and so you can get a,

02:26:08.540 --> 02:26:12.860
a glimpse into the discussions, some of them, you know,

02:26:12.860 --> 02:26:15.860
disagree with one another, but that's exactly what you wanted to have.

02:26:15.860 --> 02:26:20.420
We wanted to have all of the different points of view,

02:26:20.420 --> 02:26:23.860
or, in case, you know, major points of view,

02:26:23.860 --> 02:26:26.500
discussing different things together, and really get,

02:26:26.500 --> 02:26:30.700
so when you read the different chapters or different contributions,

02:26:30.700 --> 02:26:35.900
in that book, you get a very, very good picture of Yahwism

02:26:35.900 --> 02:26:39.260
at that, under the Achaemenid Empire,

02:26:39.260 --> 02:26:41.260
and of course, you can agree or disagree with me,

02:26:41.260 --> 02:26:46.500
or with my colleagues, or with other, other people there, on there,

02:26:46.500 --> 02:26:50.740
but at least all of us try to make our,

02:26:50.740 --> 02:26:56.740
the most scientific arguments we can to, to support our, our arguments,

02:26:56.740 --> 02:26:57.340
support our positions.

02:26:57.340 --> 02:26:58.980
Yeah, I can't wait to see, do you think,

02:26:58.980 --> 02:27:02.260
and you think this book is going to bring some,

02:27:02.260 --> 02:27:05.220
some game changers out, like some stuff that no one's ever,

02:27:05.220 --> 02:27:07.580
like this is going to shake things up a little bit, right?

02:27:07.580 --> 02:27:08.420
Yeah, absolutely.

02:27:08.420 --> 02:27:10.980
There are a number of articles there that are going to be,

02:27:10.980 --> 02:27:15.340
to shape, really shake things up, and, and, and open up.

02:27:15.340 --> 02:27:18.700
I think this book is going to be a reference book for decades,

02:27:18.700 --> 02:27:22.700
you know, into the future, that all scholars in our field will,

02:27:22.700 --> 02:27:26.420
will have to have on their, on their, under desk.

02:27:26.420 --> 02:27:27.260
Yes.

02:27:27.260 --> 02:27:28.580
I agree.

02:27:28.580 --> 02:27:32.580
This is going to be a reference book for, for, for decades to come.

02:27:32.580 --> 02:27:33.860
Is there a way to pre-order it?

02:27:33.860 --> 02:27:35.820
Can people pre-order it now or no?

02:27:35.820 --> 02:27:36.740
I think, I think so.

02:27:36.740 --> 02:27:42.220
There's already, there's already a, a, a, it's already on the decorator website.

02:27:42.220 --> 02:27:42.820
Oh, okay.

02:27:42.820 --> 02:27:45.020
So I'll put the link in the description right now.

02:27:45.020 --> 02:27:47.740
So people watching this now, pre-order that thing.

02:27:47.740 --> 02:27:49.660
This is going to be the book that it's going to change

02:27:49.660 --> 02:27:52.420
with biblical scholarship as we know it.

02:27:52.420 --> 02:27:55.500
Yeah, and I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm promoting it as much as I can.

02:27:55.500 --> 02:27:57.420
I think it's, I just promote and promote good stuff.

02:27:57.420 --> 02:28:01.900
So definitely I'll put the link in the description, check that out.

02:28:01.900 --> 02:28:05.380
And you have just attained true gnosis.
