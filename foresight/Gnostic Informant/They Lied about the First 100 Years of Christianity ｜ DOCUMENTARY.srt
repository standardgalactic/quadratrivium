1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,640
The

2
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,080
first century of Christianity is shrouded in mystery. What we know for sure, compared

3
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:37,120
to what we are told by traditional accounts, is wide-ranging and extremely problematic.

4
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,680
The earliest Christian documents we have are letters from Paul dating from the 40s and

5
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:49,360
50s and early 60s. Only seven of them are considered to be authentic and written by

6
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,120
one author, although it is entirely possible that others are written by someone Paul was

7
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:02,520
close to or even his secretary. These letters from Paul contain the most important details

8
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:10,240
about Jesus being crucified. We have letters from John and Peter, which may not be authentic,

9
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,640
but are nevertheless late 1st century, early 2nd century texts written by Christians,

10
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:24,320
and there is also an epistle from Jude, James, and an unknown author writing to an

11
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:33,320
assembly of Greek-speaking Hebrews. Outside of these letters, the only surviving 1st century

12
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:40,400
letter, which was not included in the biblical canon, is the epistle of Clement dated to 96 AD,

13
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,520
which we will discuss. The book of Revelation is also dated to this year and is considered to

14
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,960
be in close proximity to the Joe Hennine collection and possibly the same author who wrote John's

15
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,480
letters. Most scholars date to three synoptic Gospels for the late 1st, early 2nd century,

16
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:08,720
starting with Mark around 70, then Matthew between 85 and 95, and Luke Acts in the early to the

17
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:16,000
middle 2nd century. The Gospel of John is also dated by most scholars to be between the 90s

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,120
and 140s. All four of these Gospels did not have the names of authors attached to them until the

19
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,080
end of the 2nd century, so we don't even know if they really were written by Mark, Matthew, Luke,

20
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:37,080
or John. These titles were given by later Church Fathers. The earliest physical fragments of these

21
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:44,680
texts that we have are from the late 2nd and 3rd century, and the oldest full copy of the Bible

22
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:53,520
in existence is the Codex Sinaiticus from 325 AD. The Gospel of Thomas, which was once an important

23
00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:01,000
early Christian text, is dated between the 1st and early 2nd century, some even arguing that it

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,240
could be the oldest, but was not selected among the biblical canon by the Church Fathers in the

25
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:14,080
4th century. Although its impact on early Christianity was massive, outside of that there

26
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:21,000
is a plethora of Gospels and texts produced by the early Christians in the 2nd century that will

27
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,800
be discussed later in the video. Please hit that like button and subscribe. Before we start,

28
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:37,280
I have some great news for everyone today. This video is sponsored by Atlas VPN. Now back to the video.

29
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:53,360
In the 4th century, Eusebius provides a detailed list of the early Church bishops in Antioch,

30
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:04,080
Rome, Alexandria, Athens, Corinth, Smyrna, and others. These lists show a direct continuation from

31
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,480
the apostles like Andrew, consecrating the father of the heretic Marcian, Philologus,

32
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,680
the 1st Bishop of Synope, as well as Andrew, consecrating the 1st Bishop of Corinth, named

33
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,000
Apollos, who is mentioned in Paul's letters. In Mark, being the 1st Bishop of Alexandria,

34
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,800
consecrated by Peter, with Peter being the 1st Bishop of both Antioch and Rome,

35
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:39,280
consecrating both Linus and Ivarius. And of course, they list James as the leader and 1st Bishop

36
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:46,320
of the Church of Jerusalem. And from them are the 70 apostles listed in Acts and names that look

37
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,960
familiar to people mentioned in Paul's letters. These elaborate lists of succession show what

38
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:00,800
appears to be a united Church that has a direct line of orthodoxy from Jesus down to Constantine.

39
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,280
However, the primary sources show this not only to be problematic,

40
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,880
but impossible in some cases. Many of the sources have conflicting lists with each other. People

41
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,160
considered to be alive in certain times are somehow alive in times when they should be dead.

42
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,560
And the surviving texts that we do have are so few and far between that it becomes a nightmare

43
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,960
to try to piece it all together. The truth is, early Christianity was far from united.

44
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,880
It was so diverse that I would argue Christians in the first two centuries were farther apart

45
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,560
than a Mormon is today with a Catholic.

46
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:55,280
On one side of the spectrum, you have Ebonites, Jewish law observing Christians,

47
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:02,960
who revere James the Just, but reject Paul as a liar. They follow strict dietary laws from the Torah,

48
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,920
keep the Sabbath and the commandments, and think Jesus is the Messiah, but not God.

49
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:19,040
You also have Elkicites from Parthia, who are also Torah observant, but also think that Jesus

50
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:27,280
was a giant 96-mile tall and 14-mile wide angel who was the Son of God, and his sister,

51
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,560
the Holy Spirit, was also the same size. And no, I'm not making this up.

52
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,720
On the other side of the spectrum, you have quite the opposite, Canites, who think the

53
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:45,040
Old Testament God is actually the devil, and Judas was the hero, and all the way to pagan

54
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:51,680
Christians like the Perate, who believed that Greek gods such as Zeus and Aphrodite

55
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,680
were actually the Archons who created the world, and Christ came to save the world from them.

56
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,960
There are many sects and denominations in between, such as the School of Callistus,

57
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:12,320
who gave way to the Noetians, people who were called Heretics at first for saying Jesus

58
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Christ and God the Father were actually the same being, as well as Dositists who think Christ was

59
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,200
so divine that he could not have a flesh body and that he was just a phantom that just appeared to be

60
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:35,360
human. Dositists were the first main heresy of Christianity on record. And then there are some

61
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,320
sects that are so radical that you don't even know where to put them on the spectrum. The

62
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:46,560
Borba Rites, who are rumored to be one and the same as the Nicolations mentioned in Revelation,

63
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:54,080
are a group of Eastern Roman Christians of Syria and Egypt, who apparently put seamen and menstrual

64
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:01,200
fluids in their Eucharist, and engaged in orgiastic baptismal rites, took psychedelics,

65
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,600
spoke in tongues. Those guys definitely had the Holy Spirit.

66
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:18,400
There is no such thing as proto-Orthodox. This is a term used in hindsight of what ideas won the

67
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,960
battle for what would fit best for the Roman Church in the 4th century. Who we are told are the

68
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:32,080
heretics and who we are told are orthodoxy is not so clear when we examine the sources

69
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,880
and compare them to the central teachings of Jesus and even Paul too. I will be demonstrating this

70
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,400
in this video.

71
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:56,160
As most people know, Jesus lived in the first half of the first century, had a following of young

72
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:04,080
Jewish teens consisting of both male and female, and he was crucified under Pontus Pilate in Jerusalem

73
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:11,600
around 30 AD. Most of his life is shrouded in mystery. He wrote nothing down, and we have

74
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:18,560
zero contemporary primary sources or any archaeological evidence about him or his movement

75
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:25,280
that exists from the period in which he was alive. Everything we know about him is taken from Paul's

76
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:31,280
letters and what the Gospel authors say about him. All we know about his family is that his mother's

77
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:37,600
name was Mary and that James may or may not have been his brother. Paul tells us nothing about his

78
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:45,920
father and the earliest Gospel Mark doesn't even mention who his father's name is. It is not until

79
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:53,600
Matthew's Gospel written between 85 and 95 in which we get any mention of Joseph being the

80
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:02,240
father of Jesus. Kelsus, a Greek who was hostile to Christianity, claims that Jesus' biological

81
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:10,080
father was a Roman soldier named Pantera. Kelsus cites Jewish sources who he says he got this

82
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:16,400
information from, and the Talmudic fragments from rabbinic sources also agree with this.

83
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:24,320
According to Origen, Kelsus lived during the reign of Hadrian between 117 and 138.

84
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:31,920
Even if Kelsus wrote later, this would mean that Pantera and Joseph, as possible fathers of Jesus,

85
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:38,880
are nearly contemporary ideas to each other in the sources. If Joseph was really Jesus'

86
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,880
father's name, you would think Paul's letters in Mark's early Gospel would easily relate this.

87
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,320
And what reason would Jews have for deceptively telling Kelsus in the early second century

88
00:10:52,320 --> 00:11:00,320
that his father was actually Pantera, a Gentile Roman born out of wedlock? It seems that there

89
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:07,280
would be much more incentive for Paul to hide this than there would be for Kelsus to lie about this.

90
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:14,400
Whether Joseph or Pantera is his father is impossible to know. I will leave that up to you

91
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:20,080
to decide. This is a topic for another video. The main question I want to explore in this video

92
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,560
is what did the earliest Christians believe and who were they?

93
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:36,560
Kelsus gives us a list of the sex and denominations of the church that were relevant in his day

94
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,600
in the early second century. He says,

95
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,120
Those of the great church receive as true the accounts of the creation in six days

96
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:55,360
and God resting on the seventh. They agree in regard to this first man and deduce their genealogies

97
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,360
from him. They accept the narratives about going of the children of Israel into Egypt

98
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,520
and their flight from it. I know some hold the Creator, the God of the Jews, to be different from

99
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:15,040
and opposed to the God which Jesus came from. In truth, their divisions are endless. They have

100
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:22,400
carnal and spiritual men. They call themselves Christians who wish to live in all things as the

101
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:32,160
Jews. There are among them, Sybalist, Simonians, Marcellians, Carpocrations, disciples of Mary

102
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:40,400
and Martha and Marcionites. But not withstanding all their divisions and abusive controversies,

103
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,840
you may hear them all saying the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world.

104
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:53,200
What I find so interesting about this passage is how he shows no knowledge of any Gnostic heresy

105
00:12:53,200 --> 00:13:00,160
at this time. Although he does show knowledge of divisions, which is understandable, he considers

106
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:07,040
the Simonians, Marcellians, Carpocrations and Marcionites to be among the sects of the great

107
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:14,000
church. All of them are considered Gnostics and Heretics by later Christian writers.

108
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,760
You would think Kelsus would have said something about this if he knew this was the case,

109
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:26,960
and he mentions them as being Sybalist. I think this is very telling of how the early church was

110
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:33,200
divided, but yet all were within the church, wide-ranging doctrines that oppose each other,

111
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,960
yet all believed in the crucifixion. I will address every single sect listed by Kelsus,

112
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:45,760
plus others, and I think there is a good reason why Kelsus lists the Sybalist first.

113
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:57,760
The Sybillian oracles, texts written in Greek hexameter prose, are a wide-ranging phenomena

114
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:04,080
that is said to stretch back to the oracle of Delphi and spread throughout the Hellenistic world

115
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:14,240
into Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, Judea, North Africa and Italy. The Sybil was at first depicted as an

116
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:21,680
aged woman with the gift of prophecy, and that there were 12 of them. The Persian Sybil, the Libyan

117
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:31,600
Sybil, Delphic Sybil, Camarian, Erythrian, Sammian, Kumayan, Hellespontine, Phrygian, Turbotine,

118
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:39,680
Egyptian and Chaldean Sybil. Some lists replaced the Persian Sybil with the Hebrew Sybil.

119
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:47,440
Legend had it that the Kumayan Sybil, close to Rome, was a thousand years old and had given her

120
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:56,000
books to the fifth king of Rome in a Truscan king named Tarquinius Priscus, grandson of Numa

121
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,960
Populus, who succeeded Romulus. These oracles were entrusted to the priesthood of Jupiter

122
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:08,320
to be guarded by the Vestal Virgins and only consulted in times of crisis.

123
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,960
Regardless of the truth of their origins, these books became central to the religion of Rome

124
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:21,360
during the Republic era. Like the prophets of the Old Testament, these Sybils predicted future

125
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:29,760
catastrophic events and the demise of major cities by God. These texts were most likely used as a

126
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:37,920
form of political propaganda to sway public opinion during times of war. From the 3rd century BC

127
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:44,400
to the 1st century, we see a mixture of Greek and Jewish themes present in these texts.

128
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:51,200
Specifically in Alexandria, Egypt, where a large Jewish and Greek population coexist.

129
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:57,920
It is here in Alexandria where the collection of all 12 Sybils are gathered and put into one

130
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:04,960
collection. They show both Jewish and pagan influence, everything from Hesiod themes of the

131
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:12,400
golden age of Saturn, Homeric epics like the Iliad, predictions of Romulus, Cyrus the Great,

132
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:20,800
Alexander the Great, Caesar Augustus, as well as references to gods like Aries, Cronos, Aphrodite,

133
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:27,200
Zeus, and the Titans vs the Olympians. All the way to stories about Noah's Ark,

134
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:34,400
the Tower of Bevel, Moses getting the tablets on Mount Sinai, the Latin poet Virgil is mentioned

135
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:42,160
by name in the Sybillian oracles as a great teacher, sent by God to teach the world. And Virgil

136
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:49,600
himself cites the Sybillian books in his Aeneid and mentions Dephobi as the Kumayan Sybil.

137
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,680
To show some passages of the 3rd Sybilian oracle to give you an idea of what it's like.

138
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:40,960
The first one formed and filling with his name Anatoly, Hesperides, Notos, and Boreus.

139
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:48,800
The same as he who fixed the pattern of the human form and made wild beast and creeping things and

140
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:56,240
fowls. Sybilian oracles 3. Notice the blend between pagan and Jewish elements and how the

141
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:03,120
curator includes the many gods within his creation of the world. This type of genre

142
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,440
can also be seen along the book of Revelation, for example.

143
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:39,520
Thassala gave up the dead that were in it and Thanatos and Hades gave up the dead that were in

144
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:47,440
them and each person was judged according to what they had done. Then Thanatos and Hades were thrown

145
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:54,400
into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death. Anyone whose name was not found

146
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,000
written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire. Revelation. If you read the

147
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,480
English translation, you might not know this, but most English translations are like playing a game

148
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,560
of telephone. Being filtered through Latin and different versions of English, the nouns are

149
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:20,720
translated into places when they are written as names. Not only that, Gaia, Aranos, Thassala,

150
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:28,400
Thanatos, and Hades are all gods that have hymns dedicated to them in the Orphic hymns.

151
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:35,200
The latter three, Thassala, Thanatos, and Hades are gods who rule over the dead, while Gaia and

152
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:42,240
Aranos rule over creation. Their functions in this book Revelation, Chapter 20, are exactly this.

153
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:50,720
Seeing Gaia and Aranos fleeing from God and Thanatos, Hades, and Thassala giving up their dead, here

154
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:57,440
Thanatos and Hades are being judged and casted into the lake of fire for being insubordinate to the

155
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:04,960
divine plan of God. Revelation was the last book to be accepted into the Christian biblical canon,

156
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:11,600
and even at present day, some Nestorian churches reject it. It was tainted because the heretical

157
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:18,800
sect of the Montanist relied on it, and doubts were raised over its Jewishness and authorship,

158
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:26,800
and it was not until 419 that it was included into the canon. The Montanists were led by

159
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:35,440
Montanus, a heretic who was also called Anostic, and he was a Sybilist. He was assisted by two women,

160
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,840
Prisca and Maximilla, who led a Christian Sybilist group called the Illuminati, enlightened ones.

161
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,160
Yeah, Illuminati, and these women were considered prophetesses and the voices of the Sybil.

162
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:56,960
They entered into states of ecstatic frenzies, spoke in tongues, and prophesied the future.

163
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:04,240
Montanus, despite being deemed a heretic, is credited with baptizing Trotellian,

164
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,440
who was also known as the father of Latin Christianity. Already we're starting to see that

165
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,800
the lines between heretics and orthodoxy are getting blurred, and if you think that's a lot,

166
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,360
just keep watching. The Sybil continues.

167
00:21:44,880 --> 00:22:14,400
Here we see another theme that both the Sybil and the

168
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:20,720
Revelation have in common, prophecy of the birth of Christ under the reign of Augustus,

169
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,400
and the coming of the Antichrist, who is Nero. Here's how it is told in Revelation.

170
00:22:44,480 --> 00:23:14,320
Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the

171
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:24,080
beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 660 and 6, Revelation.

172
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:31,760
We know that the beast is Nero, because the Latin version gives the Dramatria of 616. The only name

173
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:40,160
in both Greek and Latin that have a Dramatria of 666 and 616, who also fits this role, is Nero.

174
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:46,320
The Antichrist, who caused the Seven-Year War between Rome and Judea to break out,

175
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,360
that results in the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem. The Sybil continues.

176
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,880
And then the generation tenth appeared of mortal men, from the time when the flood

177
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:04,320
came upon earlier men, and Kronos reigned, and Titan, and Iapetus, and men called them best,

178
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:11,760
offspring of Gaia and of Uranus, giving them names both of earth and heaven,

179
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,520
since they were very first of mortal men. So there were three divisions of the earth,

180
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:23,200
according to the allotment of each man, and each one having his own portion reigned,

181
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:30,560
and fought not, for father's oath were there, and equal were their portions. But the time,

182
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:36,640
complete of old age, on the father came, and he died. And the sons, infringing oaths,

183
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:42,480
stirred up against each other bitter strife, which one should have the royal rank and rule over all

184
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:49,920
mortals. And against each other, Kronos and Titan fought, but Rhea and Gaia, and Aphrodite,

185
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:56,160
fond of crowns, Demeter and Hestia and Dione, of fair locks, brought them to friendship,

186
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:02,320
and together called, all who were kings, both brothers and near kin, and others of the same

187
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:09,680
ancestral blood. But when the Titans heard that there were sons kept secretly, whom Kronos and

188
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:17,200
his wife Rhea begat, then Titans sixty youths, and this is the beginning of dire war, the Egyptian

189
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:24,880
kingdom, then that of the Persians, and of the Medes, and Ethiopians, and of Assyria and Babylon,

190
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,520
and then that of the Macedonians, Egyptian yet again, then that of Rome, God imparted first,

191
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:39,760
Thou many kingdoms have been together, gathered of mankind. For first of all, the house of Solomon

192
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:46,880
shall include horsemen of Phoenicia and Syria, and of the islands too, sibling oracles three.

193
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,600
Once again we see themes from Hessead of the Golden Age, and the war breaking out in heaven,

194
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,800
between Titans and Olympians, but it quickly evolves into themes found in Daniel, with the

195
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:05,200
succession of kingdoms of the Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans. Finally, we are told about

196
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:12,960
the house of Solomon as God's kingdom on earth. The Sibyl ends with this. These things I show thee,

197
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:20,800
the long walls of Assyrian Babylon, for Greece to proclaim to all the wrath of God fire sent,

198
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:28,800
and that I might to mortals prophesy of mysteries divine, and men shall say in Greece

199
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:37,520
that I am a foreign land of Ethre, born shameless. Others say that I am a Sibyl, born of Mother

200
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:45,360
Cersei and Father Nostos, sibling oracles three. Cersei is the sister of Medea, and the daughter

201
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:52,960
of Hecate, goddess of magic, who is in Homer's Odyssey and other Greek and Roman myths, and she

202
00:26:52,960 --> 00:27:00,240
says her father is Nostos, an obvious Gnostic reference to the father of knowing. This is just

203
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:09,040
one tiny section of hundreds of pages and dozens of oracles written by pagans, Jews, and Christians,

204
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:16,880
living in Alexandria from 300 BC all the way until the 15th century, when they are strictly

205
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:23,280
written by only Orthodox Christians. They end up being used as political propaganda by the

206
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:30,400
Byzantines against the Muslims when they repurposed the Antichrist to be Muhammad. But the origins

207
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:36,720
of these very Orthodox Christian sibling oracles go back before Christianity even existed. During

208
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:44,400
a time when the Orphics, Platonists, Pythagoreans, and Jews clashed in Alexandria, especially during

209
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:50,880
the 2nd century BCE, it is during this time in Alexandria where Daniel and Enoch are written.

210
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:58,320
Texts that show close proximity to the Sibylian tradition about dreamlike oracles of future

211
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:05,920
events and messianic promises, Orpheus was credited by both Jews and Greeks in Alexandria

212
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:13,120
as being a great theologian who fathered Moses and was a son of the Sibyl. They also claim that

213
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:20,880
Noah's daughter was the Erythrian Sibyl called Thea Sibyl, the goddess Sibyl, and Heraclitus

214
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:29,280
in the 6th century BC said that her voice reaches through thousands of years. It is in this mixed

215
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:36,640
cultural environment of Alexandria where we get people like Aristobulus and Thilo and the soil

216
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:45,200
for Christianity to thrive in is laid down. It is not a mistake that Kelsus calls Christians Sibylist.

217
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:52,720
He is right on the money with this. These oracles which started off as Greek, then Roman, then Jewish,

218
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,560
and then towards the end of the 1st century and 2nd century were Christian and only written

219
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:06,000
by Christians. These Sibylian oracles are cited by Josephus, Justin Martyr, Clement,

220
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,480
and Origen and play a crucial role in the early church.

221
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:22,480
Not long before Kelsus wrote, we have the three earliest mentions of Christians by Roman authors.

222
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:29,520
The earliest mentioned by Roman writers and most detailed of the three would come from Pliny the

223
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:35,120
Younger in his letter to the Emperor Trajan in 112 AD. He says,

224
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,640
There have been some of this mad sect Christians whom I took notice of in particular as Roman

225
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:49,840
citizens that they might be sent to that city. After some time, as is usual in such examinations,

226
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:55,440
the crime spread itself and many more cases came before me. A libel was sent to me,

227
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,560
though without an author containing many names of persons accused. These denied that they were

228
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:08,800
Christians now or have ever been. They called upon the gods and supplicated to your image,

229
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:14,560
which I caused to be brought to me for that purpose with frankincense and wine. They also

230
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:20,800
cursed Christ, none of which things it is said can any of those that are ready Christians be

231
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:28,160
compelled to do. So I thought fit to let them go. Others of them that were named in the libel

232
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:34,800
said they were Christians, but presently denied it again, that indeed they had been Christians,

233
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:41,440
but had ceased to be so some three years ago. However, they assured me that the main of their

234
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:48,560
fault or the mistake was this that they were to on a stated day meet together at dawn and

235
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:56,240
sing a hymn to Christ as to a God alternately and to oblige themselves by a sacrament or oath.

236
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,520
Here we are told that these Christians will easily lie and reject Christ in order to save

237
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,880
their lives. Ironically, this goes against every Christian apologist claim about the so-called

238
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,560
martyrs who had died for something they know is true. Yet these Christians, when pressed,

239
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:18,240
will worship the image of Emperor Trajan and curse Christ in order to save their lives.

240
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,720
I do find one particular part of this useful for examining Christian practice. The passage about

241
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:31,280
them waking up at dawn and singing hymns to Christ is a rite commonly found among Orphics,

242
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:39,600
who also sing hymns to Lucifer or Iosphorus at morning at dawn and also oblige themselves to

243
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:52,560
oaths of piety. The next Roman source from this period comes from Tacitus. Nero fastened the guilt

244
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:57,920
and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations

245
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin,

246
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,520
suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators,

247
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:15,840
Pontius Pilate, and a most mischievous superstition. Thus, checked for the moment,

248
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:23,120
again broke out not only in Judea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all

249
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,640
things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their center and become popular.

250
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,600
A few years later, Suetonius would write something very similar. Punishment was inflicted on the

251
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:41,280
Christians, a class of men given to a new and mischievous superstition. From these two sources,

252
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,840
we can't really gather much about them, other than there seems to be a rumor that they were

253
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:52,480
blamed for the fire at Rome and that they held to strange superstitions. The only non-Christian

254
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:59,440
source in the first century that mentions Jesus is Josephus. But this text is considered by scholars

255
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:05,600
to be extremely problematic, to the point that it is considered to be either heavily edited or even

256
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:12,160
not authentic at all. Origin, who makes use of Josephus in his writings, never once mentions

257
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:18,560
the passage that talks about Jesus, which you would think he would. Even if there was a passage

258
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:25,200
about Jesus in Josephus, the text was so heavily edited that we can no longer tell what was actually

259
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:31,440
said. Josephus does, however, talk quite a lot about another biblical character, John the Baptist.

260
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,800
John the Baptist was considered a great prophet in his time and he was executed by Herod

261
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:50,000
sometime in the early first century. There are movements from Palestine known as Mandeism,

262
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,120
or Nazorianism, who venerate John as the Messiah, or greatest prophet that ever lived,

263
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,960
and they even place him above Jesus himself, who they consider to be somewhat of an imposter.

264
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:09,520
They do not consider Jesus to be the Son of God, let alone one with God. The name of the Mandeans

265
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,360
comes from the Aramaic Manda, meaning knowledge, which literally means these people were called

266
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:22,560
Gnostics in the Aramaic tongue. The core tenets of their religion shows heavy influences from

267
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:30,160
Zoroastrianism and the Syrian Magi. The central belief system of this particular religion goes by

268
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:38,240
the name Nasrta, which translates to Nessorian, which translates to Nessorian Gnosis, or a form

269
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:47,200
of a divine insight. Followers of this faith refer to themselves as Nasoriai, meaning Nazorians.

270
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:54,160
The community of Nazorians is split into two main groups, the Tarmiduta, which pertains to the clergy

271
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:02,800
and the Mandeuta, referring to general congregation. The term for the latter is derived from the word

272
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:11,680
Manda once again, meaning knowledge or Gnosis. Mandeans revered Adam, Abel, Seth, Enos, Noah,

273
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:19,520
Shem, Aram, and especially John the Baptist. And much like Zoroastrians, they worship one God,

274
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:26,880
who they call the King of Light, the ruler of heaven that oversees an army of angels in opposition

275
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,520
to a king of the underworld called Krun, who rules the demons.

276
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:42,400
They believe in baptism as a way of salvation from sins and initiation into heaven. The term

277
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:50,560
Baptist comes from the Greek baptize. Surprisingly, there are a group of ancient Greek Pythagoreans

278
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:57,760
and Orphics living in Corinth, ironically one of the main early Christian cities in which Paul writes

279
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:06,560
to. And in Corinth, these Orphics actually call themselves Baptists. A text from an author named

280
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:15,440
Eupolis, who lived in Athens between 446 and 411 BC, writes about these Baptists and claims that

281
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:23,440
Elkabiodes and Socrates were among the initiated and that they adopted foreign religious practices

282
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:30,960
from the Persians and Egyptians and engaged in nocturnal rites. It is entirely possible

283
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,800
that this group could have looked a lot like the Mandeans, with the difference being that these

284
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,680
were devotees of the goddess Cotus and Dionysus and not the King of Light.

285
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:52,080
Elkabiodes, who was a fellow student with Plato under Socrates, was an Athenian politician.

286
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:59,520
Eupolis wrote hostile polemics against both Socrates and Elkabiodes and especially was

287
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,960
not fond of the Corinthian Baptist cult. During the wars between Athens and Sparta,

288
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:11,920
Eupolis found himself, as fate would have it, serving under a fleet led by Elkabiodes

289
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:19,600
in the Sicilian expedition. And Elkabiodes had Eumopolis drowned in retaliation to his plays

290
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:27,360
about him. According to the sources from Xenophon and Plato, Socrates and Elkabiodes saved each

291
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:34,160
other multiple times from death during these wars. Elkabiodes was defeated by Lysander and

292
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:42,640
he fled to the Persian court of Archiserses II, but was killed along the way. Socrates, on the other

293
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:49,600
hand, was condemned by the Ellosinian herofans and Athenian religious authorities for leading the

294
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:57,600
youth astray in importing foreign gods. His martyrdom is very comparable to Jesus' death

295
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:05,040
and condemnation. His successor Plato wrote an entire dialogue about Elkabiodes

296
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:13,120
and massive dialogues about Socrates. Plato, in his Republic, expressed his discontent

297
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,760
with the religious order of his day. He states in Book 3 of the Republic that he wanted to replace

298
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,360
Homer and Hesiod with more righteous ideas and better examples for the youth to live by,

299
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:32,400
even going as far as desiring a heaven for the righteous and a hell for the sinners. Plato and

300
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:40,000
Aristotle after him claimed that Zooraster was a teacher of Pythagoras and how the pre-Socratic

301
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,760
masters got their wisdom from the Egyptians, Phoenicians, and Babylonians. It is certainly

302
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:52,000
possible that these Baptists in Corinth, who were charged with worshipping foreign gods,

303
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,440
may have already been on their way to something close to a protonosticism with influences from

304
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:04,560
the Magi. Aristotle tells us that several Magi even attended the funeral of Plato himself.

305
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:12,320
Aristotle was also charged by the religious leaders of Athens with blasphemy and was forced

306
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:19,840
to flee Athens and take his own life. Then Aristotle's successor, Theophrastus, also

307
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:26,480
was charged with blasphemy as well. Even Theophrastus's successor after that, Demetrius,

308
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:33,280
Philarium, was forced out of Athens, fled to Alexandria, Egypt, and according to Josephus,

309
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,720
was present during the creation of the Greek Pentateuch.

310
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,320
The reason why I bring all this up is to set you all up with what I think is the most

311
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:52,400
important question regarding early Christianity, something I have never yet hear anyone ask,

312
00:39:53,280 --> 00:40:01,520
the question being, who was Paul writing to? If you haven't really thought deeply about this question,

313
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,000
you might just say, Paul is writing to the churches in Corinth, in Rome, in Ephesus.

314
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:13,120
But wait a second, if Paul is writing these letters in the 40s and 50s, and Jesus just

315
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:20,240
recently died in 33, then how is it possible that Jesus' disciples have already successfully

316
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:26,400
went across the entire Roman Empire in one decade, converted thousands of Greeks and

317
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:32,400
Roman pagans, set up assemblies and churches in major cities throughout Anatolia, Greece,

318
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,560
and Italy, and gained support from rich patrons? Weren't these just teenage fishermen?

319
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,760
To me, this is not only impossible, but would be a far greater miracle than Jesus

320
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,960
healing the sick and making wine from water. This would be the greatest miracle of all,

321
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:57,680
and yet it's not explained in any of the texts, other than a few vague verses in Luke

322
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:05,360
Acts, about 70 disciples, magically dispersing far and wide. Let's put the fairy tale aside

323
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:12,000
and get real for a moment. There must have been an existing order of religious culture

324
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:19,440
in these areas before Jesus and Paul. For starters, we know from the sources that there was a thriving

325
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:26,080
Hellenized Jewish community living throughout the urban cities of Greece, Egypt, and Turkey

326
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:34,320
between 200 B.C. through the Common Era, era stimulus of Alexandria, a Greek middle Platonist Jew

327
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:41,920
living in the 2nd century B.C., wrote about Orpheus and Mousseus as Jewish prophets among

328
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:48,560
the Greeks, as well as Plato and Pythagoras as God-fearing Greeks worthy of reverence.

329
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:57,040
And Thilo of Alexandria, his successor, wrote extensively on concepts like the logos

330
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:04,240
and God having an heir to inherit the Kingdom of Heaven. Thilo also wrote on how the laws of

331
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:11,120
Moses and the Torah were not to be taken literally and were spiritual laws that could be interpreted

332
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:19,280
depending on the situation. They leaned heavily on the laws and philosophy of Plato, which dominated

333
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:26,880
the time period. These mixing of Platonic and Jewish ideas would set the stage for Christian

334
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:35,040
theology and would be heavily borrowed from by the Gospel authors and Paul. It is quite possible

335
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:41,680
that these Jewish communities who spoke Greek and adopted Greek customs followed Judaism to a

336
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:48,960
moderate degree, and were likely to be less interested in following Mosaic law in a fundamental

337
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:55,840
sense, and these would be the most likely to convert to Christianity. And it sure makes sense

338
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:02,640
that these very people would be more inclined to accept Paul's teachings. But I still don't think

339
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:09,760
this would be enough to explain the massive network of Christian churches existing so early on during

340
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:23,120
Paul's time. Professor John Kloppenborg's late academic sensation, known as Christ's associations,

341
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:30,960
does a thorough analysis and comparison between ancient Greco-Roman cults and associations

342
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:39,360
of deities in Athens, Corinth, Macedonia, Ephesus, and other cities throughout the Greco-Roman world

343
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:46,000
of the Hellenistic period through antiquity. He posits that the early Christ assemblies

344
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,400
throughout the Roman Empire would most likely operate in a similar manner to the assemblies

345
00:43:52,400 --> 00:44:00,560
of devotees of other deities. He compares inscriptions on templates and stones from archaeological digs

346
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:08,800
of temples and dining halls. One of these groups that is described is known as the Cult of Theos

347
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:18,160
Hipsistos, or God Most High in Greek. This cult flourished in Corinth, Athens, Macedonia,

348
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:25,280
Phrygia, Cappadocia, from the 3rd century BC until the time of the Christian takeover of Roman

349
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:32,400
religion in the 4th century. These people, called Hipsisterians, were shipped one god,

350
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:41,360
either in the form of Theos Hipsistos, God Most High, or Zeus Hipsistos, Zeus Most High,

351
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:50,000
and sometimes Zeus Sebasius Hipsistos. Their theology seems to possess a platonic cosmology

352
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:58,320
of one perfect, nameless, unbegotten creator who creates the world with his lesser daemons and

353
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:07,760
angels. His temples usually possess no images of God, or just a symbol of an eagle with a wreath,

354
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:16,240
and very rarely in the form of a statue of Zeus. But most of these cults worshiped God with no

355
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:22,240
images, similar to the Temple of Jerusalem and how the Jews forbid the images of God.

356
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:30,160
These very Hipsisterians were in close proximity to the thriving Jewish communities

357
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:37,680
living in Greece and Turkey. It should also be noted that Hipsistos is the Greek title

358
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,760
for the God of the Old Testament, as Eleon is the same word in the Hebrew Bible.

359
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:51,200
It is highly likely that these very people are among the earliest converts to Christianity.

360
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:57,840
These are the people who the author of Acts refers to as God-fearers.

361
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:05,040
At Caesarea, there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in what was known as the Italian

362
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:12,000
Regiment. He and all his family were devout and God-fearing. He gave generously to those in need

363
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,440
and prayed to God regularly. Acts 10

364
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:24,800
These God-fearers are Gentiles who worship God Most High, aka Theos Hipsistos. Gregory of

365
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:30,320
Naziansus, one of the 4th century Church Fathers, claims that his parents were once

366
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:36,640
Hipsisterians before converting to Christianity. Showing the close proximity of these groups,

367
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:43,120
he describes them as syncretic Jewish pagan groups that does not worship idols,

368
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:51,440
reveres lamps and fires, worships the almighty Pontocrator, and they keep the Sabbath

369
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:58,960
and adhere to dietary restrictions. But they do not circumcise and says that this cult formed

370
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:06,960
from the native Cappadocian cult of Zeus Sebasius, a Dionysian cult and integrated

371
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:13,840
with the cult of Yahweh Saboeth during a time when many Jews were moving to that region.

372
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:21,120
What early Christian assemblies had in common with the devotees of Theos Hipsistos

373
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:27,520
and the Dionysian Baptist groups in Corinth was that they all seemed to run in a similar

374
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:33,520
fashion, similar to modern-day unions. These members would often be given titles,

375
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:41,200
similar to titles found among Dionysiac groups such as Torchbearer, Thesmophorii,

376
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:49,440
Templebearer, Neophorii, and Christbearer, Christophorii. Oftentimes, inscriptions found

377
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,960
bearing at these ancient sites would be the names of members of these cultic associations.

378
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,800
Stone masons, silversmiths, goldsmiths, leather tanners, boat builders, fishermen,

379
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:10,480
tax collectors, etc. Depending on the location, these cultic associations looked a lot like

380
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:17,280
modern trade unions who got together on Sundays for mass, shared communal meals together,

381
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:25,280
held Eucharistic rituals, and buried their dead and shared catacombs. They had systems of

382
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:32,080
healthcare, they had egalitarian social networks, and rotated jobs in a democratic way,

383
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:40,480
similar to the ancient Athenian democratic associations. Women, plebeians, freed slaves,

384
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:47,600
people of lowly rank in the Roman Empire, were treated equally with patrician and equestrian

385
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:55,520
rank members. These progressive, egalitarian aspects of the cult was not only apparent in

386
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:02,240
Dionysian associations in times past, but Christians also had a biblical reason for this.

387
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:09,680
Jesus has quoted saying, Many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.

388
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:16,800
And again, I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone

389
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:22,480
who is rich to enter the kingdom of God. Jesus is also said to have given a parable

390
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,840
about workers in the field, not working the same hours, but getting the same pay,

391
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:34,720
which he says in Matthew 20, For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner, who went out early in

392
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:40,800
the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day,

393
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:46,560
and sent them into his vineyard. About nine o'clock, he went out and saw the others standing

394
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:53,040
in the marketplace, doing nothing. He told them, You also go and work in my vineyard,

395
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:58,160
and I will pay you whatever is right. So they went. He went out again at noon,

396
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:03,600
and about three in the afternoon, and did the same thing. About five in the afternoon,

397
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:08,640
he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, Why have you been standing here all

398
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:15,040
day, doing nothing? Because no one has hired us, they said. He said to them, You also go and work

399
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:20,880
in my vineyard. When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, Call the workers

400
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:27,120
and pay them their wages, beginning with the last hired, and the going on to the first. The workers

401
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:33,360
who were hired at about five in the afternoon came and each received a denarius. So when those who

402
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:40,240
came were hired first, they have expected to be received more. But each of them also received

403
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:46,160
a denarius when they received that they began to grumble against the landowner. Those who were hired

404
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:53,280
last worked only one hour, they said. And you have made them equal to us, who have borne the

405
00:50:53,280 --> 00:51:00,240
burden of the work and the heat of the day. But he answered one of them, I am not being unfair to

406
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:06,640
you friend. Didn't you agree to work for a denarius? Take your pay and go. I want to give

407
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:13,040
the one who was hired last the same as I gave you. So the last will be first and the first will be

408
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:19,520
last. Not only that, but the author of Acts relates that the new initiates would be required

409
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:26,800
to sell their homes and all their private property and give all their money to the feet of the Apostles

410
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:33,360
as Acts two states, they devoted themselves to the Apostles teaching and to fellowship,

411
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:40,080
to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Everyone was filled with all the many wonders and signs

412
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:46,160
performed by the Apostles. All the believers were together and had everything in common.

413
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:53,040
They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. Every day they continued

414
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:58,880
to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad

415
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:04,960
and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all people. And the Lord added to

416
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,040
their number daily, those who are being saved, Acts two.

417
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:22,160
This egalitarian approach is what we find in these early Christian groups.

418
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:29,200
One of the earliest Christians on record mentioned in Kelsus is the Carpocrations.

419
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:35,280
The group was started by a man named Carpocrates who lived in the first century in Alexandria

420
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:43,200
within the Church of Mark. He was a student of Menander who was in turn a student of none other

421
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:50,720
than Simon Magus who was baptized by Philip and given the Holy Spirit by Peter according to Acts.

422
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:57,520
This Menander, according to Irenaeus, was rumored to have performed miracles with his baptism

423
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:04,160
in which his disciples did not grow old in appearance and that he gave them eternal youth.

424
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:11,120
Other first century Christian leaders who were initiated by Simon Magus were Cerdo,

425
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:17,600
Basilides, and Ceternius who started churches in Antioch, Syria and Rome.

426
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:25,440
Carpocrates, along with his wife Marcellina, started their own Christian church in Cephalonia,

427
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:33,680
called the Agape. He ran his assembly according to Acts that we just read where everyone was

428
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:40,080
required to sell their property and take a position among the assembly. Everyone lived

429
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:46,720
equally in this group. Food and water was evenly distributed among them and they dropped out of

430
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:54,560
Roman society to live reclusively, devoted to worshiping God, singing hymns, baptisms,

431
00:53:54,560 --> 00:54:01,520
Eucharists, and reading the sayings of Jesus. These Carpocratian Christians are among the earliest

432
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:09,120
in the sources to show anything close to a Trinitarian theology. However, this Trinity was

433
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:16,480
slightly different, God, the Logos, and Zoe. At first this might sound heretical and strange,

434
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:24,400
but if you read the Gospel of John in Greek, it states that the Logos and Zoe were with God in

435
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:32,320
the beginning. Zoe is translated into English as life and since the English authors translate

436
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:38,960
Logos into word with a capital W, it can appear that life or Zoe is not important.

437
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:47,200
They translate this noun without a capital letter, making word look like it stands out and life not

438
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:53,680
even looking important. However, the oldest Greek fragments of John do not have any distinctions

439
00:54:53,680 --> 00:55:00,720
between capital letters and lowercase letters, unless it's the start of a new passage. So translating

440
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:08,480
Zoe and Logos both as nouns is a valid way to translate the text. The correct translation

441
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:16,160
of the Gospel of John is as follows. In the beginning was the Logos and the Logos was with God

442
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:23,520
and the Logos was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through the Logos all things were

443
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:31,120
made. Without him nothing was made that has been seen. In him was Zoe and that Zoe was the light

444
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:38,640
of all humankind. The light of Zoe shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it.

445
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:46,480
John 1. They were not alone in this Trinitarian doctrine of the Logos and Zoe. Other Christian

446
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:54,320
sects such as the Valentinians, Sathians, Nascines, as well as the Simonians and others had this doctrine.

447
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,560
I will talk more about these groups later in the video.

448
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:08,800
Marcellina, the wife of Carpocrates, was so influential in her time that she was invited

449
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:17,680
to Rome during the papacy of Anacetus in the 150s. This shows that the so-called Gnostics

450
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:24,000
were still a big part of the Church late into the 2nd century. She attracted large numbers of

451
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:31,200
followers and founded a sect known as the Marcellians mentioned by Celsus. During her time,

452
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:38,000
many women held high positions in the Church just as Mary and Martha held high positions

453
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:45,440
during Jesus' ministry. Marcellina and her followers believed in Antinomianism,

454
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:53,280
also known as Libertinism, the idea that obedience to laws and regulations is unnecessary

455
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:59,680
in order to attain salvation, something that Jesus also preached. But this is considered heretical

456
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:06,480
later, even though it lines up with the Pauline teachings in Galatians 4, the allegory on Christian

457
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:13,200
freedom about not being bound to the law. Tell me, you who want to be under the law,

458
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:19,760
are you not aware of what the law says? For it is written that Abraham had two sons,

459
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:27,680
one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman. His son, by the slave woman,

460
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:35,120
was born according to the flesh, but his son, by the free woman, was born as a result

461
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:41,200
of a divine promise. These things are to be taken figuratively. The woman represents

462
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:47,840
two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves.

463
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:56,480
This is Hagar. Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city

464
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:02,880
of Jerusalem because she is in slavery with her children. But the Jerusalem that is above

465
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:09,840
freedom is free and she is our mother. Marcellina thought that Jesus was only a man,

466
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:18,080
but saw him as a model to be emulated, albeit one which a believer was capable of surpassing.

467
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:24,800
Marcellina's community appears to have sought to literally implement the foundational

468
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:32,560
carpocration teaching of social egalitarianism. The Marcellians in particular are reported to

469
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:39,440
have branded their disciples on the insides of their right earlobes with a tattoo and venerated

470
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:46,800
images of Jesus as well as the Greek philosophers such as Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle.

471
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:54,240
Marcellina thought that Mary Magdalene and Mary of Bethany were female followers of Jesus

472
00:58:54,880 --> 00:59:00,960
who are mentioned in the gospels and who were believed to know the mysteries of the kingdom of

473
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:06,480
God that the other disciples did not know. In the formative years of Christianity,

474
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:15,920
women held significant positions within various sects serving as prophetesses, educators, healers,

475
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:22,560
evangelists, and leaders of congregations. Figures such as Mary Magdalene and Mary of Bethany

476
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:27,760
were notable female disciples of Jesus, referenced in the biblical narratives,

477
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:34,240
reputed to have understood the teachings of Jesus, the secrets of God's realm.

478
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:46,240
Women like Mary and her sister Martha set the example for the individuals such as Marcellina

479
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:55,040
and other women who took on preaching roles. The apostle Paul cites a doctrine in Galatians 3

480
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:02,560
likely recited during baptismal rites asserting the equality of Christ in all,

481
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:09,840
regardless of ethnic background, social status, or gender. There is neither Jew nor Greek,

482
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:17,440
there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female, for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.

483
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:27,680
By the end of the first century, figures like Marcian of Sinop were known to ordain women

484
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:35,440
as church elders on par with men. In the 100s, the Valentinians acknowledged the parity between

485
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:42,640
women and men. The Montanist movement identified two female prophets, Maximilla and Prisca,

486
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:50,640
as pivotal to their foundation. However, such spiritual leaders, including Marcellina, faced

487
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:59,120
heavy criticism from mainstream theologians who castigated them with accusations of insanity,

488
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:07,120
immorality, and demonic influence. Tertullian, an early Christian author, voiced his objection

489
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:12,240
to the active participation of women in religious matters.

490
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:20,080
Condemning their assertiveness and readiness to teach, debate, perform exorcisms, heal,

491
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:26,560
and possibly even administer baptisms. He particularly targeted a North African woman,

492
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:36,480
referring to her derisively as that viper. What I find ironic is that both Jesus and Paul

493
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:44,000
kept women in high standing in their ministries, like Paul traveling the Roman Empire with Thutus,

494
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:51,920
and writing to Priscus and Achilla, Rufus' mother as well, yet these heretics are condemned by the

495
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:58,960
later church for putting women in high places. This is also why many scholars, including myself,

496
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:04,400
don't think Timothy is an authentic Pauline letter, with its call to keep women away from

497
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:10,800
teaching and for them to cover their heads in church seems completely antithetical to the

498
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:16,240
early libertine Christians in anti-law egalitarian message of Christianity.

499
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:24,240
First Timothy seems way too concerned with bishop laws and regulations to be considered

500
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:32,400
an early Christian letter from the time of Paul. In fact, Marcian, an early bishop who I will speak

501
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:39,760
at great length about in this video, held in his possession the oldest known New Testament Bible,

502
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:48,080
including Luke X and the Pauline epistles, but not First Timothy or Second Timothy or Titus,

503
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:54,640
which I think proves that those texts are not authentic. The text is only used among the

504
01:02:54,640 --> 01:03:02,080
proto-Orthodox types, like Irenaeus, who also taught that only bishops can have authority,

505
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:07,360
and that the bishops are the representatives of God on earth. First Timothy just happens to contain

506
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:14,480
a message that looks a lot like anti-nostic propaganda. Oh Timothy, guard what was committed

507
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:20,400
to your trust, avoiding the profane and idle babblings and contradictions of what is falsely

508
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:27,040
called gnosis. By professing it, some have strayed concerning the faith. First Timothy.

509
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:35,120
If this text truly was authentic and from Paul, Marcellina and the Carpocrations would never

510
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:42,000
have made it past the first century in the church, let alone would Marcellina be invited to Rome

511
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:50,400
by anesthetists in the 150s. These Carpocrations also were the first Christians to make images of

512
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:57,040
Jesus and Mary to venerate and worship. Among their doctrines was the process of apotheosis,

513
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:03,760
or deification, through retaining gnosis. This was considered the highest form of salvation

514
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:12,080
that a baptized Christian can attain. They believed that Jesus was one who attained the highest level

515
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:20,960
of gnosis and was begotten by God through his apotheosis. They also believed that Pythagoras

516
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:29,120
and Plato also attained gnosis and were also not only deified, but the Carpocrations also

517
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:35,680
made statues of Plato and Pythagoras and venerated them along the statue of Jesus.

518
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:42,240
The idea of being begotten by God would be completely foreign among Jews,

519
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:50,240
but to the Greco-Roman world, this was nothing new. Caesar Augustus, Alexander the Great,

520
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:59,040
Seleucus Nicanor, Demetrius Poliocretis, just to name a few are people who were considered to

521
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:08,160
attain apotheosis while being alive. When Demetrius Poliocretis entered the city of Athens, they had

522
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:15,760
images of him in the city next to Demeter and Dionysus so that he can be worshiped as a God.

523
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:21,120
The same can be said about Caesar Augustus and Alexander the Great.

524
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:33,280
Of these Carpocrations who attained apotheosis was the son of Carpocrates and Marcellina,

525
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:39,360
who were married and their child was named Epiphanes. Epiphanes died when he was just 17 years

526
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:47,600
old, but he was deified on the island of Cephalonia around 120 AD. In his short life,

527
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:55,200
he wrote a masterpiece called On Justice. Here are some passages from this text to give you an

528
01:05:55,200 --> 01:06:02,640
idea of their doctrines. The righteousness of God is a kind of sharing along with equality.

529
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:09,600
There is equality in the heaven, which is stretched out in all directions and contains the

530
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:16,640
entire earth in its circle. The night reveals all the stars equally, the light of the sun,

531
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:23,120
which is the cause of the daytime and the father of light. God pours out from above upon the earth

532
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:29,520
an equal measure to all have power to see, for all see alike, since here is no distinction between

533
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:37,280
rich and poor. People and governor, stupid and clever, female and male, free men and slaves,

534
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:43,840
even the irrational animals are not accorded any different treatment. But in just the same way,

535
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:51,120
God pours out from above the sunlight equally upon all the animals. He establishes his justice

536
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:58,640
to both good and bad by seeing that none is able to get more than his share and deprive his neighbor

537
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:06,000
so that he has twice the light his neighbor has. The sun causes food to grow for all living beings

538
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:12,720
alike. The universal justice is given to all equally. In this respect, there is no difference

539
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:18,720
between the species of oxen and particular oxen, between the species of pigs and particular pigs,

540
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:25,280
between the species of sheep and particular sheep, and so with all the rest. In them,

541
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:33,440
universality manifests injustice. Furthermore, all plants after their kind are sown equally in the

542
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:41,520
earth. Common nourishment grows for all beasts which feed on the earth's produce. To all it is

543
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:48,160
alike. It is regulated by no law, but rather is harmoniously available to all through the gift

544
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:56,080
of him who gave it and commanded it to grow. The apparent themes of this text show heavy

545
01:07:56,080 --> 01:08:03,280
influences from both Jesus and Plato. The stressing on equality coming from God is apparent

546
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:09,680
throughout the text and can be seen as the force behind the culture of early Christianity and

547
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:17,200
communal life. He goes on to say, as the laws could not punish men who were ignorant of them,

548
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:24,800
they taught man to transgress for a particularity of the laws cut up and destroyed, the universal

549
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:32,560
equality of the divine law. The idea that the law is given for the lawless and the righteous have no

550
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:40,320
need for the law is arguably the most central doctrine of Christianity itself. Jesus and Paul

551
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:46,000
taught that the law was only given for the lawless. Luke 11 states,

552
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:17,680
What goes into someone's mouth does not defile them, but what comes out of their mouth, that is

553
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:24,560
what defiles them. Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law,

554
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:31,200
so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God. Therefore no one

555
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:37,360
will be declared righteous in God's sight by the works of the law, rather through the law we become

556
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:46,000
conscious of our sin, Paul. In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not performed by

557
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:53,360
human hands. Your whole self ruled by the flesh was put off when you were circumcised by Christ.

558
01:09:55,440 --> 01:10:01,280
You who have heard that it was said, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, but I tell you,

559
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:06,640
do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other

560
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:13,600
cheek also. Give to the one who asks you and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.

561
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:18,240
You have heard that it was said, love your neighbor and hate your enemy,

562
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:23,200
but I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you that you may be

563
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:30,400
children of your father in heaven. He causes his son to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain

564
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:39,280
on the righteous and the unrighteous Jesus. And there you have it, Jesus, like carpocrates,

565
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:49,760
like epiphanies, like Marcellina, using the sun as an example of God's equality of righteousness

566
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:56,400
for all under him. The carpocration ideas are biblically accurate and are aligned with Jesus

567
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:03,440
and Paul. The core doctrine of Jesus was that authority can only come from God and rejected

568
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:10,080
the scribes, Pharisees and Sadducees who obsessed over the law and the scriptures,

569
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:18,400
which are external rather than focusing on being righteous within. I also think it should be noted

570
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:25,920
that Jesus in the same passage says that you may be children of your father in heaven,

571
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:32,480
implying that anyone can be begotten by God, something that the carpocrations taught. Epiphanies

572
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:38,240
was not the first Christian to attain this level of salvation and became deified besides Jesus,

573
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:45,040
of course. His father, Carpocrates, was said to have attained perfection through gnosis.

574
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:53,200
Carpocrates' teacher, Menander, also declared to be a divine Messiah and had the power of God

575
01:11:53,200 --> 01:12:00,960
in his quoted saying, The primary power continues unknown to all, but that he himself is the person

576
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:07,600
who has been sent forth from the presence of the invisible beings as a savior for the deliverance

577
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:16,960
of men. Also, Menander's teacher, Simon Magus, was a Samaritan and was also deified by his followers.

578
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:25,280
Simon Magus was deified in Rome along with his wife, Helena, and they were depicted in images

579
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:32,240
in the guise of Jupiter and Minerva. The opponents of Simon used this as a way to condemn them for

580
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:40,560
heresy. However, Simon told his followers, If anyone on seeing the images of either Simon or Helen

581
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:48,800
shall call them by the names Jupiter or Minerva, he is cast out as showing ignorance of the mysteries.

582
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:58,560
A statue of an old Etruscan god, Semosencus, that was still erected in Rome on Tiber Island

583
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:06,000
at that time was apparently also used to represent Simon. Some accounts say that he was so popular

584
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:13,440
in Rome that it was Emperor Claudius himself that erected this statue. This statue was designed

585
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:20,560
with the archetype of Apollo and had the club of Hercules, possibly denoting that Simon was the son

586
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:29,360
of God. It is also said that Simon was identified with Heracles Melchart and was called Shemesh

587
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:37,600
or son while Helen was identified with Selena Estarte and called Luna according to Clement.

588
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:45,520
This idea of initiates having nicknames or titles of gods is something practiced throughout many

589
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:52,880
Greco-Roman assemblies. We see this with Mark, Antony, and Cleopatra being Dionysus, Osiris,

590
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:58,960
and Aphrodite Isis. I would even go as far as say that the gospel writers themselves

591
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:06,880
linked Jesus to certain divinities by writing stories of him doing similar miracles and wonders

592
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:14,880
as the heroes and gods before him such as Jesus casting a legion into swine like surgery does

593
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:21,840
in Homer's Odyssey. Also casting a legion into swine where Jesus being called the true vine,

594
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:27,920
a title that Dionysus also has, and the light of the world, a title that Apollo also has. Simon

595
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:34,400
Magus was said to have met Helen in Samaria and that Helen was originally one of the disciples

596
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:41,040
of John the Baptist who considered her as his favorite and most beloved of the 30 disciples.

597
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:47,600
Simon Magus was opposed by a Christian named Docetius who was considered the standing one

598
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:52,720
and leader of the sect of Baptists but was eventually taken over by the Holy Spirit

599
01:14:53,280 --> 01:15:01,520
and kneeled down to worship Simon Magus ordering his entire rank of 30 disciples to follow Simon

600
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:10,320
instead. After this Simon took Helen as his wife and left Samaria and traveled to Rome

601
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:15,360
and was met by Peter during the reign of Emperor Claudius.

602
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:28,000
Simon Magus wrote a lengthy text called The Great Declaration which was central to the

603
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:34,960
Valentinians and Sethians, both early Christian sects who I will discuss later. In this text are

604
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:43,440
found heavy influences of Zoroastrianism, Platonism, Peripatetic, Stoic, and Epicurean concepts with

605
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:51,520
a wide mixture of Hellenic and Hebraic ideas on top of Pythagorean numerology. The text begins

606
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:58,480
with Moses' proclamation that God is a consuming fire from Deuteronomy 4. Simon

607
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:05,200
wolfed together this concept with Heraclitus philosophy which posited fire as the fundamental

608
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:12,160
element of all existence. Simon referred to this foundational element as an endless power,

609
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:18,320
dunmus apparentos and proposed that it resides within human beings who are created of flesh and

610
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:26,320
blood. However, Simon argued that fire was not as simple as commonly perceived. In a matter akin

611
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:34,960
to the Stoics and Zoroastrians, he imagined it as an entity with intelligence. From this eternal

612
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:42,400
entity emanated the created universe that we are familiar with, structured with six foundational

613
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:50,720
elements or roots, each having an internal and external aspect, paired as such, mind and intention,

614
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:58,640
noose and epinoa equating to heaven and earth, voice and name, fone, anoma, the sun and moon,

615
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:05,360
reasoning and reflection, logeesmas and enthumesis, to air and water. These six roots were also termed

616
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:11,440
as six powers. Interwoven with all was the supreme endless power which is described as

617
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:16,880
that which is, was and will be. This power held the potential within every human being

618
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:24,080
could unfold to its vast extent, the insignificant could become significant and the minute could

619
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:30,880
expand endlessly. Simon taught that this minute essence within the body, not only to the spiritual

620
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:36,640
attuned, was akin to the kingdom of heaven and comparable to the mustard seeds potential for

621
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:43,360
growth. It is within our capacity to cultivate this essence and it is this very potential that

622
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:51,360
the phrase, that we may not be condemned with the world, 1 Corinthians 11 alludes to, for if one

623
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:57,920
does not actualize this divine likeness within oneself, it perishes with the physical demise.

624
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:04,880
Simon warned, echoing the biblical sentiment that the unproductive tree is destined to be

625
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:10,960
honed down and cast into the flames. The entire text presents an unusual amalgamation

626
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:17,200
between Greek and Jewish traditions, employing allegorical interpretations for both classical

627
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:24,160
Greek epics and the writings of Moses. It includes a symbolic reading of the Garden of Eden story

628
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:30,720
and equates the Pentateuch to the five human senses. There's also an esoteric discourse

629
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:38,080
on the oneness of all existence that mirrors the verses sung by a Brahmin in their hymns.

630
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:46,480
Its prose sheds light on the narrative involving Helen articulating a vision of singular power

631
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:53,600
that is split between the celestial and the terrestrial, self-curating and self-sustaining

632
01:18:53,600 --> 01:19:00,560
and is simultaneously its own kin and consort embodying a singular indivisible origin of all

633
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:13,520
things. The Simonians put a big emphasis on baptism and levels of initiation. They claimed

634
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:20,000
that baptism, following by attaining the Holy Spirit, were separate, citing John that we were

635
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:26,560
to be baptized with the Holy Ghost and with fire. The Simonians maintained that the normal water

636
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:32,880
baptism was a mere form and that they had the real baptism. For as soon as their neophytes

637
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:38,320
went down into the water, a fire appeared on it. This is also mentioned in the book of Acts,

638
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:45,280
that after Simon Magus and the Samaritan village was baptized by Philip, Peter came to the city

639
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:51,760
to lay hands on the initiates so that they can have also the Holy Spirit. This gives credibility

640
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:57,440
to the Gnostic idea that there are levels of salvation beyond just having faith in being a

641
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:04,400
Christian. Simon Magus would later be heavily opposed by the orthodoxy that began to emerge

642
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:11,440
in the latter half of the 2nd century. Writers like Irenaeus, Hippolytus, Justin Martyr claiming

643
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:18,880
that Simon met his demise in a horrible way. However, these stories about his demise in the

644
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:26,160
church are conflicting and don't make a lot of sense. For instance, a text known as Acts of Peter

645
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:32,560
which was written around the 3rd century depicts Peter as the main protagonist leading the Church

646
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:40,480
of Rome and being opposed by Simon Magus who is depicted as the main antagonist. This text seems

647
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:46,880
to be more reflective of a deeper layer that consists of the early Christian schism between

648
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:53,120
the Gnostics and orthodoxy of that time period. In this text taking place during the reign of Nero,

649
01:20:53,760 --> 01:21:00,880
Simon Magus and Simon Peter have a magic duel in which Simon Magus shows he is capable of

650
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:08,960
levitation and flies high into the sky. Peter responds with his own cast of magic as he strikes

651
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:15,680
down Simon Magus down from the sky and instantly kills him. In another source by Hippolytus,

652
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:23,280
Simon Magus was in Rome with both Paul and Peter and was very successful in swaying people over

653
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:29,680
by his magical arts. Peter and Paul both reject him and then he leaves Rome and goes back to

654
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:37,200
Samaria where he tried to prove to the Samaritans that he is the Christ by having himself buried

655
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:43,120
with the promise that he would be raised up on the 3rd day. According to Hippolytus, Simon Magus

656
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:49,440
never gets raised up and thus meets his end. A 3rd century text called Pseudo-Clementines,

657
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:54,800
similar to the Acts of Peter, gives a legend about Clement of Rome and Peter as the main

658
01:21:54,800 --> 01:22:01,360
protagonist against Simon Magus. In this text, it is during the reign of Claudius, not Nero,

659
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:08,160
that Simon Magus was opposed by Peter. After losing many magical duels, he jumps off a tall

660
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:14,160
building to his own death, not by the magic of Peter this time. This story can't even be true

661
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:18,480
because Clement would have been less than 10 years old during the reign of Claudius.

662
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:23,920
All three of these legends about Simon Magus' demise in Rome conflict with one another and

663
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:31,600
Justin Martyr relates that Simon Magus was rejected by Peter and Paul in Samaria before he ever went

664
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:37,520
to Rome at all. If that was the case, why would Simon Magus be welcomed into Rome by the church,

665
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:43,360
let alone Peter in the first place? The Book of Acts gives no such account of Simon's demise.

666
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:49,280
The Book of Acts leaves Simon Magus on a positive note as one of the earliest disciples to be

667
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:54,800
baptized by Philip and attain the Holy Spirit by Peter himself. That would be such a high

668
01:22:54,800 --> 01:23:01,280
degree of salvation that rendering him a heretic would make the Holy Spirit and baptism useless.

669
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:07,920
Some Christians today might point to Simon's sorcery in his attempt to buy the Holy Spirit

670
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:14,480
with money as a clear sign that he was always a heretic and should be rejected as such. However,

671
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:19,520
this happens before Peter prays for him and lays hands on him to give him the Holy Spirit.

672
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:26,960
And if this makes Simon Magus evil, then what should we say about Paul, who not only hunted

673
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:33,040
down Christians before he was saved by the Holy Spirit, but also talks about how he opposed

674
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:40,400
both Peter and James to their faces? Simon Magus was saved before Paul, and the author of Acts

675
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:47,840
ends the narrative about Simon on a positive note with Peter, Simon and Philip preaching the good news

676
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:54,080
to the people of Samaria. If Simon was rejected at that time, there would be no time for Simon to

677
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:59,360
start his own sect of Christianity and travel to Rome and be accepted by the church there.

678
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:05,760
So many of his doctrines were central to the Valentinians and Scythians, and none of that

679
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:12,080
would be possible had his story ended there. Also, Acts was written in the early 2nd to

680
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:19,680
mid 2nd century, and the author would have known how evil Simon was by that time if this was the case.

681
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:30,960
What I think is more likely is that a political divide between the Christians took place sometime

682
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:38,880
between 140 and 150 AD, causing a schism between the followers of Marcian, Valentinus,

683
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:46,480
and the so-called Gnostics with the followers of Justin Marder, Taysin, and Aranaus. The latter group

684
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:50,720
seems to have won this schism, but I will speak more on this later in the video.

685
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:56,800
But due to this schism, it is likely that Simon Magus became the main target of criticism

686
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:03,840
due to his vast influences on the members of the church like Valentinus and Marcus Magus,

687
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:11,280
who used Simonian doctrines. Due to Simon being so early on and so many learning from him,

688
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:15,760
it would be strategic to cut out the branch from the root, which is Simon Magus.

689
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:21,920
The Simonian influence on the early Gentile church was so vast, it can be easily compared to the vast

690
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:28,160
influence of Paul. From this line of Simon Magus, we get Menander, Cerdo, Saturnius,

691
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:35,520
and the Carpelcretians who have already mentioned. Cerdo, Valentinus, Marcian, Marcus Magus were all

692
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:42,880
in Rome during the papacy of Hygenus, decades after the papacy of Clement, which shows that

693
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:49,920
this schism comes much later than reported by the Heresiologists. All of these early church figures

694
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:56,800
show dependence on Simon's doctrines, but are equally influenced by Pauline tradition as well.

695
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:02,640
These are Christians who reject the Old Testament Mosaic law, dependence, in favor

696
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:14,800
for a more spiritual approach to salvation. Another student of Simon Magus was Basilides.

697
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:21,440
This Basilides became a famous Christian mystic and teacher in Alexandria, Egypt,

698
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:27,840
during the first half of the second century. Basilides is arguably the face of Christian

699
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:35,200
Gnosticism. He takes Gnosis to another level. The logo of this channel, which is the symbol of

700
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:42,560
Abraxis, comes from none other than Basilides himself. He taught that the great Archon, Magus

701
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:51,520
Archon, known as Abraxis or Yaho, was the unbegotten Father and the Demiurge who had the highest

702
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:57,600
emanation of light in the universe and produced ions descended from his being,

703
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:05,600
resulting in multiple heavenly realms and angelic powers. With the Jewish God Yelda Boeth

704
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:13,520
identified as one of these angels, Abraxis had the head of a hawk, torso of a man,

705
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:20,240
and legs of serpents, signifying the three elements, air, water, and earth. His name

706
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:27,040
in Greek, Abrasax, equals seven letters for seven planets and days of the week. Consists of three

707
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:32,800
vowels and four consonants, which multiplies, gives the 12 lunar months of a solar calendar.

708
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:41,280
The Dramatria of the name Abraxis equals 365. He designates Abraxis more distinctly as the power

709
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:47,680
above all in the first principle, or Arche, the cause and first archetype of all things,

710
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:55,920
and mentions that the Basilidians refer to 365 as the number of parts in the human body,

711
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:01,680
as well as the days in the year. He says that Abraxis, the Arche, which is the monad,

712
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:10,080
gives birth to the mind Nus, which is the duod, or dyad, along with Sophia, the female principle

713
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:20,480
of Nus. This dyad produces the logos, which is Christ. The world, as well as 365 heavens,

714
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:28,080
was curated in honor of Abraxis, and that Christ was sent not by the maker of the world,

715
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:35,360
but by Abraxis, his true father. Theo's Hipsistos, who I mentioned earlier as a God worshiped by

716
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:43,840
monotheistic Greeks, was also a title given to Abraxis, as well as God Almighty, Pantocrator.

717
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:50,880
Pantocrator is used once by Paul and 2 Corinthians, and nine times in the Book of Revelation,

718
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:56,880
and I saw no temple therein, for the Lord God Almighty, Pantocrator, and the Lamb,

719
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:03,360
are the temple of it. I will be a father to you, and you will be to my sons and daughters,

720
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:05,840
says the Lord Almighty, Pantocrator.

721
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:17,120
It is quite possible that this doctrine of Abraxis is rooted in deep ancient mystery rites.

722
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:23,200
Eusebius, the church historian under Constantine, writes about a Bronze Age priest,

723
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:30,400
named Sanconietin, from 1200 BCE in Phoenicia, cited by Philo in Biblos in the 1st century,

724
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:36,880
who says, The Phoenicians call it Good Daemon. In like manner, the Egyptians also surname

725
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:41,440
Keneath, and they add that the head of a hawk, because of the hawk's activity,

726
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:47,520
Ipice also, who was called among from the chief hero font and sacred scribe,

727
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:51,920
whose work was translated into Greek by Arius of Heracliplus,

728
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:59,760
speaks in an allegory word for word as follows. The first and most divine being is a serpent,

729
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:06,560
with the form of a hawk extremely graceful, which whenever he opens his eyes,

730
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:13,040
filled with light in his original birthplace. But if he shuts his eyes, darkness came on.

731
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:19,360
Ipice here intimates that he is also of a fiery substance, saying,

732
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:24,080
He shone through, for to shine through is a peculiar delight.

733
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:30,640
From the Phoenician phiricities also, took the first ideas of his theology concerning the god

734
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:38,240
called by him Ophion, concerning the Ophianade. Moreover, the Egyptians describe the world

735
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:45,040
from the same idea, engraved the circumference of a circle of the color of the sky and fire,

736
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:51,920
and a hawk shaped serpent stretched across the middle of it. And the whole shape is like Artheta,

737
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:57,520
representing the circle as a world and signifying by the serpent, which connects it to the middle

738
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:04,800
of the Good Daemon. Zoraster, also the Magian, in his sacred collection of Persian records,

739
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:13,760
says in express words, and God has the head of a hawk. He is the first, incorruptible, eternal,

740
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:20,880
uncreated, without parts, most unlike all else, the controller of all good, and he is also the

741
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:29,520
father of good laws and justice, self-taught, natural, imperfect, and wise, and the sole author

742
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:36,480
of the sacred power of nature. Eusebius inserts his passage, just after explaining

743
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:41,920
the mystical sacrifice of the Phoenicians, in which El, the god of the Hebrew Bible,

744
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:48,160
known to the Greeks as the Chronos, sacrifices his only begotten son as a ransom to the avenging

745
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:57,120
Daemons. Eusebius argues that this was a portent of Jesus Christ being crucified as a ransom for

746
01:31:57,120 --> 01:32:11,280
the sins of mankind. Facilities asserted that it was knowledge or gnosis, not faith, that led to

747
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:18,480
salvation. This special knowledge or gnosis was an esoteric truth revealed to humanity

748
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:24,800
by the divine figure of Jesus Christ. Two facilities, faith had no role in achieving

749
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:32,000
salvation. He regarded faith as simply the soul's approval of concepts that don't arouse the sense

750
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:39,920
due to their absence. Furthermore, he saw faith as an innate attribute, not a deliberate choice,

751
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:47,120
suggesting that individuals inherently recognize truths intellectually without the need for proof.

752
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:53,120
Facilities also seemed to link various levels of honor with one's natural faith.

753
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:59,920
Facilities' own scriptural collection featured a unique gospel in addition to the Gospel of John,

754
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:08,480
which explicitly excluded the epistle of Titus as a forgery and incorporating only selected letters

755
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:14,960
from the Pauline corpus, which he thought were authentic. His canon also included a specific

756
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:23,040
text believed to have been authored by facilities or his immediate disciples, such as the interpretation

757
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:30,640
of the Gospels and the Exegetica. In contrast, the established Christian canon omitted the

758
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:38,560
synoptic Gospels, Mark, Matthew, and Luke, deeming them incompatible with the perfection of John's

759
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:46,080
Gospel, which incorporates Christ as the Logost and Sophia as Zoe, ascending from the Father,

760
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:53,360
who is a Braxis. Like Simon Magus, Paul and the Carpocrations, facilities' influence on the

761
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:59,920
Church of Rome as well as the Church of Alexandria was massive. In particular, the Saphians and

762
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:05,920
Valentinians who shared common ideas about God and creation and also used Pythagorean

763
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,480
math and Platonic philosophy to construct their Christian theology.

764
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:23,040
A central text among the Saphians and Valentinians was the Apocryphon of John,

765
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:30,640
an early Christian text revealed to the Apostle John that gives the secret account of creation.

766
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:37,040
The narrative opens with John immersed in sorrow and confusion following the death of Christ. However,

767
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:44,480
Christ manifests before John, transforming an appearance and soothing his distress

768
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:51,040
with a cosmic vision. The highest divine principle is the Monad, an ultimate divine entity

769
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:57,840
described as a singular sovereignty with no higher power. He embodies the absolute,

770
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:04,880
the everlasting, the boundless, the flawless, the sacred, and the self-sufficient. His existence

771
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:10,560
surpasses all understanding and is beyond any definitive measurement or description,

772
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:18,880
existing in a state of unimaginable perfection. The Monad brings forth a dyad, a female divine

773
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:26,400
aspect known as Barbello from his contemplation. She is known as the initial thought and the

774
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:32,240
Monad's reflection. While Barbello is feminine, she is also referred to in both maternal and

775
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:39,040
paternal terms, embodying the concept of the original parent and is characterized by a blending

776
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:45,440
of masculine and feminine traits. As the foremost and hierarchy of divine beings called the Ions,

777
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:51,920
Barbello's interaction with the Monad results in the emergence of additional Ions,

778
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:58,880
as well as the aspects of light and mind. Light, synonymous with Christ and referred to as

779
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:06,720
Christ the Autogenes, works alongside mind or noose in a creative capacity honoring Barbello

780
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:14,560
and the Monad by generating more Ions and forces. The narrative's harmony is disturbed by an Ion

781
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:21,840
named Sophia of the Epinoya who unilaterally embarks on a creative venture without the Monad's spirit

782
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:27,760
or a consort's collaboration. Her thought gives rise to Yelda Boeth, an imperfect and

783
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:34,880
malevolent being with the lion in head and his serpent body. Sophia, recognizing the flawed

784
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:41,840
nature of her creation, attempts to hide Yelda Boeth, keeping him oblivious to the higher realms of

785
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:50,800
the Ions. Despite his solitary origin and lacking the Monad's spirit endorsement, Yelda Boeth possesses

786
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:58,800
sufficient power to emulate the creative acts of the superior Ions, spawning a legion of archons

787
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:05,600
with similar deficiencies and crafting a lesser world for them, made from darkness yet infused

788
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:13,280
with light, pilfered from Sophia, wisdom incarnate. This realm, neither fully dark nor light, is in

789
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:21,840
murky creation. In his ignorance, Yelda Boeth proclaims himself the exclusive and envious deity

790
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:28,480
of this domain. Upon realizing her mistake, Sophia expresses remorse. The spirit of the Monad

791
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:37,920
and other divine powers in Ions seek to redeem Sophia and her aberrant creation. In this attempt,

792
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:44,400
Yelda Boeth and his archons are startled by the Monad's spirit and an image of this spirit is

793
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:52,080
inadvertently imprinted on their domain's surface. Eager to capture this essence, they fashion a human

794
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:59,200
atom in its likeness. Sophia and entities from the higher order perceive a chance to recover the

795
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:06,160
trapped light within Yelda Boeth's dominion and atom. They deceive Yelda Boeth into instilling his

796
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:13,680
spiritual essence into atom and limiting him and simultaneously depleting Yelda Boeth of the light

797
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:21,680
derived from Sophia. Yelda Boeth and the archons, observing Adam's radiant intellect and superiority,

798
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:28,160
attempt to restrain him. They place him in Eden, a deceitful paradise filled with sin and death,

799
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:34,160
hiding the true knowledge that can liberate the light within. Christ confides to John

800
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:41,440
that he prompted Adam to taste the fruit of knowledge and reveals Eve as a helper dispatched

801
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:49,120
by the higher order to free the light imprisoned in atom and Yelda Boeth's creation. As the story

802
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:57,280
unfolds, Yelda Boeth strives to recapture the essence of light, encouraging procreation to craft

803
01:38:57,280 --> 01:39:04,160
new bodies filled with the false spirit which deludes humanity, keeping them in darkness and

804
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:12,400
servitude. John and the Savior engage in a dialogue where Christ elaborates on who will attain salvation.

805
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:18,000
Those touched by the true spirit will be saved while those ensnared by the false spirit will

806
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:25,280
face condemnation. Christ as an emissary for the higher realm reveals his mission to awaken and save

807
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:32,480
those trapped in Yelda Boeth's shadow, marking the enlightened, the special seal that protects

808
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:37,920
them from death. The Savior concludes with a warning, profiting from these divine secrets

809
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:44,800
would incur a curse. The Sethians, who produced this work, were a group of Christians that have

810
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:52,320
their roots in pre-Christian times before Jesus, among groups known as the Canites and Ophites,

811
01:39:52,960 --> 01:40:00,080
who existed in Syria, Palestine, and Armenia before coming to Alexandria, Egypt. They were

812
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:06,560
said to have became Christians after meeting Peter and Mark. Their predecessors, the Canites,

813
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:12,880
were a group of Jewish Gnostics who believed that the Old Testament God was evil and that Eve

814
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:20,400
was the Savior and that Cain was the hero because he tilled the land, was a vegetarian and did not

815
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:28,640
believe in blood sacrifice of animals to appease a demonic God. Along with the Ophites, they believed

816
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:35,920
the serpent in the garden was Sophia, wisdom incarnate who came to save the world with Gnosis.

817
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:42,960
They, along with the Sethians, taught that Christ on the cross was analogous to the serpent on the

818
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:50,320
cross that Moses placed in the desert to avert from harm. The serpent on the rod was a serpent

819
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:57,520
coiled on the tree in the garden and Christ on the cross was the fulfillment of this prophecy.

820
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:05,200
And as I stated before, the Gospel of John was a favorite among these groups, which also states,

821
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:11,440
Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,

822
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:19,520
John 3, 14. They also believed that Judas was a hero who was given the most important task

823
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:27,200
by Jesus to turn him in so he could become the sacrifice of the world. They produced the Gospel

824
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:34,560
of Judas, which explains how Jesus met secretly with Judas to tell him that he was the greatest

825
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:41,200
among the disciples, that he would be remembered by the world who has no Gnosis and that he would

826
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:44,800
be called the worst and that they would remove him from the Twelve.

827
01:41:53,440 --> 01:42:00,080
The Sethians employed a range of Middle Platonic, Zoroastrian metaphysics in their writings.

828
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:07,520
They also had a text attributed to the grandfather of Zoroaster, whose name is Zostrianos,

829
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:13,520
that explains the five levels of attaining salvation through five types of people,

830
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:21,600
which was revealed to him by the angel of Gnosis. The first type of person is materialistic with

831
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:29,120
a dead soul, mind, and body, and they suffer and are consumed by demons. The second type is

832
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:35,360
materialistic but has an immortal soul and they forget their eternal God and associate with

833
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:42,160
demons. The third type, the Sojourners, are far from wicked deeds if they possess an inward

834
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:49,040
discovery of truth. The fourth type is the one that repents, renounces dead things, and desires

835
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:55,920
immortal mind and soul, and they can receive another conception in every attainment. The fifth

836
01:42:55,920 --> 01:43:02,880
and most powerful type is the saved person who has grasped the image that changes in every situation

837
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:10,800
and can become divine. Zostrianos offers up praise to God and asks the angel of Gnosis for wisdom

838
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:17,440
about the dispersion of the saved type of person who is mixed with and divided from them.

839
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:25,600
The angel of Gnosis tells him, some souls need help to escape reincarnation and if not,

840
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:31,840
they will keep descending into generation and become speechless due to the clutches of the body.

841
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:39,600
To avoid this fate, there are specific powers appointed for salvation. These powers are perfect

842
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:46,400
living concepts that will save whoever receives them, passing through the world in every ion.

843
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:54,240
Additionally, the text describes the self-generated ions as eternal lights that possess a variety of

844
01:43:54,240 --> 01:44:01,680
beauty, trees, plants, human beings alive with every species, immortal souls, every shape and

845
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:08,480
species of intellect, gods of truth, angels dwelling in great glory with an indissoluble body,

846
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:16,880
and in generate offspring with unchangeable perception. These ions are perfect and individually

847
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:24,880
and at each ion there is a living earth, a living water, luminous air, and un-consuming fire.

848
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:32,000
Zostrianos explains that being baptized five times by the powers of the self-born

849
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:40,000
feignies caused him to become divine. Zostrianos urges the holy seed of Seth to awaken their divine

850
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:44,560
aspect, seek salvation by choosing the light over darkness.

851
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:56,960
The Sethians produced dozens of lengthy texts that were found among the Nag Hammadi courtesies

852
01:44:56,960 --> 01:45:03,200
in the sands of Egypt that were thought to have been lost for 15 centuries. It would take me an

853
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:09,920
entire video to go through them all. The Sethians would go on to influence the Nassians and Valentinians

854
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:15,680
and Marcionites. One of the main criticisms laid against them by Irenaeus and Hippolytus

855
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:21,760
is that they were dositis, which means they believed that Christ did not come in the flesh

856
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:29,200
but was just a phantom. This is however not true. One of the central Sethian texts called Melchizedek

857
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:36,800
contains an anti-dosetic message that advocates for a Christology wherein the incarnation of Jesus

858
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:45,760
was a flesh and blood human who was born, ate, drank, and suffered and died. The text also shows

859
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:52,400
close proximity to the author of Hebrews, highlighting that these Christian heretics

860
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:57,120
were more biblically based than what they were made out to be. This is not to say that dosicists

861
01:45:57,120 --> 01:46:02,320
did not exist and many of them certainly were on the Gnostic side, but this is not true for the

862
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:10,400
leading theologians described in this video. Even Origen was thought to hold some quasi-dositic views

863
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:16,080
on Christ's divinity. These Christian heretics were well connected in their time and well respected

864
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:29,200
by the masses. Marcion of Synope, who was deemed a heretic in the late 2nd century by Irenaeus,

865
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:36,560
was so influential and popular that he needs to be addressed before we discuss the Valentinians

866
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:45,280
and Nasines. Marcion claimed to have been taught by two teachers, Thutus, who traveled with Paul,

867
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:51,920
and Cerdo, who was a student of Simon Magus. It is thought that he met both of them through his

868
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:59,440
father, Philologus, who is one of the 70 disciples who actually met Jesus while he was alive.

869
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:06,800
Yes, you heard that right. Marcion's father, Philologus, is counted among the 70 disciples

870
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:13,040
from Luke, who physically met Jesus, and he was also the first bishop of Synope,

871
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:19,520
consecrated by Saint Andrew himself. Marcion's father, being one of the oldest saints to pass away,

872
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:28,320
makes Marcion the most interesting heretic of all. Marcion was also a close companion of

873
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:36,240
Valentinus and was welcomed to Rome under the papacy of hygienists in 138. His teacher, Cerdo,

874
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:42,320
taught that the god of the Old Testament was not the father of Jesus, but a different god,

875
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:49,440
and that the father of Jesus was the good god of justice who freed humanity from the

876
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:56,480
bondage of the law. Marcion seems to have adopted a similar view to this. Marcion posited that the

877
01:47:56,480 --> 01:48:02,880
deity depicted in the Hebrew scriptures, who he labeled the demi-urge and identified as the

878
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:10,160
architect of the physical cosmos, was a provincial god of the Jewish people, characterized by a strict

879
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:16,640
authoritarian legal system that inflicted suffering and death as a punishment for human

880
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:23,840
transgressions. On the other hand, the deity that Jesus manifested was a wholly separate entity,

881
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:31,840
a universal divinity defined by kindness and love, offering humanity forgiveness and grace.

882
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:39,760
Marcion is known to have composed a work known as the antithesis, which has been lost to time,

883
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:45,120
where he drew distinctions between the Old Testament's demi-urge and the New Testament's

884
01:48:45,120 --> 01:48:52,960
Heavenly Father. He showed how the Book of Kings depicts Elijah being called Baldi by some young

885
01:48:52,960 --> 01:49:00,400
children, and then the god sends she-bears to devour the children for revenge. He argued that

886
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:07,920
this is not the god of goodness and justice, but a vengeful deity who admits time and time again

887
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:13,120
that he is a jealous god, thirsty for blood sacrifice and burnt offerings.

888
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:18,000
God is not in need of anything and can never be jealous, according to Marcion.

889
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:28,080
The Gospel of John chapter 8 contains passages that can be seen as Marcionite. For example,

890
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:36,560
you judged by human standards. I pass judgment on no one, but if I do judge, my decisions are true

891
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:42,400
because I am not alone. I stand with the Father who sent me. In your law, it is written that the

892
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:48,560
testimony of two witnesses is true. I am the one who testifies for myself. My other witness is the

893
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:55,440
Father who sent me. You are from below. I am from above. You are of this world. I am not of this

894
01:49:55,440 --> 01:50:02,560
world. You are doing the works of your own Father. I know that you are Abraham's descendants,

895
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:09,200
yet you are looking for a way to kill me because you have no room for my word. I am telling you

896
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:15,200
what I have seen in the Father's presence and you are doing what you have heard from your Father.

897
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:20,720
Distinction there between his Father and their Father. If God were your Father,

898
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:27,280
you would love me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on my own. God sent me.

899
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:32,640
Why is my language not clear to you because you are unable to hear what I say?

900
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:39,440
You belong to your Father, the devil, and you want to carry out your Father's desires.

901
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:45,600
He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him.

902
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:53,120
When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the Father of lies.

903
01:50:54,080 --> 01:51:02,400
Jesus. You belong to your Father, the devil. It can be interpreted as that the Pharisees and

904
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:09,360
Sadducees are of a different Father than the one that Jesus was sent by, which is in line with

905
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:15,680
Marcy and I in Valentinian thinking. Marcyon is credited with being the first to establish a

906
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:21,600
collection of Christian scriptures. His compilation included just 11 texts,

907
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:29,520
partitioned in two categories, the Evangelicon, a condensed form of the Gospel according to Luke,

908
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:37,680
and the Apostolicon, a suite of 10 letters from Paul the Apostle, each slightly abbreviated in

909
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:44,240
comparison to the versions that would later become canon. Prominent early Christians like Irenaeus,

910
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:51,120
Tertolian, and Epiphanius mentioned that Marcyon deliberately modified Luke's Gospel and Paul's

911
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:57,040
letters to align with his own doctrinal stance, a view that Christian scholars used to support.

912
01:51:57,680 --> 01:52:04,560
However, a number of modern scholars suggest that Marcyon's renditions might actually predate the

913
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:09,840
versions that ultimately became part of the biblical canon and that it was the other church

914
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:17,360
fathers that altered these letters. Marcyon having the original correct version, Marcyon thrived in

915
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:23,920
Asia Minor, the location of the seven churches of Asia mentioned in Revelation. Pergamon,

916
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:29,680
one of the churches mentioned, was known in the first century to have a large Jewish community

917
01:52:29,680 --> 01:52:36,160
that strongly opposed Christianity. It is likely that Satan's throne and the synagogue of Satan

918
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:42,880
is a referencing to the Jews living in Pergamon in Asia Minor. I know your tribulation and your

919
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:49,360
poverty, but you are rich, and the slander of those who say that they are Jews and are not,

920
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:56,960
but are a synagogue of Satan. This throne of Satan is mentioned three times in Revelation

921
01:52:56,960 --> 01:53:03,760
and twice regarding people claiming to be Jews. This aligns with Marcyon's attitude that the

922
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:09,520
church is for the Gentiles and Jews who reject Judaism. Revelation ends with the marriage between

923
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:17,280
the bride of Christ represented by the church who accepts Jesus in condemnation for Israel who lost

924
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:25,120
the temple. Marcyon's preference for the Pauline letters is indicative of his belief that Paul alone

925
01:53:25,120 --> 01:53:30,960
was the true conveyor of Jesus' message as opposed to the twelve apostles and the early

926
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:37,360
Christian community based in Jerusalem who Marcyon believed were under the influence of the

927
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:43,520
demiurge. Marcyon's possession of Paul's epistles shows how close in proximity he was to Paul

928
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:50,400
and how connected he was. Remember, this wasn't a time when people can just fax an email content.

929
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:56,240
To have a copy of a letter so early on could only come from someone being in close connection to that

930
01:53:56,320 --> 01:54:05,200
person. And the fact that he had all of the authentic epistles of Paul so early on shows that

931
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:11,440
Marcyon was extremely connected. When Marcyon traveled to Rome in the 130s, he joined the

932
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:19,200
Roman church and made a large donation of 200,000 cestresses to the congregation there,

933
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:27,280
a modern equivalent to 2 million when $175,000 today. Conflicts with the Church of Rome arose.

934
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:33,360
He was eventually excommunicated in 144 when he was opposed by Pius and Anacetus,

935
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:40,080
but he was still popular in the Eastern churches long past his death into the third century.

936
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:45,680
2

937
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:51,120
Valentinus, his companion in Rome, also a follower of Thutus and Paul,

938
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:59,120
was up for Pontifus Maximus, the highest bishop in Rome, against Pius, and he lost by a small,

939
01:54:59,120 --> 01:55:05,120
narrow vote. Had he won that election, he would be on the list of popes inside your Catholic Bible,

940
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:11,600
and Marcyon would have never been excommunicated, and it is entirely possible that Christianity,

941
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:17,280
as we know it, would be completely different today. The bishop he lost to was the first to

942
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:25,360
oppose Marcyon, and considering how close he was to losing to Valentinus, it is entirely possible

943
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:32,080
that this created a division between them. He remained in Rome until the papacy of Anacetus,

944
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:37,280
but his movement declined after Marcyon was excommunicated. Thutilian writes,

945
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:43,680
Valentinus had expected to be a bishop, because he was an able man both ingenious and eloquent.

946
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:49,280
Being indignant, however, that another obtained the dignity by reason of claim which

947
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:54,560
confession had given him, he broke with the Church of the True Faith, just like those

948
01:55:54,560 --> 01:56:01,440
restless spirits which, when roused by ambition, are usually inflamed with the desire of revenge.

949
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:08,080
He applied himself with all his might to exterminate the truth, and finding the clue

950
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:14,160
of a certain old opinion, he marked out a path for himself with the subtlety of the serpent.

951
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:26,720
Valentinus said that Thutus imparted to him the secret wisdom that Paul had taught privately

952
01:56:26,720 --> 01:56:33,680
to his inner circle, which Paul publicly referred to in connection with his visionary encounter,

953
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:40,800
with the risen Christ, when he received the secret teaching from him. Such esoteric teachings were

954
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:46,960
downplayed in Rome after the middle of the second century, but these teachings of secret wisdom and

955
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:54,720
gnosis is something that comes up quite a bit in Paul's letters. Now to him who was able to establish

956
01:56:54,720 --> 01:57:00,640
you in accordance with my gospel, the message I proclaim about Jesus Christ in keeping with

957
01:57:00,640 --> 01:57:08,880
the revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past. We declare God's wisdom a mystery that has

958
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:18,880
been hidden and the God destined for our glory before time began. I know a man in Christ who 14

959
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:24,720
years ago was caught up in the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body,

960
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:32,160
I do not know, God knows. And I know that this man, whether in the body or apart from the body,

961
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:39,600
I do not know, but God knows, was caught up to paradise. And I heard inexpressible things

962
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:47,120
that no one is permitted to tell. One can argue that Paul himself attained apotheosis by reaching

963
01:57:47,120 --> 01:57:54,320
the third heaven. Elaine Pagels in her book, The Gnostic Paul, shows how the heretical teachings

964
01:57:54,320 --> 01:58:01,680
of the so-called Gnostics are just as aligned with Paul's letters as the so-called proto-orthodox

965
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:08,720
teachings are. In fact, one can even make the case that the Gnostics are even more aligned with Paul,

966
01:58:08,720 --> 01:58:15,520
especially the seven authentic Pauline epistles. More on this later. Valentinus was a neo-Pathagorean

967
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:23,920
Christian. Numerology and mysticism was at the core of his teachings. Hippolytus went as far as to

968
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:30,880
charge him with plagiarism of Pythagoras' teachings, in which he says, of some such nature as I who

969
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:37,120
have accurately examined their systems have attempted to state compenduously is the opinion

970
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:44,640
of Pythagoras and Plato. And from this system, not from the Gospels, Valentinus, as we have proved,

971
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:52,160
has collected the materials of heresy, I mean his own heresy, and may therefore justly be reckoned

972
01:58:52,160 --> 01:59:00,640
a Pythagorean and Platonus, not a Christian. Valentinus, therefore, and Heraclion and Ptolemaeus

973
01:59:00,640 --> 01:59:06,560
and the entire school of these heretics as disciples of Pythagoras and Plato following

974
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:13,680
these guides have laid down as a fundamental principle of their doctrine, the arithmetic system.

975
01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:22,800
The Valentinian system, like the Scythian, taught that the Godhead was a triad, God the Father,

976
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:30,800
Logos, and Zoe, again, drawn from the Gospel of John as shown earlier for the Scythian triad.

977
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:38,400
This triad system is arguably the origin itself of Trinitarian theology, which does not get accepted

978
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:44,800
as doctrine until the 4th century. The Valentinians already had this doctrine, and they held the

979
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:52,000
conviction that the existence initiated within an entity they termed the Pluroma, akin to the

980
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:58,720
universe. At its core was the original progenitor, Bithos, or the primal father, who epitomized

981
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:05,120
the inception of all entities. After ions of solitude and introspection, Bithos gave rise to

982
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:15,040
30 ions. Celestial ideals manifested as 15 duos of counterparts. Among these was the ion Sophia.

983
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:20,560
You might be wondering where this Sophia comes from, and is it biblically accurate? It is

984
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:26,240
biblically accurate, and it can be found in any Orthodox or Catholic Bible. In the book of Wisdom

985
02:00:26,240 --> 02:00:33,600
of Solomon, chapter 7 and 8, it says the following, I learned both what is secret and what is manifest

986
02:00:34,160 --> 02:00:40,240
for Sophia, the fashioner of all things, a spirit that is intelligent, holy, unique,

987
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:46,400
manifold, subtle, agile, clear, unpolluted, distinct, and vulnerable, loving the good,

988
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:53,520
keen, irresistible, beneficent, humane, steadfast, sure, free from anxiety, all powerful,

989
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:58,720
overseeing all, and penetrating through all spirits that are intelligent, pure, and all

990
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:05,120
together subtle. For Sophia is more mobile than any motion, because of her pureness,

991
02:01:05,120 --> 02:01:11,120
she pervades and penetrates all things. For she is a breath of the power of God,

992
02:01:11,120 --> 02:01:16,560
and a pure emanation of the glory of the Almighty. Therefore, nothing defiled gains

993
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:23,280
entrance into her. She is a reflection of the eternal light, a spotless mirror of the working of

994
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:29,760
God and an image of his goodness. Although she is but one, she can do all things, and while

995
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:37,280
remaining in herself, she renews all things. In every generation, she passes into holy souls

996
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:43,600
and makes them friends of God and prophets. For God loves nothing so much as the person who loves

997
02:01:43,600 --> 02:01:49,760
Sophia. The wisdom of Solomon also depicts Sophia as being in the beginning with creation,

998
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:57,200
forming Adam himself. Sophia's flaws, her curiosity, and fervor precipitated her descent

999
02:01:57,200 --> 02:02:04,480
from the Pluroma, culminating in the emergence of earthly realm and humanity. Both intrinsically

1000
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:11,200
imperfect, the deity of the Hebrew scriptures was equated by the Valentinians with the Demi-erj,

1001
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:17,200
an inferior artisan responsible for crafting the physical cosmos. Humanity esteemed as the

1002
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:24,080
pinnacle of creation in this corporal world as an amalgamation of spirit and matter. Redemption's

1003
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:31,200
objective is to extricate the spiritual essence from its maternal entanglements. It was imperative,

1004
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:37,440
according to Valentinian thought, to acknowledge the primal father as the fountainhead of divine

1005
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:44,400
essence in the quest for gnosis or profound spiritual enlightenment. They believe that an

1006
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:51,120
individual's acquisition of this deep-seated knowledge or gnosis bore beneficial repercussions

1007
02:02:51,120 --> 02:02:56,080
for the cosmos at large, aiding in the restoration of cosmic harmony.

1008
02:03:00,160 --> 02:03:07,200
The Valentinians posited that salvation was rooted in gnosis, not mere faith. Clement noted

1009
02:03:07,200 --> 02:03:13,440
that Valentinians considered Orthodox Christians to be naively faithful, whereas they themselves

1010
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:19,920
were the bearers of gnosis. They viewed themselves as intrinsically redeemed by a virtue of innate

1011
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:26,000
superior seed within them, positioning their spiritual gnosis as distinct from the faith

1012
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:31,520
from the ordinary believer, as the ethereal is from the tangible. Valentinians' system

1013
02:03:31,520 --> 02:03:38,400
stresses the idea of not being a scholar of the law, but of being spiritually rich within.

1014
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:42,320
One might be reminded of Jesus in the Gospel of Luke here.

1015
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:51,520
Woe to you scholars of the law who have taken away the key of gnosis. You yourselves did not enter

1016
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:57,440
and you stopped those trying to enter. The Valentinian idea of putting gnosis over faith

1017
02:03:57,440 --> 02:04:02,800
and the spirit over the law is something that Jesus himself preached in his time,

1018
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:08,720
according to the Gospels. Jesus is portrayed in the Gospels with an attitude that shows

1019
02:04:08,720 --> 02:04:15,760
stoic and cynic leadings, and his parables align with middle Platonists and Pythagorean values.

1020
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:22,080
These Valentinians, like the Orphic and Pythagoreans before them, held to the doctrines of transmigrations

1021
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:28,240
of the soul, which is a lot like Vedic reincarnation. One might easily dismiss this as heresy,

1022
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:35,440
however, the Gospel of Matthew declares that John the Baptist is the second coming of Elijah,

1023
02:04:35,440 --> 02:04:42,160
which could very easily be interpreted as transmigration, just as Jesus is the last Adam.

1024
02:04:42,160 --> 02:04:48,960
If John the Baptist is not literally Elijah, then the prophecy is failed and the Messiah never came.

1025
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:52,880
I don't think Christians would say that, right? So you kind of have to say,

1026
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:56,800
transmigration doctrine is valid under Christianity.

1027
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:10,400
Valentinus had a student named Marcus Magus, who started his own sect, known as the Marcosians.

1028
02:05:11,200 --> 02:05:17,520
Although heretics now, they are credited greatly for helping spread Christianity

1029
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:24,320
into France and Europe. His system was completely Pythagorean. His system tells of 30 ions,

1030
02:05:24,320 --> 02:05:31,200
divided into an Agduod, a Dekad, and a Dodecad. Of the fall and recovery of Sophia,

1031
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:38,320
of the future union of the spirits of the chosen seed with angels as their heavenly bridegrooms.

1032
02:05:38,320 --> 02:05:44,960
Something that we just looked at from the Solomon wisdom text, which is also canon,

1033
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:50,240
according to both Catholic and Orthodoxy. What Marcus added to the teaching of his predecessors

1034
02:05:50,240 --> 02:05:57,760
was a system of isopathy, similar to that of the later Pythagoreans about mysteries and numbers

1035
02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:04,080
and names. Marcus found in scripture and in nature repeated examples of the occurrence of his mystical

1036
02:06:04,080 --> 02:06:13,280
numbers 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 30. Marcus Magus points out that the gematria of the name

1037
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:21,920
Jesus or Jesus in Greek totals 888, a perfect number that shows God's divine providence as the

1038
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:30,240
logos, due to the Greek alphabet having exactly eight monads, eight decades, and eight hectonads.

1039
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:37,920
That is that Jesus consists of all numbers in the alphabet and is thus the logos 888. It is said

1040
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:45,440
by Hippolytus that Marcus Magus was delivering Eucharist with purple fluids in the wine that

1041
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:52,320
contained a hallucinogenic drug that would cause his initiates to experience intense visions

1042
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:57,280
that he would call the Holy Spirit. He even said that Marcus would have two cups ready,

1043
02:06:57,280 --> 02:07:03,520
one for the people to check beforehand and one with a sleight of hand would swap it out with

1044
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:09,600
the drugged one and at the last second people would think that the Holy Spirit was taking them over

1045
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:16,720
and giving them visions when he really drugs them. If this true or not, we can never know. But Marcus

1046
02:07:16,720 --> 02:07:24,720
Magus' trinity has a father, a mother, and a son, similar to the concepts in Wisdoms of Solomon,

1047
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:31,360
Sophia, God, Messiah, and the Marcosians would thrive in France all the way to the fourth century

1048
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:35,200
until they mostly were swallowed up by the Arians and Cathars.

1049
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:46,960
Before I bring in the so-called proto-Orthodox fathers like Clement and Papius and Ignatius

1050
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:53,040
and Polycarb, I want to talk about my favorite heretic of all. He is called the Nasin preacher.

1051
02:07:55,520 --> 02:08:00,720
The Nasin preacher, who led the Nasins, a group of charismatic,

1052
02:08:00,720 --> 02:08:07,360
fringian Christians who venerated the great mother. They are the first group that Hippolytus

1053
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:13,840
discusses in his against heresies. These Nasins have doctrines that align closely

1054
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:20,880
to that which is found within the sibling oracles and Greek magical papyri, a wide-ranging mixture

1055
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:27,040
of pagan Jewish, Greek mystery cults, Platonic philosophy, and Dionysian revelry.

1056
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:35,520
They represent Adam as Adamus, an androgynous dyad of both male and female, and equate him with

1057
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:42,000
the Adamus from the Semithracian Mysteries, as well as Addis from the Phrygian Mysteries.

1058
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:50,240
The name Nasin, which means people of the snake, is attributed to both the rod of Asclepius and the

1059
02:08:50,240 --> 02:08:55,920
staff of Moses. They believe, like the Ophites and Canites, that Christ on the cross was the

1060
02:08:55,920 --> 02:09:01,280
fulfillment of the serpent on the rod in the wilderness of Zion. And this, of course, is

1061
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:07,120
presented by the Gospel of John. And like Pliny the Younger's Christians, they also sing hymns to

1062
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:14,560
Christ at dawn, who they call Lucifer, just as Christ is called Lucifer or Morning Star

1063
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:22,560
in the Book of Revelation. I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify to you about these things for

1064
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:30,240
the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the Bright Morning Star, Revelation 22.

1065
02:09:30,240 --> 02:09:36,080
Furthermore, the Gospel of the Egyptians is central to them. They affirm that Venus and

1066
02:09:36,080 --> 02:09:43,680
Proserpina, both in love with Adonis, represent the natural world of production and regeneration.

1067
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:51,520
But when Diana Selina passes over to Eclipse, then Adonis becomes Addis castrated. This represents

1068
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:58,400
the threefold nature of Christ, who is neither male nor female, connected by his death, resurrection,

1069
02:09:58,400 --> 02:10:05,440
and apotheosis. Christ, they say, in all that have been generated, is portrayed Son of Man

1070
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:10,560
from the unportrable Logos, which is the meaning of the great and unspeakable

1071
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:19,280
Ellusinian mysteries of Dionysus and Demeter. They say that Christ is Mercury, the Logos of Zeus,

1072
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:27,200
waving his wand, which guides souls out of Hades and into heaven. The Nassian preacher says to the

1073
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:36,000
adepts, And as when in the magic caves recess, bats humming fly, and when one drops from ridge of

1074
02:10:36,080 --> 02:10:42,640
rock, and each to other things clings, I place a rock at the foundations of Zion.

1075
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:52,400
This rock, he affirms, is Adam. The Nassian hymn was an ancient Orphic hymn to Addis,

1076
02:10:53,440 --> 02:10:59,360
repurposed for Jesus Christ by the Nassian preacher. And it goes like this,

1077
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:07,200
Whether you are a child of Kronos, or their happy son of Zeus, or Rea, welcome O great one,

1078
02:11:07,200 --> 02:11:14,480
who is the sad song of Christ. The Assyrians call you thrice-desired Adonis, and all Egypt calls

1079
02:11:14,480 --> 02:11:21,920
you Osiris. Greek wisdom calls you the heavenly horn of the crescent moon. The Semithracians

1080
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:28,960
call you veneral Adamus. The Ammonians call you Coribos, and the Phrygians sometimes call you

1081
02:11:29,040 --> 02:11:36,640
Papa. And at times they call you the dead one, or the god, or the barren one, or the goat herd,

1082
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:44,080
or the harvested unripe ear of corn, or their fruitful one, who the almond tree begot. The man

1083
02:11:44,080 --> 02:11:52,000
who plays the pipe, the hymn continues in another verse, I will hymn Addis, son of Rea, not with

1084
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:59,120
buzzing sound of trumpets, or idean pipers, with the accord of the voices of the curates,

1085
02:11:59,120 --> 02:12:07,440
but I will mingle my song with the polo's music of harps. Evo, hallelujah, in so much as thou art

1086
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:15,120
pan, as thou art bacchus, as thou art the shepherd of brilliant stars. But Jesus said, Father, behold,

1087
02:12:15,200 --> 02:12:22,160
a strife of ills across the earth wanders from the breath of wrath, but bitter chaos

1088
02:12:22,160 --> 02:12:29,040
seeks to shun, and knows not how to pass it through. On this account, O Father, send me,

1089
02:12:29,600 --> 02:12:37,600
bearing seals I shall descend through ions, whole I'll sweep, all mysteries I'll unravel,

1090
02:12:37,600 --> 02:12:44,640
and forms of gods I'll show, and secrets of the saintly path, style gnosis, all in part.

1091
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:59,360
Most of this sounds like a completely different religion than Orthodox Christianity of today,

1092
02:12:59,360 --> 02:13:05,840
but what do the earliest Christians, who the Orthodox and Catholics venerate as saints say?

1093
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:12,240
The oldest text that we have, outside of Paul's epistles in biblical letters, is the Epistle

1094
02:13:12,240 --> 02:13:19,600
of Clement, the only surviving text in the first century that exists outside of the biblical canon

1095
02:13:19,600 --> 02:13:27,200
is Clement's epistle to the Corinthians. Clement lived from 35 to 99 AD, and he is so important,

1096
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:34,240
he is considered one of the first popes, consecrated by Peter himself, and one of the first saints.

1097
02:13:34,240 --> 02:13:39,200
He is considered to be the first apostolic father of the church,

1098
02:13:39,920 --> 02:13:48,320
one of the three chief ones together, with Polycarp and Ignatius, and a co-laborer of Paul.

1099
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:55,760
His epistle to the Corinthians shows no signs of any concern with the Gnostic heresy. He is mostly

1100
02:13:55,760 --> 02:14:02,320
concerned with the belief in the resurrection, and spiritual principles such as humility,

1101
02:14:02,320 --> 02:14:09,520
hospitality, and piety. He reminds the Corinthians that Christ belongs to the lowly of heart,

1102
02:14:09,520 --> 02:14:12,960
and not to anyone who would exalt themselves above the flock.

1103
02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:20,160
For Clement, there are no grounds for doubting the resurrection, and says that faith must be

1104
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:28,800
accompanied by works. He shows much more concern for unity than for division and calling out heresy.

1105
02:14:29,440 --> 02:14:36,080
Clement, however, tells a story that is nowhere to be found in any Orthodox doctrines.

1106
02:14:36,080 --> 02:14:43,280
In verse 25, Clement talks about a portent that occurs in the east, in Arabia, where there is a

1107
02:14:43,280 --> 02:14:50,880
bird known as a phoenix, which has a lifespan of a thousand years, 500 years alive, which upon death

1108
02:14:51,440 --> 02:14:58,720
makes a nest out of frankincense and myrrh, and dies, and its decaying flesh becomes a

1109
02:14:58,720 --> 02:15:07,360
small grub, for 500 years, and after reaching full growth, takes up the nest, containing the bones

1110
02:15:07,360 --> 02:15:15,360
of its predecessor, and carries them all the way from Arabia to Heliopolis, rising into the sky

1111
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:23,840
resurrected. It flies to the altar of Helios in Egypt, deposits them to the priest of Heliopolis,

1112
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:29,760
and when the priests consult their records, they see that it arrived on the 500th year,

1113
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:34,880
fulfilling the 1000 year cycle of death and resurrection of the phoenix.

1114
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:41,760
Clement argues that this miracle was given by God as a symbol of death and resurrection of Christ.

1115
02:15:42,480 --> 02:15:50,400
He does not ever say that this is a myth or legend, but describes this as a real natural event that

1116
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:58,800
happens. This is also found in Greek mythology before Christianity, and it turns out that among

1117
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:03,920
the Nag Hammadi scriptures, within the texts known as the On the Origin of the World,

1118
02:16:04,640 --> 02:16:11,600
once again a text central to Valentinians and Sethians, and in this text we find the same

1119
02:16:11,600 --> 02:16:18,240
legend of an Arabian phoenix who has a lifespan of 1000 years and travels to Heliopolis.

1120
02:16:19,040 --> 02:16:24,800
This shows that Clement has a lot more in common with these so-called heretics and

1121
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:26,640
gnostics than people think.

1122
02:16:31,920 --> 02:16:38,640
Ignatius of Antioch is sketch. Records can't even get his birth or death when he died within 40

1123
02:16:38,640 --> 02:16:44,800
years. Eusebius claims he died in 108, but the sources suggest that he lived much later and

1124
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:51,600
died around 140. Most of the stories about him and his margaretum seem to be fabricated legends.

1125
02:16:51,600 --> 02:16:56,640
Of his epistles, many seem to be later forgeries, but some might be authentic.

1126
02:16:57,360 --> 02:17:02,640
There are some scholars who even doubt the so-called authentic ones as well.

1127
02:17:03,440 --> 02:17:09,360
But to be charitable, he seems to be concerned with the nature of Christ's divinity. There is one

1128
02:17:09,360 --> 02:17:16,640
physician who has possessed both flesh and spirit, both made and not made. God existing in flesh,

1129
02:17:16,640 --> 02:17:22,000
true life and death, both Mary and of God. First passable and then impassable,

1130
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:26,160
even Jesus Christ our Lord. Ignatius. Letter to the Ephesians.

1131
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:32,160
There are some Christian scholars who claim that Ignatius was an early opponent in Gnosticism.

1132
02:17:32,720 --> 02:17:38,160
However, the way they argue this is flawed. Ignatius only seems to be concerned with

1133
02:17:38,160 --> 02:17:44,480
dositis, and Christian scholars as well as some of the heresiologists tend to lump the

1134
02:17:44,560 --> 02:17:51,680
dositis in with the Gnostics, so then they can claim that any opposition to dositism

1135
02:17:51,680 --> 02:17:59,280
is also somehow an opposition to Gnosticism. But Ignatius aligns with Marcyon and Valentinus

1136
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:06,160
in the sense that they all agree that Judaism and the Mosaic Law is not important for salvation.

1137
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:10,240
Polycarp

1138
02:18:10,240 --> 02:18:18,320
Polycarp lived from 69 to 155 and was a disciple of John and the first bishop of Smyrna.

1139
02:18:19,120 --> 02:18:25,520
His epistle to the Philippians is dated to 108 during the reign of Trajan. Most of what is

1140
02:18:25,520 --> 02:18:32,480
contained in his epistle regards to conduct of members of the church. Stand fast therefore

1141
02:18:32,480 --> 02:18:38,240
in these things and follow the example of the Lord, being firm and unchangeable in faith,

1142
02:18:38,240 --> 02:18:43,280
loving the brotherhood, and being attached to one another. Join together in the truth,

1143
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:49,760
exhibiting the meekness of the Lord in your inner course with one another and despising no one,

1144
02:18:49,760 --> 02:18:56,240
Polycarp. He also stresses the importance for women in the church, both wives and widows,

1145
02:18:56,320 --> 02:19:03,200
who he says, knowing that they are an altar of God. This inclusion of women in the church

1146
02:19:03,200 --> 02:19:09,280
is something that aligns once again with the Valentinians and Marcyonites and less

1147
02:19:09,280 --> 02:19:15,600
with the orthodoxy of the 4th century church, which became strictly patriarchal in its structure.

1148
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:28,320
Lastly, Papias of Heropolis, who lived from 60 to 130 A.D. Most of what Papias writes about

1149
02:19:28,320 --> 02:19:34,160
is concerning the reliability of the gospel accounts and does not ever say anything about

1150
02:19:34,160 --> 02:19:40,400
a Gnostic heresy. He tells us that Peter told Mark about the sayings of Jesus,

1151
02:19:40,480 --> 02:19:46,160
Mark put them into a narrative and then Matthew came along and rewrote Mark in the correct order,

1152
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:51,920
but he says that Matthew wrote Hebrew, which is clearly false. Even Eusebius criticizes the

1153
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:58,000
reliability of Papias and calls him dumb for taking things that are allegorical to literal.

1154
02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:07,600
Justin Martyr, who lived from 100 to 160, is the beginning of the schism between the Gnostics

1155
02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:14,080
and the so-called proto-orthodoxy. Justin Martyr opposes Marcyon in the year 144,

1156
02:20:14,080 --> 02:20:20,240
and thus begins the first great schism of the church. However, even in Justin's writings,

1157
02:20:20,800 --> 02:20:25,520
he writes things that align heavily with the Carpocretian and Simonian thought.

1158
02:20:26,480 --> 02:20:34,240
Justin declared that Socrates and Heraclitus were Christians. His aim was to emphasize

1159
02:20:34,240 --> 02:20:40,320
that absolute significance of Christ so that all that ever existed of virtue and truth

1160
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:45,920
may be referred to him. This is something that the heretics mentioned in this video

1161
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:52,400
and also believed in. The old philosophers and law givers had only a part of the logos

1162
02:20:52,400 --> 02:20:58,000
while the whole appears in Christ. Christ marks the end of regulations of circumcision,

1163
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:05,760
animal sacrifices, the Sabbath, and the laws as to food. Though Christ, the abiding law of God has

1164
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:11,440
been fully proclaimed, in his character as the teacher of the new doctrine and promulgator of

1165
02:21:11,440 --> 02:21:18,960
new law, lies the essential nature of his redeeming work. Justin Martyr admits in his own writing

1166
02:21:18,960 --> 02:21:25,440
that he went to Athens Academy to be educated as a Pythagorean, but was not able to learn music,

1167
02:21:25,440 --> 02:21:31,760
math, and geometry. He then attended a peripatetic philosopher, but was put off, but the philosopher

1168
02:21:31,760 --> 02:21:37,440
was too eager for his fee. When he tried to become a Stoic, he was not satisfied with their ideas

1169
02:21:37,440 --> 02:21:45,120
about God, so he adopted Platonism. And the perception of immaterial things quite overpowered me.

1170
02:21:45,120 --> 02:21:51,440
And the contemplation of ideas furnished my mind with wings so that in a little while, I suppose,

1171
02:21:51,440 --> 02:21:59,840
that I had become wise, and such was my stupidity. I expected forthwith to look upon God, for this

1172
02:21:59,840 --> 02:22:07,360
is the end of Plato's philosophy. Sometime later, Justin met a Syrian Christian ascetic living in

1173
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:15,040
poverty and said that he debated him about God and was converted due to being moved by the man's arguments.

1174
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:27,360
So what can we conclude from all this? Irenaeus claims that the secret gnosis passed down by the

1175
02:22:27,360 --> 02:22:34,080
few who have the Holy Spirit is heretical, but says that only bishops can have true authority,

1176
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:40,960
and are thus human representatives of God on earth. The faith preached to men, which comes down to

1177
02:22:40,960 --> 02:22:47,920
our time by means of the successions of the bishops, for it is a matter of necessity that

1178
02:22:47,920 --> 02:22:55,040
every church should agree with this church on account of its preeminent authority.

1179
02:22:55,040 --> 02:23:02,160
This view, in my opinion, is completely elitist, and it is at odds with the central teachings

1180
02:23:02,160 --> 02:23:10,080
of Christ who says, whoever has ears to hear, let them hear. For all those who exalt themselves

1181
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:15,120
will be humbled, and those who humbled themselves will be exalted. Matthew 20.

1182
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:23,040
So the last will be first, and the first will be last. Mark 4. If anyone has ears to hear,

1183
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:28,880
let them hear. Matthew 22. When he was alone, the twelve and the others around him asked him

1184
02:23:28,880 --> 02:23:34,640
about the parables. He told them, the secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you,

1185
02:23:34,640 --> 02:23:40,240
but to those on the outside, everything is said in parables so that they may be ever seen,

1186
02:23:40,880 --> 02:23:48,160
but never perceiving, and ever hearing, but never understanding. Otherwise, they might turn and

1187
02:23:48,160 --> 02:23:55,760
be forgiven. Luke 14. For many are called, but few are chosen. All throughout the Gospels, Jesus

1188
02:23:55,760 --> 02:24:02,320
is preaching about secret wisdom and rejecting authority figures. The system of bishops getting

1189
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:09,200
authority from other bishops is exactly the system of the Pharisees and Sadducees that Jesus

1190
02:24:09,200 --> 02:24:18,000
rejected. Even Paul in his epistle to the Corinthian says, If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels,

1191
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:26,720
but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clinging symbol. If I have the gift of prophecy

1192
02:24:26,720 --> 02:24:32,960
and can fathom all mysteries and gnosis, and if I have a faith that can move mountains,

1193
02:24:32,960 --> 02:24:40,160
but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body at

1194
02:24:40,160 --> 02:24:49,200
a hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing. 1 Corinthians 13. 1 might think

1195
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:55,200
Paul is talking negatively about speaking in tongues and having gnosis. However, if you read

1196
02:24:55,200 --> 02:25:02,880
this carefully, he places tongues and mysteries and gnosis above faith. And then he says that all

1197
02:25:02,880 --> 02:25:11,200
three of those levels of salvation are nothing without love. Gnosis, faith, and the Holy Spirit,

1198
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:18,240
all being nothing without love. Paul is relating that those three are the gifts of the Holy Spirit,

1199
02:25:18,240 --> 02:25:22,880
talking about them in a positive light. Later in the epistle, Paul drives this home,

1200
02:25:22,880 --> 02:25:29,520
follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit, especially prophecy. For anyone who

1201
02:25:29,520 --> 02:25:36,160
speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God. Indeed, no one understands them,

1202
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:41,760
they utter mysteries by the Spirit. But the one who prophesies speaks to people further

1203
02:25:41,760 --> 02:25:48,560
strengthening, encouraging, and comfort. Anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves,

1204
02:25:48,640 --> 02:25:55,840
but the one who prophesies edifies the church. I would like every one of you to speak in tongues,

1205
02:25:55,840 --> 02:26:01,440
but I would rather you prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks

1206
02:26:01,440 --> 02:26:08,720
in tongues unless someone interprets so that the church may be edified. Now, brothers and sisters,

1207
02:26:08,720 --> 02:26:15,040
if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you unless I bring you some revelation

1208
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:22,720
or a gnosis or prophecy or a word of instruction? Paul is speaking the language of the mystic Gnostic,

1209
02:26:22,720 --> 02:26:28,800
one who interprets prophecy is the one with the gnosis, and the Gnostics and Heretics all had

1210
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:35,280
this in common. They all entered into ecstatic states and spoke in tongues. Without gnosis,

1211
02:26:35,280 --> 02:26:43,600
however, how can one interpret prophecy? Justin Martyr opposed Marcian in 144 and led to the schism

1212
02:26:43,600 --> 02:26:47,440
between the Gnostics and Orthodoxy in the middle of the second century.

1213
02:26:52,160 --> 02:26:58,800
The church would go on to be led by the likes of Origen, Tertullian, Irenaeus, Hippolytus, Julius

1214
02:26:58,800 --> 02:27:05,680
Africanus, Cyril, Augustine, and Clement of Alexandria, and those names are usually listed as

1215
02:27:05,680 --> 02:27:10,080
the first generation of Christians, even though they're kind of like the third generation of

1216
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:17,440
Christians. The Gnostic did not go extinct, however. A charismatic Gnostic named Peter

1217
02:27:17,440 --> 02:27:23,440
would start a sect of Christians known as the Eukites, and they spread throughout Mesopotamia

1218
02:27:23,440 --> 02:27:29,120
and Asia Minor. They would influence the Bogomiles and Cathars, who would survive in Europe

1219
02:27:29,120 --> 02:27:34,000
during the Middle Ages and be heavily persecuted by the Orthodox Catholic Church.

1220
02:27:34,960 --> 02:27:41,120
They believed that they were returning to the true spiritual wisdom of Christ and rejected

1221
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:49,120
bishop authority as in modern day Pharisees. They were accused by Eusebius of engaging into

1222
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:57,280
Orgiastic rituals. A prophet would rise up named Manny in the third century, who declared himself

1223
02:27:57,280 --> 02:28:03,760
to be an apostle of Jesus Christ, and would be revered from Europe all the way to China,

1224
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:11,280
and he would start a new religion known as Manichaeism, which would incorporate the teachings of Buddha,

1225
02:28:11,280 --> 02:28:17,280
Zoroastrian, Jesus, and Krishna, all considered to be prophets alongside Manny. This religion would

1226
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:24,720
thrive in India and China, as well as Arabia and Persia. This religion mixes ideas from the Magi,

1227
02:28:24,720 --> 02:28:30,640
the Brahmins, and Judeo-Christian prophets. Even Augustine temporarily was a convert.

1228
02:28:31,600 --> 02:28:37,440
This religion would even influence early Islam. When Theodosius became the emperor

1229
02:28:37,440 --> 02:28:43,680
in the late fourth century, he issued a decree of the death for all Manichaean monks living in

1230
02:28:43,680 --> 02:28:50,640
the Roman Empire, and declared Orthodox Christianity the only legitimate and legal religion for the

1231
02:28:50,640 --> 02:29:02,000
Roman Empire. The fact that the Christian persecution by Orthodox Christians against

1232
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:07,200
Gnostics and Manichaeans is rich in irony. The real martyrs for Jesus turned out to be the

1233
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:14,160
heretics, just as Jesus was considered a heretic, and the scribal authority class having dominance

1234
02:29:14,160 --> 02:29:20,800
over the aesthetic spiritual Christians living in poverty, just as the scribes and Pharisees in

1235
02:29:20,800 --> 02:29:28,640
the time of Jesus is completely antithetical to the message of Jesus, who opposed the scribes and

1236
02:29:28,640 --> 02:29:35,280
Pharisees for their ever obsession with the law and searching the scriptures for authority.

1237
02:29:35,840 --> 02:29:41,040
You search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life, and these are they

1238
02:29:41,040 --> 02:29:47,920
which testify of me, but you are not willing to come to me that you may have life, John 5.

1239
02:29:54,880 --> 02:30:00,080
And so, with all that being said, I want to conclude with this. Do I think the Gnostics and

1240
02:30:00,080 --> 02:30:05,600
those who are deemed heretics are right, and the heresiologists, or so-called orthodoxy,

1241
02:30:05,600 --> 02:30:11,440
like Irenaeus and Hippolytus, are wrong? Not necessarily. I don't think the answer to this

1242
02:30:11,440 --> 02:30:17,200
question is so black and white, but I do think that if there's anything I demonstrated in this

1243
02:30:17,200 --> 02:30:23,200
video is that there is much more nuance here regarding whichever these doctrines should be

1244
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:30,000
considered correct or heretical. Are we basing this off Jesus' teachings, Paul, or what your

1245
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:35,440
pastor or priest told you last Sunday? Let me know what you guys think in the comments, and you have

1246
02:30:35,440 --> 02:30:38,880
ascertained Trunosis.
