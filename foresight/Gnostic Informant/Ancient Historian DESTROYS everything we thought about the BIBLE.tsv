0	7000	We're researching this, it's always about lifting the hood and looking what is the reality on the ground.
7000	15000	I'll say something that might shock a lot of people, but basically in the Persian period, we have thousands of documents from
15000	21000	Yahwistic slash Jewish sources. So when I look at all of this data, all of it together,
21000	28000	there is literally zero evidence for any knowledge and any familiarity with the Bible throughout the entire period.
28000	39000	Historically, it is so clear and so conspicuous that up until the library was established late tail end of the 4th century,
39000	48000	beginning of the 3rd century BC in Alexandria, up until that moment, we see zero evidence of any type of knowledge of the Bible
48000	55000	anywhere in any of the Jewish diaspora, whether in Egypt, Babylonia, Judea, Samaria, etc.
55000	62000	This changes at the beginning of the 3rd century so clearly, we start seeing those names appearing in the Cateus of Abdera,
62000	68000	or whatever text that we have there, people start knowing something about the Bible, referring to the Bible.
68000	73000	But you see elements like that, you see Anat Yahu, the goddess Anat Yahu.
73000	82000	It says that they brought an offering to Yahweh, and the line under that says that one Atrodan, that they had an Atrodan there.
82000	90000	Now Atrodan today in Zoroastrianism is an Atashtan, but that is the fire holder of Zoroastrian cult.
90000	95000	So in their temple, in the Yahweh's temple, they had a fire holder.
95000	97000	Is that an Avestan term that you just used?
97000	99000	Yeah, it's an Avestan term.
99000	101000	That's not a Semitic thing, that's an Avestan thing.
101000	103000	Absolutely, absolutely.
103000	110000	There were major people who were called Maghush, and one of them was Moses.
110000	116000	You know, how Moses was an Alchemist, you know, to make nature do what he wanted.
116000	120000	But also that Moses was the teacher of Orpheus.
120000	135000	My special guest today, Professor Gad Barneya, who is a lecturer at the Department of Jewish History
135000	142000	and Biblical Studies at the University of Haifa, as well as a research fellow at the Bible in its traditions.
142000	147000	A research project and flagship in the field of digital humanities.
147000	155000	Barneya's scholarly focus is directed at researching and teaching the evolution and character of Yahwism
155000	163000	under the Iranian Age of Empires, from the rise of the Achaemenidid Empire to the fall Sasanian Empire.
163000	171000	Specifically in the realm of cultic practices, Barneya's scholarship examines the dialogue and symbiosis
171000	176000	of early Zoroastrianism and Yahwism or early Judaism.
176000	183000	The Iranian Age of Empires was instrumental as the historical and ideological background
183000	192000	for the composition, addition, and redaction of the Hebrew Bible, which took place in the Hellenistic period.
192000	197000	Yes, you heard that right, according to Dr. Barneya.
197000	205000	The Bible that we have in our possession is a product of the Hellenistic period at the Library of Alexandria,
205000	214000	which produced the Bible, the apocryphal text, early Christianity, and the so-called Gnostic writings,
214000	218000	as well as rabbinic and early mystical Judaism.
218000	224000	We're going to talk about all that in this video. Buckle your seatbelts because you're going to want to strap in for this one.
224000	230000	And welcome back to the Gnostic Enformment, and you are about to attain true gnosis.
230000	234000	And today I'm joined with Professor Gad Barneya all the way out.
234000	238000	You're over in Israel right now, if I'm not mistaken, right? And hi for university.
238000	247000	And yeah, your work is really fascinating because things that I've stumbled on in the couple years that I've been doing this channel
247000	250000	and talking to experts in the field like yourself.
250000	256000	One of the things is the question of what was going on in these different temple periods.
256000	260000	We call it the first temple period built supposedly by Solomon.
260000	264000	And there's a second temple period supposedly when they come back from Babylon.
264000	270000	And you have a book coming out that a lot of people are really waiting for, me and myself.
270000	275000	Link's going to be in the description where it's coming out in a couple of months.
275000	277000	Is that so? A couple of months?
277000	281000	It's slated to come out on November 4th.
281000	283000	Yes. Okay. So only a few months away.
283000	292000	And I'm telling all my followers, get this book because it's going to shake some things up in this discussion.
292000	300000	And the topic of this book is what was Yawism like under the Achaemenid period, the Persian period?
300000	312000	And so what are some of the misconceptions that people think about this time period and what was going on with and also why do we call it Yawism and not Judaism?
312000	316000	Great. So two great points, great questions.
316000	320000	So the first, I'll start with talking a little bit about Yawism.
320000	326000	Yawism is a cult.
326000	332000	I mean, speaking of religion for that period, I mean, the word religion doesn't really apply to that early period.
332000	339000	By religion, I mean a system of rules to follow, observances and things like that.
339000	341000	So I use the term cult.
342000	355000	So Yawism is a cultic system where the main, the head of the pantheon, the main deity is, but not the only one, is Yahweh or Yahu as they wrote it.
355000	370000	And so that is really the simplest definition is simply people who adhere as their main ethnic deity to the deity known as Yaw or Yahweh.
370000	377000	That's really the simplest definition and it's a pretty good definition because there wasn't really a lot more to it at the time.
377000	383000	I'm putting the biblical image of that period aside from now.
383000	388000	I'm talking purely from a historical perspective or archaeological perspective and things like that.
388000	397000	And so the Yawism at the time was simply people who had their main ethnic deity.
397000	409000	But I'm stressing that the main deity, not the exclusive deity, main deity Yahweh, but they certainly believed in other deities as well.
409000	420000	And in local deities and imperial deities and things like that, they certainly believe that these other powers, supernatural powers have power over their own lives.
420000	437000	And so Yawism is really just a form of cultic adherence to the deity known as Yaw, but with no specific observances and things like that.
437000	449000	Now what's interesting, many scholars and certainly many lay people who are interested believe that Yawism morphed into Judaism later on, became more specialized,
449000	458000	became adopted the features that we now associate with Judaism.
458000	460000	And that's not the case.
460000	471000	Yawism kind of spawned Judaism off, okay, and by extension also Christianity and other Samaritanism and things like that.
471000	478000	But Yawism continued full force, at least until the fall of the Roman Empire.
478000	496000	So in fact, what is absolutely fascinating, and it's another book I'm working on, is that if we were to travel back in time, 2,000 years or even less, you know, 1,700 years or so,
496000	506000	to the Roman Empire and wanted to know what is the form of Yawism that is most popular, most well known, it wouldn't be Judaism or Christianity, it would be Yawism.
506000	523000	And we see that in many, many, many thousands of amulets and magical items and things like that, medallions all across the Roman Empire, where Yaw in the Greek, okay,
523000	527000	Yota, Omega, yeah, yeah, exactly, with Alpha Omega.
527000	531000	I run into this plot and it's a big topic on my channel, so yes, please.
531000	542000	But that is a form of Yawism, because the head of the pantheon is Yaw, and that continued alongside Christianity, alongside Judaism for centuries.
542000	547000	Of course, I assume that you have that, you see that a lot in your chow.
547000	559000	And if we're talking on the so-called Gnosticism, which is a term that I don't like, it's not a scientific term to call it Gnosticism, that's not how they identify.
559000	564000	I've established that a million times, it's a pantheon term, it's like, yeah.
564000	566000	Your viewers are familiar, yeah, great.
566000	573000	So Gnosticism, in a sense, is an outgrowth also of Yawism, an expression of Yawism as well.
573000	583000	There's a big discussion, as you probably know, whether Gnosticism has any Jewish roots in it or is it only a Christian phenomenon, actually, in reality, it's neither.
583000	589000	It's just a continuation of Yawism over the centuries.
589000	601000	Yawism simply was the greater force in the kind of cultic community that worshipped Yaw.
602000	615000	It started much earlier, continued while Judaism was being developed and Christianity and continued until at least the fall of the Roman Empire, but we can also, in a sense, it continues to this day.
615000	623000	For example, in Kabbalah and things like that, it continues, in a sense, Yawism continues to this day.
623000	633000	I'm not sure we want to have time to get into that, but that is the fundamental form of early Judaism.
633000	641000	Again, early Judaism is not the correct term, but what will also spawn off Judaism later on.
641000	645000	Okay, so there's a few different directions that I want to go.
645000	646000	That's all we do.
646000	648000	Excuse me, I just want to make sure something clear.
648000	649000	It's not my book.
649000	654000	It's an edited book, so it has a lot of different authors in it.
654000	662000	I just edited and I have also a chapter in that book, but I edited it together with Professor Reinhard Krotz from Gottikin University.
662000	664000	So it's not just me.
664000	668000	Well, even better, more expertise and more opinions.
668000	670000	I love it.
670000	674000	I love books like that or are papers that have multiple people involved.
674000	676000	Those are good stuff to read.
676000	680000	Yeah, we have great, we have really, I mean, top leading scholars.
680000	685000	You know, Conrad Schme, Margarita Fulmer, Tony Holm of Penn State University.
685000	687000	Stefan Schors and many, many others.
687000	689000	Kyle Vandertoon, of course, Reinhard Krotz as well.
689000	696000	So you really, in this book, you have truly the leading scholars in the field coming together.
696000	702000	Initially, it was a conference that I organized at the University of Haifa at the end of December of 22.
702000	705000	And the book came as a result of that.
705000	706000	It's not a proceedings book.
706000	711000	It's not just a list of just a collection of the papers that were presented.
711000	715000	These are papers that grew out of our interactions at the conference.
715000	718000	The conference was kind of a workshop.
718000	733000	And we interacted a lot during the conference and even later on to produce, to think together through all of these issues that concern the Achaemenid Empire and the Alwists at that time to produce this volume.
733000	742000	Okay, so it's, I mean, of course, I'm biased in a sense, but it is truly a groundbreaking book.
742000	745000	We all have our biases, but no, I can't wait to read this.
745000	748000	So, okay, so here's the two things that I want to get into.
748000	751000	One of them is elephantine.
751000	756000	Another one is that you mentioned this yaho, this three letter yaho or yahoo.
756000	760000	And in the Greek, so I actually have a screenshot that I had prepared.
760000	764000	It's from what we found in Qumran.
764000	765000	I think Qumran.
765000	766000	Yeah, yeah, Qumran.
766000	767000	Okay.
767000	775000	And this is, this is predates all these church Septuagint, the Codex Vaticanus, the Codex Sinaiticus, the Codex Alexandricus.
775000	780000	And it shows you right there in Deuteronomy, I think, is this Deuteronomy?
780000	781000	Leviticus.
781000	782000	Leviticus.
782000	783000	Yes, thank you for correcting me.
783000	785000	Right there in Leviticus, you have the name yaho.
785000	787000	And so there's that.
787000	792000	There's also, you also have in Aramaic, you have yahoo on these coins.
792000	795000	And this is Persian period, I believe.
795000	797000	And so there's three letters.
797000	803000	And we're all used to the Tetragrammaton, the four letter name of Yahweh, or we don't even know how it's pronounced, actually.
803000	804000	Just kind of guess.
804000	806000	So I'm saying Jehovah.
806000	809000	That's all totally more modern way to say it.
809000	814000	But I'm wondering, because there's a lot of theories on this name.
814000	821000	Now, there are some who points out, Diodorus of Sicily says this is the name of Dionysus.
821000	824000	There's actually a text in the Chaldean oracles.
824000	825000	I actually screen shot it.
825000	830000	It's the English translation, but it's the Thomas Taylor translation of the Chaldean oracles.
830000	835000	And he says, and right here I circled it, and I'll read it out just in case you can't see it.
835000	843000	He says Dionysus or Bacchus was called by the Chaldeans, yahoo, instead of the intelligible light in the Phoenician tongue.
843000	849000	He is frequently called Sabaoth, such as he who is above the seven poles, Demiurgus.
849000	852000	What are your, are they wrong?
852000	855000	Oh, and then one more thing I wanted to point out.
855000	862000	Plutarch in the early second century also says that Yahweh, or he hit the question in his text is called,
862000	864000	Who is the God worshiped by the Jews?
864000	869000	It's one of these dialogues that he puts together with Ammonius and a couple other people that he's with.
869000	871000	I forgot their names, but there's a whole list of them.
871000	873000	And he's like, who is this God that the Jews are worshiping?
873000	877000	He goes, it looks like to be like either a Donus or Dionysus.
877000	886000	And he gets a bunch of, he gets a bunch of really good arguments of like the similarities between the ways of the priests and the Ellusinian mystery dress.
886000	887000	They had the same colors.
887000	889000	They had the same tassels hanging down.
889000	890000	They play the same flutes.
890000	892000	They do Psalms, all this stuff.
892000	900000	I'm like, whoa, this is actually really, I was expecting to hear a really like kind of a weak argument of why they think that.
900000	902000	But it wasn't Plutarch lays it out.
902000	904000	And I'm like, I wonder what scholars think about this.
904000	906000	And you don't hear about it a lot.
907000	915000	Now you've been digging into this from the expert, from your expertise, from a scholarly position, looking at the facts.
915000	917000	What's, how do we sort this out?
917000	918000	So two things.
918000	922000	I mean, first of all, that has, that's really appeared much later than the book that we're talking about.
922000	930000	So, and so I will talk about this very quickly, but then I'd like to refocus our, our discussion on that on the Achaemenid period.
930000	935000	But that, I mean, the points that you're, that you're, that you're making are important and interesting.
935000	941000	And of course, very, very, very, very apropos as well to the development of Fiawism.
941000	944000	You did not mention also Macrobius.
944000	945000	That's later.
945000	946000	I didn't want to go too late.
946000	948000	Well, but it's the same.
948000	949000	It's exactly the same vein.
949000	952000	I mean, we are talking later, but Macrobius, you're right.
952000	958000	It's later, but the way he, I mean, and he's quoting, he's actually quoting a text from the second century.
958000	959000	Yeah.
959000	960000	He's right here.
960000	961000	Right here.
961000	962000	Yeah.
962000	963000	Wait, right.
963000	964000	He says this, yeah.
964000	965000	Yeah.
965000	967000	Oh, I'll read it out for people so we can all be on the same page.
967000	976000	He says, the Orpheans calling Eubola, good counsel, point to this God having been provided for if the plans of the mind are born of conception.
976000	981000	The authors think that the mind of the world is the sun from which the principle of understanding flows into men.
981000	984000	They believe that the sun stood before the merit of good plan.
984000	987000	Orpheus clearly pronounces that the sun in this free verse.
987000	994000	And then that says in Greek, Helios on Dionysus, Epic, Klessin, Kellius, Ian.
994000	1001000	And then he says under that, right underneath that he says one Zeus, one Hades, one Helios, one Dionysus.
1001000	1003000	And then this is the part that you're getting into.
1003000	1004000	He actually calls.
1004000	1007000	He actually names this syncretic God.
1007000	1008000	Yeah.
1008000	1010000	Oh, the three letters that we just talked about.
1010000	1014000	And he cites this oracle of Apolloclarius.
1014000	1018000	He's basically saying that this God is like the supreme God.
1018000	1019000	Okay.
1019000	1021000	So now we're now we're getting later in time.
1021000	1024000	But as you mentioned, he's citing earlier sources.
1024000	1027000	This is something that I've been talking about on my channel for a while.
1027000	1028000	So let's.
1028000	1029000	All right.
1029000	1030000	Now we have everyone on the same page.
1030000	1031000	Now.
1031000	1035000	Now this is this actually goes back to the point I was making yawism continued.
1035000	1039000	This is this is an evolution of yawism.
1039000	1044000	And the last thing, the chat, the match, the Greek magical papyri.
1044000	1045000	Yeah.
1045000	1047000	Oh, it's all over the place.
1047000	1048000	Every single passage.
1048000	1049000	Yeah.
1049000	1058000	So, and that's why I'm saying if we were to go back in time, you know, 1700 or even 1600 years back or of course 2000 years back.
1058000	1065000	And we wanted to know what is the kind of the most popular form of yawism of the date yaw?
1065000	1066000	Where is it?
1066000	1073000	Where is this daily being most kind of worshipped or for lack of a better term?
1073000	1075000	It would not be in Judaism or Christianity.
1075000	1077000	It would be much more.
1077000	1083000	And it's not only where yawists in a sense, very popular.
1083000	1088000	And the reason I'm saying in a sense is that this was not nothing was exclusive at that time.
1088000	1100000	You could be, you could believe in your magic amulets and, you know, in texts and things like that and curse text that yaw is going to protect you.
1100000	1109000	But at the same time go and offer sacrifices to Mithra, you know, and or to the Roman emperor or to the or different deities, etc.
1109000	1114000	Nothing was, nothing was absolutely exclusive.
1114000	1130000	And also Jews and Christians also had, you know, moments where they went in and became yawists for a while, at least in terms of curses and magic formulae.
1130000	1138000	So, so yawism was always there, not in the background, but in the foreground.
1138000	1146000	In terms of, and it was an extremely popular, I mean, yawism was extremely popular also across the empire.
1146000	1162000	Now this also helps to explain, because you know, the Roman empire was at a point where it's in the fourth century where it was almost, it kind of had, it would have gone either with Mithra, Mithraism or Christianity, you know.
1162000	1174000	And what, and let me guess what you have to say, I just have to, this is so exciting, because this is something that I've really been, I, and me, I went into this evidence kind of blindly just kind of leading where it see where it takes me.
1174000	1179000	And I came to the conclusion that like, this explains the rise of Christianity in a way.
1179000	1181000	Right. Exactly.
1181000	1182000	Exactly.
1182000	1186000	This is what made Christianity a lot more palpable to to the Romans.
1186000	1195000	And this is why the church, the early church fathers had to combat the remnants of yawism all over the empire. Right.
1195000	1198000	So that's, that's what he wrote against what we call the Nostics.
1198000	1201000	In a sense, the Nostics are simply yawists.
1201000	1202000	Okay.
1202000	1208000	And so, and so the, or what they call Nostics again, this term is so, so misleading.
1208000	1212000	But all of the different sects, you know, the Sethians, etc.
1212000	1217000	All of these different, different forms of yawism are simply forms of yawism.
1217000	1219000	A lot of them call them magus too.
1219000	1221000	You hear that Simon magus, Marcus magus.
1221000	1225000	So there, there's some sort of Persian stuff going on here, which is what we're going to get.
1225000	1233000	Well, you know, the magus, so magus, now we're starting to go back to the Persian complex and I'd like to, to continue with that.
1233000	1244000	Yeah, but magus, you know, in the Greek sources, there were several major people who were called magus.
1244000	1247000	And one of them was Moses.
1247000	1248000	Wow.
1248000	1253000	So one of them, they considered Moses to be a magus as well in several Greek sources.
1253000	1254000	Yep.
1254000	1256000	That's fascinating.
1256000	1273000	Yeah, they considered Moses was, what's really interesting about Moses, about the figure of Moses is if we were to go back even further back in time to the third century, and even the second, early second century BCE, but mainly in the third century, and even late
1273000	1276000	force or late force to the early second.
1276000	1283000	And we wanted to know what people think of Moses, we would get at least five completely different stories.
1284000	1285000	Right.
1285000	1287000	I can tell you some of there is probably the first person.
1287000	1288000	That's right.
1288000	1289000	That's right.
1289000	1290000	Well, that's one of the sources.
1290000	1291000	Absolutely.
1291000	1312000	He was, Moses was seen as this military leader who defeated the Ethiopians, or one that defeated other, other Nubian tribes, or a magus, an alchemist, or, and it has echoes in the Bible, you know, how well this was an alchemist and, you know, we're able to do all these, all these to, to, to, to make nature do what he, what he wanted.
1313000	1337000	But, but also that Moses was the, the, the teacher of Orpheus, because he was, I've been all over that verse, because I want people to look guys, these Alexandrians, these Jews and Alexandria, they're calling themselves Orphics, basically, they're saying, Mousseus, this guy from Athens is the same as Moses and there's all tell us about that and then let's get back to the Persians.
1337000	1338000	Yeah.
1338000	1341000	I mean, that's just typical kind of popular etymology.
1341000	1346000	In Greek, Mousseus sounds like it's the mused, you know, the muses.
1346000	1351000	And so, and so you hear that and you're like, yeah, that's the teacher of Orpheus.
1351000	1359000	He was also seen, as I said, as a magus, as a magus, as an alchemist, as someone who can bend the rules of nature according to his will.
1359000	1360000	And so, yeah.
1360000	1370000	And so that also shows that the story of Moses and who that, who that was, was not decided even in the third century BCE.
1370000	1371000	Okay.
1371000	1374000	There was not, there was no canonical version.
1374000	1380000	They, what's interesting in these versions of Moses is that they're not polemic.
1380000	1383000	You know, they're not even debating other versions.
1383000	1388000	They're not trying to show how their version is correct and like the biblical version is wrong.
1388000	1389000	They're simply ignorant.
1389000	1392000	They don't know of the biblical version.
1392000	1393000	Right.
1393000	1398000	That's another important thing is like this Moses is completely different than we think of today.
1398000	1399000	That's right.
1399000	1402000	Well, that's what's interesting is it's not completely different.
1402000	1413000	The Bible shows, I think, took all of these images of Moses that were already current in the region in Ptolemaic, you know, in the Ptolemaic regions.
1413000	1421000	And, and, and is the Bible is polemic, polemic with those versions.
1421000	1424000	So it is, it is, it takes elements.
1424000	1435000	We do see elements, for example, of Moses being doing supernatural things, parting the seas, although all of the, you know, and tossing the rods and they become old.
1435000	1444000	So we do see elements that were popular in the Greek culture being adopted by the, by the, by the biblical authors.
1444000	1446000	But, but we don't see the other way around.
1446000	1450000	The, the, the, the more the earlier sources are not arguing.
1450000	1453000	They are simply unfamiliar with the biblical sources.
1453000	1457000	They present him as sort of like a superhero magus character who's correct.
1457000	1458000	Yeah.
1458000	1464000	Doing a bunch of magic and he's kind of a hero type typical of Hellenism, Hellenistic.
1464000	1465000	Absolutely.
1465000	1466000	Hero character.
1466000	1468000	Um, and it's fat.
1468000	1469000	Okay.
1469000	1470000	That is fascinating.
1470000	1473000	You got this mousseus character and Athens and then there's Moses down in Alexandria.
1473000	1475000	And they're sort of trying to figure out.
1475000	1478000	We're trying to figure out if it's the same person or not.
1478000	1479000	Orpheus also.
1479000	1488000	And in the James Charles worth student picker father, there's a whole chapter on Orpheka text that these Jewish orpheka text.
1488000	1490000	And look at what Orpheus is.
1490000	1492000	He's a, he's a psalmist.
1492000	1497000	He's playing music on a harp and there it's theological, theological music.
1497000	1499000	He's called theologian.
1499000	1501000	That's where that word comes from the first time there.
1501000	1503000	First time people ever use the word theologian.
1503000	1504000	It's for Orpheus.
1504000	1509000	And some of his texts are referred to as apocalypses revelations.
1509000	1514000	So a lot of the same technical terminology we're seeing for Judeo Christianity.
1514000	1517000	We're seeing in these orphics in Alexandria.
1517000	1518000	Yeah.
1518000	1519000	Absolutely.
1519000	1528000	So what's interesting is also, even in the second century, the, the, the, the exagogue of Ezekiel, I'm assuming you're familiar with that.
1528000	1537000	That's a play, a Greek play that was written in Alexandria, probably performed in Alexandria, where a Jewish author that is completely canonized.
1537000	1539000	I mean, he writes perfectly.
1539000	1540000	Tragedy.
1540000	1541000	And if I'm not mistaken, right.
1541000	1542000	Exactly.
1542000	1544000	He's an Ezekiel Tragedy.
1544000	1554000	And even his version of Moses in the second century, so relatively late second century BCE is not exactly the biblical version.
1554000	1556000	It's also kind of a mishmash.
1556000	1561000	He is familiar now with the biblical version and he is dealing with it.
1561000	1564000	Or at least the version that is very close to what we know from the Bible.
1564000	1573000	But it's, but even in the second century, in Alexandria, second century BCE, that's the story of Moses was still not completely canonized.
1573000	1579000	Was not, was not completely, did not reach the form that we are familiar today.
1579000	1580000	You ready for this?
1580000	1581000	This is a question.
1581000	1585000	And I want this might, your answer might shock some people with this.
1585000	1593000	Who is the first person that we can say with a name, not just always mentioned in some biblical text, but that we can put a name.
1593000	1597000	And a date on, who's the first person to mention Moses?
1597000	1606000	Well, I mean, it's hard to tell because we do have some sources that are that seem to mention Moses, but they're quoted in much later sources.
1606000	1609000	And that we need a huge grain of salt for that.
1609000	1612000	I mean, we do have Hecateus of Adara.
1612000	1618000	Yeah, Hecateus of Adara, but only quoted in much later Christian sources that are trying to make point and are polemical.
1618000	1621000	Oh, so you're saying you're saying that's the one they're citing.
1621000	1622000	That's right.
1622000	1624000	Because we lost the Hecateus of Adara.
1624000	1625000	Correct.
1625000	1627000	Yeah, we lost the original.
1627000	1629000	So they're citing him.
1629000	1641000	Now, in many cases, the citations are fine, but we need to take each case, each case independently and evaluate how, you know, how likely it is to be, to be, to be accurate.
1641000	1645000	In many, in many cases, I have my doubts.
1645000	1656000	But let's, you know, let's, let's be very open here and say, you know what, let's even accept that we're talking about Hecateus of Adara late fourth century.
1656000	1658000	So what's that?
1658000	1660000	Like 320 BC, something like that.
1660000	1661000	Right.
1661000	1667000	So even then, even if that is the first time a Moses is mentioned, that's very late.
1667000	1668000	Very late.
1668000	1670000	That's why I mean by like, this might shock some people.
1670000	1682000	How often is, because, okay, here's another thing that I, because I've been bouncing these ideas off with biblical scholars who are more on the not, I wouldn't say conservative side.
1682000	1687000	They're not conservative, but like, they're more on like the, they're going with the, what's the earliest we can date it.
1687000	1692000	We're kind of going at, we're trying to find the exact time where we can date things based on what we know for sure.
1692000	1698000	These, these scholars, and I'm thinking, I'm not going to name names here, but like, they're going with like, oh, what about seventh century BC?
1698000	1702000	There's a, there's a reference here in one of the prophets.
1702000	1705000	Is there, do the prophets seem to know Moses?
1705000	1708000	I don't think they do.
1708000	1715000	Well, I'm laughing because, because, I mean, I cannot take the Bible as an historical source.
1715000	1716000	Okay.
1716000	1718000	I have to say that very clearly.
1718000	1720000	No one should.
1720000	1725000	Now there are, the Bible does have, of course.
1725000	1730000	That's how to, how to phrase that does have historical elements in it.
1730000	1733000	But he's, but it's not a historical source.
1733000	1742000	Now, like, for example, for example, there are, you know, certain Assyrian kings that are mentioned in the Bible and are mentioned within the context that makes sense.
1742000	1745000	But the Bible is not interested in them as a historical source.
1745000	1746000	It's interested in them.
1746000	1748000	It's interested for, for different reasons.
1748000	1759000	And, and it's very, very easy to take historical, a kind of a nucleus, a seed of, of a historical fact and make out, make a story out of it.
1759000	1761000	We do it to this day.
1761000	1770000	And so, and so we need to be very, very careful with the Bible in terms of historical and to say what the prophets knew.
1770000	1778000	That is, that, that statement's the prophets knew of, or Hosea knew of X, you know, Hosea knew of the Exodus from Egypt, for example.
1778000	1780000	I get that a lot.
1780000	1788000	What, I mean, how do you know that that particular verse really was not edited into the text in the 3rd century or 2nd century BC?
1788000	1790000	You can't know that.
1790000	1802000	Let me jump in right there because we know that the version, the, the, the condition, I don't know how to say condition or the form that we have our prophets.
1802000	1805000	We know that there is layers that are added layer.
1805000	1807000	We know that there is additions that are changed.
1807000	1809000	We know that there's added, edited edits.
1809000	1810000	I'm sorry.
1810000	1811000	Redactions.
1811000	1813000	We don't, we, but okay.
1813000	1820000	Is it possible that there's a layer from Isaiah that dates back to whatever 6th century BC or something like that?
1820000	1822000	Possibly yes.
1822000	1825000	But, but is, and I would say yes, I would say fine.
1825000	1833000	Yeah, there probably was a guy named Isaiah, but the form that we have it in today, there's no way you're going to sit there and tell me that this is exactly how it was.
1833000	1844000	Well, I mean, to be very scientific about it, I, and that's really what I'm trying to do in my research and with my students and to go and to be as scientific as possible about this.
1844000	1852000	I would not be able to say that as a historian, I would not even be able to say there was an actual person called Isaiah.
1852000	1855000	Because there's simply not no scientific proof for that.
1855000	1870000	But I could, but, but is a text, some pericope, some text is currently in what we know from Isaiah from the book of what's called the book of Isaiah is that was already authored in the 7th century.
1870000	1871000	Sure, why not.
1871000	1875000	And that, that I would agree with, with that statement.
1875000	1883000	But, and I have an article, for example, about about the, the introduction, right, the oracles against the nations on in the book of Amos.
1883000	1884000	Okay.
1884000	1892000	Just this particular only these verses just this and I'm not dating the entire book and just dating the oracles.
1892000	1912000	And I'm dating them because and I was able to date them to the late eight and beginning of the 7th century, because I can relate them to, to new Assyrian sources and I show that whomever wrote those passages are these verses new very in great detail.
1912000	1918000	These are expressions from New York, neo Assyrian inscriptions and things like that.
1918000	1919000	So I can date.
1919000	1921000	And again, I'm not even saying that they were written.
1921000	1933000	I mean, they could be already transmitted from that period, but whomever, whomever came up with these texts and might have transmitted them, you know, right from father to son or whatever orally over the centuries before they were written down.
1933000	1941000	But the, the seed for these oracles was late 730, late 837 century BC.
1941000	1957000	Now I was able, I'm able to do that because I can, I can show that they take new Assyrian imperial idiomatic expressions and implement them very systematically within the, the, the Amos, the introduction to Amos.
1957000	1959000	That's what you have to do.
1959000	1963000	See, that's what that's scientific.
1963000	1964000	Exactly.
1964000	1968000	You have, you always need to have a reference outside the Bible in order to date the Bible.
1968000	1970000	You cannot date the Bible from internal data.
1970000	1971000	Right.
1971000	1973000	You need something relative to base it off of.
1973000	1974000	Correct.
1974000	1975000	Correct.
1975000	1976000	Yeah.
1976000	1979000	This is now, this is where we get into the whole, how do we test people?
1979000	1981000	Because people think I'm biased.
1981000	1982000	I'm trying to attack the Bible.
1982000	1983000	I'm biased.
1983000	1989000	And I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, I really, I really don't care how old it is or when it's Hellenistic or Persian or what.
1989000	1990000	I just want to know.
1990000	1992000	And like, there's ways we can test this.
1992000	1998000	So for example, you mentioned that there's a lot of, I was watching your lectures and you talk about this.
1998000	2003000	How these, there's idioms that we can tell that are either Persian period.
2003000	2008000	Sometimes they use words that are from the Avestan language, which is an Indo-European language.
2008000	2013000	So it's like, that can't be, that can't go beyond, well, maybe it could.
2013000	2019000	But I'm saying it's not likely that it can go past the Persian period into some sort of archaic period.
2019000	2024000	And then there's even some that are Hellenistic that we were like, whoa, that's got to be written in like 200 BC.
2024000	2027000	So to sort of bring it back to the Persian period.
2027000	2034000	How do you detest and determine what is a Persian period versus what is not even just the temple?
2034000	2036000	Like, how do we describe things in the temple?
2036000	2046000	I'll say something that might shock a lot of people, but basically in the Persian period, we have thousands of documents from your mystic slash Jewish sources.
2046000	2052000	When I combine all of the documents from Egypt, not just elephantine, mostly an elephantine, but not just.
2052000	2057000	And Babylonia, the different settlements in Babylonia, El Yahudu and others.
2057000	2066000	And in Judea and Samaria, these provinces, which we have very little texts from Judea and Samaria,
2066000	2069000	but we have coins, we have representations and things like that.
2069000	2080000	So when I look at all of this data, all of it together, there is literally zero evidence for any knowledge and any familiarity with the Bible throughout the entire period.
2080000	2088000	Okay, hold on. Let's explain this now. This is a lot. This is a big claim right here.
2088000	2092000	So when you talk about, first of all, if anyone doesn't know what we mean by elephantine.
2092000	2103000	So in 597 BC, I think that's roughly the date when Nebuchadnezzar, Sax, Israel, Jerusalem and the north, I don't know.
2103000	2105000	Maybe it's the north or the south.
2105000	2110000	Well, I mean, yeah, there were waves, but we were usually talking about 586.
2110000	2118000	586, okay. So what happens as a result, as you said, there's different dates and different battles that happen and different attacks.
2118000	2128000	But roughly around this period in the 6th century BC, Israel was under attack and they start to flee south to Egypt, almost in a reversal exodus in a weird way.
2128000	2130000	They're leaving their...
2130000	2132000	Except there wasn't an exodus.
2132000	2134000	Right, right, right. Except there wasn't an exodus.
2134000	2138000	My channel has established that many times, but that's a whole nother.
2138000	2141000	We can get into that another time probably, because that's a whole nother can of worms.
2141000	2144000	But we're talking about later, we're talking about...
2144000	2148000	Well, actually, that does kind of relate in a way, but we can circle back to that.
2148000	2151000	All right, so we're talking about 6th century BC.
2151000	2156000	There are Israel, Judeans, what did you call them? Israelites or Judeans?
2156000	2158000	Well, I called them Yahwists.
2158000	2160000	I called them Yahwists.
2160000	2162000	Now, I have a number of articles about this.
2162000	2172000	I have an article about the date in which the Colony of Elephantine was established, about the migration under the Egyptian King Amassees II.
2172000	2177000	So I have an article that establishes that date from a lot of different perspectives.
2177000	2186000	And I show that all of these different perspectives meet around 540, 550 BC.
2186000	2191000	Oh, so okay, a few decades later then, is when they flee.
2191000	2192000	That's right.
2192000	2197000	But I have another article about Yahwistic identity at the time.
2197000	2203000	And I show that Yahwistic, and on this article, people might even call me conservative.
2203000	2205000	But I just follow the data.
2205000	2206000	How the data?
2206000	2209000	And so, yeah, I just follow the data.
2209000	2212000	I don't care if you call me minimalist or maximalist or conservative or whatever.
2212000	2214000	I just follow the data.
2214000	2221000	And so I have another article about the Yahwistic identity in the Achaemenid period that just came out a couple of months ago.
2222000	2236000	And that article, in that article, I show from archeological evidence, names, mostly onomastics at the time, that there was around the time of the sack of Jerusalem, around the time of Nebuchadnezzar.
2236000	2240000	I mean, it started earlier, it started at the end of the seventh century.
2240000	2250000	But there was already a shift, a kind of a cultic reform that created a unified Yahwistic identity, not just Judean.
2250000	2264000	But a unified Yahwistic identity that was pretty, pretty uniform in Judea, in Samaria, in Babylonia, and later on in Elephantine, and of course other places.
2264000	2268000	And we see it in the names so clearly.
2268000	2275000	Now the names are, the names are, personal names are really your most kind of intimate identity, right?
2275000	2280000	That's your, usually you inherit it from your father or your grandfather and things like that, or from your mother.
2280000	2286000	And in people, you know, it goes from generation to generation, it is your identity, your familial identity.
2286000	2291000	It's a big part of who you are, your personal name, certainly in antiquity.
2292000	2308000	And we see that in Samaria, prior to the end, or to the end of the seventh century BCE, in Samaria, most of the Yahwistic names had the the the the the the the the deity part.
2308000	2314000	Usually names in antiquity are composed of an adjective or a verb with a name of a deity.
2314000	2324000	So for example, Hosea means Yahweh has saved or redeemed, or Yahushama Yahweh has heard and things like that.
2324000	2328000	And you have it for a lot of different deities across the region, not just for Yahweh.
2328000	2332000	And so these are the theophoric names, right?
2332000	2336000	Names that have the theos, the deity embedded in this.
2336000	2346000	In Samaria, it was for uniform for a long time, that the Yahwistic element in these names is Yo, not Yaho or Yah, but Yo.
2346000	2348000	Okay, that was the name.
2348000	2352000	And in the south, in Judea, it was Yah or Yaho.
2352000	2363000	There was a very clear distinction in how you write the name or pronounce the name in the in the names of the divine name within the personal names of people.
2363000	2365000	That stopped, that shifted.
2365000	2367000	I mean, the data is so clear.
2367000	2378000	The names shift very clearly to the Judean form, okay, to Yah or Yaho towards the end of the 7th century and into the 6th century.
2378000	2382000	But after the fall of Jerusalem, it becomes uniform, completely uniform.
2382000	2390000	Whether you're in Samaria, whether you're in Judea, in Egypt or in Babylonia, it's all Yah, Yaho everywhere.
2390000	2395000	This is clearly a cultic reform that was very powerful.
2395000	2405000	I mean, when you give up your name, okay, when you, if you're from Samaria and all of your, you know, all of your genealogy is all Yo, you know, names.
2405000	2407000	And now you change it to Yaho.
2407000	2416000	And in fact, we have, we found an example in the archaeological record of the same person switching their name from Yo to Yaho.
2416000	2419000	And so that, and I mentioned that in the article.
2419000	2429000	And so that was a major cultic reform among Yahwists in the end of the 7th century and into the 6th century BC.
2429000	2432000	Now, this is just a name reform.
2432000	2438000	We don't see any other, it's not like they had new observances or new, you know, new laws that they had to follow.
2438000	2441000	We don't see anything like that at that time period.
2441000	2449000	But somehow there was a, this idea that we need to form one community across.
2449000	2460000	And this is, this is probably the result of these waves of exile that started from the end of the 8th century through a little bit to the 7th century and into the 6th century.
2460000	2470000	All of these waves of exiles and communities leaving, living in different places start wanting to have a more unified identity.
2470000	2474000	And yeah, yeah.
2474000	2485000	And so they're, okay, so they're going from what we would call Canaan, Judea, Israel, modern day Israel, whatever, Palestine, that region.
2485000	2489000	They're leaving that region because they're being sacked by these Assyrians.
2489000	2495000	And there's waves of them moving south into Egypt and they're settling in this city called Elephantine.
2496000	2498000	Island, yes.
2498000	2501000	And they're all the way, they're way far away now.
2501000	2503000	And they set up in this island there.
2503000	2510000	And then so what I'm gathered from what you're saying, what other people are saying is like, we have a lot of evidence of what they have.
2510000	2514000	We have tons of papayri and we have Ostraca.
2514000	2521000	We have a ton of evidence and we can look at what these people believed in and what their culture was like to a certain extent.
2521000	2532000	And so this is where people, this is where things get kind of crazy because the narrative is that these Israelites already had this sort of religion.
2532000	2539000	This is second, or at the end of the first temple period, so they already know about Solomon and David and Moses and Noah and Abraham.
2539000	2541000	And that's, of course, they already know about that stuff.
2541000	2543000	And they probably already read Isaiah.
2543000	2545000	They probably already know.
2546000	2548000	This is what everyone assumes.
2548000	2561000	So you're thinking these Jews that came down from, or Yahwehs that come down from this region into Elephantine, we're assuming that we're going to find stuff about Moses, stuff about Abraham, stuff about Noah.
2561000	2563000	Because that's predating the first temple period.
2563000	2565000	Of course they know this stuff.
2565000	2568000	But what really do we find there?
2568000	2569000	Right.
2569000	2575000	Of course, none of this predates the Persian period or even the Hellenistic period, I would say.
2575000	2577000	I mean, I wouldn't say none of this.
2577000	2589000	But I mean, I'm sure that the editors and the redactors and even the authors of many parts of the Torah, of the Pentateuch, used older material as well.
2589000	2594000	So some strands of older material is there, certainly in even going back centuries.
2594000	2601000	I wouldn't go back as far as, you know, the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age.
2601000	2612000	But some of the material is certainly older, much older than the Hellenistic period, where these things, according to my research, have been put together.
2612000	2620000	So, but in Elephantine, it's fascinating what we, the community at Elephantine, as I said, not just Elephantine.
2620000	2632000	Everywhere, I mean, we, as I said, we have thousands of documents if we combine everything from Egypt to get not just Elephantine and Babylonia and the provinces of Judea and Samaria.
2632000	2640000	If we combine all of this together and look for the smallest hint of familiarity with the Bible, there is none.
2640000	2642000	There's simply none.
2642000	2645000	The Bible simply did not exist.
2645000	2648000	So how many thousands, how many texts do we have?
2648000	2652000	First of all, how big is the sample size of texts that we have there?
2652000	2655000	Can we get some estimation?
2655000	2656000	Is there a thousand texts?
2656000	2657000	Is there 100?
2657000	2658000	Is there 500?
2658000	2659000	What do we...
2659000	2666000	When I say texts, I mean, I'm combining Ostraca and Papyri together with tablets.
2666000	2675000	So in the El Yehudu, we're talking about hundreds of tablets, several hundreds in Elephantine and India in general.
2675000	2685000	So, and of course, all of the numismatic, meaning coins, coins that are also very important, different short names, things like that.
2685000	2693000	Even Wadi Dahlia, the Wadi Dahlia documents which were found in Samaria in the late fourth century or middle fourth century BCE.
2693000	2702000	Those are really interesting because these, those papyri that, again, are found in Samaria, written by Samarian Jews, Samarian Yahwists,
2702000	2710000	are contracts in which Yahwists are selling Yahwists, slaves who are also Yahwists, two other Yahwists.
2710000	2714000	And this, of course, goes against what's written in the Torah.
2714000	2718000	But they are clearly doing something that is completely against the...
2718000	2728000	We have a lot of examples of things that are completely against the Torah and you can excuse every one of these single examples and start to explain,
2728000	2733000	well, you know, maybe profit was more important than adherence to the laws.
2733000	2735000	You can excuse every single...
2735000	2742000	But when you look at the totality of the data, okay, it is absolutely...
2742000	2749000	There's only data of stuff that either is completely ignorant of the Bible or completely goes against it.
2749000	2760000	But there's not one single piece of evidence that we can point to that says these people were familiar with the Bible.
2760000	2767000	Nothing. I mean, look, people often ask me, well, what kind of documents do you have at Tel Aviv or in other places?
2767000	2771000	Most of the documents are legal documents, contracts and things like that.
2771000	2778000	But we do have personal letters. We have Ostracahs. Ostracahs are like basically the WhatsApp of the ancient world, right?
2778000	2785000	These are short messages that you give to someone in the market to pass on to someone else.
2785000	2791000	And so these are kind of the quick communication methods in the ancient world.
2791000	2795000	And so we have kind of, you know, the equivalent of WhatsApp messages.
2795000	2803000	We have personal letters. We have contracts. We have formal letters written to...
2803000	2806000	Yeah, a lot of data.
2806000	2812000	How much time does it span? So you said in the fifth, or is it sixth century BC?
2812000	2818000	Yeah, about 540, 550 BCE to 399 BC. That's elephantine.
2818000	2820000	We're talking two centuries worth of data.
2820000	2823000	A century and a half of data.
2823000	2835000	And according, I mean, my research points to the really good possibility that after that they also migrated up the river, up the Nile to Edfau,
2835000	2844000	where we have later on in the fourth century, we have a very interesting community of Yaouists as well, right there.
2844000	2853000	And several concepts that will make it into, quote-unquote, Gnosticism are already found in elephantine.
2853000	2860000	Especially if you, you know, your channel probably knows a lot about, I mean, dedicated to...
2860000	2863000	I don't know dedicated, but a lot deals with Gnosticism.
2863000	2867000	You know that the deity, Khnubis.
2867000	2871000	Khnubis, very popular deity in, especially in Egypt.
2871000	2876000	It comes from Khnuma, the deity Khnum, that is the main deity of elephantine.
2876000	2879000	Yeah, he's that, that horned ram head.
2879000	2888000	Ram, that's right, the ram deity from elephantine, and he is the, really kind of the one who dwells in elephantine.
2888000	2897000	And the first time the form of the name Khnuma changes to Khnubis, the third time we have it recorded,
2897000	2906000	is in elephantine among the Yaouists there, when they write to the Persian authorities about the attacks on their temple on the island.
2906000	2910000	So first of all, they had the temple, and I need to tell that to the viewers.
2910000	2919000	Of course, the Yaouists had a Yaouistic temple on the island that was very similar in size to the description that we have in the Bible for the Solomonic temple.
2919000	2930000	And yeah, so it was a major, you know, it was relatively major, very little has remained to this day, but we do have, some of it has remained to this day.
2930000	2943000	We do know where the temple was, and we still, we can see if you visit the island, which I highly recommend, you can see the kind of the pavement of the temple in one wall, or kind of an angle.
2944000	2958000	In any event, that when they talk, they always throughout their, they often referred, I mean, not often, but they sometimes refer to Khnum in the records from the early 5th century on, they refer to the day to Khnum.
2958000	2965000	But only when they talk about how the priests of Khnum attacked their temple, then they say Khnub.
2965000	2973000	Okay, so they move to this term Khnubis, that will become very so popular, as you know, in so called Gnostic circles.
2973000	2988000	But the first time it is recorded is actually among the Yaouists at Elephantine as a pejorative almost term, because it only in when he attacks, when his priests attacks, attack them.
2988000	2996000	So that's a fascinating thing that needs to be studied further, of course, but you see elements like that, you see Anat Yaou.
2996000	3017000	So Anat, the date, the goddess Anat Yaou, which is a kind of a dyad of Anat Enyaou, that in one of my articles about the interpretation of Yudaika in the Achaemeni period, I also, I show that this date, he had a very long life.
3017000	3025000	And we see that deity as Anat Yaou, also used in amulets and medallions and so called Gnostic medallions.
3025000	3041000	So a lot of these things that are recorded for the first time in the community at Elephantine, find their way into Yaouistic circles or so called Gnostic circles that are recorded centuries later.
3041000	3048000	So somehow they were transmitted over the centuries and over the generations on and in the recorded later on.
3048000	3062000	So this community at Elephantine is extremely important, not just for the study of Yaowism slash Judaism, but also for the study of Gnosticism and again with all my problems that I have with that term.
3063000	3068000	And so it is a massively important community.
3068000	3075000	Now, as I said, my research shows that they arrived around in the mid-6th century BCE.
3075000	3084000	They probably arrived first at Aswan, which is the city facing the island of Elephantine.
3084000	3094000	Now Elephantine, it's important to understand, Elephantine was a major Egyptian cultic site for thousands of years before the Yaowists came.
3094000	3098000	Herodotus writes about it too. Herodotus was there when they were there.
3098000	3099000	Right.
3099000	3102000	And he doesn't mention them, but he was...
3102000	3106000	He says there's 12 gnomes, I think he kind of says it.
3106000	3112000	So there is something, I don't know if that lines up right now, which is a coincidence, but he does say something like that.
3112000	3116000	But you're right. He doesn't say anything about Jews or Yahweh or anything like that.
3116000	3122000	No, I mean, for him, because he probably saw them as Persians, I mean, for him, they represented the empire.
3122000	3127000	But Herodotus was there and certainly recorded that.
3127000	3135000	But my claim is that, and this is what archaeology shows us for the island, is that they first came to Aswan.
3135000	3141000	Aswan is maybe 100 meters, 200 meters away from the island and it's really close.
3141000	3147000	And so they came to Aswan, settled there for a while, built the temple on the island.
3147000	3149000	That's another mystery we don't really understand.
3149000	3158000	The only cultic system, the only people that were allowed to build the temple on Elephantine.
3158000	3170000	Again, Elephantine was, as I said, the major cultic center in Egyptian theology for thousands of years before the Jews came, before the Yaowists came.
3170000	3174000	And so, I mean, it was believed.
3174000	3179000	I mean, the reason it was so important is this is the first cataract of the island.
3179000	3187000	So if you navigate down the Nile, that's where the waters start being unstable.
3187000	3191000	It's a cataract and you can't really navigate the waters anymore.
3191000	3204000	So in Egyptian world conception, the waters of the annual inundation of the Nile came from Elephantine.
3204000	3217000	So they had an idea that there's a well and there are two caves under the island from which the waters flow into the Nile and, in fact, into the entire globe.
3217000	3222000	And that's the source of the waters for the entire world.
3222000	3226000	It's sort of like a border of the empire, in a way.
3226000	3231000	Yeah, I mean, the border of the empire shifted constantly.
3231000	3236000	But this was, in terms of the waters, this was the source of the waters for the entire...
3236000	3239000	Because it was the first cataract, it was such a big deal.
3239000	3243000	It is still the first cataract, of course, and it was such a big deal for them.
3243000	3253000	That was the source of the waters flowing into the Nile and then from the Nile into the Mediterranean, of course, and into the entire world.
3253000	3266000	It's funny because I was in Elephantine last June and I was sitting there with some of the elders of the island, just a great lunch and just talking.
3266000	3271000	And they started telling me, of course, they knew nothing about me and my research,
3271000	3279000	but they started telling me about the well that they have there and how this is the source of the water for the entire world.
3279000	3281000	And I felt like Herodotus.
3281000	3286000	You know, you feel like, I mean, that's exactly what Herodotus heard in his day.
3286000	3292000	I mean, he heard the elders of the island saying exactly the same legend to him as if it was, you know, that's what they believe in.
3292000	3294000	That's fine. I respect that.
3294000	3307000	Still, for me, I was really moved by this because, you know, you hear firsthand the same story that Herodotus wrote down 2,500 years ago.
3307000	3310000	It's pretty amazing experience.
3310000	3317000	Anyway, so this island was a major cultic center because of the annual inundation of the Nile.
3317000	3322000	And therefore, you know, the cult of Khnoum, of the deity Khnoum was so important there.
3322000	3327000	And it literally affected your, the economy, the entire land of Egypt.
3327000	3339000	The fact that they allow the Yawists to build a temple that was literally adjacent to the temple of Khnoum is something that we can't really explain sufficiently yet.
3339000	3346000	But there must have been some very, there must have been some kind of, another term that I'm not a fan of, syncretism.
3346000	3355000	Some kind of connection that the Egyptians also accepted between Yaw and Khnoum, which is why they would allow that.
3355000	3362000	But again, this is speculation. We don't really have a convincing explanation for this.
3362000	3368000	Yeah, and then they continue to live on the island up to, yeah.
3368000	3373000	Well, that god Khnoum is sort of a demiurgic god. He's depicted as holding the potter's wheel.
3373000	3375000	He creates humans. He's very...
3375000	3378000	Which is a thing that you also find in the Bible, right?
3378000	3386000	Also, not just that, but he also creates man from the earth, right?
3386000	3399000	And one of his daughter, Anoukis, puts Anoukhet in Egyptian, puts the Ankh into the nose of the people that are...
3399000	3406000	So that's also very similar to the story in Genesis, of course, that moving life into the...
3406000	3410000	And so, yeah, we see a lot of that happening there as well.
3410000	3412000	Yeah, wow. That's so fascinating.
3412000	3417000	No, all right, so we establish who these people are and how important this was.
3417000	3424000	Now, this is something that I want to highlight because, as I mentioned, you would expect...
3424000	3431000	If we're looking at the timeline of what we're told, the tradition says, you know, Noah and Abraham and all this stuff, and David, they all predate this.
3431000	3435000	So, of course, they have to know. There has to be some knowledge of them in these texts, right?
3435000	3444000	But do we find Noah, Abraham? I know Noah. We find no Joseph or Jacob?
3444000	3448000	No. Again, not just in Elephantine. Not just Elephantine.
3448000	3455000	We find no onomasticon, meaning in the list of names for that period in anywhere.
3455000	3462000	None of the biblical names from the Pentateuch.
3462000	3467000	I mean, we have names like Nathan, for example, or Hosea and things like that.
3467000	3473000	We have names like that in Elephantine, but that does not show any knowledge of the Bible.
3473000	3479000	These are just names that were common at that time and continued being common later on and even today.
3480000	3499000	But names that are clearly biblical, like the names of the Twelve Tribes, for example, or the names of Aaron and Moses, or the names of the Patriarchs, none of these appear in the onomasticon until the early Hellenistic period.
3499000	3501000	Yeah, yeah, early Hellenistic period.
3501000	3507000	That is fascinating. Okay, I don't even know where to...
3507000	3514000	Well, I mean, I'll take it even further. I'll take it even further. That's relatively easy. Okay, the Pentateuch and all that.
3514000	3522000	But according to normal biblical chronology, Nehemiah came to Jerusalem in the mid-5th century.
3522000	3525000	With Ezra and Zerubabel, right? That's the story?
3525000	3531000	Well, yeah, people are debating who came first, Nehemiah or Ezra, etc., and Zerubabel, all of that.
3531000	3544000	I'm talking specifically about Nehemiah coming to Jerusalem in the mid-5th century and then becoming governor and ruling there for a while, going back to Babylon for a while,
3544000	3551000	and going back all of these decades, you know, past, and then going back to Jerusalem.
3551000	3567000	In 407 BCE, so about 40 years after, supposedly, Nehemiah came to Jerusalem, we have two drafts of a letter that was sent to Jerusalem by the people of Elephantine.
3567000	3574000	Okay, and they sent it to the governor of Judea and to the high priest in Jerusalem.
3574000	3583000	And so this governor in Judea was either the immediate successor of Nehemiah.
3583000	3595000	If we suppose that Nehemiah was a historical figure and that he was, and the biblical chronology is correct, then this governor that they are writing to is either the immediate successor of Nehemiah or maybe, you know,
3595000	3603000	the successor of the immediate successor, because we don't know how long the successor, I mean, we don't know exactly what the list of governor was.
3603000	3613000	But it was, but Nehemiah was clearly still in living memory in 407 BCE, if the biblical chronology, the accepted biblical chronology is to be trusted.
3613000	3617000	Now, what are they asking for in 407 BCE at Elephantine?
3617000	3630000	They are asking the Persian authorities or the representative of the Persian authorities in Jerusalem to help them or to authorize the rebuilding of the temple that was destroyed at Elephantine,
3630000	3636000	to authorize to them the same thing that basically they authorized Nehemiah to do, right?
3636000	3649000	I mean, they're asking, the people of Elephantine are asking the same thing that according to the Bible was allowed to Nehemiah, but they don't mention Nehemiah.
3649000	3651000	See what I'm saying?
3651000	3654000	It's as if they don't know, I mean, they're talking about their temple.
3654000	3668000	They explain it in great detail how it was destroyed in really great detail, very similar in a sense, although without any knowledge of the description at the end of the Second Book of Kings,
3668000	3673000	of the destruction of the so-called Second Temple in Jerusalem.
3673000	3676000	And they get into a lot of detail.
3676000	3685000	They talk about how their own temple was built before the Persian conquest and it was left intact even under the Persian conquest date.
3685000	3691000	So they have no problem going into the past to provide precedence to their case.
3691000	3699000	They have no problem giving a lot of detail, but they don't mention an almost identical case to their own.
3699000	3703000	That was supposedly happened only a couple of decades, a few decades earlier, right?
3703000	3713000	Now, if you are making your case to the Persian authorities and asking them to help rebuild your temple,
3713000	3721000	you would either say, I want you to do to us as you did with Nehemiah, as you did with Jerusalem, I'm asking you to do with us.
3721000	3723000	That would really help your case.
3723000	3732000	Or if we want to just be devil's advocate here, let's assume that in actual historical reality,
3732000	3746000	the whole story with Nehemiah didn't work well and they simply didn't want to remind the Persian authorities of some problems that they had with the rebuilding of the temple.
3747000	3753000	You would at least would need to explain why you would be different, but you can't ignore it, right?
3753000	3758000	So the fact that they simply don't mention it, I think is significant.
3758000	3772000	And it shows that there is a very high probability that Nehemiah either did not exist in history or should be dated to the fourth century rather than the fifth century.
3772000	3778000	I mean, the implications for my elephantine are not just with regards to the Pentateuch or Moses and things like that,
3778000	3783000	but also with regards to texts that are dated to the fifth century, Ezra Nehemiah and etc.
3783000	3797000	I get told by scholars all the time that be careful using elephantine to draw a holistic conclusion on the period because they're just some fringe people over there.
3797000	3799000	What would you say to something like that?
3799000	3802000	Well, I mean, we should be careful always with the data.
3802000	3808000	So that's a very valid point, a very important point that I repeat constantly.
3808000	3812000	The prism of elephantine is not everything, it's certainly not everything.
3812000	3827000	And that's why I always look at other places, so I compare elephantine to other places in Egypt or if possible, or to other locations in the provinces of Samaria or in Babylonia.
3827000	3831000	And very often you will find a lot of symmetry.
3831000	3837000	So I look at all of the data that I can and I only reach decisions when I do that.
3837000	3839000	I don't only rely on elephantine.
3839000	3841000	So that's a very valid point.
3841000	3849000	So yeah, so it's true, we shouldn't, but at the same time there is no counter example.
3849000	3852000	That's what I'm saying, like what else do you do?
3852000	3854000	How else do you test the data?
3854000	3858000	The Bible, the Bible is simply not a reliable historical source.
3858000	3860000	We need to understand this.
3860000	3866000	The Bible, I, you know, often people ask me also, well, well, you accept Herodotus and why wouldn't you accept the Bible?
3866000	3867000	What's the difference?
3867000	3869000	Now, it's true.
3869000	3874000	First of all, I have to say, don't accept Herodotus, you know, blind.
3874000	3881000	Yeah, I always examine it with exactly the same kind of skepticism that we do with the Bible.
3881000	3883000	But let me say something on Herodotus.
3883000	3885000	People are citing Herodotus right away.
3885000	3893000	Or even like, for example, Homer, Homer's Iliad, we have Nestor's cup and it quotes Homer on the cup.
3893000	3895000	And it's dated to 750 BC.
3895000	3900000	So we're like, all right, we can put Homer in that time period at least to some degree, maybe not the form that we happen.
3900000	3905000	But you don't find, there's not like a Moses cup where it cites the words of...
3905000	3909000	There's nothing from the Bible at all, nothing from the Bible.
3909000	3911000	Now, they have no problem citing other things.
3911000	3917000	And they had, for example, the Wisdom of Ahikar, which was a very famous book, and they did have that.
3917000	3918000	We did find that at the telephony.
3918000	3924000	They had a copy or a version of the B. Sotun or B. Student Inscription in Aramaic.
3924000	3926000	So they had literary texts.
3926000	3927000	They had no problem with that.
3927000	3930000	They just didn't have the Bible or any quotes of the Bible.
3930000	3932000	They didn't use a geometric expressions from the Bible.
3932000	3935000	They write, they are being persecuted.
3935000	3936000	So that's really important.
3936000	3946000	In, from around, you know, around 415-ish BCE to when their temple was destroyed in 410 BCE.
3946000	3953000	But they were persecuted, again, not for cultic reasons, for political reasons.
3953000	3957000	But they were persecuted for a while, for several years.
3957000	3959000	And then their temple is destroyed.
3959000	3964000	They write to the governor and the high priest in Jerusalem, by the way, and in Samaria.
3964000	3972000	So both in Jerusalem and in Samaria and the high priest, they write to them, to their co-religionists, without any mention.
3972000	3977000	I mean, these are Jews persecuted in Egypt, writing to their co-religionists in Judea.
3977000	3982000	Not a word about the Exodus, about Moses, about something.
3982000	3991000	I mean, again, you would, that's pretty, again, every, every, every story, every element like that,
3992000	3993000	can be explained away.
3993000	3995000	You can say, well, maybe they didn't want to go into that.
3995000	3999000	You can explain everyone independently and excuse it all.
3999000	4004000	But the, but the overall picture is there is not a single counter example.
4004000	4005000	Right.
4005000	4010000	So again, yeah, you can excuse all of these, everything that I'm saying inside.
4010000	4012000	Well, maybe they didn't want to do this.
4012000	4014000	Maybe they knew about it, but they, they ignored it.
4014000	4019000	You can explain that, but give me one counter example, one counter example.
4019000	4020000	There is none.
4020000	4022000	And this is such a good point.
4022000	4029000	And, but even, let's try to explain what do we, so what are they worshiping?
4029000	4031000	Are they just worshiping Yahoo?
4031000	4032000	Or is there other gods?
4032000	4033000	Other gods, definitely.
4033000	4034000	Yeah.
4034000	4035000	Other gods.
4035000	4039000	Can we tell us about what their, their, so they're straight up polytheistic.
4039000	4041000	There's no question about that, right?
4041000	4046000	Again, another term that I'm not, not, not, not, as you know.
4046000	4049000	The term is polytheistic, they're so pro, I agree with you.
4049000	4052000	But just for people who understand these terms.
4052000	4053000	Right.
4053000	4056000	They are not, there is no monotheism in the ancient world.
4056000	4060000	I mean, strict monotheism in the ancient world at all.
4060000	4062000	It wasn't even a concern.
4062000	4067000	It wasn't, I mean, and, and strict monotheism, by the way, is an Islamic innovation.
4067000	4073000	Really the Tauhi, the, the, this uniqueness of, of, of God and absolute monotheism is
4073000	4075000	an Islamic innovation.
4076000	4082000	And so, but, but what they had at Elephantine.
4082000	4088000	So, so their main ethnic deity, the deity that you find in many of, not all of their
4088000	4090000	personal names is Yahweh.
4090000	4095000	And the temple that they built, and they certainly invested a lot of resources into
4095000	4097000	building is the temple for Yahweh.
4097000	4101000	And they also claim that Yahweh dwells in Elephantine.
4101000	4104000	Literally he dwells at Elephantine.
4105000	4106000	You don't hear that.
4106000	4107000	I've never heard that before.
4107000	4108000	That's something.
4108000	4109000	But they, they literally say that.
4109000	4115000	And so they don't say he doesn't dwell in Jerusalem or in Mount Gerizim or, you know,
4115000	4119000	in other places, but they say he does dwell there at Elephantine.
4119000	4123000	Now, and sir, again, the temple is a very, I mean, the temple was, you know, with
4123000	4127000	cedar wood ceilings and bronze in doors and stone.
4127000	4132000	I mean, it was a very sumptuous temple.
4133000	4140000	And, and so that their main deity, certainly the main ethnic deity was Yahweh.
4140000	4146000	But they also make oaths, take oaths in the names of other deities.
4146000	4153000	They also say that, that, that Khnum is against them is attacking them because of
4153000	4154000	something that happened.
4154000	4156000	He's like us Satan.
4156000	4157000	Right.
4157000	4158000	Right.
4158000	4159000	Right.
4159000	4166000	And also very interesting really in the last year or two of their time on the island.
4166000	4171000	We have a fascinating document again in this article that I have on in the
4171000	4176000	in the Kemeny period, I go into detail on this.
4176000	4182000	There's a, there's a fascinating papyrus long papyrus of contributions that the
4182000	4187000	Yahweh's on Elephantine make two shekels, two shekels, two shekels.
4187000	4189000	They are making contributions.
4189000	4190000	It begins with these.
4190000	4193000	This is the contribution for Yahoo.
4193000	4199000	And at the end, after all the accounting is done of all of the, the contributions,
4199000	4204000	you have a list of the monies that were, I'm just translating in my head, but the
4204000	4210000	monies that were collected on this day to Yahweh, Anatbet El and Eshimet El.
4210000	4212000	So there's a triad.
4212000	4215000	They begin the document with saying this is for Yahoo.
4215000	4220000	But at the end, they say this amount of money goes to Eshimet El.
4220000	4222000	This amount of money goes to Yahoo.
4222000	4225000	This amount of money goes to Anatbet El.
4225000	4229000	And in Eshimet El and Yahoo, we get almost exactly the same amount.
4229000	4231000	I mean, very, very small difference between the two.
4231000	4233000	Yahoo gets a little bit more.
4233000	4238000	But Eshimet El, and there's a discussion, whether it's a feminine deity or a masculine
4238000	4242000	deity, Anatbet El is clearly a feminine deity.
4242000	4246000	But this is a triad, a Yahwistic triad.
4246000	4253000	And interestingly, two of those deities are really dyads because Eshimet El is Eshimet
4253000	4256000	El and Anatbet El is Anatbet El.
4256000	4263000	So you have three or five different deities that are receiving significant contributions
4263000	4265000	from the Yahwists.
4265000	4268000	These are all people, are mostly people with Yahwistic names.
4268000	4271000	By the way, there were Yahwists that had Egyptian names.
4272000	4275000	So we have, or even Persian names.
4275000	4284000	So if the name is Yahwistic, it clearly shows that the person was most probably a Yahwist.
4284000	4290000	But we also have clearly Yahwists who take on Egyptian names.
4290000	4295000	We have people with Egyptian names who give their sons and daughters Yahwistic names.
4295000	4301000	We have a Yahwist who gives his son a Beth El name rather than Yahw.
4301000	4309000	So they had, now around 420 BCE, there was some kind of reform on the island.
4309000	4312000	Very clear reform that changed.
4312000	4321000	I mean, this community has one form before 420 BCE and another form after 420 BCE.
4322000	4325000	Yeah, and so there was clearly a reform.
4325000	4329000	I won't get into that because that will probably add another hour to the discussion.
4329000	4341000	But there was clearly a reform that, but in any, in that reform got them a lot closer to the Persian slash Achaemenidz or Astrion or really early Zoroastrian format.
4341000	4343000	Really interesting.
4344000	4354000	That is again, one of my article on the Incapitatsu Udaika goes in a lot of detail on that is that they say when they talk about the destruction of their temple.
4354000	4363000	One of the documents, they have several documents talking, describing it, but one of the documents talks about a, it says that they brought an offering to Yahweh.
4363000	4365000	I mean, it's very fragmentary.
4365000	4370000	And the line under this, under that says that one Atrodan, that they had an Atrodan there.
4370000	4378000	Now, Atrodan is in today in Zoroastrian name is in Atashdan in just a different format.
4378000	4383000	But that is the fire holder of Zoroastrian cult.
4383000	4388000	So in their temple, in the Yahweh's temple, they had a fire holder.
4388000	4390000	Is that an invest in term that you just used?
4390000	4391000	Yeah, it's an invest in term.
4391000	4393000	That's not a somatic thing.
4393000	4394000	That's an invest in thing.
4394000	4395000	Absolutely. Absolutely.
4395000	4396000	Wow.
4396000	4402000	Now, I've had people say, and this is in my article that is in the book that we're talking about.
4402000	4406000	My paper in that book, it goes into a lot of detail on this.
4406000	4410000	And some people say, well, you know, it's a fire holder.
4410000	4414000	A lot of people translate it as a fire altar.
4414000	4418000	I don't use the term fire altar because it is not an altar.
4418000	4419000	It is a holder.
4419000	4422000	There's nothing to sacrifice or offered on it.
4422000	4425000	Zoroastrians don't offer anything on this.
4425000	4430000	Yeah, but this is exactly what the Zoroastrians are using to worship.
4430000	4434000	They're not worshiping the fire, but they're using the fire.
4434000	4435000	That's right.
4435000	4439000	That is the center of the Yasna, the Zoroastrian cult.
4439000	4447000	So they had this and they use, I mean, if they wanted to just simply say we have something that holds fire,
4447000	4451000	not necessarily Zoroastrian, but something that holds fire in the temple,
4451000	4455000	they could have used the Aramaic, Duda de Noura or something like that in Aramaic.
4455000	4457000	But they used the Avestan term.
4457000	4465000	The technical cultic term, the Avestan term in that to describe what they have.
4465000	4470000	So the level of assimilation is there.
4470000	4478000	I mean, when you have in your own temple a Zoroastrian fire holder and you are using that term,
4478000	4483000	that cultic term, you know what you're doing when you're using this technical term.
4483000	4489000	Again, if they just wanted to say we have something that holds fire, it's very easy to say it in Aramaic.
4489000	4491000	It's really easy.
4491000	4499000	And in fact, in the Talmud where they lived in Sasanian times and they live among Zoroastrians,
4499000	4506000	they had no problem talking about the fire temple, Bid Noura or Bid Noura.
4506000	4513000	So they have no problem using pure Aramaic to describe what it is without using a Vestan term.
4513000	4516000	And Aramaic is the imperial...
4516000	4518000	Oh, it's a Vestan slash Persian.
4518000	4523000	It's not purely, I mean, the Atar of Dan is in the Vestan or really Iranian term.
4523000	4529000	But in any case, it's an Indo-Iranian term that is of course also very frequent in the Avesta.
4529000	4530000	Wow.
4530000	4535000	Imperial Aramaic is the imperial tongue of the Persians.
4535000	4537000	I'm mistaken, right?
4537000	4538000	It's the imperial tongue.
4538000	4540000	I mean, it's the lingua franca of the day.
4540000	4542000	It's not a Persian language.
4542000	4547000	But Persians and Aramaic have a very long story, history together.
4547000	4552000	I mean, Middle Persian, of course, takes a lot of the...
4552000	4556000	And that kind of explains why Cyrus the Great is considered to be the messiah
4556000	4561000	in some of these later texts that come in the Hellenistic or Persian period, maybe.
4561000	4562000	Right?
4562000	4565000	Is that what you would date Isaiah to, a Persian period text?
4565000	4566000	What would you say about that?
4566000	4567000	Or who knows, right?
4567000	4568000	It's really who knows.
4568000	4575000	I mean, the Cyrus's renown and his...
4575000	4579000	I mean, you know that Alexander the Great revered Cyrus.
4579000	4580000	Yes.
4580000	4587000	And so the fact that someone makes a big deal out of Cyrus does not help date this.
4587000	4593000	I mean, you can have Cyrus as a big name centuries later.
4593000	4595000	So that doesn't really help.
4595000	4604000	The question here I would ask as a historian is who has the interest in introducing Cyrus as a messiah?
4604000	4608000	What was the reason to do that?
4608000	4612000	That makes sense for a Persian period thing though, right?
4612000	4613000	No, not just.
4613000	4616000	I mean, Cyrus had it was very popular also in Hellenistic times.
4616000	4617000	So...
4617000	4619000	Yeah, it's hard to say.
4619000	4620000	It's hard to say.
4620000	4622000	You know, I don't want to focus too much on that part.
4622000	4625000	I wanted it because I wanted to ask you and I don't want to get too far off.
4625000	4632000	I wanted to ask you, is this just an elephantine's yahoo temple where they're using the fire?
4632000	4634000	Or is this also in Samaria?
4634000	4636000	Well, excellent question.
4636000	4637000	We don't know.
4637000	4641000	I mean, we know there's only one mention of this fire holder at Elephantine.
4641000	4642000	Fascinating.
4642000	4644000	I mean, the context is really clear.
4644000	4645000	It's the temple.
4645000	4650000	It's also with, you know, in the context of offerings and things like that.
4650000	4656000	It's a fascinating little, but it's very fragmentary, but it does appear very clearly in that fragment.
4656000	4663000	But we don't have, you know, I, my, again, it's purely speculative.
4663000	4671000	But I do think that 420 BCE was a watershed moment in the relationship between the Persian Empire,
4671000	4677000	the Achaemenid Empire, and the Yahoists all across the empire.
4677000	4683000	Now, when I started looking into that, I said, well, we see it very clearly at Elephantine.
4683000	4688000	We really see after post 420, which is Darius II.
4688000	4694000	So post 420, we see a major shift and a lot more assimilation with Persian ideals, Persian ideas,
4694000	4700000	and even going to the, to a really extreme measure, extreme in our eyes,
4700000	4708000	but a very significant measure of having a fire holder within the temple to Yahweh at Elephantine.
4708000	4713000	So, and that must have been because it's a relationship with the Yahoists and the empire.
4713000	4717000	That must have been true of all Yahoists everywhere.
4717000	4727000	Now, if you dig a little bit deeper, the, the temple complex at on Mount Gerazi, which was also Yahoistic, of course,
4727000	4732000	was constructed around that time, depending on who you talk to.
4732000	4733000	Some people, David.
4733000	4741000	So the likelihood of it, if it's built around the same time, the likelihood of it having similar features is a lot higher, right?
4741000	4745000	Well, I'm not talking about the architecture because the architecture was certainly different.
4745000	4751000	But what I'm saying is that there is an investment because building a temple like this requires imperial, of course,
4751000	4754000	authorization and investment.
4754000	4763000	And so the empire not only, so at that, around that time of the 420 reform, 420 BC reform that is documented very clearly at Elephantine,
4763000	4772000	we see that the temple in on Mount Gerazi is being sponsored, so to speak, by, by the, the Achaemenid Empire.
4772000	4782000	And a lot of scholars, and I agree with that, claim that the temple in Jerusalem was also built at that time.
4782000	4790000	This is why throughout our talk today, I said so-called second temple because these terms are very misleading.
4790000	4797000	The first temple is simply the first temple that the Bible acknowledges or the Bible talks about.
4797000	4803000	Clearly, I mean, you know, we know that Jerusalem was an important city over also in the El Amarna period.
4803000	4807000	There was certainly some temple there, although not the autistic.
4807000	4814000	And certainly there continued to be temples there even after the Bronze Age collapsed and later on.
4814000	4817000	Because there is no city without a temple in the ancient world.
4817000	4819000	Simply, there must have been a temple.
4819000	4827000	You can't, even if it's under the, you know, even if it's under the sky, but there's some sacred space within the city.
4827000	4832000	Okay, so there's, I mean, in the ancient world, it's completely inconceivable to have a city without some kind of temple.
4832000	4836000	A city would simply be not protected if it didn't have a deity protecting it.
4836000	4840000	So the concept of a city without a temple is important.
4840000	4843000	So there was some kind of temple.
4843000	4850000	And so the whole concept of a first temple is not historical.
4850000	4852000	I mean, the concept of a first temple.
4852000	4857000	There was a temple, whether there was the Solomonic, whether it was a historical Solomon is not a question.
4857000	4864000	Whether this one is a, whether he actually constructed the temple is yet another.
4864000	4867000	But let's say there's this, we call that the first temple.
4867000	4869000	Then what is the second temple?
4869000	4877000	When was a, when was another sacred area built or accepted in Jerusalem?
4877000	4886000	The normal chronology says 516 BCE, according to the chronology that's suggested in the Bible.
4886000	4895000	But that's, that date is simply there in order to provide a 70 year gap between 586 and 560.
4895000	4897000	I need that to happen.
4897000	4898000	Yeah, exactly.
4898000	4902000	So you need to have the 70 years because that's, you know, prophecy.
4902000	4905000	And so that is not established.
4905000	4906000	That's not historical.
4906000	4911000	If I'm looking it against scientifically, I cannot take that as a historical fact.
4911000	4922000	And, and then clearly there was something that was built with someone at the time, a Nehemiah or someone like that somewhere in the fifth century.
4922000	4938000	And we know from archaeology that in on Mount Gerizim, which was as Yahuistic as Jerusalem was, there was no difference in terms of authority between, and we do find, we also find the Judeans offering, making offerings on Mount Gerizim.
4939000	4949000	So Mount Gerizim was a completely legitimate temple for Yahuists at the time, not less than, not less so the Jerusalem.
4949000	4954000	And there was also definitely a Yahuistic temple also in the town of Samaria as well.
4954000	4960000	We talk about this in the book that we are, the book of the, that we're actually talking about, supposed to be talking about here.
4960000	4968000	There's also articles that talk about that refer to Samaria and the cultic context in Samaria at the time as well, and they came in the period.
4968000	4973000	So, yeah, so this, we're talking about a very complex picture at the time.
4973000	4989000	And, and we start seeing towards the end of the fifth century BC again, there are people who date the construction of the Mount Gerizim temple to the mid fifth century, based on mostly on coins and things like that have been found.
4989000	4996000	Coins are not enough to date because you can have a coin that comes from an earlier period.
4996000	5005000	Simply, there's no reason to switch to a new type of coin so long as the weight of the coin doesn't change.
5005000	5008000	So people use coins for a long period of time even after they were issued.
5008000	5018000	So that's not a, these are not good reasons, but I think there are much better reasons to date it to the sec, to the last quarter of the fifth century.
5018000	5037000	And that fits, you know, this Persian support for the, for the Yahweh's and probably the temple in Jerusalem was built in this at the same time, as part of the same, this same policy towards the Yahweh's around the same time.
5037000	5041000	Now then, and then you have Herod's temple, right?
5041000	5043000	Is that the third temple?
5043000	5046000	You know, if you're talking about the second temple, is that the third?
5046000	5051000	I've always asked that. I've always, I've always said that too. How do you, and that's funded by justice.
5051000	5059000	Yeah, so this, this, this terminology of second temple, first temple, this is completely, it's not a scientific, you know, it's not a scientific terminology.
5059000	5067000	Yeah, yeah. Now, when I first encountered you on the internet, there was, it was actually, this is what, I'll just say what happened, tell the story real quick.
5067000	5077000	Dan McClellan retweeted a post about the elephantine community was just like the Israelites, they had a Passover and everything.
5077000	5081000	And I, and I saw this and I just thought to myself, this is so misleading.
5081000	5089000	And I started, so I went in there keyboard warrior style, wait a minute, they don't even mention Abraham, there's no Moses, there's no Noah, there's no Jacob.
5089000	5091000	I was like, what are you talking about?
5091000	5095000	And I didn't even know that there was a Passover. And then they were like, oh, here's where it says Passover.
5095000	5102000	And it's talking about the letter from 419 from people saying that Darius is allowing us to have a Passover.
5102000	5110000	And then you came in and said, wait a minute, not so fast. It's not the Passover you think the Pesach is being used in a different way.
5110000	5115000	So explain what you meant by this Passover letter is not what people think.
5115000	5119000	Right, right. Well, that's, that's a huge topic. I'll try to make it short.
5119000	5129000	So the term Pasha, or, you know, the Pesach in Aramaic is mentioned early in the fifth century.
5129000	5137000	So if we're talking about this 420 BCE document that's erroneously called the Passover letter, that's much later, right?
5137000	5147000	But the term Pasha, this term that is a cognate term to the Hebrew Pesach appears already early in the fifth century BCE in Elephantine.
5147000	5159000	But the problem is that the contexts are not remotely related to what we know of the biblical Pesach.
5159000	5168000	So first of all, it appears only in two slash two and a half Ostraca in all of the Elephantine records.
5168000	5175000	Either way, real quick, this is all the way at the end of the period too. We're talking 419, but they've already been there for 100 some years.
5175000	5181000	Yeah, but also the term Pesach has been there already from the beginning of the fifth century. It's something else.
5181000	5197000	And in these two and a half Ostraca, the reason I saying half is that there is another Ostracon that I'm, I refer to in a different article that has a word that combines Pesach with another word.
5197000	5202000	That's a different story. Let's focus on these two Ostraca that mentioned Pesach.
5202000	5215000	Clearly, I mean, there is another Ostraca where people suggest that it might because it has a pay, a paying people complete this as best as I don't, I don't, because it's too speculative, I don't really deal with that.
5215000	5223000	But there are two Ostraca where it's clearly, it clearly uses the term Pasha. The first one is a very short Ostracon.
5223000	5229000	I mean, the first one is very short. The second one is actually a very long Ostracon relatively speaking.
5229000	5241000	But the first Ostracon talks about the, about the family, about children being in some kind of danger and the person writing the Ostracon says, keep a close eye on the children.
5241000	5249000	Don't leave them out. Let them out of your sight until their mother comes. Need the bread until the mother comes. Let and send the news of the children.
5249000	5260000	There's a lot of anxiety in that Ostracon. Clearly the children are in some kind of danger. Maybe there's some kind of epidemic at the time or whatever.
5260000	5267000	There's a lot of anxiety. And then at the end he says, tell me when you're doing the Pesach, the Pasha. Let me know.
5267000	5278000	Now, the biblical Pasha is one event for which you can never ask when is it going to happen because it's always in the same, the night of the 14th of Nisan.
5278000	5285000	And it's always in the, when the, in sunset, between the evenings, as we mentioned, right?
5285000	5291000	So the time between the sun starts to set and the time when it's completely set.
5291000	5301000	So the fact that they ask, tell me when you're going to do the Pesach means that it's not set. It's not fixed.
5301000	5303000	I didn't even think about that. That was a good point.
5303000	5311000	And by the way, and by the way, real quick, they already have the, from, to my knowledge, I did some research in this for a video I was working on.
5311000	5324000	And there, they already are tons of festivals throughout times in the Assyrian period, the Persian period that celebrates some sort of agricultural rebirth of the sun, New Year festival at this time.
5324000	5327000	And it's usually right around the Nisan 14 day.
5327000	5334000	Correct. Absolutely. No, the Nisan 14th. So just to finish with the Ostraca, the Ostraca are not related to any specific dates.
5334000	5336000	So it's not Nisan 14th or anything like that.
5336000	5341000	They're simply not, it was a completely movable, you know, ritual.
5341000	5356000	And it was probably in the Potropaic ritual, meaning it's something that basically, you know, how to fight evil, how to form exorcism, if you will, or a Potropaic ritual to,
5356000	5361000	and we have actually an echo of that even in the Bible.
5361000	5376000	In Exodus chapter 12, it says that the, quote unquote, original Pesach was when you put the blood on the entrance to the, you know, to the building, to the house to make sure that the evil does not come in.
5376000	5384000	That is probably the biblical echo of how this Pesach was actually performed.
5384000	5392000	It was basically a ritual that was performed whenever you wanted to make sure that evil does not enter your home.
5392000	5394000	Okay.
5394000	5406000	And so, again, it's even echoed in the Bible, and it was probably the thing that they did in order to save those children that they mentioned in the Ostracon that were under some kind of danger.
5406000	5414000	I have an article that is about to come out on another Ostracon that mentions Pesach, also a very anxious situation.
5414000	5422000	People are very anxious about some people who are coming to Aswan, to the city that is facing Elephantine.
5422000	5431000	Elephantine is mentioned in, I mean, the context is also in Elephantine there, and they mentioned the Pesach.
5431000	5437000	We don't really know, it's too fragmentary, the area that mentions where the word Pesach appears, so we don't know exactly what they mean by that.
5437000	5448000	But it is the same context of high anxiety, something that is, I mean, before the text on this Ostracon prior to the word Pesach appears,
5448000	5458000	is this some kind of letter that they receive, and they really, really need to understand it well, so they send it to some other person to explain it,
5458000	5462000	and then they send it to another person to explain it, and they really need to understand what's going on,
5462000	5472000	because some really important people are going to come to Aswan on that day, and so there's a clear sense of anxiety, and again the word Pesach appears.
5472000	5484000	So my sense is that Pesach, in the beginning of the first century, Pesach has nothing to do with the use of its biblical cognate,
5485000	5496000	but it's simply some ritual that was enacted to combat evil, to make sure that evil does not attack you, does not...
5496000	5500000	So that's, and again, it's echoed in the Bible as well.
5500000	5511000	The Passover is a debatable etymology, but the idea that this is something that you put blood on the entrance to your home to make sure that evil does not come in,
5511000	5517000	that seems to be the actual original ceremony that was not fixed in time.
5517000	5528000	And this letter from 419, coming from the Jews under Darius, doesn't say anything about a lamb, or...
5528000	5530000	It doesn't use the term Pesach, Pesach.
5530000	5534000	It doesn't even use the word Passover, they call it a Passover letter, but it doesn't even use the word Passover.
5534000	5539000	It doesn't use the word Passover, or Matzah, or Matzot, you know, or Unliving Bread.
5539000	5542000	Oh, it doesn't mention Unliving Bread? I thought it did, doesn't it?
5542000	5543000	No, it doesn't.
5543000	5545000	So there, there's assuming that it does.
5545000	5548000	You're right. I mean, that's just the restoration that was done.
5548000	5551000	Ah, see, this is blowing my mind.
5551000	5555000	So, all right, so to wrap this all up, this is crazy.
5555000	5558000	Let me actually go a little bit further.
5558000	5576000	So my, my chapter in this book that we're talking about goes into is a very detailed epigraphic analysis of this papyrus, so-called Passover letter.
5576000	5585000	Again, a very erroneously called the Passover letter, but I'm providing a very detailed epigraphic analysis line by line, word by word.
5585000	5590000	And also, then I provide the context that I think it really should reflect.
5590000	5596000	Now, what's really interesting is that if we remove all of the proposed reconstructions.
5596000	5607000	I mean, Zachau, the German scholar from the, who published it initially in 1903, the first one to publish this papyrus.
5607000	5614000	He said that he was able to reconstruct this to understand this papyrus based on Deuteronomy in Exodus.
5614000	5618000	That methodologically is unacceptable to us today.
5618000	5621000	I mean, this is one of the great scholars of the beginning of the 20th century.
5621000	5629000	But today, if someone would tell me, I was able to restore this based on Deuteronomy in Exodus, I have a methodological problem with that.
5629000	5635000	You can't do that, right? You have to establish first that there was such a thing as the Passover in the 15th century this year.
5635000	5637000	Or that there was a Deuteronomy.
5637000	5638000	Or there was exactly.
5638000	5641000	Because no one's mentioning, no one ever mentions Deuteronomy ever until-
5641000	5643000	That's right. That's right.
5643000	5656000	And so, but not only is Passover not mentioned or unleavened bread, but there are no prohibitions on anything at all.
5656000	5666000	Okay, in the reconstructions that certain scholars have done over the years, they restore, do not eat, do not drink, right?
5666000	5668000	But it's only, it's only restoration.
5668000	5684000	The actual papyrus, and I did go to Berlin and studied it in person, you know, and took microscopic, I mean, microscopic infrared photo and multi-spectral photos of each word independently in and studied it.
5684000	5688000	They made sure that I'm reading this as scientifically as possible.
5688000	5691000	There is simply no pro, nothing is prohibited.
5691000	5693000	There is no do not eat, do not drink.
5693000	5697000	But drinking is very central to that document.
5697000	5704000	Drinking something, and it says be pure, keep yourselves pure.
5704000	5709000	He does not describe what he means by be pure, by the way, which is really important.
5709000	5712000	So clearly they understood what he meant.
5712000	5719000	The person writing this extremely important document is called Hananya.
5719000	5723000	And they clearly understood what he meant by being pure.
5723000	5725000	He didn't have to explain to them what that means.
5725000	5729000	And then in the next line after that, he says drink something.
5729000	5731000	He doesn't say don't drink.
5731000	5736000	He says drink something and then, you know, continues with it.
5736000	5743000	But so clearly there was something really important about drinking something on that document.
5743000	5749000	Again, I make all kinds of proposals in my...
5749000	5752000	Maybe the Haoma drink, right?
5752000	5755000	Okay, so you do know what I'm saying.
5755000	5761000	So yeah, my suggestion is that this was a Haoma drink.
5761000	5764000	The Yazna, so Yazna is the...
5764000	5768000	Real quick, just for anyone who has no idea what that is, what is the Haoma drink?
5768000	5772000	I mean, I'm not in any rush to finish as long as you're not.
5772000	5773000	Okay, great.
5773000	5780000	So the Yazna is the large Zoroastrian ritual.
5780000	5784000	Beautiful, impressive, fantastic.
5784000	5787000	I really recommend that people go and check.
5787000	5793000	There is a website called the Multimedia Yazna where you can actually see it in an interactive video
5793000	5797000	that was created by SOAS University in London.
5797000	5801000	Amazing project and a lot of information about the Yazna ceremony.
5801000	5804000	Yazna is not a festival.
5804000	5809000	It's kind of like a Catholic mass or Orthodox Christian mass.
5809000	5811000	It happens every day.
5811000	5816000	Every day there is a Yazna and it also happens for special occasions.
5816000	5821000	So it's simply the liturgy that happens constantly.
5821000	5825000	It's several hours long, by the way, in the Zoroastrian liturgy.
5825000	5827000	So that's the Yazna.
5827000	5836000	We know that the Yazna, so with the Passover, as we said, there is simply no records of it extra biblically.
5836000	5841000	But we do have records of the Yazna in the Achaemenid period.
5841000	5847000	Okay, we have pictographic representations in the Achaemenid period in Persepolis and other places
5847000	5857000	where, in several places across the empire, that show clearly that the Yazna was already practiced in the Achaemenid period.
5857000	5863000	So we have on one hand the Passover that is simply not documented anywhere,
5863000	5868000	or this Yazna which is amply documented in the Achaemenid period.
5868000	5873000	Now, in the pictographical presentations of the Yazna in the Achaemenid period,
5873000	5880000	we do have the preparation of the halma drink represented on these inscriptions,
5880000	5884000	which is a mortar and a pestle. That's how you press the halma.
5884000	5886000	Okay, that's how you make the halma drink.
5886000	5888000	That is a major part.
5888000	5891000	In the Yazna, it happens twice in the Yazna ceremony.
5891000	5895000	And that's what you make this drink, which is an intoxicating drink.
5895000	5898000	It doesn't make you drunk, but it's...
5898000	5903000	It's like the Kaikyan of the Greeks, but it's also like a soma for the Indians.
5903000	5905000	For the Indians, exactly.
5905000	5912000	And it has, I mean, in certain places it is repressed by wine, actually, because it's also pressed and also intoxicating.
5912000	5917000	And we see it also in China. I mean, there are also later communities in China.
5917000	5921000	Does it have psychedelic properties? I've heard that before. Do we not know?
5921000	5924000	We really don't know what exactly was the halma at the time.
5924000	5931000	What Zoroastrian or Hindus today use as the soma, it's probably a very different...
5931000	5936000	So we don't really know what it is that they actually used. It's also being debated.
5936000	5944000	But what we do know is that the Yawista community at Elephantine assimilated deeply.
5944000	5947000	I mean, we talked about the fire holder, right?
5947000	5953000	Deeply assimilated Zoroastrian elements into their own cultic sphere, right?
5953000	5968000	Now, this document that is erroneously called the Passover letter is much closer in what it describes to the halma, to the Yassna ceremony than to the...
5968000	5971000	Of course, to anything that we know from the Passover.
5971000	5983000	Now, the date, the only thing that the main reason that people refer to this as the Passover letter is because it refers to an observance that starts on the 15th of Disan and goes on for seven days.
5983000	5988000	Now, the thing is, the 14th of Disan is simply the first...
5988000	5997000	The 14th and the night between the 14th and the 15th of Disan is simply the first full moon of the year.
5997000	6001000	Disan is the beginning of the year and it's the first full moon of the year.
6001000	6005000	And it's the beginning, it's the sign for the beginning of the harvest.
6005000	6012000	So in the ancient world, the first full moon of the year was a major event.
6012000	6018000	In the ancient world, people need to understand because in the modern world, we don't understand just how precarious life was.
6018000	6025000	But in the ancient world, you live or die based on the results of the harvest, of just how much you got from the harvest.
6025000	6027000	It keeps you alive for the next year.
6027000	6043000	Now, if in the end, towards the end of Disan and that time period of spring, when the harvest begins, if your deity rains hail or floods or thunderstorms,
6043000	6046000	all of that, that can literally kill you.
6046000	6050000	That could destroy families, could destroy villages.
6050000	6053000	And so that period was extremely important.
6053000	6059000	And the first full moon of the year in Disan was a period of trepidation.
6059000	6068000	You're really concerned, you're worried about the immediate future and you want to make sure that this harvest is important.
6068000	6076000	So all across the ancient Near East, the 14th of Disan was a major, major date.
6076000	6080000	Let me just, let me just, so people whom you might not understand.
6080000	6084000	So 14 days after Nisan won, which is a lunar calendar.
6084000	6087000	So the first of Nisan would be a new moon.
6087000	6089000	14 days later would be the first full moon.
6089000	6091000	Is that how we would do it?
6091000	6095000	And so no matter what the situation is, we have a solar calendar.
6095000	6102000	So our calendars sort of just are like automatic every 12 months and 365 days in a year.
6102000	6109000	But they had to tune their calendars to line up with the moon so that on the first of every month would be a new moon.
6109000	6112000	So it's really lunar solar calendar.
6112000	6117000	You know, you adjust it with the sun and it's a lot more complicated.
6117000	6121000	It's more complex, but it served its purpose, certainly in the ancient world.
6121000	6126000	Calendars in the ancient world is another fascinating topic.
6126000	6128000	And Nisan was the first month?
6128000	6130000	The first month of the year, right.
6130000	6131000	Here we go.
6131000	6134000	So Nisan 14, by the way, that's the day Jesus crucified on.
6134000	6138000	Nisan 14 happens to be the first full moon of the year.
6138000	6139000	Wow.
6139000	6142000	It is every year the first full moon of the year.
6142000	6144000	And it is the beginning of the harvest.
6144000	6145000	Okay.
6145000	6156000	You know, and so, and so that, that is a major, really important day where people really did everything they can to make sure that the deities are not not angry with them.
6156000	6158000	The Assyrians had a big festival.
6158000	6160000	The Assyrians had called the Kisu Festival.
6160000	6162000	Huge festival was a week long.
6162000	6169000	And they sell, they actually did, I have an academic paper who wrote about this in my folder here.
6169000	6177000	And they had 72 gods under Dagon was the head of the Pantheon.
6177000	6181000	And they all got dedicated to them a lamb sacrifice.
6181000	6185000	So there is a lamb sacrifice happening in this time by the Assyrians.
6185000	6190000	Now the Persian period, I don't know if they did something different, but we're talking.
6190000	6192000	Let me just ask you this.
6192000	6202000	Do you think it's safe to say that whatever was going on in the Persian period for this festival was being adopted by Elephantines, Samaritans, all these different groups of people?
6202000	6205000	Well, it wasn't, it simply wasn't a festival yet.
6205000	6207000	It was a one-time observance.
6207000	6212000	You know, this happened in 419 BCE, this particular letter, really at the beginning.
6212000	6214000	So this is 420.
6214000	6220000	I mean, the letter was sent in the first two weeks of Nisan because he says, this year you should do this.
6220000	6228000	So he's, the year begins in the sun first, and he's talking about something that should happen on the sun 15th.
6228000	6235000	So clearly he's writing this somewhere in the first and the 15th of the same year.
6235000	6238000	What's the brand new observance that they're introducing?
6238000	6240000	Well, again, it's not necessarily an observance.
6240000	6252000	I think it's really a, the reason that they wanted to do that, because we already talked that there was some kind of, of close relationship between that started around 420 BCE, between the Achaemenid period.
6252000	6254000	And we talked about Mount Gerizim.
6254000	6257000	We talked about, you know, about the fire holder.
6257000	6261000	We talked about, you know, and we see it also in coins from that period.
6261000	6272000	There's a lot more, a lot of, that the imperial Achaemenids were started around 420 to be very close to the, to the Yahwehs at the time.
6272000	6290000	I think that this particular document is the document where, because in order to be close, to be promoted as a, as a, as a people group, as an ethnic group, to be promoted to be being part of the dominant ethnic class.
6291000	6293000	You have to be pure.
6295000	6300000	And in order to be pure, in the Zoroastrian view, in order to be pure, you drink the halma.
6301000	6306000	The halma purifies you cosmically, according to their, to their understanding.
6306000	6308000	It is, it really recreates you.
6308000	6310000	And Herodotus talks about this as well.
6311000	6325000	So, so I think that this, this document really describes their kind of a ceremony of becoming a part, an organic part, if you will, of the Achaemenid Empire, rather than anything related to the, to the Passover.
6325000	6334000	But I do think that the Passover decades later is based on the Zoroastrian Yassna.
6335000	6342000	And that was the first time it was kind of done and connected from to the dates of that festival.
6342000	6357000	But, but, you know, a ceremony is where you have pressed a drink made out of pressed, you know, natural ingredients that is also intoxicating and unleavened bread.
6357000	6361000	There are only two rituals that I know of that have that.
6362000	6366000	The Passover and the Zoroastrian Yassna.
6366000	6370000	So the Zoroastrian Yassna also has unleavened bread.
6370000	6371000	Yeah, I know.
6371000	6383000	I mentioned this in one of my recent videos about, I did a whole video about, you know, the spring equinox festivals, norus and yassna and quisu and Passover Easter.
6384000	6392000	And that was one of the things that I ran into in the, in the academic papers was that the unleavened bread was a big deal for the Persians.
6392000	6393000	That's right.
6393000	6398000	It is to this day, the Zoroastrian still have, we call it the drone, which just means a portion.
6398000	6405000	The drone initial in the Avesta drone is actually an animal sacrifice in the, in the Avesta.
6406000	6411000	But I think, and I think that I can also show it from archeological records in, in Persepolis.
6411000	6413000	That's a different story.
6413000	6424000	But I think that when the Zoroastrians became, had an M started having an empire, early Zoroastrianism with the Achaemenid Empire.
6424000	6428000	When you have, starts having Zoroastrians across the empire.
6428000	6441000	It becomes really just unmanageable to have them offer, you know, animal sacrifice everywhere they go, especially if you have an entire military of Zoroastrians that have to travel.
6441000	6448000	It really becomes, you know, extremely expensive and heavy to have animals for sacrifice travel with you.
6449000	6465000	And I think that the, that the shift from animal sacrifice in, and again, this is speculation, but it makes a lot of sense in imperial times to shift from animal sacrifice to an unleavened bread in the Achaemenid period rather than, than, than later on.
6465000	6477000	And I think this is also supported in, in some ways in, in Persepolis and in pictographic representation of the Yazna, because in the pictographic representations of the Yazna ritual.
6477000	6483000	As I said, you have the pestil and the mortar where you crush the, the Alma and make the drink.
6483000	6491000	You have a, you often have the sponsor of the ceremony represented and the, and the one of the priests represented there.
6491000	6507000	But you never have, it doesn't, it never shows like a head of an animal sacrificed or a, you know, some body part of an animal sacrifice, which you do have for in representations in other, in other cults.
6508000	6522000	So, so you don't, it never shows, shows that, I mean, sometimes there are, there are some cases where it does show that, but it, but in most cases in the main representations that we have, we don't see that.
6522000	6531000	And so I think that that was the period of transition from animal sacrifice, maybe in Persepolis, they still did animal sacrifice, but across the empire, they didn't.
6531000	6540000	So that was a period that makes a lot of sense for transition into, into a unleavened bread already in the Achaemenid period in Zoroastrianism.
6540000	6544000	Wow, we just covered so much in this is very fascinating.
6544000	6555000	So if I just wanted to run an idea by you and you can say if this would be accurate or not based on what you've concluded or based on your research.
6555000	6574000	If I was to say like what we consider to be Judaism today is actually just kind of an evolution of ideas starting back in the, you know, obviously, going back as far as we know, but progressing through the Persian period, and then even more so in the Hellenistic period when you start getting Bible.
6574000	6584000	Is that safe to say that it's not like the exact traditional account more of an evolution of ideas progressing?
6584000	6592000	Well, every, yeah, every cultic system, every religion is progression constant progression.
6592000	6599000	Yeah, and, and, and what's really important to understand is the, the Jews were never different from other systems.
6599000	6612000	And I mean, they were, I had this article, I don't know if you if you saw about this priestess in Elephantine that was also published, I mean, National Geographic to the thing about it as well.
6612000	6621000	And where I actually found evidence, clear evidence of a priestess serving in the Yahweh temple at Elephantine.
6621000	6626000	And fascinating little ostracon that, that I had to hunt down.
6626000	6638000	Anyway, so the, this, this, I mean, normally you would think that the that there was no priestesses, there were no priestesses in Judaism, it's only only male priests.
6638000	6642000	That's the image that you get from the biblical, most of the biblical text.
6642000	6644000	I mean, if you dig enough, you can see echoes.
6644000	6660000	We, there are, there were Jewish priestesses, not only in Elephantine, but also in Egypt, in the, in the second century, first century BCE, and then in Rome, in, I mean, there are priestesses, Jewish priestesses and many actual priestesses in Judaism as well.
6660000	6664000	But you never hear of that in the Bible.
6664000	6673000	Or, or directly in the Talmud, I mean, there are echoes that you might be able to interpret also there.
6673000	6680000	But many scholars say, well, what was unique about Judaism is that they did not have priestesses.
6680000	6688000	You read that many, many scholars say that they say everyone did, but the Jews didn't have female, you know, didn't have priestesses.
6688000	6690000	But they did.
6690000	6700000	You see what I'm saying? If we, if we only look at the biblical image, it gives us a completely distorted image of, of reality on the ground.
6700000	6708000	Because it's, these are, I mean, again, the Bible, I'm not, I'm not, I want to make sure that people understand I'm not against the Bible and not coming.
6708000	6718000	It's not, I'm not trying to, to, to, to, to, but, but we need to understand the Bible and going back to the point I was making earlier on about the Herodotus versus the Bible as a historical source.
6718000	6721000	Certainly very skeptical of a lot of what Herodotus says.
6721000	6731000	But the big difference between Herodotus and the Bible is that no one had his, his or her identity defined by Herodotus ever.
6731000	6734000	No one say I'm a Herodotian.
6734000	6739000	Okay, no one had to know it was not a defining text.
6739000	6743000	The Bible is, the Bible is defines your identity.
6743000	6752000	And so we have different sects, different schools of thought, each one inserting their own ideology into what eventually became the biblical text.
6752000	6756000	The Bible is this huge battleground of ideas.
6756000	6757000	Okay.
6757000	6762000	And it is, it's not concerned primarily or even secondarily with history.
6762000	6778000	It's concerned with, with expressing those ideas with expressing theological and mythological ideas on on how the, you know, going back to the Exodus that we talked about at the beginning.
6778000	6793000	The idea of a nation of a group of people of her ethnos coming from the East was central to Greco-Roman thought, Hellenistic and Greco-Roman thought.
6793000	6808000	If you wanted to represent your people, your, your, your, your ethnic background as something ancient, something, you know, respectable, something that is, that is, you know, that has a lot of long history behind it.
6808000	6815000	You would, in the ancient world, you would explain, you would provide some kind of mythology on how it came from the East.
6815000	6833000	This is true of the Greeks in some, some of the Greek poly nation states represented themselves as being founded by definitions coming from the East and found in them there, but also Rome, at one of the heights of its power,
6833000	6854000	Auguste commissioned, exactly. He commissioned Virgil to create the mythology of how Rome was, was founded by Aeneas from, from Troy, who traveled from the East to, and this is exactly the same idea with the, with the story of the patriarchs coming from Abraham and then having
6854000	6867000	each one of his children go back to the East and to bring a bride from the East and, and reestablish them. So coming from the East, this origin, this origin from the East is, is, is so Hellenistic.
6867000	6873000	The Heraklidae coming from the, the Lydians, they claim descent from Heracles.
6873000	6874000	That's right.
6874000	6877000	Edgibeton Thebes, they're from Cadmus, who's a Phoenician.
6877000	6878000	Cadmus, exactly Phoenician.
6878000	6879000	Yeah.
6879000	6882000	Yeah, they're all this, still claiming descent from some sort of demigod.
6882000	6883000	Yeah.
6883000	6886000	I mean, even the name Cadmus just means East, right?
6886000	6887000	Right.
6887000	6888000	Right.
6888000	6889000	Yeah.
6889000	6890000	Alphabet too.
6890000	6891000	Yeah, exactly.
6891000	6904000	But also this ties to the Exodus, this ties to the Exodus because, you know, the Exodus is, is taking this idea of, of a, of going from Egypt and then entering the land from the East, which makes no sense.
6904000	6914000	I mean, they enter, they go all around from Moab and, you know, in, in, in Edom and they have to go and enter from the East.
6914000	6923000	Again, the same kind of meeting the same, the same place around Shechem, where, where Abraham entered the land as well.
6923000	6933000	So, so you see that there's a, there are two narratives of how the people came from the East, one from the patriarch, one from the, the root of the Exodus.
6933000	6943000	All of this is perfectly aligned with Greco-Roman, certainly a mystic, you know, ideals.
6943000	6944000	Yeah.
6944000	6947000	And so, yeah, and we see that.
6947000	6951000	I mean, it is, when you know the context, it's so clear as well.
6951000	6956000	I mean, you know, a lot of people ask themselves, why did they have to go all the way around?
6956000	6959000	It doesn't make any sense to go all the way around.
6959000	6966000	And yeah, well, you want to, you want to establish this Eastern, you know, Eastern Providence.
6966000	6968000	Providence, right.
6968000	6972000	And that's, and that's, it's actually fascinating.
6972000	6977000	When you look at the truth, sometimes it's more fascinating than the tradition.
6977000	6978000	Yeah.
6978000	6979000	Always.
6979000	6980000	Yeah.
6980000	6981000	That's what gets me up in the morning.
6981000	6990000	For me, researching this, it's always about lifting the hood and looking, what is the reality on the ground?
6990000	6995000	Now, again, as I started saying, I'm not anti-bible or anything like that, but the beauty of the Bible,
6995000	7000000	what makes it so beautiful in many parts of it, and all of terrible parts as well.
7000000	7009000	But in many parts of it, what makes, what gives it, its power is simply a question of geography.
7009000	7022000	Because, you know, the provinces of Judea and Samaria between the Bible was kind of written between the two or composed between these two.
7022000	7032000	That's where every military power, every empire had to go past through that region and leave its imprints in that region.
7032000	7043000	And so the Bible is basically a story of humanity, of how humans left their imprint in this one bridge between Africa, Asia and Europe.
7043000	7065000	And that's what gives this text, its power, really, that every, all of ancient humanities, at least in these continents in Africa, Asia and in Europe, left an imprint that is discernible in this corpus.
7065000	7071000	Yeah, and it's almost like you're getting this tapestry of different layers of different time periods.
7071000	7074000	You've got the archaic layer that's in there somewhere.
7074000	7080000	And then you have, as you mentioned, the Persian, Zoroastrian influences start to trickle into the text.
7080000	7091000	And then you get this later Hellenistic layer of influences and, you know, the pre-Socratics with their monism and dyads and all that stuff, it starts to get pushed into the text.
7091000	7099000	And so you have a tapestry of different centuries of time periods, different influences, and it's being sewn together.
7099000	7107000	This could only happen to this extent in that region just for reasons of pure geographic reasons.
7107000	7118000	But all of these different sort, you know, you have the Persian Empire that brought ideas and influences from India as well.
7118000	7122000	And of course, from Iran, I mean, the Iranic peoples.
7122000	7124000	And you have the Greeks and you have the Egyptians.
7124000	7131000	So you have everything converging in that local area, this little, tiny little area that absorbed from all of them.
7131000	7135000	And that is what eventually produced this corpus.
7135000	7140000	I mean, what's beautiful about it is the humanity of it.
7141000	7149000	And just all of these different cultures coming together, leaving an imprint and moving on.
7149000	7151000	And this was absorbed.
7151000	7154000	Now, again, it was absorbed somehow.
7154000	7164000	But it was completely unknown to most Yahoists, or practically almost all Yahoists, up until the Hellenistic period.
7164000	7169000	I mean, imprints were left, but they were not widely known.
7170000	7184000	And in that change, this is another book that I'm also working on, that changed with the Museum in Alexandria.
7184000	7195000	I mean, what people need to understand, I mean, Ptolemy I and Alexander III, they grew up together.
7195000	7197000	I mean, they were childhood friends.
7197000	7199000	They both were students of Aristotle.
7199000	7200000	Exactly.
7200000	7208000	And when they founded Alexandria, the idea was to implement Aristotle's ideals.
7208000	7214000	And so the city was well planned with, you know, with the grid of streets.
7214000	7217000	I mean, a very modern city.
7217000	7226000	The temple was had, you know, the doors were automatic in opened up automatically because of hydraulic.
7226000	7236000	You know, when you when you walked on the on the on the kind of the platform leading to the temple, the hydraulic pressure would cause the doors to open up.
7236000	7241000	And so people, this was the high, this was like Silicon Valley of the engine world.
7241000	7246000	I mean, this is what where you want, if you want to go to the to the cutting edge technology of the time, you want to go to the.
7247000	7250000	To where things are are done.
7250000	7252000	You go to Alexandria.
7252000	7260000	Now, Ptolemy the first created his palace in Alexandria and around surrounded it with the temple in the museum.
7260000	7269000	The museum was just a place of the muses and within the museum you had the museum you had the famous library of Alexandria.
7269000	7274000	And it was the first library in real library in the world.
7274000	7282000	People often say, well, there are libraries before the library of Alexandria, like assure by Nepal and other, but these were archives.
7282000	7284000	These were not libraries.
7284000	7288000	This is where you would put different texts, administrative texts, but also literary texts.
7288000	7295000	You would put them in an archive to conserve them or to teach scribes how to, you know, how to learn their profession.
7295000	7296000	But these were archives.
7296000	7305000	These were not libraries are different between an archive and the library is that an archive is for to conserve or to use as material to teach scribes and things like that.
7305000	7324000	But it is not a place to study texts critically, which is really kind of what Aristotle wanted his followers wanted to do, and to find where different manuscripts of the text don't disagree with themselves or where the same manuscript has all kinds of, you know, disagreements.
7324000	7327000	Disagreements within its own text.
7327000	7334000	And so starting to critically study study text, that is what happened in Alexandria.
7334000	7344000	And we see that also the same methodology also applied in the Bible, addition, redaction, et cetera, et cetera, following the same idea.
7344000	7360000	Now, historically, it is so clear and so conspicuous that up until, you know, the library was established late really the tail end of the fourth century beginning of the third century BCE in Alexandria.
7360000	7373000	Up until that moment, we see no, as I said several times already today, zero evidence of any type of knowledge of the Bible anywhere in any of the Jewish diaspora,
7373000	7376000	whether in Egypt, Babylonia, Judea, Samaria, et cetera.
7376000	7378000	No one knows anything.
7378000	7380000	There are no names that are related to the Bible.
7380000	7381000	There are no nothing.
7381000	7382000	No one.
7382000	7384000	It's simply not inexistent.
7384000	7387000	This changes at the beginning of the third century.
7387000	7392000	So clearly we start seeing those names appearing in the, in the list of names and you know, must take on.
7392000	7406000	We start seeing, you know, people like, you know, whatever text that we have there, we start seeing people at that time around the time of the museum.
7406000	7411000	People start knowing something about the Bible, referring to the Bible.
7411000	7416000	It, I mean, it is so clear that there was a shift around that time.
7416000	7420000	And as a historian, I look for triggers.
7420000	7426000	What may, what causes something causes change in history and you need to find the trigger.
7426000	7434000	And the trigger, I mean, the, the, the, this library in Alexandria is such a clear trigger, such a major trigger.
7434000	7445000	And you see it in the archeological records so clearly there's nothing before and every, and it starts after that I think it's, I mean, it's really hard to argue with that.
7445000	7451000	This is what I've been saying for as long as I started to discover some of this information.
7451000	7464000	And then obviously we get the Septuagint translation coming a little bit later, but it doesn't seem like the construction or the creation of Genesis, for example, let's just take Genesis by itself.
7464000	7471000	Doesn't seem to be, have been constructed that much earlier, maybe less than a century before at some point.
7471000	7476000	Even decades.
7476000	7478000	We talked about Virgil.
7478000	7481000	It took him 10 years to write the Annihats.
7481000	7491000	Okay, it took him 10 years, one person, and the Annihats in terms of their, of their length, I mean, it's about the same size as the Pentateuch.
7491000	7496000	So it's one person, 10 years to write the equivalent of the Pentateuch.
7496000	7499000	Now, Virgil also used earlier sources.
7499000	7502000	He did not come up with the idea of Annihats coming from the East.
7502000	7506000	It was already very popular in Rome before him.
7506000	7511000	There were earlier sources, and one person did that in 10 years.
7511000	7520000	There's the Sean Amé, which is much later, of course, but Ferdowsi who wrote the Sean Amé, which is like the great Iranian epic.
7520000	7521000	Beautiful.
7521000	7525000	I highly recommend the viewers to check that out.
7525000	7538000	The Sean Amé is 150, I mean, it's like 1.5 times greater than the, the entire Bible, including the New Testament.
7538000	7543000	I mean, the Old Testament and New Testament times, you know, 1.5.
7543000	7546000	One man wrote that in 30 years.
7546000	7551000	So 30 years of one man is the equivalent of 1.5, the entire Biblical call was.
7551000	7555000	And, and also he used earlier material as well.
7555000	7556000	Okay.
7556000	7570000	And, and, but he, but this was so people can write this if there is a, if there is, if the right trigger exists and there is the right motivation, people can write this corpus very, very quickly.
7570000	7574000	It's not, it's not, it happened in.
7574000	7584000	And when we look at, and I look at Genesis, for example, it seems to be similar in its, in its construction to other theogonies,
7584000	7596000	slash Genesis stories, creation myths of the time period where you have a God who's a Demiurgic creator and he takes it makes heaven and earth, our nose and Gaia, which is what you see in like theogonies.
7596000	7600000	And it's sort of Ferricides has a different version of this.
7600000	7602000	Appellodorus has a different version.
7602000	7604000	They're all, they're all contemporary.
7604000	7607000	Plato, Plato with the Timaeus.
7607000	7609000	That's what I was just going to say.
7609000	7614000	What, what we get in Genesis seems to be more platonic, maybe not exact.
7614000	7616000	I think it's influenced by platonic.
7616000	7617000	What would you say?
7617000	7618000	Well, it's hard to know.
7618000	7619000	I mean, it's not exact.
7619000	7620000	Of course, it's not one to one.
7620000	7622000	It's not exactly the same.
7622000	7623000	There are some certain elements.
7623000	7629000	I think it's influenced, it's heavily influenced as is Plato himself by Persian, by Persian.
7629000	7630000	He admits this.
7630000	7633000	He says that he says that Pythagoras was taught by Zoroaster.
7633000	7634000	That's right.
7634000	7652000	So they're all, they're all borrowing from each other, but it seems to be in this particular period where you start to see all these ideas of, of a single perfected, not perfect, but like, you know, some sort of eternal Demiurgic power who's above all the daemons.
7652000	7660000	Well, I mean, you have that in, in, in, in Egyptian, in the Egyptian worldview for, you know, millennia before that.
7660000	7663000	So, I mean, it's not exactly necessarily new.
7663000	7671000	The question is not it's so again, as a historian, you look for triggers, you don't see a historical trigger for that necessarily.
7671000	7681000	Then if, if you don't see a trigger, what you need to do is start looking at at individual, you know, data points within the text to see, are they closer to the Egyptian model or to the.
7681000	7683000	Persian model or to whatever.
7683000	7693000	So you need to start analyzing because there is no trigger you started to start analyzing the data as per se and seeing what, what, what, what it relates to more.
7693000	7705000	It's really interesting because a lot of the ancient ideas like that have a very, very lengthy time, you know, very shelf life.
7705000	7706000	Okay.
7706000	7717000	They were therefore, you know, some ideas are, you know, you find them in Sumerian texts, and they, and they appear also in, in Hellenistic Babylonia.
7717000	7718000	Okay.
7718000	7729000	And so you, a lot of these texts are very often scholars in my field, unfortunately, they say, well, this looks like something from, you know, that we find in the new Assyrian text.
7729000	7731000	And therefore, I will date it to the new Assyrian.
7731000	7733000	That is extremely simplistic.
7733000	7748000	When I do that with Amos, I mentioned that earlier, when I do that with Amos, I show how just the level of detail where he uses idiomatic expressions that would be lost on people in later centuries.
7748000	7756000	But so that's why I date, I can date the text really quickly, but I only really precisely, but I only date.
7757000	7761000	I'm trying to be really, really cautious and really scientific about this.
7761000	7774000	When I can see clear parallels that are indisputable between these corp, the different corpora that where you can actually make that connection.
7774000	7782000	But otherwise, you know, it's really hard to date these texts in any, in any, you know, in any really precise form.
7782000	7785000	And we should, we should be extremely cautious with that.
7785000	7796000	It's, it's overly simplistic to say, for example, they mentioned Cyrus, so clearly it was written during the lifetime of Cyrus, for example, or that is simply not.
7796000	7804000	I had, I had an even worse argument thrown at me about Genesis predating, or this, this is what I'm not going to name names.
7804000	7806000	I don't want to, it's been a friend of mine.
7806000	7807000	He's a good scholar too.
7808000	7812000	But in this particular thing, he really threw me, I was like, what?
7812000	7813000	Well, I'll tell you what he said.
7813000	7820000	I go, can you find anyone that's citing Genesis in the prophets, for example, or any, because I'm trying to find out when was Genesis written?
7820000	7821000	I think it's Hellenistic.
7821000	7827000	But I asked him, I said, what can you find anyone citing Genesis or quoting from Genesis?
7827000	7828000	And I just asked him this question.
7828000	7830000	And he said, yes, Isaiah does.
7830000	7837000	And then he gives me a passage from Isaiah that has one word in common with one word from a sentence in Genesis.
7837000	7839000	They're not even talking about the same thing.
7839000	7840000	One of them was about creation.
7840000	7841000	The other one was about destruction.
7841000	7842000	They're opposites.
7842000	7849000	And I go, wait, so you're saying that this one word in common with this sentence makes him, I go, that's not a citation.
7849000	7854000	You know what, let's, let's, even if you said to me, this is not up for debate and left.
7854000	7859000	Okay, so that's, that, that person is clearly not thinking scientifically.
7859000	7872000	But, but you know what, even for the sake of discussion, let's say we find in Isaiah or wherever in Jeremiah, doesn't matter where an actual reference to the garden of Eden, whatever, with actual verbatim quotes.
7872000	7874000	What does that mean?
7874000	7875000	Nothing.
7875000	7877000	Strictly nothing.
7877000	7880000	Because it could be edited.
7880000	7885000	Well, I was going to say, then you have to wonder, is this one coming after the other one now?
7885000	7889000	Well, but, but even that is mean is meaningless.
7889000	7900000	I mean, the question, the point is that we know that the biblical text underwent so many, you know, hands editing and redacting it.
7900000	7904000	We know from Qumran that sometimes they change just one word.
7904000	7925000	What am I, if your unit is just the single word, and you can't even date, you don't know when that word was written and added to the text, the text, you know, the text of Jeremiah, the text of Joshua was still was still in flux in the first
7925000	7932000	century, see, Josephus had a different version of Joshua than what we are familiar with.
7933000	7941000	Yeah. And so we have, I mean, first, that's first century CE, you know, and the text of Joshua is still in flux.
7941000	7942000	Okay.
7942000	7959000	So, I mean, knowing how the Bible was constantly, I mean, it was a text, a living text that will be people still, you know, still edited and adapted to their own ideologies.
7960000	7972000	Throughout the first centuries, BC and into the first century CE, you know, it was a still a highly debated and very, very much still a battleground at that time.
7972000	7982000	So knowing this, it is very easy to add references like we mentioned earlier to Hosea in to the Exodus in Hosea.
7982000	7983000	Right.
7983000	7996000	And if I want to make, and by the way, the, the people in Alexandria, the Greeks or the Macedonians in Alexandria, did the same thing with to the Greek to Homer and Hesiod and others.
7996000	8012000	Right. They, they edited the text and when they, when they saw contrasts and contradictions between the texts, they made sure that they to correct those texts and may and add and change a word here, change a paragraph there.
8012000	8014000	They did that with the Greek texts.
8014000	8021000	And of course, also the Jewish redactors, editors of the Bible did the same there as well.
8021000	8026000	It was obvious it was natural to do.
8026000	8037000	You know, the people in Qumran, for example, had no problem writing texts with the same believing that they have the same authority as the as the authors of the biblical texts.
8037000	8045000	You know, it's not, or not in Qumran, but at least the writings that were preserved in Qumran.
8045000	8054000	And so, yeah, and so the biblical texts, it was alive. It was something that is a living document that people are still writing.
8054000	8058000	It was not yet fossilized. It was not yet canonized.
8058000	8073000	And it was, it was a living documents with a document with different sects fighting for their narrative to be to be more, you know, more widely accepted than the others.
8073000	8076000	Yeah. And this scholar, I had to look up what was said.
8076000	8077000	It was Jeremiah.
8077000	8087000	So I asked him, I go, is there any instances of one of the prophets citing from Genesis or quoting and saying, as Moses says, he says, yes, Jeremiah 423.
8087000	8089000	And I look, okay, look it up.
8089000	8093000	Jeremiah 423 says, I looked at the earth and it was formless and empty.
8093000	8096000	And the head and at the heavens, their light was gone.
8096000	8100000	And I'm like, so where's the citation?
8100000	8102000	And then he was like, this is what he says.
8102000	8105000	He says, it's clearly dependent on Genesis.
8105000	8107000	And I was like, what do you mean clearly?
8107000	8110000	And he's like, are you being serious right now?
8110000	8111000	He got like mad at me.
8111000	8116000	And I was like, I'm just asking, how do you, how do you just assume this is borrowing from Genesis?
8116000	8119000	And it's because that word formless is in there.
8119000	8122000	And I'm like, and I just don't think strong connection at all.
8122000	8123000	I just think that's.
8123000	8127000	Well, I mean, again, even if the quote was verbatim verbatim.
8127000	8128000	By the way, which it isn't.
8128000	8129000	It is my notes.
8129000	8140000	So it's not, but I'm saying, even if to give your benefit of a doubt to your friend, even if this was verbatim, it's very easy for a redactor in the Hellenistic period to add this.
8141000	8144000	This quote into the text of Jeremiah.
8146000	8147000	You know what I'm saying?
8147000	8152000	It's not, it's, it means nothing because you add, we see that these texts were constantly.
8152000	8161000	I mean, the form, you know, the Jeremiah between the, the, the Septuagint version of Jeremiah and the Masoretic text of Jeremiah are very, very different.
8162000	8163000	Very different.
8163000	8171000	Also, the length is very deep, not just the, I mean, the, the, the location of the chapters is very different and the length of the text is different.
8171000	8179000	But also if you compare that to the Qumran version that we found in command of Jeremiah, it is even different than these two.
8179000	8180000	Okay.
8180000	8188000	Jeremiah was still being the text of Jeremiah was still being worked on in the second century, first century BCE.
8188000	8189000	Okay.
8189000	8199000	And they changed, they moved around versus they moved around a, a a, a, a, a corricapies, they moved around chapters, they moved the, the, you know, the added stuff.
8199000	8201000	They, you know, they removed stuff.
8201000	8209000	They were, it was still undergoing in the second century BC in the first century BC, still undergoing edition, action, et cetera.
8209000	8210360	with action, et cetera.
8210360	8215360	So very easy, if I wanted to make people believe
8216320	8218560	that Genesis was a very ancient text
8218560	8223000	or a very fundamental text to the people,
8223000	8226400	very easy to add quotes into the text of Jeremiah
8226400	8229040	or into the text of Hosea or Joel or whatever.
8229040	8232720	And you can do it in Amos.
8232720	8235800	You can add something that seems to be
8235840	8240160	and to be a citation from Genesis or Exodus.
8240160	8241400	And then people would say, well, look,
8241400	8243400	Amos knew about this.
8243400	8245240	Now, first of all, if you're approaching this
8245240	8246840	from a scientific perspective,
8246840	8249800	saying that there was a person like Amos,
8249800	8252520	it's not scientific, okay?
8252520	8253360	There might have been.
8253360	8256560	I don't really know, but I can't assert that there was.
8257680	8262680	I, in my article on Amos and I normally don't,
8263080	8266720	most of my articles are not on real kind of biblical issues
8266720	8271240	like that, but in this particular article on Amos,
8273720	8276520	I refer to the Amosian school.
8276520	8279760	I'm not talking about a specific person.
8279760	8283360	And I, again, try to be, when I say scientific,
8283360	8285520	I mean, I do not take,
8286040	8291040	I need to have evidence before making a claim.
8293680	8296160	I can't just say, okay, well, the Bible says so,
8296160	8297900	therefore it's historical.
8299200	8300180	And you know what?
8300180	8303400	The Bible never claims to be in the book of history.
8303400	8308400	I mean, the concept was not even developed yet.
8308920	8311640	So that was not one of its concerns.
8311640	8314720	It was involved in an ideological battle
8314760	8318400	between sects on the, I mean, again,
8318400	8320920	just like the Annihads in Rome are not,
8320920	8323960	they don't claim to be actualist history.
8323960	8326160	Everyone knew that this is a form of mythology,
8326160	8328080	but they accepted mythology.
8328080	8330280	They had no problem with mythology.
8330280	8332920	Mythology was a form of history.
8332920	8334900	They, I mean, they, you know,
8334900	8337040	and so it's not like today
8337040	8341800	when we equate mythology with lie, it's not lie, okay?
8341800	8343100	It is a tradition.
8344100	8345900	You know, your mythology is your tradition.
8345900	8348700	It is the stories that your ancestors told.
8348700	8349620	It's not a lie.
8349620	8351300	It is a tradition.
8351300	8354500	It is something that's part of your ethnic heritage, right?
8354500	8358060	Your ethnic DNA or your kind of cultural DNA.
8359100	8364100	And mythology was viewed with high regard.
8364140	8366980	Today we see mythology as something that is a lie
8366980	8370020	or almost, you know, people telling you something
8370020	8372660	in order to, almost a marketing ploy.
8372660	8377140	But that simply was not the case in the ancient world.
8377140	8381060	Yeah, and it normally represents some truths within it.
8381060	8383300	There is a grain of truth in every mythology, right?
8383300	8384620	Absolutely.
8384620	8386240	Yeah, not to, you know,
8386240	8387300	I just thought that was interesting
8387300	8391060	how when I asked that question, it was like there was,
8391060	8393460	it was like, I was being rude to them
8393460	8396540	for even questioning that Genesis could be,
8396540	8398980	it was very strange the way it went down, but.
8398980	8402340	People are very emotional about this, of course.
8402340	8405380	And I see it all the time, of course,
8405380	8406740	and I get accused of, you know,
8406740	8408380	all kinds of accusations because of this.
8408380	8412580	But, you know, I am committed and I work on this
8412580	8414500	very closely with my students
8414500	8416780	to being committed to the science,
8416780	8421320	the scientific method of historical research.
8421320	8424700	And I do not, again, for example,
8424700	8428580	showing that there was a unified linguistic identity
8428580	8431540	already in the sixth century, late seventh,
8431540	8434440	as I said earlier today in our discussion.
8435740	8438140	Some people see that as being conservative, right?
8438140	8441100	To see, well, there was already a unified,
8441100	8442820	kind of quote, unquote, Jewish identity
8442820	8444960	already that early on.
8445980	8447940	Some people see that as a conservative
8447940	8450020	because it's in scholarship,
8450020	8455020	it's, you usually talk, you see Jews as Judean
8456020	8458460	rather than Celtic.
8458740	8462580	There was, I mean, the common opinion in scholarship
8462580	8466420	is that there was no Celtic unity among Yahwists
8466420	8470740	until when they started to be identified as Jews,
8470740	8472700	which is only in the Asmonean period.
8474460	8479460	And so usually, what's normal in scholarship is to say,
8480700	8483940	to use the word Jews only from the second century BC.
8483940	8486980	And here I say, well, I still don't use the word Jews,
8487420	8490540	but I'm saying there was a common Yahwistic identity
8490540	8494340	that goes way beyond the borders of Judea
8494340	8499100	already in the seventh and into the sixth century BC
8499100	8503540	and was very clear from the quote, unquote, exile on.
8505180	8508340	And that's another thing you start seeing synagogues
8508340	8510900	in the Hellenistic era, not before that, though.
8510900	8512700	That's right, that's right.
8512700	8515460	And so in Jonathan, my friend Jonathan Adler,
8515460	8517940	who's an excellent scholar,
8517940	8519740	none of you have had him already on your show
8519740	8522260	or if not, you should, but his book,
8522260	8527260	The Origins of Judaism is just a great work
8529180	8531660	that describes this very, very clearly
8531660	8534860	from the archeological, starting from the archeologist
8534860	8539860	to from the archeological data on how that developed.
8540860	8545860	But yeah, history, actual reality is much more interesting
8546820	8550420	than the stories that they told you about the Bible.
8550420	8551420	And again, not-
8551420	8553980	It makes me like the Bible more, it does.
8553980	8555660	Exactly, I mean, exactly.
8555660	8559460	Look, I mean, there are a lot of scriptures out there
8559460	8563220	like the Avesta, the Rig Veda, and the Vedas in general,
8564100	8566900	that are rich, beautiful works.
8567260	8569940	They also have, they also interact
8569940	8572180	with historical events.
8572180	8575300	They have beautiful hymns, beautiful, beautiful,
8575300	8577620	beautiful work, not less than the Bible.
8577620	8582380	The difference with the Bible is simply its geography,
8582380	8584580	where all of these came together
8584580	8587580	and left their imprint in some way, shape, or form
8587580	8590260	in this region, just because of where it's located.
8590260	8592340	You had to cross, if you want to go from Egypt
8592340	8596300	to the, to Mesopotamia, you had to cross this area
8596300	8598860	or if you wanted to go from Mesopotamia to Egypt
8598860	8603100	or from Europe to Egypt, as Alexander did, for example,
8603100	8606460	you had to go through this region and leave an imprint.
8606460	8609540	And that's what gives the Bible its unique flavor.
8609540	8612100	But there are a lot of beautiful, you know,
8612100	8614980	scriptural works other than the Bible that exists there.
8614980	8619860	I don't think they are less beautiful and less authoritative.
8621060	8624100	And, but certainly the Bible is up there,
8624860	8629860	and its uniqueness is just how eclectic it is, right?
8631260	8634580	Conserving elements from all of these empires,
8634580	8636500	from the Assyrian Empire, the Babylonian Empire,
8636500	8640220	the Persian Empire, the Hellenistic Empire's plural
8640220	8643620	into the Roman, and all of this,
8643620	8647580	all of these left a mark that is conserved,
8647580	8650220	and you can still hear these echoes in the Bible today.
8650220	8654060	And that's what I think makes it really unique and powerful.
8654100	8656420	Simply its humanity.
8656420	8657420	Well said.
8657420	8659900	I mean, we cover a lot of ground in this discussion,
8659900	8664380	and I just want to, I don't know if that was perfectly well said,
8664380	8668020	we can end on that, and I just want to give you the time to,
8668020	8669820	you know, talk about anything that's coming up
8669820	8671180	that you want to promote.
8671180	8672700	Obviously, you got the book coming out,
8672700	8674300	anything else besides that?
8675300	8676500	Well, I have this book coming out.
8676500	8679660	I have a number of books as well,
8679660	8682860	kind of on that I'm finishing now, I mean, finishing it.
8682860	8684660	I'm writing, I was commissioned to write a book
8684660	8687300	about Elephantine, the history of the Elephantine,
8687300	8690140	yeah, with the community there, so they asked me to write that,
8690140	8693740	and that's, I'm already working on that, of course.
8693740	8695980	That's good, that's a big project, of course,
8695980	8701460	to actually write the history of this absolutely amazing community.
8701460	8704420	The good thing is, of course, I have several articles on this
8704420	8711180	that I can use in this work on this book,
8711180	8715740	and I have, yeah, I have these other books that I mentioned
8715740	8719340	throughout our talk today also about the Alexandria,
8719340	8722660	the museum on Alexandria, and its impact on biblical,
8722660	8726780	on the biblical evolution of the biblical text,
8726780	8728660	and on the composition of the biblical text,
8728660	8734260	putting them together, and yeah, but really, I think what's,
8734260	8738900	I'm extremely excited about this book that is coming out,
8738940	8741540	Yahwism under the Achaemenid Empire,
8741540	8743260	because, of course, it's not just me,
8743260	8748500	it's colleagues that are fantastic, that have contributed to this,
8748500	8753580	that were in our, in the conference in 2022,
8753580	8757700	really the great scholars, just so if you read that book,
8757700	8762020	you have, you get, and by the way, not all of them agree with me,
8762020	8767540	even within the book, and so you can get a,
8768540	8772860	a glimpse into the discussions, some of them, you know,
8772860	8775860	disagree with one another, but that's exactly what you wanted to have.
8775860	8780420	We wanted to have all of the different points of view,
8780420	8783860	or, in case, you know, major points of view,
8783860	8786500	discussing different things together, and really get,
8786500	8790700	so when you read the different chapters or different contributions,
8790700	8795900	in that book, you get a very, very good picture of Yahwism
8795900	8799260	at that, under the Achaemenid Empire,
8799260	8801260	and of course, you can agree or disagree with me,
8801260	8806500	or with my colleagues, or with other, other people there, on there,
8806500	8810740	but at least all of us try to make our,
8810740	8816740	the most scientific arguments we can to, to support our, our arguments,
8816740	8817340	support our positions.
8817340	8818980	Yeah, I can't wait to see, do you think,
8818980	8822260	and you think this book is going to bring some,
8822260	8825220	some game changers out, like some stuff that no one's ever,
8825220	8827580	like this is going to shake things up a little bit, right?
8827580	8828420	Yeah, absolutely.
8828420	8830980	There are a number of articles there that are going to be,
8830980	8835340	to shape, really shake things up, and, and, and open up.
8835340	8838700	I think this book is going to be a reference book for decades,
8838700	8842700	you know, into the future, that all scholars in our field will,
8842700	8846420	will have to have on their, on their, under desk.
8846420	8847260	Yes.
8847260	8848580	I agree.
8848580	8852580	This is going to be a reference book for, for, for decades to come.
8852580	8853860	Is there a way to pre-order it?
8853860	8855820	Can people pre-order it now or no?
8855820	8856740	I think, I think so.
8856740	8862220	There's already, there's already a, a, a, it's already on the decorator website.
8862220	8862820	Oh, okay.
8862820	8865020	So I'll put the link in the description right now.
8865020	8867740	So people watching this now, pre-order that thing.
8867740	8869660	This is going to be the book that it's going to change
8869660	8872420	with biblical scholarship as we know it.
8872420	8875500	Yeah, and I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm promoting it as much as I can.
8875500	8877420	I think it's, I just promote and promote good stuff.
8877420	8881900	So definitely I'll put the link in the description, check that out.
8881900	8885380	And you have just attained true gnosis.
