30000	60000	and welcome back to a new episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of this week's episode of
60000	66880	this week's episode of this episode of our combination of 2 season 2 and you're
66880	73040	about to attain trunosis. And today we're going to talk about the question I've been asking
73040	81320	Bible scholars for years and I cannot get to the bottom of this question. And there, if
81320	87800	it's about Mark 14 the grandest chapter of all the chapter is Mark. Mark is the first
87800	92120	most important gospel, in my opinion, is the mystery, the mystery being revealed.
92120	99240	But when we get to chapter 14, all of a sudden, all these mysterious things are happening.
99240	105960	Jesus' feet are being anointed. The Peter is being told that the cock will crow three times,
105960	113240	and then he will deny Jesus. And all these weird stuff that doesn't make sense in English.
114200	120440	And so I decided, if the Bible scholars aren't telling me what's going on at the end of Mark 14
120440	127960	with this little boy in the Garden of Gethsemane running away naked as Jesus is being arrested
127960	133880	by Judas and people bearing the torches, if the Bible scholars can't tell me what's going on here,
133880	138600	I'm going to turn it into the classicists. Because the classicists, they know the Greek.
139560	143160	So you can't learn a lot about classical Greek through the Koinei,
143160	145960	but you can learn a lot about the Koinei through the classical Greek because the
145960	150200	Koinei comes out of classical Greek. Does that make sense? So with that being said,
150200	153800	before we get into anything, I just want to let you guys know Lady Babylon.
154520	161640	Go and subscribe. Nobody on the internet is going as deep as Dr. Amon, who is my guest today.
162360	163880	Dr. Amon, how are you doing today?
166040	170120	Great, great, Neil. Thanks for having me. It's so nice to be here.
171320	175320	Absolutely. I'm looking forward to this. Links in the description for the channel.
175320	178840	Go and subscribe. And it's one of some of the best stuff out there.
178840	185560	Some of the, like I said, there's different types of scholars and you and people like Dr. Ruck
186280	191480	who are not afraid to step on people's toes and get a little dirty once in a while.
191480	197880	This is where it's at Lady Babylon. And yeah, check it out. But let's get into this topic of
198520	205880	Mark 14. What is this? I'm actually going to let you take it away for a little bit.
205880	210840	I'll jump in with a few questions here and there. But this is something that needs to be explained
211880	215320	a little more than just a couple of sentences. We need to go through, let's go through the Greek
215320	220200	systematically and describe what's going on here. And then maybe we can come to a conclusion.
222200	228120	Yeah, that's my, that's my bag to nail. I love it when you call up the sources and you're just
228120	233880	like, let's just look at what they said and see what we can gather from what they're saying.
233880	239800	We just listen in for a moment. So let's jump right into those sources. I want to, Neil knows,
239800	246520	I want to bring you the apocalypse, right? I want to show you. I want that thing revealed.
247320	253880	I want that sacred made profane so that you can get in there and Jesus's world
253880	260040	right there with him and see him for what he is. So let's go to the, let's go to the very first
260680	264840	passage. This is Mark, right? We're taking the Gospels here. Yeah.
265800	283480	And there was this kid, some kid was with him. And this verb soon accoluthae, right?
284440	291960	From soon accoluthae. Oh, this verb is what you talk about when you talk about slaves being assigned
292040	300680	to someone. So there's some slave kid assigned to him. Yeah. And he's petty, this is from Perry
300680	309560	Balo. Nice, nice, you know, standard, standard Greek just means to throw and Perry means around.
310200	316200	Yeah. He's thrown around himself. He's using something. What is he using? Seendona.
317000	323160	He's using a Seendona. And we have the word here for Seendona. This is everybody knows this
323160	329080	passage. This kid with this thing. Can we see some, Neil, can we see some of the,
329720	335080	yeah, look what kind of translations we have. Yeah. I just pulled out a whole plethora of
335080	340680	English so that nobody can say, but what about this one? Here we have all laid out for us.
340760	346520	Yeah. The NIV down to the King James. It says, oh, I'm sorry, this is the wrong verse. Okay, sorry.
347320	354680	Here, a young man wearing nothing but a linen garment was following Jesus. But if I'm not mistaken,
354680	363720	young man, we're talking, the word Neo, Neoniscos is young boy. Isn't that the right
363720	368920	correction, correct translation for that? It comes from the root, it comes from the root,
368920	377320	Neil, Neos, and that is the idea of the budding. The idea is not a specific age group. Could this
377320	385160	kid be an early teenager? Hmm. It's the bud. He's in the, in the, in the newness of his life.
385720	391560	And that's important because remember, it's their world, not our world. We're imposing our view on
391560	399080	it, right? They're looking at this budding kid wearing nothing, right? Put a linen garment.
399720	404840	Ooh, that's a little bit of a stretch, right? A garment. Doesn't say garment there, right?
404840	411800	Linen shirt. Look at the next one. A linen shirt. Oh, yeah. Nothing but a linen cloth. Yeah, right?
411800	417240	See all the different kind of clothing that you end up getting in this, right? Because we want to
417240	423400	dress Jesus, but hey, let's pull up Alice, Neil, like, you know, we love to do. And let's see,
423400	429640	let's see what that seam done is. Look at this. So seam done is the linen cloth of the translation
429640	434360	that we're looking at. But this is, this is from Persia's top. So we'd like to call Alice,
435000	439640	because we're going into Alice Wonderland. We're going into the sources. This is all the times
439640	449960	his words use in the context. Fine cloth, usually linen, okay? Use for mummies. Surgeon bandages.
450760	454280	Wait a minute. Herodotus uses this word. I don't know if you guys know how to read
454280	462840	the Perseus Toss, but there you see that HDT 286. Herodotus in book two, verse 86,
462840	471960	use this word for a surgeon bandage. And what's cool, Neil, is Helen talks about these drugs.
471960	475960	I was a grad student trying to figure this out. And one day I was reading a text that said they
475960	484440	take this bandage and they impregnate it, they put the medicine in it, and then wrap the wound.
484440	490440	And okay, so anyway, let's go back to the passage. It's a band, right?
490680	495640	This is a medical use for it. So you're saying Galen uses this word for medical.
496920	504440	Yes, and not just Galen, right? But it's just referring to a strip of cloth. And this kid,
504440	510200	if you go back to our original text, that first one, this kid is wearing it. He's seen very
510200	519080	specifically, he says epigumnu on his place of shame, on his place of shame. He's wearing it,
519080	532440	right? Let's keep reading it. Let's keep reading it. And they took possession of him.
532440	539480	They arrested him. They strong armed him. There it's talking about Jesus. Typically,
539480	544920	they try to say this was the boy. But it doesn't make sense if it's the boy with the next Greek
544920	559320	that we have. The one who was naked fled after leaving his bandage. Yeah, right? Why? Because
559320	566120	they're not trying to strong arm the kid, right? They're trying to strong arm Jesus.
566760	574680	And that's when Jesus says so importantly, which is our next text. Check out this next text.
575240	582600	This one? Yeah. Yeah. And Jesus answers them, right? And he said to them, did you come out here
582600	594120	against me as if I were a laystace? Having your clubs and your weapons, you know, you're going
594120	600360	to take me this way? Yeah, your clubs and your swords, right? What are you doing? It's that famous
600360	608840	passage. But everybody remembers the laystace, Robert or the pirate, right? Jesus is saying,
608840	615160	I'm a pirate, right? Look there at the very bottom under Roman numer number two. Yeah. And you see the
615160	625080	cupris, the pirate of Cyprus. Oh, the reference, the reference and lycophron to 1143, where we
625160	636200	are talking about abducting young women to be sold to others for things like slavery,
638120	645080	sexual gratification, you can sell to a temple, they could have been sold off as priestesses,
645720	652200	right? But these are Jesus does, you're not coming out against me like I'm with all these weapons,
652280	659720	like I'm a some kind of child trafficker. So that's what he's saying with me says you're that I
659720	666360	didn't know that that that brings a lot of context to what he's talking about. Yeah. Yeah. So now,
666360	673480	you know, what about Jesus and child children and child sack of child trafficking? And is there
673480	679880	anything else if we're just detectives saying this is the this is the evidence we have and from the
679880	685160	Garden of Gethsemane, we have that one piece of evidence, we have that kid's
687720	695880	penile wrap, we have the penile wrap of the child. Yeah, that's the only like fragment of history
695880	703080	that was left at the scene, right? Otherwise, we know Jesus is saying he's not a pirate and he's
703080	712360	got it covered with some stuff that you write that they don't know, right? We're not like look,
712360	719400	we're not when it's not like we're pulling stuff out of our space, like the text tells us there's
719400	726040	a little boy in him in with him in the garden, as he's being arrested, who runs away naked.
727000	732600	Like we're this is not like we're not like going to like some apocryphal text somewhere and like
732600	739400	pulling out some random this is in the text in Mark. And so we're just asking questions like
739400	745480	what's going on here? Is it an initiation? Is there I've heard people say there was a resurrection,
745480	750920	you know, they say, oh, you know, he wasn't there. He didn't go there with John and and whoever
750920	756280	else was there. He just was there in the cemetery and Jesus resurrected him. I've heard that theory,
756280	761160	but the text doesn't say that. We're just adding stuff to whatever we want to the text.
761160	767880	The text doesn't say that. It only says there's a little boy who ran away naked. So what's going on
767880	774280	here? And the best thing to do now that's why I love to hang with you is because it's just those
774280	780520	texts that matter. I can come up with a theory for what's going on. It doesn't do me any good.
780600	785880	If I just treat those texts, and that's what I want to jump. I want to jump. Okay, I didn't want to do
785880	792680	this originally, but the last slide that the last. Yeah, there. Hey, guys, let's just I want to cut
792680	798440	to the chase on this one. Look at this. This is I don't want to talk about the background of this
798440	804600	thing whatsoever. People classify the pseudo climate. You can take that and deal with it. What
804600	812200	you want. I'm interested in the language here and what what the Greek is saying. So yeah. So
818120	825080	Jesus is mad, man, right right off the bat. And he came back with her, this woman to the garden
825640	833960	where was the male? Where was the cemetery? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And right away he heard from the
833960	843480	cemetery, right from this tomb on Phone Megali, a great voice and approaching. You know, Jesus
843480	850600	moved off the stone from the doorway of the tomb and entering in there right there was this
850600	857160	neoniskos. You can see this on the one, two, three, four, fifth line down. Neoniskos. See the
857160	864280	neoniskos. Yeah, yeah. Okay. And there was a neoniskos there. And what is he doing? He's stretching
864280	874920	out his hand and waking him up. Isn't that cool? He's waking. Wait, do you realize that we heard a
874920	885160	voice and we entered a tomb where a kid has to be roused? Where he has to be roused? Okay. Wow.
885160	890680	Thank you. Okay. Probably smells like opium in here, right? Okay.
894280	901240	Right. Honeoniskos. And so the kid does what? He looks up at him and he loves him.
904440	911640	He loves him. And remember, this is in a text that itself says, hey, Jesus was here a fan.
912600	919560	Wake up, people. Jesus was a here a fan. And what is it? It's in the text, yeah. One who teaches
919560	926440	the rites of sacrifice and worship, right? In Rome, it's just the pontiff. Herodotus uses it for
926440	934600	the initiation at Elusis. Yes, yes. So this is a very specific role. We have another source from
934600	941000	Plutarch says that this is what they call the pontifix maximus in Rome or the Jewish high priest.
941000	949000	So this is somebody who's religious, who's doing rites, hero funds, specifically those mystical
949000	955880	rites that we call the mystery, that we call the mystery. So if you go back to that text,
957800	963000	here we go. Here we go. What is he doing? He's with the kid there and he rouses him up. The kid
963000	970440	looking at him loves him. And Elxato Paracalene started to ask him that he might be with him.
971960	981400	What? And coming out from the tomb, Jesus went into the home, the oikia, the estate
982200	991320	of the kid for this kid was wealthy. He was loaded. And after six days, Jesus gave him
991400	1000280	instructions about how to look. And the kid came and wrapped around himself a scene done
1005240	1010840	he wrapped his scene down on his nakedness. Yeah. And he remained with him.
1011160	1024760	He remained with him for the night. Yeah, throughout the night. And now this is the kicker.
1024760	1037800	This is the kicker right at the end. And that guard there is telling you why did he stay with the
1037800	1049960	kid all night throughout the night? Because he was teaching him the musterion. Oh, mystery. Yeah.
1051960	1060040	And that's, that's what the chapter is leading up to. It's this, this scene in the garden. Yeah. Yeah.
1061240	1064920	I think it might be the longest chapter in Mark. I'm going to be wrong. It's one of the longest,
1064920	1071800	at least, but it leads up to this. And it's, it's very mysterious. There's something happening here.
1072600	1078440	And I think these, these Greek words are telling us, like, for example, you know, how we define
1078440	1086440	Hierophant, teaching the rites or the Sindon wearing the Sindon. So I'm, and I'm thinking in my head,
1086440	1092680	is there a relation to this? And this is another gospel, but like, I know this is like the
1092680	1096760	scholars say, don't compare gospel to gospel. They're two different writers, but like,
1096760	1103480	I can't help it. The, in John, you have the, the disciple whom Jesus loved. I wonder if this is
1103480	1109560	Mark's way of telling about who this character is, some sort of initiate, some sort of apprentice, maybe.
1112520	1118520	Yeah. And what's the connection with the boy having been assigned to Jesus? Like you buy a
1118600	1124040	slave to do something for a certain amount of time, you know, he's renting the person.
1124840	1132440	Right. And a lot of times the, these little kiddie slaves, they, they're involved in things that
1132440	1139400	aren't just for kids. And you think for yourself, you're sitting there and you think, oh, wait a
1139400	1145400	minute, I'm starting to make me a little bit nauseous. Yeah. Let's go back to the actual language.
1145960	1151480	Right. Because Jesus has a point where some people get upset at him. It's some of his own
1151480	1159240	followers and they say, Hey, stop treating the children like this says he was touching them.
1159240	1165800	And the word there is grabbing and also hop to pull hop to up. Here it is. Hop to.
1166520	1172200	I got it. Hop to. Yeah. Look at this people hop to. Can be, you know, it's not just touching
1172280	1181160	like, you know, touching. It's grabbing, right? It's, it's engaging something or attacking something.
1182360	1187880	Context and a wrestling. So yeah, that's a specific touch right there. And if, and if you look at number
1187880	1193400	five under Roman numer, number three, you see that it means to have straight up intercourse.
1193400	1200040	Oh my God. It can actually be used in that context. And it is used by Paul and Corinthians that way.
1201000	1209000	Wow. Okay. So my mind is officially blown right now. For those of you who think, you know,
1209000	1213160	for those of you who think, you know, coin a, Neil, can you take that off from
1214360	1219880	an appeal of vanity? Oh yeah. One second. It's got to go back down. Okay. Go ahead.
1219880	1226520	For those of you who don't think that, for those of you who think, you know, coin a.
1227240	1235880	Yeah. Kick up your stuff because yeah, you're going to need it. You're going to need it. He was,
1235880	1244120	so he's, he is in a situation where he's doing this to children and the, a group of his followers
1244120	1251000	stopped the parents from allowing it to take place and they say, Hey, stop doing this. And it says
1251000	1257320	they're upset and it uses Tima, which typically can be used in a kind of illegal sense. It's got
1257320	1264280	just a smidge of something judges say, right? Now let's tell you that that it's used by judges.
1265640	1272760	And so yeah. And so it's, it's a funny thing that they get these kids and Jesus steps up and
1273160	1279320	he says, he's angry and he says, no, you cannot enter into the kingdom
1281000	1291160	unless you are one of these children. Let's look at what he's talking about because it has this,
1291160	1296520	it has just a, just for us, it's just like, no, no, no, don't think that, don't think that,
1297240	1303960	right? But let's see what the Greeks were thinking. When he talks about his paideia,
1303960	1309560	what are these paideia people don't realize, right? Little children are following around Jesus,
1309560	1319720	why they need the prayer. He's going to, he's going to engage them. And he's going to enter into a
1319720	1329560	prayer and we see this in the performance of the mystery. And of course, that's why Jesus is so
1329560	1336440	out of this, you can't get into the kingdom unless you come by this avenue, right? Now,
1336440	1343800	what is this paidzo? What is it? What is this child thing in the, in the ancient Greek mind and the
1343800	1350280	ancient Mediterranean mind that was wrapped up in the, on the Hellenistic side with the Greek,
1351560	1355880	things are coming from their verbs. I want you to just take a look at this verb.
1356680	1368440	It is the base for child and it means to dance or play or play amorously. Wow. When you have the
1368440	1379880	word paideia in Greek, it is understood that there is a relationship between the teacher
1379880	1389720	and the teacher. And it has to do with touching and it has to do with the maturation of the bud,
1390920	1395960	right? You want to bring that bud to perfection. That's what they looked at
1396680	1404920	as purification, as education, excuse me, as education, as paideia. That's why they call
1405800	1415880	the horsemen who are hung the teachers of the princes. That's why they call them
1416760	1428120	pedarasts. That's a Greek word for that teacher, the pedarast. When Jesus is calling for paideia,
1428120	1438440	he is calling for victims of pedarasty. And we know that the, at least his attitude reflects this,
1438440	1444120	because when he gets called short on it, he says, you're going to end up scandalizing me,
1445080	1450360	right? Right? So for those of you who have the little Jesus blessed me and whatnot,
1450360	1457880	realize there's a tradition of directly touching children, of molesting children
1457880	1466360	associated with the rites and the mystery, okay? Neil, you know. Not a controversial statement.
1466360	1472760	Any classes this will say, yeah, this is part of the Greek world. This was normalized in the
1472760	1477480	Greek. I'm not saying I think we should bring it back or anything. I'm just saying that's the
1477480	1481960	reality of the fact. The Greeks were, you know what I'm saying? It's just the reality of it.
1483640	1491560	Actually, in fact, somewhere over here, I have a book titled Paralytes. And this scholar put
1491560	1505000	together like tons of texts of ancient Greek that are very, very graphic, sexual. And nine times out
1505000	1512760	of 10, it's an older male with a prepubescent boy. Nine times out of 10. That's what these texts are
1513720	1523400	portraying. We've got gods who have boys that pour their nectar. And we have gods
1523400	1534040	who are great mothers who bring their boys to maturation. These are essential to the mystery
1534040	1540520	rites. Both of the ones I just mentioned to you. Heracles performs mystery rites. The temples to
1540520	1547640	Heracles are temples where mystery rites are performed. Yes, fantastic. What about you thought
1547640	1554520	it was all athletics, right? So these are the same thing. They're doing the same things. When
1554520	1559160	you have the great mother and she's important, the great mother entering this whole equation,
1561560	1570200	you take that young boy Addis and you bring him into a point of burning off all of his
1570200	1579080	mortality, right? It's a process. And this idolatrous process involves a lot of drugs.
1579720	1584040	And I think, Neil, that's one of the areas that people, we can look at texts like this.
1584600	1588200	And we can say, oh my goodness, Jesus was a downright
1590120	1597480	magus. He was right in this, right in this magus tradition. Neil, why did, why did these magi
1597480	1607400	show up? I didn't say the three. These magi, why did they show up and say, brah, your child right
1607400	1614200	here, the one that was just born, we've been following his esterian. Yeah. And what we're
1614200	1621960	going to do is he's going to be the one who bears the, is that vessel that's straight up mystery,
1622040	1628760	that Christos, that's straight up mystery. There's a group of dudes imposing this upon him
1628760	1635960	from the beginning and giving him drugs. Jesus had drugs from the start. You cannot make these
1635960	1641400	drugs without the two bases that they gave him. They gave him frankincense and myrrh.
1641400	1646600	They gave him frankincense and myrrh and your preachers can preach all day. Anyone that knows
1646600	1656680	the orphic tradition, if you have a copy of the orphic hymns, those two oils are burnt in offering
1656680	1662600	to these pagan deities. You offer frankincense and then you do a hymn to Nyx, the goddess,
1663160	1670600	or a hymn to Hercules or something. Those are the two main oils that are burned in the orphic
1670600	1680040	fragments. That's what you're offering up before you take your incense and you offer it up to induce
1680040	1685720	because we know within the mystery, this is pretty cool. We know from later sources through the
1685720	1696200	Neopathagoreans that daemonace, demons function by smell. So the first Christian anti-drug laws
1696200	1704440	are specifically against drugs that are used to promote this process, to either drive away the
1704440	1711240	demons or to collect them. What are the pagans going to do? What can they do? Look at this.
1711240	1717160	I just flipped through a random page in the orphic hymns of Orpheus. Flip through a random page.
1717720	1723480	First thing it says, to Vulcan, offer fumigation of frankincense and manna.
1727400	1732360	I'm adding to what you just said. The point is, when you offered these frankincense and you lit it
1732360	1737960	up and the oil would burn, you're literally, the gods are smelling this and they would come
1737960	1744200	and they would listen to your hymn. That's how you contact with the gods in the Greek world.
1744200	1751400	No different in Christianity. Think of it this way. There's a place that you can go and you can buy
1751400	1762200	this smirna and this a woman puts on and in her vagina and it's a compound drug and what does it
1762200	1773080	smell like? It smells exactly like where it is. It is a place of bringing forward from death life.
1773640	1783720	It is a funk that they use in Ritu, in Rite, that involves the orgasmos, right?
1784360	1790760	So yeah, all of this stuff is, this is, I keep trying to convince people, Neil, that the pharmacy
1790760	1797800	and antiquity as we look at it, we're looking very, very two-dimensionally. When you blow it up
1797800	1802520	and look at it and say, look, they, they have this idea that comes from the Bronze Age,
1802520	1808200	that you can take a person and you can put them under the influence of certain drugs,
1808200	1818280	including venoms, you know, bee stings, spider, scorpion stings, all of these different venoms
1818280	1824280	that they're using. You can take a person and put them under that influence, right, and kick them
1824280	1832840	into a place called the Eremon, right, into the desert, where they will be forced to deal with
1833640	1842440	Lucifer, right, where they will be forced in that place. That kingdom is his kingdom. So yeah.
1843640	1846600	You mentioned, hold on a second, this is really deep, what you just said.
1847560	1855960	You mentioned the Magi tradition. In the, in the Zendivesta, which is a text that predates the
1855960	1865400	Gospels by a long centuries, very much, very old. There's a text where Zoroaster is in the desert
1866520	1874600	and he's roaming the desert and he's rushed by Anger Manu. And Anger Manu says, if you will
1874600	1881240	renounce the good God, Ahura Mazda, I'll give you the boons to rule all the nations.
1882280	1888200	And then Ahura Mazda, or then Zoroaster just starts chanting and then he makes Anger Manu leave.
1888760	1894760	Well, this is what you see in the Gospels, with Jesus in the desert being tempted by the devil,
1894760	1899320	who says, if you worship me, I'll give you all, I'll give you all the kingdoms of the world.
1899880	1902920	Exactly. This is coming from that tradition that you're talking about.
1902920	1908440	You see how it's part of the mystery and how it fits in and you see, oh, this is why they're doing
1908440	1914440	what they're doing. It's our Magi that, that, that recite these texts. There's a lot of drugs.
1914440	1923960	There's a lot of drugs and there are drug texts. I was reading one last month about this bites of
1924040	1931960	spiders and what to do and how to treat and what groups are using these types of drugs.
1933160	1940520	And the, the pharmacy is complex. It's really complex, but they are taking the human body
1940520	1949560	and they are turning it into a means of giving drugs to other people. So this whole thing about
1949560	1954520	people are shocked when they're like, what? I'm like, look, if you were in an ancient riot,
1954520	1960120	they're going to drug you beforehand. They're going to tie your hands behind your back,
1960120	1968120	restrain your ankles. They're going to sodomize you with a, a, an alabaster. It's a device.
1968120	1974520	By the way, that's also in Mark 14. Yes. Same chapter, same chapter that we're discussing
1974600	1980520	with the little boy. This chapter opens up with the alabaster, which is another mystery,
1980520	1985400	mystery religion term that you see thrown around there. And if you see how people translate,
1985400	1991160	it's always hilarious, right? I mean, they don't even make sense rationally. He busted the jar and
1991160	1995560	it was, that's how you do it. You break. No. And they're all mad. Remember the other things.
1995560	2003560	Remember, they're all mad because it was very expensive, right? What do you think that very
2003560	2010200	expensive stuff is for? That's the stuff that the initiates are using. That's the, that's the
2010200	2015480	hardcore. People aren't realized, but they have so many drugs in the ancient world. So many.
2015480	2021640	You can't even talk about arrows without talking the arrow poison that they're using in different
2021640	2026440	parts of the world. They're also getting high off it, but they're taking a person's body
2027080	2032840	and they're turning that person's body into the producer of the blood,
2033880	2041720	the hyma, which can also be ejaculate. Okay. So when Jesus' face is covered with that sticky stuff,
2041720	2048360	and it says it was his hedros, that it was his, originally it looks like sweat and it turns into
2048360	2054520	what looks like hyma. You know, that hyma is used especially in cold contexts
2055320	2064440	to the essence substance. You get the hyma, Zeus gets the hyma when he sucks the penis of
2065560	2072280	the invisible one. Doesn't this happen to Priapis too? Yeah.
2072760	2080760	Mm-hmm. And if you get that, yeah, no, he is that fanase. Yeah, fanase is that Priapis,
2080760	2085160	the invisible one is that Priapis, right? I mean, you said you were going to the wilderness.
2085160	2090040	You wanted to go, right? You took the drug, so they've got you and they've got you bound and
2090040	2097160	they've got you giving it to them. And by the way, the guy who's writing our letter,
2097240	2104680	whether it's Udo Clement or whatever, whoever is writing that letter says there are these dudes
2105640	2112520	who are doing things very good, who are doing things that are not, they're following the way of
2112520	2119480	Satan into the darkness, he says right here. Those carpocratians, too. Yeah, those carpocratians,
2119480	2125160	and what are they doing? They're doing unspeakable things with the flesh.
2125800	2133240	Deep things. And with, yeah. Puffed up with gnosis. It actually says puffed up gnosis.
2134600	2139960	This is so crazy, man. We're going deep right now. I'm loving this.
2141080	2147400	And Neil, you're so, you're even closer than you think with that puffed up because that's the
2147400	2155960	word for being, for bringing us its Pephocilmino on page on line five there, two, three, four, five.
2155960	2164280	Yeah. It's also used for snakes, making the noise of a hissing. Yeah. There might be a little bit
2164280	2171000	of terminology that's sneaking in here. These may be a specific group of people. For example,
2171560	2179560	they call the ioboloi ehidnon. Those are the poison throwers of the echidna, or the vipers.
2180120	2187000	The vipers are a group, a college of priestesses, and the ioboloi are the ones who pour the poison.
2187880	2195240	And by the way, these carpocratians are deriving their theology from biblical texts. They're not,
2195960	2203000	like, they get called heretics later on and in this text. But they're looking at Jesus as the
2203000	2212520	serpent in the desert that Moses held up. And John says, just as Moses held up a serpent in the desert,
2212520	2216440	so too shall the Son of Man be lifted up. The carpocratians, that's central to them.
2217720	2222440	They call themselves, they call them the ophites, the nascines. They're all snake,
2222440	2230520	nas means serpent in Hebrew. Ophite, serpent. These are, these nostics are getting their theology,
2230520	2233800	not just from making stuff up. They're getting it from the Bible.
2234280	2243400	Right. Right. And he is accused of being a mystic god in that process. The thing that I like about
2243400	2250360	the church as a classical philologist, I can completely ignore them. I can completely ignore
2250360	2256600	them. You can hit me with antinomy in this and this interpretation of that. It's all bullshit
2256600	2263000	because of the time, at the time that we have these documents that are talking about this cult
2263000	2269160	activity with Jesus, there are none of these people. They don't exist. Right. So if we go back
2269160	2275720	to that original context with your brain, the, the ophites, for example, yeah, the orphics,
2275720	2283480	that was the snake in the breast. That was their symbol. Right. Yeah. That was a snake in the breast.
2284040	2290680	So, and he says, the author of this letter says, Hey, um, you know that they're doing these things
2290680	2297000	and these awful things and we cannot, we cannot, uh, get involved. And he's like, even if he's
2297000	2304040	saying true stuff, you have to deny. Right. So there's probably, there might be a Christian
2304040	2310120	watching right now who's saying, Orphics, that's pagan. That has nothing to do with Christianity.
2310120	2317480	We'll check this out. Pseudopigrafa. This is all Bible. This is all Pseudopigrafa Bible text.
2317480	2324760	There's a whole section just dedicated to the Orphics. In fact, it goes even deeper than that.
2324760	2331560	The Orphics that were living in Alexandria, where are you going over who came first? Moses
2331560	2339560	or Orpheus? And then they, if you point to the text of Plato, Plato says, Mousseus is the son of Orpheus.
2340440	2346680	And so they're trying to wrestle with this idea that Moses can't be subservient to Orpheus. It's
2346680	2352680	got to be the other way around. And you see this back and forth happening in the first century,
2352680	2358920	where people are trying to claim Orpheus as their prophet. But we know the real Orpheus,
2358920	2364840	we know it really, Orpheus was a Dionysian high priest. He was the high priest of Bacchus
2365400	2371640	and the son of Apollo. He was connected, baby. Orpheus is the real deal. He's the poet. He's
2371640	2379880	the bard. He's the prophet telling the future. So you can't get these monotheists in the first
2379880	2386120	century are trying to claim him as one of their own. They're known. You can't do it down. This
2386120	2393320	is Bacchic. This is Pythagorean. This is, you know what I mean? This is, that's the real source.
2394440	2399880	Celsus is so gene. This is why I love Celsus. He's so brilliantly calls out the Christians.
2399880	2406040	You guys are just a degradation of the real thing. Just a degradation. He's like the real deal comes
2406040	2412920	out of Egypt. And the Christians are, they're Sybilist. But they're a degradation of the Sybilist.
2412920	2418040	And the Sybilist, the Sybilist religion is the religion of Rome. The Sybilian books. If you,
2418040	2423720	if you look at the history of the Sybilian books, the Sybilian books is what guides Rome and all
2423720	2429720	these wars against Carthaginians, against the Greeks, against whoever. The Sybilian books tells
2429720	2435400	them what to do. Go and import Magna Mater from Phrygia. Bring her into the temple. If you do this,
2435400	2439560	you'll win the war. And they're doing it. And it's all documented throughout history.
2440280	2446120	Third century, second century BCE, you see the Romans following these Sybilian books. And then
2446120	2450520	all of a sudden, third, second century, third century, the common era, all of a sudden, these
2450520	2454520	Sybilian books are just Christian now. They're not pagan anymore. They become Christianized.
2455240	2462040	So you see that this tradition, as Celsus points out, is a degradation of the original
2463000	2465880	pagan rites, these mystery rites.
2470280	2472040	Can I say, can I get an N?
2475160	2479160	Yeah.
2480360	2483400	Yeah, I fell out of there. Sorry about that. Am I back?
2483400	2485000	Yeah, you're, Ben, you're good.
2485000	2495560	Okay. It just my, you know, I was just wanting to say amen. Amen. Amen. And that locks it in.
2495560	2503320	I am the amen. I am the amen all over the world. There are Christians and they're
2503320	2511640	thanking the Lord Jesus Christ for their food. And they're saying in Jesus Christ's name, I pray, amen.
2512600	2522840	Don't realize that they are borrowing a pagan magic ritual in the pronunciation of that name.
2523640	2531640	That when they say amen, they are induced, they are introducing a Satanian or what I would call
2531640	2541400	Satanic magical device. When Jesus says the kingdom of Uranus, now you know why he talks
2541400	2548280	about the fire coming from Uranus because it's a pagan. Those are your mystery terms.
2548840	2555400	Those are your mystery terms. Jesus is not making up new stuff. For those of you out there who are
2556360	2563640	following the fairy tale of modern Christianity, be it Catholic or Protestant,
2564840	2574920	surprise, surprise. This is not a fairy tale and Jesus is there using the mystery in his own
2574920	2581320	direction. When he sits on the cross and he's yelling out, I'm thirsty. I'm thirsty. I'm thirsty.
2581320	2588920	Guess what? The physicians say this is what happens when you use the horned North African
2588920	2596520	viper venom. This is what you get. That's why they called it the dipsauce because it creates this
2596520	2604040	intense thirst. Not only is Jesus arrested with a naked boy, but he is on drugs and he's on mystery
2604040	2613800	drugs that we have reams of antidote in ancient Greek and Latin. We have reams of antidotes for
2613800	2621400	these things. The down and dirty picture of Jesus. Neil, do you think he's like the
2622040	2627240	Baptists who are out with their penis-shaped cups and their boys that they take out and
2627240	2636760	baptize? Do you think that's the group he's in? He's got his racket set up where he's got his
2636760	2644360	naked children, right? I want to go back to something you just mentioned because the oldest
2644360	2651560	source of the story of Moses that we have goes back to an Alexandrian priest in the fourth century
2652280	2662040	during one of the Ptolemy's reigns. He writes this story about Moses.
2664280	2669560	Supposedly, it's right before the Septuagint gets written. We had this story about this. The guy who
2669560	2678840	writes this story is an Egyptian pagan. He, in some of his texts, and I'm Corey's ancient fragments,
2678840	2683800	this is the text that I'm citing here, where he shows this guy is using this term,
2683800	2690920	hallelujah, amen, in some of his writings. Plutarch, in the first century, the second
2690920	2698200	century, the common era, he comments on this, on this exact person, and he says that he cites this
2698200	2705720	person. What's his name? Hang on, let me find his name. But anyways, while I'm finding his name,
2705720	2712680	this is what he says about him. He says that the word Amon, the god Amon, is the king of all the
2712680	2722440	gods of Egypt. He says that when Egyptians call on or call to any of the gods, not just Amon,
2723160	2732280	any of the gods, when they finish their prayers or when they're calling out to one another,
2733080	2743080	they use the term Amon. And we know that ancient Egyptian and ancient Hebrew, there is no vowels,
2744680	2751320	amen. So, some people, I'm one of them that this has been decided on by, a lot of scholars will
2751320	2755960	say that I'm going on fringe territory now. I don't care because I haven't heard any
2755960	2761240	better explanation of where that term comes from, better than what Plutarch says. It's in the
2761320	2767480	text, I'm Isis and Osiris, where he says that word Amon is the word that's used to
2769080	2775480	enchant and to call on any of the gods. So, I'm thinking that's your source right there.
2779560	2789800	So, when Jesus says, I am the amen, you can hear that he is deep in this thing. It's no wonder that
2789800	2797080	he would want to be called the Christ and what the Christ was because that is the one within
2797880	2805320	the right who is performing that mystery transformation, right? Oh my god, it's wonderful.
2805320	2812440	Drink of my blood, right? Love it. You know, they were doing that, right? So, it's not like
2813240	2818920	it's not like it's out of place. Beautiful. Yeah. Who's your amen?
2820680	2829880	Right, that term, amen. Yeah. It's fascinating though because I've only seen a few academics that
2829880	2835880	actually engage with this verse that Plutarch and I'm talking about from Isis and Osiris.
2836760	2842680	And the person that he cites is the person who writes the story about Moses,
2843560	2849720	pre-Bible. Like before the Septuagint is put together, this guy's writing stories about Moses
2850680	2855480	and it turns out that he's the guy who cites for this amen thing. So, I don't know. I don't know.
2855480	2859480	What do you guys think? And I'm interested to hear what people think about that.
2859480	2869880	We also have Olo Luzo. The verb in Greek, Olo Luzo, means to cry out in ecstasy. It can be,
2869880	2876200	it's usually like a... Oh, Hecateus. Sorry to cut you off. Hecateus of Abdera. I couldn't think of
2876200	2881560	the name but I found it now. Hecateus of Abdera. And going back, we're going back to ancient Egypt,
2881560	2887640	you know? Do you know how much it turns me on to have you quote Hecateus of Abdera?
2887720	2893800	That gives me hope for the world. I thought we were here to destroy it. You and I as two witnesses.
2893800	2902680	But that gives me hope, brah. And if anybody ever has anything bad about you, they can suck it
2902680	2907720	because you serve the muse, man. You bring back Hecateus. You're good. I love it.
2907720	2913480	You want to hear it? I got the passage from Plutarch right now. Plutarch says,
2914040	2921640	Moreover, the people believe that Amun is the name given to Zeus in the land of the Egyptians.
2922360	2931160	A name which we, with a slight alteration, hold on, you got to pause right there. Amun
2931960	2937880	with a slight alteration. He doesn't say what it is. It could be Amen. It could be Amzin.
2937960	2940680	He says slight alteration. Okay, remember that.
2942680	2952040	Pronounce Amun. But Menatho of Sabentus thinks that the meaning concealed or concealment
2952040	2958920	lies in the word. Hecateus of Abdera says the Egyptians use this expression, remember,
2958920	2965240	the altered form of Amun. So it's not Amun. It's an altered form of Amun. Like, come on,
2965240	2970360	dude, we have a slam dunk right here. I mean, let me finish this off. Egyptians express that
2970360	2978120	whenever they call to anyone for the word is a form of address, when they therefore
2979160	2986840	address the supreme God whom they believe to be the same as the universe as if he were invisible
2986840	2994920	and concealed and implore him to make himself visible and manifest, they use the alteration of
2994920	3004120	Amun. So great then was the circumspection of the Egyptians in their wisdom, touching that he has
3004120	3011000	to do with all the gods. And I've showed this to a couple of different academics and some of them
3011000	3016760	are like, wow, that's interesting. I think you're on to something. But I've never, it's just nobody,
3016760	3024040	it's like, that's it. It just ends there. Nobody's, everybody said, what does Amen mean? Oh, so,
3024040	3029800	it means so be it. It means so be it. According to who? Because that's, that's a later rendition.
3031800	3038280	Show me an ancient source before the Septuagint or before Christianity, where someone says that Amen
3038280	3044200	means so be it. What is your opinion now? You don't hear that until later. What's your opinion of
3044200	3048840	modern scholars? You've been interviewing them a bunch and you've had a whole, how about everything
3048920	3056600	from Harvard to, to whatever all over the place? What is your opinion? I don't want to come off as like,
3056600	3063960	some cocky amateur in my, in my house that's not these, these are I have respect for scholars,
3063960	3067880	because they put in the work and they are trained. But sometimes they're like this,
3068520	3073560	they only are looking at the thing that they're trained in. And they don't realize that some of
3073560	3078360	their stuff is overlapping. And some of these stuff, some of these scholars are overlapping with them.
3078360	3082200	And some of these scholars are, and they can't see it. That's why me and Derek try to bring
3082200	3086600	these scholars on together. Hey, look, you're looking at this. Hey, you're looking at this.
3086600	3091480	Look, here's two different pieces to a bigger puzzle. Not saying that I, not saying that I
3091480	3095480	know everything. And I'm not saying that at all. But I'm saying, I'm just saying my experience
3095480	3100760	was sometimes they can be like that. But I have respect for scholars. I love, they're, they're,
3100760	3106200	they're, they're brilliant people. Oh, of course, of course. But yeah, and I, that's what I'm,
3106200	3111000	that's all I'm getting at. I don't, if I can say it just for your audience.
3113240	3119640	I don't have any respect for scholars, especially the ones from the Ivy League,
3119640	3125960	especially the ones from the Ivy League. And it's not just me that thanks it. I have friends who
3125960	3130920	are professors. Well, you were a professor. You feel the same way. Yeah. And that's where I learned
3131080	3136440	as being a professor in going to international meetings. It's hilarious now. I went to,
3136440	3143160	I went to an international meeting in London and the London, I think we got bust up the Newcastle.
3143160	3148040	I can't remember where the actual meeting was, but the London Times came and of everybody's,
3148040	3153800	they, they watched and came to mind and said, this is the last frontier of classics,
3153800	3160040	because I was talking about drugs and I was talking about the pharmacological side. And
3160680	3166120	I fought for years against these classicists. Look, look at these texts. Somebody just opened
3166120	3173560	this text. You know, classicists mostly refuse to go to the New Testament. I don't know if you've
3173560	3179320	noticed it, but you, you're a religious studies scholars and whatnot. They're not classical
3179320	3185480	philologists. No. Classical philologists do not like to mess with the New Testament,
3185480	3190920	because they know, oh, there's a whole another group here who thinks they own the water, right?
3190920	3196200	It's like contested water. And if you go over there, China's going to shoot you with a missile or
3196200	3203000	something, right? So don't go over there. But yeah, Neil, if you can get these people to start
3203000	3209240	looking at it, like I would love to ask, why, why does nobody talk about the naked boy? I would
3209240	3217000	love to see you get with somebody from Harvard. You know, you just ask them straight out, a naked boy
3217720	3222840	seriously. Well, this is the thing. This is what, this is the thing about this. The God, everyone
3222840	3229320	agrees that the gospel of Mark is written where there's no, there's no extra fat. It's the shortest
3229320	3234360	of the gospels. It gets straight to the point. There is no extra biblical, there's no extra.
3235320	3241240	And they, it was five, like there's no extra information. Everything that Mark says has
3241240	3249080	some reason why it's there. Every, every syllable is there for a reason. So the fact that a little
3249080	3253640	boy runs away naked is not just like, I would just ignore that part. Just an extra information. No,
3253640	3258360	no, no, no, no, no, no. Mark is saying something here. We need to stop and look at it. What is
3258440	3264520	Mark trying to say? Not only that, not only that, Neil, I think that's a brilliant point, like something
3264520	3269880	that I would expect to, you know, that's what a scholar, you're doing what a scholar would do.
3269880	3276040	They're not doing their job. So you're doing it. You're exactly right about the concision of Mark.
3276680	3282200	I would take it even further and say, you've got more evidence because there is a much greater
3282200	3288840	concentration of Orphic mystery terminology in Mark than there is anywhere else. Almost
3288840	3296120	like you can take those areas that have that radiation, that Orphic radiation, and you can see
3296120	3303160	that other authors were saying, oh, we have to include this, but I'm going to blow it up into
3303160	3309800	something else. Right. You can, if you take a purple pen and you outline everything in the
3309800	3317480	Gospels that has to do with the mystery performance, you're going to see what's left over is the
3317480	3324680	garbage. Right. It's the, you can see consistently, if there's one thing we can say about Jesus,
3324680	3333240	just from an evidentiary standpoint, is the dude was way deep in a cult and he was way deep in a
3333240	3341720	mainstream death and resurrection mystery cult involving drugs and sex. Okay. If there's one
3341720	3349080	thing we can say from all of those purple markers, right, it's that. And I don't know,
3349080	3354120	do you ever get the sense that your guys in religious studies don't want to look at Jesus,
3354120	3361240	the Magus? Well, you know, I, so this is something that I've discussed with a lot of people is that
3362200	3366840	in religious studies in particular, just in religious studies, not in classicists and not
3367400	3373000	in, and not in full up, a lot of people, a lot of American biblical studies is
3373720	3380840	steered by the seminaries, by the churches, by the evangelical, the THD people,
3380840	3387640	not the THD, the THD people, the theology degree people. They're guiding the ship of biblical
3388040	3392920	in a lot of ways they are. I'm not saying that they had all the control, I'm not saying that it's
3392920	3398840	some, there's like a conspiracy to, you know, keep Christianity afloat. But I will say that there is
3398840	3406440	a lot of influencing by people with an agenda. And it's my personal opinion, feel free to disagree
3406440	3412200	in the comments. But that's how I see it right now. Do you think they've, this is something new,
3412200	3418760	or you think they've been doing this kind of crap for the last, I don't know, maybe 1600 years or
3418760	3424600	somewhere, somewhere around the times that Julian, the emperor, whom we both love, right? Neil's a
3424600	3431720	huge Julian fan, right? So am I. When that Christian soldier threw that spear into his back, fighting
3431720	3437560	over there with the Parthians. That was the, you were telling me just the other day about the
3438360	3443240	video about Julian. And I got to that part in his story. I had to take a stop and take a right,
3443240	3451480	like this changed history for the worst in my opinion. Because Julian was trying to bring back
3451480	3457880	that metropolitan Roman world where every city has their own God and every, everyone has the
3457880	3463560	right to worship their own God in their own way. And why did it take another 1500 years to get back
3463560	3470680	to that? And by the way, out of all people to rebuild and bring the Jews back to Jerusalem,
3470680	3477160	to where their temple is, he's the one that was going to do it. Julian was the last person that
3477160	3483960	said Jerusalem belongs to the Jews. And all the way up to 1948, no one did that, no Christian
3483960	3489240	emperor, no Christian emperor ever wanted to give Jerusalem back to the Jews. They wanted it for
3489240	3497800	themselves. But Julian was someone who understood that religion is personal. And so he's a hero,
3497800	3504920	in my opinion. We really lost a lot when Julian was taken down. Do you think that has anything to
3504920	3512040	do with the whole idea that they found Bacchic implements inside the temple and that temple
3512040	3518120	practice had become a, you know, there's a reason Plutarch, the priest of Apollo says
3518120	3523960	Judaism is Bacchic worship. And then he starts to talk about it in table talk, right? Then we lose
3523960	3530440	the rest of the document. As soon as he gets past the explains the pomegranates, he explains,
3530440	3535720	starts explaining the temple and what the priests are wearing and how it's all Bacchic.
3535960	3542520	You know what I think? We're talking about these academics who, they'll read this
3542520	3549720	passages by Tacitus and this is nonsense. But I think Tacitus is down to something
3549720	3559560	because you have this God Sabatios. Sabatios is identified as a form of Bacchus. But some
3559560	3563800	people have pointed out that Sabatios might be related to, he's the god of the Sabbath.
3564760	3570600	So you had this Sabbath God, who's like Bacchus, but a little bit more different, a little more,
3571160	3575800	you know, a little more institutional. And there's, there's, it's quite possible
3576600	3583320	that Yahweh has some links to Sabatios. It's a Phrygian father God. You know, he's like a Zeus.
3583320	3590600	He's like a Saturn. He's like Yahweh. Yahweh, Yahweh of the Sabbath might be the Sabatios.
3590600	3593240	There might be some connection there. That's all I'm saying.
3593240	3597720	Aren't they always trying to run out people? They're like, pull down that temple where all the
3597720	3603320	sex stuff goes on and stuff like that. And they're trying to change. I don't understand.
3603320	3609640	It seems like that's the inner mysteries are when, when you get deeper into any religion,
3609640	3614760	the inner mysteries is always something like some phallus or something. Some in the middle of a
3614760	3621240	temple or the Holy of Holies is supposed to be, there's the phallus, you know, the, the, the sacred.
3621240	3628120	There's a reason, you know, there's a reason we need the virgin, right? And all of the, all of the
3628760	3634840	imagery around the, the virgin mother, people think the virgin mother started with Mary. It doesn't.
3635640	3644040	It doesn't, right? Neither does her power to carry the purple. The, the nurse that stuck her
3644040	3651480	fingers into Mary's vagina on the Coptic side pulls out the burning purple. It burns her hands,
3651480	3659640	right? There's some transfer, you know, you were talking about symbols and you were talking about
3660760	3667720	Rome and how important Rome is that Roman mystery is the foundation. That's why you look at the
3667720	3675400	apocalypse and you see Rome, right? The, the, the seven hills are there for a reason. It's because
3675400	3683480	they developed the mystery and Numa is taking it from this girl named Egeria, who apparently lives
3683480	3691080	for a thousand years, but looks like she's a teenager the whole time. And he takes those books
3691080	3698440	and he buries them, right? When he dies, he's like, she told me everything. The future of the city of
3698440	3703320	Rome, what would happen? And it was huts, you know, I mean, it was nothing, well, it was more than
3703320	3710360	huts, but, um, and they buried those books, right? And on his instructions as death, they dug them
3710360	3715720	up years later, took them to the Senate and the Senate was like, Oh my God, we have to get rid of
3715720	3722600	these things. So when the Christians come along and they're calling them civilists,
3723320	3729160	you know, it's, those traditions are not, there's a, there's a reason for Peter and Rome,
3729720	3736600	right? And it's a mystic reason. It's a mystic reason that goes right back to Jesus getting
3736600	3745560	arrested with that kid. It's not odd. Heracles has one, right? God himself has one. He's
3745560	3749720	got his boy. You know, they talk about in that dirty poetry that you were talking about,
3749720	3756280	they talk about what it is to pull a Ganymede. That means to drink out of a boy's anus.
3756280	3763160	The nectar. Yeah. I read that. I saw that go from straight toe. And this is like, these were like
3763160	3769400	popular porn, basically. It's like the ancient version of porn. And that's what they were,
3769400	3774920	and that's the imagery is like Zeus and Ganymede and Apollo and Hayekinth. And
3775640	3779800	there's a lot of that going on. And it's just, that's the, this is what we, this is the context
3779800	3784680	that I think should be mandatory for people to realize before they even look at these texts.
3784680	3790840	Yeah. Look what you've done too. Your audience should appreciate the fact that you have not
3790840	3797560	had the benefit of Harvard education, yet you are able to swim those currents and access that
3797560	3804760	information. And now you're, you're, you're going beyond where they're capable of going.
3805400	3815320	And that's, you know, that's amazing. I would have you in, as my trench warrior anytime, anytime.
3817480	3821640	The sources don't lie. Yeah. And here's the thing, even if the sources are wrong,
3822280	3827400	even when Herodotus tells a story that might not be true, there's something that story tells
3827560	3833080	us something about the time. Right. So when Herodotus is saying that there's one eyed men
3833080	3837480	in gold guarding griffins living in the North where the hyperboreans are, that might not be a
3837480	3843320	true statement, but it tells us of how the Greeks thought of the Scythians. They thought of a magical
3844120	3849640	fairy land up there and it was dark and there's forests were scary and there was monsters creeping
3849640	3855400	out. That's how the Greeks thought of the, the North. Herodotus captures that. That's why I'm
3855400	3860440	saying even the primary sources, even if they're not true, they're, they tell us more about the
3860440	3867720	context of the time than any modern theory can tell us. There's a, there's a dragon that guards a
3867720	3875320	tree. Everybody knows about him. It's in the grove of Mars and on the tree hangs a skin,
3876120	3883960	right, of a ram and on it is written the sacred song. Right. That's the cibulations. They're
3884040	3891720	all captured there and that dude walks around. He's blind. First of all, but he walks around
3891720	3898200	with poison that he can spit. He can use on arrows. He can do whatever he wants. And if you get near
3898200	3904760	it, he'll kill you immediately. The Greeks couldn't conquer. They went to, they went to Troy with all
3904760	3909720	their big fights and we know about Bronze Age combat. We can put the limny and steel up here,
3909800	3915800	you know, harkening back to the Bronze Age with the combat. Yeah, but what's really, what's really
3915800	3923800	courageous? What's really courageous? It's Odysseus with his arrow poison. Having Cersei put him into
3923800	3930600	a death state and you didn't know that. You're like, what? That's not part of the, of the Odyssey.
3930600	3938120	Yes, it is. Cersei, like Jesus, turns a bunch of soldiers into pigs. Right. She raises from the
3938120	3945240	dead. Did you know she says, John Tsitsi says in lycophron is indicating the resurrection
3945960	3955000	of Odysseus. Odysseus is Jesus a long time, a millennium before Jesus was millennium.
3955000	3958840	He was the hero of the Greeks. That's what everybody thought of. He was the example.
3960520	3967160	What you're getting at is so true. And in fact, Derek Lambert was in the chat. I saw, he left
3967240	3973640	the comment asking if you've seen Dennis McDonald's, Dennis McDonald's. So Dennis McDonald's put
3973640	3981080	together all of the mimesis from Homer. That's in the Gospels. And so I want to just give you one
3981080	3987480	example. Just, just to get your reaction. It's about Cersei too, by the way. And I just want to,
3987480	3991720	if you don't mind, I just want to get your reaction. I think you really appreciate this.
3991720	3995800	I really do. I really think you will. So Dennis McDonald put this together. Look at this. Can
3995800	4000760	you read this or not? I'll read it to you if you can't see it. Yeah. No, I got it. Odysseus in his
4000760	4006920	crew sailed to the land of the Cyclops and of Cersei. Jesus and his disciples sailed to the
4006920	4011640	region of the garrisons. All right. So we have two people, two different stories, people sailing.
4011640	4015880	You might be, all right. That's not a big deal. But let's look at the sequence here. On the mountains
4015880	4023080	of the Cyclops is innumerable goats grazed. Cersei turned soldiers into swine. On the mountain,
4023320	4028920	now back to Mark. On the mountain, a large herd of swine grazed. Okay. Odysseus and his crew
4028920	4035080	disembarked. Jesus and his crew disembarked, the same Greek word. They encounter a savage,
4035080	4042360	lawless giant who lived in a cave. Jesus encounters a savage, lawless demoniac who lived among the
4042360	4051720	caves. Polyphemus usually was depicted nude. The demoniac was nude. Now Cersei recognizes Odysseus
4051720	4059640	and asks him not to harm her. Swear an oath. Orcon, not to plan another plot to hurt me.
4059640	4067400	The giant Ask Odysseus intended to harm. The demoniac recognizes Jesus and uses that same
4067400	4075080	root word, orcidso, right? Is that how you say it? Orquico? Orquizo, yes. Orquizo. You not to
4075080	4080840	torment me. So we have, all right. So we have these, the sequence of events is lining up here.
4080840	4087560	Let's keep going. The giant asks Odysseus his name. Jesus asks the demoniac his name. Odysseus
4087560	4095800	answers, nobody is my name. The demoniac answers Jesus. Legion is my name. Odysseus subdues the
4095800	4102200	giant with violence and trickery. Cersei's magic turned Odysseus's soldiers into swine.
4103000	4111000	Jesus subsdues 2,000 demons with divine power and sent them into the swine and drove the swine
4111000	4117960	into a lake. This is lining up perfectly. Polyphemus, the shepherd calls out to his neighbors.
4117960	4123320	The swine herds call out to their neighbors. The Cyclops is coming and the site asking Polyphemus
4123320	4129320	for stolen sheep. The garrisons come to the site to find out about their swine. Odysseus and his
4129320	4135400	crew embark. Jesus and his crew embark. And Odysseus tells the giant's proclaim that he had
4135400	4142440	blinded him. Jesus tells the healed demoniac to proclaim what God had done for him. Now this is
4142440	4149800	just so, it's the same story being retold through a different lens, through a different time,
4149800	4154840	through a different character. Odysseus and Jesus. You also had the idea of Jesus's feet
4154840	4161800	being anointed by Eurycleia. Jesus' feet are being anointed by Mary and then he says to her,
4161800	4169320	you're famed we told far and wide, which Eurycleia, the girl who anointed Odysseus' feet,
4169320	4175400	that name Eurycleia in Greek means famed far and wide. Jesus is only putting a pun on the name.
4177160	4181800	It's too much. It's too good. I thought you'd get a kick out of that.
4181800	4187800	Yeah, no, I get a big kick out of that. I like to stay in the shallow waters that are just
4188520	4194120	linguistic. So I'm thinking about his use of the verb there. I'm not impressed with the boarding
4194840	4199880	and the turn of phrases that are the same. I can do that with a whole bunch of texts. It doesn't
4199880	4208840	mean they're related. But the content of the progression of the narrative is you have to,
4208840	4216360	I have to agree, there's a lot of overlap there. It's the sequence of the events that line up.
4217240	4221080	They're not scared. They're lined up the sequence. You know what I mean? What if, Neil,
4221080	4229320	there's also a connection with the, for example, Jason, right? Jason, yeah, his name is Iason.
4229320	4235080	It is, I keep telling people this, it is the name Jesus and they don't, because they want to say no,
4235080	4243400	it's Joshua. And I want to say no, because this name is part of a religious right that predates.
4243400	4248680	It goes all the way back to Mycenaeus. Bronze Age, right? So it's not coming from the Hebrew.
4248680	4256280	It can't be. There is none. And to add to what you're saying, both of the roots of those words
4256280	4263400	have to do with healing. Jason Healer, Joshua, even Joshua in Hebrew has to do with healing.
4263480	4267240	So they're both, both of these words are coming from a common source.
4267240	4274680	I think that's what that Pulaskean is. I think that, I don't think it's that the Jews didn't have it.
4274680	4279720	I think it's that, just like the Egyptians, the Egyptians that absorbed it from 3000 BC.
4279720	4284200	Mediterranean language, all overlapping, all the Mediterranean languages.
4284200	4290840	And Neil and I are not just making up these Pulaskeans. These are a real people. And the
4290840	4296200	Georgians will tell you, these are the early Georgians who's, you know, anyway, good stuff.
4296200	4300280	After the Bronze Age collapse, it's the Pulaskeans that are populated in the Mediterranean.
4301080	4305480	It makes you think if there's some kind of movement, some of those migrations
4306040	4313080	cause that sudden change in the population. I don't know, because I mean, why are they calling
4313080	4318360	them Autochthonous, right? Why is everybody referring to them as the original people?
4318360	4325080	When we talk about Jewish migration, that's not unusual, right? It's, we watch, we sit down, Neil,
4325080	4331160	and we watch our, our, Charlton Heston, every Easter. We're about to have him come out.
4331160	4335960	And for all I know, he's doing it tonight. And he's spreading his arms and he's making
4335960	4341800	the seed part, right? We're moving these people, right? Guess what? These migrations happen all
4341800	4350760	the time, right? So this is a dynamic of the world. It wasn't that Jehovah is Jewish, right?
4350760	4356200	This is coming through. When Jehovah tells Moses, he's like, set up this tent and you're
4356200	4361320	going to go in this tent. My voice will be there. Boom. It's a Talistarian.
4361320	4367800	The second voice of God, right? Right. He's, he's working from tradition. He's not bringing
4367800	4373640	them out ex nihilo. That's what I'm saying. This, this was a, the way they, the way Leviticus
4374520	4380200	just prescribes how the priest is supposed to come in and, you know, sacrifice the bull
4380200	4386280	and sprinkle the blood seven times on the altar. These are straight from the ancient pagan world
4386280	4392120	on how to get an oracle from a different God, any God. Yeah. Whatever you set up their tent,
4392120	4399560	you set up their, their, their oracle with, with the, with the altar the same way. So the way,
4399560	4404680	the way they're worshiping Jehovah is no different than somebody in Phrygia is worshiping
4404680	4411800	Sabazios or somebody in the, in Libya worshiping Ammon. They're all doing it the same way.
4411800	4419000	Yes. And that Neil is what this letter of Pseudo-Clement mentions. It says they're showing them
4419080	4425000	the attitum. That's that space that you're trying to preserve for the oracle. You're
4425000	4433320	performing the mystery, right? So I don't know why Christians don't put more value and actually
4433320	4440440	looking at what their texts are saying, right? Rather than reading everything through the last
4440440	4448600	16, well, the last 1800 years of Christianity. They're afraid of being like a pagan.
4448600	4454760	Yeah. Like, why? That's if you want to do religion, do it right. Yeah. These are, these are ancient
4454760	4461160	traditions that are going back to before we had writing. And it's the same, it's the same traditions,
4461960	4467080	you know, evolving basically, evolving over time. So what are you scared of? It's the same. It's,
4467080	4472280	you're just following the history, you know, I would love to tell every Christian in the group,
4472280	4479960	if I could address every Christian out there and tell them, I've been to the texts and I can tell
4479960	4489560	you there is no such thing as eternal life. It does not exist. What Jesus himself promised
4491160	4500760	was Ionic life. And Ionic life is a place within the operation of the mystery.
4501480	4507400	So he was saying, straight up, get the same phrase in the Orphic. What is that,
4507400	4515160	that papyrus, devouring papyrus? And I proclaim Ionic life. Orphi says it.
4516760	4521880	It's the ion, right? And Christians don't get that because they hear just through an accident of
4521880	4529080	history and the translating. And it wasn't so accidental because the church fathers had a lot
4529080	4536200	of poll on how we'll set our doctrine and our ideas. And as soon as you get doctrine and ideas,
4537160	4542280	you're, excuse me, you're live, so I'm not going to be rude about it, but you're in a bad place.
4542840	4548680	Your vision is obscured from the actual evidence because that's what we get in the actual evidence.
4549400	4560120	So there's no salvation, right? There is the soter. There is the soteria. And the first soteria
4560120	4570360	is described in the Orphic hymns to this female divinity who is a virgin mother, right? So you
4570360	4576920	can see how the Orphics would be able to grasp. She's also the light bringer, the Luciferia.
4576920	4584040	Exactly. Right? The light bringer, which is what they call Diana up in the Crimea. People were
4584040	4588920	like asking the other day on the channel, where's the Diana of Nemus? Where is she from in Italy and
4588920	4593720	all that next, you know, we're talking about the lake and all that kind of stuff. All this stuff
4593720	4603080	is coming from that Diana who lives in the Crimea. And she has the right of sacrifice. Any stranger
4603720	4611880	that washes the shore, she kills them. She kills them in a right. Why? Because she was killed
4612760	4619240	in a right. They're perpetuating the same priesthood. So, and for those of you who are Christians,
4619240	4624840	the mystery is not a question. It's not a secret. The mystery is an operation
4625640	4633720	that these religions are doing. It is a practice. So when you hear mystery and Paul the Apostle is
4633720	4640280	talking about mystery, you are not hearing what they were saying. I tell this to my seminarians
4640280	4646280	every year because I feel bad. Feel bad for the Christians. I tell them, I say, you have not read
4646280	4653000	the Bible. You think you have, but you have not. Neil knows that once you start looking at the Greek,
4653800	4657800	then it all of a sudden opens up and I'm not talking about the stuff that comes canned
4657800	4662920	out of a seminary. I'm not talking that. I'm talking about the stuff that you need that'll
4662920	4668280	allow you to read ancient medical texts or ancient epics or anything like this.
4668280	4675080	This is, this is Kalamikis, Kalimakis written around the same time as the Septuagint was
4675080	4682520	translated, right? So it's that Alexandrian 3rd century BCE Greek. In here, there's a hymn to
4682520	4691240	Artemis. So this is, we're talking, and it says, she is quoting her saying, I want to be a virgin
4691240	4700760	forever and let me be the light bringer, Luciferia. The virgin light bringer, Soteria, a savior,
4701320	4707640	virgin, light bringer, all these tropes that you see with the Christ. It's already being
4707640	4716520	applied to these other gods way before Diana, who's Artemis, is a savior, virgin, goddess.
4717960	4724680	It's just, this is all, this is, it's, this is the way religion is done. Christianity can just
4724680	4729240	pop up out of nowhere and start this new thing that no one's heard of before and no one's done.
4729240	4737080	This is the, this is business as usual. Nothing different is going on here. Just, this became the
4737080	4741960	religion of the West, became the Roman Empire's state religion. So everybody thinks it's special
4741960	4746520	now, but like, it could have been, it could have been any of these, any of these traditions that
4746520	4754760	made it that way. You know? They called it the way. They called it the way. Oh, don't, oh, don't.
4755720	4762680	Yep. Yeah. And that's what, when you're walking it, when you're engaging that mystery,
4763240	4768760	you understand. And it puts you in a place where when he said Soteria, when he said salvation,
4769320	4775640	people would have understood, right? And then what's really creepy, what's really creepy,
4775640	4781000	you know, everything about this, that says that there are certain things that we have to deny,
4781640	4787880	right? Certain things we have to deny. I don't want you telling people. When Jesus is talking,
4787880	4794040	preaching, you get your funny Western vision of him standing on the hill in his sheet, right?
4794040	4800040	And he's not like this and he's like, my people, you know, blessed are the meek, right?
4801240	4810360	Wait a minute. Is this the same Jesus who walks around speaking in analog so that people won't
4810440	4815160	understand what he's saying? It's not so that they will. Jesus doesn't walk around saying,
4815160	4821000	I'm going to give you an example. It's a metaphor for you to figure out, right? So it'll further
4821000	4827880	explain what I'm saying. He doesn't say that. It says he purposely kept them. It's so that the
4827880	4835960	people who are outside, those who are not initiated, remember, he is a mystagogue. The letter says,
4835960	4843800	Jesus, the mystagogue, it's in there. So what do we, you know, he fits the profile perfectly.
4843800	4848760	And you got the hero fan thing, too. Yeah, yeah. All the titles that he's getting,
4848760	4854120	in the revelation, the author of the revelation calls him Lucifer. Yeah. Calls him the son of
4854120	4859400	the morning, the dawn. That's Lucifer. Right. He's the morning star. He's the morning star. He's
4859400	4864920	getting all the same titles. He's getting all these mystery religion titles. Yeah. Yeah. So if
4865000	4870040	he is, and if, you know, in the book of revelation, a lot of Christians don't realize it, but in the
4870040	4881720	book of revelation, he's wearing a woman's nightie. He's wearing a bra that is made for a woman. And
4881720	4889560	it says it's around his breasts. And it's the Greek word for the feminine breasts. Has it been used
4889640	4894200	for males before? That's where people are like, wait a minute, wait a minute. But the thing that
4894200	4902040	he puts around them that, that it's usually translated as girdle, that's a part of his kit
4902040	4907800	that is the morning star's kit. And the morning star is originally a woman. The morning star is
4907800	4917240	originally Urania. And so if Urania, the morning star has this kingdom, and the word Urania there
4917320	4923560	is the word for heaven, right? She is the one in charge of the heavenly kingdom. Jesus is just
4923560	4930360	taking that machinery and bringing it to himself. Does it make sense then that he has to be with the
4930360	4937240	naked boy at four a.m.? Yeah, because he's deriving an antidote for a cup that apparently at the time
4937240	4944600	he doesn't want to take. He knows how crazy this is, what they're doing. Right. He says that in the
4944600	4951080	same chapter he says, take this cup away from me. No one knows what he's talking about. It's all
4951080	4958200	there in chapter 14. He just brought it back full circle to me. All the language is there. So if you
4958200	4965240	were some, if you were an Alexandrian initiates in the first century, and someone brought this text
4965240	4969160	marked to you, you're reading 14, you would, you would know exactly what this is. You would say,
4970120	4975320	I know what's going on here. There wouldn't be this big question like we're here today in 2023.
4975960	4983560	No, no, no. The Greek ear of the first century would know what this is. They would understand
4983560	4988520	right away. And if you weren't in the group, you weren't initiated. Maybe you weren't one of those
4988520	4994360	boys that went through the process, but you were on the outside, and you knew this is a thing about
4994440	5001480	hearing, you know, and there's code. And you saw Romans coming into Alexandria, arresting
5002360	5008680	Christians for taking little kids off the street. Right. They're arresting Christians
5009320	5017640	for abducting and abusing children. Right. If you didn't have ears to hear, you'd be like those
5017720	5024920	cultists. Right. Well, you'd know, you'd know this is part of the deal. And people don't realize
5024920	5031560	my religion, the religion that I'm trying to replace my democracy with its deocracy,
5031560	5040440	that is built upon pederasty. It is built upon dudes getting arrested in public parks
5040440	5045960	at 4am and saying, why are you coming at me with all the weapons? I'm not dealing any kids here.
5048200	5055480	Dude, that's such, that's exactly what it is, man. That's crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Somebody actually
5056600	5061400	super chatted before you even brought up the secret mark chat GPT. Thanks for the super chat.
5061400	5066280	It's the same kid from the secret gospel of mark. This is before you even brought that up. So
5066280	5073080	kudos to chat GPT for being on it like that. Yeah. That's a good point. But um, yeah, this was
5073640	5078440	draw. Oh, snappy. Oh, thank you for the super chat. Love you guys. Please talk about what happens
5078440	5085160	in the sacred groves. Ammon gives us the mystery all the best. This is what it's all about. Because
5085160	5091240	we didn't even mention this. We're in the sacred grove to begin with this chapter. They go to get
5091240	5098040	sent me. That's a sacred grove. I've been there. I've been to Israel. I went to the Garden of
5098040	5103880	the Assembly. You know what's right next to it? A giant cemetery. It's a sacred grove. You don't
5104680	5112520	a sacred grove is a garden next to a cemetery. Period. They're in the sacred grove and snappy is
5112520	5121720	onto something here because mystery cults perform their rights oftentimes in a sacred grove. Yes.
5121720	5128120	And that Timonus that right that Timonus that place that you cut, it's literally the place that you
5128120	5136840	cut off from the what we would call the secular world, right? It's the place where that divinity
5136840	5143160	and all those places they have some source or some power. It's usually like a spring when Numa
5143720	5153640	whose name if you were to write it in Etruscan would say amen. When Numa went to his meetings
5153640	5163320	with Nigeria, the thousand year old purple using Etruscan Wates priestess who they say came.
5164440	5170040	Anyway, divine. They talk about a divinity. When he when he was doing his thing, it's the same
5170040	5180840	process, right? That they're entering into and that power he goes to he goes to Nigeria at a sacred
5180840	5191640	place at a place with a little spring, right? A garden. It's sometimes described as a garden.
5192360	5197320	Yeah. And it still exists. We have the niche in Rome where this was.
5198440	5204520	Gorgeous. Love it. But yeah, he's there in this cemetery. Notice every time he's getting caught
5204520	5211000	is in the cemetery. Even Cyprian, you know, comes stumbles out of the cemetery with the
5211720	5219880	says the venom coming out of his bottom out of his anus, right? Those places, those burials,
5219880	5227880	you know, those those wild centers, right? Yeah, this Garden of Gethsemane is a real,
5227880	5234520	you know, it's a real place to hang out with with naked boys. I mean, that's this is me.
5234520	5239960	When I was in Israel, I took got some footage of the garden and there's Christians flocking
5239960	5244680	around. Obviously Christians from all over the all over the world flocking here. That's
5244680	5249720	and supposedly in a thousand year old tree or whatever. But I was more interested and I want
5249720	5252840	to know what's going on inside this church right next to it. They build right next to it. It's a
5252840	5258600	Catholic church they got. And sure enough, they have the image of the arrest right in the middle
5258600	5264040	of the church is the image of the arrest. They had the different scenes going on. There's him
5264040	5269880	sitting there. And then look, they have there's there's the arrest right there. And there's
5270120	5277720	your there's your boy right there. So this is there this they got this place in they have a
5277720	5285160	church built all based on chapter 14. It's all the scenes of chapter 14 are on the walls in the
5285160	5290440	church. How come my kids not naked, Neil? He's supposed to be naked. You know, you know, they
5290440	5294520	would never that's that's revealing. That's probably in the that's probably in the back room.
5294520	5303400	They probably have that. That's the inner mystery. See how powerful it is. If you control the text
5304040	5309400	and you control the information, you can tell anybody anything you want. Neil, you were telling
5309400	5315640	me the other day, you were saying, Hey, there's this Antikythera thing, this computer thing
5315640	5321800	that the big school working out and then tons of dark ages that follow it. You know, it makes you
5321800	5326200	wonder. I think I just want to bring up your point. Oh, let me let me let me add to what you're
5326200	5330920	saying right now. Check this out. So I'm going to share my screen. I'm going to go over here.
5331720	5337240	And because no, this is such a good point. Antikythera mechanism. Okay, look at this.
5338120	5346440	This is a hand powered analog computer that used to predict astronomical positions
5346440	5353800	and eclipses decades in advance. Okay, this was received from a shipwreck and it's dated to the
5353800	5361640	third century BCE. Okay, second century BC. Sorry. All I'm saying is, if this is what the Greek world
5361640	5371800	was producing with paganism at the helm, why is it that it took a 2000 years after Christianity
5371800	5380440	rose out and became the central culture, as you will, where knowledge is considered evil?
5380440	5385320	Let's go right to Genesis one. The tree of knowledge is evil. You know, it's better to just
5385320	5391720	worship and pay your your 10% and, you know, you know, give all of our resources to the church and
5391720	5396440	let the church guide us through the as the light in the darkness. That was the way that people
5396440	5402760	lived in Western society for 1500 years. And there is no no one building computers.
5403400	5410840	They were already doing this before that. So I'm arguing that Christianity kind of held
5410840	5416200	the world back a little bit. My night might disagree. Go ahead. You feel free to disagree
5416200	5421320	all you want. That's my personal opinion is that I think there would be a lot quicker
5421400	5428840	advancements if we let if the metropolitan way continued. That makes sense.
5431320	5437880	Yeah, we certainly wouldn't have been putting guys like Galileo in prison and whatnot. And
5437880	5444760	that's what I don't get, Neil. Why does the modern American audience not understand that this thing
5444760	5451880	that you relish and that you celebrate worship and love because you know, you do democracy.
5451880	5458280	You love this thing called democracy. And you don't realize it didn't come from Christianity.
5458280	5466680	Christianity overthrew democracy. It's spirit across the world. Christianity suppressed.
5466680	5472120	It was a thing back in the fourth century Athens, the fourth century BCE Athens.
5473080	5477960	It was a literally literal democracy, more democratic than we ever know.
5479480	5485640	Yeah, it's radical. It's radical, right? When you are there and you have the ability to make
5485640	5491880	the choice that you don't have somebody telling you, this is your God, right? The things were
5491880	5499080	like screw everything. We're worshiping a virgin and people are free. People are free here and
5499160	5505240	people say debate. Oh, well, to what degree did they have freedoms? Forget you. The fact
5505240	5513480	is, they were fighting for that freedom. And that freedom is the same thing. You find it again
5513480	5521720	in this letter of Pseudo-Clement. He talks about the Eleutheria that is part of the mystery,
5521720	5529320	that complete unassailable freedom. And that is always, Bacchus is always protecting the virgin.
5529320	5534200	There's a reason and Athens is where that first theater is. People don't realize it. There are
5534200	5541240	no Christians that invented the theater. They didn't, doesn't happen, will never happen, right?
5541240	5547880	It was the Greeks who worshiped the virgin, who came up with democracy, who had the theater
5547880	5555720	constructed. And it was just a place to land the Bacchic procession. It was just a place to
5555720	5561480	land the Bacchic procession. That's where we get democracy. So when anybody stands up today and
5561480	5570600	tells you, God has blessed the USA, no, no, the virgin, right? The virgin has blessed us. Yeah,
5571320	5574840	yeah. We need to preserve that. We need to preserve that.
5574840	5580360	Yeah. Could this have been a Paul teaching? Because Paul was more of a mystery teaching
5580360	5591080	than Joshua. Mark traveling with Paul. It's interesting. It's interesting. Maybe. I'm not
5591080	5597080	really, that's, what do you think? Do you have any opinion on that? I will. Neil, I'm going to be super
5597080	5602920	rude, but you know my contract with the devil. I can't discuss. I'm going to take a break and
5604680	5610280	you, because I understand, hey, everybody who's out there, no criticism. I understand this is
5610280	5619320	part of how this runs as a way to feed Neil and to keep his journalism, because this is better
5619320	5625800	than, this is not just YouTube show. This is journalism that you're doing. This is historical
5625800	5631160	journalism. I'm going to give you a chance to answer all of your, take a break and come back and
5631160	5638120	yeah, you're fine. I'll be back. I'll be back. All right. So now this is a good question, Durin.
5638120	5647560	I thought, because yeah, Paul, he has a lot of, the way Paul is interacting with the world that
5647560	5655560	he's living in, is he is extending his hand to the pagan world and saying, you know, if you're
5655560	5661480	with a people in a crowd and they're offering a, you know, they're offering to, you know, meet
5661480	5670360	sacrifice to idols, we're all Romans here. Let's, let's chill. Let's, let's relax. So yeah, you might
5670360	5676120	be on to something there. This might be a Pauline thing for all we know. I'm not sure the question
5676120	5684040	is how much is the gospel of Mark connected to Paul and maybe there's a big connection. Maybe
5684040	5689560	there isn't. That's where the question is. So that's what I would look into. That's a good question
5689560	5696200	though. I never thought about that. How much is Mark taking from Paul? Good question, actually.
5696200	5701000	Really good question because we all, it's, it's already established that Mark comes after Paul.
5701720	5709880	So your, your question is, is a spot on. It deserves to be explored for sure.
5710840	5719640	Oh, let's see. The next one is from evangelicals never lie with a giant super chat. Wow.
5720840	5728280	Thank you. Thank you. I so appreciate this. Thank you that you did not have to do that.
5728280	5732600	And I appreciate it. And I really, really, I can't even say how much I appreciate it.
5732680	5738840	Ben, a while since I bought you don't says I bought you don't pissed me. Hold on.
5738840	5742440	Am I reading this right? Ben, a while since I bought you don't pissed.
5743640	5748680	Great stuff, dude. Very interesting. Well, I appreciate it so much. I really,
5748680	5755240	I can't even just words cannot describe how much I appreciate this. And uh,
5756360	5759880	yeah, I, you, you, and like, like, I don't know what type of before he left this.
5759880	5765560	You're the reason why I'm allowed to be doing this and drop daily videos. And I'm trying to
5765560	5771800	keep up that pace is just, I'm just working and you know, these, the days when I go live are
5771800	5778520	actually my days off from putting together like edited content. So the next video I have coming
5778520	5783800	out next, um, before I get to the next super chat, I just want to show you guys the next video.
5784440	5788360	I'll give, I'll actually, I'll show you my, um, thumbnail. That's what I'll do.
5789320	5796280	I'll show you the thumbnail, the thumbnail for my next video. Wait, do I even have it?
5802280	5809880	Um, maybe I don't have it with me. But anyways, the next video I'm doing is about Lucifer.
5810680	5816760	How does Lucifer become Satan? You're probably asking, what do you mean Satan is Lucifer?
5816760	5823000	No, no, no, no, no Lucifer started off as a totally different thing is from the Roman religion side.
5823000	5830280	Lucifer is Lucifer is the male version of Venus. How does Lucifer become Satan?
5831480	5837720	And how does Lucifer become the devil? How does Satan become the devil? All of that.
5837720	5840840	There's a, there's a three different questions that are being asked. There's aren't the same
5841800	5848680	Satan is in the, and there's a Jewish context of Satan being the accuser. There's also this root
5848680	5854200	word of set. There's also this different devil characters. There's also underworld gods like
5854200	5861000	Pluto and Hades. And then there's Lucifer, who's a light bringer who's not evil at all.
5861960	5865160	And then you also have fallen gods that get in trouble like Prometheus.
5865880	5869720	You have Apollo getting in trouble and falling down to earth and being,
5869720	5875560	so you have these different traditions. And that's my next video coming out next.
5875560	5882760	How does Lucifer become the devil? And Chthonius is, this is the last super chat I'm on, so you
5882760	5888840	don't have to, you can chill for this one. Chthonius says, if Jesus would have succeeded,
5888840	5896920	what would have happened to the boy, Ganymede, or sacrifice or initiate, would he have been holy?
5899240	5905000	Wow. Chthonius, Chthonius is going deep into the mysteries. I know Chthonius personally,
5905560	5913160	and this is someone who really, really likes to study this stuff. So, um, yeah, if Jesus would
5913160	5921160	have happened to the boy, Ganymede, or sacrifice or initiate, would he have been holy? Yeah,
5922200	5927880	right? Isn't that how that works? I'm guessing. Christine Wilson, next for the Super Sticker.
5927880	5931400	Appreciate you so much. Appreciate you so much. Amon, what do you think about all this?
5933320	5938920	I just came back to the devil. I heard you talking about the devil, and I love it, Neil.
5939640	5944280	That's the video that I'm coming out with, either tomorrow, let me just say, actually,
5944280	5949320	it won't be ready by tomorrow morning, but it might be ready by tomorrow evening. If not by
5949320	5957080	tomorrow evening, the next, the 21st morning, Tuesday morning, that video will be done.
5957720	5965560	Promise that. And it's, when does Lucifer become the devil? And it's deep, I'm going deep into
5965560	5973160	this one, because there's a lot of explaining to do. It's not simple. Yeah. Bring the dawn,
5973160	5981080	brother. Bring the dawn. Yeah. Yeah. Love it. Love it. People are shocked when they find out the
5981080	5987560	venous, you know, is the devil. People are kind of shocked at first. I don't know. You get down
5987560	5994520	there and she's got a skirt on, right? And you may think one way, you may have been taught one
5994520	6000760	tradition, but when you get down there, the devil and realize as you lift up that Mediterranean
6002120	6014360	short skirt, there is a large penis there. This is, this is Venus, the mother of the Roman people,
6015240	6022680	right? It's fantastic. And to go even deeper than that, because you know how in the Greek religion,
6023400	6031000	when you have two gods that, that, that mates, have sex, whatever, and create an offspring,
6031000	6037160	God, oftentimes those two, it's, it's, there's a reason for the genealogy. You have two different
6037160	6046760	priesthoods coming together. Venus and Dionysus have an offspring. You know exactly where I'm
6046760	6051320	going with this. Yeah. Go for it. Sing it, brother. This is one of the most important mystery,
6051320	6059560	religion gods of the ancient world. And it's hermaphrodite. So it's, no, no, as it hermes,
6059560	6067080	I'm sorry, is it hermes and aphrodite, not, not Bacchus. Yeah. Hermes and aphrodite created God
6067880	6076600	named hermaphrodite. Hermaphroditis. Hermaphroditis. Okay, thank you. And this is, this was a very
6076680	6082920	important deity in the ancient world of the mystery religions, because you're bringing together these,
6083800	6092760	these, you have the angelos. The word angel comes from angelos, messenger. Hermes was the logos.
6093320	6100200	He was the word of Zeus, the messenger. He was an angel. He was the angelos. And he
6101160	6108760	creates with aphrodite, who's Venus, the Luciferia, the Lightbringer, this goddess, Hermaphroditas.
6109720	6115480	So you have this important genealogies happening in the Greek, in the, because there's a deeper
6115480	6122040	meaning behind this stuff. Like for example, Thanes, this is going to get crazy right now.
6122040	6129800	You're about to say it's about to get crazy. Thanes is the, is the, the primordial being
6130600	6136920	that comes from chaos. He's the beginning. He's the, he's the, the highest God there is.
6137800	6144520	And then from Thanes, you get Eros and Nix. What is this? What is this? Come on, don't just jump out
6144520	6150600	like that. Tell us, what did Zeus do to Thanes? What did he do to him?
6152840	6156680	It's an orphic, in the orphic fragments. Remember that you were looking at?
6156680	6162920	Yeah. He, he, he blows them. Yes. Yeah. I was, I was getting there. I was getting there.
6162920	6168520	I was going to get, oh, I'm sorry. No, no, no. That's what I'm saying. Thanes. So there's,
6168600	6175720	there's weird, there is this secret mystery religion language about Thanes where they'll say
6175720	6181960	Thanes is Bacchus or Bacchus is Thanes. And then they'll say, this is in the Durveni
6181960	6190280	Papyrus, by the way, that Zeus was there from the beginning. Okay. That's weird. He's the,
6190280	6195400	he's the beginning and the end, the Alphan Omega. Oh, that's weird. Then it says that Thanes is
6195400	6201160	Priapus. So like, normal, any normal person's scratching their head going, what's going on here?
6201160	6205640	Why is, why are all these gods the same person? Why are they all mixed together? Well, it's because
6206680	6213800	that original light that came out of chaos, which is Thanes, when, when Thanes gives birth to
6213800	6220840	the next generation and it goes down to Saturn or to our nose, who is the heaven god, then to Saturn,
6220840	6228120	then to Zeus, then to Bacchus. And then Bacchus has a child with Venus, who's Priapus. They all
6228120	6233960	had that spark of Thanes within them. So when Zeus is the beginning and the end, they're talking
6233960	6240040	about Thanes. When, when, when Priapus is being called Thanes, when Bacchus is being called the
6240040	6245080	divine child, the savior, the king of all the universe. And you're like, wait a minute, I thought
6245080	6249400	that was the title for Saturn. That's because they're all had the spark of Thanes in them.
6251560	6253880	And that's deep right there. That's what that means.
6254760	6261960	It's Jehovah. I'm so hot now, Neil. I'm so hot. You just brought up Jehovah. And it's just, it's
6261960	6267960	like, oh, let's look at him and see, and see him for what he is. You know what I mean? He's sucking
6267960	6276280	the Edoian, right? That Zeus goes in and sucks that Edoian, right? It doesn't, it, you know,
6276280	6284840	don't let it surprise you. All these tyrant gods are subservient to the, the, the, the Thanes, the,
6284840	6291080	the primordial chaos, the light and the darkness, the lightbringer, the Lucifer. They're all
6291080	6297240	subservient to that. They're always bound to fail. People don't realize the poles are flipped,
6297960	6306200	right? And the good guy who brings you reason and doesn't lie to you is the one that years
6306280	6314280	saying is the devil, right? When it's your Jehovah who is destined to fall.
6314920	6321640	And this goes back to this, even the Sumerians told that Anki, Anki's the one, Anki's the one who
6321640	6329480	tells Arthahassis that Anu is going to wipe all you out. You better build an ark. This is the
6329560	6337000	story you get with Dukallion. Instead of Anki, it's Prometheus. Prometheus is the savior. He
6337000	6341400	tells the humans how to survive because Zeus is a tyrant who's going to kill you all. It
6341400	6345480	doesn't like you, but Zeus doesn't want any humans to live. He's going to kill everybody.
6345480	6350360	Build a boat, take your wife with you and you can, and I'll tell you how to survive.
6350360	6356200	I'll tell you how to eat from the tree of knowledge and become like a god. That's the side. That's
6356200	6364920	the good side. That was the father of the civil. Yeah, who did that. And Pulascus was her brother.
6366120	6372360	Ew, we're going back prehistory. It's in the genealogy. No, but this is what's so brilliant
6372360	6379240	about the Greeks is that in these myths, they're writing, they're giving us like,
6379240	6383720	not only scientific treatises about like Big Bang and like, I'm not saying Big Bang,
6383720	6389400	but like there's like these little scientific treatises injected in the text, but they're also
6389400	6397160	telling history that the, the Pulascians, the, the, um, in the genealogy of these gods is this
6398440	6404680	genealogy of historical tribes that existed in the Mediterranean world and they're, and they're
6404680	6410040	preserving it in the myths. Brilliant. It's brilliant stuff. It really is. You got to,
6410040	6416760	you got to hand it to the Greeks. Brilliant. They really were just amazing at preserving history
6417480	6421560	in the myths. Now historians and scholars can look at these myths and say,
6421560	6425960	oh shoot, they're telling the story about the Pulascians coming out of the Black Sea region after
6425960	6430440	a flood and, and populating the world. That's what they're doing. They're telling that story.
6430440	6438040	That's why whenever I read ancient texts, I focus on the material evidence. Just show me the dildos,
6438680	6447400	show me the drugs, show me the purple anuses, you know what I mean? Show me the, yeah, no, show me
6447400	6455800	the, it's all in the text, you know, kids cutting their testicles off and throwing them into the
6456520	6460680	home where they have to get all the clothing from because they're going to be dressed like
6461320	6467000	girls from now on. That's in the right. That's the mystery religion of the Phrygians.
6467000	6474040	To look at their identity, I guarantee you. On March 25th, every year, they would initiate
6474040	6480840	new eunuch priests to take care of the temple of Kaiboli and they had, they had to mimic what Addis
6480840	6486440	did and castrate themselves and then throw their testicles into the house. That's whoever,
6486440	6490920	whoever caught that testicle had to go, they, there was their duty to bring the clothing out,
6490920	6498200	right? Tell them. Let's run this by. I'm a eunuch priest. I just castrate myself. I throw my
6498200	6504920	testicles into your house. Now, what does that mean to you? It means I got to make sure that you
6504920	6512200	look nice. I've got to provide you with some good clothing. It is, it's my religious duty
6512760	6517640	to do it. I don't care if you've got any daughters or not, right? This is a something,
6517720	6526840	it's a religious duty. It's a sacred thing. And by the way, Lucian says some people who came just
6526840	6533480	to watch this because, you know, like you said, it's a, you know, it's a holy event. It's a festival,
6533480	6543560	right? Some people who come to watch get caught up in the process and end up out there naked in
6543560	6553960	front of the population cutting their testicles off. Wow. And this is, this is because they really
6553960	6560040	believe in these rights. Yeah. They're practicing the sacred ancient, and these Phrygian rights
6560040	6565560	weren't new. They were going, and they said that the Phrygians got their rights from Samoth race.
6565560	6571080	Yeah. Yeah. Yassion, this is the story that, and even Clement talks about this in his
6571080	6579320	explanation of the Greeks. Yassion laid with Demeter in a fall night, right before fall came,
6579320	6583640	and then Zeus struck him down with lightning bolt. But they say before that happened, he brought the
6583640	6594680	rights to Phrygia. Yassion, right? Jason or Jesus, same name. And there's actually some text that
6594760	6601960	spell Yassios with an S at the end. It's a title. It's a title, right? It's a title within the
6601960	6607640	cult. It's a healer. Right. Yeah. And it comes from, you're exactly right to point out that
6607640	6614120	yaho root. People think that it's used in magic, by the way, just those Greek letters,
6615080	6625720	iota, alpha, omega, is part of a magic ritual. It is the saying of the I am that I am, right?
6625720	6631880	And it's a healing. They, Paion, they, is one of the shots that they have with it in the rights.
6632440	6637000	So you can see these things. I mean, they're in the text. I'm telling you, you take those gospels
6637000	6642360	and cut out all the sections that have to do with Jesus performing mystery
6643080	6651400	as a magus and getting down on a young kid who's acting as the bridge, by the way, Neil,
6651400	6657400	the bridge, by the way, with the kid or the drugs, right? That kid is there administering
6657960	6666600	that drug to Jesus. That kid is the Ganymede, the cup, right? That kid is the cup. And Jesus
6666680	6673160	is taking that cup and it poisons his ass. And he ends up not getting the antidote and screaming
6673160	6679560	on the cross and dying early. Neil, we know for a fact, all the evangelicals out there, please
6680920	6688360	support this. We know for a fact, Jesus did not die of crucifixion. He did not die of crucifixion.
6688360	6694920	Ask the next religious historian, say this crazy guy said, Jesus didn't die of crucifixion.
6695800	6700200	That's what the texts say, right? Because the Romans were like, fuck, they even noted it.
6700200	6705560	They're like, oh, he was dead early. He's hanging up there. You know, he shouldn't be dead yet.
6705560	6710680	Quick, right, right. Right? What's going on? Right? You know what's interesting about that.
6710680	6714680	I'm going to go ahead and finish that thought. Well, he's screaming. I just want you to realize
6714680	6720280	he's there screaming, right? And he's yelling out his stuff about being thirsty. He's yelling
6720280	6727720	out a phrase which strangely enough looks like it's been lifted the sabbathon directly from
6727720	6736360	the magical papyri that you're contemporary that Paul is saying, throw your magic books out, right?
6737080	6744040	Guess what? Jesus is using one. Yeah, right. Look, look, look, you just nailed on what I was
6744040	6750360	about to say. So that sabbathon thing, right? Everyone's pointed out that it's in Psalm 22.
6750360	6757480	Okay. They chose that Psalm for a reason because it's pointing to the sabbathon.
6760200	6765080	My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? But the Greek, if you look at the Septuagint version,
6765080	6770120	there's something happening there with the sabbathon. But listen to this, though.
6771080	6775880	Put that aside for a second. You got the sabbathon on the cross. He's yelling out,
6775880	6781000	my God, why are you forsaking me? Psalm 22. But the other three Gospels, he's also,
6782520	6788360	all three of them have a different Psalm. So when one of them, it's this, my God, the other one,
6788360	6796440	it's LOI. Like all three, all four of the Gospels are from a different Psalm. Psalms are songs that
6796520	6803480	you sing. They're hymns. Orpheus, when Orpheus is killed by the Maynids, what is he doing?
6804360	6815960	He's singing hymns. Both Jesus and Orpheus die singing chants in hymns. It's Orpic. I'm telling
6815960	6822280	you it's Orpic. That's what it is. It's Orpic. Why is that? Is it just me or was Orpheus in his,
6823160	6831960	before he was torn apart by the crowd of his own followers? He was saying something about naked
6831960	6840760	boys, wasn't he? He didn't sweat at all. So this is Orpheus' metamorphosis. Actually, I think I had
6840760	6846120	a text right here somewhere. We can just catch people up. We can just catch people up. All right,
6846120	6855640	look at this up. Orpheus' metamorphosis, the last story about Orpheus, after the Eurydus story,
6855640	6864040	it says that Orpheus was so depressed about Eurydus that he decided to take up the thration rights
6864840	6872120	of plucking little boys' manhoods before they come of age, and that women were throwing themselves
6872120	6877800	at Orpheus and he was denying them because he was into this stuff now. I'm not just making this up.
6877800	6884200	This isn't the text. He's plucking his nectar, people. He's plucking his nectar and he's bringing
6884200	6892440	that kid. Galen has the descriptions of the pre-puberty boy, excreta, and the post-puberty.
6892440	6900440	He's getting that serious fluid. Why? Because we're cutting him and we're wrapping him with
6900440	6907480	wraps so that he can have venom concoctions administered directly. I mean, this is a great
6907480	6915080	way to fly, brah. Yeah, eunuchs. You thought all the eunuchs were made by carving. There's also
6915080	6922840	chemical ways, right? There's chemical ways for that transformation to find that feminine, to take
6922840	6930440	that masculine, and to bring out snappy. There's ways to do that, and they're involved in these
6930440	6938760	ways. This should make you, evangelicals, very scared at the same time, very upset that your own
6938760	6947640	dude was involved in this kind of activity. You're holding up signs that say, hey, save the children.
6948200	6958120	Guess what? Your guy at Putin is abducting them, and your guy, Jesus, was thick in it. Thick in it.
6958840	6967720	Yeah, welcome. Welcome to your Christian mystery. Yeah. I was pulling up the text before they say
6967720	6972920	that I'm a liar, that I'm crazy. You have to see it for yourself. It's book 11, I believe,
6973000	6978040	by the depth of Orpheus. So while the songs, let me see. Let me see if I can share my screen.
6980440	6985080	Let me see. Damn. Yeah, I'll share my screen right now.
6986040	6991560	Just read it to us, Neil. Just read it. I'm trying to find it, actually. It's somewhere in,
6991560	6998440	it's somewhere right before he dies. I know that. Let's see. Bacchus and Midas. Bacchus.
6999400	7004360	Here we go. I'll talk while you're looking. Oh, did you find it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look for it.
7004360	7011160	All right. Talk while I'm looking for it. So he's looking for this myth. It's basically the myth
7011160	7019080	that Orpheus was killed by his own menads, right? And that he was killed for that reason because he
7019080	7029640	swore off. He swore off the right. He stopped the mystery and declared that he would only worship
7030680	7040120	the sun. Yeah, Apollo, right? Yeah. So they cut his head off and threw it in the river and
7041240	7046760	he, you know, people will take credit for where that ended up and whatnot. I'll get it ready for
7046760	7050680	the next time we do all live because I don't, I gotta go to the bathroom anyway. We've been going
7050680	7057480	live for two hours and I'm sure you got stuff to do anyway. But yeah, listen. Look it up.
7057480	7064680	Orpheus is metamorphosis. The last thing he does before he gets killed is he takes on the
7064680	7070120	Thracian rites. This is what it says. This is not my words. This is Orpheus words. Takes on the
7070120	7077160	Thracian rites of plucking little boys' manhoods before they come of age. And he says that they're
7077160	7081240	women were throwing themselves at him and he was denying them. That's what it says.
7081240	7088840	Just saying what it says. But that's Orpheus. We just went full back circle at the beginning of
7088840	7095480	this text. What's happening in Mark 14? Something Orpheus happening. That's what it is. Something
7095480	7100600	mysterious. Something. Oh, sorry. You, I missed your super chat. Have you made a video on the
7100600	7105160	exiting Soul Trap? Have you spoken with Howdy Missak? I will look into that. That's a good
7105160	7111320	question. Thank you for the super chat. But yeah, back to full circle again. What is happening
7111320	7119000	in Mark 14? It's the mystery. That's what's happening. Last final thoughts on this.
7119000	7130520	My final thoughts, if I can have any, are that we need to just accept the evidence.
7130520	7137720	We don't need any ideas. We don't need any theories. We just need to look at the texts that are there
7137720	7143560	and to determine, okay, what are they using? How are they using it? It's just good detective work.
7144280	7151240	And in doing so, we can free people from the narrative that they've already been fed.
7151960	7158200	And that is causing this great, I mean, this is our duty, man. If Tom Jefferson were here,
7158200	7166600	he was a classicist. He'd be like, you people, you know, oh, Neil, Neil, when are they going to
7166600	7173880	listen? When are they going to listen? It's, oh, you know, um, yeah, that's all I can say. Hey,
7173880	7178840	have you heard from Anastasia at all? Do you have any updates? Everybody's
7178840	7186040	She's, uh, she was talking about how one of her friends who was a, who was a male stripper.
7187720	7192840	And I, it reminds me of what you said about Hercules. Hercules putting on the, you know,
7192920	7199320	putting on the costume of the garb of the women and, uh, then going to war because this male
7199320	7205000	stripper is dressed up ready to fight the Russians. She was posing pictures with them. I was like,
7205000	7210680	that's all the Ukrainians. I love the Ukrainians so much. They're the heroes of today. They're,
7210680	7214760	that's those are the Bacchic warriors right now. That's Hercules and Bacchus over there.
7215480	7221720	What is it, Neil? Do you think it's the tension? Like at a specific place and time, you know,
7221720	7227480	that you'll have this force attracted and you can really concentrate. I mean, the place where they
7227480	7237720	hung the fleece was sacred to Mars. So it's a, it's a war environment. Is it that war environment
7237720	7246200	that suddenly brings that virgin, you know, that somebody can be the receptacle then? I mean,
7246200	7252760	I don't mean to be creepy or culty or anything, but if you think about it, the people then who are
7252760	7261400	in that environment like Anastasia, it, she be, can become the receptacle for real freedom for
7261400	7268920	that actual spirit of Athena. Am I crazy or? No, that's what it is. That's that. I think of the
7269560	7276120	democracy versus whatever Russia, I mean, I guess it's like an oligarchy, right?
7276920	7283080	That's that Republican oligarchy, you know, where the, the billionaires are deciding the
7283080	7290360	fate of the people. Whereas the Ukraine has that like that, that symbol of lady liberty
7290360	7297400	holding up the, the, the, the scale in her hands and the sword in the other hand. And that's Ukraine
7297400	7304040	right now. That's Ukraine right now. Ukraine is embodying that spirit right now. That's the lady
7304600	7311240	with the scale and one hand and the sword on the other hand. Ukraine, that's who you are right now.
7312520	7319800	That's how I see it. She's the virgin male. I mean, if we're going to find Athena somewhere,
7320520	7327640	there ever be somewhere, you know what I mean? Oh, I can't, I can't wait. This is fantastic.
7327640	7333800	You know, it's, it's terrible to, it's terrible to see something beautiful and something that's so
7333800	7341160	dark. But I mean, that's what dawn is, right? That's what that's what the dawn bringers do.
7342120	7347640	Right. This is, I wish we could speak about all the cult. We didn't even get to the,
7348280	7355480	the, the, the panto clator and the connection to Mithras. Did you know here, I'll leave with,
7355480	7360600	I'll leave with this. Go ahead. Take your time. Take your time. I'll just tease. There's a direct
7360600	7370600	linguistic connection between Jesus Christ and Mithras. He is the unconquered son. Yeah, it's
7370600	7375080	gorgeous. Yeah, I'll show you the, it's the Bible, man. Nobody ever reads it. I don't know why.
7375960	7383960	Yeah. Oh, I also have the link for your YouTube in the description. I'm showing it right now.
7383960	7389880	Subscribe to Lady Babylon and what, what twice a week you're going live and you're doing deep
7389880	7395880	dives like you just heard today. So the, if you like what you heard today, Amon does this twice
7395880	7401160	a week. He's doing this and he's touching on different subjects in the ancient Greek world
7401160	7406280	that nobody's talking about. You'll not get this anywhere else, except for Lady. I'm, I'm not
7406280	7412520	kidding. I watch every time you're live. I'm watching every time. So I thank you for the
7412520	7419880	opportunity, Neil, to be able to speak. And you know, I want people to know Neil told me last
7419880	7427720	week, he was like, you realize we're at war. And I was like, Oh, this guy's crazy. What's he doing?
7428680	7435640	You know, I was like, what? And I got to thinking about it over a couple of days, right? And
7436760	7446840	he understood. He had a focus and he understood exactly what one of those watchers, one of those
7446840	7453240	watchers would give you in Sodom, the exact same thing. Those are the lightning bringers,
7453240	7459240	right? Those bring the fire from all on us. This is heavenly kingdom stuff, people. You don't
7459240	7465800	realize what's there. It's the apocalypse. Neil, you promised me we bring the apocalypse or we
7465800	7473960	don't do it. We are, we this is, this is exactly what that is. Neil and I are two witnesses for you.
7474840	7486840	Yeah. And we are witnessing to Jesus Christ, the selling pirate child rapist. Jesus Christ,
7486840	7494520	the kid selling child rapist. Druggy, he's on drugs, a lot of drugs, Jesus and drugs.
7494840	7508520	Yeah. That's what it is. Oh, shoot, I found it. Orpheus. Such was the grave,
7508520	7513240	grove of Orpheus drawn together. He surrounded the seven of my animals. He tried the cords and
7513240	7519880	was convinced on the notes, raised the voice, oh muse, was this it? But now, but now for the
7519880	7525640	gentler, I would sing for boys, the favorites of the gods, and even of maids, pay the penalties
7525640	7531160	for the wrong. Is that it? No, that's something else. Huh. All right, I'll find it next time.
7532360	7536600	It's somewhere in Orpheus, or something, somewhere in Ovid. I'll find it for next time.
7536600	7539800	And by the way, Neil, no, by the way, you know, it's really cool of it.
7539800	7542520	Oh, I found it. I found my Ovid. Okay. Okay, I can hide it now.
7542520	7544440	It's very cool. I'll, I'll.
7544440	7548280	So glad we held out this long. I found it right now. I have it saved right here.
7548520	7554200	Okay. It's so glad. It's so good that you're doing this with Ovid, that you're resurrecting Ovid.
7555000	7562200	Doesn't he get imprisoned in the most hostile place, the civilization at the time?
7563400	7567320	And it was for Julia, wasn't it? It was maybe for...
7567880	7572520	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ovid. Yeah. Okay. Can you, can you read this for me?
7573400	7573900	Yeah.
7577000	7580520	Picks. Oh, the top part, the top part. This is from...
7581080	7587000	Yeah, with the love of women, with the love of women, perhaps because of his fortune and love,
7587000	7594840	or he may have plighted his troth forever, but scores of women were burning to sleep with the
7594840	7601000	bard and suffered the pain of rejection. Oh, yeah, that's right. You, yeah.
7601000	7604760	Women are throwing themselves at him and he's rejecting them. That's what that means.
7604760	7610280	Yeah. You, Elvis, Elvis is not available right before Orpheus gets killed, but keep going.
7610280	7616840	Orpheus even started the practice among the Thracian tribes of turning for love to immature males
7617400	7624680	in a plucking the flower of a boy's brief spring before he has come to his manhood.
7624680	7630120	Welcome to salvation, brothers and sisters. Welcome to salvation.
7630120	7631880	Welcome to the mysteries. Yeah.
7633640	7638200	So the answer, the answer to the question that we've been, the answer to the question of this,
7638200	7642600	of this stream, what is happening in Mark 14? Yeah. Yeah.
7642600	7650280	Mysteries. Yeah. Brilliant. Neil, that was the best thing ever produced. Yeah, I can't,
7650280	7655560	it's done. It's done. Thank you. You have just attained true gnosis.
7664200	7666280	You have just attained true gnosis.
7669160	7675400	The demiurge has no power over you.
