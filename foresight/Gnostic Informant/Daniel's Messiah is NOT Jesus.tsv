0	5280	There are two anointed ones spoken here in these passages at the end of Daniel's mind.
5280	12080	There's one anointed one who comes after seven weeks, which means after 49 years, namely that
12080	19120	Cyrus. How do you know? Because Tove says it. Forget Tovia. Look at Isaiah 45 verse 1. Cyrus is God's
19120	27840	Messiah, God's Messiah. It says it explicitly. But only here in Daniel's mind do they translate
27840	36560	the word Messiah has Messiah and it goes further. They then capitalize the word Messiah. Open up
36560	42160	your King James right now. Open up your new American standard right now. Open up your new
42160	52640	NIV right now. Messiah is capitalized. Now here is the here is the ultimate brain just the brain
53440	58240	and that is there is no such thing as a capital letter in the Hebrew language.
58800	67440	In Isaiah 45 verse 1, do you think that the word anointed is capitalized or not capitalized?
68880	75760	Until an anointed one, a prince, the Messiah, the Prince of the King James translate,
75920	83280	be seven weeks. Stop. There's a semicolon there. Here's what I want you to do. I want you to open
83280	91520	up a modern King James. That means not the 1611. Let's go to the one that was just published
91520	101280	yesterday. Okay. And notice. Wow. Thanks. So what happened? This is mind blowing. I mean your front
101280	110800	alone should be shooting through your cerebellum and I don't even know what I just said.
110800	134880	Welcome back to the Gnostic Informant and you are about to attain true gnosis. And I'm with Rabbi
134880	140400	Tobias Singer now, back by popular demand as always. You know, after a couple of weeks, people
140400	144160	started people started asking in the comment section, where's the rabbi? Where's where's he been?
144880	153360	I know. So you know, I gotta I do I do what I'm told you don't know. But anyway, anyways, I want to
153360	161440	talk to you about Daniel and this. So like I said before, last time you were on, right, I get
161520	165040	these emails from people and they watch my they watch us they watch you and they're listening
165040	168800	intently and they want to learn. Like, oh, you guys are making good points. These are
168800	174480	unfalsifiable points are making. We can look these up. We could check the Hebrew. And sure enough,
174480	179680	you guys are right. But and I always get these, you always get these butts. And then there's a
179680	184240	couple more questions at a tackle done. It's like, Okay, Isaiah 53. Okay, you're right. It's the
184240	188160	suffering servants Israel. We got it. You guys, you guys are right. All right. And then say like,
188160	192560	okay, the the the virgin thing you guys are right about that. Okay, whatever, you're right,
192560	198800	you know, Alma, but you got that. But now I got you. I got you in check now. I'm like, Okay,
198800	207520	what is it now? Daniel, Daniel nine. Who else could Daniel be talking about when he talks about
207520	214000	the 70 weeks, the anointed one will be cut down. Right. It's so clear that that's Jesus.
214960	218560	So I'm going to throw it right over to you. You can take as much time as you need. Explain
218560	224160	to us what this means. And how how does it get so misinterpreted?
225280	231840	It should be said from the outset that if someone concedes Isaiah 53, which they would have to,
231840	238160	as you said, the context that demands it, and concedes Isaiah chapter seven is not talking
238240	245600	about the birth of a Messiah 700 years later, you then control the New Testament in the place
245600	253040	that it belongs the garbage, because that demonstrates that Matthew was misappropriating
253040	260000	passages from the Hebrew Bible, and both Isaiah seven and Isaiah 53 are used in the New Testament.
260000	267360	Philip famously used that with the with the eunuch from Gaza and Matthew 123. But Daniel nine,
267360	274080	you're right, stands out alone. Very, very unique because Christians will say Daniel nine is very
274080	282640	different here because here we have a precise prediction of exactly when the Messiah is going
282640	289840	to be killed going to be crucified. We have the timing. It is perfectly set up and is outlined
289840	297520	in the last four passages of the ninth chapter of Daniel. How could you deny Christ? Now it was
297520	304240	very striking about this. I brought up the Isaiah 53 and Isaiah seven, not just because you did,
305280	310560	but there's something very striking about Daniel nine. And that is the writers of the New Testament
310560	316720	did not consider that to be very important. In fact, nowhere in the Christian Bible did the
316720	324400	authors think or record that Daniel nine predicts the date of the Messiah's death. I mean, you would
324400	331120	have to believe that Paul knew that Daniel nine predicted that the Messiah would be cut off,
331120	338160	killed after 70 weeks. And Paul just didn't think that was important enough to mention,
338160	343440	you'd have to believe that the writers of all four Gospels and the letters of Peter and John,
343440	347200	no one thought it was important enough. So it's mentioned nowhere. And in a moment,
347200	354320	you're going to understand why there's probably no text in the Hebrew scriptures that has been
354320	362720	mangled more extensively than the ninth chapter of Daniel. And we're going to talk about what's
362720	376560	going on there. Daniel is using a is using a unit of time that you, the viewer need to know before
376560	385200	we can get started. And that is, he's using terms of days and weeks to represent years. So a week
385200	397280	in Daniel nine is meant to represent seven years. So 70 weeks is 490 years. And what the church
397280	404720	had to do was to alter the last four passages of Daniel nine, in order to make it look like
404720	411280	the Messiah is going to come and he's going to be cut off. And he's going to be killed
411840	417040	before the destruction of the second temple. This is exactly how it's going to be presented to you.
417680	426160	But in order to accomplish this feat, they had to change the text. Now, one point your
426160	434560	viewers must understand if you don't get this, you're going to be lost. The word Messiah anointed
435360	446400	Messiah is mentioned 39 times in the Hebrew Bible. 39 times is that word appear. As it turns out,
446400	454080	it is never referring to the Messiah, who we refer to as the Messiah, never. It refers to that's
454080	459280	right. So this is like a huge surprise. If you don't get this, you're not going to get anything.
460080	466160	The word appears in the book of Leviticus more frequently than any other. And there is referring
466160	474880	to priests, Kohanim, Ahmad the Senate of Aaron. So I people from my tribe from my family line are
474880	484800	called anointed. Now, in every other instance in the Hebrew Bible, with the word Messiah appears,
485520	491440	the Christian Bibles, the King James, the new international version, all of them line up all
491440	504960	the usual characters correctly translate the word Messiah as anointed. But only here in Daniel 9
504960	513120	do they translate the word Messiah as Messiah, and it goes further. They then capitalize the
513200	519440	word Messiah. Open up your King James right now. Open up your new American standard right now. Open
519440	529120	up your new NIV right now. Messiah is capitalized. Now here is the here is the ultimate brain,
529680	535840	just the brain screw. And that is, there is no such thing as a capital letter in the Hebrew
535840	539600	language. I found that out the hard way. I found that out the hard way. When I started looking
539600	545440	into Hebrew, I said, wait, wait, wait, where's the where's the capital? There's no capitalized
545440	551360	no way. And then I was like, okay, that changes a lot of things. You know, people wonder why I care
551360	556800	about Christians so much. And why don't I get angry when I interact with Christians? The reason I
556800	561360	don't is I feel so sorry for them. My heart goes out to them. And if I was in their predicament,
561360	567120	that means I've read no Hebrew, I didn't say no word to Hebrew, even though Christians firmly
567120	572080	believe that the Bible, the Hebrew scriptures was originally written in Hebrew slash is a
572080	577360	little Aramaic. But it's it's the even they believe that the Hebrew is the word of God,
577360	582400	but they can't read a word of it. And they are utterly dependent on the translators,
582400	587440	so much so. And you know, this right Christians argue over which is the right translation. There's
587440	592400	some Christians that believe that only the King James like what I mean, if it was good enough
592400	598240	for Peter, it was good enough. We know all the silliness. But this is why Christians could
598240	606320	are so easily victimized here is because they're reading Daniel nine, and it says Messiah,
606320	615760	capital on M, and it gets worse. The word the Hebrew is Messiah, what the King James does,
615760	622400	they amp it up, and they put in the definite article, the Messiah. There is no definite
622400	626960	article in the Hebrew. So therefore, when you're reading a Christian Bible, you're reading a
626960	633440	commentary, you're reading a human iteration. And this is not just any translate, any translation
633440	639040	is a human commentary. But in the case of the Christian Bibles, and the fundamentals Christian
639040	645280	Bibles, you're reading a corruption. And I just for a moment, just so you know, I want to tip my
645280	651680	hat to the normal Christians, the mainline Christians, the revised standard version,
651680	659360	or the new revised standard version does not engage in this idiotic process. They they're
659360	664080	straight ahead on this. And by the way, the King James only people who was the tribe I came from,
664720	669600	they thought these were demonic Bibles, because they were correct. They think that
669600	673760	Satan corrupted these Bibles. And I used to I used to go along with this. This is what the
673760	678400	pastor would tell me. Oh, Paul, watch your NIV. Look, it says in anointed, and it's not even in
678400	684160	capital. It's the anointed, look at your King James. See, they changed it. And then I did the
684160	688480	courageous thing, the thing that you're not supposed to do. So I went online and looked up the Hebrew,
688480	692720	looked up the the manuscripts, looked up the Septuagint, and let's try to check them all up.
692720	698240	So I had to compare them all, found out that there is no the there's no capital M. It's
698240	703200	in anointed. It's somebody who's somebody who's anointed as a priest.
705520	711040	This is going to gloom very large here. And you know, I'm going to say this to you, I can't think
711040	717440	of another theological conversation. Well, what we're about, what I'm about to share with you is
717440	725440	going to come up. So it actually when people say they only follow the King James, the King James
725440	732720	only people. So most people see that as completely insane. The King James was commissioned this
732720	741760	translation 1607. 47 people ultimately completed in 1611. And people really think today that when
741760	748400	they're reading a King James Bible, that they're reading the 1611. If you had a 1611, which you
748560	756800	can buy online. There is a 400 changes done from 1611 to like 1807 or something like that.
756800	762080	Right. And then there's another massive and that's because the language changes. Right.
762080	770080	Grammar. I mean, when in 1607, the the English is called the Jacobean English, you can make it out.
770080	776000	But it's it's Jacobean English. It's not sure, sir. It's readable. But it's definitely not our
776000	781200	King James. So the King James has gone through numerous revisions, because grammar is updated,
781200	788400	words are updated, the colon semicolon just came into fashion. I mean, think of it this way,
789120	795120	the King James version was published just a dozen years after Shakespeare published The
795120	800880	Merchant of Endless. Okay, this is really going back in time. So it's been so like which King
800880	806880	James are you referring to? Now you might think you the viewer might think that I'm just sort of
806880	812560	sort of poking something at people who are King James only, I wouldn't waste my time with this,
812560	819040	but this is going to become humongous in just a moment. So what Christians are saying is that look,
819920	828480	there are 70 weeks that are decreed upon the people and the holy city, and then six things
828480	833920	to terminate transgression and sin to wipe away iniquity, to bring everlasting righteous and
833920	841680	to seal the vision of profit, and to anoint the most holy six things. Okay, and no one comprehend
841680	847760	now in a King James Bible, it'll it'll read that from the going forth the commandment to restore
847760	855440	and to build Jerusalem, until the Messiah, capital M, the Prince, capital P, it's insanity,
855920	862960	shall be seven weeks, and three scorned two weeks, which means 62 weeks, how much seven,
862960	869680	60 and two, 69 weeks. And therefore, and what will happen then, the streets will be rebuilt,
869680	877760	straight and mowed, but in fabulous times, verse 26, after the 62 weeks shall Messiah,
877760	883360	the Messiah be cut off, but not for himself. Okay, so they're saying here we have a clear
883360	893360	prediction of Christ crucified when Paul preached. Now let's go back. And I think the key question
895120	901760	to ask a Christian, I've done this in many live debates that on YouTube where I've asked the
901760	909680	Christian like, what is your calculation? When do you start counting these 490 years?
909760	916880	Like, and Christians just have no idea. That's the key. I've stood in huge audiences,
917600	923520	all over the world. And when Christians ask me about Daniel nine, I've always asked the simple
923520	932640	question, if there's a 490 year period, or a 483 period, a year period, because there's 69 weeks,
932640	940560	at when do you start counting? And why do you start counting them? And Christians just completely
940560	945920	shut down. They have no idea. They're not bad people. They're just never taught this. The pastors
945920	953760	are not evil. Their pastors have no clue. So what we're going to do is we're going to actually unpack
953760	959280	what's happening here. Because there's one other thing that Christians don't know. We've gone
959360	964560	through this before. When we've talked about Isaiah 714, ask a Christian, what does it say
964560	971280	in Isaiah 713? What is the context? When you read Isaiah 53, what does it say in Isaiah 52?
971280	978400	And Christians just go, the lights go out. So what is happening here in Daniel nine?
978400	987440	Daniel is an extraordinary predicament. Here's a prophet that is standing. This is how Daniel
987440	996560	nine begins in the first year of Darius the meat. Why is that significant? If you don't know why
996560	1007760	that's meaningful, you can pack up and go home. What does that mean? Why is there is a prayer?
1007760	1014640	Daniel is crying to God. He feels like the Jewish people are in an enormous amount of trouble. And
1014640	1024240	you have no idea how serious the problem that Daniel's confronting Daniel. And I'm just unpacking
1024240	1032240	Daniel chapter nine verse one and two. Daniel is standing at a time when the Babylonian empire
1032240	1039760	has just collapsed. Historians to this day are hard pressed to explain how this could have happened.
1039760	1046080	We talk about Babylonian Empire. You think about the United States. This was a massive empire.
1046080	1053600	Like how did it collapse? And the Persian Empire suddenly explodes into a massive empire. How did
1053600	1062240	it happen to this day? Historians are hard pressed to explain how it could have happened. But Daniel
1062240	1067600	is looking at two passages in Jeremiah. If you don't know this,
1069600	1076240	you can possibly understand Daniel nine. The first passage is Jeremiah chapter 25 verse 12.
1076960	1086080	It's a passage that looks very similar to Daniel chapter 29 verse 10. Because both of them talk
1086080	1092960	about a redemption of the Jewish people full of Babylon and they seem to be predicting the same
1092960	1101760	exact thing. Daniel chapter 25 verse 12. Jeremiah is speaking and he's conveying that the Babylonian
1101760	1112160	empire will collapse after 70 years. The audience needs to understand this because if you don't
1112160	1119120	understand what's going on in this passage, Jeremiah is trying to convince the Jewish people
1119120	1126000	not to rebel against Babylon. That's a huge part of the book of Jeremiah. People are saying let's
1126000	1132800	fight against the Babylonians. And Jeremiah is saying God is not on your side. And if you do fight
1132800	1139120	against Babylon, God is not going to be with you. And in fact, they didn't listen to Jeremiah.
1139760	1147600	And moreover, Jeremiah says, the Babylonian empire only has 70 years. So if you just shut up
1147600	1153360	and wait it out, they're going to be gone. That's the message of Jeremiah 25 verse 12. And that's
1153360	1160560	the context. There is another passage which I'll read to you in the Jeremiah 29 verse 10. This is
1160560	1169440	what Daniel is struggling with in that opening passage of Daniel 9. In Jeremiah 29 10, it says,
1169440	1176640	the bus sayeth the Lord, at the completion of 70 years of Babylon, I will remember you. I will
1176640	1186000	fill my good word toward you to restore you to this place. It seems identical. So imagine
1186000	1194240	Daniel is standing there. The unthinkable, the Soviet Union, a massive empire collapses.
1194240	1201680	The Babylonian empire, your nemesis collapses. But nothing's happening. The Jews are not going
1201680	1207920	back. Darius, the meat has emerged. That means the Persian empire has begun. Right. And nothing is
1207920	1218080	the Jews are not going back. And Daniel is going, oh my Lord, this is ominous. Daniel begins to think,
1218080	1227600	and this is in the text in Daniel 9, begins to imagine that, whoa, the curse of Leviticus chapter
1227600	1234720	26 verse 18, which says, if you sin against me and continue sin, I'll multiply your punishment
1234720	1242080	seven times has emerged. And in fact, instead of a 70 year exile, there's perhaps a 490 year
1242080	1248400	exile. And that's what he's struggling with. The angel Gabriel comes to explain to Daniel what is
1248400	1256400	actually happening here. I need one other short history lesson. It's fascinating. I love it. Okay,
1256400	1263440	so I need you the viewer to listen like you've never listened in your life. This is a critical
1263520	1270320	history lesson. We're talking about Solomon's temple that stood for 410 years.
1271120	1278960	History lesson, you must understand or you can't approach this text. 19 years prior to the
1278960	1284800	destruction of the first temple, the Vuchad Netser and the Babylonian empire emerge.
1285200	1294480	Power, a massive empire emerge, changes everything. Okay, so that's 19 years prior to
1294480	1301200	destruction of the first temple. In the very next year, which is now 18 years before the
1301200	1306320	destruction of the first temple, the Vuchad Netser, who's called Nebuchadnezzar, I think in the
1307280	1316720	English-sized version, Nebuchadnezzar invades the land of Israel and he subjugates Jerusalem,
1316720	1323680	which means the land of Israel becomes a vassal state of the Babylonian empire. Very critical.
1324800	1332080	Nebuchadnezzar then will seek to extract. He doesn't want to destroy a temple at that point. He
1332080	1338800	doesn't want to do any of those things. He just wants the Jews to give taxes to him and be loyal to
1338800	1345120	him and give up on any idea of rebellion. These kings usually, they're not like Nazis. They just
1345120	1351920	wanted to kill. This is no genocide. He just wanted the Jews to say, for them to say, okay,
1351920	1357600	we surrender and we are now going to look like the Russians in Ukraine. Just surrender, say,
1357600	1364880	take it over and you're now under the Russian empire. It's the same exact idea. The Jews don't
1364880	1371360	want to listen to Nebuchadnezzar as any people, they would fight for their independence and Nebuchadnezzar
1371360	1378800	then begins waves of expulsion of Jews, multiple ways of expulsion of Jewish people. During these
1378800	1386320	18 years and the Jews continue to rebel, Jeremiah pleads with them, don't rebel, but bear this in
1386320	1394800	mind. From 18 years prior to destruction of the first temple, Jerusalem already is a vassal state
1394800	1403520	of the Babylonian empire. There is no independence any longer. Now listen carefully. In the 19th
1403520	1411360	year from the Babylonian empire, the first temple is totally destroyed and almost all the Jews are
1411360	1418160	exiled to Babylon. A small number goes to Egypt, but that's not germane right now. The first temple,
1418160	1425120	Solomon's temple, is utterly destroyed by the Babylonian empire. Here's one other key element,
1425120	1434560	a date you must know. For 50 years from the time the first temple was destroyed, until the Persian
1434560	1440000	empire emerges, which means Darius the Mead, a very brief interlude, but then Cyrus the Great
1440800	1448160	is 50 years, a 50-year period spans from the destruction of the first temple until
1449120	1454800	the emergence of the Persian empire with Cyrus, who God calls his Messiah. I'm giving you a wink,
1454800	1461440	I'm giving you a hint of what's going on there. Back in Isaiah 45 says that Cyrus, who was a king,
1461440	1469920	who was an anointed prince, literally in Isaiah 45, Cyrus gives the command for the Jews to return
1469920	1479120	back to Jerusalem and to rebuild it. Okay, so therefore, here's the key. If you're Daniel
1479920	1486320	and you're standing at when the Babylonian empire is classed, but the Jews have not returning
1486320	1495360	because Darius the Mead, you're counting 70 years from when? 70 years from the emergence of the
1495360	1502560	Babylonian empire, which means you just passed the 69th year, and you're going, okay, one part of
1502560	1509200	this prophecy has been fulfilled, but we're not going back. It's like you can hear crickets in
1509200	1517360	the background, like what's going on? Like part one of prophecy is fulfilled, a part two isn't
1517360	1525280	fulfilled. The angel Gabriel is there to explain to Daniel that in fact these two 70-year periods
1525280	1531840	of Jeremiah 25, verse 12, and 29, verse 10 are two different 70-year periods because
1531840	1537680	the Babylonian exile, that means for the time the first temple was destroyed until the second
1537680	1544800	temple was built under the leadership of Zubaval and Yushua, Ben-Yo, and so on, that's 70 years.
1544800	1551600	So therefore, there are two 70-year periods that overlap with each other and the overlap is 50 years,
1551600	1557440	and now we can understand what's happening. So Daniel was pouring out his guts and going,
1557440	1564400	please Lord, have mercy on us. Let us go back to our land. Let not this terrible curse come upon us
1564480	1572400	articulated in Leviticus chapter 26, verse 19. So the text actually reads, you should know and
1572400	1580400	understand, I'm going now to Daniel chapter 25, verse, chapter 9, verse 25, you should know and
1580400	1585040	understand from the going forth of the word. What does that mean from the going forth of the word?
1585040	1590720	We know that from Daniel chapter 9, verse 1 and 2, that means from the destruction of Jerusalem
1590720	1598880	to return and rebuild Jerusalem until an anointed prince, the Hebrew is ad-meshiach-nogid,
1599600	1606800	will be shavuim shiva, seven weeks. How long is seven weeks? Remember what I told you, each
1606800	1612960	day is a year. I'm not going to go into why there's a reason why each day is a year in this,
1612960	1618960	in Daniel 9, it's not the only place. It's very similar to Leviticus chapter 25. If you know what
1618960	1626240	that means, great. If not, I don't want to overload you with information. Seven weeks, which means 49
1626240	1634640	years will pass from the destruction of the first temple until an anointed prince, ad-meshiach-nogid.
1635600	1640880	Seven weeks, that's 49 years. Remember what I told you, from the destruction of the first
1640880	1647120	temple until Cyrus gives the command, see the opening passages of Ezra. This is why the
1647200	1652320	Christian Bibles take the book of Ezra and they shove it away from the end of it because they
1652320	1657200	don't want you to see it. That's why they mix up the order. They mix it up. Right, right, right.
1657200	1662720	In the Jewish Bible, after you finish Daniel, go to Ezra. That's a nightmare for the church because
1662720	1667600	if you finish Daniel, remember Daniel is only 12 chapters, and then you open up Ezra. What does
1667600	1674640	Ezra begin with? The book of Ezra begins not with Ezra. My friends, boys and girls, in the book of
1674640	1681840	Ezra, we're not introduced to Ezra until chapter seven. Ezra begins chapter one, verse one, two,
1681840	1688560	three, four, five, in a pronouncement of Cyrus the Great saying, Jews, I have a word from God.
1688560	1694800	You need to go back and rebuild Jerusalem. You've got to rebuild your temple, and I have it on word
1694800	1700880	from God. Why is Cyrus saying that? Because he has a 200-year-old prophecy from Isaiah. And he
1700880	1706480	says, I have it on God, that I've got to send you back. So therefore, what it says there is from the
1706480	1713600	going forth of the word, the word is the word of prophecy, of Lechervot Jerusalem, see Daniel nine,
1713600	1719920	verse one and two, from the destruction of the first temple until Cyrus the Great. Who is Cyrus
1719920	1724880	the Great? He is at anointing. He's not just anointed, but he's a prince. Now, how do you know I'm
1724880	1731440	telling you the truth? My friends, all you have to do is go to Isaiah chapter 44, verse 28,
1731440	1736720	and Isaiah 45, verse one. That's where the chapter break is. That chapter break is completely
1736720	1744640	artificial. Who says to Cyrus, Isaiah 44, verse 28, he is my shepherd, all my desire will be
1744640	1751680	fulfilled in him. To say to Jerusalem, it shall be built and the temple shall be founded. So says the
1751680	1761200	Lord, I want to say that again, and you can open up your King James Christy Bible with 15
1761200	1767120	crosses on it. It doesn't make a difference which one you use. It will say, to my anointed,
1767120	1776320	to Cyrus, the Hebrew is Messiah. And interestingly, my friends, take a guess before you look it up.
1776480	1787680	In Isaiah 45, the exact same Hebrew word, Messiah, the Messiah, to his anointed, do you think in a
1787680	1795920	King, based on what I've told you, in Isaiah 45, verse one, do you think that the word anointed
1795920	1805040	is capitalized or not capitalized? In the King James? In the anything, in Jesus Christ? Right,
1805120	1814560	in the Christ Jesus Christ, Mary, Mother of God. Yeah, which it shouldn't be. Which is it? It's the
1814560	1820320	same Hebrew word. Why are you doing, why are you messing with you? You're right. That's exactly
1820320	1826080	true. They're messing with the text. You Christians, I say this with love, you need to go back to
1826080	1833520	church and demand a refund. You need to pull your kid. You're being lied to. You mean, you need to
1833520	1841760	ask your pastor, why does the exact same Hebrew word, which appears in Isaiah 45, is translated as
1841760	1849440	anointed with no capital A? And why don't you translate as Messiah in Isaiah 45, verse one?
1849440	1855360	Listen, listen, listen. Yeah, please, please, please. If you doubt what I'm saying,
1856320	1864400	ask your pastor, ask any Christian apologists, why does the King James Bible? Why does the King
1864400	1873520	James translate the word Messiah in Isaiah 41, five, as anointed? But some, for some reason,
1874400	1881120	in Daniel nine, as Messiah, like, what are you doing? It's the same Hebrew word. Could you explain
1881120	1886960	that? Because if you can't explain it, I'm out. If you can't explain it, I put a lot of money in
1886960	1891520	that plate they pass around, and I'm out of here, and I'm leaving skid marks, and I'm pulling my
1891520	1895760	kids out of this Christian school. And I'm gonna start teaching my kids Hebrew. That is another
1895760	1902800	prime example of somebody taking the word batula and changing it into, or I'm sorry,
1902800	1908000	Alma and making that virgin, but then in other places in the text where the same word is used,
1908000	1913760	they don't use that. So they're doing the they're doing it again. They're finding somewhere in the
1913760	1919520	Bible in the Old Testament, where they need to emphasize certain words that have to be Christ
1919520	1924960	like, capital M Messiah, but the same words used earlier in the in a different book,
1925760	1931920	to describe the same person. Isaiah and Daniel talking about the same person. And it's capital,
1931920	1936880	it's lowercase a anointed. It's the same word. Messiah is anointed. That's the same word. It's
1936880	1943280	the Christ. In Greek, in Greek, it should say Christ, the Christian one. Right. I mean, although
1943280	1950800	we have, right, that means why are you deliberately translating the exact same word in one you're
1950800	1956640	rendering as them and you put the stuff the definite article there stuff a capital letter
1956640	1963840	there. Just please don't let let don't please don't let your pastor or priest or Christian
1963920	1969280	upon whoever it is. Don't let them like, change, don't let them change the topic. Okay, you got
1969280	1974720	to try. I need an answer. And if you don't get a satisfying answer, I think it's time for you
1974720	1981040	just to consider what's happening to you. This is why I care. Because I know if I grew up in a
1981040	1986640	Christian home, I don't know if I'd figure this thing out. I don't know. Because I wasn't, if I
1986640	1991200	was grew up in a Christian home in Oklahoma, I wouldn't be taught biblical Hebrew. If I was
1991200	1995680	brought up in a Christian home in Kansas, they don't teach Kansas a pretty conservative a lot
1995680	2001200	of evangelicals there. None of their schools for nine year olds are taught Hebrew. When I was nine
2001200	2006000	years old, I could read Hebrew like you read a newspaper. I mean, it's not I'm wasn't just
2006000	2012720	a spectacular student. I was very average. Any orthodox kid, they learned we learned Hebrew.
2012720	2016480	I mean, we're just reading it straight through. And it's really easy. It's a small language.
2017040	2023840	It gets crazier than this. First, what I'm going to do is I'm going to give you the final answer
2023840	2029680	first. And then we're going to back up. There are two anointed ones spoken here in these passages
2029680	2036080	at the end of Daniel nine. There's one anointed one who comes after seven weeks, which means after
2036080	2042720	49 years, namely that Cyrus, how do you know? Because Tove says it forget Tovia. Look at Isaiah
2042800	2049520	45 verse one, Cyrus is God's Messiah, God's Messiah. It says it explicitly. And then there's a
2049520	2056880	subsequent anointed one who was cut off. He's not called the prince anymore after 62 weeks. Now,
2056880	2062640	I'm going to give you the answer now. And then we can backpedal this. The distance from the
2062640	2068880	destruction of the first time or destruction of the second temple is 490 years, 70 year exile,
2068960	2077520	420 for the for the length of the second temple period. When do listen very carefully? When
2077520	2083040	does the priesthood get cut off and the temple gets shut down? Let me at the end of the second
2083040	2089440	temple period, when the Jews go to war with Rome, when does the war with Rome commence?
2090240	2099680	64, 66, 66, which is how long? It's a half a week from 66 to 70 is how long? It's three and a half
2099680	2108560	years, right bingo. There is your half a week. So what have this is mind blowing? I mean, your
2108560	2112640	frontal lobe should be shooting through your cerebellum. And I don't even know what I just said.
2113600	2119760	So in 66, what happens? The Jews go to war with Rome. It's a horrible, bloody war.
2120320	2125600	Temple is surrounded. I, I'm a priest. That means I'm a direct descendant of Aaron,
2125600	2132160	my father, father, father, going back today to see you understand this, although there are many
2132160	2138240	rules that govern my life that is distinct from other Jewish people. As an example,
2138240	2141840	I can't come into contact with a dead person. It's forbidden to think.
2143600	2150160	There are rules that apply to me. But I can't bring sacrifices. I can't work in the temple
2150160	2155520	because there is no temple. That means when the Jews go to war with Rome, the whole temple gets
2155520	2160960	shut down, everything becomes isolated. It becomes a no, instead of a no flies on it becomes a no
2160960	2166160	sacrifice zone. So then an anointed one is cut off. That's the priesthood. That means there are
2166160	2173760	130 commandments in a Torah at a 613 associated with sacrifices bingo. That's cut off. The word
2173760	2180960	he carries, Mashiach means an anointed one means carries doesn't mean killed. Now it could be if
2180960	2185760	someone's cut off or it could be removed. It could be the kill, but it doesn't mean there are many
2185760	2191840	ways you could say you're hurrying Mashiach. That's how you would say a Messiah is, is killed.
2192720	2198560	Car race is removed. The literally the the root of the word means removed. Now how to,
2198560	2206000	what does the Christian do with this? Because they want only one Messiah. And what they do,
2206000	2211040	this tiny complicated, my apologies to you beforehand, but you need to know these numbers,
2211040	2217680	or you'll never understand Daniel 9. Daniel 9 is describing two anointed ones, one that comes
2217680	2225120	after 549 years after seven weeks. And that's Cyrus and a second subsequent anointed one. But
2225120	2233760	he's not a prince. He's not Cyrus. He's coming. He's coming 62 weeks later, which is 434 years.
2233760	2240720	That's three and a half years before the destruction of the second temple. And he is removed. The
2240720	2246400	church hates this. They need to have both anointed ones are the same. And this is where it gets
2246400	2251680	interesting. So if you're looking at a Christian model, whatever, it's going to make it appear as
2251680	2260320	though the period of time is 760 and two. So the text is going to read the Messiah, the prince in
2260320	2266080	a King James shall be from going forth of the commandment to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem
2266080	2274800	until the Messiah, the prince shall be seven weeks comma and three score and two weeks,
2274800	2281840	which means 62 weeks. That means it sounds like the text is saying 69 weeks, but it's breaking
2281840	2287440	it up into a weird way. That means it puts a comma there, but there's no comma there. It should be a
2287440	2293200	complete semicolon there. This is where the King James of vision is going to is going to blow your
2293200	2302640	mind out the window. That means in any language, the way you say 69 is 69. It's not just English
2303120	2311520	in French 69 in German nine in Zerchse. You never say you never say seven, two and 16.
2311520	2316800	So what the church did was it compressed these two. It really is saying after 17 weeks, I'll
2316800	2324560	translate after 49 weeks, we have Cyrus. And if there is subsequent 434 years, you have an anointed
2324560	2330000	one, which is the priesthood cut off, but they have to conflate it. So they remove the semicolon
2330000	2336160	and they put they put in a comma. Now here is the craziness. I don't think you have it. But if you
2336160	2341440	have it, I'd be blown away impressed. We don't prepare for our shows. So we just we just wing it.
2343040	2351040	If you had an actual King James from the 1611 and I discuss this extensively in volume one,
2351040	2359280	let's get biblical and I have a picture. I have the 1611 1616 11 King James. If you had a I don't
2359280	2365120	know if you could do this online or whatever. I don't have the 18 for 1800 version. But I had
2365120	2372000	that I could get it online. If you could one you could pull it up online the actual 1611.
2372800	2381280	Daniel nine verse 25. Right in the 1611 King James, not in the 19th century King James,
2381280	2388320	not in 18th century King James, but the original 1611 in 1911 they actually pulled out the plates
2388880	2394880	and republished it. Yeah, this Bible is not any all the King James only churches do not use this
2394880	2399520	Bible anymore. It's not right. Not even readable. But do you want me to read it? It's beer. It's
2399520	2404720	barely readable. But this is the mindblower. I'll show it on the screen while reading it too. So
2404720	2411760	they can see the grammar and everything. Okay. Verse 25 says know therefore and understand with
2411760	2418960	a V that from going forth of the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem unto the Messiah,
2418960	2423760	the prince shall be suing weeks seven weeks and three score and stop stop right there.
2423760	2429920	All right. Stop right there. What happens after seven weeks? Forget the crazy spelling that it's
2429920	2435280	you instead of you score and what do you see there? Three score in two weeks. Before three
2435280	2444560	scores, there is an unambiguous grammatical notation. It's an esnach in Hebrew. And what is it
2444560	2452160	in the in the grammar there? There's a semicolon. Do you see that? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Thank you. There's
2452160	2459680	a semicolon, which means it's a stop full blown stop. So from the going forth the word, listen,
2459680	2463440	my friends, like you've never from the going forth the word, which means from the
2464160	2471040	slime, go back to Daniel 9 verse one and two from the destruction of the first temple until
2471680	2478480	an anointed one, a prince, the Messiah, the prince of the King James Translate will be seven weeks
2479600	2487040	stop. There's a semicolon there. Because in 1611, they didn't come up with this whole deal.
2487040	2491200	Now they wonder you think that's talking about Jesus because that already goes back
2491200	2495680	to the second surgery, but they never thought of compressing the two periods. Now,
2495680	2502800	here's what I want you to do. I want you to open up a modern King James. That means not the 1611.
2502800	2511280	Let's go to the one that was just published yesterday. Okay, and notice. Wow. Thank you.
2511280	2519840	Seven weeks, comma, no semicolon. Right. The same. See what happened is crazy, crazy, crazy.
2519840	2525280	That means, and just think about this for a moment. In what universe do you say 69 by saying
2525280	2533200	762? That's, that's ridiculous. And to prove it further, look at Daniel 9 verse 26, the next
2533200	2538720	path. Just so you want to make sure that Rabbi Singer is not some fanatic who hates Christianity
2538720	2544720	and is coming on here in order to just make, just so you know for sure that Daniel is interested
2544720	2550080	in this Gabriel speaking here that Daniel is interested in conveying a 62 week period.
2550080	2554480	Look at verse 26. What does it say there? And after three score and two weeks shall
2555760	2562640	it doesn't say after seven three score and two it says after three three score and two weeks after
2562640	2570960	62 weeks 62 times seven is 434 bingo. So when I said to you at the beginning of the broadcast
2570960	2578000	that this is going to make a humongous difference whether you're using a 1611 King James or 2022
2578000	2584640	to King James, I wasn't exaggerating. So you need to ask the Christian, how do you play with this?
2584640	2590400	And we have two anointed ones here. One after seven weeks, I mean 49 years, Cyrus the great.
2590400	2595120	How do you know he's the Messiah? It says so and Isaiah 45 verse one. It's really,
2595120	2600000	really famous. By the way, we've talked about this in the past. The people who were Trump supporters
2600000	2606480	said Cyrus is a picture of Trump and and had the coin of Trump was was president number 45.
2606480	2613120	I had that one actually. Yeah. So so there so that's how it's come. So there are two different
2613120	2618480	anointed ones. What the church does is it tries to compress it. There are more problems here than
2618480	2625680	you can imagine because as it turns out, if you say that the anointed one who's cut off is Jesus,
2626240	2631680	crucified according to Christian tradition, either in the year 30 or the year 33. Well,
2631680	2637120	that's not when the temple's destroyed. That means if let's say Jesus crucified the year 30,
2638080	2644560	it's not a consensus, but let's say we'll say 30. So from 30 to 70, is that a half a week?
2644560	2651360	What's the half a week? Like, what happened? It means from the time Jesus is executed by crucifixion
2651360	2658320	in the year 30, until the destruction of Second Temple is 40 years, 40 years is five and a half
2658320	2666000	weeks. It doesn't work. The whole thing completely collapses. Wow. Wow is right. So what happens is
2666000	2672480	the whole thing doesn't work. Because remember, in it, look very careful at Daniel nine, verse 26,
2672480	2678160	there's a prediction of the destruction, the people of the Prince will come, that's Rome,
2678160	2687680	and they will destroy what? The city and the sanctuary. This is not, this is not like Antiochus
2687680	2694240	Epiphanes. This is the destruction of the sanctuary. We know when that happened in the year 70.
2694240	2701280	Yeah. Really? It doesn't work. Whereas if it's a half a week prior to destruction in Temple,
2701280	2706320	that's the year 66. One point that's going to come up, people are going to ask this question,
2706320	2713760	so I want to head it off. The chronology of Herodotus for the period of the Persian Empire,
2713760	2718160	which means the length of the Second Temple, I don't want to get too advanced on this.
2718160	2726400	And the Jewish chronology are very different here. Herodotus is the, he's either called the
2726400	2732320	father of history, or as Xenophon fondly refers to him, and sister as the father of lies.
2732320	2740240	Herodotus, if you read any, he does make up a lot of stuff. I'll give you an example. He says
2740240	2745920	the people in the north are called the hyperborians, and they have one eye. They're like little,
2745920	2750240	little tiny guys with one eyes on their forehead. And they have gold guarding griffins that fly
2750240	2756960	around flying lines. And then he said that King Cyrus got killed for going up into the land of
2756960	2763360	the Scythians and some throw chop his head off, but other historians not like what? That didn't
2763360	2772080	happen. So yeah, that's just to give some examples. There are, this is, this is, it's a good
2772080	2780640	geography stories referred to Herodotus as words, but just in completely insane. If you
2780640	2786960	read it, you could pick any article on Herodotus, any encyclopedia you want. I'm making this up.
2786960	2793920	I don't know this for sure, but I'm guessing within, I'm fairly confident within 75 words,
2793920	2800880	it's going to talk about Herodotus's lies and all the problems around this. Just stuff, right.
2801440	2806400	You one of his maps? He makes a map of the world as a little circle, right? It's like,
2806960	2811040	just a little circle. It's like, right. There are places he said he's been where we know he
2811040	2816160	hasn't been. There are whole dissertations been written, not one thousands of dissertations.
2816160	2822640	He said the Arabian worship Dionysus. What? Right. I mean, it's, it's not that he made a
2822640	2829120	mistake. I mean, this is the ancient world. No, no, no, he, so there's a fear that he was just
2829120	2833760	bat nuts out of his mind and just made up stuff and he was lying through his teeth.
2833760	2840800	Yeah, I mean, ours. Yeah. Yeah. So this is, so I want to explain this point. So there is a,
2842480	2848880	there is a considerable difference between, and I write about this in less biblical volume one,
2848880	2853600	there's a considerable difference of the Jewish chronology of the length of the Persian Empire
2853600	2860240	and the secular chronology, which relies on Herodotus. We don't. So just so you understand
2860720	2867120	this. So the period therefore of in some, the period that we're discussing here is a 490-year
2867120	2875360	period, 70 plus 420. And the anointed one who's cut off is my great-great-grandfather, and that's
2875360	2881280	the priesthood. The term cut off, not Yikari means cut off, removed. It could be killed.
2881280	2886160	Doesn't mean that. If he wanted to say killed, it'll be Yahare would be killed. Doesn't say that
2886160	2891920	at all. And that happens when a half a week, if you ask Christians, by the way, what do you do
2891920	2896320	with the last week? They have no clue. If you ask the Christian, but wait, there's another week and
2896320	2900960	then there's a half a week, when did that week happen? There's no answer. How is it that Jesus
2900960	2908480	was crucified near 30, but the sanctuary is destroyed 40 years later, when you have a prophecy
2908480	2914720	that happens immediately after, there is no possible answer. I'll tell you this, I did the
2914800	2922000	forensics on this. I wanted to find out who started this, who made this, who
2922000	2928320	came up with the idea, because as I mentioned at the outset, Daniel 9, this whole thing with
2928320	2932160	the dating is not in the Christian Bible. They didn't think of this stuff. They didn't come up
2932160	2938880	with this one. And it basically comes down to the time of Irenaeus, meaning basically late
2938880	2946320	second century. Yeah, you could tell, yeah. Right. And, but it's funny because it almost
2946320	2953760	makes you wonder if after, so after the temple's already destroyed, Paul writes his stuff, Paul
2953760	2957520	doesn't do any of this stuff. He doesn't even get into the years or nothing. So you know that Paul
2957520	2962080	is not talking about this or thinking about this, like you mentioned before. But it makes you wonder
2962160	2968960	if going forward, the church or early Christians are looking back in the text
2968960	2974000	and trying to plug these numbers in, because it's like, okay, Jesus, well, you know, the destruction
2974000	2978240	of the temple is sort of close to what he was crucified, 40 years, give or take. Oh, he was
2978240	2982480	probably born at the year one then, which wasn't the year one. I'm just saying that just so we
2982480	2987680	can understand. The year one didn't happen for like, what, 700 years? What is it like?
2987680	2993600	Way, way later. Anyways, but anyways, they're probably making these dates fit. And we don't
2993600	2999360	even know when Jesus was born. If he was born in 4 BC, he had to have been at least born in 4 BC,
2999360	3004160	because that's when Herod died. Matthew. Yeah, right. So like, have to be so the numbers are
3004160	3010480	even less than two, right? Right. So Matthew, yeah, that's what I'm trying to get. Right, right.
3010480	3016320	The guy who invented our year, that means like, we're in 2022, like, who came up with that? And
3016320	3022400	when did people start using that? So it was a sixth century monk, his name was Danesius Exegius,
3022400	3028320	which literally means Danny the dwarf. I have no idea how that happened. And that's what I'm,
3028320	3033360	and that's what he was doing. He was trying to make the numbers fit to 70. Right, right, right,
3033360	3040400	which he was close, but it just doesn't match. Just literally impossible. I don't envy him because
3040480	3048800	as it turns out, as you know, Matthew Luke, date Jesus's birth of more than a decade apart,
3048800	3055520	as you mentioned, Matthew has Jesus born, while Herod the Great is still alive. And Herod the
3055520	3060720	Great is saying in Matthew's infancy narrative, that look at look, you know, kill all the kids
3060720	3069120	who two years years older and younger. Therefore, six BC would be, I had a rabbi who once said,
3069120	3074160	isn't it interesting that according to Matthew, Jesus was born six years before Christ? That's
3074160	3085760	a whole different joke. It's so crazy. According to Luke, Jesus was born during the time that the
3085760	3093200	governor of Syria took over from Herod Archelaus, Uranus, that's the year six C, we know that.
3093200	3099920	So they're actually 11 years apart. There's no year zero. So, I mean, what was dynasty as you
3099920	3103840	was going to come up with? I mean, this is sixth century. I mean, the lights went out in the sixth
3103840	3110000	century. You know, kudos to you for trying to come up. He's basically trying to do a tation,
3110000	3115200	you know, a diatesson where he's trying to merge everything together. It doesn't work. He tried
3115200	3119440	his best. Yeah. And that's what I was just going to say. Like, it's one of those things that you
3119440	3125760	look at and you're like, wow, they almost made that fit. They almost did. But it's like, but once
3125760	3130080	you look at it, once you actually get to the numbers and you actually plug in the numbers,
3130080	3135600	look at Matthew when he was born, when all this happened, you're like, no, it doesn't, it literally
3135600	3140800	is impossible for this to fit. And then you would have to ask yourself this question. If it's so
3140800	3147600	close, oh, it's so close. Well, we're talking about God here, is God going to be close? Is it going
3147600	3152960	to be a couple of years off? Or is he going to be this is going to be right on? So you can't,
3152960	3157920	it can't be that way. It's close enough. Come on, we're four years, three years here. No,
3157920	3165200	it doesn't work that way. It's not, it's not right. It's not on. Right. So it's, I'm heating up your
3165200	3171920	point. Well, it's not just a matter of how much time so 11 years, let's stop being so picky,
3172880	3182240	it's two different periods. Herod the Great dies in four BC. His son, Herod Archelaus takes over
3182240	3191120	and he governs over Judea. Herod, Herod the Great was insane. He was a maniac. His son was crazier
3191120	3196800	than his dad. Yeah, was totally insane. That fits into Matthew where Joseph is born. Don't go back
3196800	3203520	to Bethlehem. It's hard. Herod Archelaus was so crazy that he was too nuts and too anti-Jewish and
3203520	3208720	too violent for the Romans and they fired. This is the very big point. So they were just the puppets
3208720	3213280	of Augustus. Right. That means they're all puppets. These are not really the king of the Jews. They
3213280	3218480	call themselves that. They all are answering to the emperor of Rome. But Paul, you know, as far as
3218480	3223280	the emperor of Rome is going to call yourself what you want. I don't just pay the taxes and you're
3223280	3230400	fine. That's what was going on. So Herod the Great dies in four BC. Herod Archelaus takes
3230400	3237440	over the region called Judea, which essentially is everything south of Jerusalem. Herod Archelaus
3237440	3242880	was a psychopath. Definitely inherited his father's craziness. There was no Haldol. There was no
3242880	3248000	lithium at the time. And he went berserk and ultimately was a slaughter of Jews in the temple
3248000	3255760	in the year six CE over a Passover massacre. The Romans go, you are crazy. I mean, imagine
3255760	3261920	if you are so nuts that you're too crazy for the Romans. And the Romans says, Herod Archelaus,
3261920	3267200	you're out and he's fired. This is like very well known. And then he brings in and he goes,
3267840	3271760	let's take that Gentile from Syria, who's the governor there, Uranus,
3271760	3279600	Uranus, and bring him in. And then he not only has Syria, but he also governs now over Judea.
3279600	3285680	Okay, so we know when that happened. I mean, they can't be the same. That's six years. Right.
3285680	3290880	Exactly. We know when all that happens. We have multiple sources on this. So this is not like,
3290880	3296080	and of course, Matthew and Luke go in two different directions. Right. Luke has the family,
3296080	3301920	you know, start off in Nazareth, and then go to Bethlehem because of the census. That's the
3302480	3307360	plot device that Luke is using following the birth of Jesus. He's not born at home,
3307360	3312800	as in Matthew. He's born in a manger because there's no room at the end. I just heard a Christian
3312800	3317600	apologies. I'm not going to say who, but he's a fairly well known guy. He's say in a debate with
3317600	3324560	a really well known non Christian New Testament scholar that the Mary and Joseph had two homes.
3324640	3329680	I'm not, I'm not kidding. I'm not going to name me because I don't want to embarrass anyone. Yeah.
3329680	3333120	Okay, so I need to say this because I don't know if anyone's going to say this.
3334320	3338080	In, you need to know this because I just saw this in the debate that just occurred like a month
3338080	3344960	ago. I'm not naming me because it doesn't interest me. So what happens is the non Christian New
3344960	3352640	Testament scholar said correctly that Mary and Joseph in Luke's view, start off their home is
3352640	3360080	in Nazareth. The census forces them to move to Bethlehem. Why? Because Joseph is a descendant
3360080	3368560	of King David. Okay. Just look at Luke chapter one verse 27. Okay. It's really right there. Okay.
3368560	3375520	Now they then after the child is born, and they then go back to Jerusalem drew just so you know
3375520	3382400	if you draw a line from Nazareth to Bethlehem, it would basically pass through Jerusalem. The
3382400	3387520	distance is not that far. Let's say it's 90 miles, something like that. Okay. So they, she then
3387520	3394080	after the month period, she then brings the necessary offerings in the temple and then
3394080	3399920	heads back home in Matthew. It's entirely reversed the families originally from Bethlehem.
3399920	3405120	And then the family has to go down to Egypt and wait to death of Herod. And then Joseph is born.
3405120	3411840	You can't go back home. Because the new guy Herod Archaeologists crazy and his dad, and therefore
3411840	3418160	they go to Nazareth. I saw this in a debate with this Christian, who's an who's a knowledgeable guy,
3418160	3426480	this Christian apologist answered this by saying that actually Mary and Joseph had two homes.
3426480	3434080	They had one home in Nazareth and another home in Bethlehem. Okay. And I'm sorry that the non
3434080	3439200	Christian didn't respond, but he should have responded. That's completely ridiculous. Why?
3439200	3445520	Because see Luke chapter two verse seven. It says in Luke, remember, they don't have a home in
3445520	3451600	they don't have a home in Luke. I'm giving this all the way. They don't have a home in Bethlehem.
3451600	3459120	Joseph and Mary are from Nazareth. And there's no room at the hotel at the end. Right. Right.
3459360	3467680	Jesus went in a manger. Right. Now, I don't, I don't, I was watching it and rooting and going,
3467680	3474960	wait, there's a, they couldn't have had two homes. The whole point of Luke is that Jesus was born
3474960	3482320	in the most distressed, the most humble place possible, a place where horses eat from a manger,
3482320	3490080	a trough. And why Luke says, because there's no room at the end, there's no room at the hotel.
3490080	3497120	But if, as the Christians say, that Mary and Joseph had two homes, one in the Galilee and one
3497120	3502160	in Judea and Bethlehem, why would they have to give, why would they have to go into a barn to
3502160	3507040	give birth? Why don't just give birth in your home? And I'm sorry that the non Christian didn't get
3507040	3511840	that one. Yeah, that's, that's, that's very obvious. That's like, right. I'll be a brain
3511840	3517200	scientist to figure that one out. Right. So in Bethlehem, notice, and therefore you can project
3517200	3524240	from that. So Matthew, would we expect in the book of Matthew to have any mention of a manger?
3524240	3528880	No, because their home is in Bethlehem. That's what they originally, that's a starting point.
3528880	3534640	What's happening essentially is Matthew and Luke are independently inventing two different
3534720	3540240	infancy narratives, or collecting an oral tradition of the infancy narrative in two different places
3540240	3546480	and come up with two separate incompatible devices to get Jesus to be born in the city
3546480	3551840	in which King David was born. King David was born in Bethlehem. See first Samuel, chapter 17,
3551840	3557840	verse 58. So, but they independently come up with this. So this is an L source and an M source.
3557840	3561200	And then the whole thing explodes, but it's too late to
3561200	3566240	to rectify because you have, I mean, people think that like at the end of the first century,
3566240	3569760	people had a Bible like we have together. No, there were certain communities that had the
3569760	3573840	book of Luke, some communities that only had the book of Mark, and some only Matthew. By the time
3573840	3578240	you get to the second century, it's too late. And by the time Irenaeus, the bishop of Leon,
3578240	3583760	saying these are the four, that's it. It's all locked up. Isn't that crazy? Yeah.
3584960	3589040	Yeah, that's, there's a lot. You just, I just learned a lot in this.
3589600	3594880	Wasn't that intense? Yeah. Right. And it turns out I won't name names, but there are Christian
3594880	3600480	evangelical scholars who to their credit can see that these are completely incompatible.
3600480	3606240	Yep. Oh yeah, I've talked to those people. Yeah. And I don't want, but they're, they know this can't
3606240	3611920	work. Right. And therefore the entire, it's very obvious what's happening here, what's happening
3611920	3617680	in Daniel's mind is, is they already have an idea. And then there's a bias confirmation,
3618080	3624400	they want to have Daniel 9 predict the date of Jesus' crucifixion. They don't care how it's done.
3624400	3631520	And then they go back, scour through texts, and then twist the passages, change the, the, the
3632080	3638720	anointed to capital M Messiah, put the definite article, it doesn't exist there. And then just
3638720	3644000	chop it up, take out the semicolon that's done somewhere between 1611. Now it's done in the
3644000	3649920	19th century, then the semicolon puff just disappears. There is the unambiguous of a
3649920	3656320	grammatical device called an Esnacht, which is there. And if you're going, well, the Esnacht
3656320	3661200	was invented by the Messerites. I mean, it's a, it's a grammatical device. If you think that the
3661200	3668640	Messerite just made it up in what universe is 760 and two, the way you say 69. And in case you're
3668640	3674640	saying, I don't believe Rabbi Singer, just look at Daniel 9 verse 26. It says after the 62 weeks,
3674640	3682880	doesn't say after the 69 weeks bingo, dead, it's over. This is why Christians do not teach their
3682880	3688960	children the Hebrew language, despite the fact that Christians believe that the Hebrew language
3689520	3696960	was used to convey, convey eternal oracles. They can easily Christians could do exactly what the
3696960	3703760	Jewish people can do. And that is enough with the Latin and teach biblical Hebrew to young boys
3703760	3710320	and girls. They don't. If Christians could read the Jewish Bible in its original language, they'd
3710320	3718240	be leaving the church. Now Christians can study Hebrew as an adult. Go to college, take biblical,
3718240	3722400	it takes years. I mean, when you're an adult, language doesn't come to you. But it's too late,
3722480	3726640	you're already bought into the system. And then you're reading everything through a
3726640	3731440	Christologic grid and become really very difficult. But this is why, you know,
3732000	3736880	Christian schools for kids, they're not teaching there. They're not teaching Hebrew to the kids.
3736880	3741680	You want to take biblical Hebrew and full of theological Dallas Theological Buddha Bible
3741680	3746240	Institute, you're 19 or 20 years old. I mean, if you want to be pastor, I don't know how many
3746240	3750480	semesters you got to do a biblical Hebrew, you're not going to be able to barely make out a word.
3751200	3755840	Right. You're done, you're smoked, you're fried, you have no chance at all. And then I think, you
3755840	3762160	know, you know, I think that's why the King James only that's where they get their traction
3762160	3768080	from what like why would anyone believe that, that folks from the Church of England,
3768080	3772640	that 47 men and good standing from the Church of England, that they would rightfully as divinely
3772640	3778640	inspired. And to their credit, even though, you know, it's easy to mock the idea,
3779600	3786400	because they don't have a holy language, the King James has come to replace their holy language,
3786400	3793200	right, because they have no access to the Hebrew. I mean, even if you think that a movement is insane,
3793200	3799520	like a King James only is sounds crazy, you do have to ask the question, but like, why is the
3799520	3807760	what is generating the 67 what is, what is the spark? And if they don't have access to a holy
3807760	3814160	language, then they then what happens then the, then the King James and the kind of Jacobian
3814160	3820320	English, it's not really anymore, but it's been cleaned up a lot. Yeah, it's that the King Val
3820320	3826880	art, so on. Verily, I sent you words that are, it gives people something that becomes the holy
3826880	3832240	language. Yes, that's what's really going on. It's Shakespeare, too. It's Shakespeare language.
3832320	3837440	And that's what's so funny about it. It's like, it become like you said, it's the archaic English
3837440	3842880	language. You know, when the King James was written, there were no Jews in England.
3843520	3850880	The Jews, there was not a single Jew in England in 1611. Wow. The Jews had been expelled centuries
3850880	3859040	early. There were no Jews there. None, not a Jew to be found in in England. Jews would not return
3859120	3863840	to England until 40 years after the death of Shakespeare. Shakespeare is alive and
3863840	3869520	during the time when the King James Bible is published. Yeah, as I said, just a dozen years
3869520	3872400	after the merchant, I mean, he's writing the Merchant of Venice, having never,
3873440	3878560	Shakespeare never met a Jew in his life, ever by the Calvin. He was part of the Kingsman,
3878560	3883440	which was a, right, who was funded by King James. It was in the same court and it had
3883440	3889360	Shakespeare and all the plays that you, all the plays that we know, all the Macbeth and all those
3889360	3894400	from like 1604 to 1610 around the same time they're writing the King James Bible. It's all
3894400	3901520	happening in the same decade. I wanted to just submit one other thing for evangelicals to consider
3901520	3909360	this ponder about this. Evangelical Christians are not fond of the Church of the Latter-day Saints.
3910160	3914640	They consider the Mormons to be a cult. I'm not making this up for those who are not familiar
3914640	3920960	with this. Oh yeah. If you ever refer to a Mormon, right, if you ever refer to a Mormon as a Christian
3921520	3928480	in the presence of an evangelical or a Roman Catholic, they'll say they are not Christians.
3928480	3933840	This is a, they're called a cult. They can't stand them, not personally, but theologically can't
3933840	3939440	stand them. You can call a Catholic a Christian in front of a Baptist and you can get away with
3939440	3946320	that, but you will never get away with calling a Mormon a Christian like Senator Orrin Hatch just
3946320	3950720	passed away. You know, they would never refer to him as a Christian because he was a Mormon. Okay.
3950720	3956240	This is, I want you to listen very carefully. I've never said this publicly. If you ask an
3956240	3963280	evangelical Christian, why don't you believe in the Church of the Latter-day Saints? What's wrong
3963280	3969200	with it? So they would give you a whole list of problems with it. They would say that it's in,
3970240	3976480	it's incompatible with the teachings of the New Testament, the Book of Mormon. They would say that
3976480	3982400	Joseph Smith is whatever, he was a, he was quite a prankster and so on, blah, blah, blah, whole
3982400	3992240	bunch of, but in that list, evangelical say to you that in the Book of Mormon, a ton of the Jewish
3992240	3998400	Bible is quoted. That means the Hebrew Bible is quoted all over the place. More than 20 chapters
3998400	4004080	of the Book of Isaiah appears in the Book of Mormon. And guess what? In the Book of Mormon,
4005360	4010960	which version of the Bible is used was revealed to Joseph Smith through the Angel Moroni, the
4010960	4016800	King James Version, the 1611 Version. And even evangelical Christians, well appealing to the
4016800	4025520	Christian, properly and correctly laugh and go, why would the Angel Moroni be quoting the 1611
4025520	4031840	Bible? Like did the angels forget Hebrew? Like why would the angels be quoting the 1611? I'm not
4031840	4039440	making, so this is like a big deal because all over the Book of Mormon, huge swaths of passages
4039440	4046800	all over the Jewish Bible is quoted and it's straight King James, King James 1611. And evangelicals,
4046800	4052000	this is why I appeal to the evangelical, use that critical thinking when you start quoting
4052000	4058960	Septuagint. Use that critical thinking when you start quoting King James. I mean, if you understand
4058960	4066160	that the Book of Mormon is a book that does not deserve your respect, attention, should not be
4066480	4072800	you should not be relied upon, is not credible for many reasons, including that it's using the
4072800	4079040	King James Version, then apply that in the same angle. Holy moly. Why would I think that the
4079040	4083920	Writers of the Testament are relying on the Septuagint? Right. Just like wake up and people
4083920	4089440	don't think about such a good point. Yeah, right. Like, like, you reject, you're rejecting all these
4089440	4095840	other iterations of Christianity, then use the same critical thinking and apply it to what you
4095840	4103280	belong to apply it to your iteration of Christian ago. What? I mean, the Holy Spirit was using the
4103280	4111200	Septuagint to inform Matthew how to write Matthew 123, really like God, the Holy Spirit, the third
4111200	4117200	person of the Trinity, just forgot how to read Hebrew and decided to be reading from a translation.
4117280	4125600	Does that make sense to anyone? This is clearly written for a different purpose,
4126640	4133040	and it's being repurposed by Christians, tweaked, even changed and altered in some areas,
4133040	4139360	for example, capitalizing letters and changing stuff. And you can see clearly that it just
4139360	4145040	doesn't match. Like, do the check the numbers, the numbers don't match up. But for what you
4145040	4148720	were saying in the beginning, it does match up, where you talk about the temple actually
4148720	4154160	being destroyed, and the priesthood being cut down. That's right. It matches precisely with
4154160	4160080	history. I want to convey this again. You know, many New Testament scholars, even I've done shows
4160080	4167760	with them and, you know, they're much nicer than I am about this. They go, well, I had some way.
4167760	4173520	No, this is, we're not talking about, you know, there was a wrong approach or whatever. This is
4173520	4180880	chicanery. This is the kind of stuff that if you're an attorney in the United States, and you
4180880	4186400	played with the contract, and that was discovered, you'd be disbarred for that. You'd be thrown in
4186400	4192480	prison in the United States, or any civilized country for engaging in this kind of tampering
4192480	4197120	with contracts. And that's not an ordinary, this is not a real estate contract. This is,
4197120	4202480	you believe the Word of God. What does that say to you? I mean, why would you play with the Word
4202480	4207040	of God? And not only, and even outside of the Bible, like when you get this, the Josephus,
4207680	4213760	the famous text about Josephus, with the text, testimony and Flavianum, we know that's been
4213760	4219520	altered and interpolated and even basically just hacked up. And like you get other areas where
4219520	4224480	Eusebius just makes up stories that didn't happen. Once you, like, like, like you were mentioning,
4224480	4229600	this was in a court case, there'd be people going to jail over this, this, you would be no longer
4229600	4235440	a credible, credible witness. There's nothing you could say anymore that we should listen to.
4235440	4238480	We're getting caught all over the place, getting caught with the Bible, getting caught outside
4238480	4244080	of the Bible, the church is all corrupt. Like, it just doesn't look, like if this is the real
4244080	4249920	religion of a real God, he you would think there would be some order going on here and not just
4249920	4256080	a bunch of criminals making stuff up, getting caught left and right. You're raising a very,
4256080	4263760	very hot item. And that's testimony and Flavian antiquities 1833. Right. The reason why this is
4263760	4270320	insane that you brought that up, because this is amping it up further. Here, all scholars,
4270320	4276320	Christian or non Christian concede that this text has been completely corrupted. The only
4276320	4283520	argument is, is it a complete invention? That means the whole thing about Jesus being in Christ,
4283520	4290240	who was a man, if you can call him a man, means everyone agrees that this is a this has been
4290240	4295440	corrupted. There's no like some people going around. No, no, it was really a Christian zero
4295440	4300720	people say that. I mean, you have to really be drinking an enormous amount of propofol. I don't
4300720	4305920	know if you could drink it. I mean, you have no idea how much Johnny Walker you have to drink
4305920	4311680	to consume to believe that I mean, Josephus wasn't I see increase. It's literally the nice
4311680	4316240	see increase just injected into the text. And what's so crazy about this, though,
4316880	4323760	is that we all even scholars and atheists and critical scholars, we all and believers alike,
4323760	4328000	all of us when we talk about this testimony in Flavianum, we can get into this more on another
4328000	4333520	day. But just real quick, what blows my mind and I don't understand this, I literally to this day,
4333520	4339200	I'm like, in shock that we talk about this, like it's not that big of a deal. Like, yeah,
4339280	4344160	they just just altered the text a little bit. But you know, so wait, hold on, pause it for a
4344160	4350640	second. Shouldn't this should this should be like all over the place? Like, it doesn't matter if it
4350640	4356880	was originally some skeleton version of this or not, whether it's all invented and all forged
4356880	4363360	completely, or if it's interpolated, that is a big deal. That should be like, holy crap, the church
4363360	4367840	is messing around and trying to change things. If it's if this is all true, they shouldn't have
4367920	4373920	to do anything. Let the word be the word and let it let God do his thing. Why are you have to
4373920	4382000	why to do all these extra stuff? Right? That's what I'm getting at. Right. So here's where it goes.
4382560	4390720	If Christian scribes were perfectly willing to corrupt their own New Testament, for example,
4390720	4396480	add in 12 verses at the end of the book of Mark, because Mark has no appearances,
4396480	4404480	resurrection appearances, it ends at chapter 16, verse eight, if they're willing to mess with their
4404480	4410640	own New Testament, adding in the story of the adulterous woman in in the book of John,
4411600	4419200	to chain to add in Luke 22 19, half of that passage and all of verse 20 is added in because
4420240	4425040	Luke didn't have the Eucharist didn't doesn't have vicarious atonement. So therefore,
4425840	4430560	if they're willing to mess with their own Christian Bible, what do you think they would do to
4430560	4435600	Josephus? Like Josephus is not considered a holy book to them. Right. And incidentally,
4436240	4442560	loads of church fathers quoted Josephus, origin was a genius, origin was a third century church
4442560	4449520	father, no doubt the bride. He didn't even know that that verse was there. He wouldn't. That means
4450400	4457280	he's calling Josephus up and down. I do want this third century. Origin, just so you know,
4457280	4462160	was only one of two church fathers that's that was completely fluent in Hebrew, only him and
4462160	4468960	Jerome. Yeah, origin was really was a genius. He was a prodigy in his teens already. He was
4468960	4475280	Jerome says that he wrote 2000 books in his life. That might be an exaggeration, but he was just
4476080	4481760	he was really quite. He knew Josephus backwards and forth. He didn't think that was important.
4481760	4489040	Moreover, origin says in his commentary on Matthew chapter 16, that Josephus was not a Christian.
4489040	4495600	Yeah, he's too bad he didn't believe in Jesus. Right. He said he he says that it means zero
4495600	4500880	church fathers. Nobody and suddenly at the same time of the council I see approximately,
4500880	4508640	you see it as you said the the the historian of the church, right? He he's the one
4508640	4514000	who's responsible for inserting testimony in Flavium. But this shouldn't come to surprise
4514000	4520240	anyone because you have a criminal endeavor already changing the Hebrew Bible in order
4520240	4526560	to make it appear Christological, changing the Christian Bible in order so that Mark matches
4526640	4532480	Matthew. And that's why my friends Luke didn't believe in vicarious atonement didn't believe
4532480	4539040	that Jesus died as a as a sin offering as a ransom for your sins. And that's why you'll have in
4539040	4545920	Mark chapter 10 verse 45 and Matthew chapter 20 verse 28, the reference to Jesus died as a ransom
4545920	4550320	for your sins, but appears nowhere in the book of Luke because Luke didn't believe in that.
4550320	4557680	And therefore they had to corrupt Luke 22 in order so that the Eucharist Luke matches Matthew
4557680	4563120	and Mark. If they would do that to their own Bible, what do you think they would do to Josephus?
4563120	4569520	I mean, this is a no brainer. Exactly. Yep. Well, this has been fun, like always. And
4570560	4575360	yeah, and he also want to add in anything going on books, anything like that. Yeah,
4575360	4582640	I mean, you know, my books are, let's get biblical and have a fairly large channel on YouTube. And
4582640	4589040	it was a joy to do this with you. And I look forward to doing another program and it was just
4589040	4594640	great. This is a very exciting topic. Yes, it is. And like I always say, you have just attained true
4594720	4599840	gnosis. You have just attained true gnosis.
4602720	4605440	The demiurge has no power over
