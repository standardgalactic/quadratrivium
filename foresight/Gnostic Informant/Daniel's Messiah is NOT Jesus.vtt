00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
There are two anointed ones spoken here in these passages at the end of Daniel's mind.

00:05.280 --> 00:12.080
There's one anointed one who comes after seven weeks, which means after 49 years, namely that

00:12.080 --> 00:19.120
Cyrus. How do you know? Because Tove says it. Forget Tovia. Look at Isaiah 45 verse 1. Cyrus is God's

00:19.120 --> 00:27.840
Messiah, God's Messiah. It says it explicitly. But only here in Daniel's mind do they translate

00:27.840 --> 00:36.560
the word Messiah has Messiah and it goes further. They then capitalize the word Messiah. Open up

00:36.560 --> 00:42.160
your King James right now. Open up your new American standard right now. Open up your new

00:42.160 --> 00:52.640
NIV right now. Messiah is capitalized. Now here is the here is the ultimate brain just the brain

00:53.440 --> 00:58.240
and that is there is no such thing as a capital letter in the Hebrew language.

00:58.800 --> 01:07.440
In Isaiah 45 verse 1, do you think that the word anointed is capitalized or not capitalized?

01:08.880 --> 01:15.760
Until an anointed one, a prince, the Messiah, the Prince of the King James translate,

01:15.920 --> 01:23.280
be seven weeks. Stop. There's a semicolon there. Here's what I want you to do. I want you to open

01:23.280 --> 01:31.520
up a modern King James. That means not the 1611. Let's go to the one that was just published

01:31.520 --> 01:41.280
yesterday. Okay. And notice. Wow. Thanks. So what happened? This is mind blowing. I mean your front

01:41.280 --> 01:50.800
alone should be shooting through your cerebellum and I don't even know what I just said.

01:50.800 --> 02:14.880
Welcome back to the Gnostic Informant and you are about to attain true gnosis. And I'm with Rabbi

02:14.880 --> 02:20.400
Tobias Singer now, back by popular demand as always. You know, after a couple of weeks, people

02:20.400 --> 02:24.160
started people started asking in the comment section, where's the rabbi? Where's where's he been?

02:24.880 --> 02:33.360
I know. So you know, I gotta I do I do what I'm told you don't know. But anyway, anyways, I want to

02:33.360 --> 02:41.440
talk to you about Daniel and this. So like I said before, last time you were on, right, I get

02:41.520 --> 02:45.040
these emails from people and they watch my they watch us they watch you and they're listening

02:45.040 --> 02:48.800
intently and they want to learn. Like, oh, you guys are making good points. These are

02:48.800 --> 02:54.480
unfalsifiable points are making. We can look these up. We could check the Hebrew. And sure enough,

02:54.480 --> 02:59.680
you guys are right. But and I always get these, you always get these butts. And then there's a

02:59.680 --> 03:04.240
couple more questions at a tackle done. It's like, Okay, Isaiah 53. Okay, you're right. It's the

03:04.240 --> 03:08.160
suffering servants Israel. We got it. You guys, you guys are right. All right. And then say like,

03:08.160 --> 03:12.560
okay, the the the virgin thing you guys are right about that. Okay, whatever, you're right,

03:12.560 --> 03:18.800
you know, Alma, but you got that. But now I got you. I got you in check now. I'm like, Okay,

03:18.800 --> 03:27.520
what is it now? Daniel, Daniel nine. Who else could Daniel be talking about when he talks about

03:27.520 --> 03:34.000
the 70 weeks, the anointed one will be cut down. Right. It's so clear that that's Jesus.

03:34.960 --> 03:38.560
So I'm going to throw it right over to you. You can take as much time as you need. Explain

03:38.560 --> 03:44.160
to us what this means. And how how does it get so misinterpreted?

03:45.280 --> 03:51.840
It should be said from the outset that if someone concedes Isaiah 53, which they would have to,

03:51.840 --> 03:58.160
as you said, the context that demands it, and concedes Isaiah chapter seven is not talking

03:58.240 --> 04:05.600
about the birth of a Messiah 700 years later, you then control the New Testament in the place

04:05.600 --> 04:13.040
that it belongs the garbage, because that demonstrates that Matthew was misappropriating

04:13.040 --> 04:20.000
passages from the Hebrew Bible, and both Isaiah seven and Isaiah 53 are used in the New Testament.

04:20.000 --> 04:27.360
Philip famously used that with the with the eunuch from Gaza and Matthew 123. But Daniel nine,

04:27.360 --> 04:34.080
you're right, stands out alone. Very, very unique because Christians will say Daniel nine is very

04:34.080 --> 04:42.640
different here because here we have a precise prediction of exactly when the Messiah is going

04:42.640 --> 04:49.840
to be killed going to be crucified. We have the timing. It is perfectly set up and is outlined

04:49.840 --> 04:57.520
in the last four passages of the ninth chapter of Daniel. How could you deny Christ? Now it was

04:57.520 --> 05:04.240
very striking about this. I brought up the Isaiah 53 and Isaiah seven, not just because you did,

05:05.280 --> 05:10.560
but there's something very striking about Daniel nine. And that is the writers of the New Testament

05:10.560 --> 05:16.720
did not consider that to be very important. In fact, nowhere in the Christian Bible did the

05:16.720 --> 05:24.400
authors think or record that Daniel nine predicts the date of the Messiah's death. I mean, you would

05:24.400 --> 05:31.120
have to believe that Paul knew that Daniel nine predicted that the Messiah would be cut off,

05:31.120 --> 05:38.160
killed after 70 weeks. And Paul just didn't think that was important enough to mention,

05:38.160 --> 05:43.440
you'd have to believe that the writers of all four Gospels and the letters of Peter and John,

05:43.440 --> 05:47.200
no one thought it was important enough. So it's mentioned nowhere. And in a moment,

05:47.200 --> 05:54.320
you're going to understand why there's probably no text in the Hebrew scriptures that has been

05:54.320 --> 06:02.720
mangled more extensively than the ninth chapter of Daniel. And we're going to talk about what's

06:02.720 --> 06:16.560
going on there. Daniel is using a is using a unit of time that you, the viewer need to know before

06:16.560 --> 06:25.200
we can get started. And that is, he's using terms of days and weeks to represent years. So a week

06:25.200 --> 06:37.280
in Daniel nine is meant to represent seven years. So 70 weeks is 490 years. And what the church

06:37.280 --> 06:44.720
had to do was to alter the last four passages of Daniel nine, in order to make it look like

06:44.720 --> 06:51.280
the Messiah is going to come and he's going to be cut off. And he's going to be killed

06:51.840 --> 06:57.040
before the destruction of the second temple. This is exactly how it's going to be presented to you.

06:57.680 --> 07:06.160
But in order to accomplish this feat, they had to change the text. Now, one point your

07:06.160 --> 07:14.560
viewers must understand if you don't get this, you're going to be lost. The word Messiah anointed

07:15.360 --> 07:26.400
Messiah is mentioned 39 times in the Hebrew Bible. 39 times is that word appear. As it turns out,

07:26.400 --> 07:34.080
it is never referring to the Messiah, who we refer to as the Messiah, never. It refers to that's

07:34.080 --> 07:39.280
right. So this is like a huge surprise. If you don't get this, you're not going to get anything.

07:40.080 --> 07:46.160
The word appears in the book of Leviticus more frequently than any other. And there is referring

07:46.160 --> 07:54.880
to priests, Kohanim, Ahmad the Senate of Aaron. So I people from my tribe from my family line are

07:54.880 --> 08:04.800
called anointed. Now, in every other instance in the Hebrew Bible, with the word Messiah appears,

08:05.520 --> 08:11.440
the Christian Bibles, the King James, the new international version, all of them line up all

08:11.440 --> 08:24.960
the usual characters correctly translate the word Messiah as anointed. But only here in Daniel 9

08:24.960 --> 08:33.120
do they translate the word Messiah as Messiah, and it goes further. They then capitalize the

08:33.200 --> 08:39.440
word Messiah. Open up your King James right now. Open up your new American standard right now. Open

08:39.440 --> 08:49.120
up your new NIV right now. Messiah is capitalized. Now here is the here is the ultimate brain,

08:49.680 --> 08:55.840
just the brain screw. And that is, there is no such thing as a capital letter in the Hebrew

08:55.840 --> 08:59.600
language. I found that out the hard way. I found that out the hard way. When I started looking

08:59.600 --> 09:05.440
into Hebrew, I said, wait, wait, wait, where's the where's the capital? There's no capitalized

09:05.440 --> 09:11.360
no way. And then I was like, okay, that changes a lot of things. You know, people wonder why I care

09:11.360 --> 09:16.800
about Christians so much. And why don't I get angry when I interact with Christians? The reason I

09:16.800 --> 09:21.360
don't is I feel so sorry for them. My heart goes out to them. And if I was in their predicament,

09:21.360 --> 09:27.120
that means I've read no Hebrew, I didn't say no word to Hebrew, even though Christians firmly

09:27.120 --> 09:32.080
believe that the Bible, the Hebrew scriptures was originally written in Hebrew slash is a

09:32.080 --> 09:37.360
little Aramaic. But it's it's the even they believe that the Hebrew is the word of God,

09:37.360 --> 09:42.400
but they can't read a word of it. And they are utterly dependent on the translators,

09:42.400 --> 09:47.440
so much so. And you know, this right Christians argue over which is the right translation. There's

09:47.440 --> 09:52.400
some Christians that believe that only the King James like what I mean, if it was good enough

09:52.400 --> 09:58.240
for Peter, it was good enough. We know all the silliness. But this is why Christians could

09:58.240 --> 10:06.320
are so easily victimized here is because they're reading Daniel nine, and it says Messiah,

10:06.320 --> 10:15.760
capital on M, and it gets worse. The word the Hebrew is Messiah, what the King James does,

10:15.760 --> 10:22.400
they amp it up, and they put in the definite article, the Messiah. There is no definite

10:22.400 --> 10:26.960
article in the Hebrew. So therefore, when you're reading a Christian Bible, you're reading a

10:26.960 --> 10:33.440
commentary, you're reading a human iteration. And this is not just any translate, any translation

10:33.440 --> 10:39.040
is a human commentary. But in the case of the Christian Bibles, and the fundamentals Christian

10:39.040 --> 10:45.280
Bibles, you're reading a corruption. And I just for a moment, just so you know, I want to tip my

10:45.280 --> 10:51.680
hat to the normal Christians, the mainline Christians, the revised standard version,

10:51.680 --> 10:59.360
or the new revised standard version does not engage in this idiotic process. They they're

10:59.360 --> 11:04.080
straight ahead on this. And by the way, the King James only people who was the tribe I came from,

11:04.720 --> 11:09.600
they thought these were demonic Bibles, because they were correct. They think that

11:09.600 --> 11:13.760
Satan corrupted these Bibles. And I used to I used to go along with this. This is what the

11:13.760 --> 11:18.400
pastor would tell me. Oh, Paul, watch your NIV. Look, it says in anointed, and it's not even in

11:18.400 --> 11:24.160
capital. It's the anointed, look at your King James. See, they changed it. And then I did the

11:24.160 --> 11:28.480
courageous thing, the thing that you're not supposed to do. So I went online and looked up the Hebrew,

11:28.480 --> 11:32.720
looked up the the manuscripts, looked up the Septuagint, and let's try to check them all up.

11:32.720 --> 11:38.240
So I had to compare them all, found out that there is no the there's no capital M. It's

11:38.240 --> 11:43.200
in anointed. It's somebody who's somebody who's anointed as a priest.

11:45.520 --> 11:51.040
This is going to gloom very large here. And you know, I'm going to say this to you, I can't think

11:51.040 --> 11:57.440
of another theological conversation. Well, what we're about, what I'm about to share with you is

11:57.440 --> 12:05.440
going to come up. So it actually when people say they only follow the King James, the King James

12:05.440 --> 12:12.720
only people. So most people see that as completely insane. The King James was commissioned this

12:12.720 --> 12:21.760
translation 1607. 47 people ultimately completed in 1611. And people really think today that when

12:21.760 --> 12:28.400
they're reading a King James Bible, that they're reading the 1611. If you had a 1611, which you

12:28.560 --> 12:36.800
can buy online. There is a 400 changes done from 1611 to like 1807 or something like that.

12:36.800 --> 12:42.080
Right. And then there's another massive and that's because the language changes. Right.

12:42.080 --> 12:50.080
Grammar. I mean, when in 1607, the the English is called the Jacobean English, you can make it out.

12:50.080 --> 12:56.000
But it's it's Jacobean English. It's not sure, sir. It's readable. But it's definitely not our

12:56.000 --> 13:01.200
King James. So the King James has gone through numerous revisions, because grammar is updated,

13:01.200 --> 13:08.400
words are updated, the colon semicolon just came into fashion. I mean, think of it this way,

13:09.120 --> 13:15.120
the King James version was published just a dozen years after Shakespeare published The

13:15.120 --> 13:20.880
Merchant of Endless. Okay, this is really going back in time. So it's been so like which King

13:20.880 --> 13:26.880
James are you referring to? Now you might think you the viewer might think that I'm just sort of

13:26.880 --> 13:32.560
sort of poking something at people who are King James only, I wouldn't waste my time with this,

13:32.560 --> 13:39.040
but this is going to become humongous in just a moment. So what Christians are saying is that look,

13:39.920 --> 13:48.480
there are 70 weeks that are decreed upon the people and the holy city, and then six things

13:48.480 --> 13:53.920
to terminate transgression and sin to wipe away iniquity, to bring everlasting righteous and

13:53.920 --> 14:01.680
to seal the vision of profit, and to anoint the most holy six things. Okay, and no one comprehend

14:01.680 --> 14:07.760
now in a King James Bible, it'll it'll read that from the going forth the commandment to restore

14:07.760 --> 14:15.440
and to build Jerusalem, until the Messiah, capital M, the Prince, capital P, it's insanity,

14:15.920 --> 14:22.960
shall be seven weeks, and three scorned two weeks, which means 62 weeks, how much seven,

14:22.960 --> 14:29.680
60 and two, 69 weeks. And therefore, and what will happen then, the streets will be rebuilt,

14:29.680 --> 14:37.760
straight and mowed, but in fabulous times, verse 26, after the 62 weeks shall Messiah,

14:37.760 --> 14:43.360
the Messiah be cut off, but not for himself. Okay, so they're saying here we have a clear

14:43.360 --> 14:53.360
prediction of Christ crucified when Paul preached. Now let's go back. And I think the key question

14:55.120 --> 15:01.760
to ask a Christian, I've done this in many live debates that on YouTube where I've asked the

15:01.760 --> 15:09.680
Christian like, what is your calculation? When do you start counting these 490 years?

15:09.760 --> 15:16.880
Like, and Christians just have no idea. That's the key. I've stood in huge audiences,

15:17.600 --> 15:23.520
all over the world. And when Christians ask me about Daniel nine, I've always asked the simple

15:23.520 --> 15:32.640
question, if there's a 490 year period, or a 483 period, a year period, because there's 69 weeks,

15:32.640 --> 15:40.560
at when do you start counting? And why do you start counting them? And Christians just completely

15:40.560 --> 15:45.920
shut down. They have no idea. They're not bad people. They're just never taught this. The pastors

15:45.920 --> 15:53.760
are not evil. Their pastors have no clue. So what we're going to do is we're going to actually unpack

15:53.760 --> 15:59.280
what's happening here. Because there's one other thing that Christians don't know. We've gone

15:59.360 --> 16:04.560
through this before. When we've talked about Isaiah 714, ask a Christian, what does it say

16:04.560 --> 16:11.280
in Isaiah 713? What is the context? When you read Isaiah 53, what does it say in Isaiah 52?

16:11.280 --> 16:18.400
And Christians just go, the lights go out. So what is happening here in Daniel nine?

16:18.400 --> 16:27.440
Daniel is an extraordinary predicament. Here's a prophet that is standing. This is how Daniel

16:27.440 --> 16:36.560
nine begins in the first year of Darius the meat. Why is that significant? If you don't know why

16:36.560 --> 16:47.760
that's meaningful, you can pack up and go home. What does that mean? Why is there is a prayer?

16:47.760 --> 16:54.640
Daniel is crying to God. He feels like the Jewish people are in an enormous amount of trouble. And

16:54.640 --> 17:04.240
you have no idea how serious the problem that Daniel's confronting Daniel. And I'm just unpacking

17:04.240 --> 17:12.240
Daniel chapter nine verse one and two. Daniel is standing at a time when the Babylonian empire

17:12.240 --> 17:19.760
has just collapsed. Historians to this day are hard pressed to explain how this could have happened.

17:19.760 --> 17:26.080
We talk about Babylonian Empire. You think about the United States. This was a massive empire.

17:26.080 --> 17:33.600
Like how did it collapse? And the Persian Empire suddenly explodes into a massive empire. How did

17:33.600 --> 17:42.240
it happen to this day? Historians are hard pressed to explain how it could have happened. But Daniel

17:42.240 --> 17:47.600
is looking at two passages in Jeremiah. If you don't know this,

17:49.600 --> 17:56.240
you can possibly understand Daniel nine. The first passage is Jeremiah chapter 25 verse 12.

17:56.960 --> 18:06.080
It's a passage that looks very similar to Daniel chapter 29 verse 10. Because both of them talk

18:06.080 --> 18:12.960
about a redemption of the Jewish people full of Babylon and they seem to be predicting the same

18:12.960 --> 18:21.760
exact thing. Daniel chapter 25 verse 12. Jeremiah is speaking and he's conveying that the Babylonian

18:21.760 --> 18:32.160
empire will collapse after 70 years. The audience needs to understand this because if you don't

18:32.160 --> 18:39.120
understand what's going on in this passage, Jeremiah is trying to convince the Jewish people

18:39.120 --> 18:46.000
not to rebel against Babylon. That's a huge part of the book of Jeremiah. People are saying let's

18:46.000 --> 18:52.800
fight against the Babylonians. And Jeremiah is saying God is not on your side. And if you do fight

18:52.800 --> 18:59.120
against Babylon, God is not going to be with you. And in fact, they didn't listen to Jeremiah.

18:59.760 --> 19:07.600
And moreover, Jeremiah says, the Babylonian empire only has 70 years. So if you just shut up

19:07.600 --> 19:13.360
and wait it out, they're going to be gone. That's the message of Jeremiah 25 verse 12. And that's

19:13.360 --> 19:20.560
the context. There is another passage which I'll read to you in the Jeremiah 29 verse 10. This is

19:20.560 --> 19:29.440
what Daniel is struggling with in that opening passage of Daniel 9. In Jeremiah 29 10, it says,

19:29.440 --> 19:36.640
the bus sayeth the Lord, at the completion of 70 years of Babylon, I will remember you. I will

19:36.640 --> 19:46.000
fill my good word toward you to restore you to this place. It seems identical. So imagine

19:46.000 --> 19:54.240
Daniel is standing there. The unthinkable, the Soviet Union, a massive empire collapses.

19:54.240 --> 20:01.680
The Babylonian empire, your nemesis collapses. But nothing's happening. The Jews are not going

20:01.680 --> 20:07.920
back. Darius, the meat has emerged. That means the Persian empire has begun. Right. And nothing is

20:07.920 --> 20:18.080
the Jews are not going back. And Daniel is going, oh my Lord, this is ominous. Daniel begins to think,

20:18.080 --> 20:27.600
and this is in the text in Daniel 9, begins to imagine that, whoa, the curse of Leviticus chapter

20:27.600 --> 20:34.720
26 verse 18, which says, if you sin against me and continue sin, I'll multiply your punishment

20:34.720 --> 20:42.080
seven times has emerged. And in fact, instead of a 70 year exile, there's perhaps a 490 year

20:42.080 --> 20:48.400
exile. And that's what he's struggling with. The angel Gabriel comes to explain to Daniel what is

20:48.400 --> 20:56.400
actually happening here. I need one other short history lesson. It's fascinating. I love it. Okay,

20:56.400 --> 21:03.440
so I need you the viewer to listen like you've never listened in your life. This is a critical

21:03.520 --> 21:10.320
history lesson. We're talking about Solomon's temple that stood for 410 years.

21:11.120 --> 21:18.960
History lesson, you must understand or you can't approach this text. 19 years prior to the

21:18.960 --> 21:24.800
destruction of the first temple, the Vuchad Netser and the Babylonian empire emerge.

21:25.200 --> 21:34.480
Power, a massive empire emerge, changes everything. Okay, so that's 19 years prior to

21:34.480 --> 21:41.200
destruction of the first temple. In the very next year, which is now 18 years before the

21:41.200 --> 21:46.320
destruction of the first temple, the Vuchad Netser, who's called Nebuchadnezzar, I think in the

21:47.280 --> 21:56.720
English-sized version, Nebuchadnezzar invades the land of Israel and he subjugates Jerusalem,

21:56.720 --> 22:03.680
which means the land of Israel becomes a vassal state of the Babylonian empire. Very critical.

22:04.800 --> 22:12.080
Nebuchadnezzar then will seek to extract. He doesn't want to destroy a temple at that point. He

22:12.080 --> 22:18.800
doesn't want to do any of those things. He just wants the Jews to give taxes to him and be loyal to

22:18.800 --> 22:25.120
him and give up on any idea of rebellion. These kings usually, they're not like Nazis. They just

22:25.120 --> 22:31.920
wanted to kill. This is no genocide. He just wanted the Jews to say, for them to say, okay,

22:31.920 --> 22:37.600
we surrender and we are now going to look like the Russians in Ukraine. Just surrender, say,

22:37.600 --> 22:44.880
take it over and you're now under the Russian empire. It's the same exact idea. The Jews don't

22:44.880 --> 22:51.360
want to listen to Nebuchadnezzar as any people, they would fight for their independence and Nebuchadnezzar

22:51.360 --> 22:58.800
then begins waves of expulsion of Jews, multiple ways of expulsion of Jewish people. During these

22:58.800 --> 23:06.320
18 years and the Jews continue to rebel, Jeremiah pleads with them, don't rebel, but bear this in

23:06.320 --> 23:14.800
mind. From 18 years prior to destruction of the first temple, Jerusalem already is a vassal state

23:14.800 --> 23:23.520
of the Babylonian empire. There is no independence any longer. Now listen carefully. In the 19th

23:23.520 --> 23:31.360
year from the Babylonian empire, the first temple is totally destroyed and almost all the Jews are

23:31.360 --> 23:38.160
exiled to Babylon. A small number goes to Egypt, but that's not germane right now. The first temple,

23:38.160 --> 23:45.120
Solomon's temple, is utterly destroyed by the Babylonian empire. Here's one other key element,

23:45.120 --> 23:54.560
a date you must know. For 50 years from the time the first temple was destroyed, until the Persian

23:54.560 --> 24:00.000
empire emerges, which means Darius the Mead, a very brief interlude, but then Cyrus the Great

24:00.800 --> 24:08.160
is 50 years, a 50-year period spans from the destruction of the first temple until

24:09.120 --> 24:14.800
the emergence of the Persian empire with Cyrus, who God calls his Messiah. I'm giving you a wink,

24:14.800 --> 24:21.440
I'm giving you a hint of what's going on there. Back in Isaiah 45 says that Cyrus, who was a king,

24:21.440 --> 24:29.920
who was an anointed prince, literally in Isaiah 45, Cyrus gives the command for the Jews to return

24:29.920 --> 24:39.120
back to Jerusalem and to rebuild it. Okay, so therefore, here's the key. If you're Daniel

24:39.920 --> 24:46.320
and you're standing at when the Babylonian empire is classed, but the Jews have not returning

24:46.320 --> 24:55.360
because Darius the Mead, you're counting 70 years from when? 70 years from the emergence of the

24:55.360 --> 25:02.560
Babylonian empire, which means you just passed the 69th year, and you're going, okay, one part of

25:02.560 --> 25:09.200
this prophecy has been fulfilled, but we're not going back. It's like you can hear crickets in

25:09.200 --> 25:17.360
the background, like what's going on? Like part one of prophecy is fulfilled, a part two isn't

25:17.360 --> 25:25.280
fulfilled. The angel Gabriel is there to explain to Daniel that in fact these two 70-year periods

25:25.280 --> 25:31.840
of Jeremiah 25, verse 12, and 29, verse 10 are two different 70-year periods because

25:31.840 --> 25:37.680
the Babylonian exile, that means for the time the first temple was destroyed until the second

25:37.680 --> 25:44.800
temple was built under the leadership of Zubaval and Yushua, Ben-Yo, and so on, that's 70 years.

25:44.800 --> 25:51.600
So therefore, there are two 70-year periods that overlap with each other and the overlap is 50 years,

25:51.600 --> 25:57.440
and now we can understand what's happening. So Daniel was pouring out his guts and going,

25:57.440 --> 26:04.400
please Lord, have mercy on us. Let us go back to our land. Let not this terrible curse come upon us

26:04.480 --> 26:12.400
articulated in Leviticus chapter 26, verse 19. So the text actually reads, you should know and

26:12.400 --> 26:20.400
understand, I'm going now to Daniel chapter 25, verse, chapter 9, verse 25, you should know and

26:20.400 --> 26:25.040
understand from the going forth of the word. What does that mean from the going forth of the word?

26:25.040 --> 26:30.720
We know that from Daniel chapter 9, verse 1 and 2, that means from the destruction of Jerusalem

26:30.720 --> 26:38.880
to return and rebuild Jerusalem until an anointed prince, the Hebrew is ad-meshiach-nogid,

26:39.600 --> 26:46.800
will be shavuim shiva, seven weeks. How long is seven weeks? Remember what I told you, each

26:46.800 --> 26:52.960
day is a year. I'm not going to go into why there's a reason why each day is a year in this,

26:52.960 --> 26:58.960
in Daniel 9, it's not the only place. It's very similar to Leviticus chapter 25. If you know what

26:58.960 --> 27:06.240
that means, great. If not, I don't want to overload you with information. Seven weeks, which means 49

27:06.240 --> 27:14.640
years will pass from the destruction of the first temple until an anointed prince, ad-meshiach-nogid.

27:15.600 --> 27:20.880
Seven weeks, that's 49 years. Remember what I told you, from the destruction of the first

27:20.880 --> 27:27.120
temple until Cyrus gives the command, see the opening passages of Ezra. This is why the

27:27.200 --> 27:32.320
Christian Bibles take the book of Ezra and they shove it away from the end of it because they

27:32.320 --> 27:37.200
don't want you to see it. That's why they mix up the order. They mix it up. Right, right, right.

27:37.200 --> 27:42.720
In the Jewish Bible, after you finish Daniel, go to Ezra. That's a nightmare for the church because

27:42.720 --> 27:47.600
if you finish Daniel, remember Daniel is only 12 chapters, and then you open up Ezra. What does

27:47.600 --> 27:54.640
Ezra begin with? The book of Ezra begins not with Ezra. My friends, boys and girls, in the book of

27:54.640 --> 28:01.840
Ezra, we're not introduced to Ezra until chapter seven. Ezra begins chapter one, verse one, two,

28:01.840 --> 28:08.560
three, four, five, in a pronouncement of Cyrus the Great saying, Jews, I have a word from God.

28:08.560 --> 28:14.800
You need to go back and rebuild Jerusalem. You've got to rebuild your temple, and I have it on word

28:14.800 --> 28:20.880
from God. Why is Cyrus saying that? Because he has a 200-year-old prophecy from Isaiah. And he

28:20.880 --> 28:26.480
says, I have it on God, that I've got to send you back. So therefore, what it says there is from the

28:26.480 --> 28:33.600
going forth of the word, the word is the word of prophecy, of Lechervot Jerusalem, see Daniel nine,

28:33.600 --> 28:39.920
verse one and two, from the destruction of the first temple until Cyrus the Great. Who is Cyrus

28:39.920 --> 28:44.880
the Great? He is at anointing. He's not just anointed, but he's a prince. Now, how do you know I'm

28:44.880 --> 28:51.440
telling you the truth? My friends, all you have to do is go to Isaiah chapter 44, verse 28,

28:51.440 --> 28:56.720
and Isaiah 45, verse one. That's where the chapter break is. That chapter break is completely

28:56.720 --> 29:04.640
artificial. Who says to Cyrus, Isaiah 44, verse 28, he is my shepherd, all my desire will be

29:04.640 --> 29:11.680
fulfilled in him. To say to Jerusalem, it shall be built and the temple shall be founded. So says the

29:11.680 --> 29:21.200
Lord, I want to say that again, and you can open up your King James Christy Bible with 15

29:21.200 --> 29:27.120
crosses on it. It doesn't make a difference which one you use. It will say, to my anointed,

29:27.120 --> 29:36.320
to Cyrus, the Hebrew is Messiah. And interestingly, my friends, take a guess before you look it up.

29:36.480 --> 29:47.680
In Isaiah 45, the exact same Hebrew word, Messiah, the Messiah, to his anointed, do you think in a

29:47.680 --> 29:55.920
King, based on what I've told you, in Isaiah 45, verse one, do you think that the word anointed

29:55.920 --> 30:05.040
is capitalized or not capitalized? In the King James? In the anything, in Jesus Christ? Right,

30:05.120 --> 30:14.560
in the Christ Jesus Christ, Mary, Mother of God. Yeah, which it shouldn't be. Which is it? It's the

30:14.560 --> 30:20.320
same Hebrew word. Why are you doing, why are you messing with you? You're right. That's exactly

30:20.320 --> 30:26.080
true. They're messing with the text. You Christians, I say this with love, you need to go back to

30:26.080 --> 30:33.520
church and demand a refund. You need to pull your kid. You're being lied to. You mean, you need to

30:33.520 --> 30:41.760
ask your pastor, why does the exact same Hebrew word, which appears in Isaiah 45, is translated as

30:41.760 --> 30:49.440
anointed with no capital A? And why don't you translate as Messiah in Isaiah 45, verse one?

30:49.440 --> 30:55.360
Listen, listen, listen. Yeah, please, please, please. If you doubt what I'm saying,

30:56.320 --> 31:04.400
ask your pastor, ask any Christian apologists, why does the King James Bible? Why does the King

31:04.400 --> 31:13.520
James translate the word Messiah in Isaiah 41, five, as anointed? But some, for some reason,

31:14.400 --> 31:21.120
in Daniel nine, as Messiah, like, what are you doing? It's the same Hebrew word. Could you explain

31:21.120 --> 31:26.960
that? Because if you can't explain it, I'm out. If you can't explain it, I put a lot of money in

31:26.960 --> 31:31.520
that plate they pass around, and I'm out of here, and I'm leaving skid marks, and I'm pulling my

31:31.520 --> 31:35.760
kids out of this Christian school. And I'm gonna start teaching my kids Hebrew. That is another

31:35.760 --> 31:42.800
prime example of somebody taking the word batula and changing it into, or I'm sorry,

31:42.800 --> 31:48.000
Alma and making that virgin, but then in other places in the text where the same word is used,

31:48.000 --> 31:53.760
they don't use that. So they're doing the they're doing it again. They're finding somewhere in the

31:53.760 --> 31:59.520
Bible in the Old Testament, where they need to emphasize certain words that have to be Christ

31:59.520 --> 32:04.960
like, capital M Messiah, but the same words used earlier in the in a different book,

32:05.760 --> 32:11.920
to describe the same person. Isaiah and Daniel talking about the same person. And it's capital,

32:11.920 --> 32:16.880
it's lowercase a anointed. It's the same word. Messiah is anointed. That's the same word. It's

32:16.880 --> 32:23.280
the Christ. In Greek, in Greek, it should say Christ, the Christian one. Right. I mean, although

32:23.280 --> 32:30.800
we have, right, that means why are you deliberately translating the exact same word in one you're

32:30.800 --> 32:36.640
rendering as them and you put the stuff the definite article there stuff a capital letter

32:36.640 --> 32:43.840
there. Just please don't let let don't please don't let your pastor or priest or Christian

32:43.920 --> 32:49.280
upon whoever it is. Don't let them like, change, don't let them change the topic. Okay, you got

32:49.280 --> 32:54.720
to try. I need an answer. And if you don't get a satisfying answer, I think it's time for you

32:54.720 --> 33:01.040
just to consider what's happening to you. This is why I care. Because I know if I grew up in a

33:01.040 --> 33:06.640
Christian home, I don't know if I'd figure this thing out. I don't know. Because I wasn't, if I

33:06.640 --> 33:11.200
was grew up in a Christian home in Oklahoma, I wouldn't be taught biblical Hebrew. If I was

33:11.200 --> 33:15.680
brought up in a Christian home in Kansas, they don't teach Kansas a pretty conservative a lot

33:15.680 --> 33:21.200
of evangelicals there. None of their schools for nine year olds are taught Hebrew. When I was nine

33:21.200 --> 33:26.000
years old, I could read Hebrew like you read a newspaper. I mean, it's not I'm wasn't just

33:26.000 --> 33:32.720
a spectacular student. I was very average. Any orthodox kid, they learned we learned Hebrew.

33:32.720 --> 33:36.480
I mean, we're just reading it straight through. And it's really easy. It's a small language.

33:37.040 --> 33:43.840
It gets crazier than this. First, what I'm going to do is I'm going to give you the final answer

33:43.840 --> 33:49.680
first. And then we're going to back up. There are two anointed ones spoken here in these passages

33:49.680 --> 33:56.080
at the end of Daniel nine. There's one anointed one who comes after seven weeks, which means after

33:56.080 --> 34:02.720
49 years, namely that Cyrus, how do you know? Because Tove says it forget Tovia. Look at Isaiah

34:02.800 --> 34:09.520
45 verse one, Cyrus is God's Messiah, God's Messiah. It says it explicitly. And then there's a

34:09.520 --> 34:16.880
subsequent anointed one who was cut off. He's not called the prince anymore after 62 weeks. Now,

34:16.880 --> 34:22.640
I'm going to give you the answer now. And then we can backpedal this. The distance from the

34:22.640 --> 34:28.880
destruction of the first time or destruction of the second temple is 490 years, 70 year exile,

34:28.960 --> 34:37.520
420 for the for the length of the second temple period. When do listen very carefully? When

34:37.520 --> 34:43.040
does the priesthood get cut off and the temple gets shut down? Let me at the end of the second

34:43.040 --> 34:49.440
temple period, when the Jews go to war with Rome, when does the war with Rome commence?

34:50.240 --> 34:59.680
64, 66, 66, which is how long? It's a half a week from 66 to 70 is how long? It's three and a half

34:59.680 --> 35:08.560
years, right bingo. There is your half a week. So what have this is mind blowing? I mean, your

35:08.560 --> 35:12.640
frontal lobe should be shooting through your cerebellum. And I don't even know what I just said.

35:13.600 --> 35:19.760
So in 66, what happens? The Jews go to war with Rome. It's a horrible, bloody war.

35:20.320 --> 35:25.600
Temple is surrounded. I, I'm a priest. That means I'm a direct descendant of Aaron,

35:25.600 --> 35:32.160
my father, father, father, going back today to see you understand this, although there are many

35:32.160 --> 35:38.240
rules that govern my life that is distinct from other Jewish people. As an example,

35:38.240 --> 35:41.840
I can't come into contact with a dead person. It's forbidden to think.

35:43.600 --> 35:50.160
There are rules that apply to me. But I can't bring sacrifices. I can't work in the temple

35:50.160 --> 35:55.520
because there is no temple. That means when the Jews go to war with Rome, the whole temple gets

35:55.520 --> 36:00.960
shut down, everything becomes isolated. It becomes a no, instead of a no flies on it becomes a no

36:00.960 --> 36:06.160
sacrifice zone. So then an anointed one is cut off. That's the priesthood. That means there are

36:06.160 --> 36:13.760
130 commandments in a Torah at a 613 associated with sacrifices bingo. That's cut off. The word

36:13.760 --> 36:20.960
he carries, Mashiach means an anointed one means carries doesn't mean killed. Now it could be if

36:20.960 --> 36:25.760
someone's cut off or it could be removed. It could be the kill, but it doesn't mean there are many

36:25.760 --> 36:31.840
ways you could say you're hurrying Mashiach. That's how you would say a Messiah is, is killed.

36:32.720 --> 36:38.560
Car race is removed. The literally the the root of the word means removed. Now how to,

36:38.560 --> 36:46.000
what does the Christian do with this? Because they want only one Messiah. And what they do,

36:46.000 --> 36:51.040
this tiny complicated, my apologies to you beforehand, but you need to know these numbers,

36:51.040 --> 36:57.680
or you'll never understand Daniel 9. Daniel 9 is describing two anointed ones, one that comes

36:57.680 --> 37:05.120
after 549 years after seven weeks. And that's Cyrus and a second subsequent anointed one. But

37:05.120 --> 37:13.760
he's not a prince. He's not Cyrus. He's coming. He's coming 62 weeks later, which is 434 years.

37:13.760 --> 37:20.720
That's three and a half years before the destruction of the second temple. And he is removed. The

37:20.720 --> 37:26.400
church hates this. They need to have both anointed ones are the same. And this is where it gets

37:26.400 --> 37:31.680
interesting. So if you're looking at a Christian model, whatever, it's going to make it appear as

37:31.680 --> 37:40.320
though the period of time is 760 and two. So the text is going to read the Messiah, the prince in

37:40.320 --> 37:46.080
a King James shall be from going forth of the commandment to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem

37:46.080 --> 37:54.800
until the Messiah, the prince shall be seven weeks comma and three score and two weeks,

37:54.800 --> 38:01.840
which means 62 weeks. That means it sounds like the text is saying 69 weeks, but it's breaking

38:01.840 --> 38:07.440
it up into a weird way. That means it puts a comma there, but there's no comma there. It should be a

38:07.440 --> 38:13.200
complete semicolon there. This is where the King James of vision is going to is going to blow your

38:13.200 --> 38:22.640
mind out the window. That means in any language, the way you say 69 is 69. It's not just English

38:23.120 --> 38:31.520
in French 69 in German nine in Zerchse. You never say you never say seven, two and 16.

38:31.520 --> 38:36.800
So what the church did was it compressed these two. It really is saying after 17 weeks, I'll

38:36.800 --> 38:44.560
translate after 49 weeks, we have Cyrus. And if there is subsequent 434 years, you have an anointed

38:44.560 --> 38:50.000
one, which is the priesthood cut off, but they have to conflate it. So they remove the semicolon

38:50.000 --> 38:56.160
and they put they put in a comma. Now here is the craziness. I don't think you have it. But if you

38:56.160 --> 39:01.440
have it, I'd be blown away impressed. We don't prepare for our shows. So we just we just wing it.

39:03.040 --> 39:11.040
If you had an actual King James from the 1611 and I discuss this extensively in volume one,

39:11.040 --> 39:19.280
let's get biblical and I have a picture. I have the 1611 1616 11 King James. If you had a I don't

39:19.280 --> 39:25.120
know if you could do this online or whatever. I don't have the 18 for 1800 version. But I had

39:25.120 --> 39:32.000
that I could get it online. If you could one you could pull it up online the actual 1611.

39:32.800 --> 39:41.280
Daniel nine verse 25. Right in the 1611 King James, not in the 19th century King James,

39:41.280 --> 39:48.320
not in 18th century King James, but the original 1611 in 1911 they actually pulled out the plates

39:48.880 --> 39:54.880
and republished it. Yeah, this Bible is not any all the King James only churches do not use this

39:54.880 --> 39:59.520
Bible anymore. It's not right. Not even readable. But do you want me to read it? It's beer. It's

39:59.520 --> 40:04.720
barely readable. But this is the mindblower. I'll show it on the screen while reading it too. So

40:04.720 --> 40:11.760
they can see the grammar and everything. Okay. Verse 25 says know therefore and understand with

40:11.760 --> 40:18.960
a V that from going forth of the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem unto the Messiah,

40:18.960 --> 40:23.760
the prince shall be suing weeks seven weeks and three score and stop stop right there.

40:23.760 --> 40:29.920
All right. Stop right there. What happens after seven weeks? Forget the crazy spelling that it's

40:29.920 --> 40:35.280
you instead of you score and what do you see there? Three score in two weeks. Before three

40:35.280 --> 40:44.560
scores, there is an unambiguous grammatical notation. It's an esnach in Hebrew. And what is it

40:44.560 --> 40:52.160
in the in the grammar there? There's a semicolon. Do you see that? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Thank you. There's

40:52.160 --> 40:59.680
a semicolon, which means it's a stop full blown stop. So from the going forth the word, listen,

40:59.680 --> 41:03.440
my friends, like you've never from the going forth the word, which means from the

41:04.160 --> 41:11.040
slime, go back to Daniel 9 verse one and two from the destruction of the first temple until

41:11.680 --> 41:18.480
an anointed one, a prince, the Messiah, the prince of the King James Translate will be seven weeks

41:19.600 --> 41:27.040
stop. There's a semicolon there. Because in 1611, they didn't come up with this whole deal.

41:27.040 --> 41:31.200
Now they wonder you think that's talking about Jesus because that already goes back

41:31.200 --> 41:35.680
to the second surgery, but they never thought of compressing the two periods. Now,

41:35.680 --> 41:42.800
here's what I want you to do. I want you to open up a modern King James. That means not the 1611.

41:42.800 --> 41:51.280
Let's go to the one that was just published yesterday. Okay, and notice. Wow. Thank you.

41:51.280 --> 41:59.840
Seven weeks, comma, no semicolon. Right. The same. See what happened is crazy, crazy, crazy.

41:59.840 --> 42:05.280
That means, and just think about this for a moment. In what universe do you say 69 by saying

42:05.280 --> 42:13.200
762? That's, that's ridiculous. And to prove it further, look at Daniel 9 verse 26, the next

42:13.200 --> 42:18.720
path. Just so you want to make sure that Rabbi Singer is not some fanatic who hates Christianity

42:18.720 --> 42:24.720
and is coming on here in order to just make, just so you know for sure that Daniel is interested

42:24.720 --> 42:30.080
in this Gabriel speaking here that Daniel is interested in conveying a 62 week period.

42:30.080 --> 42:34.480
Look at verse 26. What does it say there? And after three score and two weeks shall

42:35.760 --> 42:42.640
it doesn't say after seven three score and two it says after three three score and two weeks after

42:42.640 --> 42:50.960
62 weeks 62 times seven is 434 bingo. So when I said to you at the beginning of the broadcast

42:50.960 --> 42:58.000
that this is going to make a humongous difference whether you're using a 1611 King James or 2022

42:58.000 --> 43:04.640
to King James, I wasn't exaggerating. So you need to ask the Christian, how do you play with this?

43:04.640 --> 43:10.400
And we have two anointed ones here. One after seven weeks, I mean 49 years, Cyrus the great.

43:10.400 --> 43:15.120
How do you know he's the Messiah? It says so and Isaiah 45 verse one. It's really,

43:15.120 --> 43:20.000
really famous. By the way, we've talked about this in the past. The people who were Trump supporters

43:20.000 --> 43:26.480
said Cyrus is a picture of Trump and and had the coin of Trump was was president number 45.

43:26.480 --> 43:33.120
I had that one actually. Yeah. So so there so that's how it's come. So there are two different

43:33.120 --> 43:38.480
anointed ones. What the church does is it tries to compress it. There are more problems here than

43:38.480 --> 43:45.680
you can imagine because as it turns out, if you say that the anointed one who's cut off is Jesus,

43:46.240 --> 43:51.680
crucified according to Christian tradition, either in the year 30 or the year 33. Well,

43:51.680 --> 43:57.120
that's not when the temple's destroyed. That means if let's say Jesus crucified the year 30,

43:58.080 --> 44:04.560
it's not a consensus, but let's say we'll say 30. So from 30 to 70, is that a half a week?

44:04.560 --> 44:11.360
What's the half a week? Like, what happened? It means from the time Jesus is executed by crucifixion

44:11.360 --> 44:18.320
in the year 30, until the destruction of Second Temple is 40 years, 40 years is five and a half

44:18.320 --> 44:26.000
weeks. It doesn't work. The whole thing completely collapses. Wow. Wow is right. So what happens is

44:26.000 --> 44:32.480
the whole thing doesn't work. Because remember, in it, look very careful at Daniel nine, verse 26,

44:32.480 --> 44:38.160
there's a prediction of the destruction, the people of the Prince will come, that's Rome,

44:38.160 --> 44:47.680
and they will destroy what? The city and the sanctuary. This is not, this is not like Antiochus

44:47.680 --> 44:54.240
Epiphanes. This is the destruction of the sanctuary. We know when that happened in the year 70.

44:54.240 --> 45:01.280
Yeah. Really? It doesn't work. Whereas if it's a half a week prior to destruction in Temple,

45:01.280 --> 45:06.320
that's the year 66. One point that's going to come up, people are going to ask this question,

45:06.320 --> 45:13.760
so I want to head it off. The chronology of Herodotus for the period of the Persian Empire,

45:13.760 --> 45:18.160
which means the length of the Second Temple, I don't want to get too advanced on this.

45:18.160 --> 45:26.400
And the Jewish chronology are very different here. Herodotus is the, he's either called the

45:26.400 --> 45:32.320
father of history, or as Xenophon fondly refers to him, and sister as the father of lies.

45:32.320 --> 45:40.240
Herodotus, if you read any, he does make up a lot of stuff. I'll give you an example. He says

45:40.240 --> 45:45.920
the people in the north are called the hyperborians, and they have one eye. They're like little,

45:45.920 --> 45:50.240
little tiny guys with one eyes on their forehead. And they have gold guarding griffins that fly

45:50.240 --> 45:56.960
around flying lines. And then he said that King Cyrus got killed for going up into the land of

45:56.960 --> 46:03.360
the Scythians and some throw chop his head off, but other historians not like what? That didn't

46:03.360 --> 46:12.080
happen. So yeah, that's just to give some examples. There are, this is, this is, it's a good

46:12.080 --> 46:20.640
geography stories referred to Herodotus as words, but just in completely insane. If you

46:20.640 --> 46:26.960
read it, you could pick any article on Herodotus, any encyclopedia you want. I'm making this up.

46:26.960 --> 46:33.920
I don't know this for sure, but I'm guessing within, I'm fairly confident within 75 words,

46:33.920 --> 46:40.880
it's going to talk about Herodotus's lies and all the problems around this. Just stuff, right.

46:41.440 --> 46:46.400
You one of his maps? He makes a map of the world as a little circle, right? It's like,

46:46.960 --> 46:51.040
just a little circle. It's like, right. There are places he said he's been where we know he

46:51.040 --> 46:56.160
hasn't been. There are whole dissertations been written, not one thousands of dissertations.

46:56.160 --> 47:02.640
He said the Arabian worship Dionysus. What? Right. I mean, it's, it's not that he made a

47:02.640 --> 47:09.120
mistake. I mean, this is the ancient world. No, no, no, he, so there's a fear that he was just

47:09.120 --> 47:13.760
bat nuts out of his mind and just made up stuff and he was lying through his teeth.

47:13.760 --> 47:20.800
Yeah, I mean, ours. Yeah. Yeah. So this is, so I want to explain this point. So there is a,

47:22.480 --> 47:28.880
there is a considerable difference between, and I write about this in less biblical volume one,

47:28.880 --> 47:33.600
there's a considerable difference of the Jewish chronology of the length of the Persian Empire

47:33.600 --> 47:40.240
and the secular chronology, which relies on Herodotus. We don't. So just so you understand

47:40.720 --> 47:47.120
this. So the period therefore of in some, the period that we're discussing here is a 490-year

47:47.120 --> 47:55.360
period, 70 plus 420. And the anointed one who's cut off is my great-great-grandfather, and that's

47:55.360 --> 48:01.280
the priesthood. The term cut off, not Yikari means cut off, removed. It could be killed.

48:01.280 --> 48:06.160
Doesn't mean that. If he wanted to say killed, it'll be Yahare would be killed. Doesn't say that

48:06.160 --> 48:11.920
at all. And that happens when a half a week, if you ask Christians, by the way, what do you do

48:11.920 --> 48:16.320
with the last week? They have no clue. If you ask the Christian, but wait, there's another week and

48:16.320 --> 48:20.960
then there's a half a week, when did that week happen? There's no answer. How is it that Jesus

48:20.960 --> 48:28.480
was crucified near 30, but the sanctuary is destroyed 40 years later, when you have a prophecy

48:28.480 --> 48:34.720
that happens immediately after, there is no possible answer. I'll tell you this, I did the

48:34.800 --> 48:42.000
forensics on this. I wanted to find out who started this, who made this, who

48:42.000 --> 48:48.320
came up with the idea, because as I mentioned at the outset, Daniel 9, this whole thing with

48:48.320 --> 48:52.160
the dating is not in the Christian Bible. They didn't think of this stuff. They didn't come up

48:52.160 --> 48:58.880
with this one. And it basically comes down to the time of Irenaeus, meaning basically late

48:58.880 --> 49:06.320
second century. Yeah, you could tell, yeah. Right. And, but it's funny because it almost

49:06.320 --> 49:13.760
makes you wonder if after, so after the temple's already destroyed, Paul writes his stuff, Paul

49:13.760 --> 49:17.520
doesn't do any of this stuff. He doesn't even get into the years or nothing. So you know that Paul

49:17.520 --> 49:22.080
is not talking about this or thinking about this, like you mentioned before. But it makes you wonder

49:22.160 --> 49:28.960
if going forward, the church or early Christians are looking back in the text

49:28.960 --> 49:34.000
and trying to plug these numbers in, because it's like, okay, Jesus, well, you know, the destruction

49:34.000 --> 49:38.240
of the temple is sort of close to what he was crucified, 40 years, give or take. Oh, he was

49:38.240 --> 49:42.480
probably born at the year one then, which wasn't the year one. I'm just saying that just so we

49:42.480 --> 49:47.680
can understand. The year one didn't happen for like, what, 700 years? What is it like?

49:47.680 --> 49:53.600
Way, way later. Anyways, but anyways, they're probably making these dates fit. And we don't

49:53.600 --> 49:59.360
even know when Jesus was born. If he was born in 4 BC, he had to have been at least born in 4 BC,

49:59.360 --> 50:04.160
because that's when Herod died. Matthew. Yeah, right. So like, have to be so the numbers are

50:04.160 --> 50:10.480
even less than two, right? Right. So Matthew, yeah, that's what I'm trying to get. Right, right.

50:10.480 --> 50:16.320
The guy who invented our year, that means like, we're in 2022, like, who came up with that? And

50:16.320 --> 50:22.400
when did people start using that? So it was a sixth century monk, his name was Danesius Exegius,

50:22.400 --> 50:28.320
which literally means Danny the dwarf. I have no idea how that happened. And that's what I'm,

50:28.320 --> 50:33.360
and that's what he was doing. He was trying to make the numbers fit to 70. Right, right, right,

50:33.360 --> 50:40.400
which he was close, but it just doesn't match. Just literally impossible. I don't envy him because

50:40.480 --> 50:48.800
as it turns out, as you know, Matthew Luke, date Jesus's birth of more than a decade apart,

50:48.800 --> 50:55.520
as you mentioned, Matthew has Jesus born, while Herod the Great is still alive. And Herod the

50:55.520 --> 51:00.720
Great is saying in Matthew's infancy narrative, that look at look, you know, kill all the kids

51:00.720 --> 51:09.120
who two years years older and younger. Therefore, six BC would be, I had a rabbi who once said,

51:09.120 --> 51:14.160
isn't it interesting that according to Matthew, Jesus was born six years before Christ? That's

51:14.160 --> 51:25.760
a whole different joke. It's so crazy. According to Luke, Jesus was born during the time that the

51:25.760 --> 51:33.200
governor of Syria took over from Herod Archelaus, Uranus, that's the year six C, we know that.

51:33.200 --> 51:39.920
So they're actually 11 years apart. There's no year zero. So, I mean, what was dynasty as you

51:39.920 --> 51:43.840
was going to come up with? I mean, this is sixth century. I mean, the lights went out in the sixth

51:43.840 --> 51:50.000
century. You know, kudos to you for trying to come up. He's basically trying to do a tation,

51:50.000 --> 51:55.200
you know, a diatesson where he's trying to merge everything together. It doesn't work. He tried

51:55.200 --> 51:59.440
his best. Yeah. And that's what I was just going to say. Like, it's one of those things that you

51:59.440 --> 52:05.760
look at and you're like, wow, they almost made that fit. They almost did. But it's like, but once

52:05.760 --> 52:10.080
you look at it, once you actually get to the numbers and you actually plug in the numbers,

52:10.080 --> 52:15.600
look at Matthew when he was born, when all this happened, you're like, no, it doesn't, it literally

52:15.600 --> 52:20.800
is impossible for this to fit. And then you would have to ask yourself this question. If it's so

52:20.800 --> 52:27.600
close, oh, it's so close. Well, we're talking about God here, is God going to be close? Is it going

52:27.600 --> 52:32.960
to be a couple of years off? Or is he going to be this is going to be right on? So you can't,

52:32.960 --> 52:37.920
it can't be that way. It's close enough. Come on, we're four years, three years here. No,

52:37.920 --> 52:45.200
it doesn't work that way. It's not, it's not right. It's not on. Right. So it's, I'm heating up your

52:45.200 --> 52:51.920
point. Well, it's not just a matter of how much time so 11 years, let's stop being so picky,

52:52.880 --> 53:02.240
it's two different periods. Herod the Great dies in four BC. His son, Herod Archelaus takes over

53:02.240 --> 53:11.120
and he governs over Judea. Herod, Herod the Great was insane. He was a maniac. His son was crazier

53:11.120 --> 53:16.800
than his dad. Yeah, was totally insane. That fits into Matthew where Joseph is born. Don't go back

53:16.800 --> 53:23.520
to Bethlehem. It's hard. Herod Archelaus was so crazy that he was too nuts and too anti-Jewish and

53:23.520 --> 53:28.720
too violent for the Romans and they fired. This is the very big point. So they were just the puppets

53:28.720 --> 53:33.280
of Augustus. Right. That means they're all puppets. These are not really the king of the Jews. They

53:33.280 --> 53:38.480
call themselves that. They all are answering to the emperor of Rome. But Paul, you know, as far as

53:38.480 --> 53:43.280
the emperor of Rome is going to call yourself what you want. I don't just pay the taxes and you're

53:43.280 --> 53:50.400
fine. That's what was going on. So Herod the Great dies in four BC. Herod Archelaus takes

53:50.400 --> 53:57.440
over the region called Judea, which essentially is everything south of Jerusalem. Herod Archelaus

53:57.440 --> 54:02.880
was a psychopath. Definitely inherited his father's craziness. There was no Haldol. There was no

54:02.880 --> 54:08.000
lithium at the time. And he went berserk and ultimately was a slaughter of Jews in the temple

54:08.000 --> 54:15.760
in the year six CE over a Passover massacre. The Romans go, you are crazy. I mean, imagine

54:15.760 --> 54:21.920
if you are so nuts that you're too crazy for the Romans. And the Romans says, Herod Archelaus,

54:21.920 --> 54:27.200
you're out and he's fired. This is like very well known. And then he brings in and he goes,

54:27.840 --> 54:31.760
let's take that Gentile from Syria, who's the governor there, Uranus,

54:31.760 --> 54:39.600
Uranus, and bring him in. And then he not only has Syria, but he also governs now over Judea.

54:39.600 --> 54:45.680
Okay, so we know when that happened. I mean, they can't be the same. That's six years. Right.

54:45.680 --> 54:50.880
Exactly. We know when all that happens. We have multiple sources on this. So this is not like,

54:50.880 --> 54:56.080
and of course, Matthew and Luke go in two different directions. Right. Luke has the family,

54:56.080 --> 55:01.920
you know, start off in Nazareth, and then go to Bethlehem because of the census. That's the

55:02.480 --> 55:07.360
plot device that Luke is using following the birth of Jesus. He's not born at home,

55:07.360 --> 55:12.800
as in Matthew. He's born in a manger because there's no room at the end. I just heard a Christian

55:12.800 --> 55:17.600
apologies. I'm not going to say who, but he's a fairly well known guy. He's say in a debate with

55:17.600 --> 55:24.560
a really well known non Christian New Testament scholar that the Mary and Joseph had two homes.

55:24.640 --> 55:29.680
I'm not, I'm not kidding. I'm not going to name me because I don't want to embarrass anyone. Yeah.

55:29.680 --> 55:33.120
Okay, so I need to say this because I don't know if anyone's going to say this.

55:34.320 --> 55:38.080
In, you need to know this because I just saw this in the debate that just occurred like a month

55:38.080 --> 55:44.960
ago. I'm not naming me because it doesn't interest me. So what happens is the non Christian New

55:44.960 --> 55:52.640
Testament scholar said correctly that Mary and Joseph in Luke's view, start off their home is

55:52.640 --> 56:00.080
in Nazareth. The census forces them to move to Bethlehem. Why? Because Joseph is a descendant

56:00.080 --> 56:08.560
of King David. Okay. Just look at Luke chapter one verse 27. Okay. It's really right there. Okay.

56:08.560 --> 56:15.520
Now they then after the child is born, and they then go back to Jerusalem drew just so you know

56:15.520 --> 56:22.400
if you draw a line from Nazareth to Bethlehem, it would basically pass through Jerusalem. The

56:22.400 --> 56:27.520
distance is not that far. Let's say it's 90 miles, something like that. Okay. So they, she then

56:27.520 --> 56:34.080
after the month period, she then brings the necessary offerings in the temple and then

56:34.080 --> 56:39.920
heads back home in Matthew. It's entirely reversed the families originally from Bethlehem.

56:39.920 --> 56:45.120
And then the family has to go down to Egypt and wait to death of Herod. And then Joseph is born.

56:45.120 --> 56:51.840
You can't go back home. Because the new guy Herod Archaeologists crazy and his dad, and therefore

56:51.840 --> 56:58.160
they go to Nazareth. I saw this in a debate with this Christian, who's an who's a knowledgeable guy,

56:58.160 --> 57:06.480
this Christian apologist answered this by saying that actually Mary and Joseph had two homes.

57:06.480 --> 57:14.080
They had one home in Nazareth and another home in Bethlehem. Okay. And I'm sorry that the non

57:14.080 --> 57:19.200
Christian didn't respond, but he should have responded. That's completely ridiculous. Why?

57:19.200 --> 57:25.520
Because see Luke chapter two verse seven. It says in Luke, remember, they don't have a home in

57:25.520 --> 57:31.600
they don't have a home in Luke. I'm giving this all the way. They don't have a home in Bethlehem.

57:31.600 --> 57:39.120
Joseph and Mary are from Nazareth. And there's no room at the hotel at the end. Right. Right.

57:39.360 --> 57:47.680
Jesus went in a manger. Right. Now, I don't, I don't, I was watching it and rooting and going,

57:47.680 --> 57:54.960
wait, there's a, they couldn't have had two homes. The whole point of Luke is that Jesus was born

57:54.960 --> 58:02.320
in the most distressed, the most humble place possible, a place where horses eat from a manger,

58:02.320 --> 58:10.080
a trough. And why Luke says, because there's no room at the end, there's no room at the hotel.

58:10.080 --> 58:17.120
But if, as the Christians say, that Mary and Joseph had two homes, one in the Galilee and one

58:17.120 --> 58:22.160
in Judea and Bethlehem, why would they have to give, why would they have to go into a barn to

58:22.160 --> 58:27.040
give birth? Why don't just give birth in your home? And I'm sorry that the non Christian didn't get

58:27.040 --> 58:31.840
that one. Yeah, that's, that's, that's very obvious. That's like, right. I'll be a brain

58:31.840 --> 58:37.200
scientist to figure that one out. Right. So in Bethlehem, notice, and therefore you can project

58:37.200 --> 58:44.240
from that. So Matthew, would we expect in the book of Matthew to have any mention of a manger?

58:44.240 --> 58:48.880
No, because their home is in Bethlehem. That's what they originally, that's a starting point.

58:48.880 --> 58:54.640
What's happening essentially is Matthew and Luke are independently inventing two different

58:54.720 --> 59:00.240
infancy narratives, or collecting an oral tradition of the infancy narrative in two different places

59:00.240 --> 59:06.480
and come up with two separate incompatible devices to get Jesus to be born in the city

59:06.480 --> 59:11.840
in which King David was born. King David was born in Bethlehem. See first Samuel, chapter 17,

59:11.840 --> 59:17.840
verse 58. So, but they independently come up with this. So this is an L source and an M source.

59:17.840 --> 59:21.200
And then the whole thing explodes, but it's too late to

59:21.200 --> 59:26.240
to rectify because you have, I mean, people think that like at the end of the first century,

59:26.240 --> 59:29.760
people had a Bible like we have together. No, there were certain communities that had the

59:29.760 --> 59:33.840
book of Luke, some communities that only had the book of Mark, and some only Matthew. By the time

59:33.840 --> 59:38.240
you get to the second century, it's too late. And by the time Irenaeus, the bishop of Leon,

59:38.240 --> 59:43.760
saying these are the four, that's it. It's all locked up. Isn't that crazy? Yeah.

59:44.960 --> 59:49.040
Yeah, that's, there's a lot. You just, I just learned a lot in this.

59:49.600 --> 59:54.880
Wasn't that intense? Yeah. Right. And it turns out I won't name names, but there are Christian

59:54.880 --> 01:00:00.480
evangelical scholars who to their credit can see that these are completely incompatible.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:06.240
Yep. Oh yeah, I've talked to those people. Yeah. And I don't want, but they're, they know this can't

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:11.920
work. Right. And therefore the entire, it's very obvious what's happening here, what's happening

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:17.680
in Daniel's mind is, is they already have an idea. And then there's a bias confirmation,

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:24.400
they want to have Daniel 9 predict the date of Jesus' crucifixion. They don't care how it's done.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:31.520
And then they go back, scour through texts, and then twist the passages, change the, the, the

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:38.720
anointed to capital M Messiah, put the definite article, it doesn't exist there. And then just

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:44.000
chop it up, take out the semicolon that's done somewhere between 1611. Now it's done in the

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.920
19th century, then the semicolon puff just disappears. There is the unambiguous of a

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:56.320
grammatical device called an Esnacht, which is there. And if you're going, well, the Esnacht

01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:01.200
was invented by the Messerites. I mean, it's a, it's a grammatical device. If you think that the

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:08.640
Messerite just made it up in what universe is 760 and two, the way you say 69. And in case you're

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:14.640
saying, I don't believe Rabbi Singer, just look at Daniel 9 verse 26. It says after the 62 weeks,

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:22.880
doesn't say after the 69 weeks bingo, dead, it's over. This is why Christians do not teach their

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:28.960
children the Hebrew language, despite the fact that Christians believe that the Hebrew language

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:36.960
was used to convey, convey eternal oracles. They can easily Christians could do exactly what the

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:43.760
Jewish people can do. And that is enough with the Latin and teach biblical Hebrew to young boys

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:50.320
and girls. They don't. If Christians could read the Jewish Bible in its original language, they'd

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:58.240
be leaving the church. Now Christians can study Hebrew as an adult. Go to college, take biblical,

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:02.400
it takes years. I mean, when you're an adult, language doesn't come to you. But it's too late,

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:06.640
you're already bought into the system. And then you're reading everything through a

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:11.440
Christologic grid and become really very difficult. But this is why, you know,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.880
Christian schools for kids, they're not teaching there. They're not teaching Hebrew to the kids.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:21.680
You want to take biblical Hebrew and full of theological Dallas Theological Buddha Bible

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:26.240
Institute, you're 19 or 20 years old. I mean, if you want to be pastor, I don't know how many

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:30.480
semesters you got to do a biblical Hebrew, you're not going to be able to barely make out a word.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:35.840
Right. You're done, you're smoked, you're fried, you have no chance at all. And then I think, you

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:42.160
know, you know, I think that's why the King James only that's where they get their traction

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:48.080
from what like why would anyone believe that, that folks from the Church of England,

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:52.640
that 47 men and good standing from the Church of England, that they would rightfully as divinely

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:58.640
inspired. And to their credit, even though, you know, it's easy to mock the idea,

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:06.400
because they don't have a holy language, the King James has come to replace their holy language,

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:13.200
right, because they have no access to the Hebrew. I mean, even if you think that a movement is insane,

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:19.520
like a King James only is sounds crazy, you do have to ask the question, but like, why is the

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:27.760
what is generating the 67 what is, what is the spark? And if they don't have access to a holy

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:34.160
language, then they then what happens then the, then the King James and the kind of Jacobian

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:40.320
English, it's not really anymore, but it's been cleaned up a lot. Yeah, it's that the King Val

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:46.880
art, so on. Verily, I sent you words that are, it gives people something that becomes the holy

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:52.240
language. Yes, that's what's really going on. It's Shakespeare, too. It's Shakespeare language.

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:57.440
And that's what's so funny about it. It's like, it become like you said, it's the archaic English

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:02.880
language. You know, when the King James was written, there were no Jews in England.

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:10.880
The Jews, there was not a single Jew in England in 1611. Wow. The Jews had been expelled centuries

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:19.040
early. There were no Jews there. None, not a Jew to be found in in England. Jews would not return

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:23.840
to England until 40 years after the death of Shakespeare. Shakespeare is alive and

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:29.520
during the time when the King James Bible is published. Yeah, as I said, just a dozen years

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:32.400
after the merchant, I mean, he's writing the Merchant of Venice, having never,

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:38.560
Shakespeare never met a Jew in his life, ever by the Calvin. He was part of the Kingsman,

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:43.440
which was a, right, who was funded by King James. It was in the same court and it had

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:49.360
Shakespeare and all the plays that you, all the plays that we know, all the Macbeth and all those

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:54.400
from like 1604 to 1610 around the same time they're writing the King James Bible. It's all

01:04:54.400 --> 01:05:01.520
happening in the same decade. I wanted to just submit one other thing for evangelicals to consider

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:09.360
this ponder about this. Evangelical Christians are not fond of the Church of the Latter-day Saints.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:14.640
They consider the Mormons to be a cult. I'm not making this up for those who are not familiar

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:20.960
with this. Oh yeah. If you ever refer to a Mormon, right, if you ever refer to a Mormon as a Christian

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:28.480
in the presence of an evangelical or a Roman Catholic, they'll say they are not Christians.

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:33.840
This is a, they're called a cult. They can't stand them, not personally, but theologically can't

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:39.440
stand them. You can call a Catholic a Christian in front of a Baptist and you can get away with

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:46.320
that, but you will never get away with calling a Mormon a Christian like Senator Orrin Hatch just

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:50.720
passed away. You know, they would never refer to him as a Christian because he was a Mormon. Okay.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:56.240
This is, I want you to listen very carefully. I've never said this publicly. If you ask an

01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:03.280
evangelical Christian, why don't you believe in the Church of the Latter-day Saints? What's wrong

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:09.200
with it? So they would give you a whole list of problems with it. They would say that it's in,

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:16.480
it's incompatible with the teachings of the New Testament, the Book of Mormon. They would say that

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:22.400
Joseph Smith is whatever, he was a, he was quite a prankster and so on, blah, blah, blah, whole

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:32.240
bunch of, but in that list, evangelical say to you that in the Book of Mormon, a ton of the Jewish

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:38.400
Bible is quoted. That means the Hebrew Bible is quoted all over the place. More than 20 chapters

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:44.080
of the Book of Isaiah appears in the Book of Mormon. And guess what? In the Book of Mormon,

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:50.960
which version of the Bible is used was revealed to Joseph Smith through the Angel Moroni, the

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:56.800
King James Version, the 1611 Version. And even evangelical Christians, well appealing to the

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:05.520
Christian, properly and correctly laugh and go, why would the Angel Moroni be quoting the 1611

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:11.840
Bible? Like did the angels forget Hebrew? Like why would the angels be quoting the 1611? I'm not

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:19.440
making, so this is like a big deal because all over the Book of Mormon, huge swaths of passages

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:26.800
all over the Jewish Bible is quoted and it's straight King James, King James 1611. And evangelicals,

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:32.000
this is why I appeal to the evangelical, use that critical thinking when you start quoting

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:38.960
Septuagint. Use that critical thinking when you start quoting King James. I mean, if you understand

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:46.160
that the Book of Mormon is a book that does not deserve your respect, attention, should not be

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:52.800
you should not be relied upon, is not credible for many reasons, including that it's using the

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:59.040
King James Version, then apply that in the same angle. Holy moly. Why would I think that the

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:03.920
Writers of the Testament are relying on the Septuagint? Right. Just like wake up and people

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:09.440
don't think about such a good point. Yeah, right. Like, like, you reject, you're rejecting all these

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:15.840
other iterations of Christianity, then use the same critical thinking and apply it to what you

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:23.280
belong to apply it to your iteration of Christian ago. What? I mean, the Holy Spirit was using the

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:31.200
Septuagint to inform Matthew how to write Matthew 123, really like God, the Holy Spirit, the third

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:37.200
person of the Trinity, just forgot how to read Hebrew and decided to be reading from a translation.

01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:45.600
Does that make sense to anyone? This is clearly written for a different purpose,

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:53.040
and it's being repurposed by Christians, tweaked, even changed and altered in some areas,

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:59.360
for example, capitalizing letters and changing stuff. And you can see clearly that it just

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:05.040
doesn't match. Like, do the check the numbers, the numbers don't match up. But for what you

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:08.720
were saying in the beginning, it does match up, where you talk about the temple actually

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:14.160
being destroyed, and the priesthood being cut down. That's right. It matches precisely with

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:20.080
history. I want to convey this again. You know, many New Testament scholars, even I've done shows

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:27.760
with them and, you know, they're much nicer than I am about this. They go, well, I had some way.

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:33.520
No, this is, we're not talking about, you know, there was a wrong approach or whatever. This is

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:40.880
chicanery. This is the kind of stuff that if you're an attorney in the United States, and you

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:46.400
played with the contract, and that was discovered, you'd be disbarred for that. You'd be thrown in

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:52.480
prison in the United States, or any civilized country for engaging in this kind of tampering

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:57.120
with contracts. And that's not an ordinary, this is not a real estate contract. This is,

01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:02.480
you believe the Word of God. What does that say to you? I mean, why would you play with the Word

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:07.040
of God? And not only, and even outside of the Bible, like when you get this, the Josephus,

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:13.760
the famous text about Josephus, with the text, testimony and Flavianum, we know that's been

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:19.520
altered and interpolated and even basically just hacked up. And like you get other areas where

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:24.480
Eusebius just makes up stories that didn't happen. Once you, like, like, like you were mentioning,

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:29.600
this was in a court case, there'd be people going to jail over this, this, you would be no longer

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:35.440
a credible, credible witness. There's nothing you could say anymore that we should listen to.

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:38.480
We're getting caught all over the place, getting caught with the Bible, getting caught outside

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:44.080
of the Bible, the church is all corrupt. Like, it just doesn't look, like if this is the real

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:49.920
religion of a real God, he you would think there would be some order going on here and not just

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:56.080
a bunch of criminals making stuff up, getting caught left and right. You're raising a very,

01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:03.760
very hot item. And that's testimony and Flavian antiquities 1833. Right. The reason why this is

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:10.320
insane that you brought that up, because this is amping it up further. Here, all scholars,

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:16.320
Christian or non Christian concede that this text has been completely corrupted. The only

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:23.520
argument is, is it a complete invention? That means the whole thing about Jesus being in Christ,

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:30.240
who was a man, if you can call him a man, means everyone agrees that this is a this has been

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:35.440
corrupted. There's no like some people going around. No, no, it was really a Christian zero

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:40.720
people say that. I mean, you have to really be drinking an enormous amount of propofol. I don't

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:45.920
know if you could drink it. I mean, you have no idea how much Johnny Walker you have to drink

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:51.680
to consume to believe that I mean, Josephus wasn't I see increase. It's literally the nice

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:56.240
see increase just injected into the text. And what's so crazy about this, though,

01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:03.760
is that we all even scholars and atheists and critical scholars, we all and believers alike,

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:08.000
all of us when we talk about this testimony in Flavianum, we can get into this more on another

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.520
day. But just real quick, what blows my mind and I don't understand this, I literally to this day,

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:19.200
I'm like, in shock that we talk about this, like it's not that big of a deal. Like, yeah,

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:24.160
they just just altered the text a little bit. But you know, so wait, hold on, pause it for a

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:30.640
second. Shouldn't this should this should be like all over the place? Like, it doesn't matter if it

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:36.880
was originally some skeleton version of this or not, whether it's all invented and all forged

01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:43.360
completely, or if it's interpolated, that is a big deal. That should be like, holy crap, the church

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:47.840
is messing around and trying to change things. If it's if this is all true, they shouldn't have

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:53.920
to do anything. Let the word be the word and let it let God do his thing. Why are you have to

01:12:53.920 --> 01:13:02.000
why to do all these extra stuff? Right? That's what I'm getting at. Right. So here's where it goes.

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:10.720
If Christian scribes were perfectly willing to corrupt their own New Testament, for example,

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:16.480
add in 12 verses at the end of the book of Mark, because Mark has no appearances,

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:24.480
resurrection appearances, it ends at chapter 16, verse eight, if they're willing to mess with their

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:30.640
own New Testament, adding in the story of the adulterous woman in in the book of John,

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:39.200
to chain to add in Luke 22 19, half of that passage and all of verse 20 is added in because

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:45.040
Luke didn't have the Eucharist didn't doesn't have vicarious atonement. So therefore,

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:50.560
if they're willing to mess with their own Christian Bible, what do you think they would do to

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:55.600
Josephus? Like Josephus is not considered a holy book to them. Right. And incidentally,

01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:02.560
loads of church fathers quoted Josephus, origin was a genius, origin was a third century church

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:09.520
father, no doubt the bride. He didn't even know that that verse was there. He wouldn't. That means

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:17.280
he's calling Josephus up and down. I do want this third century. Origin, just so you know,

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:22.160
was only one of two church fathers that's that was completely fluent in Hebrew, only him and

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:28.960
Jerome. Yeah, origin was really was a genius. He was a prodigy in his teens already. He was

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:35.280
Jerome says that he wrote 2000 books in his life. That might be an exaggeration, but he was just

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:41.760
he was really quite. He knew Josephus backwards and forth. He didn't think that was important.

01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:49.040
Moreover, origin says in his commentary on Matthew chapter 16, that Josephus was not a Christian.

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:55.600
Yeah, he's too bad he didn't believe in Jesus. Right. He said he he says that it means zero

01:14:55.600 --> 01:15:00.880
church fathers. Nobody and suddenly at the same time of the council I see approximately,

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:08.640
you see it as you said the the the historian of the church, right? He he's the one

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:14.000
who's responsible for inserting testimony in Flavium. But this shouldn't come to surprise

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.240
anyone because you have a criminal endeavor already changing the Hebrew Bible in order

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:26.560
to make it appear Christological, changing the Christian Bible in order so that Mark matches

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:32.480
Matthew. And that's why my friends Luke didn't believe in vicarious atonement didn't believe

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:39.040
that Jesus died as a as a sin offering as a ransom for your sins. And that's why you'll have in

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:45.920
Mark chapter 10 verse 45 and Matthew chapter 20 verse 28, the reference to Jesus died as a ransom

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:50.320
for your sins, but appears nowhere in the book of Luke because Luke didn't believe in that.

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:57.680
And therefore they had to corrupt Luke 22 in order so that the Eucharist Luke matches Matthew

01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:03.120
and Mark. If they would do that to their own Bible, what do you think they would do to Josephus?

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:09.520
I mean, this is a no brainer. Exactly. Yep. Well, this has been fun, like always. And

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:15.360
yeah, and he also want to add in anything going on books, anything like that. Yeah,

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:22.640
I mean, you know, my books are, let's get biblical and have a fairly large channel on YouTube. And

01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:29.040
it was a joy to do this with you. And I look forward to doing another program and it was just

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:34.640
great. This is a very exciting topic. Yes, it is. And like I always say, you have just attained true

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:39.840
gnosis. You have just attained true gnosis.

01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:45.440
The demiurge has no power over
