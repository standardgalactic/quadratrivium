This book aims to provide a comprehensive view of Yahwism, the religion of the God Yahweh, during this significant historical period. It promises to be a game-changer in biblical scholarship and a reference work for future research.

4. The book includes diverse perspectives from various scholars, some of whom may disagree with each other, offering readers a range of arguments and positions on the subject.

5. Audiences can look forward to pre-ordering this influential book, which is already listed on distributor websites. It's anticipated that "Yahwism under the Achaemenid Empire" will be a seminal work in biblical studies for many years to come.

Checking Gnostic Informant/Bible Scholars are WRONG about the New Testament.txt
 In this conversation, Dr. Larry Hurtado discusses the challenges of studying early Christianity with academic rigor in an environment where religious beliefs often overshadow scholarly analysis. He emphasizes that the study of early Christianity should be approached as any other historical subject, with the same level of scrutiny and critical examination. Dr. Hurtado's approach in his book "Resurrection and Reception: Early Christianity and Its Western Environment" was to write for a future generation where scholarly investigation into religion is less influenced by personal beliefs and more grounded in humanities and historical rigor.

He highlights the issue with conferences like SBL (Society of Biblical Literature) where academic presentations are often swayed by faith-based interpretations, as seen when a presentation on the historicity of biblical miracles received a standing ovation. Dr. Hurtado points out that this environment is not unique to any other field of study and would be comparable to scientists at the Royal Society receiving acclaim for presenting unverified myths like those of King Arthur.

Dr. Hurtado is currently working on another book project that explores the criminal aspects of earliest Christianity, examining why early Christians were imprisoned or killed and whether they were breaking specific laws or if their persecution was due to broader political and social factors. He invites viewers interested in these topics to consider participating in or contributing to such scholarly endeavors.

The conversation underscores the importance of historical accuracy and academic freedom in the study of early Christianity, as well as the potential influence this field has on contemporary world events and human understanding. Dr. Hurtado's work aims to balance the picture of early Christianity by providing insights that are grounded in the actual ancient world context.

Checking Gnostic Informant/Daniel's Messiah is NOT Jesus.txt
 In this discussion, the speakers are examining the historical reliability of Flavius Josephus, a first-century Jewish historian, and his references within Christian texts. They argue that if early Christian scribes and scholars were willing to alter their own New Testament texts to suit theological narratives—such as adding verses about the resurrection or vicarious atonement where they did not originally exist—then it is reasonable to suspect that similar alterations could have been made to Josephus' works, especially since Josephus is not considered a holy book in Christian tradition and his writings were known to be accessible to church fathers like Origen.

The speakers highlight the fact that Origen, who was well-versed in Hebrew and knew Josephus' work intimately, did not consider it important to ensure that the Christian Bible and Josephus matched in certain historical accounts. This raises questions about the integrity of the text of Josephus as it has come down to us, particularly the Testimonium Flavianum, which is a key passage often cited by Christians as evidence for the existence of Jesus Christ.

The discussion also touches on theological discrepancies within the Gospels themselves, with each Gospel presenting different accounts and emphases (e.g., vicarious atonement in Matthew and Luke but not in Mark or John). This suggests that early Christians were not averse to altering texts to fit their theological perspectives.

The speakers conclude by emphasizing that if such alterations could occur within the Christian canon, it is plausible, if not likely, that similar changes were made to Josephus' writings. They also express enthusiasm for the topic and the importance of critical analysis in historical scholarship. The conversation underscores the complexity of textual criticism and the importance of considering the motivations and actions of those who have transmitted texts throughout history.

Checking Gnostic Informant/Oldest Origins of Biblical Yahweh are Shocking.txt
1. **Historical Context**: In the 2nd century BCE, Demetrius of Phalerum, an Athenian statesman and philosopher, wrote a letter to King Antiochus III the Great of the Seleucid Empire. This correspondence was prompted by the king's request for access to Jewish books for translation into Greek.

2. **Demetrius' Proposal**: Demetrius suggested that it would be beneficial for both the Greeks and the Jews to transcribe and interpret the Jewish laws, as this would foster mutual understanding and respect between cultures. He also emphasized the importance of freeing Jewish slaves in the kingdom, as they worshipped the same God as the Greeks did under the name of Zeus or Jupiter.

3. **Monotheistic Tendencies**: Demetrius' letter indicates a trend towards monotheism among the Jews, as they were already moving away from polytheism towards exclusive worship of Yahweh, which was becoming syncretized with Greek and other Near Eastern deities like Zeus or Amen Ra.

4. **Cultural Syncretism**: The fusion of Jewish monotheism with Hellenistic religion was part of a broader trend in the Mediterranean world, where different religious concepts were blending, leading to a more unified monist view of the divine.

5. **Plutarch's Explanation of "Amen"**: Plutarch, in his work "Moralia," discusses the term "Amen," used by the Egyptians as a form of address for their supreme god, whom they considered to be equivalent to the universe and invisible. This supports the idea that there was already a conceptual convergence towards a singular divine entity across different cultures and religions.

6. **Influence on Future Theologies**: The philosophical trends from Platonism to Middle Platonism and Neoplatonism, as well as the syncretistic tendencies of the time, would continue to influence the development of religious thought and theology in various cultures and religions, including the evolution of Judeo-Christian beliefs.

In summary, Demetrius' letter reflects a significant moment in history where Jewish monotheism was influencing Hellenistic polytheism, and vice versa, as part of a larger trend towards syncretism and monotheism in the Mediterranean world. This cultural exchange would have profound implications for religious thought and practice in the centuries to follow.

Checking Gnostic Informant/Plato's Terrifying Secret Doctrines ｜ Jason Reza Jorjani.txt
 In this discussion, Neil and his guest explore the themes of mask-wearing, identity, and the search for truth as seen in Plato's philosophical work and reflected in contemporary culture, including the film "The Dark Knight." They touch upon how Plato uses characters like Socrates as masks to convey deeper philosophical ideas. The conversation delves into the concept of ethos and how it defines individuals within different castes in Plato's ideal state, emphasizing that those in positions of power, like warriors, are not necessarily geniuses but possess noble character.

Neil highlights his own philosophical project as an esoteric one, inspired by Plato, and distinct from any particular school of thought like Nietzscheanism or Heideggerianism. He invites the audience to engage with his work further through his YouTube channel, Prometheism, where he continues to produce content and is currently writing a new book.

The dialogue also touches upon the idea of an IQ test that Plato presents in his works, challenging individuals to interpret and respond to these philosophical questions, which ultimately reveal their character and understanding of ethos. The discussion ends with Neil encouraging viewers to subscribe to his channel for more insights into his philosophical endeavors.

Checking Gnostic Informant/Prometheus the Adversary ｜ Jason Reza Jorjani.txt
 The conversation revolves around the myth of Prometheus and its relevance to contemporary issues such as technological advancement and environmental challenges like climate change. The speakers discuss the dual nature of Prometheus as both a symbol of humanity's quest for knowledge and liberation through fire (technology) and the arts, and as a cautionary tale about the potential dangers of unchecked technological progress.

They emphasize that Prometheus represents more than just the scientific or industrial aspects of human progress; it also encompasses the creative, aesthetic dimensions that should guide our use of technology. The goal is to harness technology in a way that is poetic and empowering rather than dehumanizing.

The conversation touches on the idea that humanity can not only imitate nature but potentially surpass it and the gods, as per Shelley's "Prometheus Unbound." This perspective challenges traditional Christian views that see human ambition to improve upon creation as hubris or even Satanic. From a Gnostic standpoint, which seeks transcendence of the material world, this human aspiration to better nature and the gods is particularly provocative.

The speakers also reference Jason Reza Jorjani's works on philosophy and Gnosis, which offer insights into understanding the Promethean myth in a broader metaphysical context. The conversation concludes by acknowledging that by seeking knowledge and challenging the power of the Demiurge (a concept from Gnostic thought representing an imperfect god of this world), one can achieve true Gnosis, gaining freedom from the limitations imposed by traditional religious and societal norms.

Checking Gnostic Informant/Stuff they WON'T tell you in CHURCH ｜ Ammon Hillman.txt
1. In the conversation, the host discusses Greek words for heaven and paradise as used in the New Testament. The Greek word for heaven is "ouranos," which is also the term for the sky or air. The word for paradise is "paradisos," derived from an older Persian word meaning a walled park or garden, which the Greeks adopted and Hellenized.

2. The host clarifies that Jesus claimed to be the son of Yahweh, the God of the Old Testament, as described in the Bible.

3. The host acknowledges viewers' contributions, such as super chats, support, and memberships, expressing appreciation for their engagement with the channel.

4. A mention is made of a viewer named Melody Joy who has been watching the channel since it had under a thousand subscribers.

5. The host promotes another channel called "Drawing Down the Stars," which focuses on deep mystery religion content, and encourages viewers to subscribe to it for more related content and upcoming collaborations.

6. The host announces an upcoming event where Dr. Dennis McDonald will present his memesis theory, proposing that the New Testament stories are derived from the Greek homers' Odyssey and Iliad, to Professor Gregory Crane, the founder of Perseus Tufts, on Derek's channel, MythVision, at 1 PM Eastern time tomorrow.

7. The host concludes by suggesting that viewers achieve true gnosis and that the Demiurge, a term from Gnostic philosophy referring to the creator god of this universe (often seen as inferior or false), has no power over them. This is likely said in the context of gaining deeper knowledge or understanding.

Checking Gnostic Informant/They Lied about the First 100 Years of Christianity ｜ DOCUMENTARY.txt
1. The Apostle Paul distinguishes between speaking in tongues and prophesying, emphasizing that the latter edifies the church more than the former unless it is interpreted.
   
2. The Gnostics were a group of early Christians who valued personal spiritual knowledge (gnosis) and often spoke in tongues as part of their ecstatic religious experiences.
   
3. Justin Martyr's opposition to Marcion in the mid-second century led to a significant schism within Christianity, with the Gnostics being seen as heretical by what later became known as Orthodox Christians.
   
4. Despite being labeled heretics, Gnostic ideas and practices influenced various movements throughout history, including the Ebionites, Bogomiles, Cathars, and Manichaeism.
   
5. Mani, a prophet who considered himself an apostle of Jesus Christ, founded Manichaeism, a religion that incorporated teachings from various spiritual traditions and thrived across different regions.
   
6. The Roman Emperor Theodosius issued a decree making Orthodox Christianity the official state religion of the Roman Empire, leading to persecution of Gnostics and other Christian sects.
   
7. The history of early Christianity shows a complex interplay between orthodoxy and heresy, with the "correct" doctrines often being determined by political and power dynamics rather than solely on the basis of biblical teachings or apostolic practice.
   
8. The discussion around which doctrines are correct or heretical is nuanced and should be based on a careful consideration of scripture, apostolic teaching, and historical context, rather than on personal biases or the authority of a single religious leader.
   
In conclusion, the early history of Christianity was marked by diverse beliefs and practices, and the distinction between orthodoxy and heresy is not always clear-cut. It's important to approach these historical and doctrinal issues with an open mind and a commitment to following Jesus' teachings as recorded in the New Testament.

Checking Gnostic Informant/Why is there a naked boy in Mark 14？ ｜ Ammon Hillman.txt
 In this conversation, the speakers are discussing themes from ancient Greek literature, specifically referencing Ovid and Orpheus, and connecting them to a deeper understanding of religious or spiritual concepts as presented in the New Testament, particularly in the Gospel of Mark, chapter 14. The speaker who is referencing Ovid notes that Orpheus was a figure with such magnetic charm that he attracted many women, but also turned to youths before they reached maturity, which could be interpreted as a metaphor for spiritual awakening or love that transcends physical boundaries.

The discussion then shifts to the idea of being at war, which is a metaphor for the struggle against the 'demiurge' or the lesser god of the Gnostic belief system, who represents an imperfect creator god in some Gnostic traditions. The speakers are essentially framing their discussion as part of a spiritual battle or awakening, where they claim to be bringing forth 'the apocalypse,' not in a destructive sense but as a revelation or unveiling of greater truths, symbolized by the 'lightning bringers' from the story of Sodom.

The conversation also touches on themes of rejection and unrequited love, as well as the idea of sacrificing oneself for a higher purpose, which can be seen in Orpheus' myth where he descends into the underworld to retrieve Eurydice, only to lose her again by looking back. The speakers are drawing parallels between these ancient stories and the narrative of Jesus Christ, particularly his sacrifice and the themes of love, rejection, and ultimate redemption.

Overall, the speaker is commending another individual, Elvis, for contributing to this enlightening discussion and for helping to reveal the deeper mysteries within these texts, emphasizing that by understanding these ancient narratives, one can attain 'true gnosis' or profound spiritual knowledge, which frees one from the influence of the demiurge.

Checking Gnostic Informant/Zarathustra： Founder of GNOSIS ｜ Jason Reza Jorjani.txt
1. **Zarathustra's Influence**: Zarathustra, the founder of Zoroastrianism, experienced a revival in the modern era starting in the 1700s. This was due to translations by linguists and the interest of philosophers like Hegel and Nietzsche, who saw Zarathustra as a significant figure for the Age of Enlightenment.

2. **Nietzsche and Zarathustra**: Nietzsche drew heavily on the character Zarathustra in his philosophical work "Also sprach Zarathustra," which influenced many aspects of modern European culture, including literature and music.

3. **Zoroastrianism vs. Zorvanism**: Zoroastrianism is often confused with Zorvanism, a later Persian dualist religion that was influenced by Zoroastrian ideas but was not the original teaching of Zarathustra. Despite this, Alfred Adler referred to Nietzsche as a Zorvanist per accidente due to similarities in their views on life and existence.

4. **Jungian Psychology**: Carl Jung's work, particularly his concept of archetypes and certain Gnostic elements in his thought, reflect influences from both Zoroastrianism and the later dualistic interpretations of Zarathustra's teachings.

5. **Modern Gnosticism**: The ideas of Zarathustra and Zoroastrianism have influenced various thinkers during the Enlightenment and into the 19th century, contributing to what some scholars refer to as modern Gnosticism.

6. **Future Discussion**: The hosts suggest exploring this topic further in a future program, delving into modern interpretations of Gnosticism, Zoroastrianism, and their impact on Western thought, including figures like Nietzsche and Jung.

7. **Audience Engagement**: The hosts invite listeners to leave comments with their thoughts or additional information that could contribute to the ongoing conversation about the influence of Zarathustra and Zoroastrianism on modern thought.
