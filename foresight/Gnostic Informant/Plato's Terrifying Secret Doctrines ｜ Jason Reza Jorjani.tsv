0	11000	Plato's noble lie isn't simply one concept or one strategy that he deploys as part of the larger edifice of his thought.
11000	25000	Plato's entire philosophical project could be seen as a noble lie, where my thesis is essentially that Plato didn't believe in the existence of the forms.
25000	34000	That he contrived this doctrine for the purposes of psychological and social engineering.
34000	53000	Before he met Socrates, he was an aspiring tragic poet in the theater of Dionysus, and the story is that after he heard Socrates talk, he burned his great tragedy in an offering to Prometheus.
54000	62000	He calls forth the god of fire and decides to become a student of Socrates, but he's coming from the background of having been a tragic poet.
62000	65000	Dionysus is the god associated with tragedy.
65000	92000	A case can be made that people who understood very well what Plato's esoteric project was, and people who knew how to deploy noble lies engineered the Abrahamic revelation, the biblical religion as a catalyst for the transformation of society.
93000	105000	But the catalyst was not intended to get people to become good Jews, or later good Christians, or even later good Muslims.
105000	118000	The catalyst was intended to get people to go to the devil, instigate rebellion, give people models of challenging authority.
118000	124000	That's very Plato. His intention was to separate the goat from the sheep.
130000	132000	Well, it's great to be back with you.
132000	133000	Yeah.
133000	141000	We've been planning this talk on Plato for a really long time, and it's a difficult subject to approach.
141000	157000	I've written two essays that are relevant to it, which I want to reference right up front, because as deep as we may go here, it's still only going to be scratching the surface compared to the complexity of what I've written in these essays.
157000	163000	And the most important of them is called The Pharmacon Artist in Lovers of Sophia.
163000	166000	So I believe it's the second essay in this book.
166000	170000	This book Lovers of Sophia, it's an anthology.
170000	174000	It's a collection of essays rather than really being a book.
174000	179000	And these essays were actually written before Prometheus and Atlas.
179000	187000	I think almost every piece in Lovers of Sophia preceded Prometheus and Atlas in some cases significantly.
187000	194000	And frankly, I have to confess that Pharmacon Artist is the oldest of them.
194000	212000	So in that essay on Plato, which is fitting, because as I quote Alfred North Whitehead at the beginning of this essay, some people have taken the view that the whole history of Western philosophy consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.
212000	213000	That's how Whitehead put it.
213000	222000	And so I suppose it's fitting that my own first philosophical work was my interpretation of Plato, which is an essay of almost book length.
222000	225000	It could be a short book.
225000	230000	And I wrote it in my 20s.
230000	238000	And in a lot of ways, this essay The Pharmacon Artist can be seen as an esoteric key to my entire corpus.
238000	244000	And by the end of our conversation, maybe I'm going to highlight a few ways in which that's the case.
244000	251000	So that essay in Lovers of Sophia, and then there is a chapter in Prometheus and Atlas toward the end.
251000	260000	I believe it is chapter 9 of Prometheus and Atlas.
260000	269000	Atlas of the New Atlantis deals with Plato's quote myth, unquote, of Atlantis.
269000	280000	And we'll get into that as well here because I think it's very relevant to understanding what we could call Plato's unwritten doctrine or esoteric Plato.
281000	286000	His knowledge concerning Atlantis is very relevant to that subject.
286000	301000	And in that chapter, Atlas of the New Atlantis, I get into, you know, Plato's understanding of Atlantis and how it's related to the way in which he wanted to transform Greek society.
301000	305000	So anyway, those are the two references that I wanted to give up front.
305000	311000	And I mean, do you have any prefertory remarks you'd like to make before we jump in?
311000	322000	Yeah, I just want to lay this out for people that this we didn't know that we didn't plan this out as a series to begin with, but it's becoming it's materializing as one now.
322000	328000	So we started off our discussion. This is going to be a four part playlist on my channel for people who are watching.
328000	333000	It's okay if you use the first video you stumble on, you can watch this one first, you can watch them in any order.
333000	345000	But I would prefer to start off with the Mithra video because Mithra is such an ancient idea that has his has his tentacles in the Vedic world as well as the Western world.
345000	353000	And then so that was our first video we introduced that and then we went into Zoroaster and Zoroaster coming out of the Mithraic tradition,
353000	359000	which revolutionizes religion, theology, philosophy for the entire Western world.
359000	363000	And so then after that video we did Prometheism.
363000	381000	And why that's so important to come third is because from the Prometheism video really shows that there's a divide in the world between people who are submitting to this idea of a tyrant god, the L cults, the Judeo-Christian religions,
381000	389000	versus the Promethean religions of divine knowledge that you yourself become like the gods.
389000	395000	So there's this idea of the two and now we're getting into Plato.
395000	400000	And so Plato is going to be the end of all this, but also the beginning of something else.
400000	410000	And so if you want, based on what I just said, tell us why this is so important to have Plato at the end of this.
410000	418000	You know, I don't want to go on about Iran again, you know, and continue to give people the impression that I'm some kind of Persian chauvinist.
418000	426000	But there are a few points that could be made with relation to these other conversations of ours that you referenced.
426000	431000	And one is that, of course, Plato was a member of the Pythagorean order.
431000	437000	After the death of Socrates, Plato went to Italy and joined the Pythagorean order.
437000	442000	And, you know, of course, Pythagoras himself had studied at length in Egypt.
442000	454000	And so Plato kind of followed Pythagoras' footsteps and then studied in Egypt for a while, tracing, you know, some Pythagorean ideas to their source in ancient Egyptian wisdom.
454000	462000	But as we've discussed in our previous conversations, Pythagoras also studied for over a decade in the capital of the Persian Empire.
462000	468000	He was brought back to the capital of Iran by Cambyses II, the son of Cyrus the Great.
468000	476000	And he studied with the Magi in Babylon, the administrative capital of, you know, Achaemenid Iran.
477000	488000	And so, and by the way, Pythagoras only left Iran when the Persians conquered Samos.
488000	490000	He was from Samos.
490000	497000	And so he only goes home once his homeland, his island, becomes part of the Persian Empire.
497000	510000	And there's some evidence to suggest that basically he was kind of sent on a mission by the Magi and that his founding of the Pythagorean order in Sicily is an extension of sort of the Magian order of Babylon and so forth.
510000	525000	And so here you have one of Plato's sources of wisdom, namely the Pythagorean order, having been fundamentally shaped by Mithraic, Zoroastrian thought.
525000	542000	And then Plato, as we're going to get into in this conversation, very significantly, Plato's, I don't know if you want to say, second most important source of influence, whatever, another major influence on him was the School of Heraclitus.
543000	545000	And in fact, let me reference this right here.
545000	557000	Okay, Aristotle tells us that Plato in his youth, presumably after the death of Socrates, Socrates died when Plato was still quite young.
557000	574000	But presumably, immediately after the death of Socrates, Plato became a Heraclitian, and specifically he studied with this Heraclitian teacher, Cradolis, okay, Cradolis who was a thinker in the School of Heraclitus.
575000	588000	And actually, we just want to take the time for a moment to read this quote here, because it's very significant to the argument that I want to lay out about Plato's unwritten doctrine.
589000	607000	One is where Aristotle tells us in his metaphysics, quote, for as a young man, Plato was originally an associate of Cradolis and Heraclitian opinions to the effect that all perceptible things were in a permanent state of flux, and that there was no knowledge of them.
607000	612000	And these things he also later on maintained, unquote.
612000	622000	Then there's another remark regarding this from Aristotle, also in his metaphysics, and by the way, for those who are not familiar, Aristotle was Plato's student, okay.
622000	629000	Actually, Aristotle was Plato's greatest student, even though Plato did not choose him to head the academy after his death.
629000	640000	So, you know, Aristotle is a fairly good witness and source of testimony regarding the developmental trajectory of Plato's thought.
640000	661000	And the other thing he tells us in metaphysics concerning the Heraclitian background to Plato's philosophy is this quote, now the starting point for those who came up with the theory of forms was a conviction of the truth of the Heraclitian considerations to the effect that all perceptible objects are in a permanent state of flux,
662000	680000	so that a condition on the very possibility of knowledge and understanding was the existence, in addition to the perceptible ones of certain other natural entities which are not in a state of flux, on the assumption that entities in flux were not possible objects of knowledge, unquote.
680000	685000	Okay, so this is what Aristotle tells us about.
685000	692000	And then there's one other remark that's specifically about Plato's Heraclitian teacher, Cratalus.
692000	710000	So this is Aristotle commenting on Plato's teacher from the School of Heraclitus, quote, they meaning the Heraclitians, observed that all nature around us undergoes change and held that one cannot speak the truth about that which is undergoing change.
710000	723000	So a for teriori, nothing true could be said about what was changing at all points in all ways. This is the position of those who appropriated the legacy of Heraclitus, notably of Cratalus.
723000	732000	His mature position was that speech of any kind was radically inappropriate and that expression should be restricted exclusively to the movement of the finger.
732000	745000	He was appalled that Heraclitus had claimed that you could not step twice into the same river. In his Cratalus's opinion, it was already going too far to admit stepping into the same river once.
745000	757000	So that was, well, I presented that as a kind of a side, but it's going to become key to the argument that I want to make. But I took the time to just, you know,
757000	771000	put those quotes out there because Heraclitus was invited by Darius the Great, the Emperor of the Persian Empire to be the court philosopher of Iran.
771000	772000	Wow.
773000	788000	Okay, so look, in a country where you have all these Magi who are the bearers of the legacy of Zarathustra, Darius doesn't choose one of his fellow Iranian magi to be the court philosopher of the Persian Empire.
788000	796000	He invites this Greek from Ephesus to come to the Persian court. Now, of course, Heraclitus refuses.
796000	811000	Instead, he exiles himself to the temple of Artemis in Ephesus, never leaves other than to come out onto the temple steps and play games with children whose parents are, you know, visiting to basically worship the goddess.
811000	826000	But Artemis, the goddess whose temple Heraclitus sequesters himself to, is also originally an Iranian goddess, specifically worshipped by the Sarmatians. So Heraclitus is very clearly in the Iranian orbit spiritually.
826000	832000	And so now we have a second major influence on Plato, who steeped in Iranian thought, Heraclitus.
832000	847000	Let me just jump in for one second. Artemis has the subtitle, her name, her nickname, Luciferia. She is like the female aspect of Lucifer.
847000	859000	So you have this, and we talked about this in Prometheus, this idea of the opposing viewpoint of these two different views on what God is or which God we should give our devotion to.
859000	869000	And so here we are with this court with the goddess whose subtitle's name is Luciferia, and that's from Calimacus. I can show the sources if you guys want.
869000	885000	I'll add something esoteric that makes this even more striking. So the name Artemis, contrary to what some linguists have argued, doesn't really mean anything in Greek, but it means a hell of a lot in the original Old Iranian.
885000	896000	And that's Arta Amesha. Arta Amesha means immortal truth. Arta meant truth in the sense of like logos, cosmic order.
896000	908000	And so it's the undying cosmic order, which by the way was symbolized by fire. Heraclitus, fire becomes, you know, the metaphor for cosmic energy in his thinking.
908000	924000	Arta Amesha means immortal truth in Old Iranian. And it's a, what do you call it? They say se fatin Persian. It's a quality. It's an epithet. It's a descriptor.
924000	938000	But the actual name of the deity that was worshiped by the Sarmatians, who is described as Arta Amesha or immortal truth was Satana or Shatana.
938000	939000	Wow.
939000	948000	So, and so I've always thought that, look, I mean, this culture, the Scythians invaded. The Scythians and Sarmatians are kindred cultures.
948000	963000	In some cases, they're almost indistinguishable from one another. And they invaded the Middle East by at least 700 BC. And we know they got as far as the border of Palestine with Egypt.
963000	990000	Okay. Or the border of Israel with Egypt. And so I've always thought that this reference Hashaytan in Hebrew actually is coming from the name of Shatana and was a demonization of this serpentine goddess figure of the Sarmatians who had, you know, serpents entwined around her and who was served by the Gorgons.
990000	1016000	The Gorgons were sort of goddess figures associated with this great goddess. And so in any case, there's a lot there, you know, behind Artemis and the figure that of course Heraclitus decided to devote himself to or rather at least take refuge in her in the sanctum of her temple, rather than accepting the invitation of Darius the Great.
1016000	1030000	Anyway, we want an attention. My point was that Plato is influenced by at least two figures who are steeped in Iranian thinking Pythagoras and Heraclitus. So did you want to
1030000	1043000	Well, okay, so I just want I'm glad we laid that out because I'm trying to show the setting in which we're in that leads up to the world that Plato so when we get to by the time we get to Plato.
1044000	1059000	Plato is inch is he's initiated into the Pythagoreans. But we hear about him at his funeral. According to people who write about his field, leave us Aristotle, the Magi attended his funeral.
1059000	1063000	So what, what is he, what is he?
1063000	1075000	I got distracted. This was the third thing that I was going to mention is that I believe it is Aristotle, and this is reported on by Mary said aghast in her book, when Zarathustra spoke.
1075000	1083000	According to classical sources, the Magi attended Plato's funeral and they claimed he was a member of the order.
1083000	1100000	Okay, now this doesn't mean that Plato was like a Zoroastrian or something. Okay, like this is a common misconceptions today. Order of the Magi, you know, I discussed this at length in Iranian Leviathan originally was a Mithraic order.
1100000	1115000	And it was very esoteric. You know, it had incorporated various Babylonian and Assyrian beliefs into it and so forth child in astrology. And so it was a complex esoteric order.
1115000	1132000	And just because Plato was a member of the order of the Magi, I didn't mean that he wasn't also a member of the Pythagorean order and also this and also that I mean, today, people who belong to Freemasonry tend to also belong to I don't know the Golden Dawn and any number of other esoteric societies.
1132000	1136000	And so Plato was probably such a person in those days.
1136000	1139000	He said aghast initiated into seven different things.
1140000	1158000	Yeah, but it's worth mentioning that, you know, Plato wanted to go to Persia after traveling to Italy and Egypt, never made it to Persia, but, you know, the Persian Empire extended into Greece into parts of Greece, and it appears at some point he was initiated into the order of the magi.
1158000	1161000	And the magi considered him among their own.
1162000	1169000	Okay, here's a good lead into the, you know, conversation that I really want to have.
1169000	1190000	The most striking thing about Plato being a magus, a member of the order of the magi is his concept of the noble lie, because as Herodotus tells us and as we know directly from the compositions of Zarathustra, lying was considered the worst thing among the Persians and
1190000	1201000	well, I was going to say among Zarathustrians in particular but also in Mithra's early Mithra's Mithra's the God of Odes and contracts right this raising of the right hand that we have to this day.
1201000	1204000	This is a Mithraic oath.
1204000	1209000	You know when you raise your right hand to supposedly tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth in court and so forth.
1209000	1215000	And so how is Plato a member of the order of the magi and also someone who's advocating this concept of the noble lie.
1216000	1223000	Now in Iranian Leviathan, I have a whole chapter called Emperor of Noble Lies which is about Darius the Great.
1223000	1240000	And I showed that the understanding of truth that prevailed amongst the Mithraic initiates in Iran was a lot more complex than some simplistic idea of, you know, honesty to a fault, right.
1240000	1258000	And, you know, so someone who wants to understand the nuances of the concept of truth and its relationship to strategic deception in an Iranian context should look at that chapter, Emperor of Noble Lies about Darius the Great in Iranian Leviathan.
1258000	1264000	But to bring the conversation back to Plato.
1264000	1282000	This essay pharmacon artist that I referenced at the outset, I argued that Plato's noble lie isn't simply one concept, or one strategy that he deploys as part of the larger edifice of his thought.
1282000	1294000	Plato's entire philosophical project could be seen as a noble lie by his entire philosophical project I mean the elaboration of the so called theory of forms.
1294000	1300000	So I make this really radical argument in the pharmacon artist.
1300000	1322000	The highlights of which, you know, I'd like to discuss with you where my thesis is essentially that Plato didn't believe in the existence of the forms that he contrived this doctrine for the purposes of psychological and social engineering.
1322000	1351000	And that his quote unquote unwritten doctrine which he confesses to having is one that is, let's say, deeper than or, yeah, let's say deeper than more profound than this exoteric theory of forms that he publicly disseminates and that becomes so seminal and pivotal in the history of western rationalism.
1351000	1357000	So that's the basic thesis that I forward in the essay the pharmacon artist.
1357000	1376000	Now, that's interesting because in the dialogues that Plato gives us there's a really important dialogue called parminides, where he has the master of that time period was parminides.
1376000	1385000	But underneath parminides are these two up and coming sages that are his students, Socrates and Zeno.
1385000	1403000	And Zeno is is he's he's a I guess you would say before the Epicureans he's sort of a not he's against the forms he's more of like an atomic Adams and void, but Socrates in the he has through the mouth of Socrates, he's arguing for forms and he wins the debate,
1403000	1408000	and he convinces parminides that forms is the is the real reality.
1408000	1412000	And so is this part of this, he's setting up.
1412000	1416000	Look, even the great master parminides believes in these forms.
1416000	1417000	Is this what's happening.
1417000	1424000	Right, so okay, parminides is among the most complex platonic dialogues.
1424000	1441000	And in that dialogue parminides, and the dialogue called the sophist, where, you know, Plato is engaging in another one of his critiques of the kind of sophistry that prevailed in his time, where people would hire these tutors to basically teach them how to argue
1441000	1444000	anything regardless of whether they believed in it or not.
1444000	1448000	These two dialogues parminides and the sophist.
1448000	1452000	Plato engages with the thought of parminides.
1452000	1468000	And one of the keys in my argument, one of the key points in the thesis that I lay out in a pharmacon artist is that Plato makes a strong man, both of parminides and of heraclitus in order to develop the theory of forms right.
1468000	1480000	So let me, yeah, since we're on parminides, let's let's go with that and then I'll come back to heraclitus.
1480000	1497000	In essence, what goes on in these two dialogues parminides and the sophist is that Plato feigns stupidity in the guise of Socrates his mouthpiece by
1497000	1508000	misinterpreting what parminides means by being in the sense of the one and by nothingness.
1508000	1523000	Okay, so in the in his way of truth in parminides poem, the way of truth, the parminides was, let's see, about he flourished as they say in the Greek context he flourished around 475 BC.
1523000	1530000	So we're talking about someone living a generation before Socrates and a couple of generations before Plato.
1530000	1538000	And parminides is point in the way of truth is very similar to the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta.
1538000	1543000	It's that the world of multiplicity and change is illusion.
1543000	1553000	And really, the only existent thing is an absolutely unified, eternal and infinite one.
1553000	1565000	So if anything really exists, it has to be one thing of which nothing can really be predicated.
1565000	1581000	And all of the specific characteristics that changing things have changing both in space and over the course of time, all the predicates and qualitative characteristics of changing things are really illusions.
1581000	1596000	Okay, and so, you know, what we really are are sort of like facets of this infinite and eternal one.
1596000	1611000	And we should strive by the power of our transcendental minds to apprehend our union, our, our, yeah, our identity with this transcendental one.
1611000	1632000	And the leatics, the school of parminides would engage in various practices in order to initiate adherence into the mystery of this transcendental oneness, including the use of psychedelic drugs inside caves.
1633000	1647000	So, Plato, besides studying with Cratolus, who was a Heraclitian, Plato at one point studied with, I believe his name was Hermodorus, representative of the school of parminides.
1647000	1666000	So Plato is not getting his own, his only understanding of parminides through Socrates. Plato, prior to having written the parminides and the Sophists dialogues, studied under a leatic or, you know, parminidian teacher himself.
1666000	1677000	And I, okay, so I cannot believe that what we see reflected in the dialogues parminides and Sophists represents Plato's actual understanding of parminides.
1677000	1686000	Because basically, he argues that like parminides doesn't understand what non-being means.
1687000	1702000	That when parminides is saying, look, either you have to say that there's nothing at all, or you have to say that really everything that's in a state of, in a seeming state of change, and all of the multiplicity in the world is actually just a one, right?
1702000	1713000	When he sets up, Plato says that when, when parminides sets up this false binary in the way of truth, his poem, he's mistaking what non-being means.
1713000	1726000	When we say, you know, nothingness or the non-existent, we are just referring to something other than the present state of affairs. It's what we would call it like an indexical reference.
1726000	1734000	So, you know, right now, you know, I'm not sitting in a taxi.
1734000	1753000	So, you know, if I, if I say, you know, like, you know, my laptop on my lap in the taxi now, it's referring to some other state of affairs than the current state of affairs where I'm sitting in this room, right, in this, in this apartment.
1753000	1763000	And so it's a counterfactual that we intend to indicate when we use not such and such, when we use a negation.
1763000	1770000	It's not some mysterious nothingness. This is what Plato is arguing in parminides on this office.
1770000	1789000	And so basically what he's trying to parse out in these dialogues is what we mean when we refer to a true or false state of affairs with some kind of a logically constructed proposition.
1789000	1794000	He's trying to lay the groundwork for epistemology, for theory of knowledge.
1794000	1804000	But Plato, well, let's just say, would have to have been dim in order to believe that this is really what parminides was on about. Right.
1805000	1824000	Clearly, Plato could have understood that by nothingness, parminides meant something like what Gotama Buddha means when he talks about shunyata, and that parminides is, you know, advocacy for an ontology of an absolutely perfect unified and
1824000	1833000	eternal being is similar to the argument of Advaita Vedanta adherence against what they consider Buddhist nihilism.
1833000	1851000	He would at least have had to have that level of understanding. And if you read the Platonic corpus and see the kind of sophistication of thought this man engages in and his flair for irony and sarcasm and the subtlety with which he writes, there's no way to me that that could have been lost on him.
1851000	1860000	And also the numerous passages and various dialogues, especially Phaedrus and Symposium, where Plato reveals himself to be a profound mystic.
1860000	1871000	There's no way that he thought parminides was making this kind of a logical error. And yet he creates this straw man out of parminides.
1871000	1893000	And the other part of the straw man is that he says that what parminides meant by the one is mistaken, that the one is sort of like what makes anything the particular thing that it is.
1894000	1922000	It's like the what what makes a substance cohere as that particular thing that it is. It's not some, you know, mystical vague sort of, you know, oneness that encompasses all things because if there were a oneness that encompasses all things, then anything that you would predicate of that would contradict its essence as infinite and eternal.
1922000	1938000	Right. Like, if you imagine if you imagine the oneness as some mystics have as a sphere that extends in all directions, well, you can't wrap your mind around the outer edges of that sphere without putting the sphere in a certain space in the context of a certain space.
1938000	1940000	There's something outside it.
1940000	1952000	And once you admit that the sphere is inside a certain space, you also admit that it has spatial parts. You can think of the top of the sphere, the side of the sphere, the back of the sphere.
1952000	1966000	So then there's a multiplicity spatially. And then, as you're thinking about the sphere, time is elapsing. So then you're thinking of the sphere as it was in state A, as opposed to state B and what it's going to be in state C.
1966000	1981000	So the sphere winds up or say, you know, it's a rotating sphere, it winds up having temporal parts. So as soon as you have any coherent conception of this sphere of the one, it has both spatial and temporal parts.
1981000	1995000	And anything that you predicate of its spatial and temporal parts contradicts the essence of infinity and eternity that's proper to this one.
1995000	2001000	So this is the kind of argument that he engages in, right, in parmenides in this office.
2001000	2017000	And I think that it's making a straw man out of parmenides. Plato does something similar with Heraclitus. Okay, so Heraclitus is an incredibly sophisticated thinker.
2017000	2040000	This guy, when he describes everything in the cosmos as an ever-changing fire, he is not using fire the way that Thales used water as a kind of element from out of which all other elements or things can be derived, right?
2040000	2054000	He had thinkers very early in the history of pre-socratic philosophy who took one or another element as fundamental. In the case of Thales, it was water and they derived everything else like earth and air and fire from out of it.
2054000	2067000	It's a huge mistake to think that that's what Heraclitus means by fire. If you want to understand what Heraclitus means by fire, look at what Werner Heisenberg says about him in physics and philosophy.
2067000	2087000	He's the greatest German scientist of the era of the Second World War, German physicist rather. Werner Heisenberg, one of the pioneers of quantum theory, writes about Heraclitus in physics and philosophy and says that how Heraclitus describes fire and its relationship with the psyche.
2087000	2111000	And the way in which fire is a metaphor for the Logos, the order in the cosmos, and the relationship between the fire and the psyche to the mind of Werner Heisenberg was some kind of a precursor to the relationship between consciousness and quantum potential in quantum theory.
2111000	2123000	So that what Heraclitus means by fire is something like what we mean by quantum potential. You had these early atomists that thought the world was basically made up of marbles.
2123000	2132000	Their metaphor for the fundamental stuff were something like the marbles the Greek children played with.
2132000	2148000	You had others who believed that some substance like water went through various changes of state and that all things arose, had their genesis in that manner.
2148000	2164000	What Heraclitus is saying is that what everything is made up out of is a dynamic flux that can't be pinned down and that is never in a static state.
2164000	2184000	At no point you find it in a static state, it's something that's always inherently in a dynamic flux and that thing is integrally interconnected with consciousness or what Heraclitus calls psyche, suke.
2184000	2199000	The relationship between suke and this dynamic flux has a Logos to it, it has an order to it. It expresses certain teleology.
2200000	2215000	And this is very similar to what we eventually arrived at on the other side of atomism in the quantum theory that describes the collapse of the quantum wave potential by consciousness.
2215000	2234000	So Heraclitus is so sophisticated in his ontological thinking that Werter Heisenberg I think rightly saw his understanding of the cosmic flux and its relationship to the mind as a precursor of quantum theory.
2234000	2260000	And Heraclitus makes it very clear that he isn't saying there's no such thing as existence. In other words, it's not a view of pure becoming as opposed to being. It's that existence is always in a state of process and this process does have a kind of teleology to it.
2260000	2282000	And so when Aristotle claims that Plato developed the theory of forms, because Heraclitians like Cradilus, Plato's teacher and his youth, thought that you couldn't know anything about things that are in a state of perpetual flux.
2283000	2300000	This is not credible. Okay, there's no way that Plato did not study Heraclitus for himself. There's no way that, you know, this book that we call the fragments today that used to be called On Nature isn't a book that Plato picked up and read for himself.
2300000	2318000	He probably poured over it for years. And as a student of the Heraclitian school. And so even if Cradilus was such an imbecile that he misunderstood Heraclitus so badly that he says, you know, Heraclitus shouldn't have said you can't step into the same river twice.
2318000	2338000	You can't even step into it once, because as your foot is going into the river, it's not the same river the waters keep flowing, right? Even if Cradilus was such an imbecile to believe that Heraclitus was advocating a view of such sheer becoming that, you know, you couldn't know anything about objects, right?
2339000	2356000	That, you know, knowledge was ruled out and that we were going to wind up in a state of like perpetual skepticism regarding everything. There's no way that Plato wouldn't have understood Heraclitus better than Cradilus himself did.
2356000	2368000	Right. I mean, this is typical. Like you go to study a certain doctrine with some teacher. And that teacher is a lame representative of that school of thought. And you're introduced to that school of thought through the particular teacher.
2368000	2379000	But then you go and, you know, study the origins of that thought yourself, and you come to a better understanding of it than this person who, you know, gave you some introductory lessons.
2379000	2380000	Sure.
2380000	2387000	Concern. And so I have to believe that that's the case in terms of Plato's understanding of Heraclitus.
2387000	2401000	And I argue that it is the case on the basis of all kinds of remarks that Plato makes in Cradilus and Theotetus in particular. There are two dialogues, dialogue named after the Heraclitian teacher.
2402000	2428000	And another dialogue Theotetus in which, and you have to read my essay, pharmacon artist to really be able to see, you know, how I do this, but in which if you subtract the forms that Plato's setting forth, the account of the world that you're left with is a deep understanding of the teaching of Heraclitus.
2428000	2441000	So, so, so basically, you can see from in between the lines of Cradilus and Theotetus that Plato thought deeply about the doctrine of Heraclitus.
2441000	2453000	But then he wants to make this straw man from out of Heraclitus, the same straw man that Aristotle gives us when he says Plato studied with Cradilus.
2453000	2468000	And he saw that if you have this view of all things in flux, knowledge is not possible. And so he came up with a theory of forms as a way to build an epistemology to build essentially what becomes the first theory of knowledge and the basis for science ultimately.
2468000	2469000	Yeah.
2470000	2490000	It requires making a straw man out of Heraclitus in order to do that, because see, essentially, essentially what Plato does is this he takes Heraclitus, and he turns them into this cardboard cut out, where everything is in a state of flux, we can't know anything about
2490000	2504000	Heraclitus, right? And in fact, the mind is not stable enough and separate enough from the flux of nature for the subject to predicate anything of objects that have independent existence.
2504000	2519000	He turns this into the view of Heraclitus, right? So everything is flowing. You can't know anything about the dynamic fuses. That's, let's say, the material world, right?
2519000	2529000	Matter is a dynamic fuses that you can't know anything about because it's always flowing. Then he makes a straw man out of Parmenides.
2529000	2530000	Right.
2530000	2547000	And he said, okay, well, what can be salvaged from out of Parmenides is this idea of the one as what gives something enough coherence to be the particular thing that it is, namely, to make it a substance.
2547000	2564000	And he says, instead of there being this one that's synonymous with infinite and eternal being, which would render the entire world of multiplicity and illusion, there is a multiplicity of ones.
2564000	2584000	There's a multiplicity of unities. And this multiplicity of unities interacts with or interferes with nature in a state of flux in order to give us the objects of our perceptible world that we experience.
2584000	2601000	And here, the Pythagorean doctrine becomes significant because this multiplicity of ones, okay, that he's getting from Parmenides, he's adapting from out of Parmenides, it takes a mathematical form which he's getting from the Pythagorean order.
2601000	2617000	And remember Pythagoras quote unquote believed the world is made of number. That's an oversimplification but Pythagoras thought that the fundamental constructs of the physical world were geometric and mathematical in nature.
2617000	2639000	So Plato takes the oneness of the one of Parmenides, and he fuses it with the geometric quality of the fundamental nature of reality as Pythagoras elaborated it, and he creates these forms, which he compares to geometricians, geometers, templates.
2639000	2652000	The templates, the geometers work with templates. They use them in machine shops also, even back in ancient Greece, the templates that, you know, a craftsman technetist, the craftsman's work with.
2652000	2665000	And so you have these templates that each have absolute imperfect unity, right? So the form of the circle is not circular. The form of the circle isn't round.
2665000	2680000	And the form of heaviness isn't actually heavy. It doesn't weigh anything. Each of these forms is absolute. It's perfect. It's infinite and eternal in the same way as the one of Parmenides.
2680000	2702000	The multiplicity of these, and they're of a geometric or mathematical nature, and these infinite and eternal forms interfere with the flux of pure matter, of Hewlett as a kind of dynamic energy, the fire of Heraclitus.
2702000	2717000	And from out of this interference, you get the objects of our world, the things that we experience, right? And also the finitude of the human mind as shaped by experience in a human body.
2717000	2734000	Okay, this is how basically Plato develops the theory of forms by taking a strawman Heraclitus and a strawman Parmenides and fusing them together, also drawing on the mathematical thinking of Pythagoras.
2735000	2753000	And I think the most complete form of this that you see in the Platonic corpus is in the dialogue Timaeus, Plato's dialogue Timaeus, where he talks about how the forms and matter, pure matter in a state of ceaseless flux and chaos,
2754000	2765000	basically, I don't want to say intermix, you know, but how they interact with each other in this void, in this chasm that he describes in Timaeus.
2765000	2788000	And from out of this chasm, this interaction of forms and matter and flux produces the multifarious objects of our experience, of which we can predicate things about which we can know things with reference to the eternal forms, right?
2788000	2817000	So our rational minds are of the same nature as these infinite and eternal forms. And although our minds are ensconced in souls that are further shaped by the conditions of our physical body, it's still possible for our minds to grasp and analyze the physical world in terms of these supposedly non physical forms.
2818000	2827000	And that gives us the basis for, you know, episteme or what later comes to be framed as scientific knowledge about the world.
2828000	2837000	Okay, I'm trying to show this in a way where we can like see the timeline, because if I'm not mistaken.
2838000	2855000	Is it because, okay, Zeno, not Zeno, Parminides comes from what was a part of the Persian Empire, and which is modern day Turkey, he goes to Magna Graecia, which is Italy now, and was Pythagoras there before him?
2856000	2858000	Does he, is he going to the Pythagorean?
2859000	2864000	So he, so he basically joins this Pythagorean movement happening in Magna Graecia.
2864000	2865000	Parminides?
2865000	2866000	Parminides?
2866000	2867000	Yeah.
2867000	2868000	Is that what happens?
2868000	2873000	I haven't seen any evidence that he joined the Pythagorean order, but that's what I'm asking.
2873000	2874000	Are they separate?
2874000	2876000	I think it was first.
2876000	2877000	Pythagoras is first.
2877000	2884000	Parminides comes from, from the East, sets up with the same general area as Pythagoras, but they have two different schools.
2884000	2889000	Now, is this where Heraclitus, is he learning from both of these people?
2889000	2890000	Is he coming?
2890000	2894000	Because I think Heraclitus, well, no, it's Heraclitus.
2894000	2895000	Both of them.
2895000	2896000	Right.
2896000	2900000	But I'm saying Heraclitus, where does he fit in between Pythagoras and Parminides?
2900000	2904000	Is he one of their, is he part of one of those schools or is he a completely different school?
2904000	2906000	Are these, are these three different schools?
2906000	2908000	Different school, different school.
2908000	2910000	So we have three different schools.
2910000	2917000	At least the interesting thing is that Heraclitus hated Pythagoras.
2917000	2920000	They were both coming from out of the Persian Empire.
2920000	2922000	I don't mean just geographically, right?
2922000	2929000	Pythagoras studied for over a decade with the Magi, and then Heraclitus was invited by Darius to become the court philosopher of Iran.
2929000	2934000	So they're both coming from out of this Persian spiritual intellectual background.
2934000	2941000	And yet, Heraclitus hates Pythagoras and takes a few jabs at him in his fragments, where he basically says,
2941000	2948000	Why, like, he's like, uh, charlatan who came up with some like new agey cosmopolitan.
2948000	2949000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2949000	2950000	Just true though.
2950000	2953000	Well, okay, so now I just want to lay that out.
2953000	2958000	We have these three schools that are all three of them seem to be somewhat tied to Persia.
2958000	2963000	They both come to Italy, or they all come to, um, oh no, I'm talking about those two.
2963000	2965000	And then Heraclitus has his own thing.
2965000	2976000	Now Plato, who's coming a century and a half later after Socrates is learning about these schools, which, which are these other pre-Socratics.
2976000	2983000	Now, so my question is this, this is very interesting what you're, what you're laying out because we have these three schools of thought.
2983000	2987000	Is Plato trying to unify them?
2987000	2988000	What is, what is he trying?
2988000	2996000	And what is, what is his goal in, in, in like straw manning these brilliant thinkers?
2996000	2999000	What is he trying to do with these three schools of thought?
2999000	3001000	Yeah, okay, this is really the question.
3001000	3002000	Okay, this is really the question.
3002000	3010000	So in order to answer that, we need to step back and look at the world into which Plato was born.
3010000	3018000	Okay, and the time, the time, you know, and society of these men that we've discussed so far.
3018000	3027000	Homer is often misunderstood as a literary figure and as a poet in the contemporary sense.
3027000	3029000	That's not at all the case.
3029000	3035000	If you read the Iliad and the Odyssey, particularly the Iliad, which is believed to be actually older than the Odyssey.
3035000	3042000	And there's some question about whether the Odyssey, you know, the Iliad and the Odyssey were both oral traditions.
3042000	3056000	And this Homer, who at some point wrote them down, was a particular Bard who sort of codified what was for a long time before that century, before that an oral tradition.
3056000	3076000	But the world that's revealed by the Iliad and the Odyssey is one where basically people are the playthings of fate and, you know, are at the whim of the gods and don't have hardly a thought that's their own or a conscience of their own.
3076000	3087000	At any moment when someone, quote unquote, comes up with an idea in the Iliad, it's because some god suddenly came in and gave them a particular inspiration.
3087000	3092000	Eros comes up with his bow and strikes you, now you're in love with somebody.
3092000	3093000	Yeah, that's the idea.
3093000	3095000	Or when Achilles is by anger.
3095000	3097000	Or when Achilles is seized by anger.
3097000	3104000	When, you know, any passion that seizes a person is attributed to the influence of a certain god.
3104000	3110000	And they would hear these gods and sometimes they would see these gods.
3110000	3113000	And there's no sense of personal conscience.
3113000	3128000	All of the actions taken by the heroes or the villains in the Iliad are basically either dictates of one or another god or they reflect some deeply ingrained social custom and ritual.
3128000	3141000	We're dealing with a completely ritualistic society of custom and incredibly conservative traditional society wherein there was no distinction even between nature and culture.
3141000	3149000	Right, like the same way that birds had certain habits, they had a certain way of life that was proper to them.
3149000	3156000	It was proper for women to be in the kitchen, you know, and to like take care of the domestic sphere.
3156000	3163000	That wasn't considered an aspect of a particular culture and the migratory patterns of birds are an aspect of nature.
3163000	3170000	The distinction between nature and culture is something that was defined by the first philosophers to begin with.
3170000	3173000	It didn't exist in the world of the Iliad.
3173000	3191000	So all of these actions taken by various figures like Agamemnon and Achilles and so forth in the Homeric world are either based on what was expected customarily or they are, you know, they're things that the gods commanded.
3191000	3199000	There's no personal conscience or sense of free will even that would allow for conscientious action.
3200000	3219000	And the other important point is that the medium of the Homeric, let's call it whatever, sagas, the medium of the Homeric epics was something akin to rap music.
3219000	3244000	It was recited and performed in a way where the temple and modality of the poetic performance was meant to sort of contagiously move the audience in a way where they embodied the message being delivered through the medium.
3245000	3250000	A book that's been written about this is Eric Havlock's Preface to Plato.
3250000	3262000	So I refer people to that Havlock's argument in Preface to Plato, where he's saying that we shouldn't think of Homer as poetry in anything like contemporary sense.
3262000	3273000	It's more like a cultural encyclopedia of like, for example, there's huge passages on ship building in the Iliad like how to build ships.
3273000	3278000	That knowledge was transmitted through this poetry quote unquote.
3278000	3284000	Orphic and Homeric hymns are the predecessor of the internet.
3284000	3287000	Would you agree with that statement?
3287000	3297000	Well, there's something to that in the sense that the internet is becoming yet again a kind of highly mimetic medium.
3298000	3313000	The core idea in Eric Havlock's study, Preface to Plato, is the idea of mimesis or mimicry, action that's highly imitative in which there's no reflection.
3314000	3329000	So it's like highly imitative embodiment of the message being conveyed by a medium without any personal reflection or critical thought about it.
3329000	3342000	And so this is exactly what takes place today, let's say, with bad rap music, not the kind of rap music that occasionally has like thought-provoking messages to it or like revolutionary political rap, but like gangster rap.
3342000	3347000	You know, the old bling-bling gangster rap about money and cars and hose and etc. on whatever, right?
3347000	3357000	And the people who listen to this rap and you can see them like on subways and they're moving their bodies in a certain way as they listen to this rap.
3357000	3364000	The Bacchic revelers were like this. They were just full energy, full just going with it, just going hard.
3364000	3369000	Like that was what, that would be the equivalent of what that rap is.
3369000	3383000	Yeah, and so when you say the internet is like that, it's because in a way like we are being, we are being, how can I put it, barbarized or kind of like being reduced again to a kind of pre-rational,
3383000	3390000	pre-reflective state through the intense mimesis, the mimetic power of the internet, right?
3390000	3394000	Okay, that's a whole critique that's a side conversation.
3394000	3400000	But point being, Plato was dealing with a society where that's what poetry is.
3400000	3408000	And this poetry is totally corrupting children with all kinds of stories about, you know, sadistic and manipulative gods like Zeus,
3408000	3417000	who use people as their playthings and engage in, you know, rape all the time on, you know, using various disguises.
3417000	3426000	And so he considered this totally deleterious to the development of the moral fiber of children.
3426000	3432000	And when he bans the poets in his republic, this is the kind of poetry he's talking about.
3432000	3435000	He's not talking about poetry in the contemporary sense.
3435000	3438000	He's very specifically taking aim at Homer.
3438000	3440000	Okay, let me jump in for one second.
3440000	3441000	Yeah.
3441000	3446000	This is about to, this question is about to lead up to, I know this is going to be the one.
3446000	3447000	This is going to be the question.
3447000	3448000	You're going to enjoy this question.
3448000	3449000	Because in-
3449000	3451000	Let's not forget the previous question.
3451000	3456000	I'm still trying to come around answering, why did he make a straw man out of Parmenides and Heraklites?
3456000	3457000	Okay, you know what?
3457000	3458000	You're right.
3458000	3459000	Let's do that first.
3459000	3460000	Go ahead.
3460000	3461000	But don't forget it.
3461000	3462000	Nope.
3462000	3465000	No, I got a really good question that's going to follow up.
3465000	3476000	So, so here's the thing in the context of this culture of mimesis of, you know, unreflected imitation and the basically
3476000	3482000	unthinking absorption of traditional cultural values, right?
3482000	3488000	In what had for centuries been an oral culture.
3488000	3499000	These sages like Parmenides, Heraklites, Pythagoras are breaking out of that and they're teaching people to think for themselves.
3499000	3505000	But the people who they're teaching are an extremely minuscule elite.
3505000	3506000	Okay.
3506000	3516000	And by elite, I don't necessarily just mean wealthy people, although that tended to be the class of people in the Pythagorean schools in Sicily, for example.
3516000	3523000	But they were teaching at the very least we can say a very rarefied spiritual elite.
3523000	3544000	And so they had the luxury of engaging in very esoteric manners of expression, very cryptic and profoundly thought provoking formulations of the kind that you find in Heraklites and in Parmenides.
3544000	3548000	And in the school of Pythagoras, I mean, the guy didn't even write down anything.
3548000	3554000	It was, it was, it was, you know, not permitted at his time in his own time to write down his teaching.
3554000	3566000	And he had two grades of followers, at least one of which was in front of the curtain sitting at his feet and the others of which had to sit behind the curtain that separated him from them.
3566000	3569000	So Pythagoras is the original man by man behind the curtain.
3569000	3571000	That's where the expression comes from.
3571000	3572000	Wow.
3572000	3582000	So point being, point being, these esoteric sages were not really changing the society of the time.
3582000	3597000	And in fact, when the Pythagorean order was in danger of reshaping the society of Sicily, when it started to have significant sociopolitical influence, the aristocrats riled up the mob and they set fire to the Pythagorean schools.
3597000	3600000	And this is how Pythagoras ultimately died himself.
3600000	3610000	He either died in the fire or from, you know, wounds that he sustained during the burning of the Pythagorean schools by the mobs of Sicily, who were riled up by aristocrats.
3610000	3626000	So Plato's look, and then of course, Plato sees how his own teacher Socrates is executed by the Democratic Assembly of Athens for provoking people to think for themselves and question authority and question customer tradition.
3626000	3647000	And so Plato realizes that it's not enough to express yourself in this esoteric and cryptic form and convey deep truths by that means the way that Heraclitus and Pythagoras, Heraclitus and Parmenides did.
3647000	3666000	You have to build a theory of knowledge that you can institutionalize in an academy, which then becomes responsible for educating the youth, rather than allowing them to be corrupted by what they're absorbing through Homer, for example.
3666000	3667000	Right.
3667000	3673000	And in point of fact, Plato does set up the first Academy.
3673000	3686000	But, you know, what we have to remember about Plato who sets up the first Academy is that before he met Socrates, he was an aspiring tragic poet.
3686000	3694000	He had written this tragedy that, you know, he was going to submit to a competition in the theater of Dionysus.
3694000	3709000	And the story is that after he heard Socrates talk, he burned his great tragedy in an offering to Prometheus.
3709000	3721000	He calls forth the God of fire and burns his great tragedy that he was going to enter into this competition and all of the rest of the poetry he had written up to that point and decides to become a student of Socrates.
3721000	3745000	Coming from the background of having been a tragic poet, and of course Dionysus is the God associated with tragedy, and then it's reputed that Plato when he died was discovered to have had a copy of Aristophanes' comedies under his pillow, which he slept on every night.
3745000	3746000	Wow.
3746000	3748000	It's perfect to bed with him.
3748000	3768000	And when you look at the symposium toward the end of Plato's symposium, there's this conversation between Aristophanes, who appears as a character in that dialogue, and a representative of comedy, and Agathon, who's a tragedian, and Aristophanes and Agathon after everybody else has fallen to sleep they're all drunk and they're falling to sleep.
3768000	3783000	They're all sprawled all over the floors. These two are the last ones awake. And as the dawn is rising, they're having a conversation about whether there could be a new form of art beyond the binary of tragedy and comedy.
3783000	3803000	And I think that this is what Plato wanted philosophy to be, that he's conceiving a philosophy as a new art form that embraces the best qualities of both the tragic view of the world that you see in like Heraclitus and comedy.
3803000	3805000	In other words,
3805000	3809000	Is this where you get the satires from?
3809000	3811000	They try to merge the two together.
3811000	3813000	Yeah, and okay.
3813000	3827000	In symposium, Alcibiades, who is this scandalous politician and disciple of Socrates, actually people say he was trying to become Socrates's lover.
3827000	3839000	Alcibiades gives this eulogy of Socrates with the main ads all dancing around to the flute tunes of Dionysus. Okay, this is the backdrop.
3839000	3849000	As this Dionysian ritual is taking place and everyone's drinking and they're playing the Dionysian flutes and the main ads are all dancing around.
3849000	3859000	Alcibiades gives us this eulogy of Socrates and he says Socrates is a, he is a trickster.
3859000	3867000	He is a pharmacus, a witch doctor who has brought us a pharmacon.
3867000	3875000	It was snake poison that was used by traditional doctors as a cure. So in the right amount, it's a medicine.
3875000	3885000	In successive doses, it will kill you. And he says he's been subjected to the venom of Socrates's poison and it's driven him mad.
3885000	3896000	And that Socrates deploys all these arguments in an apparently rational manner, but really what he's trying to do is drive a person toward a kind of divine madness.
3896000	3905000	And he admits to having been driven there himself by Socrates. And so we get this, why does Plato present this image of Socrates in Symposium?
3905000	3918000	And why in the same dialogue, does Socrates say that Eros is the only thing that he's ever understood and the only thing that he worships?
3918000	3924000	Socrates says this in Symposium. Excuse me, what happened to the forums?
3924000	3925000	Right.
3925000	3946000	Right. So Diatima, he had this teacher, Socrates had this teacher, Diatima, who according to Plato and how he writes the Symposium, taught Socrates this great mystery of Eros as the ultimate enigma, the ultimate secret, right?
3946000	3963000	You know, divine love, in the sense of the erotic, is somehow the ultimate key to wisdom, right? And essentially it's a Western form of Tantra, okay?
3963000	3964000	And
3964000	3977000	And he lays out how in every, he said, look at the stories of Homer, every time a character is in trouble, Eros comes, he strikes his bow and makes one of these lovely ladies fall in love with the hero and save them.
3977000	3989000	Eros is always, he said Eros, according to Longus from this, from the novel Daphnis and Chloe, Eros has more power than Zeus himself.
3989000	3997000	He has the power over all the elements. That's like, what? What the hell is Socrates talking about?
3997000	4011000	Yeah, and what happened to the forums? So look, if you go back to Plato's Republic, there are some rather cryptic remarks that he makes.
4011000	4020000	This was my question. This was going to be my question because in Plato's Republic, he says, Homer's no good.
4020000	4029000	Homer, no, no, no, no, no, no. Homer has Achilles in Hades crying. That can't be the, we cannot have this.
4029000	4040000	We need a cosmology where the good people go to heaven and experience eternal bliss and the bad people go to Hades, not Achilles going to Hades.
4040000	4049000	And so my question is, is Plato setting up the cosmology of Judeo-Christianity?
4049000	4059000	Okay, so now I was going to go to Republic, but let me just make a brief assignment here that's relevant to how you frame this question.
4059000	4069000	In Phaedo, the death dialogue, the dialogue where Socrates drinks the hemlock and martyrs himself.
4069000	4074000	Socrates' disciples are all around him, his friends, his friends are surrounding him.
4074000	4093000	And he says that he tells them they shouldn't worry because he's going to a place where he's going to be surrounded by all the best men, essentially an afterlife populated by the virtuous.
4093000	4103000	And lays out, as you put it yourself, a kind of prototype for the Christian vision of heaven.
4103000	4113000	And he basically, how is this set up? Let me actually read you the passage because it's quite striking.
4113000	4124000	This friend or disciple of Socrates as Sebes says to him,
4124000	4135000	Probably even in us, there is a little boy who has these childish terrors, try to persuade him not to be afraid of death as though it were a bogey.
4135000	4145000	What you should do, said Socrates, is to say a magic spell over him every day until you have charmed his fears away.
4145000	4153000	But Socrates said, Simeos, where shall we find a magician who understands these spells now that you are leaving us?
4153000	4163000	Okay, that's when they're imploring him to console them about his dying, right?
4163000	4170000	To reassure them that he's going to a better place and that they shouldn't, you know, excessively mourn his death.
4170000	4176000	And so then Socrates comes back with, he comes back with, quote,
4176000	4186000	If I did not expect to enter the company first of otherwise than good gods and secondly of men now dead who are better than those who are in this world now,
4186000	4190000	it is true that it would be unjust for me not to grieve at death.
4190000	4196000	As it is, you can be assured that I expect to find myself among good men.
4196000	4206000	While I would not particularly insist on this, I assure you that I could commit myself upon this point if I could upon anything.
4206000	4208000	One more time.
4208000	4219000	While I would not particularly insist on this, I assure you that I could commit myself upon this point if I could upon anything, unquote.
4219000	4220000	All right.
4220000	4222000	This is a disaster.
4222000	4224000	And I'm going to tell you why.
4224000	4233000	First of all, in the same dialogue, Phaedo, this is these quotes were from Phaedo in the same dialogue.
4233000	4244000	Socrates says, Plato, of course, in the mouth of Socrates says that we can't have any true knowledge while we're inside the body.
4244000	4253000	That we can only have approximate knowledge and that true knowledge can only be attained through total freedom from the senses.
4253000	4270000	Objective absolute knowledge can only be attained when our mind has been freed from our body and it's distorted perception of things and we're able to perceive sort of like as if from the vantage point of the realm of forms.
4270000	4272000	Okay.
4272000	4285000	But he's presenting a vision of the afterlife where that's not the case. When he wants to reassure his disciples, he's presenting like what becomes the classic sensuous afterlife of, let's say, Christianity.
4285000	4286000	My faith, right.
4286000	4287000	My faith.
4287000	4297000	And that's, in that state, you have what's called a soma pneumaticon. That's what the Greeks called this, the spectral body, soma pneumaticon.
4297000	4302000	It is a world where you still have perception and you still have sensations even.
4302000	4315000	Now, here's a further problem. This heavenly afterlife that he presents us with in Phaedo contradicts what he writes in Republic in the myth of error.
4315000	4332000	In the myth of the story of this soldier error myth of myth is not the right word in this tale of error in Republic were presented with basically like what we call today an NDE a near death experience account where this guy air sort of dies and lives to tell the
4332000	4344000	tale comes back and lives to tell the tale of what the afterlife is like what is the transition between death and rebirth life because of course Plato argues in favor of reincarnation.
4344000	4357000	The or the orifics use this as the secret, the secret knowledge of what to do when you go to Hades and how to reincarnate the right way and keep your memory.
4357000	4358000	Yes.
4358000	4371000	Plato studied all these things, right? So, but the thing is this, the story of error portrays a kind of afterlife transition between death and rebirth.
4371000	4385000	That's actually very similar to what we see in the Tibetan book of the dead, the Mahayana Buddhist account of the bardo state, and it is not the same as what Plato says to reassure his disciples in the Phaedo.
4385000	4387000	They conflict with each other.
4387000	4388000	Absolutely.
4388000	4401000	And the account of the Phaedo conflicts with what Plato says about knowledge only being possible once we free our mind entirely from the senses, because the bardo state or the state of the soma pneumaticon is still a sensuous state.
4401000	4403000	And so this stuff doesn't make sense.
4403000	4404000	Okay.
4404000	4405000	No.
4405000	4406000	And the guy obviously not a moron.
4406000	4408000	He's not contradicting himself.
4408000	4413000	He's saying these apparently contradictory things for a reason.
4413000	4415000	Let me present one more.
4415000	4416000	Yeah, no.
4416000	4424000	And everything you're saying is this is what I've been wondering about Plato, since I've been reading about it, like what is going on with Plato.
4424000	4426000	And it seems that he's changing.
4426000	4432000	He wants to change the norms of what people think about reality and the afterlife.
4432000	4433000	Go ahead.
4433000	4442000	So one more point that's relevant to this death scene to, you know, the account that we get in Phaedo of Socrates's last days.
4442000	4450000	His disciples show up and they see him writing poems based on Aesop's fables.
4450000	4456000	These animal stories, the animal stories with the moral about donkeys and things.
4456000	4457000	Yeah.
4457000	4465000	And he's sitting there in his last days writing poems based on Aesop's fables and they ask him basically like, what are you smoking?
4465000	4466000	Like what?
4466000	4468000	Have you lost your mind, Socrates?
4468000	4469000	Like what are you doing, man?
4469000	4471000	This is how you're spending your last days.
4471000	4474000	And this is what Socrates says in reply.
4474000	4477000	He says, quote.
4477000	4479000	Now let's keep in mind, right?
4479000	4486000	Now this is the Plato who's writing this is the guy who in Republic has claimed that the poets should be banned.
4486000	4487000	Right.
4488000	4501000	Because they're corrupting the morals of the youth and he thinks there should be very narrow like limits on like what kind of poetic compositions there are for the sake of edification and inculcation of virtue in the.
4501000	4504000	This is the guy who's writing what I'm about to read.
4504000	4512000	He goes, Socrates says to his disciples who are wondering if he's lost his marbles, versifying Aesop quote.
4512000	4517000	I did not compose the poetry to rival either Evanus or his poetry.
4517000	4528000	I did it in the attempt to discover the meaning of certain dreams and to clear my conscience in case this was the art which I had been told to practice.
4528000	4538000	It's like this, you see, in the course of my life, I've often had the same dream appearing in different forms at different times, but always saying the same thing.
4538000	4551000	Socrates practice and cultivate music, the arts in the sense of poetry, music, Socrates make music.
4551000	4558000	In the past, I used to think that it was impelling and exhorting me to do what I was actually doing.
4558000	4565000	I mean that the dream like a spectator encouraging a runner in a race was urging me on to do what I was doing already.
4565000	4571000	That is practicing the arts because philosophy is the greatest of the arts and I was practicing it.
4571000	4581000	But when my trial had taken place and this God's festival was delaying my execution, I decided that in case it should be this popular form of art.
4581000	4584000	That the dream intended me to practice.
4584000	4587000	I ought to compose and not disobey.
4587000	4591000	I reflected that a poet ought to work on stories, not discourses.
4591000	4593000	And I was no story writer.
4593000	4597000	So it was the stories that I knew and had handy which I versified.
4597000	4604000	Asops, the first ones that occurred to me.
4604000	4607000	Okay, this is a diabolical writer.
4607000	4608000	Yeah.
4608000	4612000	What is he telling us here?
4612000	4630000	He's telling us something about the relationship between the Dionysian essence of the poetic and the kind of art that Plato sought to produce in his youth as a tragedian on the one hand.
4630000	4641000	And the Apollonian rationalism of what becomes Plato's philosophical project on the other hand as exemplified by the theory of forms.
4642000	4648000	And the same Socrates who's telling us this ridiculous and unbelievable thing.
4648000	4657000	Namely that, oops, maybe I was supposed to like, versify children's stories and animal fables instead of doing philosophy.
4657000	4663000	Maybe that's what this voice, this daemon was telling me all my life that I should make music.
4664000	4673000	Right. And I did, I wasted my whole life. So I make up for it by making poems of, you know, animal fables that I read in childhood.
4673000	4683000	No, no. So this ridiculous story is really another way that Plato is signaling the fact that there's an esoteric and unwritten doctrine here.
4683000	4691000	That when Socrates says in symposium, the only thing I've ever understood and that I've devoted myself to worship in life is Eros.
4691000	4695000	Again, Dionysian power, right.
4695000	4712000	And so now where I was going to go before, and I think there's a good time to loop back around to it, is these passages in Republic where Plato is comparing the forms to the diagrams drawn by geometers.
4713000	4721000	And so look, according to the conventional understanding of the theory of forms, you obviously can't see forms, right.
4721000	4734000	So you can, no matter how perfect the circle you draw is, it's not a representation of the form of the circle, nor is a perfect triangle, the form of the triangle, right.
4734000	4748000	The geometric diagrams that are drawn on blackboards or whatever, or these days that are formulated by computer code are not the form of that geometrical object.
4748000	4757000	I mean, if you zoom in enough on what appears to be a perfect triangle generated by a computer, it's going to pixelate at some point.
4757000	4772000	Okay, even if you were to print out what appears to be a perfect triangle using individual atoms, right, in molecular nanotechnology, if you use an electron microscope, it's going to also pixelate.
4772000	4783000	So nothing we can craft in this world will represent the perfect circle or the perfect triangle or the perfect square or whatever, right.
4783000	4786000	Isn't that debunked, you know?
4786000	4794000	Well, no, but here's the thing, right, Plato claims that the forms exist in this invisible realm, right, that they're beyond the physical world.
4794000	4797000	But here's the thing, I don't think he really believes that.
4797000	4798000	No, me neither.
4798000	4809000	There are passages in Republic where he compares the invisible forms to the diagrams drawn by geometers.
4809000	4813000	Okay, try to grasp this point, just a little bit of a subtle point.
4813000	4818000	So the diagrams drawn by geometers can never represent forms.
4818000	4823000	They're infinite, they're eternal, they exist in this realm beyond the physical world.
4823000	4834000	So Plato shouldn't be comparing forms, the real forms, the transcendental forms, to the diagrams drawn by geometers, but he does do this.
4834000	4836000	He does do this in Republic.
4836000	4838000	I'll give you the passage in a minute.
4838000	4840000	Let me lay it out.
4840000	4862000	And what he says is that these forms are meant, like the diagrams used by geometers, to act as step ladders in order to help us intellectually grasp or spiritually grasp with our mind's eye, the form of the good.
4862000	4890000	So all the other forms are simply step ladders or useful tools like geometers diagrams to help us grasp the form of the good, the way that geometers use the drawing of a circle on a board to help someone understand what a circle is as an abstract definition.
4890000	4905000	And with equal significance, Plato says, I was afraid that if I, and he said, okay, so that was Republic, what I just laid out there, and I'll give you the passage numbers in a minute.
4905000	4918000	And then in Phaedo, he says that I was afraid that if I contemplated the form of the good directly, I would go blind the way someone who looks into the sun does.
4918000	4928000	And so I took refuge in the realm of ideas, or and so I took recourse to ideas, meaning the forms.
4928000	4929000	Right.
4929000	4933000	So what are these forms then?
4933000	4952000	Are they constructs that are meant to help you not go blind intellectually and spiritually? And what's the relationship between that looking straight into the sun and the madness that Plato talks about in Phaedrus and that
4952000	4960000	Alcibiades accuses Socrates of having driven him to in symposium, the divine madness.
4960000	4961000	Okay.
4961000	4969000	So let me just take a moment to give some references here.
4969000	4987000	Geometers diagrams that I was talking about, that's in Republic 510 to 511c, 510c to 511c, where he's saying that all the other forms are there only so that you can contemplate the form of the good, and they're like tools, they're like geometers diagrams.
4987000	5006000	And then the passage where he says that he was afraid he'd go blind by staring straight into the sun if he contemplated the form of the good directly, that's in Phaedo 99d to 100a, Phaedo 99d to 100a.
5006000	5014000	Specifically he says, quote, I thought that in the contemplation of true existence, I ought to be careful that I did not lose the eye of my soul.
5014000	5025000	People may injure their bodily eye by observing and gazing on the sun during an eclipse, unless they take the precaution of only looking at the image reflected in the water, or in some analogous medium.
5025000	5037000	I was afraid that my soul might be blinded altogether if I looked at things with my eyes, and I thought that I had better have recourse to the world of idea and seek there the truth of things.
5037000	5043000	Okay, the world of idea, meaning the realm of forms.
5043000	5051000	Now I want to look at two really important letters that Plato wrote.
5051000	5056000	One is the seventh letter.
5056000	5060000	These are, they're referred to as Plato's epistles, the letters that Plato wrote to various people.
5060000	5074000	One is the seventh letter, and one is the second letter, and significantly the second letter, Plato's second letter, is a letter that he wrote to Dionysus II of Syracuse.
5074000	5078000	Oh my God, this is going to lead up to another good question, go ahead.
5079000	5082000	Doesn't he try to kill Plato later? Plutarch writes a story.
5082000	5089000	It's one of the tyrants of Sicily or Syracuse tries to kill Plato, and then Plato had to get out of there by the squire.
5089000	5094000	Yes, I thought you said sure. No, yes, kill. No, no, no. It's a disaster.
5095000	5105000	So, okay, so Plato, this is also a really important point to grasp in terms of the philosopher living his ideas.
5105000	5113000	The philosopher, as someone who doesn't just sit in an ivory tower but wants to change the world, okay, wants his ideas to reshape society.
5113000	5119000	Plato attempted to implement his conception of the ideal society.
5119000	5136000	He went to Syracuse in contemporary Italy, southern Italy, and he attempted through a follower of his in the court of Dionysus the Elder, Dionysus I.
5136000	5149000	A guy named Dion, who was part of the family of Dionysus, was a follower of Plato, and this Dion gave him basically Plato a foothold in the royal court of Syracuse.
5149000	5166000	And Plato tried to influence the son of Dionysus to not be a tyrant like his father and basically mold him into the type of philosopher king that he portrays in Republic.
5166000	5178000	And long story short, Dionysus gets rubbed the wrong way by this and his courtiers convince him that Plato is out to wreck the conservative traditional society of Syracuse.
5178000	5183000	And he has Plato sold into slavery.
5183000	5191000	And some rich guy bails Plato out basically and buys his freedom and Plato escapes back to Athens.
5191000	5207000	Then Dionysus dies, Dionysus I dies, and Dionysus II comes to power and Dion, who is his uncle, Dion is the uncle of Dionysus II, he winds up with more influence.
5207000	5222000	He winds up with more influence at court. And so he basically implores Plato to come back and try again. And Plato comes back and he tries again now to shape Dionysus II, a monarch who's actually on the throne.
5222000	5232000	And the second letter is a letter to this Dionysus II of Syracuse, which Plato writes to him after Plato is forced to flee again.
5232000	5237000	And so Plato is forced, you know, at the risk of his life to flee for a second time.
5237000	5243000	Yeah, Soothark says that I think it was the second Dionysus who wanted to kill Plato and almost did, was very close to doing it.
5243000	5260000	Yes. And then, get this, he repents at some years later, Dionysus II has a change of heart, and he convinces Dion to beg Plato to come back for a third time to Syracuse.
5260000	5267000	You know, he agrees he's gonna let Plato basically experiment in Syracuse with his ideas for social engineering and so forth.
5267000	5282000	And it ends badly for a third time. And the third time, as Dionysus II basically, you know, conspires to execute both Plato and Dion.
5282000	5293000	Dion leads a coup d'etat against the government of his nephew and tries to take power directly, basically as a representative of Plato's philosophical project.
5293000	5300000	And Dion is killed in the process and Plato has to escape Syracuse, you know, for the third time. Right.
5300000	5304000	So he, he, this is very important.
5304000	5309000	This is the same geographical location where Parminides and Pythagoras and all these guys are.
5309000	5320000	So this is this is a huge stick for what for the Western, the Western civilization, like all these events are shaping the world today in a weird way in the rival effect way. Yeah.
5320000	5328000	But no, this is really important in terms of understanding the concept of the noble lie.
5328000	5339000	This is an idea that that Plato brings up in, I'm going to come back to the letters I know we're going on a tangent but it's still relevant to setting this up.
5339000	5349000	What Plato's misadventure in Syracuse is very important to understanding the noble lie as an applicable concept.
5349000	5365000	Before 14 to 415 in Republic, Plato introduces this idea of an ally that would be noble, a deception that would be, you know, that would be of merit and would have, you know, that would be virtuous a virtuous deception.
5365000	5366000	Okay.
5366000	5371000	He introduces this idea at 414 to 415.
5371000	5388000	This is a mix of the so called myth of metals where he's saying that, you know, we have this tripartite society with the guardians or the philosopher rulers at the top, the military class of basically, you know, noble minded nights in the middle,
5388000	5405000	the general citizenry of farmers and business people in the third tier. And he's saying that as part of getting people to accept this type of structure in society, which is of course a meritocratic structure because people are educated.
5405000	5421000	They all receive the same general education and it's throughout the course of their education that it's determined which class of society they belong in. But as part of getting people to accept this kind of meritocratic tripartite class division of society will inculcate them from
5421000	5426000	childhood with the myth that the gods have mixed one or another metal into their soul.
5426000	5443000	And the philosopher rulers have gold mixed into their soul. The noble warrior cast has silver mixed into its soul and the general populace of farmers and merchants have grown.
5443000	5462000	And so that's the context in which introduced. So in other words, this is bullshit. Okay, it's a lie. It's some myth, but children should be brought up with this myth because it's constructive to reinforcing what is actually a noble attempt to replace the arbitrary
5462000	5479000	aristocracy and kind of quasi feudal society of the time with a meritocratic system right so it's serving to actually reward individuals for their merit as expressed through their performance in the course of their education.
5479000	5496000	So that's what makes it a noble lie. And then this noble lie comes up two more times. Once in the context of how marriages will be set up with the view to eugenic breeding.
5496000	5517000	So, okay, so in the Republic, the philosopher rulers and the military class are all married to each other. They have kind of a common marriage. It's like a basically free love. Okay, people and the men and women in the ruling class, and the men and women who serve as soldiers basically have a communal life where
5517000	5533000	they're all sleeping with one another. The general populace though have, you know, have marriages and have families, but the marriages are arranged with a view to eugenic breeding in other words the people with the best genes should be the ones who get together in order to produce
5533000	5544000	one free from diseases and deformities and so forth and the brightest children and so forth. Plato is the father of the concept of eugenics, but he says to make this go down easier.
5544000	5556000	We'll tell the general populace that like, you know, we're going to hold certain lotteries that determine who they get to marry what group of people are their eligible mates.
5556000	5571000	And this is the second application of the noble lie in service of the eugenic breeding program. The third and final example of the noble lie is the most important though, and the most relevant to our general conversation.
5571000	5582000	And that's where Plato says, again, going back to his attack on Homer, and how all the sadism and brutality in the Iliad, for example, is deleterious to the development of the youth.
5582000	5597000	Plato says that, look, these religious myths that we have are ancient and we don't know whether what they're depicting is something that ever really took place.
5597000	5623000	We have little knowledge of vast antiquity. And so we should spin these myths. We should rewrite them in ways that are more constructive to the development of the youth and frame a religion that portrays gods and goddesses and so forth in a way that will serve as an ethical example for the children brought up with this religion.
5623000	5640000	And the guardians, the philosopher rulers don't have to believe in this religion. It's not true, but it's constructive for developing a society oriented toward actual discovery of the truth.
5640000	5643000	In other words, a society where science can flourish.
5644000	5661000	Okay, so now you got to understand, we're dealing now with an incredibly duplicitous person. This person is proposing restructuring the entire religion of the society based on lies and creating a false religion which the rulers themselves won't believe in, but which they'll get the majority of the population to believe in,
5661000	5683000	because that type of religion that I don't want to call it a cult, will actually foster scientific thinking in the long run, and will be more conducive to the development of reflective, critical and strong individuals, which seems a little paradoxical, right?
5683000	5698000	But it's the idea that you have to force people to be free. And on the way to doing that, on the way to forcing people to think for themselves, you need to give them certain constructive fables, myths, right?
5698000	5713000	And ideas that may be false, but that will be thought provoking and that will be, that will cultivate virtue in them. Okay.
5713000	5725000	So, so these are the different, you know, examples of the use of the noble lie and, as I said at the beginning, what I'm suggesting is that this entire theory of forms is itself a noble lie.
5725000	5740000	And to get back to that argument, right, we were talking about, you know, the sun, which if you stare straight at, and by the way, the metaphor of a sun that never sets is at the heart of the writings of Heraclitus.
5740000	5753000	So I think the Plato is getting the simile of the sun straight from out of his years as a Heraclitian in his youth. And in the context of this whole discussion of how,
5753000	5768000	unless you're ready for it, contemplating the good, the form of the good can blind you intellectually, it can drive you mad spiritually, right? And so you need something like the forms as a sort of safety net on the way to that.
5768000	5781000	In the context of all of that, let me read what Plato says in some key passages of these two letters, the seventh letter and the second letter, the one to Dionysus of Syracuse.
5781000	5786000	In the seventh letter, Plato writes,
5786000	5801000	This much at any rate I can affirm about any present or future writers who pretend to knowledge of the matters with which I concern myself, whether they claim to have been taught by me or by a third party, or to have discovered the truth for themselves.
5801000	5813000	In my judgment, it is impossible that they should have any understanding of the subject. No treatise by me concerning it exists or ever will exist.
5813000	5827000	If I thought that any adequate spoken or written account could be given to the world at large, what more glorious life work could I have undertaken than to put into writing what would be of great benefit to mankind and to bring the nature of reality to light for all to see.
5827000	5839000	But I do not think that the attempt to put these matters into words would be to men's advantage, except to those few who can find out the truth for themselves with a little guidance.
5839000	5849000	That is why any students of serious realities will shrink from making truth the helpless object of men's ill will by committing it to writing.
5849000	5869000	In a word, the conclusion to be drawn is this, when one sees a written composition, whether it be on law by a legislator or on any other subject, one can be sure if the writer, if the writer is a serious man, that his book does not represent his most serious thoughts.
5869000	5874000	They remain stored up in the noblest region of his personality.
5875000	5884000	And now one short passage from the second letter, his letter to Dionysus II of Syracuse.
5884000	5895000	Quote, take precautions, lest this teaching ever be disclosed among untrained people. It is impossible for what is written not to be disclosed.
5895000	5906000	That is the reason why I have never written anything about these things and why there is not and will not be any written work of Plato's own.
5906000	5913000	Farewell and believe. Read this letter now at once many times and burn it.
5913000	5916000	Wow.
5916000	5921000	So Plato never wrote his philosophy.
5921000	5934000	All these writings we have, the most voluminous intellectual work that survived the destruction of the Library of Alexandria and so forth, the corpus of Plato does not represent the teaching of Plato.
5934000	5938000	What Plato wrote were plays.
5938000	5955000	He was a tragedian. He was a trained playwright. Remember, he burned his plays when he met Socrates. He torched them and dedicated the burning of his plays to Prometheus and called for the God of Fire to inspire him in his next endeavor, which is his philosophical project.
5955000	5983000	But he did that at the theater of Dionysus and as someone who's coming from out of the Dionysian tragic poetic tradition, a tradition of ecstasy, of mystical frenzy, right, of the contemplation of beauty as the key to understanding the nature of the divine.
5983000	5997000	And so I think that Plato's unwritten doctrine, which he tells us exists, right, in the seventh letter and in the second letter, he says his true teaching remains unwritten.
5997000	6006000	So meaning what meaning we have to read between the lines of the dialogues that we want to understand, you know, what Plato actually thought.
6006000	6022000	And we have to read between the lines to understand what the hell Plato was trying to do in Syracuse or why Plato thought that noble lies needed to be employed for the sake of reshaping society beneficent.
6022000	6032000	Okay, so this is what I argue in the pharmacon artist that Plato and of course the name of that essay is a play on words right pharmacon, it's the snake poison.
6032000	6045000	That's also a medicine in the right dose, which is what Socrates is accused of dispensing is being accused of being a pharmacus. But obviously my title the pharmacon artist has con artist in it.
6045000	6048000	Oh, nice, nice.
6048000	6057000	He's a, and in a way I mean Alcibiades accuses Socrates of being a con man in symposium. Why would Plato write that.
6057000	6074000	He builds up this character, this great tragic martyr, seeker of truth in light, and he allows Alcibiades he gives him the stage with the main ads playing the Dionysian flute tunes in symposium to portray Socrates as a kind of
6075000	6093000	trickster con man, you know, basically magician, which doctor, right, because Plato is telling us something about himself, and who and what he really is, what he's up to.
6093000	6094000	Wow.
6094000	6112000	Now, when Plato talks about how what you want for a society is that you want them to think that their laws are not only divinely from God, but that they're most ancient and they go back to the beginning of time.
6112000	6117000	And when you weigh this up with what is being said.
6117000	6127000	And for example, the Old Testament, and there are there are some people who now are theorizing that the Septuagint came first, and the Hebrews came, regardless if that's true or not.
6127000	6142000	Even if it's even if it's not true, there could be the other and the other side that could be that this Old Testament myth fits so well with what Plato envisioned that the people in Alexandria said this is let's put this together as this Septuagint.
6142000	6157000	That's how Lamaic Empire, that is Greek, obviously, and they have the libraries and they have Plato's writings. Are they putting together what becomes the myth of the Western civilization as we know it Judeo Christianity.
6157000	6161000	That's the question I think is Plato the one who checks this.
6161000	6174000	I don't know. I don't know if you realize the profundity and
6174000	6181000	terror implicit in the question that you just framed. I mean,
6181000	6194000	this is perhaps the single most disturbing question that we could grapple with about the history of Western civilization and by extension the entire world has been conquered and dominated by the West.
6194000	6216000	Let me just stop for a second. All the hours of us talking as leading up to this question right here. It literally has been and this is this is like the question that Plato construct what we what became the myth of the West, the religion of the Western civilization as we know it, you know, universal church.
6216000	6219000	So, okay.
6219000	6237000	I answered this question, not in the pharmacon artist, although you know I'm developing an embryonic phase of it there I'm planting the seeds for it there, but I answered this question of yours at the heart of Iranian Leviathan.
6237000	6252000	In the series of chapters that goes from the one I mentioned earlier Emperor of noble lies, where I'm portraying Darius the Great as a noble liar in the style of the Platonic philosopher King, all the way through.
6253000	6270000	Hassan Sabah, the leader of the Order of Assassins at Alamut Fortress, claiming that nothing is true and everything is permitted, and that the entire war on with it so not its Sharia law was a noble lie.
6270000	6285000	Okay, in this series of chapters in Iranian Leviathan, I basic which includes a treatment of the origin of the Old Testament.
6285000	6299000	You're the influence of Mithraists, who were the patrons of Jewish Pharisees that set up the Second Temple State after Cyrus and Darius rebuilt the Temple of Solomon.
6299000	6301000	Okay, I have a whole treatment of that.
6301000	6306000	That chapter is comically titled Tekel Tekel Manish Ekel.
6306000	6311000	And it's about the relationship between the Persians and the Jews.
6311000	6314000	And how Judaism was created and why.
6314000	6320000	And you also have so many commonalities between the Mithraic Orders and the early Christians.
6320000	6321000	So much.
6321000	6323000	They're even using the same worship places.
6323000	6324000	Right.
6324000	6329000	So now, look, this is like a whole other conversation.
6329000	6330000	This could be, yeah.
6330000	6331000	Okay.
6331000	6342000	But in a nutshell, the answer to your question is that a case can be made
6342000	6355000	that people who understood very well what Plato's esoteric project was and people who knew how to deploy, noble lies in the most sophisticated way on the highest level or at the deepest level.
6355000	6358000	If you want to put it that way.
6358000	6374000	He engineered the Abrahamic revelation, the biblical religion as a catalyst for the transformation of society.
6374000	6386000	But the catalyst was not intended to get people to become good Jews or later good Christians or even later good Muslims.
6386000	6393000	The catalyst was intended to get people to go to the devil.
6393000	6407000	The purpose of the catalyst was to confront people with an image of divinity that ought to be rejected and resisted by the conscience of the human individual.
6407000	6408000	Wow.
6408000	6409000	It was a pharmacon.
6409000	6414000	Remember, pharmacon, it's poison.
6414000	6418000	If you don't take to it the right way, it will kill you.
6418000	6422000	It's a snake bite, like the snake in the garden of Eden.
6422000	6425000	Why would you tell a story like that, by the way?
6425000	6436000	If your point is to get people to believe in Yahweh, why do you even have the whole narrative of the serpent offering the fruit of the tree of knowledge to Adamic man?
6436000	6437000	Why?
6437000	6444000	Why even include the story about the fallen angels and how they taught humanity to rebel against the Elohim?
6444000	6447000	Why even have the Tower of Babel in there?
6447000	6457000	I mean, if you just want to instill paternalistic, patriarchal, collectivistic obedience into a society right like Confucius,
6457000	6462000	don't tell us about this serpent and about these rebel angels and about this Tower of Babel.
6462000	6464000	What are you trying to do here?
6464000	6466000	Instigate rebellion.
6466000	6470000	Give people models of challenging authority.
6470000	6472000	That's very Plato.
6472000	6473000	Wow.
6473000	6488000	My view is very radically divergent from the common understanding of the relationship between both Christian scholasticism and Plato,
6488000	6501000	and then later Islamic scholasticism and Plato, because Plato was as important to the medieval Muslim thinkers as he was to the Catholic scholastics.
6501000	6509000	Conventionally, it's believed, and even Nietzsche subscribed to this idea, that Christianity is Platonism for the masses,
6509000	6529000	and that the scholastics Aquinas before him, Augustine and so on and so forth, they basically adapted elements of Plato into aspects of the Christian faith by making them more amenable to a popular understanding.
6529000	6540000	But what you just did is you just answered the question that scholars have been dumbfounded by is that is the closer we get to the origins of Christianity,
6540000	6548000	the closer we get to the beginning, the more diverse it is, the more nostics there are, the more opposing there are.
6548000	6554000	There are people who literally say that Yahweh is evil and that Cain was good because he wasn't offering blood sacrifices.
6554000	6563000	They start off that way. They don't become that way later on. They start off that way, because you're seeing the duality within the stories.
6563000	6566000	You choose a side. You're choosing a side.
6566000	6568000	And so I believe it's a travesty.
6568000	6569000	You're right, dude.
6569000	6576000	And the Christian scholastics took to frame Plato as quote, a virtuous pagan, unquote.
6576000	6579000	Like, he would have been a Christian if he were alive today.
6579000	6581000	No, no.
6581000	6587000	Plato is out to create the devil.
6587000	6589000	That's his aim.
6589000	6604000	Plato wants to, he wants to basically promulgate Diabolane, what the Greeks call Diabolane, a dynamic tension, a throwing through of opposites.
6604000	6607000	This is what his dialectical method is about.
6607000	6617000	It's why his dialogue, it's why he wrote dialogues and it's why his writings are structured in the conversational and oppositional way that they are.
6617000	6622000	Because he wants people to set positions against one another.
6622000	6634000	He assumes all kinds of positions through the mouth of Socrates that he himself doesn't subscribe to and that over the course of his corpus contradict each other.
6634000	6642000	And he does that for the sake of provoking insight and catalyzing independent thinking.
6642000	6647000	He's literally separating goats from sheep in a sense.
6647000	6648000	Exactly.
6648000	6649000	Here's the story.
6649000	6653000	However you interpret this will determine if you're one of these types.
6653000	6655000	That's exactly it.
6655000	6657000	And in fact...
6657000	6660000	It's genius. It really is.
6660000	6669000	In fact, he comes close to saying this, you know, in the seventh letter that you can't get philosophy from some treatise.
6669000	6680000	That it's not like, you know, philosophy is not about subscribing to a worldview that some guy has written down in a treatise.
6680000	6689000	You have to have direct experiential knowledge of certain things about the nature of reality.
6689000	6697000	And you're only going to get that in dialogue and in a life in common, he says, with others also devoted to seeking the truth.
6697000	6702000	So Plato has this unwritten doctrine.
6702000	6712000	And this unwritten doctrine deploys all kinds of noble lies up to and including, I believe, the theory of forms.
6712000	6717000	And to my mind, Plato doesn't subscribe to the objective existence of these forms.
6717000	6729000	They're useful constructs to promote the rise of rational thought of the kind that eventually becomes scientific analysis.
6729000	6731000	Wow.
6731000	6740000	Really, Plato, really, Plato sees the world more like Heraclitus saw it.
6740000	6743000	That is amazing.
6743000	6751000	I have no... I don't even know what... I think I want to leave it right there because that's perfect.
6751000	6754000	That leaves the viewer with something to think about.
6754000	6766000	And because I think when we stick to the way we started off with talking about the Mithraist and how their religion sort of is this religion that influences all areas of the world and all religious aspects.
6766000	6768000	And obviously, Zoroaster comes along.
6768000	6774000	He transforms this movement and he shapes philosophy of the West.
6774000	6777000	And then we had this divide happening.
6777000	6779000	There's people looking at gods in different ways.
6779000	6781000	And which side do we devote ourselves to?
6781000	6786000	Plato comes along and answers that question in an inverse way.
6786000	6790000	Very secretive, very esoteric, but he does it.
6790000	6792000	That's it.
6792000	6794000	Absolutely.
6794000	6797000	And I think the takeaway is what you said as you put it.
6797000	6808000	His intention was to separate the goats from the sheep to find a way to basically pass society through that filter
6808000	6812000	and to test people's metal.
6812000	6814000	That's where the fricking question comes from, right?
6814000	6816000	It's the myth of the metals.
6816000	6824000	And our expression to test someone's metal comes from the myth of the metals, ultimately, to see what someone's made of.
6824000	6826000	What are you made of?
6826000	6827000	Right?
6827000	6836000	By the way, just as a nice concluding note, that's very much the question in Christopher Nolan's film, The Dark Knight,
6836000	6838000	which I think is the greatest of the Batman films.
6838000	6840000	Yes, it is.
6840000	6842000	What are you made of?
6842000	6844000	That's what that film turns around.
6844000	6849000	But that film also turns around the noble lie, the whole films about the noble lie.
6849000	6850000	Yeah.
6850000	6856000	But Batman as the guardian of Gotham, the philosopher king, the guardian of Gotham,
6856000	6865000	is forced to lie to the entire populace to take the blame for the murders committed by Harvey Dent,
6865000	6873000	so that Harvey Dent or Two-Face can retain his image as the white knight of Gotham.
6873000	6882000	Because if people were to know that this district attorney, champion of justice and hero fighting against corruption,
6882000	6888000	that he was driven by the Joker into becoming Two-Face and committing all these murders,
6888000	6892000	if people were to see Harvey Dent in that light, they would lose faith.
6892000	6895000	And, you know, it would unleash anarchy and chaos in the city.
6895000	6905000	And so the Joker, the trickster, forces Batman to become a noble liar in the guise of being the guardian of Gotham.
6905000	6907000	But yeah, what does that film turn around?
6907000	6914000	The idea of testing someone's metal, of asking, hammering someone the way Batman is hammered by the Joker,
6914000	6917000	and of asking them the question, what are you made of?
6917000	6919000	Show your face.
6919000	6921000	The one under the mask.
6921000	6925000	Plato wore masks throughout his entire philosophical career.
6925000	6932000	All of these characters in these dialogues are one or another mask of Plato, not just Socrates.
6932000	6941000	But the conversation we've been having is really ultimately about the face underneath those masks that Plato wore.
6941000	6945000	Wow. That is just phenomenal.
6945000	6949000	And I'm sure we will think of another thing to discuss in a future date.
6949000	6957000	But as of now, I think this completes this four-part series in the, what is behind Western esotericism,
6957000	6964000	and where does it come from, and where, how does it end up on Plato's lap for him to make their choice?
6964000	6966000	And it's like an IQ test.
6966000	6968000	He's like giving the world an IQ test.
6968000	6969000	Here you go.
6969000	6970000	Here's, take it or leave it.
6970000	6971000	Let's see where you're at.
6971000	6972000	Let's see how you interpret this.
6972000	6975000	And a test of character on ethos.
6975000	6977000	Test of ethos, right?
6977000	6984000	Because who within ethos would ever worship Zeus or Yahweh?
6984000	6985000	Yeah.
6985000	6986000	You don't have to be a genius, right?
6986000	6991000	I mean, in Plato's ideal state in the Republic, you have the philosopher,
6991000	6996000	but then the warrior cast, the warrior cast, they're in the positions that they are because they're virtuous.
6996000	6997000	They're noble.
6997000	7000000	It's why they're entrusted with a weaponry to protect society.
7000000	7004000	They're not geniuses, the people in the warrior cast, but they do have ethos.
7004000	7006000	Ethos defines them.
7006000	7012000	And so those people are not, you know, individuals who would worship a Zeus or Yahweh.
7012000	7013000	Right.
7013000	7014000	Yeah.
7014000	7020000	And that, and it's so geniusly gives them something to, to go to battle for.
7020000	7021000	Yeah.
7021000	7022000	So it helps.
7022000	7023000	It helps out.
7023000	7024000	And that's, it's so late.
7024000	7029000	It has so many different dimensions of playing the, what do you call it?
7029000	7030000	The puppet with the strings?
7030000	7035000	Like he's got so many puppets on different strings all by one person on top.
7035000	7038000	But they're all, they're all doing different things, different purposes.
7038000	7039000	It's really,
7039000	7048000	you know, as a really, as a last point, Neil, let me just say that people should think of my philosophical project in these terms.
7048000	7049000	Okay.
7049000	7052000	I learned from Plato.
7052000	7059000	I mean, people, a lot of people have framed me as a Nietzschean or something or a Heideggerian or first of all, I don't belong to any of these schools of philosophy.
7059000	7061000	I have my own philosophical project.
7061000	7067000	When I say I learned from Plato, I mean, I really learned from Plato.
7067000	7070000	My work is in the style of Plato.
7070000	7082000	My project is very much an esoteric project in the sense of Plato's esoteric and unwritten doctrine.
7082000	7084000	Well, I have links in the description.
7084000	7087000	Where else can they, what do you have anything coming up?
7087000	7089000	Any thing you want to promote?
7089000	7092000	Just for now, I am always writing a new book.
7092000	7094000	So I'm in the process of doing that right now.
7094000	7100000	But for now, let's just link in particular my YouTube, the Prometheism YouTube.
7100000	7106000	So that's the, you know, where people can remain most up to date with my work.
7106000	7109000	I'm showing it on the screen right now.
7109000	7110000	Go hit that subscribe button.
7110000	7112000	Links in the description.
7112000	7115000	And you have just attained trunosis.
7118000	7121000	You have just attained trunosis.
7123000	7127000	The demiurge has no power over you.
