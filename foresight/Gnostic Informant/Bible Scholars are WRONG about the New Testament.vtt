WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.160
So, how do people even get jobs in this field?

00:03.160 --> 00:08.480
You could think, okay, is it because they're skilled at deconstructing the Christian religion?

00:08.480 --> 00:09.980
I know.

00:09.980 --> 00:15.720
It's in service to largely the academic world that we call New Testament studies is in

00:15.720 --> 00:19.660
service to Western sacred history.

00:19.660 --> 00:23.480
They're custodians of that, they're custodians of that in so many ways.

00:23.480 --> 00:33.380
These texts were targeting the broader Mediterranean work and you know, that seems beyond dispute

00:33.380 --> 00:41.760
really, but the problem is that there's little work being done to try and contextualize it

00:41.760 --> 00:48.600
within that world and it's a giant wave and to use the analogy, the Christians, they've

00:48.600 --> 00:52.140
got their surfboards out and they're riding the wave but they're not the only ones on

00:52.140 --> 01:01.540
the wave and it re-inscribes the myth of the evolution of Western sacred history that

01:01.540 --> 01:10.220
we evolved out of this like orgy of madness because Christianity came on the scene.

01:10.220 --> 01:13.740
I got to the point when I was writing it, I started to, in my mind, I was having all

01:13.740 --> 01:19.620
of these arguments with all of the supposed leading scholars of our time, there were New

01:19.660 --> 01:24.300
Testament folks and I got to the point where it was just maddening, I just thought, you

01:24.300 --> 01:26.380
know what, that's a waste.

01:26.380 --> 01:34.660
This is actually putting at risk the future, it's an existential threat by, you know, by

01:34.660 --> 01:42.540
possible relation, it produces certain existential threats to our own species in some ways.

01:42.540 --> 01:44.900
To not have clarity on these issues is embarrassing.

01:50.620 --> 01:58.900
Dr. Richard C. Miller is a transdisciplinary research scholar exploring the cultural and

01:58.900 --> 02:05.860
literal nexus between classical antiquity and the social origins of earliest Christianity.

02:05.860 --> 02:11.860
His published work focuses on the mythological roots of the New Testament gospel, the portraitures

02:11.860 --> 02:17.060
of Jesus, the sacralized founding figure of the Christian religion.

02:17.060 --> 02:23.260
Miller undertook his graduate work at Talbot School of Theology, Masters of Divinity, Princeton

02:23.260 --> 02:29.660
Theological Seminary, Yale University, and Claremont Graduate University where he got

02:29.660 --> 02:31.140
his PhD.

02:31.140 --> 02:35.140
This discussion is going to be very controversial.

02:35.140 --> 02:41.260
Your favorite Bible scholar might get dissed whether he's a liberal or conservative, we

02:41.260 --> 02:42.620
don't care.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.060
Are they correct?

02:44.060 --> 02:45.940
Are they bringing the sources?

02:46.020 --> 02:47.980
Are they looking at the data?

02:47.980 --> 02:49.820
We're going to talk about that in this video.

02:49.820 --> 02:51.020
Stay tuned.

02:51.020 --> 02:55.980
And welcome back to the Gnostic Conformant and you are about to attain true gnosis.

02:55.980 --> 03:01.700
Today I'm with Richard C. Miller and you just saw in the intro there, he's got some books

03:01.700 --> 03:06.140
available in the description, we're going to talk about that stuff.

03:06.140 --> 03:09.700
For example, like the one that we're discussing the most, Resurrection and Reception and Early

03:09.700 --> 03:12.940
Christianity, great book.

03:13.020 --> 03:17.980
I just want to get right into the main thing that I want to discuss and we're going to

03:17.980 --> 03:22.540
branch out in different directions when we start talking about this is what is the cultural

03:22.540 --> 03:27.820
milieu that Christianity sort of comes out of.

03:27.820 --> 03:33.540
And it almost seems like you're having, there's one story that you get from tradition.

03:33.540 --> 03:37.540
And then there's another story when you look at the evidence and it seemed to not really,

03:37.540 --> 03:41.500
there's some overlap obviously, but there's something different going on there.

03:41.700 --> 03:43.940
And that's what I want to get into this about.

03:43.940 --> 03:51.100
Is Christianity just a pure offshoot of Judaism in its sense that it claims to be, or is there

03:51.100 --> 03:56.540
other cultural aspects in the broader Mediterranean world that are playing parts in this?

03:58.620 --> 04:04.460
Yeah, I think probably as I've thought about this question for quite a while, as you can

04:04.460 --> 04:09.460
imagine having, you know, gone through my book there and I am staking out a position

04:09.460 --> 04:12.500
with regard to that, that I feel very strongly about.

04:12.500 --> 04:17.500
So it's not an accident that you're asking me this question, Neil.

04:17.500 --> 04:24.140
I would first like to point out that I think there's a tendency going into this.

04:24.140 --> 04:25.940
I think it's a bias that comes into it.

04:25.940 --> 04:31.380
And it's mostly because where do people enter this discussion, usually from a faith background

04:31.380 --> 04:38.420
presented within certain contexts that are interested in training people within their

04:38.460 --> 04:41.260
religious kind of worldview, right?

04:41.260 --> 04:47.820
And so from an academic standpoint, though, I think we need to make a distinction between

04:47.820 --> 04:53.060
the setting in the narrative, like say in the Gospels, what's the setting?

04:53.060 --> 05:01.660
Well, it's Palestine, it's Judea, it's Jerusalem, it's Galilee, it's Samaria, it's these places, right?

05:01.660 --> 05:07.900
And the literary context, well, that's the area where you get all of the cultural fabric,

05:08.700 --> 05:11.660
the linguistic content that's going into this.

05:11.660 --> 05:15.580
Who are the readers and what's their world that they're living in?

05:15.580 --> 05:17.220
What are they swimming in?

05:17.220 --> 05:19.300
Linguistically, culturally.

05:19.300 --> 05:28.820
And those are two very different questions, but they get conflated heavily in New Testament scholarship.

05:28.820 --> 05:34.580
And I think there are a number of reasons for that and we can get into that in this interview.

05:34.580 --> 05:38.500
I know we want to hit on that further in the discussion here.

05:39.900 --> 05:46.140
But just enough to say that these texts were targeting the broader Mediterranean work.

05:47.060 --> 05:52.580
And that seems beyond dispute, really.

05:53.100 --> 06:01.540
But the problem is that there's little work being done to try and contextualize it within that world.

06:01.540 --> 06:11.780
And so there's a sense of trying to sequester it off into Judaism and to see Judaism as if early Christianity were a sect of Judaism

06:11.780 --> 06:22.100
and as if Judaism itself were somehow siloed off culturally from the rest of the broader Mediterranean world at that time.

06:22.100 --> 06:28.700
That's such a good point that I want to highlight that because I think this is where the problem starts.

06:28.700 --> 06:41.380
Judaism as a religion, it develops just like every other religion does, just like every other cultural entity or association or classia, whatever you want.

06:41.380 --> 06:51.060
All these are different associations, Orphism, Pythagoreanism, Platonism, Paganism, whatever that means, like the local mystery cults and all that stuff.

06:51.060 --> 06:56.660
And over in Jerusalem, you have another development and we call it Judaism today.

06:56.660 --> 07:05.340
But this comes out of the same Mediterranean or, I should say, in the broader Middle Eastern world going towards the Babylonians.

07:05.340 --> 07:11.420
And they're drawing from all the same cultural milios and it's the same process happening just in this part of the world.

07:11.420 --> 07:23.660
So I think the biggest mistake we make is we draw a border around Israel and say that's monotheism, that's Judaism, and everyone else is Pagan.

07:23.660 --> 07:30.340
And there's a dichotomy and it's like, it's so wrong to say that, by the way, no one called themselves Pagans, no one.

07:30.340 --> 07:38.860
That's like a derogatory term that happens later, it means like hellbilly, it means like you're a hellbilly, you're not educated, you don't have the Christian faith, you're an idiot, you're a Pagan.

07:38.860 --> 07:47.500
That's not, Paganism doesn't exist, it's just, you have these different cults in different cities, different priesthoods, and they're all drawing from the same cultural stuff.

07:47.500 --> 07:57.380
They all do the same bull sacrifices, they all do the same lamb sacrifices, they all do the same type of oracle systems and they'll have like, temples built the same way.

07:57.380 --> 08:00.980
It's all this, it's like there really is no division happening.

08:00.980 --> 08:04.740
So I wanted to highlight that and I'll let you continue on what you're saying.

08:04.740 --> 08:22.820
Oh yeah, so under the draft within the crucible of say, the Maccabean period, that's when you get the different sects of Judaism rising and it starts to fragment or fracture out into all of these different kind of manifestations or brands or types or permutations.

08:22.820 --> 08:34.700
And let me say something about that too, and people get mad when I cut off people, but this is such a big thing right here, because yes, in the Maccabean period, you're seeing them, you're seeing them push themselves,

08:34.700 --> 08:50.700
push themselves away from the broader Hellenization world, even though they're all named, even though they all have Hellenized names like Jason Maccabean, let's put that aside for now, let's put that aside for now, let's say, okay, they reject all these other cults.

08:50.860 --> 09:07.700
Well, so have you read Plato's Republic, where he says all these different Homeric and Hesiod themes are teaching children to be bad people and we need a better, more up to date type of religion.

09:07.700 --> 09:20.060
And then even beyond Platonism, even beyond the philosophical sects, in Rome in 186 BCE, they were horrified at the Bacchic priesthoods that were surrounding Rome.

09:20.140 --> 09:22.260
And they outlawed the Bacchic cult.

09:22.780 --> 09:33.420
And by the way, Maccabees, the God that they're going up against is Dionysus, specifically, I think Zeus too, but they were talking about the Dionysian procession coming in from Antiochus.

09:33.980 --> 09:41.700
So to me, that's no different than the Romans outlawing Bacchus, and what's the difference there?

09:41.740 --> 09:42.660
There's no difference to me.

09:42.940 --> 09:46.780
So I think it becomes what happens is they're all drawn from the same cultural stuff.

09:47.060 --> 09:54.260
But then once you become your own priesthood, your own entity, that's when you take on an individual role and say it's us versus them type of thing.

09:54.820 --> 10:06.260
But that's not to say that they're like a different planet or they need to have a force field around them and that they can't draw from these other cultural ideas.

10:06.300 --> 10:08.340
That's, you know, and I just wanted to point that out.

10:08.340 --> 10:09.340
What are your thoughts on that?

10:10.260 --> 10:15.260
Well, yeah, so you have the Alexander's Conquest to the East, right?

10:15.740 --> 10:22.900
And you have the different kingdoms that split off from that, that you've got, you know, the Seleucids and Ptolemies, et cetera.

10:23.540 --> 10:35.180
And the Seleucid Empire is basically that's occupying the region that we would consider to be the stomping ground of the New Testament later under Roman governance.

10:35.180 --> 10:47.540
But prior to that, it was, and that's where you get Antiochus Epiphanes and the story in two Maccabees about the martyrs and their resistance to the tyrant.

10:47.580 --> 10:50.260
It's, it's causing the tyrant multiple times.

10:50.780 --> 10:53.060
It's a political resistance largely.

10:54.140 --> 11:00.620
When you get to the Pharisees, you, I mean, they're described even in the New Testament as having embraced a lot of Persian ideas.

11:00.620 --> 11:16.140
You've got demons and apocalypse and resurrection and angels and all sorts of things that are that would be occultic in some ways to a pure kind of idea that you're rising out of classical Hebrew tradition.

11:16.180 --> 11:20.860
And so they're more open-minded, a lot more, actually.

11:20.860 --> 11:27.420
In fact, that's kind of the banner under which they're, they're marching in some ways is that that's their, their posture to all that.

11:28.420 --> 11:32.980
There's the temple that continues to be contested through that period.

11:32.980 --> 11:40.420
And so the Maccabean literature, we have it in Greek, right, which is, that should say enough right there, what's going on.

11:40.420 --> 11:51.540
But there's, there's a tendency to want to convert the temple to Jerusalem, Jerusalem to a temple that's conflates the two deities, Zeus and Yahweh.

11:52.140 --> 12:10.580
They're both mountain deities, the sky deities that are kind of principle and in those different cultures and to try and see the, and if you read against the grain in the Maccabean literature, there was a massive resistance within Judaism against those that were resisting Hellenization.

12:10.580 --> 12:17.100
And so there was pro and, and, you know, there, there, there were, there were those that were in favor and those that were against that.

12:17.420 --> 12:33.380
And some of them wanted to have their city revamped and, and with portugos and colonnades and, and all of the, you know, gymnasia and all of the nice cities of a modern Greek city, you know, they wanted that for their own people.

12:33.660 --> 12:46.900
And, and understandably, and they were open minded to the idea of syncretizing with classical Greek or, you know, Hellenistic, even religious forms, even, even seeing Zeus and Yahweh.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.660
As synonymous to that extent.

12:49.900 --> 12:53.940
And in fact, in Samaria, it succeeds that temple.

12:53.940 --> 13:08.100
If you go back and actually read the Maccabean literature, that the temple where Jesus was also Messiah, you know, when he went to the woman of the well and all that, you know, he was their Messiah to their temple was dedicated to Zeus Yahweh.

13:08.580 --> 13:17.340
Yeah. And Demetrius, Demetrius Philarium, when he wrote that letter to the, I forgot who it was, the high priest, I think it was the high priest.

13:18.340 --> 13:29.540
He says, yeah, you, we call him Zeus, you call him, you call him, whatever, I think he says Yahweh, I can't remember, but it's, it's the, it's the letter that's that Josephus relates.

13:30.180 --> 13:44.140
And it's right before they do the Septuagint translation, he's saying, yeah, you know, your laws are very, very noble and very divine and we were all the same, we're all on the same boat, we, yeah, Zeus, we call him life, Xena, we call him the same as you guys.

13:44.620 --> 13:47.260
And so you can see that sort of thing happening.

13:47.980 --> 14:13.020
And another thing, and you mentioned the gymnasium as an abomination mentioned in Maccabees, but Plato's laws specifically call out gymnasiums as being places where evil happens and children are, you know, homosexuality comes, like, all this, he sort of like says, we need to get rid of these gymnasiums, or we should have them, but they should be really regulated, there's some sort of thing like that.

14:13.620 --> 14:37.060
And it's like, there's an prime example, like you can see, this is something that's developing across the board, where people are, it's like the sort of movement of piety, I call it, like where people are sort of growing out of the, the orgy, you know, the orgy, orgy of religions of, of the ancient world, because those are pretty prominent.

14:37.660 --> 14:55.540
So some of these, uh, Bacchic sex, but it's not just Judaism that's doing this, it's all, all across the board, you're seeing the Orphics, you're seeing the Platonists, the Pythagoreans, and they're all sort of adopting this, well, we should be humble and pious, and we should reject the bodily, bodily pleasures.

14:55.740 --> 15:01.420
And this is sort of a movement that's not, it's happening just across the board in general, and I don't see it just happening in one space.

15:02.220 --> 15:22.780
Yes, the early Christians did not define that, that's the ascetical eschasis, you might want to, you know, that's one way to describe it, and then it comes out of the philosophical tradition, it's a giant wave, and to use the analogy, the Christians, they've got their surfboards out and they're riding the wave, but they're not the only ones on the wave.

15:23.780 --> 15:33.780
They're not defining the wave, they are in some ways taking it to certain extremes through certain manifestations, like Marverdon and these kind of things, but they're not even unique in that.

15:34.300 --> 15:51.100
And so, um, ascetical kind of a disposition that had become very popular, in fact, Veronica Grimm, under whom I studied on the East Coast there, she wrote a book from feasting to fasting, and it basically traces that trajectory from the Homeric period,

15:51.620 --> 16:17.020
all the way into late antiquity, where attitudes regarding, you know, self-discipline and, you know, constraints, self-restraint, austerity, fasting, and the emancipation of that, but it's shown in all sorts of ways, and largely is falling from the classical philosophical traditions.

16:17.020 --> 16:38.180
And so, there's a kind of a polarity there that's going on between, they're criticizing, the philosophers are criticizing a lot of the classical mythological forms, and you know, the indulgence of Zeus is just, you know, they're becoming critics in some ways of that,

16:38.180 --> 16:55.940
you know, of course, trying to thread that line carefully, not to get themselves into too much trouble, but that's where they're coming from in that, and Christianity arises within that, and is itself a product of that larger conversation and contestation that's going on in antiquity.

16:56.780 --> 17:05.180
This is my, okay, this is what I want to get into, because this is my, someone who's not an expert, I'm just a big nerd, and I love reading about this stuff.

17:06.180 --> 17:23.180
As, in the same way a nerd of Star Wars would get mad about the new Star Wars movie not being politically correct compared to like the, the canon or whatever, you know, I can sort of relate to that as like someone who's a really nerdy about ancient history and mythology and religions,

17:23.180 --> 17:37.180
whereas I'm thinking, why aren't some of these focuses being, some of these areas of study being focused on more by New Testament scholarship, it's only, I'm only seeing it in classicists, and specific like Egyptologists or, you know,

17:37.180 --> 17:57.180
you know, Thraciologists that study the origin of Thrace, and like, and I've brought up Thraciologists because there's a scholar, Rujapapava, and PhD at the Institute of Balkan Studies and Center of Thracology, and this person writing all these articles about this religion coming

17:57.180 --> 18:19.180
from the Hellenistic region, from the 4th century BC, all through the 1st century, even beyond that, these Ipsisterian people who are worshiping God Most High, and they don't, they don't care about circumcision of the Mosaic laws, but they mingle with Jews, like there's evidence that they're, that they're friends with, they're friendly with the Jews, they like them, they like their scriptures a little bit,

18:19.180 --> 18:45.180
but they're not like, then we don't care about circumcision, we don't have images of God, we just worship God, and he's just like this, he's just like this idea, and it's almost like the Platonist God coming, coming forth in this religion, and then you have them, then they find out in these inscriptions, they call themselves Seboi Manoi, or Theosabes, God-fearers, this is what they call themselves, the titles they, these are the people that Paul are writing to in his letters,

18:45.180 --> 19:11.180
and not even that, Seboi Manoi is who he addresses in this, in the narrative of Acts, so whoever wrote that, whoever wrote that is making Paul address them in that narrative, so I'm thinking, now I'm not, that doesn't necessarily mean they are Ipsisterians, but I'm, what I'm, what I'm gathering is that at the very least, there's an overlap between the cultural religious attitudes of Thrace and Phrygia, modern-day Turkey,

19:12.180 --> 19:38.180
by the way, where Christianity explodes, where the Church of Constantinople is, this is where they move the capital, this is where the Church Fathers of Bithynia, that little area of Bithynia, that's the first time Christianity's mentioned by Plain of the Younger, so we're talking about Christianity seems like more of a development of northern Turkey, southern Thrace, than it is for Israel,

19:38.180 --> 19:57.180
yes, and this is my concern, I want to hear your thoughts on this, why is it that people are, maybe they are, maybe I'm just not seeing it, but why is it that it seems like we're not looking at the developments of this region, and how they come out of this region, rather than trying to see it as like this Jewish offshoot?

19:58.180 --> 20:12.180
Yeah, that's all great question, well, first off, I think with all the people you've been talking to on your show, great show by the way, Neil, you've had some of the world, the top world experts on here, I'm honored to be a guest,

20:12.180 --> 20:41.180
you know, we all probably need to get together and give you, award you with like an honorary doctorate or something like that, you know, or more than many of the people that claim to know so much in our field, and so just a little, yeah, no, it's great to have a conversation, you could run with the best in these conversations, and so it's more than just a Star Wars fan at this point, I think for you, yeah,

20:42.180 --> 21:01.180
so I think you're absolutely correct, why aren't we studying the hell out of Bethany, why aren't we studying the hell out of Macedonia and Rome, and the cultural hubs where this religion caught fire and just ignited, why aren't those largely rejected in Jerusalem?

21:02.180 --> 21:24.180
Judah is largely unaffected by the rise of Christianity, you could make a case to the contrary, but it'd be pretty puny and scanty that the Judaism was largely, you know, had the rise of Christianity had this massive impact on Judaism, it absolutely was, it was a full scale cultural revolution, though, in the Greco-Roman world.

21:25.180 --> 21:42.180
That's where these texts are getting traction, that's where they're being marketed, that's where they're being written, that's where they're being consumed, that's where the religion is taking off, that's where these texts are targeting those contexts and are the earliest evidence.

21:42.180 --> 22:09.180
When you look at Paul, where's he at? Is he hanging out writing stuff in Hebrew in Jerusalem? No, he's almost indistinguishable from like an itinerant philosopher in his own right, almost like a, I don't know, an occultic middle Platonist kind of running around with his own cultic conceptions, largely untethered to Judaism.

22:10.180 --> 22:22.180
He doesn't not see himself and the earliest Christians are abrogating, they're abrogating, they're giving up nearly every separatist practice that Judaism had claimed at that time.

22:23.180 --> 22:38.180
They're giving up circumcision, they're giving up, you know, eating separately, they're giving up, you go down the list and part of the gist or even importance of this literature is that letting go of each one of those pieces, right?

22:39.180 --> 22:56.180
And so, and that the mission has shifted to the Gentile, you know, so to speak, the nations, the ethnic, and so that's the narrative that's going on early on and then in the earliest evidence of the Christian tradition or traditions.

22:56.180 --> 23:11.180
And so that should be what we're studying. And it's written, these are texts that are written in Greek that are playing on and riffing on and trying to create their own adaptations of the larger within the larger Hellenistic world.

23:12.180 --> 23:18.180
And this isn't unique to Christianity. If you go down to Egypt, they're doing the same thing like Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt.

23:19.180 --> 23:24.180
They've got their own Hellenistic forms that are built on top of their more ancient forms there.

23:25.180 --> 23:42.180
If you go to Palmyra or Edessa or any of these other places where Christianity also took off, these are also syncretic areas where you'll find all sorts of amalgams between those different cultural, the cultural hardware that was available at the time.

23:42.180 --> 23:58.180
And Christianity, as it took off in other directions, like say Nestorianism or Manichaeanism, highly syncretic. These are traditions of Christianity that ventured out into the East and flourished there and whatnot.

23:59.180 --> 24:21.180
And those are highly syncretic that are hybrid with traditions in those directions, like for instance Buddhism. If you go to Manichaeanism, it's got Buddhist ideas in it, it's got Indic ideas in it, it's got Persian ideas into it in it and Parthian and so forth.

24:21.180 --> 24:31.180
And so you've got the tradition that's going toward Rome, that's the one that we have mostly preserved, at least in evidence in our New Testament.

24:32.180 --> 24:40.180
And lo and behold, it is syncretic toward the classical Greco-Roman forms and the Roman Hellenistic period.

24:40.180 --> 24:49.180
And so that's the bedrock underneath this and those are the hardware on which this software is being ran, so to speak.

24:50.180 --> 25:03.180
If you want to look at that as an analogy, the New Testament, the earliest Christian cult that's preserved in that trajectory toward Rome, that software that's running on the classical Mediterranean hardware at the time.

25:04.180 --> 25:09.180
People that were in Corinth, were they deeply steeped in Judaism? No.

25:10.180 --> 25:20.180
Even when you, I brought this up in a separate interview, but when you look at the first major successful gospel, we want to call it that, Mark.

25:21.180 --> 25:28.180
If you dig in there, the Jews are mentioned in the third person and they're criticized throughout the text in so many ways, right?

25:28.180 --> 25:39.180
And this is not a flattering for a picture of Judaism at the time, for the most part. It's a fairly scathing critique across it in many ways.

25:40.180 --> 25:45.180
Even Matthew gets sort of labeled as the most Jewish of all.

25:46.180 --> 25:49.180
Even Matthew was kind of picking on the Jews a little bit.

25:50.180 --> 25:54.180
And you also have Magi following a star, right?

25:54.180 --> 26:02.180
That's not Jewish. So even the most Jewish gospel of all has some problems with it.

26:03.180 --> 26:05.180
And then you look at like, what are the Jews saying about Christianity?

26:06.180 --> 26:08.180
They're going to read some of these mission attacks.

26:09.180 --> 26:12.180
They're not very friendly towards the Christians either.

26:13.180 --> 26:16.180
So the evidence you show is they're friction there.

26:17.180 --> 26:19.180
They're not overlapping and they're not friendly with each other.

26:20.180 --> 26:23.180
They don't even consider the Christians as fellow Jews, I don't think.

26:24.180 --> 26:33.180
Right. Now, obviously we would see Paul as coming out of Judaism and other really cult leaders and founders and stuff in some way.

26:34.180 --> 26:43.180
But also early on, you see a lot of others that are jumping in and some of the writers, even in the New Testament, who's Luke?

26:44.180 --> 26:48.180
Is that a devout Jew from Jerusalem?

26:48.180 --> 26:51.180
Well, I don't think so. And I don't think Mark was either.

26:52.180 --> 26:54.180
It was a traveling companion that jumped in later.

26:55.180 --> 27:05.180
Again, he describes them in the third person and then has to explain Judaism in these glosses throughout the text.

27:06.180 --> 27:13.180
He stops at one point and he says, oh, and by the way, the Jews, when they eat, they need to wash their pots and pans

27:13.180 --> 27:22.180
and make sure and follow their purity practice because that's what they, you know, and he's giving this, you don't have to describe that to Jewish people.

27:23.180 --> 27:25.180
And that borders on an insult to them.

27:26.180 --> 27:30.180
If this is a text primarily targeting Jewish people, that's absurd.

27:31.180 --> 27:38.180
Like I said on Derek's channel, that would be like trying to describe a football to professional football players.

27:38.180 --> 27:40.180
Like it's a ridiculous thing.

27:41.180 --> 27:57.180
It seems like, but I think we do have to mention that they are obviously drawing from Old Testament narratives and they're sort of making Jesus fulfill a lot of the stuff happening throughout, not just the Torah, but like even the prophets and stuff in Isaiah.

27:58.180 --> 28:05.180
And they're taking all these themes from Isaiah and from Zechariah and from Moses and the story of Moses and Abraham.

28:05.180 --> 28:06.180
And they're sort of putting it on the Jesus.

28:07.180 --> 28:09.180
But that comes through the Septuagint, if I'm not mistaken.

28:10.180 --> 28:13.180
There's no evidence that they're really using anything from the Hebrew side.

28:14.180 --> 28:18.180
It's almost like it seems like they're pretty much just drawing from the Septuagint, which is a Greek text.

28:19.180 --> 28:20.180
Yeah, yeah.

28:21.180 --> 28:27.180
And I would go even further than that because they're spoon feeding that to their readers as if the readers weren't really steeped in it.

28:28.180 --> 28:38.180
And, you know, they have to like lead them into these texts, into these kind of interpretations that they're giving, which we can get into just how valid those interpretations are.

28:39.180 --> 28:43.180
Like the messianism that's in the New Testament, largely not embraced.

28:44.180 --> 28:49.180
A lot of those concepts are not embraced in Judaism, but that's the way that they want to draw it up.

28:50.180 --> 28:51.180
That's the form within the cult.

28:51.180 --> 29:01.180
And this is the way it's being fed to early converts out in the Far Flung Empire in places like Corinth and Ephesus, highly Hellenistic cities.

29:02.180 --> 29:04.180
Hellenism was rampant in these cities.

29:05.180 --> 29:17.180
And these were the, it's almost like in New Testament studies, it's supposed that the early converts were dropped in from some unimaginably alien place.

29:18.180 --> 29:26.180
And we're just finding all of this completely, you know, befuddling, you know, like, what are all these people doing?

29:27.180 --> 29:30.180
No, they had been swimming in this for generations.

29:31.180 --> 29:32.180
These were the people that lived in these cities.

29:33.180 --> 29:36.180
And Hellenism was, that was the way of it.

29:37.180 --> 29:42.180
And so it wasn't, it wasn't a decision, it wasn't Jewish or Hellenism.

29:42.180 --> 29:48.180
It was, Jews were variously also dedicated to Hellenism.

29:49.180 --> 29:51.180
So it wasn't God of me.

29:52.180 --> 30:01.180
Let me jump in on that for a second, because I think a good example that gives us a big picture of what some of these more Hellenized Jews were thinking is Philo.

30:02.180 --> 30:04.180
Philo of Alexandria.

30:05.180 --> 30:11.180
And he explicitly says, all right, so this is the, this works.

30:12.180 --> 30:17.180
Now, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to admit, I'm going to tweak one of the words he has here.

30:17.180 --> 30:19.180
I think I would translate it differently.

30:19.180 --> 30:20.180
And he uses the word logos.

30:20.180 --> 30:21.180
He transits it as reason.

30:22.180 --> 30:27.180
But I'm going to change the logos because I think it, I want people to hear it for what it sounds like in the Greek.

30:28.180 --> 30:29.180
It's called, it's Philo.

30:29.180 --> 30:30.180
It's called on creation.

30:30.180 --> 30:34.180
And people want to look this up on creation X 36.

30:35.180 --> 30:37.180
He says the incorporeal world.

30:37.180 --> 30:38.180
This is very Platonist.

30:38.180 --> 30:43.180
When you hear that incorporeal, incorporeal, this is all, Plato loves these types of language, by the way.

30:44.180 --> 30:49.180
So already, when you hear the word incorporeal, you're like, okay, Plato thinking of Platonism.

30:49.180 --> 31:01.180
Incorporeal world was already completed having its seat in the divine logos and the world perceptible by the external senses was made on the model of it.

31:02.180 --> 31:11.180
And the first portion of it being also the most excellent of all made by the creator was the heaven, which he truly called the firmament.

31:12.180 --> 31:25.180
As being corporal for the body is by nature firm in so much that it's divisible into three parts and whatever the other idea of solidity and the body can there be except that it is something which may be measured in every direction.

31:25.180 --> 31:38.180
Therefore, he very naturally contrasting that was perceptible to the external senses in the corporal with that which was perceptible by the intellect and the incorporeal calls this the firmament.

31:39.180 --> 31:46.180
Now, if you read that, if there wait, he says divine reason, which it's correct reason logos.

31:46.180 --> 31:48.180
I guess you can say that.

31:48.180 --> 31:50.180
But I would have kept the word logos.

31:50.180 --> 31:58.180
Because now all of a sudden, you're like, wait, the gods creating the world incorporeal and incorporeal through his logos.

31:58.180 --> 31:59.180
That's what it sounds like.

31:59.180 --> 32:04.180
It almost sounds like maybe John might be drawing from this or something similar.

32:04.180 --> 32:10.180
Maybe if it's not phylo, maybe this idea is floating around in the world and in the Hellenized Jewish world.

32:10.180 --> 32:13.180
And this is very plateness, by the way, incorporeal, incorporeal.

32:13.180 --> 32:20.180
By the way, there's another passage in here where he says the three parts are incorporeal, corporal and spiritual.

32:20.180 --> 32:26.180
And you're like, that has so much Trinitarian stuff floating around in that sentence.

32:26.180 --> 32:35.180
Because like corporal, which is the corporal, which is flesh, incorporeal, the father and then spiritual Holy Spirit.

32:35.180 --> 32:38.180
Like you're like, what is this where this Trinity comes from?

32:38.180 --> 32:40.180
I'm just like throwing ideas out there.

32:40.180 --> 32:41.180
I could be wrong.

32:41.180 --> 32:42.180
I don't know.

32:42.180 --> 32:50.180
But the reason why I wanted to bring this part up is because here's a prime example of a Jewish philosopher who's completely Jewish to the core.

32:50.180 --> 32:51.180
No doubt about it.

32:51.180 --> 32:52.180
He loves Moses.

32:52.180 --> 32:53.180
He loves the laws.

32:53.180 --> 32:54.180
He loves Abraham.

32:54.180 --> 32:55.180
Read phylo.

32:55.180 --> 32:56.180
It's Jewish.

32:56.180 --> 33:00.180
He's not a pagan or whatever, pagan or whatever you want to call it.

33:00.180 --> 33:02.180
But he's also very Platonist.

33:02.180 --> 33:03.180
He loves Plato.

33:03.180 --> 33:07.180
He says Plato is divinely inspired in this book.

33:07.180 --> 33:10.180
So this is a prime example.

33:10.180 --> 33:23.180
Somebody living in Alexandria, who's writing in Greek, who's relating Jewish ideas, but through the Hellenistic philosophy lens of middle Platonism and Stoicism.

33:23.180 --> 33:26.180
Well, that's exactly what you described it to a T.

33:26.180 --> 33:28.180
That's exactly what's going on there.

33:28.180 --> 33:38.180
He's creating a fashionable kind of rendition of revamping Judaism in some ways within the structures of the philosophical world at that time.

33:38.180 --> 33:49.180
Presenting himself as a sort of Jewish philosopher that's on the par with or at least could have respectability within that context.

33:49.180 --> 34:02.180
Alexandria was was a major center, you know, rival Athens in terms of its philosophical schools and sophistication and reputation and Judaism.

34:02.180 --> 34:14.180
In that context, there were different forms, obviously, but he represents in some ways the height of that in at least in terms of one writer that survives from that time, one thinker.

34:14.180 --> 34:33.180
And yeah, he is bringing forward his place drawing on the classical philosophical tradition and in many ways showing his religion to be sophisticated and and and able to be conveyed through that lens as you described it.

34:33.180 --> 34:38.180
The the Demiurgos, the Timaeus and Plato's Timaeus.

34:38.180 --> 34:47.180
Firstly, one thing that's missing is, you know, maybe we need to take all of Plato's works and just blew them onto the bottom of our, our new testum or something like that.

34:47.180 --> 34:49.180
Just so everyone knows.

34:49.180 --> 35:02.180
I've been saying that significant and important and and defining those works were to the psyche and the intellectual, the kind of the top thinkers of that time.

35:03.180 --> 35:10.180
I'm actually surprised that New Testament seminarians don't have to replay though or Greek at all.

35:10.180 --> 35:13.180
That you think this would be mandatory.

35:13.180 --> 35:22.180
I mean, it's like, it's like, imagine trying to understand economics and not doing math.

35:22.180 --> 35:23.180
Right.

35:23.180 --> 35:25.180
Exactly. Exactly.

35:25.180 --> 35:30.180
Exactly. You know, it's not not even just Plato, but all of them.

35:30.180 --> 35:37.180
I mean, if you go over to it, you should, they should also glue Homer to the bottom of everyone's duty.

35:37.180 --> 35:41.180
Every every convert to this religion knew the works of Homer.

35:41.180 --> 35:52.180
They might not have known it, you know, verbatim as a memorized text, but they were steeped in it and they were immersed in this, just like you spoke of Star Wars earlier.

35:53.180 --> 35:57.180
This, this was so much more important to them than our Star Wars.

35:57.180 --> 36:11.180
And, and so the idea that we're not studying the literary world of the ancient mind that the earliest converts that were coming into this, how were they thinking when they, when they came into this religion?

36:11.180 --> 36:19.180
It's almost like it's thought that, that somebody just erased the entire hard drive and, you know, put Christianity on there.

36:19.180 --> 36:21.180
And that's just not how human beings work.

36:21.180 --> 36:23.180
It's not how any culture works.

36:23.180 --> 36:26.180
Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's not realistic.

36:26.180 --> 36:30.180
And so Euripides would be another one that is just towering canonical.

36:30.180 --> 36:40.180
He see it. Another one towering canonical set of texts that come from his, his, his works there, works in days and theogony.

36:40.180 --> 36:46.180
Those should all be required reading for anyone that claims to be delving into.

36:47.180 --> 36:54.180
Especially theology as a, if you're, if you're, if you're a theology degree, PhD in theology, you should have to know this stuff.

36:54.180 --> 36:56.180
I think, just me, just personally.

36:56.180 --> 37:03.180
I think it's like very, I don't think I'm asking too much because theology is a Greek word that comes from the Platonist.

37:03.180 --> 37:05.180
The first theologian was Orpheus.

37:05.180 --> 37:07.180
He was called Orpheus the theologian.

37:07.180 --> 37:11.180
And he, by the way, he was also called an apocalypse, a revealer.

37:11.180 --> 37:17.180
So you have all this terminology that you get in Christianity coming from the Orphic Platonist world.

37:17.180 --> 37:21.180
And like you, how many people who had PhDs in theology don't even know that.

37:21.180 --> 37:23.180
Don't even know what your degree means.

37:30.180 --> 37:31.180
No, it is, it's absurd.

37:31.180 --> 37:33.180
You kind of wonder, what are they studying?

37:33.180 --> 37:37.180
You know, I brought this up, I brought this up many times, actually.

37:37.180 --> 37:46.180
That's part of the whole reason it's the, the, the, the discursive constraints is one, I've got a section in the book where I explore that.

37:46.180 --> 37:55.180
And that's part of the scandal of this whole field really is the, the arbitrary lines and walls that have been built up.

37:55.180 --> 38:03.180
They're relics, they're, they're leftovers from a Christian medieval scholastic kind of world that dominated.

38:03.180 --> 38:13.180
That's where we get our whole Western academic kind of structure is out of that world in some ways, the modern discourse in New Testament studies.

38:13.180 --> 38:27.180
I hate to say it, but it really is almost the last holdout of the dark ages in some ways in terms of trying to investigate these things with the kind of rigor that we would place on any other subject matter.

38:28.180 --> 38:33.180
Secular academics have not been governing this discourse.

38:33.180 --> 38:35.180
We're not defining it.

38:35.180 --> 38:45.180
We are not in control of kind of the, the primary description of, of, of what early Christianity was and how it got off the ground.

38:45.180 --> 38:53.180
We are, we are at best marginal voices that are drawn into question often for, it's almost suspicious.

38:53.180 --> 38:57.180
We're seeing it as we must be up to something, you know, we must.

38:57.180 --> 39:06.180
I've heard classes when I bring up New Testament studies and they just go, whatever, like, all right, let's talk about it.

39:07.180 --> 39:16.180
It's like, it's like something, I don't know, I'm not going to be rude, but anyways, there's some brilliant New Testament scholars out there.

39:16.180 --> 39:19.180
So I don't want to make it sound like I'm like, stop, like I'm better than anybody.

39:19.180 --> 39:20.180
I'm not, I'm just some random guy.

39:20.180 --> 39:22.180
I'm just pointing out what I'm noticing.

39:22.180 --> 39:23.180
Okay.

39:23.180 --> 39:25.180
But this is some of the stuff that frustrates me.

39:25.180 --> 39:30.180
And you mentioned there's these dogmas that are very present in biblical stuff, scholarship.

39:30.180 --> 39:40.180
And one of those is like this like allergic knee jerk reaction to anybody trying to draw from the outside to them.

39:40.180 --> 39:43.180
It's outside the broader Mediterranean world.

39:43.180 --> 39:52.180
And then like, for example, Dennis McDonald, I can't tell you how many times I've heard people say Dennis McDonald is Parallelomania.

39:52.180 --> 39:57.180
And I'll say, Oh, so which, which, which of his books did you read?

39:57.180 --> 39:58.180
Well, I didn't read it.

39:58.180 --> 39:59.180
I just heard that.

39:59.180 --> 40:03.180
I can't tell you how many times I've heard people say this, I'm not going to drop names here.

40:03.180 --> 40:07.180
But I'm, but people, some of these people listening right now are going to know that I'm talking about them.

40:07.180 --> 40:11.180
Because I've had these conversations with them and said, Dennis McDonald's Parallelomania.

40:11.180 --> 40:12.180
Oh, really?

40:12.180 --> 40:20.180
So you know, Greek, you read Homer, you've read Hesiod, you've read Aripides, you've read, you've read Aeschylus, and you've read Dennis's books.

40:20.180 --> 40:24.180
And now you, what's your, let me hear why Dennis, well, I haven't even read any of that stuff.

40:24.180 --> 40:26.180
I just, this is just what I've heard.

40:26.180 --> 40:27.180
Yeah.

40:27.180 --> 40:28.180
But why would you even say that?

40:28.180 --> 40:30.180
Just say you don't even, you don't know if Dennis is correct.

40:30.180 --> 40:31.180
I have to look into it.

40:31.180 --> 40:32.180
Wouldn't that be the correct thing to do?

40:32.180 --> 40:35.180
Wouldn't that be the rigorous, honest thing to say?

40:35.180 --> 40:40.180
Hey, I heard Dennis, Dennis, Dennis's book goes a little far, but me personally, I don't know Homer.

40:40.180 --> 40:43.180
I don't know, uh, uh, uh, Euripides, Bacchae.

40:43.180 --> 40:44.180
I don't even know Greek.

40:44.180 --> 40:46.180
So I'm not going to weigh in on that.

40:46.180 --> 40:47.180
I'm just going to, I'm just telling you what I heard.

40:47.180 --> 40:49.180
I'm like, okay, I respect that answer.

40:49.180 --> 40:53.180
But the first thing he said was it's Parallelomania.

40:53.180 --> 40:55.180
Christianity is a niche religion, man.

40:55.180 --> 40:56.180
That's what they said.

40:56.180 --> 40:57.180
That's what he said.

40:57.180 --> 41:02.180
And I've heard, it's not just, this is, I've heard this from like five different New Testament scholars that I've talked to.

41:02.180 --> 41:12.180
They're saying Dennis is, eh, now I'm not saying Dennis is like omniscient and everyone needs to like bow to his work and like know his stuff.

41:12.180 --> 41:15.180
But I am saying like at least know the material that is coming from.

41:15.180 --> 41:24.180
And he points out, some of the stuff that he points out that's indisputable in my opinion is the practice of you training people to learn Greek by copying Homer in Euripides.

41:24.180 --> 41:37.180
So he points out, look, the people who wrote the Gospels most likely better, better chance than not have were trained in learning the classics like Homer in Euripides.

41:37.180 --> 41:39.180
That's right.

41:39.180 --> 41:40.180
That's right.

41:40.180 --> 41:43.180
It's, it's for lack of training in that field.

41:43.180 --> 41:50.180
It's mostly people having, well, they, so how do people even get jobs in this field?

41:50.180 --> 41:57.180
You could look back up the whole thing and think, okay, is it, is it because they're skilled at deconstructing the Christian religion?

41:57.180 --> 42:01.180
Is that, is that how you become successful in this field?

42:01.180 --> 42:12.180
And no, it's, it's in service to largely the academic world that we call New Testament studies is in service to Western sacred history.

42:12.180 --> 42:14.180
They're custodians of that.

42:14.180 --> 42:16.180
They're custodians of that in so many ways.

42:16.180 --> 42:24.180
And so, and I, and I say them because I don't want to even, I, I, I pride myself on my electoral honesty.

42:24.180 --> 42:33.180
And you really do have to go back and study all that to even draw a conclusion that's worth listening to.

42:33.180 --> 42:41.180
You'd have to go back and actually take a deep immersive study of the canonicity of Homer in antiquity.

42:41.180 --> 42:47.180
Would you just how important mimesis was in the writing policies of the time?

42:47.180 --> 42:53.180
This was standard for people to, to imitate Homer in their narratives was standard.

42:53.180 --> 43:02.180
This wasn't just, this isn't just make Dennis McDonald off on the side, having some kind of whack theory.

43:02.180 --> 43:11.180
This is as the result of an entire field, neglecting the literary world of antiquity.

43:11.180 --> 43:12.180
Yeah.

43:12.180 --> 43:21.180
And John, the way John is written, the way John is written is like, I don't know how you can't come away with it as a tragedy.

43:21.180 --> 43:22.180
Right.

43:22.180 --> 43:29.180
The way it's written, the way the characters are presented, the secrets of events, all the stuff that lines up with other tragedies.

43:29.180 --> 43:34.180
And so does John, it should fit, it's like, just like any other tragedy does.

43:34.180 --> 43:37.180
You could almost take, I mean, here's one way to look at it.

43:37.180 --> 43:41.180
You could almost take, if you were to say, let's, let's, let's take a project here.

43:41.180 --> 43:52.180
You were to take, say the Elijah, Elisha cycle in classical Hebrew tradition, those stories of, you know, the healings and going about in the axe head and all that stuff.

43:52.180 --> 43:58.180
Here to take that, just the kind of episodic vignettes that are in that.

43:58.180 --> 44:03.180
And say, put in a bowl and mix that with Homer.

44:03.180 --> 44:07.180
Just mix all that together into one kind of combo.

44:07.180 --> 44:12.180
You would get something that is in pretty close proximity to the Gospels.

44:12.180 --> 44:13.180
Right.

44:13.180 --> 44:23.180
If you got to that point now, I'm not saying that explains the entire thing, but just that ought to be telling all in its own right, you know, that you've got, and you're right.

44:23.180 --> 44:31.180
No one is that very, very few in our field that sat down with Dennis's work and actually read what he's, he's written there.

44:31.180 --> 44:32.180
It's compelling there.

44:32.180 --> 44:33.180
You can't.

44:33.180 --> 44:35.180
I think he's too careful.

44:35.180 --> 44:38.180
I like me personally, I would go farther than he goes.

44:38.180 --> 44:47.180
He's very careful on things that he presents as what you would say speculation or his, his hypotheses.

44:47.180 --> 44:50.180
He's not just throwing out stuff at the wall with sticks.

44:50.180 --> 44:57.180
We and him have talked on the phone and I would say, but what about this passage that like sounds like this or whatever?

44:57.180 --> 44:59.180
And he'll go, I think you're being too speculative.

44:59.180 --> 45:04.180
He's, he's way careful or more careful than people give him credit for.

45:04.180 --> 45:05.180
He really is.

45:05.180 --> 45:06.180
It's true.

45:06.180 --> 45:07.180
It's true.

45:07.180 --> 45:13.180
Now I did my PhD under him and he's a fantastic mentor and he guided me in a wonderful way.

45:13.180 --> 45:15.180
And he's still somebody that guides me.

45:15.180 --> 45:17.180
I still have breakfast with him frequently.

45:17.180 --> 45:22.180
We live in the same community here and in the greater LA area and Claremont near the colleges here.

45:22.180 --> 45:25.180
And I have a lot of wonderful conversations with him.

45:25.180 --> 45:38.180
He is one of those people that has made a profound and really fundamental radical contribution to this field that goes still undiscovered.

45:38.180 --> 45:41.180
And it's mostly because of these dynamics.

45:41.180 --> 45:42.180
Paganism.

45:42.180 --> 45:43.180
What is Paganism?

45:43.180 --> 45:45.180
Why are we even using that term at this point?

45:45.180 --> 45:48.180
It's an acronym for earliest Christianity.

45:48.180 --> 45:54.180
No one was talking about the earliest Christians as Pagans at that time or outside of the early Christians being Pagans at that time.

45:54.180 --> 46:02.180
It's, it should never be used in an academic setting and any more than the Hick or any other derogatory word, the N word.

46:02.180 --> 46:11.180
You know, I don't mean to bring that into this, but it's a nasty word that's meant to create a version.

46:11.180 --> 46:28.180
And it, and it re, it re-inscribes the myth of the evolution of Western sacred history that we evolved out of this like orgy of madness because Christianity came on the scene.

46:28.180 --> 46:29.180
Right.

46:29.180 --> 46:31.180
Which is so false.

46:31.180 --> 46:33.180
Right.

46:34.180 --> 46:36.180
You're so right though.

46:36.180 --> 46:53.180
That's the impression you get from a lot of people in the New Testament studies realm is that there's the Greek Pagan world and they're all doing worshipping idols and, you know, sacrificing goats and just, just ignore what happens in the Old Testament.

46:53.180 --> 46:54.180
Forget about that stuff.

46:54.180 --> 46:57.180
It's just, it's only them doing, right?

46:57.180 --> 46:59.180
And then, but then they go even farther.

46:59.180 --> 47:15.180
And it's like, there, there's a separate border across the Pagans and these pious Christians that were, there were, these poor people were, were persecuted by these, these Romans that were, you know, worshipping Caesar.

47:15.180 --> 47:19.180
And it's like, it's way more, it's simplifying.

47:19.180 --> 47:22.180
It's so much that it sounds like a fairy tale.

47:22.180 --> 47:23.180
Right.

47:23.180 --> 47:28.180
And when you use that word Pagan, you're already, what you're doing is you just jumped into a dogma.

47:28.180 --> 47:38.180
And now it's, as soon as you use that word to describe the other, you, what you've done is you've limited yourself to understand the broader Mediterranean world.

47:38.180 --> 47:44.180
And you, now you're operating within a dogma that was created by the church in later times.

47:44.180 --> 47:50.180
So you're, you're all, without even realizing it, you're now operating within the dogmas of the church.

47:50.180 --> 47:52.180
Even if you don't even want to, you are.

47:53.180 --> 47:54.180
Right, right.

47:54.180 --> 47:57.180
And that's, I mean, this, this happens elsewhere as well.

47:57.180 --> 48:12.180
I mean, you can go into, you know, who were the barbarians, you know, like the, the, the, the, the victor rarely gets to paint the, I mean, the, the, the, the, the vanquished rarely get to paint the picture of their own history.

48:12.180 --> 48:14.180
Right. It's, it's written by others.

48:14.180 --> 48:20.180
And strangely enough, you can go back the evidence, the literary evidence for the Roman world is giant.

48:20.180 --> 48:22.180
You go back and read some of these people.

48:22.180 --> 48:23.180
Brilliant.

48:23.180 --> 48:25.180
Go read Cicero.

48:25.180 --> 48:29.180
You know, go read a virtual, go read any of these individuals.

48:29.180 --> 48:33.180
Not one of them should be given the indignity of being referred to as a pagan.

48:33.180 --> 48:43.180
Especially when you read Cicero's On the Nature of the Gods, the dialogue he has, he has a stoic dialogue with a priest and a somewhat Platonist or something.

48:43.180 --> 48:49.180
And they're, they're going, it's like a very, you could, this book is so important to me because it highlights in the first century,

48:49.180 --> 48:55.180
BC, it highlights that this conversation was being had about superstition.

48:55.180 --> 49:04.180
And Christianity is, gets credited for being the sort of step up from being superstitious, even though it's very superstitious too.

49:04.180 --> 49:07.180
Hope still comes out in January.

49:07.180 --> 49:11.180
And he checks this like, gel or goo.

49:11.180 --> 49:15.180
And if it's solid, it means it's going to be bad omens.

49:15.180 --> 49:17.180
And if it's, if it's liquid, it's a good omen.

49:17.180 --> 49:18.180
Did you know about this?

49:18.180 --> 49:21.180
This still happens, this just happened in 2024 in January.

49:21.180 --> 49:23.180
Oh my goodness.

49:23.180 --> 49:28.180
So the idea that they're not superstitious, but anyways, that's a, that's another top.

49:28.180 --> 49:34.180
But they, Christianity gets credited as being like, we're not as superstitious as these other pagans are.

49:34.180 --> 49:41.180
And it's almost like, but that movement started before Christianity even was on anyone's tongue.

49:41.180 --> 49:43.180
Read Cicero.

49:43.180 --> 49:46.180
Read, even before, let's go back even farther.

49:46.180 --> 49:56.180
This, the, the pre-Socratics, Heraclitus, in one of his fragments, Heraclitus has said, these people are worshiping idols and talking to them like they're real.

49:56.180 --> 49:58.180
You don't know anything about the gods.

49:58.180 --> 50:02.180
So there's that, that, that, that boat already sailed.

50:02.180 --> 50:12.180
That movement of like, looking, looking past superstitions and being more prop, being more pragmatic about, about the divine.

50:12.180 --> 50:17.180
That already, that's already a thing that's been 500 years in the making.

50:17.180 --> 50:18.180
Right.

50:18.180 --> 50:20.180
In some ways you could look at Christianity.

50:20.180 --> 50:23.180
I mean, it's, you could, there's nothing really new about Christianity.

50:23.180 --> 50:27.180
It's, it's just, it's, it's new in its configuration.

50:27.180 --> 50:31.180
It's new and it's in that way that it's kind of like the automobile.

50:31.180 --> 50:35.180
We had entrance, we had doors, we had windows, we had steering wheels.

50:35.180 --> 50:37.180
We had all that stuff.

50:37.180 --> 50:39.180
And now it comes together a certain way.

50:39.180 --> 50:42.180
Not that Christianity was this great invention or anything.

50:42.180 --> 50:44.180
It's its own odd jumble of goods.

50:44.180 --> 50:48.180
But no, these weren't, this wasn't a new innovation.

50:48.180 --> 50:53.180
In fact, when it came onto the scene, it was considered a pernicious superstition.

50:53.180 --> 50:56.180
That's, that's how, that was the natural reaction.

50:56.180 --> 50:57.180
It was looking at it.

50:57.180 --> 50:58.180
Yeah.

50:58.180 --> 50:59.180
Yeah.

50:59.180 --> 51:00.180
Yeah.

51:00.180 --> 51:06.180
And so dangerous, deadly even, I think in, in Tacitus, he refers to as a deadly superstition.

51:06.180 --> 51:07.180
Right.

51:07.180 --> 51:12.180
Which is so, which is so funny how they credit themselves as being the, the religion that

51:12.180 --> 51:14.180
got us away from all those superstitious pagans.

51:14.180 --> 51:19.180
But like, you read, you read the contemporary sources of the time period and they're the

51:19.180 --> 51:21.180
ones getting called that.

51:21.180 --> 51:24.180
So there's obviously, it's obviously way more complicated than that.

51:24.180 --> 51:29.180
And it's presented like in this very fairy tale like manner is that this, this Christianity

51:29.180 --> 51:35.180
religion against all odds was, you know, came up in the, and just miraculously became the

51:35.180 --> 51:39.180
religion of the entire, you know, Roman society.

51:39.180 --> 51:42.180
But like, you can see it's way more complicated than that.

51:42.180 --> 51:44.180
And there's way more moving parts happening.

51:44.180 --> 51:48.180
And there's, there's, there's Platonism and middle Platonism and philosophy involved behind

51:48.180 --> 51:53.180
the scenes and a lot of these different early Christian sex, like the so-called Gnostics.

51:53.180 --> 51:58.180
When you read their texts, it's very, it's very, they're like, they're, they're, they're,

51:58.180 --> 52:04.180
some of these sex, the, for example, the Carpacrations, they had images of Plato and

52:04.180 --> 52:05.180
Cyrus next to Jesus.

52:05.180 --> 52:12.180
So you're seeing like all these different movements coming out of philosophical traditions influencing

52:12.180 --> 52:13.180
theology.

52:13.180 --> 52:18.180
So what I'm noticing is as philosophy progresses, theology follows behind it.

52:18.180 --> 52:20.180
That's what it seems like is going on.

52:20.180 --> 52:21.180
Yeah.

52:21.180 --> 52:22.180
Yeah.

52:22.180 --> 52:24.180
Your thoughts on that.

52:24.180 --> 52:28.180
Well, I think that part of it is just the way people think.

52:28.180 --> 52:30.180
And so what, what are people doing?

52:30.180 --> 52:32.180
I mean, you're, we're talking about the discourse at this point.

52:32.180 --> 52:34.180
Like why, why isn't this being talked about?

52:34.180 --> 52:37.180
Why isn't this the in-depth exploration?

52:37.180 --> 52:44.180
The, the, why isn't this the all-consuming or primarily consuming project for New Testament

52:44.180 --> 52:45.180
work?

52:45.180 --> 52:49.180
Why is, what, well, why are people, what is the New Testament in the mind and psyche of

52:49.180 --> 52:51.180
our culture at this time?

52:51.180 --> 52:53.180
It is a bridge, a possible bridge.

52:53.180 --> 52:58.180
It presents a hope that possibly something beyond the natural exists, some, some kind

52:58.180 --> 53:04.180
of extra thing that maybe we can survive death, maybe, and, and so people are looking to this

53:04.180 --> 53:06.180
religion in that way.

53:06.180 --> 53:09.180
And so it's theologically tethered.

53:09.180 --> 53:14.180
And so the discussion in that way, you know, exploring, it's a lot of work.

53:14.180 --> 53:19.180
You want to, you know, if you had to as a New Testament, and this is kind of what I had

53:19.180 --> 53:20.180
to do.

53:20.180 --> 53:22.180
My, my work was transdisciplinary.

53:22.180 --> 53:27.180
I did like three master's degree programs and I had to study classics and I took all

53:27.180 --> 53:32.180
sorts of classics courses under classics, secular professors all over the place.

53:32.180 --> 53:37.180
And as you'll see there, my, my book was basically a reworking of my dissertation.

53:37.180 --> 53:42.180
I had three of my four dissertation committee members were classicists.

53:42.180 --> 53:47.180
They, you know, they could care less about the New Testament in so many ways.

53:47.180 --> 53:54.180
And so that's hard to get into their world and to become impressive in their world in

53:54.180 --> 53:59.180
terms of understanding, getting to a point where you can truly understand the classical

53:59.180 --> 54:01.180
Mediterranean world.

54:01.180 --> 54:08.180
And all of its, I mean, in some ways Judaism is, is by comparison, appears at least from

54:08.180 --> 54:16.180
my standpoint, like a tide pool compared sitting next to this vast sea that you have to learn

54:16.180 --> 54:22.180
and master and become immersed in in order to even feel like you understand what you're

54:22.180 --> 54:23.180
doing in that world.

54:23.180 --> 54:30.180
And so the more and more we do that, of course, the scandal is, is that it's not even like

54:30.180 --> 54:34.180
you would think people would put the flippers on and go swimming in that sea occasionally

54:34.180 --> 54:36.180
and at least make an effort.

54:36.180 --> 54:37.180
Right.

54:37.180 --> 54:44.180
And like I was talking to Derek the other day about Corinthians, first and second Corinthians.

54:44.180 --> 54:50.180
Well, Cassanius goes there and he walks around and looks at Corin and gives a vivid description

54:50.180 --> 54:51.180
of that.

54:51.180 --> 54:57.180
I mean, flaxes at seminaries on the Corinthian correspondences.

54:57.180 --> 55:01.180
Cassanius, I don't even think was mentioned.

55:01.180 --> 55:02.180
Right.

55:02.180 --> 55:03.180
Not even mentioned.

55:03.180 --> 55:05.180
Like what were we doing?

55:05.180 --> 55:09.180
I look back and I think what were we even talking about?

55:09.180 --> 55:10.180
Like,

55:10.180 --> 55:14.180
And by the way, he's a second century geographer.

55:14.180 --> 55:15.180
Right.

55:15.180 --> 55:18.180
See, that's a perfect source.

55:18.180 --> 55:19.180
Exactly.

55:19.180 --> 55:25.180
There's your archaeology for the ancient world, like from, from the sources standpoint, like

55:25.180 --> 55:27.180
you, you're right.

55:27.180 --> 55:33.180
He's walking around in the world that Christianity is growing in, at least middle second century

55:33.180 --> 55:34.180
time.

55:34.180 --> 55:35.180
He goes to Corinth.

55:35.180 --> 55:37.180
He goes to all these different ethicists.

55:37.180 --> 55:38.180
Right.

55:38.180 --> 55:39.180
I'm pretty sure he went to ethicists.

55:39.180 --> 55:43.180
But he's going all around the place and he's describing what's going on here.

55:43.180 --> 55:48.180
By the way, speaking of Pausanius, Pausanius goes to a city.

55:48.180 --> 55:49.180
I forgot where it is.

55:49.180 --> 55:54.180
It's somewhere in central Greece where they have a temple of Dionysus.

55:54.180 --> 56:03.180
And on the 5th of January, they take three jars of three empty jars and they leave them

56:03.180 --> 56:04.180
out in the sanctuary.

56:04.180 --> 56:08.180
And then the morning when they come in, they're filled with wine miraculously.

56:08.180 --> 56:12.180
Get this, early Orthodox church.

56:12.180 --> 56:16.180
This is, this is, I put this in one of my recent videos and I'm still wondering why this isn't

56:16.180 --> 56:17.180
talked about.

56:17.180 --> 56:21.180
There are, there are some scholars that wrote about this and they're in the classics world,

56:21.180 --> 56:22.180
believe it or not.

56:22.180 --> 56:31.180
But this is the early church, Orthodox church credits January 6th, the same day as the Epiphany

56:31.180 --> 56:37.180
and the same day as the Magi gets celebrated on and his birthday to some, you know how

56:37.180 --> 56:41.180
some Orthodoxy celebrates Christmas on January 6th.

56:41.180 --> 56:45.180
But they also say this is the same day of the wedding at Cana.

56:46.180 --> 56:47.180
Do you know this?

56:47.180 --> 56:48.180
No.

56:48.180 --> 56:55.180
And this is, Pausanias talks about this, this, this, this right that they perform where there's

56:55.180 --> 56:57.180
a miracle every year.

56:57.180 --> 57:04.180
And plainly younger, two second century sources that mentioned this particular festival of

57:04.180 --> 57:05.180
Dionysus.

57:05.180 --> 57:09.180
And you have, you have the wedding at Cana.

57:09.180 --> 57:11.180
And that's just one example.

57:11.180 --> 57:17.180
We talked about how in resurrections and Plutarch writes about this at length.

57:17.180 --> 57:19.180
You and I were talking about this recently.

57:19.180 --> 57:25.180
Plutarch starts naming off people who I haven't even heard of who supposedly died and their

57:25.180 --> 57:29.180
bodies disappeared and they were assumed divinity because of this.

57:29.180 --> 57:30.180
Yes.

57:30.180 --> 57:31.180
What happens to Jesus?

57:31.180 --> 57:37.180
He died, he gets put in a tomb and he disappears and he's assumed divine.

57:37.180 --> 57:40.180
That's a, that's a Mediterranean motif in general.

57:40.180 --> 57:44.180
Like that's, we're talking about the resurrection itself.

57:44.180 --> 57:50.180
I just recently heard, I just recently heard, and I love this, this scholar, Dan McClellan.

57:50.180 --> 57:52.180
I love Dan McClellan.

57:52.180 --> 57:57.180
But whenever he, whenever he gets into like Greek influence on Christianity, he just rejects

57:57.180 --> 57:58.180
it all outright.

57:58.180 --> 58:01.180
He just, it's like he's allergic to it.

58:01.180 --> 58:07.180
And I heard him just recently say this, there, you know, yeah, some of the stuff, some of

58:07.180 --> 58:12.180
the Greek stuff that the Christians are modeling and using to write their texts, but it has

58:12.180 --> 58:16.180
no, no influence on the Christian story or Christian tradition whatsoever.

58:16.180 --> 58:22.180
And I'm just thinking the resurrection, the way the resurrection is described is a Hellenistic

58:22.180 --> 58:24.180
motif that's all across the board.

58:24.180 --> 58:25.180
Romulus.

58:25.180 --> 58:26.180
Yeah.

58:26.180 --> 58:27.180
Yeah.

58:27.180 --> 58:30.180
Well, I've not read my book.

58:30.180 --> 58:35.180
That's, yeah, that's the, if there isn't, that's the whole point and thrust of my book

58:35.180 --> 58:38.180
is to lay that out in vivid detail.

58:38.180 --> 58:42.180
The, that that, in fact, the earliest Christians admit as much.

58:42.180 --> 58:47.180
That's their, they say this is what, and they interpret and receive that story in that way.

58:47.180 --> 58:49.180
That's why it's resurrection and reception.

58:49.180 --> 58:55.180
The, the reception of that story, the continuity, you could draw a through line from antiquity

58:55.180 --> 59:01.180
straight through Christianity into its later forms and see just how it evolves straight

59:01.180 --> 59:02.180
through that.

59:02.180 --> 59:05.180
It's an anthropological kind of project.

59:05.180 --> 59:08.180
New Testament scholars don't take anthropology.

59:08.180 --> 59:10.180
They don't even know what it is.

59:10.180 --> 59:11.180
No.

59:11.180 --> 59:12.180
They have no idea where that is.

59:12.180 --> 59:14.180
And this is the sad part.

59:14.180 --> 59:19.180
Early Christians are willing to talk about that stuff more than scholars today.

59:19.180 --> 59:26.180
Justin Marder, comparing Jesus to Hercules and Mithras and Dionysus and, and Mercury.

59:26.180 --> 59:30.180
He's compared, he's throwing all these comparisons out there because he's trying to like talk to

59:30.180 --> 59:36.180
his fellow Platonists that are, you know, that he wants to like, yeah, we're just like you guys.

59:36.180 --> 59:37.180
You can take.

59:37.180 --> 59:41.180
Now, Clement, Clement, Clement of Alexandria does this in his protracticus.

59:41.180 --> 59:44.180
You have, what's his name?

59:44.180 --> 59:45.180
Shit.

59:45.180 --> 59:46.180
Epiphanius.

59:46.180 --> 59:49.180
Epiphanius in the fifth century, when he writes the Panarion.

59:49.180 --> 59:56.180
He's talking about gods that are being celebrated as their birthday at the Winter Solstice.

59:56.180 --> 59:57.180
Right.

59:57.180 --> 59:58.180
Jesus.

59:58.180 --> 01:00:03.180
Like, well, how come early Christians are willing to go and do this type of comparison?

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:09.180
But scholars today who call themselves critical scholars won't want, don't want to go there.

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:10.180
Right.

01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:11.180
Justin Marder.

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:14.180
I mean, that's how, that's why I kick off my book with him is because he's going there

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:15.180
in spades.

01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:17.180
He's, that's his, his, he predicate.

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.180
In fact, he can't avoid that.

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:23.180
Any argument outside of that wouldn't have gotten gone anywhere at that in that world.

01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:29.180
So he's having to go ahead and get honest about that this is the bedrock upon which the resurrection

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:33.180
story and so forth is today, there was a move.

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:39.180
Like if you go back a hundred years, a century, there was there, the scholarship was at least

01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:49.180
in its best forms, moving pretty heavily into the, the classical Greek, Roman, Hellenistic

01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:56.180
society at that time to contextualize earliest Christian thought and texts.

01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:58.180
And so we see some of that.

01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:00.180
And we talked about Arthur Darby.

01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:07.180
He was about a century ago, exactly right now, actually, when he got his career going.

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:09.180
He's a marvelous example of that.

01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:15.180
But what you see is that get pushed up the academic tower.

01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:22.180
And so you see in the elite schools, like I want to, Professor Johnny Otis is one of the people that

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:28.180
endorses my book on the back, teaches at the advanced, the Center for Advanced Study at Princeton

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:31.180
University and the same place Einstein taught.

01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:35.180
That's, that's about as ivory tower as you can get.

01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:38.180
I mean, yeah, it's by invite only and you get to study there.

01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:44.180
If you've already earned your PhD and they'll invite you and they invite a couple of people a year.

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:46.180
And that's it or every now and then.

01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:49.180
And so Bowersock was one of them.

01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:51.180
You might have heard of that, that name in the past.

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:56.180
Another highly ivory tower type scholar that's super elite.

01:01:56.180 --> 01:02:00.180
So this conversation has been happening at that, at that higher level.

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:05.180
Harvard, some of these places, University of Chicago, Cambridge University.

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:08.180
You'll see the discourse continue through.

01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:13.180
But when you get closer to where the culture is at, like say in seminaries.

01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:14.180
Right.

01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:15.180
Nitty schools.

01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:16.180
SPL.

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:21.180
Yeah, there's a SPL for the most part.

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:27.180
It's almost like a novelty to even hear from those people that are steeped in that, that

01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:29.180
are presenting it within that.

01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:30.180
Yeah.

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:34.180
But this is what I, when I, okay.

01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:41.180
So I made a video recently about the Dionysian, not Dionysus, Jesus connections, Dionysian

01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:42.180
connection.

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:46.180
I think it's a better term because I'm talking about like the culture of the Dionysus culture

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:50.180
and the way the, the way they run their Ecclesias.

01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:54.180
And you know, Clappenborg's written about this as well.

01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:58.180
And I, I was surprised because I started the video up with a joke.

01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:00.180
The video was an introduction.

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:07.180
It was showing Dan McClellan refute on an online TikToker on the, you know, the Eucharist

01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:10.180
being having any, any Dionysian influence.

01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:13.180
And I just made a joke and I threw him in there.

01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:17.180
And as I'm researching for this video and I'm writing my script and I'm looking for sources

01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:21.180
from scholars, I, there's so many that I had to, I couldn't use them all.

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:23.180
There's so much scholarship on this subject.

01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:29.180
And what, what, what was so weird to me is Dan, when Dan McClellan talked about it, he

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:32.180
was saying, there's no scholars are talking about this.

01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:34.180
Like this is, this is nothing.

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:35.180
Nobody's ever written about this.

01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:36.180
I've never heard anything like this.

01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:37.180
This is nonsense.

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:39.180
The way, the way he said it.

01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:43.180
And I just want to, I'm looking up all these academic journals throughout the, throughout

01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:44.180
the years.

01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:46.180
There's so much written about this.

01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:49.180
And it was like, does he, did he just, does he just reject all this?

01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:51.180
Or does he not know about this?

01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:52.180
Like what's going on here?

01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:57.180
And I just think it's, I just think it's odd when you get a scholar who's very well,

01:03:57.180 --> 01:04:01.180
very well accredited like McClellan or Bart Ehrman.

01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:03.180
I'm throwing out names that I'm going to get in trouble.

01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:05.180
Oh, well, who cares?

01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:10.180
He just, you know, you know, no offense to Bart, but like, he wrote an article and it's

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:11.180
still up online.

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:15.180
It's still not corrected where he confuses diogenes with Demetrius.

01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:20.180
And it's like, where is, if you're not, we're not even getting names right.

01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:24.180
I mean, you're McClellan's, McClellan pronounced semile's name, semile.

01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:25.180
Semile.

01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:26.180
Semile.

01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:27.180
Wait.

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:31.180
So you're going to, you're going to stamp your foot down on the Dionysian aspects of Christianity.

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:34.180
If you don't even, but how do you not, you don't even know how to say semile.

01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:38.180
So how, and all I'm saying is this, I love Bart Ehrman.

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:39.180
I love Dan McClellan.

01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:43.180
I love all the stuff they do in New Testament, Old Testament, Hebrew stuff, all that stuff.

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:46.180
But like, if you just, sometimes you don't have to know everything.

01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:49.180
If you don't know something, just say, I don't know.

01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:53.180
Say, I've never heard anything like, I never heard the Dionysian aspects of Jesus.

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:57.180
It's, this is new to me, but I'm sure, you know, I'm sure there's someone who's written

01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:58.180
about, I don't know.

01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:03.180
But the way it was like, the way it's shot down, as if we, I know all this, don't even

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:05.180
look there, there's nothing to see here.

01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:09.180
Instead of being like, I'm not aware of it.

01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:11.180
That's all.

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:13.180
Well, it's a lack of training.

01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:16.180
If you think about it, I mean, I'm also an Ehrman fan.

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:19.180
You know, he's got a number of insights that have been helpful.

01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:23.180
And some, in some ways we run parallel and in certain regards, he went to Princeton

01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:24.180
Seminary.

01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:26.180
I did as well.

01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:32.180
But he's purely trained within the theological kind of training.

01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:35.180
That's your type of, type of scholarship.

01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:41.180
This is the most conservative guy that's Bennett, Princeton Seminary, that I know of.

01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:43.180
I met him before he passed away.

01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:46.180
Super nice guy, but let's get on this.

01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:51.180
That does not amount to a secular training in ancient history.

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:57.180
It's, it was a theological training within the Presbyterian tradition that they offer

01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:58.180
there.

01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:00.180
And it is, it is significant.

01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:05.180
And you do learn a lot there, but to say that that's going to then qualify you to speak

01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:10.180
on everything, you know, within the broader classical Mediterranean world.

01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:16.180
I think that requires more study and not that he's not capable of that and not be even

01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:21.180
pick on Bart, but he's, he's kind of representation of a larger phenomenology within the field

01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:27.180
where you've got these people that are trained at the Bindi schools and at seminaries all up

01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:34.180
and down that are at least weighing in heavily to where the, the, the central for us, the

01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:41.180
discourse are at and what, what we're going to say is normal or mainstream or acceptable.

01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:49.180
And so this idea of dismissing out of hand, whole categories of study.

01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:55.180
That's not what would be going on if this were a secular, you know, if this were ran as a

01:06:55.180 --> 01:07:01.180
secular topic and not a theological topic, but as a secular where historians and literary

01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:07.180
scholars studying another topic within antiquity, that would not be going on at all.

01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:13.180
And so our field is in morbid isolation from the secular humanities.

01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:17.180
And so we don't have to, we're not playing by the same rules as the rest of the academic

01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:18.180
world.

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:23.180
And I don't think we're as honest and that's not to pick on any particular person.

01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:27.180
I had to fight my way out of that all the way out to the end of my education to get out of it

01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:33.180
because I was trained at those same places and I had to finally for the last, you know,

01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:40.180
last several years of my education, just, you know, leading to get, get a UCLA and all these

01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:44.180
different places trying to get out of the Divinity schools and get into the classics departments

01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:48.180
to learn everything I can about that ancient world.

01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:54.180
And so I think that's, that's the problem is that you're, we're there.

01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:56.180
Also, it's, it's a lot of work.

01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:59.180
It deconstructs the New Testament in so many ways.

01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:01.180
It's dangerous.

01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:05.180
We live in a society that doesn't want all of this overturned.

01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:07.180
This, this is the living religion.

01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:14.180
I mean, in some ways, in some ways it's affecting like on a large scale, the war in Israel anyway,

01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:17.180
because people who support, I'm not, I'm not going to get political right now.

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:19.180
I'm not, I don't want you to either.

01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:27.180
But like, there are people who are influencing or supporting certain things happening in the world

01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:33.180
that are very detrimental to people due to religious belief.

01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:36.180
It's absolutely the case.

01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:37.180
Yeah.

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:39.180
And people hold, this is sacred history.

01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:40.180
It's not just history.

01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:42.180
It's sacred history in the minds of so many people.

01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:43.180
It's not for me.

01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:50.180
For me, it's, it's a very interesting to, I could get as much out of reading about Apollonius of Diana as I do about

01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:54.180
reading something out of Paul or some other place or place works.

01:08:54.180 --> 01:09:00.180
I could sit down if I want to, you know, personal kind of satisfaction or devotional kind of moment.

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:06.180
I could read just about anything in the ancient world and just and find enrichment.

01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:10.180
But for most society, I'm unique that way.

01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:12.180
I don't see myself as normal in that.

01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:19.180
Even though I ought to, I ought to see myself as normal in that way because it really is.

01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:25.180
When you have people to get through seminary, they have to sign a statement of faith.

01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:29.180
What you've done now, and this is something that still happens today in some of these seminaries,

01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:34.180
they have to sign a statement of faith to get their certificate or degree or whatever.

01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:38.180
And what you're doing is you're forcing them to lie no matter what.

01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:45.180
Either they have to lie for Jesus to promote Christianity or they have to lie against the statement of faith that they just signed.

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.180
This is so horrible.

01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:49.180
Why is this even still happening?

01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:54.180
It's beyond my, beyond anything I can imagine.

01:09:54.180 --> 01:10:04.180
And this is what I mean about like some of these dogmatic attitudes that we find in some of these circles of biblical scholarship are,

01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:10.180
they do have like a major impact on the world and some of this stuff happening because of your,

01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:16.180
your, your upholding, even if you're a critical scholar that rejects all, all miracles,

01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:22.180
but you're willing to just, just grant all the historicity parts.

01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:24.180
Like, yes, you see this with Bart a lot.

01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:28.180
Like, if it says it in the story, if we can't prove it otherwise, it probably happened then.

01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:32.180
It's kind of like, it seems like that's kind of like his, his attitude towards the text.

01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:34.180
Joseph probably was Jesus's father.

01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:35.180
Okay, whatever.

01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:40.180
Like, we're like, what, I'm not saying, like, I'm not, I'm not even like saying he's wrong, but I'm saying like,

01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:48.180
there's a lot of stuff that are assumed just to be true about the text, about the, about the cries of Christianity,

01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:56.180
that otherwise should, you think it should be more, more rigorous approach to this stuff.

01:10:56.180 --> 01:11:04.180
But then when it comes to like what we're talking about, when we're talking about the broader influences on this religion,

01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:10.180
now all of a sudden the burden of proof is higher and you need more, like, it's almost like, I don't know how to explain this, right?

01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:19.180
It's almost like certain things are accepted easily and other things are rejected and are not accepted as easy,

01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:24.180
based on the sort of attitude of biblical scholarship itself.

01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:34.180
And I think that goes, and a lot of the more conservative side of biblical scholarship, they sort of push that forward and it sort of gets,

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:38.180
and even the liberal scholar sort of kind of go along with it, it seems like.

01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:39.180
Well, yeah.

01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:46.180
Okay, so even the entire discourse is, is, is, is different in that regard.

01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:51.180
I mean, this whole conservative, liberal, and then I don't know what I'm supposed to be secular or some,

01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:54.180
we're just desparados up to the end of the discourse.

01:11:54.180 --> 01:12:03.180
Really, I'm just practicing the, all of the tools that I've learned in the trade, in terms of classical, any kind of,

01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:11.180
any per, anybody that's trying to investigate and describe classical antiquity in a secular kind of context, those,

01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:13.180
that's, that's what I'm bringing to this.

01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:17.180
I'm not trying to disturb anybody's faith necessarily, or anything like that.

01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:24.180
But I do want to go back and give these texts the same dignity that we would afford them in any other topic, right?

01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:25.180
Yeah.

01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:30.180
So, and use the same, the same measuring sticks, the same tools, the same methodologies.

01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:36.180
We don't assume Socrates said all this stuff that Plato's making him say.

01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:39.180
We go, wait, Plato making Socrates say this?

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:41.180
Is this something that fits the data?

01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:46.180
Let's compare it to what the other writer who writes about Socrates,

01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:50.180
what we can compare them, how they present Socrates and they're different.

01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:53.180
Like, okay, is Plato making Socrates say this?

01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:57.180
Is he turning Socrates into this specific character?

01:12:57.180 --> 01:13:01.180
Why isn't that same approach happening to New Testament?

01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:02.180
Wait a minute.

01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:04.180
Is the author making Jesus say this?

01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:08.180
Or is this really, it seems like that's, seems like the approach on which,

01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:12.180
how much we give credence to the story of the New Testament is a lot different

01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:16.180
than what we, what we would do in other aspects of different texts.

01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:18.180
Well, it's the sociology of it all.

01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:22.180
And that's really kind of, you talk to people that are out on the end of this,

01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:26.180
out on the edges, studying classics, and we are an odd bunch.

01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:29.180
You know, we're kind of porcupines.

01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:36.180
You're talking like Carrier or Litwa or, you know, Robin Faith Walsh is not a porcupine.

01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:40.180
She's a great example of somebody that tries to get along with everyone.

01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:42.180
But she gets much better too.

01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:44.180
She does, she does.

01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:49.180
And Dennis McDonald is a wonderful man that's treated people very well throughout his career,

01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:58.180
but he gets treated horribly back by so many, even though his intellectual pedigree is hard to match.

01:13:58.180 --> 01:13:59.180
Right.

01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:01.180
You know, Harvard trained all the way up the board.

01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:06.180
We're talking about somebody that's highly skilled and qualified to talk on these topics,

01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:08.180
and yet he's pushed to the margins.

01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:09.180
And so that's-

01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:13.180
And the criticisms they get, the criticisms they get are not valid.

01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:16.180
They don't actually check and read the stuff that they're talking about.

01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:19.180
They just say, huh, I've never heard that yet.

01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:20.180
That can't be right.

01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:21.180
Right.

01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:24.180
A seminary I went to, I'd never heard anything like that.

01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:25.180
That can't be true.

01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:26.180
That's bizarre.

01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:27.180
That's the sort of-

01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:28.180
Right.

01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:32.180
That's the sort of mentality that I'm noticing when it comes to the pushback against the Robin-

01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:34.180
Robin Faith Walsh's and Dennis McDonald's.

01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:36.180
It's almost like there's no-

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:39.180
The pushback is just, uh-uh.

01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:40.180
Well, it's fallacy.

01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:41.180
Yeah.

01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:43.180
The idea that I see this all the time online.

01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:48.180
I'll see people mention some of the people that you've listed in there or more myself,

01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:50.180
even in other contexts.

01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:57.180
It's, um, well, that's not the mainstream view or, you know, they're very, you know,

01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:02.180
no one, very few have embraced that theory or something like this.

01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:04.180
As if that's a fallacy.

01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:06.180
That's a fallacious kind of thought.

01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:07.180
Yeah.

01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:08.180
Yeah.

01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:11.180
I can't tell you how many times I've heard people say, that's not the consensus.

01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:12.180
Okay.

01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:17.180
And is that, is that, is the consensus true?

01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:18.180
Right.

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:19.180
Look at the argument.

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:20.180
Let's deal.

01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:21.180
Let's look at the text.

01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:24.180
Is this a plausible, even if you don't believe it?

01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:25.180
Is it plausible?

01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:26.180
Let's start there.

01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:27.180
Right.

01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:31.180
And the very least, Dennis McDonald and Robin Faith Wallace, the stuff they're saying,

01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:32.180
beyond plausible.

01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:35.180
It's absolutely plausible.

01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:39.180
So like, you can't even say it's not plausible, even if you think it's wrong.

01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:41.180
But they, they act like it's just like impossible.

01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:42.180
This can't be true.

01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:43.180
I never heard this.

01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:45.180
I was never trained this way.

01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:50.180
It's like, it's just be, it goes outside of the scope of, of the sort of mentality of,

01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:53.180
of New Testament scholarship.

01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:55.180
My work is, is even given a worse treatment in some ways.

01:15:55.180 --> 01:16:00.180
I mean, I've had many, many, I mean, it's required reading in Harvard last time I checked.

01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:01.180
At least it used to be.

01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:06.180
And there are a number of places where it is taken very seriously in certain circles,

01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:08.180
especially in the high academies.

01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:16.180
But largely it's, it's seen as a, you know, that I must be just off out into outer space

01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:17.180
doing my own thing.

01:16:17.180 --> 01:16:19.180
And really what's going on there.

01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:24.180
I mean, I've, if you, if you look at it, so I'm doing memesis criticism a lot like Dennis

01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:27.180
in some ways, but it's cultural rather than literary.

01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:30.180
That's my kind of methodological lens throughout the book.

01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:33.180
And, but also what is the other thing?

01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:35.180
It's dismantling tacitly.

01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:41.180
Now it wasn't my aim necessarily, but it's tacitly dismantling the reason anyone's even

01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:45.180
reading the New Testament to begin with, for the most part, and that is because of this

01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:48.180
hope for afterlife or survival of death.

01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:53.180
And in, in, in some ways, if you, if you, if my, if I'm correct in there all the way

01:16:53.180 --> 01:17:00.180
across that particular perspective, and I am just, just to give you that confidence

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:05.180
from my side, I am correct that that, that should be, and it was the interpretation.

01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:09.180
That's how these texts were received originally.

01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:15.180
Then you have to concede that this was mythology or mythmaking in some way and that it was

01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:16.180
cultic, cult for that.

01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:21.180
They was using the same cultic raw materials that were available at that time to build

01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:22.180
an early cult.

01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:27.180
It wasn't, they weren't trying to create a, a this really happened kind of movement.

01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:32.180
They were creating a cultic movement with cultic storytelling with a founder and that

01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:37.180
was mythologized as, as Pliny says in his texts that, that they were singing hymns to

01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:42.180
him as, as to a God, which was, you know, within that's, that's the categories that,

01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:45.180
that, that they were able to conceive of this.

01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:47.180
And that was the very categories that had sprung up.

01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:54.180
And so if you think about that, that even biases and even one step further for me where

01:17:54.180 --> 01:18:00.180
most of SPL could never accept my thesis out of hand.

01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:02.180
They don't even, before they even open the book.

01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:04.180
Well, you want to know what, want to know what it is.

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:10.180
I think when, when somebody writes a book and they put it out there and it gets accepted

01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:14.180
and becomes part of their, it becomes a part of their identity is like, this is the, this

01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:19.180
is their, but when you write something and it goes and it pushes up, pushes up against

01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:23.180
some of their stuff, they, it's almost like they have to reject it.

01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:25.180
Cause that this is my identity.

01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:27.180
They're dealing with, they're going to, they're going to make me look like a fraud.

01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:28.180
If he's right now, I'm wrong.

01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:29.180
I'm a fraud.

01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:34.180
So you have, you have a monetary, there's like monetary reasons behind it, not just monetary,

01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:39.180
but there's, there's reasons why people automatically will shut down.

01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:43.180
If, if you're saying something that goes against what they've been saying and they're, and they're

01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:46.180
supposed to be the expert and you're going against that, they're going to, they're, they're

01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:50.180
naturally going to, naturally going to try to find ways to shut it down.

01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:52.180
You almost can't blame them.

01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:57.180
If Dennis is right, I mean, going back to him, if he's right, that Homeric and Mimesis

01:18:57.180 --> 01:19:03.180
and, and other Mimesis in the New Testament is rampant or even occurring at all a whole

01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:08.180
lot, then that means that almost every commentary, pretty much every commentary that's been

01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:14.180
written up to this point in modern academic work on the New Testament needs to be pretty

01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:17.180
much probably thrown in the waste can.

01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:22.180
It's, it's so far off at that point that we don't even know what we're doing.

01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:29.180
And so, yeah, and that's for people to admit that, think about this, you go and you get

01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:33.180
your PhD and then you come out the other end and you're presented with something that's

01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:37.180
so far outside of anything you were trained in.

01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:46.180
Yeah, that's what I, that's what I think is the main driving force behind the pushback

01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:51.180
is you get people who go to school for eight to 10 years, they get a PhD in theology and

01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:56.180
religions and then they, that whole entire time that they were in seminary and they learn

01:19:56.180 --> 01:20:01.180
what they learned and they're, they're being trained to only look at this area right here.

01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:05.180
Look at the density schools, look at this, look at the Septuagint, look at the Old Testament,

01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:08.180
look at the Maserati texts and that's their world.

01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:13.180
And then they, a couple of years down the road, you know, they write some academic articles,

01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:17.180
they get, they get their name out there, they're, they're a real professional scholar now.

01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:24.180
All of a sudden somebody comes along and says something completely opposite, completely different.

01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:28.180
Imagine that, you'd be like, I've never heard anything like this, this can't be true.

01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:33.180
Because if it's true, I would have heard it in my years of going to seminary.

01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:36.180
Well, sorry, but that's not the way it works.

01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:39.180
Either the data suggests, the data is there or it's not.

01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:44.180
So we need to like start off as, as what they're saying, even plausible at first.

01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:47.180
If it is, then you should look at it.

01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:53.180
Right, that's what my, my whole, my, my whole theory that I ran with in book, you know,

01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:59.180
that basically the translation fable, it's, you really have to take a fresh run at it.

01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:03.180
I had to get to the, I got to the point when I was writing it, I started, in my mind,

01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:09.180
I was having all of these arguments with all of the supposed leading scholars of our time.

01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:11.180
They were New Testament folks.

01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:13.180
And I got to the point where I was just, it was just maddening.

01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:16.180
I just thought, you know what, that's a waste.

01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:18.180
None of them have studied Plutar.

01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:20.180
They don't know any of this.

01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:22.180
They haven't studied this sufficiently.

01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:28.180
So for me to have this long involved conversation with people that don't even know.

01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:29.180
They're not even looking at it.

01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:36.180
They're just assuming that if their, if their favorite scholar or their, the academics that they look up to,

01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:38.180
if they're not saying this, then it can't be true.

01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:39.180
Right.

01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:41.180
It's like this weird dog.

01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:44.180
It's like this weird dogma.

01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:49.180
I think dogma is the best word to put it because they're not actually engaging with the material.

01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:53.180
They're just, they're just engaging with it with a, well, I never heard that yet.

01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:54.180
So that can't be real.

01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:56.180
If this person doesn't agree, then I don't agree.

01:21:56.180 --> 01:21:57.180
Right.

01:21:57.180 --> 01:21:58.180
So I don't even have to read.

01:21:58.180 --> 01:22:01.180
I'm not even going to read the past that he's, that he's highlighting.

01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:02.180
I'm not even going to look at that Greek.

01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:03.180
I'm not even going to do this.

01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:09.180
I'm just going to assume that he's wrong because this person said he was wrong and sort of this person.

01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:12.180
It starts, it starts a whole domino effect.

01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:18.180
And next thing you know, you have a whole consensus of scholars saying that you're wrong.

01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:20.180
The consensus says that Richard Miller is wrong.

01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:24.180
I'm not saying that's happening, but I'm saying like that's, that's what comes out of it.

01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:32.180
When one person just outright denying it and that person being on top of a pyramid of scholars under that person,

01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:33.180
and they're all just going to follow suit.

01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:37.180
And that's just that to me, it seems like that's what's happening a lot.

01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:38.180
You become a symbol.

01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:45.180
I mean, people carry around in their minds, usually these little like caricatures and little cocktail neck and sketches of what somebody,

01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:51.180
if you go back and read Rudolph Wolfman, he doesn't look a lot like the cocktail neck and sketch of what people, you know,

01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:56.180
he's kind of a poogie man in so many, you know, religious training context.

01:22:56.180 --> 01:23:00.180
But if you go back and actually read him, you know, it's not like the same thing with Dennis McDonald.

01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:01.180
You go back and read him.

01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:07.180
I've talked to a number of people that, you know, rejected him out of hand when read his book and that, oh, okay.

01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:10.180
Yeah, this is compelling.

01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:12.180
That's right.

01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:24.180
Some of these earlier scholars that I've since been built upon, but also like rejected, you know, the France Cumans of the, you know,

01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:29.180
the Mithraic studies, you got James Fraser, you have, and then they get lumped.

01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:35.180
So these people, I'm not saying that these people are correct in everything they said, they said a lot of stuff that I would disagree with.

01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:46.180
But they get lumped in with like the DuPuis and the, like the really bad mythocyst type stuff from the 18th, 19th centuries, early 20th centuries.

01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:48.180
And they just all get lumped in together.

01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:54.180
And like, but like, if you actually read France Cumans, most of the stuff he's putting down is legit.

01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:58.180
He's like the greatest Mithraic scholar prior to ever live.

01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:06.180
And then James Fraser, he gets a lot of crap for some of the stuff that people just like, oh, that's James Fraser type of stuff.

01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:08.180
What's so bad about James Fraser?

01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:10.180
I mean, yeah, his stuff's outdated.

01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:13.180
Yeah, it's older, but it's pretty good if you read it.

01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:14.180
Right.

01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:15.180
I won't say that about DuPuis.

01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:18.180
DuPuis, that book is trash.

01:24:18.180 --> 01:24:19.180
That book is horrible.

01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:22.180
It's just taking stuff up out of the thin air.

01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:31.180
So I do get, I do understand why there is some pushback against outdated material, but it almost seems, I don't know that you get, you get the point.

01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:38.180
Yeah, I think that it's, it's for lack of knowledge, it's kind of contempt prior to investigation.

01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:51.180
And, and also what would it, you know, if you've got people that are predicating their careers on their social kind of positioning within the larger topography.

01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:57.180
Of this field, this career.

01:24:57.180 --> 01:25:12.180
Why hazard that by hitching your, your career to a bunch of work that potentially threatens your reputation threatens your, your student reviews.

01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:20.180
It, it isolates you or, you know, put you off on the margins, you're going to become pariah.

01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:22.180
This kind of thing.

01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:23.180
Why do that?

01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:30.180
Well, the reason you do it is because you're supposed to be a scholar and not somebody that's playing a social game with your career.

01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:36.180
But unfortunately, that's mostly what's going on with this because it is a social religion.

01:25:36.180 --> 01:25:37.180
There's heresy.

01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:38.180
There's orthodoxy.

01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:53.180
There's all of these different paradigms and the winds that govern that even within the larger trust of Western academic history and ecclesiastical history are determining a lot of this, even the language that we use.

01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:55.180
Like we went back to Pagan, this idea, Pagans.

01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:57.180
There's so much more than that.

01:25:57.180 --> 01:25:59.180
What's biblical Greek?

01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:03.180
You know, that's not, it's not a thing.

01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:06.180
It's made up.

01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:08.180
Yeah, biblical lexicon.

01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:09.180
What is that?

01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:10.180
It doesn't exist.

01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:12.180
There was no such thing.

01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:19.180
So it's, we're putting, we're drawing these lines and a lot of that is, is coming out.

01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:23.180
We're inheriting that from a larger power discourse.

01:26:23.180 --> 01:26:26.180
Why are there even New Testament scholars at all?

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:35.180
Why, why would there be this group that's certified to be able to speak on this topic as if it were different than earliest?

01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:37.180
This is just earliest Christian literature.

01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:39.180
Why isn't, why aren't these just early Christian scholars?

01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:41.180
Why aren't they just classes?

01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:42.180
You know, right?

01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:48.180
It should be Mediterranean, Mediterranean religions with like my main focus being New Testament or something.

01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:49.180
Right.

01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:52.180
It goes back to Foucault.

01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:53.180
Yeah.

01:26:53.180 --> 01:27:04.180
It goes back to Foucault and the kind of the way we, the power lines that we draw, the power discourse and the way that we divide up, who gets to speak on what.

01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:14.180
And those are all arbitrary lines that don't have, they're actually bringing about violence and vandalizing the discussion.

01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:17.180
And they're not helpful.

01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:19.180
And so.

01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:20.180
Yeah.

01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:24.180
I mean, this has been a great conversation so far.

01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:25.180
I couldn't agree more.

01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:31.180
It's good to see that, like, because I can't determine that I'm correct and they're wrong.

01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:46.180
Because as someone who's not trained, and I've only been really like going at this for a few years to probably three to four years now, like really, really like very much like doing it on a regular basis every day pretty much.

01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:51.180
Learning Greek, learning a little bit of Hebrew, reading the sources.

01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:54.180
And my main thing is more, I do read academic articles.

01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:59.180
I shouldn't say I don't, but I love to read the primary sources the most.

01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:05.180
Now, for me, I can't determine that I know things and they're wrong.

01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:12.180
I have to like, I have to assume that I could have holes in my own thinking, and maybe they're correct.

01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:15.180
And I just haven't gotten to where they're at yet.

01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:28.180
But when I see people like you and Dennis McDonald and Robin, you know, just not even just just classics departments and Egyptologists that have the same sort of.

01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:36.180
I was talking to Egyptologists recently, who was like mind blown that Christians don't talk about Halaria more.

01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:45.180
Halaria was a festival that was celebrated all across the Mediterranean around the winter at the time of the spring equinox.

01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:47.180
And it's a resurrection festival.

01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:50.180
So it doesn't mean that Jesus didn't exist.

01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:56.180
And this is all what I'm saying, like that motif or that sort of influence could have had some influence on.

01:28:56.180 --> 01:29:04.180
I'm just saying like, this is what Egyptologists and the Egyptologists was very humble about it and saying, well, I'm not a New Testament scholar, so they probably had the reasons.

01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:07.180
But it just seems like to me, it seems like there's something going on here.

01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:15.180
And I'm just thinking imagine if somebody you put that together with some of the stuff that people are learning in New Testament, there might be something to look at here.

01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:17.180
I'm just just an example.

01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:22.180
Well, I'll go ahead and say it.

01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:24.180
They are wrong. They should be studying these things.

01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:27.180
They ought to be out there in studying the heck out of it.

01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:39.180
If you're going to claim to be an expert in something, then you should go ahead and invest yourselves in immersing yourselves in the ancient thought world of where these texts got their traction.

01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:42.180
Where were the communities at?

01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:48.180
These were the cultural hubs of the ancient classical Mediterranean world, the ancient Roman world.

01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:59.180
And yet very few in our field really have anything approaching a vivid understanding of those contexts in any way, in any form.

01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:02.180
And so it's very rare, actually.

01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:06.180
And so that to me is embarrassing.

01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:07.180
It's embarrassing to the field.

01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:10.180
And that's why classicists don't show up to SBL.

01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:14.180
That's why literary scholars aren't showing up to SBL.

01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:25.180
That's why a lot of these Assyrian, Assyriologists, ancient Near Eastern studies folks aren't showing up to SBL a lot.

01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:38.180
They don't see this as a safe, as a normal place where they could set up a shop and have discussions about the ancient world in any kind of honest context.

01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:43.180
Because they're around people that aren't trained in that way.

01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:45.180
And it's a loaded topic.

01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:47.180
It's full of all sorts of people that are there.

01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:52.180
Most of the people at SBL are there because they're on some sort of religious pilgrimage.

01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:55.180
And that's why they got their education to begin with.

01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:59.180
And this is just where they happened to be, where it all got to at this point.

01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:03.180
And so that's not everyone, but that's a lot of it.

01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:07.180
And so that's not happening in any other field.

01:31:07.180 --> 01:31:10.180
No other field is described that way.

01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:18.180
And so I guess the closest you can get would be politics or something like that, or that's also highly loaded and charged topic.

01:31:18.180 --> 01:31:26.180
But, you know, I don't think there's anything else really that comes close to what's going on with this discourse.

01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:36.180
And so, you know, it's funny you said that because if we were looking at religions in India, they're all on the same language Sanskrit.

01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:43.180
They're in the same geographical location, and they have the same sort of similar stories going on.

01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:45.180
There's some overlap here.

01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:50.180
We would, okay, we would already be dissecting it and looking at stuff and comparing them all.

01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:59.180
But for some reason, in this region of Asia Minor and Greece, where Constantinople is, where Byzantium was,

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:09.180
we can't assume that the religions that precede Christianity in that region have any effect on the culture.

01:32:09.180 --> 01:32:14.180
We're just going to assume that they just rejected their ancestors' culture and started a new thing there.

01:32:14.180 --> 01:32:16.180
You would never do that anywhere else.

01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:23.180
It's only in this part of the world where we assume that this special religion has got a force field around it,

01:32:23.180 --> 01:32:25.180
and there's no influence from anywhere.

01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:32.180
Even if it's the same geographical location, the same language using the same motifs and imagery and symbolism and all that stuff.

01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:33.180
Right.

01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:39.180
No, it goes beyond absurdity, really, if you think about it from much at all.

01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:47.180
When I wrote, I decided that I was going to write for a future generation where this was not the case.

01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:51.180
I had this persona in my mind.

01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:55.180
How could my book be respected, like say, in 50 years?

01:32:55.180 --> 01:33:08.180
Say we get past this, and our field is more secular, it's more true to the humanities and the normal processes and rigor that you could put around any other topic.

01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:21.180
I had to try and aim for that as future readers, when they read my work, will they find it true and honest and compelling and correct and helpful, etc.

01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:26.180
And so I decided to target that as kind of my readership for the book.

01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:34.180
And that's a shame, because largely it has to do with, there's all sorts of reasons for that.

01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:39.180
SPL invites just about anyone to go and be participant.

01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:42.180
There's almost no constraints on anything that goes on there.

01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:54.180
And so I heard one fellow gay that got up and gave a discussion on how true all the miracle, now we know that the miracles in the New Testament really happened.

01:33:54.180 --> 01:33:56.180
And here's the proof of it.

01:33:56.180 --> 01:33:59.180
And he got a standing ovation.

01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:01.180
Of course.

01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:16.180
Yeah, standing ovation. And I thought, okay, well, first, that's not true, because my own training and study shows that this would have been part and parcel with other ancient miracle and Mirabilia tales of the ancient.

01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:22.180
So first off, they're driving the conversation a completely faith interested direction.

01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:37.180
And, and secondly, and what other, in what other contexts, what are their academic context, it'd be like going to the British, you know, the Royal Royal Society and having, you know, they're, they're meeting their annual meeting and they're

01:34:37.180 --> 01:34:49.180
talking about King Arthur and somebody gets up and talks about the historicity of Merlin, or something like this, and everyone gives a standing ovation.

01:34:49.180 --> 01:35:02.180
It's really our time. It's an embarrassing time. And if you, I think future generations will look back on us and see what we've done, we basically, we're funding the academic legitimation of our own mythosystem.

01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:04.180
Right.

01:35:04.180 --> 01:35:10.180
And then that, and then like I said, and that in turn plays a huge role in a lot of things that happened throughout the world.

01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:18.180
As a result, they're like, upholding some things that are that are affecting world events.

01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:38.180
That's right. That's right. This is actually at risk. The future, the it's an existential threat by, by, you know, by possible relation, it's an exit, it produces a certain existential threats to our own species, in some ways, to not have clarity on these

01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:40.180
issues is embarrassing.

01:35:40.180 --> 01:35:41.180
Yep.

01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:42.180
Well said.

01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:43.180
Yeah.

01:35:43.180 --> 01:35:54.180
So I just want to throw, throw out another link. There's links in the description for the book, resurrection and reception early Christianity, any other projects you got coming up coming up that you want to promote right now.

01:35:54.180 --> 01:36:12.180
Well, I'm working on a book that has to do with the criminal aspects of earliest Christianity, you know, why are people getting thrown into prison and killed and so forth. Is it just because the Roman for monsters and all these trials were rigged and kangaroo trials and all that or were there actual laws being broken?

01:36:12.180 --> 01:36:31.180
And maybe even intentionally being broken. And, and so it complicates the picture in some ways of the innocent kind of birth of Christianity. But I think that's another one I my tendency is to look where no one else is going the taboo topic, because that's where

01:36:31.180 --> 01:36:49.180
usually the treasure's at. That's where the insights are at that haven't been really explored yet that really do balance picture and give it a lot more, make it a lot more true to the actual ancient world and and the rise of the religion.

01:36:49.180 --> 01:37:00.180
So that's something that I'm exploring right now. I'm reaching out to other scholars and maybe maybe a joint project. And so if any of your viewers get excited about the topic.

01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:10.180
Sounds great. And once again, this is a great discussion. Thanks for coming on and you have to take true noses.

01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:21.180
Yeah.
