00:00.000 --> 00:07.720
Welcome back to the Gnostic Informant and you are about to attain true gnosis and today

00:07.720 --> 00:10.040
we're going to go deep again.

00:10.040 --> 00:13.840
As you know, I have Dr. Amon with me.

00:13.840 --> 00:20.800
And if you haven't yet subscribed, go to Lady Babylon, hit that subscribe button.

00:20.800 --> 00:28.040
This is, this is one, there's only one place in the world where you're going to find content

00:28.040 --> 00:29.040
like this.

00:29.040 --> 00:30.840
And I'm not joking.

00:30.840 --> 00:39.680
This is a perfect, this is a real classical philologist who is trained in the ancient

00:39.680 --> 00:46.840
classical Greek languages, who also studies the, the, the drugs.

00:46.840 --> 00:47.840
What do I mean by that?

00:47.840 --> 00:50.280
Well, I'll just pull, I'll just give you an example.

00:50.280 --> 00:53.160
He wrote, kind of a commuse.

00:53.160 --> 00:55.600
This is a big hit.

00:55.600 --> 01:01.240
As you can see, you know, the times UK said, this is the last wild frontier of classical

01:01.240 --> 01:02.240
studies.

01:02.240 --> 01:06.000
And you can get it right here on Amazon, links in the description.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.120
The ancient world is not what you think.

01:08.120 --> 01:13.200
I mean, just imagine if we had the like, I don't know, Lord of the Rings, but it was

01:13.200 --> 01:16.600
rated R and there's prostitutes and drugs everywhere.

01:16.600 --> 01:25.640
That's the ancient world that we don't, that we lost through a thousand years of the church.

01:25.640 --> 01:30.520
But the ancient world before the church was a different place and we lose a lot of the

01:30.520 --> 01:31.960
context of that.

01:31.960 --> 01:35.120
When this, and that's what Dr. Amon brings to the table.

01:35.120 --> 01:39.520
He reminds, he's reminding the world of what the ancients were doing.

01:39.520 --> 01:44.760
And he brings a lot of context that is needed in my opinion when I'm looking into stuff

01:44.760 --> 01:45.760
that I do.

01:45.920 --> 01:48.120
Also, he offers his services.

01:48.120 --> 01:53.520
And as you can see, he's a PhD in classics, he's got five stars, perfect rating out of

01:53.520 --> 01:56.360
378 ratings.

01:56.360 --> 02:01.400
You can hit the link in the description if you want to learn classical Greek or Latin.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.600
He does both.

02:03.600 --> 02:07.960
Let's just go down real quick just to see some of these reviews.

02:07.960 --> 02:09.800
Learning is easy to Professor David.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.960
He makes it fun and interesting.

02:11.960 --> 02:13.800
Learning is quick and very smooth.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.080
That was me, by the way.

02:15.120 --> 02:17.840
Four lessons I've done so far.

02:17.840 --> 02:19.840
Knowledgeable is an understatement.

02:19.840 --> 02:24.320
Amon is able to take me through ancient Greek in a way that other teacher could.

02:24.320 --> 02:27.840
I am comfortable learning with Amon and look forward to continuing.

02:27.840 --> 02:35.480
There is countless, countless people who have left five stars and who are continuing to

02:35.480 --> 02:39.320
get learning languages from Dr. Amon.

02:39.320 --> 02:44.360
So with that being said, make sure you hit those subscribes, check out those links.

02:44.360 --> 02:49.920
And we are going to have an amazing, amazing show tonight.

02:49.920 --> 02:54.120
We're going to go deep into the stuff that they do not tell you in church.

02:54.120 --> 02:58.160
Let me repeat that.

02:58.160 --> 03:01.800
You will not hear this in church.

03:01.800 --> 03:02.400
Hit the intro.

03:44.360 --> 04:11.200
All right, here's without further ado, Dr. Amon, what is going on?

04:11.200 --> 04:14.560
Neil, the great informant of the gnosis.

04:14.560 --> 04:18.160
Yes, it's good to see you and thank you for having me on.

04:18.160 --> 04:23.240
It's always, I'm always jumping at the chance to come on and address your audience.

04:23.240 --> 04:25.320
So thank you for having me.

04:25.320 --> 04:26.320
Absolutely.

04:26.320 --> 04:31.160
I can't wait to get into this topic because as you guys know in the thumbnail, gangster

04:31.160 --> 04:35.680
Jesus, some of you might be like, come on, that's a cheap shot.

04:35.680 --> 04:40.000
But wait, this is, there's something to this thing.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.040
He is a boaster.

04:42.040 --> 04:44.040
He is not playing around.

04:44.040 --> 04:48.520
The Jesus you get in church is, you know, love your neighbor as you love yourself.

04:48.520 --> 04:51.360
And the greatest thing you can do is love.

04:51.360 --> 04:59.920
But that's, that's part of his schizophrenic, if you will, message that flips on a dime and

04:59.920 --> 05:06.040
he'll just randomly snap and then brag about going after Jezebel and throwing her on a

05:06.040 --> 05:12.400
table to rape her and then killing your children and then saying, I am the morning star, bitch.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.520
And like, we're going to get into these texts right now.

05:14.520 --> 05:16.240
You're probably running, what, what are you talking about?

05:16.240 --> 05:17.880
What text is this?

05:17.880 --> 05:19.760
And that's what we're about to bring you right now.

05:19.760 --> 05:22.360
So let's get into it.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.880
This is the Bible thug life, man.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.280
This is the thug life of the Bible.

05:27.280 --> 05:33.920
When I started dipping into the drugs and antiquity and the prostitution and these cult rights

05:33.920 --> 05:34.920
and stuff.

05:34.920 --> 05:37.280
Yeah, you see a lot of thuggery.

05:37.280 --> 05:38.280
Yeah.

05:38.280 --> 05:39.960
So this is a great topic.

05:39.960 --> 05:41.760
Let's bring it all out.

05:41.760 --> 05:42.760
All out.

05:42.760 --> 05:43.760
Good.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.760
Absolutely.

05:44.760 --> 05:45.760
Good.

05:45.760 --> 05:50.320
I want to, can I throw up first and I more want to present this to you and then you have,

05:50.320 --> 05:54.280
you give me meal, your thing, because people like this love between us.

05:54.280 --> 05:55.280
Yeah.

05:55.280 --> 05:57.280
I'm going to pump up your energy.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.720
We're going to bounce you back and forth.

05:59.720 --> 06:00.720
All right.

06:00.720 --> 06:01.720
Let's go.

06:02.720 --> 06:05.840
That first email, the Peter kills Ananias, right?

06:05.840 --> 06:06.840
Yeah.

06:06.840 --> 06:07.840
Right.

06:07.840 --> 06:16.280
So there was a certain guy named Ananias and his wife was Sapphira, right?

06:16.280 --> 06:21.320
Anyway, he sold some land, some of his own goods he sold, right?

06:21.320 --> 06:25.400
This is usually like a building upon a piece of land or something.

06:25.400 --> 06:31.600
He's got some cash there going and he, like everybody else, he sells it, right?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.640
And he only gave a part.

06:33.640 --> 06:37.560
He only gave a part of it to Peter, right?

06:37.560 --> 06:43.800
And so Peter says, Hey, what are you filled with Satan, you know, that you got this thing

06:43.800 --> 06:48.640
in your heart, that you're lying to the spirit of God, that you, you kept some of this stuff

06:48.640 --> 06:50.520
back, bro.

06:50.520 --> 06:51.760
And yeah.

06:51.760 --> 06:57.200
And that's where it gets weird because he falls down right away.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.400
He falls down and dies.

06:59.400 --> 07:00.400
Wow.

07:00.440 --> 07:01.440
Yeah.

07:01.440 --> 07:06.560
You're in this X Epsuchsen, X Epsuchsen.

07:06.560 --> 07:15.240
And it uses a weird word there, uses a very weird word there, neo for to die.

07:15.240 --> 07:22.720
It's used by the doctors on the side of the medical tax for losing a heart rate, a stable

07:22.720 --> 07:27.840
heart rate, because they were all, they were all into the pulse and whatnot.

07:27.840 --> 07:33.440
And so it has to do with some kind of cardiac event, right?

07:33.440 --> 07:34.600
And so there he is.

07:34.600 --> 07:35.600
That makes sense.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.640
Why he hits the ground, right?

07:37.640 --> 07:38.800
As dead.

07:38.800 --> 07:44.600
And the text says that this, this message went out, man.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.600
People stood in fear.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.400
People were afraid because of this.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.400
Yeah.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.800
And then he brings in his wife.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.920
Same thing happens to his wife.

07:53.920 --> 07:56.000
She hits the ground.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
And he tells her.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.080
It's so good.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.080
He can tell her.

07:59.080 --> 08:02.400
He says, we just took your husband out and buried him just like we're going to bury

08:02.400 --> 08:03.400
you.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.960
And boom, she hits the ground.

08:04.960 --> 08:09.800
Now what's funny that people don't point out is there are some neoniscoy, right?

08:09.800 --> 08:12.600
There's some neoteroi there.

08:12.600 --> 08:15.840
These are the new initiates.

08:15.840 --> 08:19.040
These are the people who've just started into the cult, right?

08:19.040 --> 08:24.880
Who were just in the family, calling people brother and they sit there and they do what

08:24.880 --> 08:27.040
Peter tells them to do.

08:27.040 --> 08:33.680
So somehow Peter had this interaction and in both cases, in both cases, he was able to

08:33.680 --> 08:37.880
get them to die on cue, right?

08:37.880 --> 08:47.920
When you sin against that pluma, that is a sin that is performed within the right.

08:47.920 --> 08:53.440
That's the only thing that can't be pardoned is a sin within the right.

08:53.440 --> 08:59.560
And if you took that poison without taking the antidote, you were dead.

08:59.560 --> 09:04.280
And if Peter didn't give it to you, that's it.

09:04.280 --> 09:05.280
Yeah.

09:05.280 --> 09:11.600
And I want to throw something out here too because this is coming from the chapter where

09:11.600 --> 09:19.800
these new initiates, they sold their property and they gave away most of the funds to the

09:19.800 --> 09:25.400
church or the assembly and kept a little bit for themselves.

09:25.400 --> 09:26.480
And that was enough.

09:26.480 --> 09:27.980
That was not cool.

09:27.980 --> 09:29.760
They were not playing around.

09:29.760 --> 09:33.200
You're supposed to give all of it, you're not supposed to keep any of it for yourself.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.200
That is it.

09:34.200 --> 09:41.440
Where's all these conservative Republican Christians at today that are owning businesses

09:41.440 --> 09:46.080
and you think they would ever, that's not the way, like what happened to that?

09:46.080 --> 09:48.680
The idea that you can't have any private property.

09:48.680 --> 09:49.680
That's gone now.

09:49.680 --> 09:50.880
That's not the Christians today.

09:50.880 --> 09:53.960
This is a whole different world back then.

09:53.960 --> 09:54.960
Yeah.

09:54.960 --> 10:03.040
According to our modern evangelical fairytale, it's our blessing by God who has given us

10:03.040 --> 10:09.240
manifest destiny to be able to make as much capital as we possibly can.

10:09.240 --> 10:15.880
But in antiquity, those Christians were instructed, you have to get rid of everything.

10:15.880 --> 10:20.040
And what they said was you got to lay it at the feet of the rock.

10:20.040 --> 10:24.080
You got to lay everything at the feet of the rock.

10:24.080 --> 10:25.080
And so that's what they did.

10:25.080 --> 10:30.240
And then it says they redistributed out what they needed for food and whatnot like that.

10:30.240 --> 10:31.240
So yeah.

10:31.240 --> 10:32.240
Right.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.240
Remember, these people are dropping out though.

10:33.240 --> 10:35.440
They're dropping out of society, right?

10:35.440 --> 10:36.440
They're disappearing.

10:36.440 --> 10:38.200
They're leaving families.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.200
They're doing all this.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.720
So we got kind of a radical group.

10:41.720 --> 10:50.960
And when we see gangster Peter, right, making these hits and setting the stage for the

10:50.960 --> 11:00.080
rock, Petros, yeah, that's his gang name, you know, he's got some friends.

11:00.080 --> 11:03.520
They call them the sons of thunder.

11:03.520 --> 11:06.000
Don't mess with these people.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.240
We know that they're armed.

11:08.240 --> 11:15.000
Where Peter's the one who jumps out and starts swinging the sword, right, cuts his ear off.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Yeah.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.240
He's not supposed to be carrying a sword, by the way.

11:18.240 --> 11:19.240
That's a no-no.

11:19.240 --> 11:20.240
Right.

11:20.240 --> 11:26.000
And there's no, you know, Ray in antiquity, they have laws against things, right?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.480
So yeah, he's armed and he's there.

11:28.480 --> 11:32.440
And he's there with the trafficking Jesus, with the boy and the naked boy.

11:32.440 --> 11:36.600
But let's go to the, let's go to the next one.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.600
Yeah.

11:37.720 --> 11:39.280
All curses, right?

11:39.280 --> 11:40.960
There won't be any curses anymore.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.760
This is from Apocalypse.

11:42.760 --> 11:43.760
Yeah.

11:43.760 --> 11:48.600
And the throne of God, the lamb was in them, right, will be in them.

11:48.600 --> 11:52.720
And the slaves, right, they'll serve them, right?

11:52.720 --> 12:00.880
And they will look upon his face and they're, they're, they're foreheads, metopon, right

12:00.880 --> 12:02.040
on their foreheads.

12:02.040 --> 12:07.480
They're going to have to on them out to, they're going to have his name.

12:07.480 --> 12:20.920
This thug leader has slaves and those slaves bear a brand as do any slaves, right?

12:20.920 --> 12:25.120
This is, you know, we're not living in a slave culture, so this doesn't strike us.

12:25.120 --> 12:30.040
But these are, that word Latreo is that word of service.

12:30.040 --> 12:36.360
Jesus has slaves whom he imprints with his own name on their heads, right?

12:36.360 --> 12:40.240
Now remember, we looked at Jesus as the laystace.

12:40.240 --> 12:44.000
He calls himself, when he gets arrested, he comes out yelling, he's like, would you come

12:44.000 --> 12:48.040
out against me armed like I'm a pirate, right?

12:48.040 --> 12:53.520
This is the accoutrement of the pirate, right?

12:53.520 --> 12:57.680
This is, he's got a brand that he carries, right?

12:57.680 --> 13:02.800
And he brands you, you're his, right, and he's going to trade you off.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.160
That brand will follow you.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.560
You'll always be in service, bro.

13:06.560 --> 13:09.240
So this is a part of the machinery of antiquity.

13:09.240 --> 13:13.320
People don't realize it's baked into the language, you know what I mean?

13:13.320 --> 13:14.720
Oh, that's crazy.

13:14.720 --> 13:17.200
That is wild, actually.

13:17.200 --> 13:25.160
That is just absolutely, I mean, he's, this is like, you're, you're getting branded.

13:25.160 --> 13:29.680
You're getting, basically getting tatted basically for your gang.

13:29.680 --> 13:34.000
And now you better die, you better be a martyr for this gang.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
It's, it's radical.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.280
This is not like some club that everybody was holding hands and doing hymns like your,

13:39.280 --> 13:40.720
like your Sunday church.

13:40.720 --> 13:44.760
This is like, you're going to get a brand on you and then you better go and die for

13:44.760 --> 13:45.760
this faith.

13:45.760 --> 13:46.760
Because if you don't, you're not real.

13:46.760 --> 13:47.760
Yeah.

13:47.760 --> 13:53.520
You better be a, this is like the real, I don't know, I was going to say the word jihadi,

13:53.520 --> 13:59.040
but like, kind of, did you notice, did you notice the apocalypse?

13:59.040 --> 14:03.800
He's constantly threatening, I'll, I'll wipe your name out of the book of life.

14:03.800 --> 14:07.440
If you do this, I'll wipe your name out of the book of life.

14:07.440 --> 14:08.440
They're not playing around.

14:08.440 --> 14:09.760
This is not a light at all.

14:09.760 --> 14:10.760
This is serious.

14:10.760 --> 14:11.760
Yeah.

14:11.760 --> 14:12.760
Yeah.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.120
And why is he coming back?

14:14.120 --> 14:19.600
People are like, Jesus, come back and resurrect me and the evangelicals are like, Oh, I'm a

14:19.600 --> 14:23.840
dominionist, pre tribulations, right?

14:23.840 --> 14:27.920
Just BS that has no, that has no meaning to it.

14:28.280 --> 14:33.360
From the 1600s that they just made up, it's not, it's not biblical.

14:33.360 --> 14:39.000
Like, like, like Bart Ehrman pointed out in one of Derek's videos that Jesus is coming

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
back.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.320
He's going to look for people when he says Jezebel, he's talking about people, a specific

14:44.320 --> 14:50.680
type of people who are profaners of the mysteries, people who are part, he's going to take them,

14:50.680 --> 14:56.160
throw her out of bed, rape her, go look for her children and kill them.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.200
Well, that's, that's, that's the return of Jesus.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.200
There's no rapture.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.880
There's no come to take my people who believe me.

15:01.880 --> 15:04.120
No, it's come to kill the people who don't believe me.

15:04.120 --> 15:06.080
It's the, it's the negative.

15:06.080 --> 15:08.080
It's the opposite of that.

15:08.080 --> 15:10.200
That's a thug hit right there, baby.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.200
Kill that.

15:11.200 --> 15:13.480
Not only that, kill that, kill that BI.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.480
You know what?

15:14.480 --> 15:18.680
And her children to knock them all off, knock them all off.

15:18.680 --> 15:19.680
It's a hit.

15:19.680 --> 15:25.720
But that's, that's, that's, that's your, that's your basic messiah, messianic, all messiahs

15:25.760 --> 15:30.280
doesn't matter what sect or religion, that's the, the idea of the messiah.

15:30.280 --> 15:32.200
That's what the messiah is supposed to do.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.200
Yeah.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.280
That's not, that's not nothing new that Christianity is bringing to the table.

15:36.280 --> 15:37.480
That's just, that's the messiah.

15:37.480 --> 15:38.840
That's the real messiah.

15:38.840 --> 15:42.640
There is nothing new that Christianity brought to the table.

15:42.640 --> 15:43.640
Yeah.

15:43.640 --> 15:46.040
There is nothing new, right?

15:46.040 --> 15:51.600
If you took a pin and marked out like you were redacting something for a lawyer or something.

15:51.600 --> 15:57.000
If you went, took a pin, black pin and marked out everything that had precedent, the whole

15:57.000 --> 16:01.120
thing would be dark, you know, except for Jesus went down to Bethany.

16:01.120 --> 16:04.360
That's the only thing that, you know, just be his directions.

16:04.360 --> 16:05.360
Right.

16:05.360 --> 16:06.360
Right.

16:06.360 --> 16:07.360
Yeah.

16:07.360 --> 16:08.360
Love it.

16:08.360 --> 16:09.360
Love it.

16:09.360 --> 16:12.600
It's everything is, but you can't, you and I can't do anything original, right?

16:12.600 --> 16:17.400
You don't, you see anybody else coming up with a religion that's new thing like that?

16:17.400 --> 16:18.400
No.

16:18.400 --> 16:23.280
You see with language, when you talk, when you're using a certain language, you cannot

16:23.280 --> 16:28.800
come out of, you can't separate yourself from the linguistics that you're operating within.

16:28.800 --> 16:32.720
No, it's like an amber and it traps you.

16:32.720 --> 16:37.760
That language traps the meaning for, forever preserves it.

16:37.760 --> 16:38.760
Yeah.

16:38.760 --> 16:39.760
He's going to come back.

16:39.760 --> 16:43.760
He's not, people think he's coming back and it's all going to be half resurrection and

16:43.760 --> 16:44.760
I'm going to heaven.

16:44.760 --> 16:45.760
You all can.

16:45.760 --> 16:46.760
No, no, no.

16:46.760 --> 16:50.480
He's going to come back to kill all of us.

16:50.480 --> 16:53.520
The mission is to kill everyone.

16:53.520 --> 16:55.160
Think about this.

16:55.160 --> 16:58.520
Think about, let's look at some more sources.

16:58.520 --> 16:59.680
What's that next one?

16:59.680 --> 17:00.680
Yeah.

17:00.680 --> 17:01.680
Don't do that.

17:01.680 --> 17:05.960
Oh, I just wanted to bring this up because this is a quote, you know, revelation 22.

17:05.960 --> 17:08.000
I am a fellow servant with you.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Right.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.480
That word servant is the same word for slave, right?

17:12.480 --> 17:13.480
Right.

17:13.480 --> 17:14.480
Yeah.

17:14.480 --> 17:15.480
No, no, no.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.280
He's talking about bowing.

17:17.280 --> 17:20.760
This is an angel responding to John who's bowing in front of him.

17:20.760 --> 17:21.920
He says, don't do that.

17:21.920 --> 17:27.280
He's like, you know, I'm a, I'm a, I'm also a slave, right?

17:27.280 --> 17:29.200
And then he says worship God.

17:29.200 --> 17:34.200
The only one that you're that slave to is the living God.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.120
We are do Lloyd.

17:36.120 --> 17:38.320
We are slaves, brah.

17:38.320 --> 17:39.320
Yeah.

17:39.320 --> 17:40.320
Okay.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.320
Next one that.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.320
Oh, look at this one.

17:43.320 --> 17:44.320
Oh.

17:45.160 --> 17:52.000
And by the way, isn't that, isn't there, isn't, isn't he basically calling him like the equivalent

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
of the B word, right?

17:54.000 --> 17:58.320
Uh, he's, well, uh, that's an interesting question.

17:58.320 --> 17:59.560
That's an interesting question.

17:59.560 --> 18:10.880
I don't, uh, it's so cult tied up this word, that you even have dogs who are official priests.

18:10.880 --> 18:15.000
So the, because the next one is father McCoy, right?

18:15.000 --> 18:17.360
Those are people who are specific.

18:17.360 --> 18:18.760
That's a technical term.

18:18.760 --> 18:19.760
Yeah.

18:19.760 --> 18:27.680
Those are people within the cult or within the community who are experts in drugs, right?

18:27.680 --> 18:30.160
And, and so all of these are the pornoi.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.520
Who do you think the pornoi are?

18:32.520 --> 18:36.160
Those are the people that's the lady Babylon way, right?

18:36.160 --> 18:40.840
And, and why do you think they're called phonase?

18:40.840 --> 18:46.280
They're called murderers because they're performing their sacrifice.

18:46.280 --> 18:53.200
And the last one, the a dola la trii, those who were in service of the image, the image

18:53.200 --> 18:55.520
of the image, right?

18:55.520 --> 19:00.920
These, these people are the people on the outside that, and what's going to happen to

19:00.920 --> 19:01.920
them, right?

19:01.920 --> 19:03.960
Let's see what the next one is.

19:03.960 --> 19:04.960
Yeah.

19:04.960 --> 19:05.960
Yeah.

19:05.960 --> 19:06.960
Yeah.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.240
And she'll take away the words of the book of the prophets.

19:09.240 --> 19:15.560
God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from

19:15.560 --> 19:18.080
the things which are written in this book.

19:18.080 --> 19:19.080
Yeah.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.200
This is intense, man.

19:21.200 --> 19:24.320
This is not the love your neighbor type of Jesus right here.

19:24.320 --> 19:28.360
This is, he's going to wipe you off the face of the planet like you never existed, throw

19:28.360 --> 19:30.640
you in the lake of fire.

19:30.640 --> 19:31.800
That's what this is.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.680
And when you say wipe off, you're right.

19:33.680 --> 19:37.480
That's exactly off the LA is exactly that, right?

19:37.480 --> 19:41.880
He's going to take out your portion, right from the tree of life.

19:41.880 --> 19:45.880
You're not going to have any sort of access to this, right?

19:45.880 --> 19:46.880
That's it, bro.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.560
I'm going to kill you dead.

19:48.560 --> 19:50.000
Is this a threat, Neil?

19:50.000 --> 19:54.560
When you said gangster Jesus, and I was like, this is perfect.

19:54.560 --> 20:00.560
This was Neil's idea by the way, I said, this is perfect gangster all over the place.

20:00.560 --> 20:01.560
This is an example.

20:01.560 --> 20:07.200
He's got a book and if you're not in it, right, you don't get anywhere.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.800
You don't get anywhere without me in my book.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.120
That's a gangster, bro.

20:11.120 --> 20:12.120
Yeah.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.120
It's gorgeous.

20:13.120 --> 20:14.120
Yeah.

20:14.120 --> 20:15.120
Yeah.

20:15.120 --> 20:20.920
And it's like, there's no, this isn't about like doing anything or feeding the poor or

20:20.920 --> 20:21.920
doing.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.920
It's just about getting in line and do what I say.

20:24.920 --> 20:30.640
That's the only thing that makes you or breaks you in the eyes of this God.

20:30.640 --> 20:32.600
Do get in line, period.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.440
I don't care what's, there's no objective morality.

20:35.440 --> 20:39.680
Like you hear these Christians talk about today and no, no, no, no, no, no, it's get

20:39.680 --> 20:44.080
in line, do as you're told or die.

20:44.080 --> 20:51.000
It's when you think about it, it's really simple and it's kind of it's really dark because

20:51.000 --> 20:56.120
that's what this whole faith is kind of based on is just following it.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.120
You know what I mean?

20:57.120 --> 21:03.400
It's not like, like, I hate to say like paganism is like this like huge umbrella term, but

21:03.400 --> 21:07.240
like these other rights, then they don't operate that way.

21:07.240 --> 21:10.560
There is no like, you better do this or else.

21:10.560 --> 21:15.560
It's only within this biblical religion that you get that.

21:15.560 --> 21:24.840
And it's so opposite of classical civilization, the drive towards investigation and study

21:24.840 --> 21:31.560
and argumentation, you know, it's so contrary to that.

21:31.560 --> 21:35.800
There isn't, there is an implied reason in pagan religion.

21:35.800 --> 21:39.840
It's like when somebody tells you, don't believe what you're seeing, right?

21:39.840 --> 21:44.640
Don't, don't, it's just bad press that's giving you this impression.

21:44.640 --> 21:46.200
That's what Christianity does.

21:46.200 --> 21:48.240
It says, don't use your reason.

21:48.240 --> 21:54.760
Well, you know, you don't, I noticed about that too, multi polytheism, right?

21:54.760 --> 22:00.640
Multiple gods, you give your devote devotion to the God that you align with, the God that

22:00.640 --> 22:03.840
you look at, that you look up to, that you need help from.

22:03.840 --> 22:11.360
But in monotheism, it's sort of, monotheism sort of aligns the world in a way that makes

22:11.360 --> 22:16.360
it so that you have one king or one Caesar or one emperor.

22:16.360 --> 22:21.760
And underneath that one emperor is the footstool, the world, the Roman empire, and everyone

22:21.760 --> 22:24.400
is a servant to this one emperor.

22:24.400 --> 22:29.680
That's why all of a sudden when you get this Christian Byzantine empire, it's, it's really

22:29.720 --> 22:34.920
just like, all of it's privately owned by the Caesar, by, by the emperor, by the Constantine

22:34.920 --> 22:39.160
or whoever, like, you know, all these different Constantine the six and Constantine the seventh

22:39.160 --> 22:46.480
and, and just keeps going until another, and like, you can come get it from me, come get

22:46.480 --> 22:47.480
it from me.

22:47.480 --> 22:52.520
Like if you can assert this throne, you can have this world, but until then it's mine.

22:52.520 --> 22:57.440
And these legions are mine, they're going to do what I say, and my will is be done.

22:57.440 --> 23:04.440
And it, it follows the monotheistic religion that it's operating within.

23:05.560 --> 23:13.360
So the religion sort of sets the tone of how the society operates, whatever theocracy,

23:13.360 --> 23:18.720
like in the, and like, I, you know, I sound like I'm people, people will always say, but

23:18.720 --> 23:21.160
you act like the pagan world is so perfect.

23:21.160 --> 23:25.880
There were still problems, of course there was, but like, at least within this world

23:25.920 --> 23:30.520
where you have all these different deities and different temples and, you know, the

23:30.520 --> 23:35.800
temple of Ephesus was Artemis, the temple of Athena, the Acropolis, at least in this

23:35.800 --> 23:42.360
world, it seems to be, there's, there was more, like you said, there's more debates,

23:42.360 --> 23:48.360
more discussion, more, more diverse, like more, more metropolitan-y feeling going on.

23:49.360 --> 23:50.640
You know, what is your thoughts on that?

23:50.640 --> 23:51.640
And I could be wrong.

23:51.960 --> 23:56.520
I think what you're describing is not the gang, right?

23:56.520 --> 24:00.200
The gang, we have to have a certain code and we have to have a certain color and we have

24:00.200 --> 24:07.200
to have a certain ethnicity and we take orders up and we don't question, we just kill, right?

24:07.200 --> 24:09.040
That's the gang mentality.

24:09.040 --> 24:13.320
And I think Christianity is very much, that's because when you, when you said it, gangster

24:13.320 --> 24:16.520
Jesus, I thought, wow, Neil, you've captured it.

24:16.520 --> 24:17.360
It is.

24:17.400 --> 24:22.520
When you have paganism, on the other hand, there is no overriding authority.

24:22.880 --> 24:27.240
There's no one central person who can tell you what's what.

24:27.720 --> 24:27.880
Yeah.

24:27.880 --> 24:28.800
I mean, think about it.

24:28.880 --> 24:31.640
Paganism expressed itself in the chorus.

24:32.080 --> 24:36.280
A chorus is a group of people who come together and sing and dance.

24:36.880 --> 24:40.800
I mean, what is more, you know, what is more democratic than that?

24:40.800 --> 24:41.760
The Christians did not.

24:42.040 --> 24:46.280
And even Zeus, even Zeus doesn't have all the power.

24:46.520 --> 24:52.720
Like Zeus might, might get, Eros might have power over Zeus or Athena might have power.

24:52.720 --> 24:56.640
There's, there's different situations where sometimes Zeus doesn't have the

24:56.640 --> 24:58.520
authority just to do whatever he wants.

24:58.840 --> 24:59.040
Yeah.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.960
So there is that, there's that.

25:01.560 --> 25:09.840
I feel like that, that aspect kind of dictates the culture in a, in a really

25:09.840 --> 25:15.040
effective way when you have that one authority on top, everyone follows suit.

25:15.440 --> 25:17.960
Better do what that one authority says or else.

25:18.920 --> 25:19.160
Yeah.

25:19.680 --> 25:23.920
And it's funny because when the, when the Ottomans come and take

25:23.920 --> 25:27.920
Constance and Opal, Mehmed II, what does he do?

25:28.200 --> 25:29.400
He says, I'm Caesar now.

25:29.920 --> 25:31.960
He just wants, he wants to continue playing the same game.

25:32.160 --> 25:33.440
He's not changing anything up.

25:33.840 --> 25:37.280
He just, we're Muslim now, but, but I'm going to be Caesar.

25:37.520 --> 25:40.000
Even, even ask the Pope, call me Caesar.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.320
Pope, the Pope's like, no, bro.

25:41.760 --> 25:45.800
But like, well, you still, he's, they're, they're playing the same game.

25:46.200 --> 25:46.480
Yeah.

25:47.040 --> 25:50.200
And it's kind of, it's kind of crazy to think about the world.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.640
Like that's how the world was for a long time.

25:53.160 --> 25:57.040
What's the difference between a crusade and a gang war?

25:57.360 --> 26:02.400
You know, it's always over, it's always over capital of some support, some, you

26:02.400 --> 26:09.920
know, uh, some kind of rights to be able to run this black market in this area.

26:10.320 --> 26:11.000
You know what I mean?

26:11.000 --> 26:14.840
It's always just like, look at the, look at the history of the crusades.

26:14.880 --> 26:16.440
It's the same thing.

26:16.760 --> 26:17.680
It's the flow.

26:17.680 --> 26:19.080
There is no ideal.

26:19.080 --> 26:23.880
People that think crusaders were ideal, idealistic, um, you know,

26:23.880 --> 26:25.640
I'm going to go fight for Jesus.

26:25.640 --> 26:29.640
And there are people who have that soldier of Christ mentality today.

26:29.920 --> 26:30.800
Let me tell you something.

26:30.800 --> 26:32.680
There's no such thing as a crusade.

26:32.680 --> 26:36.880
Crusades are just wars over turf and cash.

26:36.960 --> 26:37.200
Right.

26:37.560 --> 26:38.960
That's, that's all they are.

26:39.480 --> 26:44.160
So I don't, I don't, I don't understand why, um, people can't see the

26:44.160 --> 26:46.880
thuggery that's behind Christianity.

26:46.960 --> 26:50.240
That's why Neil, I'm still really impressed that you made.

26:50.440 --> 26:53.960
Well, the, the Godfather, what do you think a Pope is?

26:54.760 --> 26:56.240
He's the, he's the Godfather.

26:57.440 --> 27:01.200
This is, I mean, it's like literally the same thing.

27:01.760 --> 27:02.040
Yeah.

27:02.240 --> 27:03.320
You know, what's the difference?

27:03.480 --> 27:05.240
You know, it's my ring, man.

27:05.400 --> 27:05.720
Yeah.

27:06.240 --> 27:06.760
On your knee.

27:08.520 --> 27:09.280
Do what you told.

27:09.880 --> 27:10.600
Lovely.

27:10.840 --> 27:12.120
Let's go to the next source.

27:12.120 --> 27:13.880
Let me see if I got any more cool gang.

27:14.200 --> 27:14.480
All right.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.360
So we have angels or slaves.

27:16.360 --> 27:16.800
We got that.

27:16.800 --> 27:17.560
We did that one, right?

27:18.120 --> 27:18.480
Yeah.

27:19.160 --> 27:19.480
Good.

27:20.120 --> 27:20.560
Here we go.

27:21.120 --> 27:21.640
Yeah.

27:21.760 --> 27:22.240
Yeah.

27:23.240 --> 27:24.080
That's the next one.

27:24.080 --> 27:24.920
Let's go to the next one.

27:24.920 --> 27:25.160
Yeah.

27:26.880 --> 27:27.440
Yeah.

27:27.480 --> 27:27.960
Yeah.

27:28.000 --> 27:28.320
Okay.

27:28.320 --> 27:28.720
Yeah.

27:28.760 --> 27:29.120
Okay.

27:29.120 --> 27:32.400
So for all of these people, look, it gives off a list, right?

27:32.400 --> 27:36.040
Of people and notice right at the top, it's apistos.

27:36.320 --> 27:41.280
These are people who don't subscribe to your notion of faith, right?

27:41.320 --> 27:44.760
These are the people who don't just subscribe to your notion of faith.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.400
So that's anybody.

27:46.920 --> 27:51.000
We're not just talking about people think this is a list of bad things to do,

27:51.000 --> 27:52.640
like murder, right?

27:52.640 --> 27:54.840
Murder and, and lying.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.160
These are bad things.

27:56.160 --> 27:58.000
So Jesus is the good guy.

27:58.000 --> 27:58.880
He doesn't follow it.

27:58.920 --> 27:59.520
No, no, no.

27:59.920 --> 28:06.120
He's saying anybody that doesn't follow us is abominable.

28:06.600 --> 28:07.160
Yeah.

28:07.160 --> 28:08.880
They're murderers, right?

28:09.040 --> 28:11.680
They're, they're pharmacists.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.480
Look, they're drug experts.

28:13.520 --> 28:15.360
They're drug users.

28:15.960 --> 28:18.320
They are wizard sorcerers.

28:18.720 --> 28:21.600
He's calling everybody that, right?

28:21.600 --> 28:23.400
And saying they're idolaters.

28:23.400 --> 28:26.440
They're those image casters, right?

28:26.440 --> 28:30.640
And by the way, he says the liars got no part.

28:31.480 --> 28:31.800
Yeah.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.480
The liars got no part.

28:34.200 --> 28:34.880
Yeah.

28:35.520 --> 28:35.720
Yeah.

28:35.720 --> 28:37.120
They're going to be put in a lake.

28:37.240 --> 28:41.440
Think of that imagery, though, a lake, which you burn it with fire and brimstone.

28:41.680 --> 28:42.200
Yeah.

28:43.200 --> 28:46.200
Now that sounds like that sounds like the pit of Tartarus, doesn't it?

28:46.880 --> 28:47.320
Yeah.

28:47.320 --> 28:49.440
No, this is the purging, right?

28:49.440 --> 28:54.280
That Phaeoi, that, that brimstone that you're talking about.

28:54.800 --> 28:58.240
Yeah, that's a powerful purgative.

28:58.720 --> 28:59.240
Yeah.

28:59.240 --> 29:00.760
And they're going to burn with it.

29:00.760 --> 29:04.160
They're going to be purified in hell, right?

29:04.200 --> 29:06.000
And that's the second death.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.560
That's what you call the second death.

29:07.840 --> 29:10.200
This is what Jesus brings.

29:11.000 --> 29:17.480
This promise that if he comes back and you're not one of the faithful, right?

29:17.560 --> 29:19.120
This is what you get.

29:19.120 --> 29:24.240
So right away you got, um, look, there's no loving.

29:24.240 --> 29:27.000
Here, where'd the loving go, right?

29:27.000 --> 29:32.120
And evangelicals have such a good way of pulling that, of excusing this, right?

29:32.120 --> 29:33.560
Of pulling this out of the hat.

29:34.040 --> 29:37.240
They say, Oh, well, just the age of grace is over.

29:37.240 --> 29:41.160
I'm a dominionist and the age of grace is over.

29:41.640 --> 29:45.280
And, and that's why all of a sudden, no, no, no, let's just tell me what you've got.

29:45.280 --> 29:51.880
You've got a picture of Jesus slaughtering all of humanity, all of humanity.

29:52.160 --> 29:53.440
You know, I thought about this.

29:54.600 --> 29:55.480
I thought about this.

29:55.480 --> 30:00.800
And then even if Christian turned out to be true, which it's not, but let's just,

30:00.800 --> 30:02.000
let's play along with this.

30:02.000 --> 30:08.480
Even if this, this scenario actually comes about, I'm going, I'm saying sending

30:08.480 --> 30:09.360
in that lake of fire.

30:09.360 --> 30:14.200
I don't, this, this unit, this, this reality that you created, you're evil.

30:14.240 --> 30:18.560
I'm not going to spend eternity at your feet worshiping you for this.

30:18.720 --> 30:19.080
Yeah.

30:19.200 --> 30:20.000
Kill me now.

30:20.080 --> 30:21.080
And I'm done.

30:21.080 --> 30:26.560
I, I'm out of this game because this is just, and it's like, you created me this

30:26.560 --> 30:26.840
way.

30:26.840 --> 30:28.600
So I don't know what your deal is.

30:28.640 --> 30:31.520
You're the one that needs, this is, this is a you problem.

30:31.560 --> 30:32.160
Get rid of me.

30:32.160 --> 30:32.600
I'm done.

30:32.600 --> 30:33.080
I don't care.

30:33.080 --> 30:37.240
I'm like, that's to me is just evil.

30:38.160 --> 30:42.320
I'm hoping, I'm hoping Neil that it's real as it can be.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.760
So I can stand right in front of them.

30:45.560 --> 30:50.800
And when it comes my moment of judgment, creamer, and they talk about the great

30:50.800 --> 30:55.440
white throne and his judgment, I'm looking forward to standing right there.

30:55.440 --> 31:01.480
I feel the same way for the great white throne and saying, you were arrested

31:01.480 --> 31:03.320
with a naked boy.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.200
I'm not following.

31:07.720 --> 31:09.600
I wish I was behind you to watch it too.

31:10.600 --> 31:11.640
I hope I don't go in front of you.

31:11.640 --> 31:13.120
So I don't get to, I don't miss it.

31:13.640 --> 31:14.080
Yeah.

31:14.440 --> 31:14.920
Yeah.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.280
Let's see what else is going to happen to us.

31:17.320 --> 31:18.600
Because the next quote.

31:18.840 --> 31:20.360
Fire from Urino's.

31:20.640 --> 31:21.240
Yeah.

31:21.920 --> 31:25.440
And she'll go out to see the nations, which are in the, oh, in the four quarters

31:25.440 --> 31:28.960
of the earth, Gog and Magog to gather them together to battle.

31:29.240 --> 31:31.160
The number of whom is as the same as the sea.

31:31.160 --> 31:35.440
And they went up on the breadth of the earth and compass the camp of the saints

31:35.440 --> 31:36.880
about these are the bad guys, right?

31:36.880 --> 31:38.000
That's, that's us.

31:38.320 --> 31:41.760
It's everybody who's not faithful and the beloved city.

31:42.280 --> 31:46.520
And they came from and fire from came down from God out of heaven.

31:46.520 --> 31:51.440
This is that poor Urino's and notice it's got the Gog and Magog reference in

31:51.440 --> 31:55.280
it, which all the evangelicals are going to be standing up saying, oh my God,

31:55.280 --> 31:58.520
he's talking about Gog and Magog, right?

31:58.840 --> 32:02.320
Gog, if you go back to Ezekiel, which I've gotten the bottom.

32:05.200 --> 32:07.160
And you're going to say, wait a minute, you're not reading the Hebrew.

32:07.480 --> 32:08.120
Yeah, you're right.

32:08.120 --> 32:10.120
I'm reading the oldest version we have.

32:17.120 --> 32:21.720
And you, son of man, son of man.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.160
Now you know where he stole the title from, right?

32:24.200 --> 32:24.640
Right.

32:24.640 --> 32:25.320
That's from Ezekiel.

32:25.360 --> 32:25.640
Yep.

32:25.760 --> 32:26.080
Yeah.

32:26.400 --> 32:32.320
Prophecy against Gog and say the Lord says these things.

32:32.440 --> 32:33.440
He do look.

32:33.720 --> 32:35.600
I am Episay.

32:35.640 --> 32:37.360
I am against you.

32:37.400 --> 32:42.440
Gog, the ruler of Ross, Ross.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.200
And what is Ross?

32:44.280 --> 32:48.960
Ross is later, uh, Ruth's on the Latin side.

32:49.200 --> 32:55.040
These are the people who live, um, where we now talk about Russians.

32:55.520 --> 32:56.000
Oh, yeah.

32:56.000 --> 33:02.160
So, so when the Christian evangelicals get all, especially the, the dominionists

33:02.440 --> 33:05.280
and those guys, and it's mostly guys because they hate women.

33:05.280 --> 33:06.200
They're misogynists.

33:06.600 --> 33:12.360
Um, it's built in, it's built into the DNA of the gang of Christianity.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.680
Um, and they just happen to bring it out.

33:14.680 --> 33:18.360
Those guys just happened to bring this before Doug Wilson is in that group.

33:18.920 --> 33:24.680
Anyway, anyway, um, they bring out this, uh, uh, hatred.

33:24.720 --> 33:29.960
It's a, it's a living hatred, but they say also, Oh, this, the Russians, right?

33:29.960 --> 33:33.120
You notice the Christians are all excited about the Russians and they're like,

33:33.120 --> 33:34.440
Hey, don't help Ukraine.

33:35.040 --> 33:35.280
Right.

33:35.280 --> 33:41.680
You know, I know, I know Christians on Twitter, Catholics and Baptist, both of them.

33:42.080 --> 33:45.080
And they, and those people hate each other, but they, they're coming together

33:45.080 --> 33:50.200
and backing up Russia because Putin, cause they all, they all understand something.

33:50.680 --> 33:53.080
They all understand something that's really real.

33:53.800 --> 33:58.480
That the Orthodox church of Russia has a better claim to the, to the, to the

33:58.480 --> 34:01.880
Greek Orthodox church than, than the Catholic church does.

34:02.160 --> 34:06.920
They have a better claim to Peter and Paul than, than Rome does right now.

34:07.600 --> 34:09.440
That's the Orthodox church of Russia right now.

34:09.440 --> 34:16.160
That's the original church that fled Constantinople in 1453 and a century

34:16.160 --> 34:23.600
later, Ivan the terrible, his grandmother was the niece of the last Roman emperor.

34:24.480 --> 34:28.880
Who flew, who died during the siege of Constantinople.

34:30.040 --> 34:32.000
So you have a direct lineage.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.440
That's why he called up the czar.

34:33.640 --> 34:36.000
He's the first czar of Russia.

34:36.280 --> 34:36.640
Yeah.

34:36.800 --> 34:37.600
The Kaiser.

34:37.600 --> 34:38.520
He's making us up.

34:38.520 --> 34:42.840
He was, he was saying, I'm, I'm legitimately tracing myself back to the

34:42.840 --> 34:43.920
Constantine dynasty.

34:44.760 --> 34:45.400
Oh man.

34:45.400 --> 34:47.000
That's so arouses me.

34:47.040 --> 34:48.480
That's so arouses me.

34:48.880 --> 34:52.840
Uh, so tell me a little, tell me a little bit more about these people.

34:52.840 --> 34:56.960
So they tell you, they're like, Hey, in support of the roost.

34:57.360 --> 35:00.240
Did, um, did you know what side you're on?

35:00.240 --> 35:01.480
That's why I like this.

35:01.480 --> 35:07.320
That's why I, I understand why these Christians, these Twitter Catholics are

35:07.360 --> 35:09.040
like, Putin did nothing wrong.

35:09.320 --> 35:10.480
I get why they're like that.

35:10.520 --> 35:11.200
You're, you're right.

35:11.200 --> 35:11.760
You're damn right.

35:11.760 --> 35:12.480
You're on that side.

35:12.480 --> 35:13.640
You should be on that side.

35:14.000 --> 35:14.720
Let's get real.

35:14.720 --> 35:16.320
You're, that's the side you're supposed to be on.

35:16.800 --> 35:17.080
Yeah.

35:17.160 --> 35:20.960
I'm supposed to be on the other side, the side of democracy, the side of Athena.

35:21.720 --> 35:22.040
Yeah.

35:22.560 --> 35:26.040
My own family wants everybody to die.

35:26.040 --> 35:26.560
Right.

35:26.560 --> 35:32.840
I mean, we all have family like this who are evangelicals or steeped in the

35:32.880 --> 35:36.840
conservative fundamentalist Christianity or somehow influenced by it.

35:37.240 --> 35:44.160
They want Vlad to sweep down and surround Israel because that's when Jesus is

35:44.160 --> 35:47.280
coming back and according to them, right?

35:47.320 --> 35:52.680
According to their bull, their BS, um, can't read the original text approach.

35:52.720 --> 35:53.160
Right.

35:54.280 --> 35:59.240
And, and they, that's why, you know, the Christians actually say now, people should

35:59.240 --> 36:01.520
know this, this is a public service I'm doing.

36:02.000 --> 36:02.240
Right.

36:02.240 --> 36:07.400
People, people should know that the Christians are saying that there is no

36:07.400 --> 36:11.720
America in the book of revelation.

36:12.240 --> 36:12.800
Right.

36:12.880 --> 36:13.960
There's no America.

36:14.160 --> 36:22.080
So America must really fall before Vlad can sweep down and surround Israel.

36:22.080 --> 36:26.480
Cause when he does that, the bear, when the bear does that, the text calls him,

36:26.840 --> 36:32.200
then Jesus can crack, come in the world and boom, murder and mayhem can

36:32.200 --> 36:37.680
take, take off like a, and they're going to push to get those things done so that

36:37.680 --> 36:40.560
they can legitimately say, it's my religion.

36:40.560 --> 36:41.320
I got to follow it.

36:41.680 --> 36:43.280
I got to do as it's my religion.

36:43.720 --> 36:47.480
And so, and that's why you get this push against degeneracy.

36:48.080 --> 36:53.400
So they call it putans, putan cleaning up the degenerates, those degenerates, you

36:53.400 --> 36:58.200
know, all those, all those, uh, those degenerate, uh, atheists and, and all

36:58.200 --> 37:03.240
those, uh, you know, all those gays and all those LGBTQ degenerate.

37:03.240 --> 37:09.000
That's what that, that this is what this is, this is their, this is the way they

37:09.000 --> 37:09.720
see the world.

37:10.120 --> 37:10.360
Yeah.

37:10.360 --> 37:16.520
And so putan as out to them is on the, on the side of, of God in there to them.

37:17.120 --> 37:21.440
Well, we know, we know it's, it's, he's, he's evil.

37:21.480 --> 37:22.040
We know that.

37:22.400 --> 37:27.120
You gotta know by the fact that he blows people up randomly with rockets, you

37:27.120 --> 37:29.560
know, like mothers and children.

37:29.600 --> 37:31.440
I mean, this is what I don't get.

37:31.760 --> 37:36.360
You know, Jesus says directly, I'm going to take all those liars and I'm going

37:36.360 --> 37:37.600
to feed them to the birds.

37:37.640 --> 37:39.480
He's such a good gangster leader.

37:39.520 --> 37:39.920
You know what I mean?

37:39.920 --> 37:41.520
He's such a good mob boss.

37:41.920 --> 37:48.160
He's like, Peter, Peter, take those people and feed them to the birds.

37:48.520 --> 37:48.960
Right.

37:48.960 --> 37:52.120
We, I mean, there's, there's nothing better than this.

37:52.440 --> 37:52.760
What?

37:54.200 --> 37:54.680
Yeah.

37:54.960 --> 37:56.360
Yeah.

37:56.360 --> 38:02.040
And I saw an angel right standing in the sun and he shouted in a great voice

38:02.040 --> 38:07.040
saying, um, to all the birds flying around in midair.

38:07.320 --> 38:08.720
He says, come now soon.

38:09.560 --> 38:15.000
Assemble at the banquet, the great banquet of God.

38:15.440 --> 38:16.200
And it goes on.

38:17.040 --> 38:21.880
The text goes on to talk about feeding us to these birds.

38:22.640 --> 38:23.160
Yeah.

38:23.200 --> 38:24.880
Feeding us to these birds.

38:24.920 --> 38:26.640
That's where we're going.

38:27.080 --> 38:32.320
So it doesn't, it, it only makes sense that modern evangelicals can say, um,

38:32.320 --> 38:33.920
what Putin is doing is good.

38:33.920 --> 38:35.320
We can excuse lies.

38:35.320 --> 38:38.120
Have you noticed Christianity that yells?

38:38.160 --> 38:41.880
I heard the guy debating you talking about moral authority.

38:42.280 --> 38:42.520
Right.

38:42.520 --> 38:46.080
They think, oh, I'm for family values and moral authority.

38:46.360 --> 38:47.280
You got none.

38:47.720 --> 38:54.320
You got zero because you will take a liar and exalt, bring up that

38:54.320 --> 38:58.400
liar to a position and you will bow to a liar.

38:58.880 --> 39:03.320
And we all know, we all know that those liars get fed to those birds.

39:03.800 --> 39:04.080
Right.

39:04.080 --> 39:05.880
That's the life, right?

39:05.920 --> 39:07.880
That's what I thought about this.

39:08.200 --> 39:14.200
I thought about this hard is that I actually have this weird respect.

39:15.160 --> 39:20.680
And I hate to say this, but like, at least the fundamentalist are consistent

39:21.040 --> 39:24.440
and following what the text tells them, where you have these people on the

39:24.440 --> 39:30.680
sidelines who I don't respect, who cherry pick and it's like a buffet of the

39:30.680 --> 39:33.640
Bible's a buffet where they can just, I like this part.

39:33.680 --> 39:34.880
I don't, I don't like that part.

39:34.880 --> 39:39.400
So I'm going to somehow pretend it's not there or, or even just rationalize

39:39.400 --> 39:42.840
it away by explaining it how I want to explain it.

39:43.240 --> 39:48.240
And then you, and then what you're doing is you want, you are making it so

39:48.240 --> 39:50.800
that the fundamentalists can stay legitimate.

39:51.720 --> 39:55.360
Because if you, if you just, if the people on the sidelines who, who are

39:55.360 --> 40:01.040
the moderates who are, you know, using the Bible, like, like a, like a salad bar,

40:01.240 --> 40:04.920
if they actually just said, you know what, this, this text is, this text is

40:04.920 --> 40:05.560
just evil.

40:05.760 --> 40:06.360
I'm out of here.

40:06.800 --> 40:09.920
Then there were, then the fundamentals would be looking like looking naked

40:09.920 --> 40:11.040
in the middle of the street.

40:11.400 --> 40:15.120
They would just be target, like they would be wide open.

40:15.160 --> 40:16.480
There'd be no one to cover for them.

40:16.480 --> 40:17.320
They'd have nothing.

40:18.520 --> 40:22.320
That's cause they're the reason why that the, the fundamentalists are still around.

40:22.840 --> 40:24.520
People, you get the moderates.

40:26.400 --> 40:31.440
Do people push you, um, like to say, Oh, don't be so hard on the Christians.

40:31.440 --> 40:32.360
You ever get any comment?

40:32.360 --> 40:34.720
Like, don't, all the time.

40:34.920 --> 40:35.200
Yeah.

40:35.360 --> 40:41.000
You know what, but I was, I was, I went, I was at a church for years.

40:41.280 --> 40:49.800
That really has an impact that really is like pushing, pushing ideas into the

40:49.800 --> 40:56.000
world that are really negative impact, climate change, El Pro, uh, accepting

40:56.000 --> 40:58.560
people who they are, all that stuff goes out the window.

40:58.560 --> 41:01.680
And this is, these are churches at every corner that you can think of.

41:01.680 --> 41:04.120
Like this is every city, every town has that.

41:04.640 --> 41:06.280
It's not, it's not a small thing.

41:06.280 --> 41:07.120
It's a big thing.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.000
It's a big, it's a big pop.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.600
It's a big population of people that are pushing these ideas.

41:13.200 --> 41:16.440
I'm sorry, but I'm just going to, that's, that's where I'm at right now.

41:16.480 --> 41:19.600
If you can convince me otherwise, but I've seen it, seen it first hand.

41:20.000 --> 41:24.480
I know what I was, I was one of the people who, on the email list for January 6th,

41:25.040 --> 41:28.560
say, Hey, everybody, we, if you need to bust, if you need to ride there, we'll

41:28.560 --> 41:29.320
send you out there.

41:29.760 --> 41:31.000
We need to support Trump.

41:31.400 --> 41:33.360
I was one of those people who were on that email list.

41:34.040 --> 41:36.120
I'm just saying, so I'm coming out of that world.

41:36.120 --> 41:37.600
So that's why I do what I do.

41:38.560 --> 41:40.200
You don't have to do it, but I do it, you know?

41:40.720 --> 41:41.040
Yeah.

41:41.080 --> 41:44.480
And it was a Christian flag that was first, you know, everybody listened to

41:44.480 --> 41:45.760
what Neil said, right?

41:45.760 --> 41:49.920
It was a Christian flag that went first into that, into that capital.

41:49.960 --> 41:55.400
Those people, Neil, that tell you you're, you're being too harsh on the Christians.

41:56.320 --> 41:56.880
Right.

41:56.920 --> 42:03.480
Um, those are the people who in the first century AD, as Christianity was becoming

42:03.480 --> 42:09.400
more and more radicalized, and people were saying, we have to burn down this

42:09.400 --> 42:12.600
place, right, in order to get him to come back.

42:13.680 --> 42:19.760
Um, that's the kind of, that's the kind of the person who stood back at the time

42:19.760 --> 42:21.880
and said, Oh, don't be hard on the Christians.

42:22.400 --> 42:28.680
That was the person who, uh, helped facilitate the fall, um, of Rome.

42:28.840 --> 42:30.280
They, an order.

42:30.280 --> 42:32.200
And when I say Rome, I mean, order.

42:32.320 --> 42:33.120
That's a good point.

42:33.160 --> 42:34.200
That was such a good point.

42:35.480 --> 42:36.080
Exactly.

42:36.280 --> 42:37.000
It's what I'm saying.

42:37.000 --> 42:43.920
It's, it's the people who are the moderates that kind of cover for the

42:43.920 --> 42:46.920
fundamentalist types that, that do the most damage.

42:47.080 --> 42:47.480
Right.

42:47.920 --> 42:51.440
Cause without, it's like that you, you're the gateway to that path.

42:51.480 --> 42:53.800
You're the reason why that, that thing exists.

42:54.040 --> 42:54.360
Yeah.

42:54.560 --> 42:54.880
Yeah.

42:55.000 --> 43:01.160
You know, you know, when the Taliban was, was gaining strength in Afghanistan, you

43:01.160 --> 43:05.760
know, that there were a certain percentage of a population that said, Oh,

43:05.760 --> 43:08.680
this is, this can't be that bad, right?

43:09.600 --> 43:17.600
Whereas, uh, so it's, if we can, if, if we can, uh, show those people the future,

43:18.400 --> 43:22.960
um, before it happens, they can correct, but that's unfortunate.

43:22.960 --> 43:26.920
You know, unless you've got, unless you've got oracles and different sources,

43:26.920 --> 43:32.800
you were talking earlier about polytheism, remember, people don't think this way,

43:32.800 --> 43:38.680
but there's, uh, uh, there are oracles spread all over the place that give you

43:38.680 --> 43:43.640
the voice of God, whether it's she or he, right?

43:43.920 --> 43:45.400
It doesn't matter.

43:45.800 --> 43:51.000
Um, and you can go obtain that voice in one place that's different from another.

43:51.160 --> 43:59.400
That inherent flexibility of the system, of a system that is, uh, integrates the

43:59.400 --> 44:03.320
populace that thrives on diversity, right?

44:03.320 --> 44:03.880
That's what I'm saying.

44:04.040 --> 44:13.120
That the, the layout of that system sort of produces, uh, a zeitgeist.

44:13.120 --> 44:15.880
That's, that's not top bottom.

44:15.920 --> 44:17.080
It's not patriarchal.

44:17.120 --> 44:21.520
It's not, here's the one, one king on top and then the servants.

44:21.800 --> 44:24.080
It's more like spread out.

44:25.080 --> 44:28.800
You have these different, different institutions with their own certain types

44:28.800 --> 44:30.960
of power that there's a balance happening.

44:32.280 --> 44:32.720
You know what I mean?

44:32.720 --> 44:33.920
More of a balance.

44:33.960 --> 44:34.600
Balance.

44:34.600 --> 44:37.160
That's a, that's a Greek idea, right?

44:37.200 --> 44:40.000
Not, not today invented it, but that was big in their minds.

44:40.000 --> 44:45.440
You have to achieve balance and become in thug life where you're selling

44:45.440 --> 44:50.760
everything that you own and putting it at the feet of some thug who's going to

44:50.800 --> 44:53.200
murder you if you don't give it all up.

44:53.440 --> 44:53.840
Look at that.

44:53.840 --> 44:54.280
Right.

44:54.720 --> 44:58.560
By the way, how did people, how did Peter know that he didn't give it all up

44:58.560 --> 45:04.360
unless he either had spies where he had access to the sale itself, which since Jesus

45:04.360 --> 45:09.760
was so hooked into the, to the tax collectors, it's probably likely that

45:09.760 --> 45:13.880
Peter knew exactly cause that, all of that has to be registered.

45:14.160 --> 45:17.360
But not only that, it's a message to the next person coming.

45:18.080 --> 45:19.680
So you remember what happened to Ann and I.

45:19.680 --> 45:23.400
Is there enough, you better give me all that money.

45:23.680 --> 45:25.600
You better not keep a penny for yourself.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.640
And in eyes, you drop dead right away.

45:29.120 --> 45:33.320
It's like a, it's when a mafia leaves the horse head in the bed.

45:34.440 --> 45:35.360
It's a message.

45:35.480 --> 45:36.120
That's what it is.

45:36.120 --> 45:38.000
It's just a strike fear in the people.

45:38.360 --> 45:38.680
Yeah.

45:38.840 --> 45:41.440
If you come here and you join us, you get initiated.

45:41.840 --> 45:42.120
Yeah.

45:42.280 --> 45:46.680
You better give us all your riches, sell all your property and don't keep anything

45:46.680 --> 45:47.320
for yourself.

45:47.440 --> 45:48.760
Don't dare do that.

45:48.800 --> 45:49.560
Are you dead?

45:50.160 --> 45:52.320
But that's, that's intense, man.

45:52.560 --> 45:58.720
If you are a modern Christian and you own property and you have, I don't know,

45:58.720 --> 46:03.400
stocks, um, and you have a real Christian.

46:04.560 --> 46:06.520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

46:06.880 --> 46:11.200
You are an aberration that developed over 2000 years.

46:13.000 --> 46:13.480
Yeah.

46:14.040 --> 46:16.600
The doesn't, doesn't make sense to me, man.

46:16.640 --> 46:19.200
But okay, let's let me get through one more.

46:19.560 --> 46:21.200
We got Ponto Crotor, right?

46:21.200 --> 46:21.920
What's this about?

46:22.000 --> 46:22.360
Yeah.

46:22.360 --> 46:23.720
Here's the Ponto Crotor.

46:23.720 --> 46:31.560
Remember I said the Ponto Crotor is the title that's used by, um, uh, Hermes,

46:32.000 --> 46:34.920
the Angulos, the messenger of Zeus.

46:35.280 --> 46:35.560
Yeah.

46:35.560 --> 46:36.000
Right.

46:36.040 --> 46:41.000
Jesus in Revelation, not only calls himself that messenger.

46:41.200 --> 46:41.720
He's the other.

46:42.600 --> 46:47.680
But even the text itself, John says another angel, Jesus comes out at one

46:47.680 --> 46:51.960
point, um, uh, with a sickle in his hand, we're going to look at it in a minute.

46:52.320 --> 46:56.080
And then another, it says another angel steps out with a sickle.

46:56.360 --> 47:01.680
So Jesus is very much putting himself into this specific role.

47:02.120 --> 47:02.640
Right.

47:02.640 --> 47:04.240
What's he got a sickle for?

47:04.560 --> 47:07.480
You know what he's got a sickle for to cut your guts out.

47:09.080 --> 47:09.640
Yeah.

47:09.680 --> 47:10.240
Yeah.

47:10.240 --> 47:12.040
And what are they all yelling?

47:12.040 --> 47:14.200
You know, Jesus is Lord, et cetera, et cetera.

47:14.440 --> 47:14.800
Okay.

47:14.800 --> 47:15.360
Next one.

47:17.360 --> 47:17.680
Kai.

47:17.800 --> 47:18.160
Yeah.

47:18.160 --> 47:18.400
Yeah.

47:18.440 --> 47:21.280
And I saw the heaven, the heaven open.

47:21.280 --> 47:21.560
Yeah.

47:21.840 --> 47:22.240
Okay.

47:22.240 --> 47:24.960
Here's the description of gangster Jesus.

47:25.040 --> 47:25.600
Are you ready?

47:26.200 --> 47:31.200
And I looked, I saw the heaven open, open.

47:32.040 --> 47:32.440
Yeah.

47:32.480 --> 47:37.340
And look, there was a white horse and there was one seated on the horse called

47:37.340 --> 47:39.460
faithful and, and true.

47:40.220 --> 47:47.220
And in his right hand, he holds a, um, sorry, with his right hand.

47:47.260 --> 47:47.940
Oh, hang on.

47:48.140 --> 47:49.580
The guy was in a clinic.

47:49.580 --> 47:50.820
Kai polemic.

47:51.100 --> 47:57.860
He, um, rules with righteousness and he polemic and he makes war.

47:58.180 --> 47:59.260
He makes war.

47:59.260 --> 48:00.820
Nobody talks about Jesus make war.

48:00.820 --> 48:04.420
We don't have any murals of Jesus, the war maker, right?

48:04.420 --> 48:07.580
But this is what characterizes the thug leader.

48:08.940 --> 48:09.540
Yes.

48:09.540 --> 48:10.100
Right.

48:10.140 --> 48:10.500
Right.

48:10.820 --> 48:12.660
He's literally calling himself the war monger.

48:13.180 --> 48:13.540
Yeah.

48:13.900 --> 48:16.180
And he's also injected in his eyes.

48:16.180 --> 48:17.620
He's got the flocks.

48:17.900 --> 48:22.180
He's got that purple, that burning purple in his eyes and it's the flocks.

48:22.220 --> 48:23.060
Poor us.

48:23.420 --> 48:27.020
That expression is used in Orphic, uh, mystery.

48:27.020 --> 48:29.820
It's like Al Pacino with this, with the cocaine on his nose.

48:30.020 --> 48:30.380
Yeah.

48:30.460 --> 48:31.100
Exactly.

48:31.100 --> 48:32.380
He's lit up.

48:32.860 --> 48:33.700
He's lit up.

48:34.180 --> 48:36.140
This is thanks to Jesus right here.

48:37.260 --> 48:38.900
And he's got lots of gold.

48:38.900 --> 48:39.940
He's got bling.

48:40.060 --> 48:41.020
He's got bling.

48:41.020 --> 48:43.020
He's got crowns, right?

48:43.060 --> 48:47.460
He's got a ton of bling and he has a name, right?

48:47.500 --> 48:49.340
Jesus has a tat, right?

48:49.580 --> 48:50.420
And he has a name.

48:50.420 --> 48:51.220
Oh, yeah, yeah.

48:51.220 --> 48:55.620
The next one, the next one, Jesus has a tattoo on his thigh.

48:55.900 --> 48:59.100
A name, king of kings and lord of, think about that.

48:59.100 --> 49:01.260
You know, you got the old English tattoos.

49:01.660 --> 49:02.020
Yeah.

49:02.420 --> 49:04.860
He's got that old Aramaic tattoo going on.

49:04.860 --> 49:06.580
King of kings and lord of lords.

49:07.460 --> 49:09.980
You know, that, uh, but that's what is it?

49:09.980 --> 49:12.380
That siriac, that siriac font.

49:14.180 --> 49:14.700
You know what I mean?

49:14.700 --> 49:17.060
He's got that tattoo with that siriac tattoo.

49:17.540 --> 49:21.140
Why do you think he, why do you think he tattooed his thigh with it?

49:21.660 --> 49:22.460
Cause he's a G.

49:22.500 --> 49:23.980
He's Jesus, the G.

49:24.500 --> 49:25.500
He's G-man.

49:25.780 --> 49:26.180
Yeah.

49:26.820 --> 49:27.340
Yeah.

49:30.340 --> 49:34.900
This is so, this is so, I honestly, when you look at it this way though,

49:34.900 --> 49:36.700
it almost makes sense.

49:40.380 --> 49:41.860
It makes better sense.

49:41.860 --> 49:42.420
It does.

49:42.420 --> 49:43.340
The fairy tale.

49:43.340 --> 49:44.260
Better sense.

49:44.300 --> 49:44.700
Yeah.

49:44.700 --> 49:45.740
That they come up with.

49:45.780 --> 49:50.180
Can you imagine him flashing it like he lifts up his, he lifts up his gown and

49:50.180 --> 49:52.380
he's like, Hey, take a look at this.

49:52.580 --> 49:53.780
You know, in my fur.

49:54.780 --> 49:57.740
Oh, and it's funny because they're ride or die.

49:57.740 --> 49:58.500
They're martyrs.

49:58.500 --> 50:01.220
They're going to ride or die for their click, for their gang.

50:01.220 --> 50:04.580
They're not going to, you're not letting them, you're not going to get over on them.

50:04.580 --> 50:06.340
They're going to die for that shit.

50:06.340 --> 50:13.660
Like that's a mentality that you see in the mafia and the Italian and the Spanish

50:13.660 --> 50:16.380
and like that's a, that's real.

50:16.380 --> 50:19.500
Like that's, that's no joke.

50:20.500 --> 50:26.260
And imagine though, you've got this drug using gang who's, who's, uh, who's

50:26.260 --> 50:31.300
principal leaders or, or immune to Venoms, right?

50:31.300 --> 50:35.580
And Jesus is like, I'll make you so that you can drink this stuff and it won't

50:35.580 --> 50:37.380
hurt you at all, right?

50:37.380 --> 50:39.740
So, you know, the drugs are there from the beginning.

50:39.740 --> 50:42.580
You know, the drugs are there with them when he gets arrested.

50:42.580 --> 50:44.780
So it's a part of the culture.

50:44.780 --> 50:49.180
Your comparison to gang is, I think it's straight on, man.

50:49.940 --> 50:52.100
Look at how the popes dictated their lives.

50:52.100 --> 50:56.220
Like the, they had the Pope Alexander in the 16th, 15th century.

50:57.060 --> 51:01.540
He had an enemy that wanted to be the pope and this guy does become pope.

51:02.020 --> 51:03.700
It's Pope Julius.

51:03.700 --> 51:07.740
He has two popes later, but this pope didn't want, didn't want to wait around.

51:07.740 --> 51:10.220
He wanted to end this pope's life so he can become the next pope.

51:10.700 --> 51:16.100
Well, he, he ended up apparently, according to the sources, he, uh, he had

51:16.100 --> 51:20.340
an, uh, altar boy child and he was giving him poison every day.

51:20.660 --> 51:23.660
Enough that it wouldn't kill him, but he would become immune to it.

51:24.140 --> 51:28.100
And then he got him hired as the pope's wine checker.

51:29.420 --> 51:33.020
So he would be able to drink the wine and poison in it and he wouldn't die.

51:33.260 --> 51:35.100
Well, the whole operation failed.

51:35.100 --> 51:35.740
The kid died.

51:36.700 --> 51:41.660
But like that, but that tells you the mindset of this church, man.

51:42.100 --> 51:45.500
This is like, these are like mafia bosses fighting over the throne.

51:45.980 --> 51:46.340
Yeah.

51:46.780 --> 51:50.860
And they're, when this is, this is the highest, highest Christianity has to

51:50.860 --> 51:55.100
offer the papacy and the world, they're operating like my bosses.

51:55.300 --> 51:56.420
Why do you think that is?

51:58.020 --> 52:00.380
You think it's just a reality.

52:00.420 --> 52:04.260
You know, it's just like, that's the way the things go when you got lots of money

52:04.260 --> 52:09.740
involved and lots of power and sex, you know, you just, it's going to lean

52:09.740 --> 52:14.020
toward this hierarchy of there's going to be one thug and he's going to run

52:14.020 --> 52:14.860
everything.

52:15.300 --> 52:15.740
Right.

52:15.740 --> 52:19.660
So yeah, I didn't think, you know, I didn't think they were sitting around.

52:19.700 --> 52:22.340
Ha, ha, ha, ha, right.

52:22.660 --> 52:25.900
I, I didn't think that was the reason everybody was there.

52:25.900 --> 52:26.260
Right.

52:26.540 --> 52:29.980
We all know it's, you can take those altar boys into the basement.

52:30.660 --> 52:31.420
You know what I mean?

52:31.540 --> 52:34.340
And you can do things with that's power.

52:34.620 --> 52:35.380
That's what they're asking.

52:35.660 --> 52:37.180
That's real power, man.

52:37.220 --> 52:38.380
Jesus has that.

52:38.860 --> 52:42.140
Let me see that, that long, that long one that I had with him on the white

52:42.140 --> 52:43.700
horse, just go back one.

52:44.260 --> 52:46.540
No, maybe it's one more.

52:48.180 --> 52:49.300
No, that's okay.

52:49.340 --> 52:49.700
That's okay.

52:49.700 --> 52:50.780
Let's just, I'm sorry.

52:50.780 --> 52:51.140
This one.

52:51.460 --> 52:52.340
Yeah, there we go.

52:52.380 --> 52:52.700
Yeah.

52:52.700 --> 52:55.820
And he's going to, he's going to destroy the nations, man.

52:55.820 --> 52:56.900
He's going to rule them.

52:57.140 --> 52:58.860
Says below, he's going to rule them.

52:58.900 --> 53:00.820
And there's a little phrase in Rob doi.

53:02.060 --> 53:08.540
See, did I, it's with a rod of iron, but that Rob done people don't recognize

53:08.540 --> 53:10.700
that Rob done is a religious instrument.

53:11.140 --> 53:13.620
It's used also by the Balkans, right?

53:13.940 --> 53:15.460
And his is made of iron.

53:15.460 --> 53:16.180
You know why?

53:16.380 --> 53:18.940
So he can bang, bust your head open with it.

53:19.500 --> 53:20.860
That's gangster.

53:20.860 --> 53:23.180
This Jesus seated on a white horse.

53:23.500 --> 53:24.900
He's gangster brought.

53:24.900 --> 53:29.300
And by the way, we see in the beginning, he's got his bow and he's got that poison

53:29.300 --> 53:29.740
with him.

53:29.740 --> 53:32.580
So, and here again, he's called the Pantocrontor.

53:32.820 --> 53:34.740
Oh, but one last thing from this.

53:35.060 --> 53:38.180
Look at one, two, three, four, five lines from the bottom.

53:38.180 --> 53:39.900
This is in verse 19.

53:40.540 --> 53:43.540
Yeah, it says, pate tein leinon.

53:43.860 --> 53:46.660
He is treading the wine press.

53:47.140 --> 53:49.460
That leinon is the wine press.

53:49.460 --> 53:54.500
And you should have one, Neil, that is the hymn to Linnaean Dionysus.

53:54.900 --> 53:55.700
Yeah, look at this.

53:55.740 --> 53:56.180
Look at this.

53:56.180 --> 53:57.540
They call him Lyceus, right?

53:57.540 --> 54:00.180
The releaser, the freer, right?

54:00.700 --> 54:04.420
The, that lane route is the press for the wine.

54:04.780 --> 54:09.460
And for those of you who think for those of you who think that they were

54:10.300 --> 54:12.180
you know, God is comparing himself.

54:12.180 --> 54:14.700
He's constantly saying, I'm this wine presser.

54:14.940 --> 54:18.180
They didn't have wine, except in Canaan.

54:18.180 --> 54:22.300
The Egyptians got it from the Canaanites, right?

54:22.300 --> 54:27.580
Because in Canaan, which is not a Semitic word, it's a Hurrian word.

54:28.100 --> 54:31.300
It's a Hurrian word and they were not Indo-European.

54:31.900 --> 54:33.780
And it means, guess what it means?

54:33.780 --> 54:35.260
It means purple.

54:35.260 --> 54:36.820
Yeah, I've seen this before.

54:36.820 --> 54:38.460
That's mind blowing.

54:38.460 --> 54:42.340
Yeah, yeah, at the bottom, at the bottom, I just want you to

54:42.340 --> 54:46.180
notice the last nine here, Rhexikhthon and Linnaean.

54:46.220 --> 54:50.500
Linnaean is that God who treads out the grapes, right?

54:50.500 --> 54:51.740
That's from Revelation.

54:51.740 --> 54:53.340
And this is talking about Dionysus.

54:53.780 --> 54:55.540
This isn't a hymn to Dionysus.

54:55.540 --> 54:57.260
What is that word being Megasthenus?

54:57.300 --> 54:59.180
And the second last word, Megasthenus.

54:59.460 --> 55:01.500
Having incredible strength.

55:01.900 --> 55:02.340
Oh, OK.

55:02.340 --> 55:04.140
Nye is having incredible strength.

55:04.140 --> 55:06.100
He's Rhexikhthon.

55:06.420 --> 55:12.340
He is literally busting the earth or jamming something into the earth.

55:12.700 --> 55:17.500
And guess what we have in one of these texts that I sent you, Nyeal,

55:17.500 --> 55:24.900
it talks about Jesus with the Saturnian scythe or sickle jamming it down

55:24.900 --> 55:25.980
into the earth.

55:26.740 --> 55:27.380
Yeah.

55:29.180 --> 55:30.180
Oh, yeah, here it is.

55:30.220 --> 55:34.540
I see, behold, the white cloud and upon the cloud sat one unto the

55:34.540 --> 55:40.740
Son of Man, having on his head a golden crown, a crusone, and the

55:40.740 --> 55:44.900
Stefanon, crusone Stefanon, and in his hand a sharp sickle.

55:45.980 --> 55:46.820
Drepanon.

55:47.180 --> 55:48.620
Yeah, yeah.

55:49.100 --> 55:55.820
He's got that sickle and he's about to jam it into the earth as his judgment,

55:55.820 --> 55:56.140
right?

55:56.140 --> 55:58.780
This is the exact same thing that Dionysus does.

55:58.820 --> 55:59.820
I'm not kidding you.

56:01.140 --> 56:06.260
For hundreds of years, the workers of Bacchus, they would hear this

56:06.260 --> 56:08.140
and they'd be like, oh, yeah, he's Bacchus.

56:08.740 --> 56:12.020
Yeah, that's that's what I'm trying to know.

56:12.500 --> 56:14.020
So that's what I learned from you.

56:14.020 --> 56:17.060
And this is what I'm trying to relate to people is that the language

56:17.060 --> 56:19.700
in Greek in any doesn't matter what it is.

56:20.420 --> 56:27.060
When you're speaking Celtic language in in Greek, it's going to ring bells

56:27.060 --> 56:29.940
in people's ears in the Greek world, especially people

56:29.940 --> 56:35.220
living in Phrygia, people living in Corinth or the church at Thessalonica.

56:35.500 --> 56:37.900
These people are growing up in the Orphic mysteries.

56:37.900 --> 56:38.980
They're all around them.

56:39.260 --> 56:43.180
This is this is stuff that's this is familiar language to them.

56:44.500 --> 56:47.940
And we lose this context when we, because we're in an English-speaking

56:47.940 --> 56:50.380
world that's a thousand years removed from this.

56:50.420 --> 56:52.620
We have no idea the context anymore.

56:52.620 --> 56:56.780
It's gone, but that's what this is the work you've been doing that I'm

56:56.780 --> 56:59.500
trying to trying to give to the people.

56:59.500 --> 57:03.860
Like there's some context in this reason why they're using this language.

57:04.860 --> 57:06.780
Sure, that's Saturnian.

57:06.980 --> 57:09.140
Yeah, it's Kronos has the sickle.

57:09.140 --> 57:12.940
He's the one who comes in, you know, they have the Thanatos, the God of death.

57:13.260 --> 57:14.900
This this is all in Revelation.

57:14.900 --> 57:18.780
It's not like this is not like I'm pulling out of the airs.

57:19.060 --> 57:23.220
He even says Thanatos death and Hades gave up their dead and then

57:23.220 --> 57:24.540
they're throwing them like a fire.

57:24.900 --> 57:25.340
Right.

57:25.340 --> 57:27.980
And even in the Christian, even in the Christian

57:27.980 --> 57:32.940
manuscript or in the editions of the New Testament, you'll see Hades

57:32.940 --> 57:34.900
capitalized, right?

57:34.980 --> 57:37.300
Because he he's a person.

57:37.300 --> 57:39.340
He's the king of the underworld, right?

57:39.580 --> 57:42.580
And even see where it says the sea gave up its dead.

57:42.820 --> 57:44.700
Yeah, I'm not I'm not kidding.

57:44.700 --> 57:49.140
When I first read that, I remember thinking like, well, you have Hades

57:49.140 --> 57:52.540
and you have you have death and Hades, the sea.

57:52.580 --> 57:56.420
And I didn't know until recently, when I started reading the Orphic hymns,

57:56.900 --> 57:58.900
there was a hymn to thought Thosala.

57:59.180 --> 58:00.660
Yeah, him to the sea.

58:00.660 --> 58:02.300
The sea is also a deity.

58:02.620 --> 58:03.700
Yeah.

58:03.700 --> 58:05.540
No, they got all there.

58:05.540 --> 58:06.700
It's all in Revelation.

58:06.700 --> 58:07.380
It's all there.

58:07.380 --> 58:09.220
And it's all Saturnian, too.

58:09.220 --> 58:11.740
And that's that's why when you read these hymns, you're shocked.

58:11.740 --> 58:14.260
You're like, wait a minute, they're using the exact same symbols.

58:14.260 --> 58:18.460
The image that they're using in Christianity, which only makes sense.

58:18.860 --> 58:21.500
I mean, come on, they didn't sit around and Jesus didn't say,

58:21.740 --> 58:22.900
let me make up something.

58:22.900 --> 58:24.420
Yeah, let me just pull out of this.

58:24.420 --> 58:27.220
Pull this out of the out of the void of some black hole.

58:27.220 --> 58:33.340
Like these are ideas that come passed down from other ideas, the evolution.

58:33.340 --> 58:34.940
All ideas come from something.

58:34.940 --> 58:36.820
Yeah. Yeah.

58:36.820 --> 58:38.780
All right, let's finish these quotes because I'm.

58:38.780 --> 58:40.660
Yeah, these are great.

58:40.660 --> 58:41.860
We're on fire right now.

58:41.860 --> 58:44.020
So this is one Jesus kills and feeds to the birds.

58:44.020 --> 58:45.180
We did this one, right?

58:45.180 --> 58:46.020
Yeah, we did that one.

58:46.020 --> 58:48.300
Oh, no, here's the one we got to read.

58:48.300 --> 58:48.620
Here's.

58:48.620 --> 58:50.420
Oh, OK.

58:51.060 --> 58:55.740
This is like, this is admitting that you're on some G shit right here.

58:55.740 --> 58:58.140
This is there's no hiding it.

58:58.140 --> 59:01.900
These shall hate the whore and shall make her desolate naked.

59:02.300 --> 59:04.700
She'll ease her flesh and burn her with fire.

59:05.900 --> 59:09.540
For God had put in their hearts to fulfill his will.

59:09.940 --> 59:14.500
Yeah, that's why I like to start with the ending of that one, right?

59:14.500 --> 59:16.140
Which is at the bottom in Greek.

59:16.140 --> 59:18.700
It literally just says they all said they can.

59:18.980 --> 59:27.740
God gave into their hearts the idea, right, to follow his Nome, right?

59:27.740 --> 59:30.820
His desire and what is his?

59:30.820 --> 59:32.380
What is God's desire then?

59:32.380 --> 59:34.900
What does he have in his mind to do?

59:35.500 --> 59:39.060
They're going to me say something, they're going to hate her

59:39.660 --> 59:44.980
and they're going to stripper naked and they're going to

59:45.460 --> 59:49.060
consume her flesh.

59:49.060 --> 59:52.700
And this word for flesh, sarks, there's a reason that Paul

59:52.700 --> 59:54.580
associates it with sexuality.

59:54.580 --> 59:57.700
He says, don't follow the flesh, follow the spirit.

59:58.260 --> 01:00:01.540
This sarks is the fleshy pulp of a fruit.

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:04.780
When you bite into it and you get all that juice out of it.

01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:10.620
That's what that's what they are consuming of her

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:14.700
after she has been thrown into this bed.

01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:18.500
Right, she's going to be thrown into this bed and they're going

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:22.780
to cut the calcium, they're going to burn her up in the fire.

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:26.460
Now, this is what's weird, is that cut the cow is used

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:31.740
in religious concept context and it's used to burn that piece

01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:36.500
of incense that you get that Smyrna that comes from between the legs

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:41.940
of Aphrodite, you burn that and it creates an odor, right?

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:43.660
So what is going on?

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:50.460
God is sitting there watching this orgy, this rape orgy, right?

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:56.220
That ends up in her getting totally consumed and it's what's in his mind.

01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:59.820
And don't forget, don't forget this, but right before this or not

01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:04.700
right before this, a few 15 chapters before this, he's coming out

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:08.620
and saying, nevertheless, talking to the church of Pergamon,

01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:13.020
saying that woman, Jezebel, I will cast her on a bed.

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:16.380
And send my minions to rape her.

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:19.180
Yeah, that's the mistranslation in the English.

01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:21.940
The Bart Ehrman pointed this out.

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:24.220
And I asked you about it and you were like, he's not on it.

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:27.220
Bart's spot on, that's what the Greek says.

01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:30.180
And then it says, I will strike her children dead.

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:33.020
We're murdering children now?

01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:37.580
And then he says on the bottom, I'm the morning star.

01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:41.580
He say, right after he says, those are the people who will learn

01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:45.380
of the deep things of Satan, I'm the morning star.

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:49.820
Yeah, that's like, what's he's saying?

01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:51.340
You know, there's Satanists.

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:53.340
No, they had nothing on me.

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:54.620
I'm Lucifer.

01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:59.660
Which that's how I'm reading you right now.

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:03.260
But like it's it's what it sounds like.

01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:05.460
He moves in on the territory.

01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:06.500
He takes it over.

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.700
He's the new leader, man.

01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:09.260
He's the new.

01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:11.220
You think you know about this stuff?

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:12.820
Yeah, watch this.

01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:14.580
Yeah, now I'm going to kill you all.

01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:20.340
Yeah, this and look at this and look and low.

01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:26.700
A lamb stood on the Mount Sion and with him 144,000, having his

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:29.140
father's name written in their foreheads.

01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:31.660
Now here's some more gang stuff right here.

01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:36.740
And I heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters, as the voice

01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:38.020
of the great thunder.

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:41.540
And I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps.

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:43.300
There's that Orphic imagery right there.

01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:48.380
And they sung as it would the new song before the throne and before

01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:52.780
the four beasts and the elders and no man could learn that song.

01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:59.260
But the 144,000, which were redeemed, these which were not defiled

01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:01.900
with the woman, for they are virgins.

01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:06.380
What's Jesus doing with 144,000 virgins?

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:10.460
And I'll bet you they're branded with a with a with a tattoo on their

01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:11.340
foreheads.

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:14.060
Yeah, of course they are because they're sex slaves.

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:14.900
Exactly.

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:16.260
That's the whole point of that verse.

01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:18.380
Yeah, that's crazy.

01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:19.380
Yeah.

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:24.140
And by the way, when it says they are virgins, that's that's not like

01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:27.300
physically, that's that's like a cultically.

01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:29.140
Like it means like they're mine.

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:30.500
They only belong to me.

01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:31.620
Right.

01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:32.460
Am I right about that?

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:34.820
They're Parthenon calls them.

01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:35.980
I checked this one out.

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:36.980
They're Parthenon.

01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:43.500
So it's it, you know, we talk about Athena Parthenos, right?

01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:48.780
I'm saying in the context that he's saying, he's saying that these only

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:50.020
they only belong to me.

01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:51.740
Nobody else has access to them.

01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:53.100
They're my slaves.

01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:54.260
Right, right, right, right.

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:55.900
No, exactly.

01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:57.660
That's exactly that's dark.

01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:57.820
Yeah.

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:01.060
That's why it troubles me when he's arrested in the Garden of

01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:03.420
Gethsemane at 4 a.m. with a naked boy.

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:08.020
Mark says that that boy was assigned to him, right?

01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:15.580
That he was it uses a verb that you only use with slaves and military.

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:16.220
Right.

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:18.900
You can talk about somebody in the military being assigned.

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:19.860
Right.

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:26.620
So it's like what's going on here that Jesus is attracting to himself.

01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:32.340
These, you know, slaves who are, you know, in this case, they're virgins.

01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:36.460
And, you know, is it and he's yelling, I'm not a pirate.

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:38.020
I'm not a kid trafficker.

01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:40.340
You didn't have to come out with the big weapons.

01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:41.700
I'm not a kid trafficker.

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:42.380
Right.

01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:43.260
Yeah.

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:47.180
Peter, though, what do you think gang wise when Peter took off, right?

01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:47.900
Jesus is there.

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:49.140
The boy takes off.

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:55.220
Peter starts swinging with a sword, knocks off that guy's ear and then takes off.

01:04:56.020 --> 01:05:01.820
Uh, do you think it's just like, um, gang lord got taken down, right?

01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:06.660
So, uh, we're going to step off and then does Peter just decide along the

01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:10.700
way he's like, Hey, I've got the apparatus going here.

01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:15.460
I've got enough followers that we can liquidate all of their cash and we can

01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:18.980
drive, drive this, this gang forward.

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:19.860
I don't know.

01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:20.460
What do you think?

01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:22.420
He's the Petros.

01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:23.300
He's the rock.

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:24.820
He's the under boss.

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:30.020
He's like under the Godfather, there's that, that, that, that, that, you know,

01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:33.620
the main boss that's right underneath and get, he's the one doing that, making

01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:35.060
sure everything gets done right.

01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:38.860
And so I'm not surprised that he's pulling out a weapon.

01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:42.500
Make sure things get done the way it needs to be done.

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.700
Like he can't, you know, and then, and then what happens?

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:45.940
Jesus, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:46.980
Put it away.

01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:48.140
Okay.

01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:48.500
Okay.

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:49.380
Boss, you got it.

01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:53.180
It's like a scene out of a scene out of a Godfather scene right there.

01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:53.740
You know what I mean?

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:55.980
Like put the gun down, Tony.

01:05:56.980 --> 01:06:01.980
That's Petra, but you know, he's the one who ends up starting the church, right?

01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:03.620
He was the one who goes to the room.

01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:08.980
And, uh, so that's, that's, that's the original Godfather, the first pope right

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:11.700
there, according to the tradition.

01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:14.300
Are you muted?

01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:18.100
You muted.

01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:22.060
Peter ends up in and out of jail too.

01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:25.700
So they, they're catching on to what he's doing.

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:31.740
I mean, he, he obviously is making a presence and he's able to get out of jail.

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:34.980
It, it makes you wonder, look, Judas was there, right?

01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:38.540
We all know Judas was an informant, right?

01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:39.380
No problem.

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:40.420
He's an informant.

01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:46.980
How much, to what extent could those three guys that were with Jesus when he got

01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:52.220
arrested with that naked kid, what were they, how much could they have been in it?

01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:57.980
Do you think Peter could possibly have known that things were going down with

01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:58.580
Judas?

01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:04.620
Do you think that was, he just tried to make a show like, you know, if he can

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:08.420
kill Anna nice on the spot, he could have killed that guy that he swung at.

01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:12.940
Was he just, was he just trying to, you know, make a show or something?

01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:15.740
No, I think, I think he was ready.

01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:17.820
I think he was ready for something to pop off.

01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:18.780
I think there was something.

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:20.740
Yeah, I think you're, I think you're on.

01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:22.620
And, and, you know, Dr.

01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:27.780
Tabor talks about this is that people want to make it seem like Jesus and Peter

01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:31.860
were a bunch of poor fishermen that had no, no, no, no, no.

01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:37.140
This is, you know, people don't, people don't remember or talk about or write

01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:41.660
about or fixate on people who are just randomly homeless.

01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:48.540
Like this is probably some wealthy, like, you know, some sort of movement happening.

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:49.900
There's something going on here.

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:51.620
There's some, this is a movement.

01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:57.300
This is not just some little group of people that magically blew up and became

01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:59.980
the world, the state religion of the Roman Empire.

01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:03.700
This is a systematic movement that's going on.

01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:08.700
You've got to think if they, if they become so popular, they spread all

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:09.820
the way over to Rome.

01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:10.500
Right.

01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:17.020
And if you're thinking that Peter is taking people's goods and redistributing.

01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:17.620
Yeah.

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:20.380
And he's, and he's taken everybody.

01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:25.500
I mean, how many people, I mean, and it can be anybody, wealthy people, I'm

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:27.100
sure, also got involved.

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:28.020
Absolutely.

01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:32.820
How much, if the movement is so big that it spreads to Rome and throughout Asia

01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:36.500
minor, how much did people bring to Peter's feet?

01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:40.180
I'll bet he had the most gold on the planet.

01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:41.860
Yeah.

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:46.780
Oh, if you have, I'm going to Toronto in two weeks to talk to, uh,

01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:50.700
Professor Kloppenborg at Toronto University, he wrote a book about this,

01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:55.860
that's called Christ Associations, where he documented, he's looking at all

01:08:55.860 --> 01:09:02.180
like the stellies and stones and, and like, in like imprints in, in catacombs.

01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:04.900
And he's putting together the pieces of the puzzle.

01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:10.100
And these are like early Christian labor or labor unions, basically.

01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:11.820
They're organized.

01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:18.220
They're all like the, like the city of Corinth, the stone masons had had a church

01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:19.300
and they were organized.

01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:24.260
The city of Alexandria, the wood carpenters, they had a church, they were

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:24.620
organized.

01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:27.660
This is an organized network of assemblies.

01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:31.340
And he even the first thing, the first thing he does in the first chapter is he

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:33.900
redefines that word Ecclesia.

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:37.500
We, we say church, but it really means assembly.

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:40.700
And this, it's a, it's a broader term than just church.

01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:44.780
These are groups of people, networks of people that are organized.

01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:47.140
There's a reason why they were so successful.

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:48.500
They were organized.

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:53.940
And they say, he says that up until, I guess, in like maybe the second or

01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:58.700
third century, if you, if you had a loved one died, you had to go through

01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:01.780
the assemblies and they're most likely Christians.

01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:03.020
That's how they got their power.

01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:09.700
They took, they infiltrated the, the, the, um, what do you call it?

01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:13.900
When someone dies, uh, funeral home places, they were, they were the ones that

01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:15.300
infiltrated and took those over.

01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:16.740
You know what I mean?

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:20.780
But it kind of reminds me of like today where you see these funeral homes and

01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:24.740
they got Italian names and it's like, maybe it's a mafia in front of it.

01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:26.220
Like, like it's just like a front.

01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:26.740
You know what I mean?

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:27.620
Who knows?

01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:28.980
Throwing ideas out there.

01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:32.940
No, it makes me wonder what makes me, I'm seriously thinking that though.

01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:34.020
I'm not, I'm not getting around.

01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:39.660
It makes you wonder how much cash was flowing back to those original

01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:44.540
apostles and particularly Peter, because he's named as the keeper of the keys.

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:44.820
Right?

01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:45.940
Like that's another thing.

01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:52.260
Why is this gangster, uh, Magus, uh, involved with children and prostitutes

01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:54.180
and tax collectors?

01:10:54.540 --> 01:11:02.900
Why does he walk around in that, um, in that state saying, Hey, Peter, rock,

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:05.620
um, I'll give you the keys.

01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:06.900
What, what is that?

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.140
What the, what does that mean?

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:09.380
Right?

01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:14.140
We, we look through the, through the fairytale and we think, Oh,

01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:16.460
I'll give you the keys, right?

01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:19.460
What the, no, no, what's he, what did he mean when he's going to give him the

01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:20.900
keys somehow he did?

01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:24.220
Cause Peter ends up making a ton of money off the deal.

01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:32.780
He got it, it got to the point where the church of Rome is claiming that they

01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:36.460
came from like, this is Peter's thing, right?

01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:43.260
Like that's, it's the point that he don't, he's put up as like the successor

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:48.260
almost, if you will, like the book of X starts off before you even get to Paul.

01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:50.660
Peter's the one reviving dead people.

01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:53.500
He's the one who's Peter resurrects a dead person in the book.

01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:55.340
Forget about that.

01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:57.100
It's not just Jesus resurrecting dead.

01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:58.540
It's also Peter.

01:11:58.540 --> 01:11:59.740
And then Paul does it too.

01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:00.620
Yeah.

01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:06.340
And he's battling, he's battling that Simon Magus who wants the piece of the

01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:08.020
action, he wants any action.

01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:11.380
And Peter's like, no, cut him out, cut him out.

01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:11.660
Right.

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:14.260
He was a good, he was a good thug, man.

01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:17.820
The Simonians were like another rival gang, if you will.

01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:21.860
And so the, the, the history gets written by the victors.

01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:27.580
The Simonians end up getting written in this, the text where Peter and Simon,

01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:30.460
Simon, Magus, they have a show off.

01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:31.820
They have a showdown.

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:37.700
It's like a, like a, like a Western gun, like a, you know, bit Billy Barton.

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:41.020
And, and what's his name and badass Billy Joe.

01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:44.300
And they're having their little, they got their guns pointed at each other.

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:45.540
And Peter wins.

01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:47.620
Peter shoots him down, dead, done.

01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:48.700
And that's what happens.

01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:51.900
It says in the text that Simon Magus, this is not an act.

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:56.060
This is an apocryphal text, but it says in the apocryphal text that Simon Magus

01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:57.900
goes, let's see what you got, bro.

01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:01.060
And he starts flying in the air and he's just flying.

01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:02.420
Like, look how powerful I am.

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:03.580
Look how much power I got.

01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:08.780
And Peter goes, really dog, really dog, boop, and makes them fall down dead.

01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:10.580
And then Peter wins, dude.

01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:13.300
Like, Peter is more powerful than Simon Magus.

01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:15.340
And it's like, that's the message that you get.

01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:19.420
But you almost, it almost makes you wonder, what's behind this message?

01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:23.620
Or was there, was there a warring factions of Christians in Rome?

01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:24.420
I think so.

01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:26.980
The archaeology sure as hell shows us this.

01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:30.660
The, the evidence shows us this, that there was more than one Christian group

01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:35.140
going on in Rome, Simonians read Irenaeus and, and Hippolytus.

01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:39.540
They're talking about the Simonians being all over Rome, worshiping Simon Magus

01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:40.540
as a Christ.

01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:42.460
Simon Magus was the Christ.

01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:43.940
Yeah.

01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:51.460
He was offering, and he was offering that female avenue as well, that you get

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:54.380
through the or through the Ophites.

01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:59.340
You remember in selling his wife, Helen, and entering her into this, all the

01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:03.540
stuff that the Nicolations were doing with their, brought with their wives.

01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:09.380
Now, if this ecclesia, if this thing that, you know, we say church and we think

01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:16.060
fairy tale, huh, and no, if this assembly that starts out is able to, you're able

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:21.980
to have others crop up, other unions crop up in other places that are, have the

01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:27.300
same hierarchy and Paul, not as Paul, it's the same gangster stuff.

01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:32.420
He's writing the church at Rome saying, Hey, thank you for the donations.

01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:32.740
Right.

01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:35.180
Thank you for, I understand that you're trying to help me.

01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:36.900
This is what we're doing.

01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:37.180
Right.

01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:39.260
It's the, we will repay that gesture.

01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:39.780
Don't worry.

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:41.260
Oh, the message.

01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:43.100
We're, we're, everything's good over here.

01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:43.940
Yeah.

01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:44.980
Yeah.

01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:45.820
That's what it is.

01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:46.780
Hmm.

01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:51.180
And he's so hyped up on drugs for those of you like Paul and I'm talking to all

01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:56.100
the, all the people who just drool all over Paul, the apostle was, no, what an

01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:57.580
intellect, what a great guy.

01:14:57.980 --> 01:14:59.140
He's doing his thing.

01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:04.660
He's so drugged that he gets bitten by an ass, but it doesn't hurt him.

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:05.460
Doesn't hurt him at all.

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:09.460
And he shakes it off like, eh, because he knows what that venom is like.

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:09.740
Right.

01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:12.020
He knows it because he's been shoving it.

01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:18.260
If he's, I recently, I've recently come to the conclusion that that part of the

01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:24.220
text is trying to say something to the certain people who are initiated into

01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:29.060
these serpent, serpent sex of Christianity, the Nazis, the old fights.

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:31.780
That that's like a, a nod to them.

01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:36.740
And that passage of acts where it's like Paul got bit by the serpent, nothing

01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:37.140
happened.

01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:41.380
And the people, those old fights are reading this text like, oh, shit.

01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:42.300
Yeah.

01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:43.540
Yeah.

01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:44.500
He's one of us.

01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:49.700
That's why Jesus says, I'm shocked that Jesus says, you know, you can expose

01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:52.260
yourself to this stuff and it's not going to hurt you.

01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:52.460
Right.

01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:56.420
He can show these things, right?

01:15:56.660 --> 01:15:57.900
And people are never understand.

01:15:57.900 --> 01:15:59.460
They think fairy tale.

01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:03.780
They think, um, Charlton Heston playing Moses and Easter.

01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:04.620
Right.

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:10.260
They don't, they don't think, uh, what's the reality going on, man?

01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:11.300
Paul was juiced.

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:14.380
Paul was juiced and there was money involved.

01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:16.660
And there's a woman, a Lydian woman.

01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:20.140
I think her name is Lydia involved in the purple trade, right?

01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:24.900
That stuff keeps coming up and keeps coming up and keeps coming up.

01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:29.780
So these early Christians were not only gangsters, but they were into the drugs,

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:30.100
man.

01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:31.580
I'm going to throw this one up.

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:34.940
This is one of the last ones we have, but I got a real quick cause I drank so

01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:39.100
much tea that I got to take a piss or throw this up so you can read it.

01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:40.020
And I'll be right back.

01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:40.980
Okay.

01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:42.140
I will read it.

01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:46.940
And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth.

01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:51.980
Again, this is just like Dionysus does and gathered the vine of the earth and

01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:55.140
cast it in the great wine press of the wrath of God.

01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:59.180
And for those of you who think that they were, um, the Jews were

01:16:59.420 --> 01:17:02.460
grapes, they weren't, it was a Canaanite industry.

01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:07.460
And the wine press was trodden without the city and blood came out of the wine

01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:13.740
press, even unto the horses bridles, but a space of 1,600 furlocked.

01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:18.900
Oh my God, this blood is the blood that he's bringing out of you and me.

01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:24.100
Bra, when he comes back, this is the blood that he's going to produce.

01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:28.780
He's going to put us in that press and he's going to squeeze out blood.

01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:36.540
That is not, that is not the savior that you and I see in church, right?

01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:42.260
If they had a giant painting of a dude that was forcing your head into a wine

01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:48.180
press and squeezing out your guts and blood and one giant mess that was as

01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:50.860
high as, that was as high as a horse's bridle.

01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:54.860
How high is a horse's bridle comes up, can come up to your chest, you know,

01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:57.660
if you ever stand next to a horse, right?

01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:04.340
So, and it says in, in Apocalypse, it says there, his garments are stained with

01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:07.180
blood, stained with blood bra.

01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:14.420
That is a dude that you and I can get behind and say, this, this guy is going

01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:15.980
to take us all the way.

01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:18.020
This is what gang members look for.

01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:21.740
They look for that strong leader to take us all the way.

01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:24.620
You know, unfortunately, Peter, God is ending.

01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:27.060
They caught up with him, which they always do.

01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:32.900
Gang leaders always get screwed in the end because they inevitably run a

01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:35.660
foul because they're organized crime.

01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:38.900
They inevitably run a foul of the civic authorities.

01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:42.460
Jesus did it with the Romans, got himself crucified.

01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:46.020
Peter did it, got himself crucified, right?

01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:54.740
It's, it's almost like that hope of Roman civilization was to preserve that ethos,

01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:59.580
that, that understanding of that the law governs.

01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:04.140
And when you have a group that are organized crime, when you have a group

01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:12.580
that's functioning based on that black market, you can't, you can't look at

01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:16.140
Jesus's image when he's sitting there with Mary and she brings out this

01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:20.140
stuff that is so expensive, you could have given it to the poor and fed a

01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:21.100
whole bunch of people.

01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:22.460
Instead, she uses it on him.

01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:28.940
My question is, what is their gang doing with those resources, right?

01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:32.700
These are black market resources and they're using them.

01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:34.180
They're using them.

01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:35.820
Jesus is in it deep.

01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:40.500
So when he's arrested with that kid in the public park at four in the morning,

01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:43.780
maybe it's not so strange.

01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:45.020
Is that part of the bling?

01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:46.380
Is that part of the thing?

01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:47.180
You're with that kid.

01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:49.420
You're in the right, getting hyped up.

01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:54.700
You're entering that mode and he thinks he, he's genuine thinking he's the

01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:56.340
son of God, right?

01:19:56.380 --> 01:19:58.700
He's very genuine in that, right?

01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:00.420
Yeah.

01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:04.220
So good for him for Dionysus and Thug life.

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:04.820
I love it.

01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:05.180
Yeah.

01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:08.460
He's the, he's the cronion son, the son of Kronos.

01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:11.220
Like he's trying to, that's what he's going for.

01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:18.700
He's going, he's trying to set up a, a mystery right out of the culture that he's

01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:20.100
in, like, you know, that's what it's at.

01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:22.260
That's what it very much seems like.

01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:24.420
That was the last slide.

01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:27.220
But before I even get to, there's some questions people want to ask about the

01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:30.820

And then to inspire them to say, Oh man, maybe this field is actually interesting.

01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:50.020
Yeah.

01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:54.340
Professors out there do everything they can to kill interest in the field by

01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:56.180
doing the most boring stuff.

01:21:56.900 --> 01:21:57.700
But yeah.

01:21:58.340 --> 01:21:58.900
Yeah.

I'm going to, I'm going to do that.

01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:10.340
I think Neil, it's an honor to have you on.

And for those of you who are out there, who are following Neil and following, you know,

01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:29.060
Yeah.

01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:30.020
For the better.

01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:31.620
I can't, I can't describe that.

01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:35.700
I like to say you, you learn somebody when you fight against them.

01:22:36.260 --> 01:22:39.620
And I learned honor through fighting with Neil.

01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:41.460
I want you guys to know that.

01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:45.620
And this man loves the muse and he's, he's honorable servant.

01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:47.220
So thank you, Neil.

01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:47.620
Thank you.

01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:48.660

01:22:59.540 --> 01:22:59.780
Okay.

01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:00.260
Talk to you.

01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:02.580
So yeah.

01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:08.260
So, you know, he had to go and I apologize if you, uh, sent a super chat towards him.

01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:13.060
I'll do my best to, uh, accommodate whatever I can stop scamming, man.

01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:14.500
Thank you for the super chat.

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:17.380
Can you provide any insight into the meaning of the Greek word and the New

01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:22.340
Testament, which translates English to demon also do any, it's a good question.

01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:30.500
Cause you got the word daemon, which kind of just translates to God, but in the Christian

01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:38.340
sense, it kind of becomes demon where it's like a bad God or like some sort of demonic spirit.

01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:44.180
That's as best as I could do on answering that question, but, uh, I apologize that I'm

01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:49.860
won't have to leave, but, uh, I really, you know, you know, some of the, I get people on,

01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:51.780
they only have a certain amount of time to be here.

01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:52.980
So I apologize for that.

01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:54.660
Morrison prophecy.

01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:55.540
Thank you for the super chat.

01:23:55.540 --> 01:23:56.980
I finally caught one of these lives.

I love your channel.

Cheers.

01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:03.620
Awesome.

It's good to see you, Morrison.

01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:06.020
Thank you for that.

01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:08.020
Stop scamming, man.

01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:08.500
Hello again.

01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:13.460
Can you provide any insights on the Greek words for heaven and paradise the New Testament

01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:16.500
uses and do not, and any question, right?

01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:17.780
Our nose is heaven.

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:19.860
Paradise.

01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:25.300
That's an, um, let me see what, uh, Perseus stuffs has for paradise.

01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:27.620
Paradise.

01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:28.260
I don't even know.

01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:29.460
Paradise.

01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:32.500
Paradise in Greek.

01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:36.340
Paradisos.

01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:37.220
Paradisos.

01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:41.300
So, uh, let me see if I can share my screen.

01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:44.100
Yeah.

01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:45.860
So you have our nose, which is heaven.

01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:48.100
It's the same one for the God, our nose.

01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:50.500
And then Paradisos.

01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:57.860
Parad, Paradiso, Paradiso, Paradiso, Paradiso.

01:24:58.980 --> 01:24:59.380
Yeah.

01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:00.500
That's the best I could do.

01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:01.220
Sorry about that.

01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:02.740
Thank you for the super chat.

01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:03.380
I appreciate that.

01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:07.540
I wish I could, uh, you know, I wish I was an expert in Greek and can help you out with that.

01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:10.340
Thank you for that though.

01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:18.740
Cthonious, my boy, Cthonious, who was Jesus's father?

01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:21.620
God, to me, it's the Old Testament.

01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:23.460
God, the Jews rejected him.

01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:25.220
Did his God have a secret name?

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:25.540
Yeah.

01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:26.260
I think you're right.

01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:33.140
He claimed to be the son of, yeah, Yahweh, you know, he can, he claimed to be the son of

01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:39.940
the Old Testament, the biblical God, you know, so that's a definite,

01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:41.700
that's definitely, that's definitely the thing.

01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:46.020
