1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Abram was 75 years old when he left Haran.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:12,480
Abram took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all of their possessions and those who became

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,920
members of their household in Haran, and they set out for the land of Canaan.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,520
When they arrived in Canaan, Abram traveled through the land as far as the sacred place

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,320
at Shechem, the Oak of Mora.

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,600
The Canaanites lived in the land at that time.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:38,400
The Lord appeared to Abram and said, I give this land to your descendants.

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,120
So Abram built an altar there to the Lord who appeared to him.

9
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,880
The religious beliefs of Israel are rooted in the shared culture of Canaan,

10
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:07,440
although it had unique attributes that differed from the Canaanites.

11
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,080
It still found expression in shared practices and language.

12
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,160
Some traditional practices could not be merged with Yahwism,

13
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,720
but others like the sacred poetry, the music, and the architecture of the Canaanites

14
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,160
were adopted and became integral to the Israelite religion.

15
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,720
The Old Testament's embrace or rejection of these elements

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:46,280
means that the Canaanite religious influences still affect us today through biblical narratives.

17
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:53,200
The things that the Bible are condemning in the Old Testament are, in fact,

18
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,600
the culture that the Israelites at the time of writing the Bible

19
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,360
are trying to distance themselves from in their own past.

20
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:09,080
Things like human sacrifice, idolatry, and the worship of more than one God.

21
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,240
These are the things that they themselves practice just like everyone else in the world.

22
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:20,760
And these are the things that they will polemicize in the text to divorce themselves from their past.

23
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,960
Before the findings at Ugarit Rosh Shamra in 1928,

24
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:39,880
our knowledge of Canaanite religion was minimal and largely from indirect sources.

25
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,720
The Old Testament didn't mention Canaanite deities and rituals,

26
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,440
but these were often in a negative light making interpretations challenging.

27
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:56,200
Mentions of Canaanite gods and rituals were also found in Egyptian, Mesopotamian, and Phoenician writings,

28
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,000
including the Karatepe inscriptions from 1946.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,600
However, these weren't enough to form a complete understanding.

30
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,320
Greek historians provided accounts of Canaanite beliefs,

31
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,240
but it was hard to distinguish authentic traditions from later additions,

32
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,520
excavations at places like Biblos and Megiddo.

33
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,520
Give us glimpses, but only a fragmentary picture.

34
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:27,600
Thanks to the discoveries at Rosh Shamra, ancient Ugarit in North Syria,

35
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,640
the Canaanites tell us their own story.

36
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,680
Hundreds of clay tablets found here, written in a dialect close to the biblical Hebrew,

37
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,120
and offers rich insights.

38
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:48,040
These tablets feature extensive mythological poems, records related to the temple services,

39
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:55,400
lists of deities and sacrifices, and details about temple workers and rituals.

40
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Additionally, artifacts linked to gods like Baal and Dagon,

41
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,800
including temple remains and stelae, have been discovered.

42
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:12,640
It's crucial to understand, though, that while there was a core Canaanite religious belief,

43
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,920
local variations existed.

44
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,520
I mean, they didn't have the internet and no email and the mail system wasn't very great.

45
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,080
So every city you went to had their own ideas.

46
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:31,440
Not every Canaanite city would have worshiped all the same gods that we know from these texts.

47
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,320
There were variations at play.

48
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,720
The Canaanite religion was more of a public affair than a personal one.

49
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:46,520
Its rituals, mostly centered on ensuring fertility, were community events.

50
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:52,440
Though there were individual acts of devotion as seen in the Phoenician inscriptions,

51
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,720
the religion was mainly a communal way to connect with nature's forces.

52
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,800
This involved practices believed to ensure continued creation and rejuvenation.

53
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,440
The prominence of some deities in mythological writings

54
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,040
doesn't always reflect their actual popularity among Canaanite devotees.

55
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,520
Conversely, some gods like Dagon had a minimal role in myths,

56
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,760
merely acknowledged as Baal's father,

57
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:27,920
but seemed quite revered as evidenced by a dedicated temple and two stele in Ugarit.

58
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,960
El, the Hebrew word for God, is the supreme God and Creator

59
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,480
and shows up as Allah in Arabic.

60
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,520
Variations in the name El are found in many Semitic languages,

61
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,480
Ugaritic, Phoenician, Hebrew, Aramaic, Akkadian.

62
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:58,160
In Northwestern Semitic cultures, El was a term for any deity

63
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,120
and also specifically for the primary god.

64
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,880
He often stood at the top of many divine hierarchies

65
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,960
and played roles like the god of creation

66
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,240
or the father of gods in certain Canaanite and Ugaritic sources.

67
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,360
Yet, using the name El can be confusing

68
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,880
because sometimes it refers to the main god and at other times to different gods.

69
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:28,600
For instance, in Ugaritic texts the phrase El-Melik means El the king,

70
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,600
while El Haddad refers to the God Haddad.

71
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,480
In Ugaritic, the plural for gods aligns with the Hebrew term

72
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,640
that sometimes means the singular god Elohim, for example.

73
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:49,400
Some believe that various authors change stories from polytheistic context

74
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,600
into monotheistic ones.

75
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,200
I myself subscribe to this idea and I will show this in this video.

76
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,880
And this causes many inconsistencies in the text,

77
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,200
but once you see it, everything starts to make sense.

78
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,120
Names with the stem El appear in many Semitic regions

79
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:17,920
among the Amorites and Sabaic people in the southern Levant.

80
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,800
Several ancient texts in inscriptions mention El

81
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,640
or connect him with other deities from different cultures,

82
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,040
indicating his widespread recognition and influence.

83
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:36,760
For instance, the Egyptian god Patah shared an epithet with El

84
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,600
and an ancient script described El as the god of eternity.

85
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:49,200
The Egyptian deity Patah was labeled Lord of Gath in a prism from Tel Lakish.

86
00:07:49,200 --> 00:08:00,720
And on the other side, it bears the name of Amenhotep II, Pharaoh from 1435 to 1420 BCE.

87
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:09,440
This title also appears in Serabit text 353.

88
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,760
Ta is frequently referred to as Lord or the Eternal One.

89
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,560
This association between El and Patah that brought about the consistent use of olam,

90
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,200
meaning eternal, for El.

91
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,600
Although in Ugaritic records, Ta seems to be more closely related

92
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,760
to the artisan deity Kothar Wachasus, an additional link is observed

93
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,720
with the Mandian angel Patah El, blending the names Patah and El together.

94
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:48,720
Herodotus, the famous Greek historian who wrote in the 5th century BCE,

95
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:55,080
who never mentions anything about Israel, Jerusalem or Yahweh or anything like King David or Moses,

96
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,360
does have some interesting things to say about the god Patah,

97
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,320
who he calls by his Greek equivalent Hephaestus.

98
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:10,520
After the reign of the priest of Hephaestus Patah, the Egyptians were made free,

99
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:17,680
but they could never live without a king, so they divided Egypt into 12 districts and set up 12 kings.

100
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,200
These kings intermarried and agreed to be close friends,

101
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,840
no one deposing another or seeking to possess more than another.

102
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:32,200
The reason for this agreement, which they scrupulously kept, was this.

103
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,840
No sooner were they established in their districts than an oracle was given them,

104
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:42,920
that whichever of them poured a libation from a bronze vessel in the temple of Hephaestus Patah,

105
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:49,240
whereas in all the temples they used to assemble, would be king of all Egypt.

106
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:58,920
Now what I found interesting about this text is the division between the 12 tribes, if you will,

107
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,280
of the ruling class of Egypt at this time, and it makes you wonder,

108
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:12,120
could this be some of the source material used for the curation of the 12 tribes in the story in Genesis?

109
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,200
The 12 districts itself wouldn't be too convincing,

110
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:26,120
but when you take a look at El or Yahweh, being a god of metallurgy and craftsmanship,

111
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,440
and the uncreated one, like Patah, there's might be some connection here.

112
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:48,440
Patah is an Egyptian deity responsible for creating the world, manifesting it through

113
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:57,560
potent force of spoken words. A hymn from Egypt's 22nd dynasty praises Patah for shaping the world

114
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:06,200
with the vision of his hearts. Meanwhile, the Shabakha stone, originating from the 25th dynasty,

115
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:13,960
mentions Patah bestowed life upon all deities and their spirits using his heart in his voice,

116
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:21,800
the curation by the voice, something we see in the god of the Old Testament. His worship then moved

117
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,720
beyond the borders of Egypt, all the way into Syria, and was exported throughout the eastern

118
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,800
Mediterranean. Through dissemination by the Phoenicians, we find figures of Patah and Carthage,

119
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:39,800
his epithets, Patah, the begetter of the first beginning, Patah, Lord of Truth,

120
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:47,160
Patah, Lord of Eternity, one who listens to prayers, master of ceremonies, master of justice,

121
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,280
the god who made himself to be God, the double being, the beautiful face.

122
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,240
Now, some of you watching this right now may be familiar with the Heliopolis in Aeneid,

123
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:05,960
and the creation myths that say that Amun, or Atum, is the self-created craftsman

124
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:12,680
who created the other gods. And though this is certainly true, the priesthood in Memphis and

125
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:21,960
Crocodopolis and the elephantines have competing mythologies that make Patah the self-created

126
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:31,720
demiurge who creates the other gods and humans. An elephantine, Cunum, who like Patah, is also

127
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:38,840
depicted as a craftsman or demiurge with the potter's wheel behind him, just as Patah has

128
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:44,440
images of himself with the potter's wheel behind him, as he creates gods and humans alike.

129
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,360
Porphyry once said, At the city of Elephantine, there is an image worshiped, which in other

130
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:05,240
respects is fashioned in the likeness of a man and sitting. It is of a blue color and has a man's

131
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:13,480
head and a diadem bearing the horns of a goat. He sits with a vessel of clay beside him, on which

132
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:19,400
he is molding the figure of a man, and from having the face of a ram and the horns of a goat,

133
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:28,200
he indicates the conjunction of sun and moon, ra and ya, in the sign of the ram, Amun, while the

134
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:35,880
color of blue indicates that the moon in that conjunction brings rain, Tefnut. He goes on to say,

135
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:44,760
in the mysteries of Eleusis, the Hierophant is dressed up to represent the demiurge and the

136
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:52,280
torchbearer, the sun, the priest at the altar, the moon, and the sacred herald, Hermes. Moreover,

137
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:57,960
a man is admitted by the Egyptians among their objects of worship, for there is a village in

138
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:05,240
Egypt called Anibis, in which a man is worshiped and sacrifice offered to him, and the victims

139
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,920
burned upon his altars, and after a little while, he would eat the things that had been prepared for

140
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:17,720
him as for a man. They did not, however, believe the animals to be gods, but regarded them as

141
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:23,560
likenesses and symbols of gods, and this is shown by the fact that in many places,

142
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,400
oxen dedicated to the gods are sacrificed at their monthly festivals and in their religious

143
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:34,440
services, for they consecrated oxen to the sun and moon.

144
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:44,360
What I find the most striking about this passage is his comparison to the Eleusinian priests,

145
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:51,400
Abakus and Demeter, Na'kunum, who Pharaoh Khufu was named after, the famed builder of the Great

146
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:59,000
Pyramid, Giza. Almost seems like a perfect synchronization between the competing creator gods

147
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:05,480
Amun Ra and Patah. Patah is one of the three major gods of the Memphis Triad,

148
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:13,000
along with Sekhmet, and he's also the father of Nefertim, and Kunum has an almost identical role

149
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:19,560
within the Elephantine Triad. The temple of Elephantine was dedicated to Kunum, his consort

150
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:26,520
Saitis and their daughter Anuket. Elephantine is the city where dozens of Jewish Aramaic texts were

151
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:35,080
found, that not only physically predate every fragment or manuscript of Hebrew Bible in existence,

152
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:44,520
I repeat, the Elephantine city where we found older Jewish Aramaic fragments than any

153
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:53,000
existing fragment or manuscript of the Hebrew Bible in existence. But also, it shows that the

154
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,360
Jews at Elephantine in the 4th and 5th century BCE were still polytheistic during this time.

155
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:08,520
Following the 587 BCE destruction of Jerusalem, some Judean refugees traveled south in what may be

156
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:18,520
called an Exodus in reverse, settled at Elephantine. They maintained their own temple, the House of Yahweh,

157
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:26,440
or Yahoo in this case, in which sacrifices were offered, evincing polytheistic beliefs

158
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:34,840
functioning alongside that of Kunum. Gods like Osiris and Isis are all over the place in these texts.

159
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:42,680
The temple was destroyed in 410 BCE at the instigation of the priests of Kunum.

160
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:49,880
So, what happened? Was Yahweh in direct competition with Kunum over who is the true

161
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:57,960
divine craftsman? Possibly. One of the most common attributes among these metal-ergy

162
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:04,840
craftsmen gods like Hephaestus of the Greeks, Ta of the Egyptians, and Vulcan of the Romans,

163
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:12,200
is their connection to volcanoes and mountains due to the richness of metal ores found at these

164
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:19,160
places. It is very possible that Yahweh is no exception, although he is from an entirely different location.

165
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:30,760
In Exodus, the presence of fire and smoke is paired with the mountains quaking.

166
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:38,440
These tremblings, akin to small earthquakes, are typical of volcanic eruptions,

167
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:46,760
leading to the expulsion of warm gases from the cracks. This expulsion is accompanied by a

168
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:53,880
significant sound, referred to in the Sinai Theophany as powerful shofar sound.

169
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:24,280
Yahweh's revelation is always at a mountain, whether called Sinai or Horib, the event pictured

170
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:30,760
like a volcanic eruption. As these texts show, volcanism seems to be an essential attribute,

171
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:37,880
typically associated with Yahweh, linking him to the Kressman metal-ergy gods as I mentioned before.

172
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:44,600
The account of the Sinai revelation, with its volcanic imagery, is meant to show that Yahweh

173
00:18:44,600 --> 00:19:01,160
himself is not just his divine emissary, but a demiurgic craftsman. Some believe Mount Sinai

174
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:07,960
might be one of these Arabian volcanoes, which the Israelites approached in the text when departing

175
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:15,240
Egypt. Jacob Dunn even theorized that Yahweh was once an Arabian volcanic deity. This ties

176
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:22,840
into the theory that Yahweh's worship in Israel has Midianite roots. This theory draws from biblical

177
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:30,840
references that depicts Moses' introduction to Yahweh in Midian. Near the mountain of God,

178
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:40,280
close to Jethro's residence, in Exodus 3, 1-6, here Moses is instructed by God to bring the

179
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:49,000
Israelites after their Egyptian Exodus, Exodus 312. Intriguingly, Moses' father-in-law is portrayed

180
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:58,040
as a Midianite priest, suggesting Moses might have adopted local religious beliefs from him.

181
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,760
In other passages, Moses' father-in-law is identified as a Kenite. Some Kenites settled

182
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:13,080
in Israelite lands and maintained a close alliance with them. The biblical figure Cain,

183
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:19,880
considered the Kenites founding ancestor, is significant in early biblical narratives,

184
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:26,920
highlighting this group's ancient proximity to Yahweh. Cain's role as the initial person

185
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:38,120
offered to Yahweh in Genesis 4-3 reinforces this notion. While Yahweh's association with the Midianites

186
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:46,360
might explain Israelites using volcanic imagery to depict the divine presence, linking Yahweh

187
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:53,640
to the Kenites prompts a reevaluation, especially considering the Kenites'

188
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,560
metal-urgical pursuits.

189
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:12,440
The Kenites seem to have been skilled metalworkers. Genesis 4 discusses Cain's descendant,

190
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:20,440
Tubel Cain, as a craftsman skilled in molding copper and iron. Semitic cognates of Cain hint

191
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:28,440
that metal-urgical activities were integral to its meaning. Hence, Cain might originally have been

192
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:36,840
represented the pioneering figure in metalurgy with the Kenites, both metalworkers and smelters,

193
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:45,960
as his successors. Their association with the volcanic deity, like Yahweh, becomes clear in

194
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:53,400
this context. Historically, deities linked to metalurgy were also connected with volcanoes.

195
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:00,280
For instance, Hephaestus was linked to Mount Etna in ancient Greece, and the term volcano

196
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:07,880
originates from the Roman god of metalurgy, Vulcan. The connection between volcanoes and

197
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:13,880
metal smelting is straightforward. Both release similar owners and plumes of smoke.

198
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:21,080
In past times, smelting was the sole human activity involved in melting stones,

199
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:30,200
lava pouring from volcano, mirror slag from a furnace, which once solidified resembles volcanic

200
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:39,080
rock. This similarity is evident in Exodus' description of the Sinai Revelation, comparing

201
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:49,320
the ascending smoke to that of a furnace, Exodus 1918. The persistent use of volcanic imagery

202
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:57,000
when describing Yahweh implies a deep-rooted metal-urgical aspect to his earlier identity.

203
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:06,280
Notably, the Song of Deborah associates Yahweh near Ereba's copper mines. This volcanic aspect

204
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:12,840
of divine revelation is also highlighted in Deuteronomy's account of the Horeb Revelation.

205
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,680
It notes that Yahweh communicated from amidst fire and smoke,

206
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,880
essentially from the volcano's core, while it erupted.

207
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:33,480
Oh Yahweh, when you came forth from Sire, advanced from the country of Edom, the earth trembled,

208
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:40,680
the heavens dripped, yea, the clouds dripped water, the mountains quaked or flowed before

209
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:45,800
Yahweh, the one of Sinai before Yahweh, God of Israel.

210
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:55,080
The writings in Zechariah support this idea. The book starts by sternly rebuking the earlier

211
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:01,640
prophets of Israel, accusing them of abandoning the paths of Yahweh and ignoring his call.

212
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:09,800
Zechariah 1, 4-6, this assertion is further elaborated when the text predicts the arrival

213
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:20,280
of four rescuers, dispatched by Yahweh, referenced as Smiths, and Zechariah 2, 3-4, Smiths,

214
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:28,920
and subsequent revelation, Zechariah 6, 1-5. Zechariah witnesses four soaring chariots,

215
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,600
representing the four winds, originating from the bronze mountains.

216
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:41,800
This terminology alludes to the copper mining regions, like Ereba and Sinai,

217
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:49,960
hinting at Yahweh's earlier residence. Thus, even in Zechariah's time, there were those who

218
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,560
recalled Yahweh's association with metalurgy.

219
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:10,120
Recognizing Yahweh's historical role as the deity overseeing metalurgy in the Southern Levant,

220
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:20,520
sheds light on various aspects of his biblical character. In fact, Yahweh is nowhere to be found

221
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:29,000
in any of the Ugaritic or Northern Canaanite texts or inscriptions, which are dominated by El

222
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:36,280
and Bell. As well as different craftsmen God, Kothar Wachasus, who I mentioned earlier,

223
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:43,960
who is identified with Ptah in texts that survive from Memphis, as well as Anki of the Babylonians.

224
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:52,600
So, Yahweh is most likely local to the Southern Levant, near the Sinai Desert and Midian.

225
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:04,760
In Isaiah 31-9, an oracle of Yahweh, whose fire is in Zion, in his furnace in Jerusalem,

226
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:14,520
imagery of metalurgy undeniable here surrounding Yahweh. This could also help explain the biblical

227
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:22,440
author's attempts to polemicize Bell as an evil opposition to Yahweh, considering how popular

228
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:30,280
Bell was to northern Israel, and being the prince and son of El. He only has to be opposed by Yahweh.

229
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:37,640
While many view this portrayal as merely a symbolic expression without deeper theological

230
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:45,080
meaning, considering the other metallic attributes associated with Yahweh, it probably reveals

231
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:52,040
a metallurgical facet to Yahweh's worship in Jerusalem. In this perspective, the numerous

232
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:59,240
metal artifacts in the Jerusalem Temple aren't just symbols of grandeur. Their context largely

233
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:05,640
details an exodus via the depiction of the Tabernacle. It specifies about the metals used,

234
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:11,560
hint at deeper theological importance they held. They symbolize the heavenly furnace

235
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:19,480
within the Israelite sanctuary, turning it into the earthly abode of the Israelite deity. Moreover,

236
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:27,960
the copperclad altar in the Temple's grounds lends a metallurgical undertone to the sacrifices.

237
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:35,880
The glow from this copper surface, when heated to nearly 1000 Celsius, for the burning sacrifices,

238
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,920
is reminiscent of the luminance of liquefied copper or gold.

239
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,760
The beginning of the Prophet Ezekiel's vision recounts his entrance into the heavenly realm

240
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:59,720
as follows. And I looked and behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud

241
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:07,160
with a fire flashing up and brightness around it, and in its midst, something like Hasmal,

242
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:14,040
out of the midst of the fire. The vision illustrates Hasmal, an entity radiating

243
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:20,760
powerful luminance amidst celestial flames. This unique term is exclusively found in Ezekiel's

244
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:27,880
revelation within the Bible. However, comparable words appear in both Egyptian and Akkadian,

245
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:35,480
Hashmen and Hashmalu, referring to an amber or yellowish-orange metal or metallic mixture.

246
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:42,680
The Septuagint translates it as helectron, signifying either amber or electron,

247
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,400
a natural blend of gold and silver. While many translations peg Hashmel as amber,

248
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:55,560
this interpretation doesn't quite fit, given the reference to the glowing embers within the flame.

249
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:03,800
In Ezekiel 1.13, it's more likely that Hashmel alludes to something shining brilliantly due to

250
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:12,040
high heat, considering that burning amber emits smoke but not light. It stands to reason that

251
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:17,800
Ezekiel 1. Hashmal is more likely a representation of liquefied metal.

252
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:29,000
When they moved, I could hear the sound of their wings like the sound of mighty waters,

253
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:37,320
like the sound of Shaddai, a tumult like the din of an army. In Ezekiel's depiction of these beings

254
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:45,640
and their movement, it seems he's detailing the powerful gusts that fuel the celestial furnace,

255
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:52,680
enhancing the creation of shining embers. Essentially, this vision portrays Yahweh's

256
00:29:52,680 --> 00:30:00,440
divine realm as a massive kiln encircling by winged entities that drive the air current

257
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:07,160
akin to bellows. Taking into account both Ezekiel's imagery and Isaiah's analogy,

258
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:12,520
it becomes clear that these prophetic insights symbolize Yahweh's manifestation

259
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:18,520
in both the celestial and terrestrial realms through the imagery of a colossal furnace.

260
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:24,600
This emphasizes the strong ties of his worship to the world of metallurgy.

261
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:31,720
The oldest plausible occurrence of his name is in the Egyptian land of Sashu Yahweh,

262
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:41,320
an inscription from the time of Amenhotep 3rd, 1390-1352 B.C. The Shasu, being nomads from Midian.

263
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:50,600
Yes, Midian, there you go again, and Edom in Northern Arabia. This gives the Yahweh as a Midian God,

264
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:55,880
way more plausibility. When we look at the Greek sources like Herodotus and Plutarch,

265
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:01,080
for which gods are worshiped in this region, they both claim that it's Dionysus and Venus

266
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,840
that are the main gods worshipped here. One might immediately dismiss this

267
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:13,480
due to the blatant differences between Greek Dionysus and Yahweh. However, the Bronze Age

268
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:20,680
Dionysian religion was so widespread and his worship flourished from Turkey down to Egypt

269
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:25,960
along the Mediterranean. So if Yahweh was connected to this ancient god in any way,

270
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,960
he would almost barely resemble him anymore by the time of antiquity. It's possible that Yahweh

271
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:39,880
could be a metallurgy volcano god with Dionysian attributes. For example, figures like Tacitus,

272
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:47,320
John the Lydian, Varro draw parallels between Yahweh and Bacchus Dionysus. Often Jews employed

273
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:56,200
symbols commonly linked to Dionysus, including chylixes, amphorae, ivy leaves, and grape clusters.

274
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:02,440
Plutarch highlighted these resemblances to argue that the Jews venerated a version of Bacchus

275
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:09,720
Dionysus. In Plutarch's questions in Moralia, he points out that Jews praised their deity

276
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:16,120
using the exclamations Iwa Sabao, chants that are typically related to Dionysus.

277
00:32:39,880 --> 00:33:03,000
This is just many of the hundreds of Dionysian imagery that is found throughout the Hebrew

278
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,360
Bible, including the fact that the temple was designed with golden vines and golden grape

279
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:14,600
clusters throughout the sanctuary designed by Solomon, with golden satyrs who are the race of

280
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:21,720
daemons that are led by Dionysus to battle. In the ancient Greek text, many biblical parallels

281
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:27,480
and allegories are associated with the vine. The children of Israel are referred to as a vine

282
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:35,400
in Isaiah 5-7 and in Isaiah 9-10, Isaiah likens God as the owner of a vineyard,

283
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:41,480
and Israel is the vineyard. The grapevine is one of the seven species with which the land of

284
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:48,920
Israel was blessed. Deuteronomy 8-8, an ample supply of wine symbolized prosperity and well-being,

285
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:56,040
and overflowing that symbolized divine blessing. Every man under his vine and under his fig tree

286
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:02,920
symbolizes the idealized past and hope for a future peace. Threats of national disaster

287
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:08,040
were couched in terms of laying waste to the nation's vines and fig trees.

288
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:16,520
Hosea 2-14, Joel 1-7, the vines in blossom symbolized the passing of winter. Song of Songs 2-13,

289
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:24,920
and the ripening of fruit represented a fulfilled state of being, Joel 2-22. Although the fruit

290
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:31,720
of the vine was eaten fresh or dried, the plant was primarily valued for its fermented juice,

291
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:37,560
which was considered an appropriate gift of royalty. A description of Israelite culture

292
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:43,720
is provided by Isaiah and his parable concerning a vineyard. Let me sing for my beloved. A song

293
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:50,360
of my beloved about his vineyard. My beloved had a vineyard on a fruitful hill. He broke the ground,

294
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:57,640
cleared it of stones, and planted it with choice vines. He built a watchtower inside it. He hewed

295
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:09,320
a winepress in it, Isaiah 5-1-2. Many ancient depictions of Dionysus are shown as a man riding

296
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:14,680
a donkey, according to multiple sources, one of them which includes Manacias of Rhodes, who claims

297
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:21,880
that Antiochus IV raided the temple of Jerusalem, found within the Holy of Holies a golden donkey

298
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:29,320
with a man riding on it. According to Tacitus, when Pompey the Great raided the temple of Jerusalem,

299
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:36,520
all he found within the Holy of Holies was a golden ivy diadem, a symbol of none other

300
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:43,560
than Dionysus Bacchus. A coin was released by Pompey to commemorate his triumph over Judea,

301
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:51,240
which displayed a bearded individual on his knees holding a branch with the caption Bacchus

302
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:59,480
Judeus. This can be translated as either the Jewish Bacchus or Bacchus from Judea. Some interpret

303
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:05,560
this figure as representing Yahweh as a regional version of Bacchus or Dionysus. However, considering

304
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:10,920
such coin designs usually showcase subjugated individuals, rather than the deities of the

305
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:17,000
conquered, others believe it might symbolize a Judean whose name was Bacchus. This figure is

306
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:24,200
sometimes thought to be the Hasmonean king Aristobelus II, whom Pompey defeated. Regardless,

307
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:31,720
one of the many titles of Dionysus was Yaho or Yacus, and the Phrygians in the east called him

308
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:41,000
Savatsios, a god who was later identified by Romans as Theos Hipsistos, which means god most high,

309
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:50,120
the initial Jewish settlers in Rome faced expulsion in 139 BCE. Cornelius Hyspilus,

310
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:56,440
acting under a law that forbade spreading the corruption of worship of Jupiter Savatsios,

311
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:04,200
banished the Chaldean astrologers and the Jews. Nias Cornelius Hyspalus pray to our

312
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:10,200
peregrinus in the year of the consulate of Marcus Populus Lannis and Lucius Calpurnius,

313
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:17,160
ordered the astrologers by an edict to leave Rome and Italy within 10 days, since by a fallacious

314
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:24,520
interpretation of the stars they perturbed fickle and silly minds, thereby making profit out of their

315
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:30,920
lies. The same praetor compelled the Jews who attempted to infect the Roman custom with the

316
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:39,800
cult of Jupiter Savasios to return to their homes. This action suggests that Romans possibly equated

317
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:46,520
the Jewish Yahweh Tsavaot, meaning lord of hosts, with Job Savatsios.

318
00:37:46,520 --> 00:38:06,120
Plutarch posited that the Jews revered Dionysus and celebrated the Sabbath as a tribute to Savatsios.

319
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:13,320
Additionally, he explored the idea of equating the Jewish god with the Egyptian entity Typhon,

320
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:21,080
although he later dismissed this association. Meanwhile, the monotheistic Hypsasterians revered

321
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:26,680
the most high using a name that might have been linked to the Jewish deity Herodotus,

322
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:33,480
who, like I said, never mentions Israel or Jerusalem or Yahweh, does happen to describe

323
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:41,240
a local religion somewhere between Mount Sinai and Phoenicia, possibly Midianite territory,

324
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:47,000
who have a similar ritual as described in the Hebrew Bible, such as the priests wearing similar

325
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:54,200
white and blue robes with golden tassels that are seen among priests of Dionysus and Demeter

326
00:38:54,200 --> 00:39:01,560
and Eleusis and the blood oath rites, which seem to look very similar to Leviticus blood oath rites.

327
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:07,720
He is to dip his finger into the blood and sprinkle some of it seven times before the Lord

328
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:14,760
in front of the curtain of the sanctuary. Now compare this to the right the Herodotus records

329
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:20,440
among these local Arabians. There are no men who respect pledges more than the Arabians.

330
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:28,440
This is how they give them. A man stands between two pledging parties and with a sharp stone cuts

331
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:35,960
the palms of their hands near the thumb. Then he takes a piece of wood from the oak of each

332
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,720
and smears with their blood seven stones that lie between them.

333
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:47,800
Meanwhile, calling on Dionysus and the heavenly Aphrodite. In both cases, the blood is sprinkled

334
00:39:47,800 --> 00:40:02,760
or smeared exactly seven times to seal the oath. A painting on a jar found at Kuntalit

335
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:09,960
under the inscription Yahweh of Samaria and his Asherah dated to 800 BCE, possibly the male

336
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,640
and female pair that Herodotus thought was Dionysus and Aphrodite. In an inscription discovered in

337
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:23,640
Iron Getty and dated around 700 BCE, Yahweh appears described as the Lord of the Nations.

338
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:30,760
While in other contemporary texts discovered in Kierbet Laya near Lakish, he is mentioned as

339
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:39,080
the ruler of Jerusalem and probably also of Judah Yahweh in the form of Yaho. It is frequently

340
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:45,960
invoked in Greco-Roman magical texts dating from the 2nd century BCE to the 5th century of the

341
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:54,760
Common Era, most notably in the Greek Magical Papyri under the names Yaho, Adonai, Sabaoth and

342
00:40:54,760 --> 00:41:02,600
Eloi. These are also used as Bacchic chants among Dionysian religious revelers at this time.

343
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:10,200
Use of Yaho becomes blurred by the usage. Since the 2nd century BCE, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans

344
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:17,480
had identified the evil god Seth Typhon, often depicted as a donkey-like creature with the Jewish

345
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:25,320
god Yahweh. The Seth Yahweh tradition with all its negative valence was then applied to the

346
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:32,440
Creator worshiped by the Christians as well. Evidence for this view comes from the early

347
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:41,720
Christian depiction of the Creator and his sons in donkey or typhonian form, the oldest manuscripts

348
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:48,840
of the Greek Septuagint, Old Testament in Greek, before the Church editions came in the 4th century

349
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:59,800
show Yaho in them for Leviticus 327 and 427. These are replaced with the uniform Curios or Lord

350
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:06,760
in the 4th century Church codexes of the Sinaiticus, Alexandricus, and Vaticanus.

351
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:14,600
I think it is very possible that we have in Yahweh a warrior, Demiurgic craftsman,

352
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,960
with ancient Bronze Age Dionysian elements passed down through the rites and traditions.

353
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:26,840
Although much closer to something like Vulcan than of Dionysus, this Yahweh, the local craftsman

354
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:34,520
metal-urgy god of the southern Levant, became infused with El, the chief god of the Canaanites,

355
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:42,280
to become Yahweh Elohim. This also puts him in direct opposition to Baal, the prince and son of El

356
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,200
in the northern Canaanite religion.

357
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:00,040
For Canaanites in the broader Levantine region, El was the highest god,

358
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:07,080
fathering notable gods like Baal and Yam. In Ugrit, El was married to the goddess Asherah,

359
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:13,720
but no temple was dedicated solely to him. Numerous titles and attributes describe El

360
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:21,800
from being a creator and king to a wise elder. Some myths feature him prominently, such as

361
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:29,800
a tale where he encounters two women by the sea and fathers the deities of dawn and dusk.

362
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:37,880
In an Ugritic story, El hosts a feast for the gods on Mount Lel, which may indicate

363
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:47,160
he lived in a tent explaining his lack of a dedicated temple. This text also suggests

364
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:54,360
he might have resided near sources of saltwater and freshwater in the text Palace of Baal story.

365
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:01,800
Baal Haddad, commonly known as Dagon's son, is occasionally referred to as El's son,

366
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:09,640
hinting at El's overarching authority over the gods. Another fragmentary text depicts El

367
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:17,080
inviting gods to a banquet where he gets embarrassingly drunk, showcasing his human-like flaws

368
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:26,120
Regarding the god El, he was seen as the preeminent deity residing atop the monumental Mount Saphon

369
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:33,960
where all gods convened, similar to Mount Olympius. Ugritic texts referred to the collective gods

370
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:42,360
as El's offspring, or all the gods to divine assembly. El was esteemed with titles such as

371
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:49,560
creature maker, the monarch, the Baal El, and humanity's father. Even though royal attributes

372
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:56,760
were primarily ascribed to El, he often came across as a figurehead, sometimes distant and

373
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:04,440
inactive, resembling what experts termed far-off supreme deity, something like we see in Zoroastrianism

374
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:11,720
with Zorvan. He lived in a celestial realm, termed the sources of the two deeps, where he

375
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:18,840
attended to visitors and dispatched directives via envoys, imagined as a kind of elderly figure.

376
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:26,680
El was sometimes named El the Benevolent. Eisfelt suggests that this particular characteristic

377
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:32,680
might have influenced the Israelites to envision their god Yahweh with more compassionate traits.

378
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:39,480
The name El likely stems from the root Yowl, meaning powerful or chief, and is believed to be

379
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,520
a descriptive term, as referenced by W. F. Albright in his works.

380
00:45:54,520 --> 00:46:00,200
But the belief system of the Canaanites, a group of Semitic peoples from the ancient Levant,

381
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:06,520
spanned from the early Bronze Age up to initial centuries of the common era.

382
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:12,680
This religion was characterized by the worship of multiple deities and, in certain instances,

383
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:19,400
the exclusive veneration of one god while acknowledging the existence of others. The

384
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:27,960
Pantheon and Ugarit referred to the deities Elohim or El's descendants. Thilo of Biblos,

385
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:33,800
in the first century, Phoenician writer, who cited Sakoniethin of Beirut,

386
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:39,640
priest from the Bronze Age apparently, identified the chief creator god as Elian.

387
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:46,200
He was considered the progenitor of other gods. Greek records mention his union with Beirut,

388
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:53,720
symbolizing the city of Beirut. Such divine city unions can also be drawn parallel with

389
00:46:53,720 --> 00:47:04,520
Melkart and Tyre, Kamash and Moab, Tanit and Balhaman in Carthage, and Yah with Jerusalem.

390
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:12,360
El-Eliyan's relationship with Asherah can be likened to the Greek tales of Kronos and Reia,

391
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,440
or the myths of Saturn and Ops.

392
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:28,600
At about this time, the descendants of the Dioscary put together rafts and ships,

393
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:35,560
and made voyages, and, being cast ashore near Mount Cassius, consecrated a temple there,

394
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:43,080
and the allies of El, who is Kronos, were surnamed Elohim, as these same were surnamed

395
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:50,040
after Kronos, what have been called Kroni. It was a custom of the ancients in great crisis

396
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:56,520
of danger for the rulers of a city or nation in order to avert the common ruin to give up the

397
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:02,520
most beloved of their children for sacrifice as a ransom to the avenging daemons, and those

398
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:09,640
who were thus given up were sacrificed with mystic rites. Kronos then, who the Phoenicians

399
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:16,760
call El, who was king of the country subsequently after his disease, was deified as the star Saturn,

400
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:24,040
and had by a nymph of the country named Anna Brett, an only begotten son, whom they call on

401
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:29,800
this account, Ye dude, the only begotten, still so called among the Phoenicians,

402
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:37,800
and when very great dangers from war had beset the country, he arrayed his son in royal apparel,

403
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:45,160
prepared an altar, and sacrificed him. Kronos also, in going around the world,

404
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:52,200
gives the kingdom of Attica to his own daughter Athena, but on the occurrence of a pestilence

405
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:59,960
and mortality, Kronos offers his only begotten son, as a whole burnt offering to his father Orinos,

406
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:08,280
that circumcises himself, compelling his allies to do the same. This has obvious parallels to the

407
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:16,040
story of Abraham, sacrificing his son Isaac on the altar. But then being stopped at the last minute,

408
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:22,600
which is the polemic against the old ways, the story of Abraham is an obvious euhemerization

409
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:28,040
of the text about El and Kronos, and archaeologists and Canaanite scholars

410
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:34,760
claim that the practice of child sacrifice was rampant among Canaanites in the first millennium

411
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:40,760
BC, as is clear from the frequent biblical allusions, as well as from the fact that tested

412
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:46,360
by Roman witnesses that the Carthaginians were migrated from Phoenicia in the 9th and 8th century

413
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:53,640
BC, practiced human sacrifice on a large scale. Down to the fall of Carthage, the root of this

414
00:49:53,640 --> 00:50:00,760
practice in Punic religion is illustrated by the fact that it had not seized by the 3rd century

415
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:07,480
of the common era. Despite repeated Roman efforts to wipe it out, the Babylonians also

416
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:14,680
practice this due to the ritual of dressing sacrifice victim in royal purple to imitate a

417
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:21,800
substitute king and slaying them in public square. Our best source occurrences are the archaeological

418
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:32,680
remains from the royal death pits at early dynastic Ur from 2600 to 2500 BCE, and textual records of the

419
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:38,440
substitute king ritual that was practiced at least from the early 2nd millennium BCE,

420
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:45,960
down to the time of Alexander the Great. These rituals were known and practiced far and wide,

421
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:52,040
and El, who was also called Cronos, was at the center of these.

422
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:04,920
Again, would it not have been far better for the Carthaginians to have taken Critias or

423
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:11,800
Diagoras to draw up their law code at the very beginning, and so not to believe in any divine

424
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:18,360
power or god rather than to offer such sacrifices as they used to offer to Cronos.

425
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:27,240
With us, for instance, human sacrifice is not legal but unholy, whereas the Carthaginians

426
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:32,920
perform it as a thing they account wholly and legal, and that too when some of them sacrifice

427
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:38,520
even their own sons to Cronos, as I daresay you yourselves have heard.

428
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:47,560
And from then on to the present day they perform human sacrifices with the participation of all,

429
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:53,640
not only in Arcadia during the Laikeia and in Carthage to Cronos, but also periodically

430
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:59,480
in remembrance of the customary usage. They spill the blood of their own kin on the altars,

431
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:05,640
even though the divine law among them bars from the rites, by means of Perahenterra,

432
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:12,200
and the herald's proclamation anyone responsible for shedding of blood in peacetime.

433
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:21,080
Was chosen as a sacrifice for the city, for from ancient times the barbarians have had a custom

434
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,960
of sacrificing human beings to Cronos.

435
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:38,360
In Leviticus 1821, in Deuteronomy 1230, the Torah contains a number of in-laws forbidding child

436
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:46,200
sacrifice and human sacrifice in general. The Tanakh denounces human sacrifice as barbaric

437
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:53,560
customs of Baal worshippers. For example, Psalm 106-37, this is another example of the

438
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:58,840
biblical authors detaching themselves from the past of ancient Israel. It is impossible to

439
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:05,960
reconstruct some of the details of Canaanite ritual from references in the Old Testament.

440
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:14,440
1 Kings 18 describes the contest of Elijah, the prophets of Baal, on the summit of Mount Caramel.

441
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:21,080
The latter are said to have leaped about the altar, to have cut themselves after their manner

442
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:28,040
with knives and lances, till the blood gushed out upon them. The gashing with knives is found in

443
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:34,600
the description of El's mourning of the dead Baal, as well as in the writings of Lucian of

444
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:42,360
Samosota in the 2nd century, whose states that the custom was characteristic of the ceremonial

445
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:51,560
mourning of Adonis, which was performed annually at the Syrian sanctuary in Hierapolis, also known as

446
00:53:51,560 --> 00:54:05,480
the Holy City. Moloch, sometimes written as Molech, was a Canaanite god mentioned in the

447
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:12,760
biblical accounts with child sacrifice. The name combines the consonants from the Hebrew word

448
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:20,280
Melch, meaning king, with the vowels from Boshet, meaning shame. In the Old Testament,

449
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:27,560
Boshet is often used as an alternative name for the widely recognized god Bael, who translates to

450
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:35,480
Lord. Moloch is also depicted in the Septuagint in Amos 6, with the star god Rhefane.

451
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:53,320
In the Hebrew, it's Sikkoth and Chion, instead of Moloch and Rhefane. This text directly connects

452
00:54:53,320 --> 00:55:00,440
Saturn with Moloch in the following way. Sikkoth is a celestial god, recognized from the

453
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:08,200
on-god list discovered at Ugarit, originally sourced from Nippur and various Mesopotamian

454
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:16,120
origins. Here, it's represented as Ninerta, who is the principal deity in Mesopotamian culture

455
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:22,440
that is associated with this planet Saturn, and also acknowledged in the West and occasionally

456
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:29,400
equated with the god Horon, a god worshiped by the Samaritans. The name Sikkoth in Amos

457
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:37,080
precisely echoes this star god's name. Its title being Melch, or king, suggests the deity's prominent

458
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:43,240
status. It becomes the god Moloch in the biblical text. This indicates that Sikkoth holds the highest

459
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:52,120
significance in the ritual mentioned by Amos. Meanwhile, Chion correlates with the Akkadian term

460
00:55:52,200 --> 00:56:00,520
Kajmanu, denoting the steadfast, the steady one, which is a reference to the star god Horon,

461
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:06,280
who is also equated with Sikkoth, is considered one of the most attested deities of the ancient

462
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:12,520
sources who shows up in text from the southernmost ends of Egypt all the way up to Turkey. He is

463
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:20,920
considered a god of healing, drugs, magic, forbidden knowledge, and doom. A possible forerunner to the

464
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:28,360
serpent in the garden, adding yet another layer of ancient deities that get polemicized in the

465
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:35,560
biblical text. In the Hebrew scriptures, Moloch is depicted as a foreign god who occasionally found

466
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:42,680
a foothold in Israel's religious practices due to the adoption of synchronistic beliefs by some

467
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:50,280
of the unfaithful kings. The divine commandments given to Moses explicitly prohibited the Jews

468
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:56,840
from engaging in the practices of the Egyptians or Canaanites. The edict stated,

469
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:05,000
you shall not sacrifice any of your children in fire to Moloch, thereby defiling the name of your

470
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:15,160
god, Leviticus 1821. Yet it is documented that influence kings like Ahaz and 2 Kings 16 and

471
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:25,960
Manessa, 2 Kings 21, under Assyrian sway, paid homage to Moloch at Tofeth, a hilly area just

472
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:33,880
outside Jerusalem. While this site thrived under the leadership of Manesh's son, King Omnon, it was

473
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:41,400
eradicated during King Josiah's rule, who was known for his religious reforms. He is quoted,

474
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:48,280
he desecrated Tofeth in the valley of Benhenom, so no one could use it to sacrifice their son or

475
00:57:48,280 --> 00:58:05,960
daughter in the fire to Moloch, 2 Kings 2310. In Canaanite tales, two mountains,

476
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:15,080
Targitzi and Therimagi, support the sky and enclose the terrestrial ocean. W. F. Albright

477
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:20,600
suggests that the term El Shaddai stems from a Semitic origin found in the cating words

478
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:28,760
Shadu, meaning mountain, and Shadau, translating as mountain dweller. This associates with one of

479
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:37,320
the Amurus names. Philo of Biblos also claims that Atlas was an Elohim, just as he is a Titan

480
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:42,840
in the Greek text, aligning with El Shaddai's mountain god interpretation. Harriet Lutzky

481
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:51,160
offers another viewpoint, linking Shaddai with the Hebrew word sad, meaning breast. This suggests

482
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:57,320
a connection with the Semitic goddess, posits the twin mountains as symbolic breasts of the earth,

483
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:05,480
dual mountain themes are recurrent in Canaanite lore, similar to Horib and Sinai from the Bible.

484
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:10,280
Their religious beliefs of the Canaanites were shaped by their geographical location,

485
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:16,920
nestled between Egypt and Mesopotamia. These neighboring regions significantly impacted

486
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:24,280
Canaanite spirituality. For instance, during the role of the chariot rhyoning Mariano in

487
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:33,480
Egypt's Hyksos era, Baal began to be linked with the Egyptian deity Set, especially Set's Setaka form.

488
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:41,160
From that point on, Baal's depictions included the crown of lower Egypt and a distinct Egyptian

489
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:49,640
posture. Likewise, deities like Athoret, later known as Ashura and Anat, started being illustrated

490
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:56,360
with Egyptian wigs reminiscent of Hathor or Isis. From another perspective,

491
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:03,720
Jean Batarro proposed that Yah of Ebla, potentially a precursor to Yam,

492
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:12,120
god of the sea, was aligned with the Mesopotamian god Ia during the rule of the Akkadian empire.

493
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:16,200
The Canaanite faith in the middle and late Bronze Age

494
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:24,760
showed evident influences from the Hurrians and Mitonites. The Hurrian goddess Hibat found devotees

495
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:32,520
in Jerusalem, while Baal was often equated with the Hurrian storm deity Teshub and Hittite storm god

496
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:40,600
Tarhunt. When compared to the neighboring Eastern Arameans, the nature and roles of Canaanite gods

497
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:49,240
seemed remarkably similar. Early Amorite invaders of Mesopotamia previously recognized deities like

498
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:55,560
Baal Haddad and El. Phoenician sailors spread Canaanite religious beliefs to the west,

499
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:03,080
leaving imprints on Greek mythology. This can be seen in the division of power among the

500
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:13,400
Olympian gods Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. Reflecting Hittite, Canaanites, Syrian divisions among Baal,

501
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:20,760
Yam, Moth, or Marduk, and Nenerta. Additionally, Hercules labors echo the tales of the Tyrian

502
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:33,080
Melkhart, who was frequently likened to Hercules. If we bring our attention back to the Elephantine

503
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:41,080
Jews living in Egypt in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE, we notice that Judaism at this time is still

504
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:50,360
polytheistic. The majority of the Aramaic fragments show either Jov, Yahu, or Kunum as the major head

505
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:57,720
of the pantheon, but some, like this Aramaic text, Carpentra Stella says,

506
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:28,440
In the top part of the stele, the Egyptian god of the underworld, Osiris sits on the throne,

507
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:36,280
recognizable with his characteristic crook and flail. Behind him is a goddess dressed in a long

508
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:43,320
skirt, could be Isis or Moth. The table, a lady perhaps, the deceased stands with her arms raised,

509
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:50,360
an adoration pose. In the lower image, the deceased is shown lying on a lying bed.

510
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:58,760
The embalming god Anubis is shown, assisted by the falcon god Horus. The four canopic jugs with

511
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:04,840
the entrails of the deceased are under the bed, with lids likely designed as heads of the four

512
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:15,000
sons of Horus. Emsit, Hopi, Duomatef, Kebehessenuf, Nephthys kneels at the feet of the dead, and Isis

513
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:28,200
is shown at the head. What happened? How is it that when we get to the time of Ptolemy II,

514
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:35,160
the creation of the Septuagint, that we all of a sudden had the monotheistic approach to theology

515
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:43,320
from these Israelites? I think the answer to this question is very simple. The popular philosophy

516
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:51,960
of any given time period is going to dramatically affect the theology of that period. For example,

517
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:59,400
we see how much the Stoics and Epicureans influenced the Middle Platonist, who in turn

518
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:04,280
influenced Christian theologians and church fathers of the second century.

519
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:08,840
But what about the third century BCE? At the time when the Pentateuch was being put together,

520
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:15,800
Platonism was on the rise, along with Aristotle's School of the Peripatetic and the skepticism of

521
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:21,160
Pyrrho. These philosophers, with the resources of the Great Library of Alexandria,

522
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:28,840
with access to thinkers like Zoraster, the Magian, and Heraclitus, some of the earliest thinkers

523
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:36,120
to exhibit monotheistic or skeptic tendencies against the dogmas and superstitions of the day.

524
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:43,640
Initiation here into the ancient mysteries so honored among men mocks holiness.

525
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:50,440
They raised their voices at stone idols as a man might argue with his doorpost.

526
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:53,320
They have understood so little of the gods.

527
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:05,320
Thales was the first master of the School of Athens. He was known for traveling to see the

528
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:10,680
greatest minds of his day in Egypt and Babylon. He taught that water was the first principle,

529
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:19,400
archaic, in which life can spring from. Thales believed in an uncreated being who crafts

530
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:26,840
fuses, nature, which all things are from. In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

531
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:32,280
Now the earth was formless and empty. Darkness was over the surface of the deep,

532
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:39,000
and the spirit of God was hovering over the waters. Notice how water is the first thing that

533
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:45,000
is formed. This is in line with the philosophical thinking of Thales in the School of Athens,

534
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:51,000
and is also possible of the Egyptian sages or Magile Xoraster, believed in something similar.

535
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,560
Heraclitus describes Thales as a Phoenician by remote descent.

536
01:05:56,600 --> 01:06:03,480
When Thales died, Anaximander became the second master, who was said to be the teacher of Pythagoras,

537
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:09,800
who brought these teachings to Italy. Anaximander is the earliest use of the word

538
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:18,040
eperion, or infinite, limitless, to designate the original first principle of the cosmos, uncreated,

539
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:24,120
beginning of all things. The first philosopher to employ in philosophical context, the term

540
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:30,040
archae, which until then had meant beginning or origin. Anaximander called this something by the

541
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:37,160
name fousis or nature. Next after him was Anaximinis, third master of the School of Athens, from the

542
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:44,920
Melesian school, who was a material monist, who sought to discover the archae, the beginning or

543
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:53,160
origin, the one underlying basis of all things. Anaximinis also believed that air was divine.

544
01:06:54,120 --> 01:07:01,240
He identified air with the breath of life, and thus the soul as well as the air and the atmosphere.

545
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:09,240
Only a single sentence long quote by Anaximinis arrives, just as our soul, being air,

546
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:16,360
holds us together, so Numa and air encompass and guard the whole world.

547
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:25,320
This is the first extant source to use the word Numa or breath. Genesis 2.7 says,

548
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:33,160
the Lord God formed man from dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life,

549
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:43,800
the Numa, and the man became a living being. Genesis lines up perfectly with the philosophy

550
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:56,280
of the Presocratics. After Anaximinis you get Heraclitus, who claims to announce an everlasting

551
01:07:56,280 --> 01:08:04,040
logos or word, according to which all things are one in some sense. Opposites are necessary for life,

552
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:11,160
but they are unified in a system of balanced exchanges. The world itself consists of a law-like

553
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:18,280
interchange of elements symbolized by fire, and Anaximinis is criticized by Parminides,

554
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:25,080
who starts the School of the Eliatics. He is called the Father of Logic. It is during this time

555
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:34,680
that superstitions and dogmas are being challenged. Anaxagoras would be the next master, Vathens,

556
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:39,400
and his innovative theory of physical nature is encapsulated in the phrase,

557
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:46,280
a portion of everything in everything. Its primary expression is found in the following

558
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:52,600
difficult fragment, and since the portions of both the large and the small are equal in amount,

559
01:08:53,400 --> 01:09:00,440
in this way too all things would be in everything, nor can they be separate, but all things have a

560
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:06,200
portion of everything. Since there cannot be as smallest, nothing can be separated or come to

561
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:12,920
be by itself, but as in the beginning now too all things are together, but in all things there are

562
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:19,640
many things equal in amount both in the larger and the smaller of things being separated off.

563
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:28,040
God is one, is also a phrase that is attributed to him, who in response to the challenges imposed

564
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:34,680
by the competing schools of Parminides and Empedocles is able to unify the leading theories of

565
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:42,120
the day. Anaxagoras introduced the concept of the noose, or the cosmic mind, as an ordering force,

566
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:50,440
and one of his students would be Archelaus, the next master of the school, who was also at this

567
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:57,720
time a staunch skeptic and natural philosopher. He is the one who teaches Socrates, and Socrates

568
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:03,240
is the teacher of Plato. Plato would be the one to unify the entire base of knowledge that Athens

569
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:09,400
had been accumulating from the world for the past 200 years and bring them into his dialogues

570
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:13,560
through the character of Socrates, who was his teacher.

571
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:27,560
Plato wrote a dialogue called Timaeus, an exposition of cosmology in which the Demiurge,

572
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:34,680
the agent who takes the pre-existing materials of chaos, arranges them according to the models

573
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:42,200
of eternal forms, produces all physical things of the world, including human bodies. The Demiurge,

574
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:49,480
or the craftsman, if you want to say that, is sometimes thought of as the platonic personification

575
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:57,000
of active reason. What is so striking about this is that the Demiurge is the craftsman of the universe

576
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:06,040
like Yahweh or Ptah or El in the Ugritic text. He is the uncorated creator of the gods and humans

577
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:13,800
alike. Plato's idea of the cosmos is identical to what is taught in Judeo-Christian cosmology

578
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:21,480
in the time when the Pentateuch is put together. Plato, like his predecessors, were challenging

579
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:28,200
the dogmas and superstitions of his day, and he even sought to replace Homer and Hesiod,

580
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:35,480
the two most famous poets of ancient Greece, where most religious ideas of the day

581
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:43,880
are found in the stories about their gods. For instance, take Plato in Republic Book 3

582
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:50,200
through the mouth of Socrates says, There was another motive in purifying religion.

583
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:57,880
Which is to banish fear. For no man can be courageous, who is afraid of death,

584
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:02,520
who believes the tales, which are repeated by the poets concerning the world below.

585
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:12,600
They must be gently requested not to abuse hell or Hades. They may be reminded that their stories

586
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:20,440
are both untrue and discouraging. Nor must they be angry if we expunge obnoxious passages,

587
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:27,960
such as the depressing words of Achilles. I would rather be serving man than rule over the dead.

588
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:35,560
In the verses which tell of the squalid mansions, the senseless shadows, the fitting soul mourning

589
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:42,840
over lost strength and youth, the soul with a gibber going beneath the earth like smoke,

590
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:49,640
or the souls of the suitors which flutter about like bats, the terrors and horrors

591
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:57,720
of cockatice and sticks, ghost and shapeless shades, and the rest of their tartarian nomenclature

592
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:04,520
must vanish. Such tales may have their use, but they are not the proper food for soldiers,

593
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:12,440
as little can we admit the sorrows and sympathies of the Homeric heroes, Achilles the son of Thetis,

594
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:18,440
in tears, throwing ashes on his head, or pacing up and down the seashore in distraction.

595
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:26,840
Or Priam, the cousin of the gods, crying aloud, rolling in the mire. A good man is not prostrated

596
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:33,640
at the loss of children or fortune, neither is death terrible to him, and therefore lamentations

597
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:39,400
over the dead should not be practiced by men of note, they should be the concern of inferior

598
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:46,440
persons only, whether women or men. Still worst is the attribution of such weakness to the gods,

599
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:53,400
as when the goddess say, a loss may travail, and the worst of all, when the king of heaven himself

600
01:13:53,400 --> 01:14:00,200
laments in the inability to save Hector, or sorrows over the impending doom of his dear Sarpadam.

601
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:07,400
Such a character of God is not ridiculed by our young men, is likely to be imitated by them,

602
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:13,400
nor should our citizens be given the excess laughter. Such violent delights are followed

603
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:19,640
by violent reaction. The description in the Iliad of the gods, shaking their sides at their

604
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:26,360
clumsiness of Hephaestus, will not be admitted by us, certainly not.

605
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:40,920
Plato is clearly not satisfied with the pagan religions of his day, and wants to replace it

606
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:48,920
with a more up-to-date or mature theology, with a perfect god who has no mistakes and is never

607
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:55,800
depicted doing anything that we can look at as weak. Plato says, let us declare then for what

608
01:14:55,800 --> 01:15:05,160
caused nature, and this all was framed by him that framed it. He was good, and in none that is good

609
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:12,280
can there arise jealousy of ought at any time. So being far aloof from this, he desired that all

610
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:19,720
things should be as like unto himself as possible. This is that the most sovereign cause of nature

611
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:25,640
in the universe, which we shall most surely be right in accepting from men of understanding,

612
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:31,560
for God desiring that all things should be good, and that so far as this might be,

613
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:37,080
there should be not evil having received all that is visible, not in a state of rest,

614
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:42,520
but moving without harmony or measure, brought it from its disorder into order,

615
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:49,560
thinking that this was all in ways better than the other. And Plato continues,

616
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:56,680
in the forming the universe, he curated reason in soul and soul and body, that he might be the

617
01:15:56,680 --> 01:16:04,360
maker of a work that was by nature the most fair and perfect. In this way then, we ought to affirm

618
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:11,640
according to probable account that this universe is a living creature and very truth possessing soul

619
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:14,520
and reason by the providence of God.

620
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:28,200
Plato also rejected Athenian democracy in favor of a republic guided by a priesthood

621
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:34,760
and a philosopher king, whose laws were given by the gods and are the most ancient and holy.

622
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:42,680
He rejected even things he once said were great before, such as the Dionysian mysteries of love

623
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:50,520
and passion, which he now argues in his last work are empty pleasures. For instance, in his last work

624
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:57,880
On Laws, 636b, these common meals, for example, and these gymnasia,

625
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:03,000
while they are at present beneficial to the states and many other respects,

626
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:11,640
yet in the event of civil strife, they prove dangerous. And moreover, this institution,

627
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:17,640
one of old standing, is thought to have corrupted the pleasures of love which are natural not to

628
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:25,080
men, but also natural to beast. For this, your states are held primarily responsible

629
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:30,200
and along with them all others that are especially encouraged the use of the gymnasia.

630
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:36,200
And whether one makes the observation in earnest or in jests, one certainly should not fail to

631
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:42,280
observe that when a male unites with female for the procreation, the pleasure, experience is held

632
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:49,400
to be due to nature, but contrary to nature, when male mates with male or female with female,

633
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:55,400
and that those first guilty of such enormities were impelled by their slavery to pleasure.

634
01:17:56,280 --> 01:18:05,400
And we all accuse the Cretans of concocting the story about Ganymede to justify unnatural pleasures.

635
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:09,800
In case you didn't know, Ganymede was the boy lover of Zeus.

636
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:17,240
When we look at this, in context to the story of Maccabees, you see the laws enacted and followed

637
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:23,480
by none other than the Maccabee dynasty, who revolts against the Greek pagan king Antiochus

638
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:31,080
IV for putting a gymnasium in Jerusalem, which they called an abomination. Looks like Judas

639
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:37,320
Maccabees and Plato believe the same thing about gymnasiums. I also think there is clear ties to

640
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:43,960
ancient Babylon, Assyrian and Sumerian laws, stories woven in the text. These are in no doubt in my

641
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:50,600
mind authentic and ancient Near Eastern texts that the Greeks inherit from the Jews. For example,

642
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:56,760
Deuteronomy, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, is clearly an ancient law that we see present

643
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:03,480
in Hammurabi's code. As Plato said in the Republic, though, for people to respect the laws,

644
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:10,280
they need to be the most ancient and given by the gods from the oldest times. But I also think

645
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:17,720
there is no reason to believe that the philosophers and scribes of Alexandria, like Demetrius Filarium,

646
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:21,640
did not have any oversight over what was written and edited.

647
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:36,200
What solid evidence do we have that Platonism has any influence on Judaism? If we continue down our

648
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:42,680
line of masters, schools, methods, as I trace the roots of Thales down to Plato,

649
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:48,600
the next three school masters after Plato is Aristotle, who, after the conquest of Alexander

650
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:55,880
the Great, is sent into exile by the Ellusinian priest, who charged Aristotle with blasphemy

651
01:19:55,880 --> 01:20:03,400
against the gods, and Aristotle is replaced by Theophrastus, who was also charged by the Athenian

652
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:09,560
religious leaders with blasphemy against the gods. Now keep in mind, all of this is happening after

653
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:15,480
Socrates. What is happening with these masters of Athens being at odds with the religious leaders

654
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:21,160
of the priests of the Ellusinians? They're obviously challenging the dogmas and superstitions.

655
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:29,240
Now Theophrastus was the student and new master of the school who taught Demetrius Filarium.

656
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:36,360
Demetrius Filarium was also exiled, and he moves to Alexandria with Pierrot the Skeptic

657
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:43,640
after traveling the world with Alexander the Great, meeting Brahmins and Magi and living

658
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:49,880
amongst the Chaldeans and Babylon, and they went down to the court of Ptolemy and Alexandria

659
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:57,400
to help build the library. According to multiple sources, Demetrius Filarium was trying to collect

660
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:03,240
all the books in the inhabitable world and was commissioned by Ptolemy to translate the laws

661
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:10,760
of the Jews into Greek. In my personal opinion, it is at this time when the Pentateuch is put

662
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:17,960
together in its current monotheistic form, with influences from the Platonist of the time period.

663
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:26,360
You see, we have a direct line from Thales the Presocratics all the way down to Plato

664
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:36,600
and then continuing down to Demetrius who moves to Alexandria Egypt and creates the Pentateuch.

665
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:44,920
Here's what Josephus says about this. When Alexander had reigned 12 years and after him

666
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:50,360
Ptolemy sought her 40 years, Philadelphius then took the kingdom of Egypt and held it 40 years

667
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:57,800
within one. He procured the law to be interpreted and set free those who come from Jerusalem into

668
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:06,200
Egypt and were in slavery there, who were 120,000. The occasion was this. Demetrius Filarius,

669
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:12,360
who was library keeper to the king, was now endeavoring, if it were possible, to gather

670
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:18,440
together all the books that were in the inhabitable earth. And buying whatsoever was anywhere valuable

671
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:24,360
or agreeable to the king's inclination, which inclination of his Demetrius was zealously subservient.

672
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:30,440
And when once Ptolemy asked him how many tens of thousands of books he had collected, he replied

673
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:37,400
that he already had 20 times 10,000, but that in a little time he should have 50 times 10,000.

674
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:44,440
But be said, he had been informed that there are many books of the laws among the Jews worthy

675
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:50,440
of inquiring for and worthy of the king's library, but which, being written of characters and in

676
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:56,120
dialect of their own, will cause no small pains in getting them translated into the Greek tongue,

677
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:59,960
that the character in which they are written seems to be like that which is proper to the

678
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:05,720
character of the Syrians, and that its sound when pronounced is like theirs also, and that this sound

679
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:12,120
appears to be peculiar to themselves, wherefore he said that nothing hindered why they might not get

680
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:17,080
those books to be translated also. For while nothing is wanting that is necessary for that

681
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:23,240
purpose, we may have their books also in this library. So the king thought that Demetrius was

682
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:28,120
very zealous to procure him an abundance of books, and that he suggested that this was exceeding

683
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:33,880
proper for him to do, and therefore he wrote to the Jewish high priest that he should act accordingly.

684
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:41,160
Demetrius wrote in a letter, It is not fit for us, O king, to overlook things hastily

685
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:47,800
or to deceive ourselves, but to lay the truth open, for since we have determined not only to get

686
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:54,280
the laws of the Jews transcribed, but interpreted also, for thy satisfaction, by what means can we

687
01:23:54,280 --> 01:24:00,280
do this, while so many of the Jews are now slaves in thy kingdom. For both these people, and we also

688
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:07,960
worship the same God, the framer of all things, we call him, and that truly by the Greek Xena,

689
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:15,240
or Jupiter, because he breathes life into all men, wherefore do thou restore these men

690
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:22,440
to their own country, and that this do the honor of God, because these men pay a peculiar excellent

691
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:28,440
worship to him. Known as how Demetrius is already comparing his framer of all things,

692
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:34,280
the divine craftsman or demiurge, who he was most likely comparing to Yahweh in order to

693
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:41,400
unify this God with Jupiter. Keep in mind, less than a century before this, the fragments of the

694
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:50,360
Jewish communities that we have are still polytheistic. We have a direct line from the masters of the

695
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:57,960
Athens Academy, from Thales all the way down to Demetrius, who is writing this letter to the Jews,

696
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:04,680
who is the face of the creation of the Pentateuch. I think there is more than enough evidence to

697
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:10,600
lay this argument out, that this is the beginning of the trend of monotheism, and at this time,

698
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:16,920
the priestshoods of Yahweh and El, synced with that of the craftsmen and demiurgic

699
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:24,360
creator gods of Egypt and Greece, Yahweh of the Elohim, and the God who has its roots all over

700
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:32,200
Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean world, such as Kronos, El, Pita, Yahweh, or Zeus, or Amen Ra.

701
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:39,960
The so-called pagans that lived after this time period also adopt the same monist trends

702
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:47,960
the Judeo-Christians adopt. The soul-invictus religion would come from that and the neoplateness

703
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:55,960
philosophers and theurgists were no exception to this. The Chaldean oracles also show a

704
01:25:56,760 --> 01:26:03,960
one who is above all gods. The philosophy of the time, Platonism to Middle Platonism,

705
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:10,280
and eventually Neoplatonism, would continue to influence the theology of whatever time matched it.

706
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:23,880
I'll leave you with this. In a text from Plutarch called Moralia, he says,

707
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:32,440
moreover, most people believe that Amon is the name given to Zeus in the land of the Egyptians,

708
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:41,880
a name which we, with a slight alteration, pronounce Amon. But Menitho of Seventus thinks that the

709
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:50,600
meaning concealed or concealment lies in this word. Hecateus of Abdera says that the Egyptians

710
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:57,000
use the expression one to another whenever they call to anyone. For the word is a form of address

711
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:04,680
when they therefore address the supreme god whom they believe to be the same as the universe as

712
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:12,680
if he were invisible, concealed, and implore him to make visible himself and manifest to them.

713
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:19,720
They use the word Amen. So great then was the circumspection of the Egyptians and their wisdom

714
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:25,320
touching all that had to do with the gods. Plutarch is proposing that the term Amen

715
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:34,520
is a shout or chant that is used to call on any of the gods, not just Amon, but any of the gods

716
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:42,200
including the supreme invisible one. He also cites Hecateus of Abdera for this very idea. And it

717
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:50,680
turns out the Hecateus of Abdera is the oldest fragment that we have, citation of Moses outside

718
01:27:50,680 --> 01:28:03,640
of the Hebrew Bible. Let me know what you guys think about this stuff. Leave it in the comments,
