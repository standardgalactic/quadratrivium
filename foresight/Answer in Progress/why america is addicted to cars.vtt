WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
My heart is breaking.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Thank you! We got one!

00:04.000 --> 00:10.000
I love public transit because it's great for the environment, it's good for communities and for public health.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
And not because I suck at driving.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
But not everybody feels that way.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
And even if people do support public transit, even if they have access to it, they still might not choose to use it.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
And I want to figure out why.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
So I spent the last few weeks looking at maps, talking to people,

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
and exploring one of Canada's most cursed public transit projects to figure it out.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
This place is so empty, it's like something from a zombie film.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
It's a long story, let me explain.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
Thank you to our supporters on Patreon for supporting the channel,

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
and to No Brainers for sponsoring this portion of the video.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
Just like us, the team at No Brainers are a group of non-experts asking questions big and small,

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
and sharing the fun along the way.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
Produced in partnership with TVO, they explore things like beauty brainwashing to endless scrolling.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Are we really in control of how makeup makes us feel?

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
What happens when you overstimulate your brain with a full day of mindless scrolling,

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
and then hit the brakes by jumping into a sensory deprivation tank?

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
All of it is available right now for free on YouTube.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
If you like us, then you'll like them.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Their channel is linked in the description. Check them out.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Now back to the video.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
I have always been a fan of public transit.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
For all of the frustrations and faults, I think that it's a good thing.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
Which is why it's so strange to me that Canada and America seem so different from our global peers.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
Like, you look at the girl group of seven and you can't help but notice that we are just so far behind

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
in terms of infrastructure, but also user interest.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
If we compare the amount of passenger cars per capita, Canadians and Americans just seem to prefer driving.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
And I want to know why.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
So to start, I think I need to find the facts in my feelings

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
and figure out if public transit is actually a good thing.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
Is it something nice to have, or do we even need it?

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Yes, we do.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
So I tried to make a public transit pros and cons list for society.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
And it was really hard because there are, like, no cons.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
You know that TikTok audio?

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
Cosy economy benefits everybody, hurts nobody.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Yes, that is public transit.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
It is safer and less fatal for riders and other street users than cars.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
It encourages regular exercise.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
It is way better for the environment.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.000
It is also a way more efficient use of space because cars suck at maximizing the amount of people getting from point A to point B

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
and storing them is a nightmare.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
It is also essential for people who do not have access to a car and need to get places.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
But if you don't care about any of that and you just care about money, public transit is a good investment.

02:32.000 --> 02:39.000
So if public transit is this great for society, why doesn't Canada and America have more of it?

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Have you heard about the highway lobby?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Good job!

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Now we weren't always bad at public transit.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
In the early 1900s, vast rail networks connected the continent and streetcar systems weaved through cities

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
that you wouldn't traditionally consider hubs, like LA.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
So what happened?

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
Well, it starts with the concept of a street which has surprisingly many uses.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
A path, a playground, a potential profit.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
That's because when a street belongs to everyone, everyone is free to imagine how they can use it.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
It asks a question.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
What am I for?

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
Believe it or not, in the early 1900s, we didn't have a clear answer.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
But the rising popularity of cars was making it pretty obvious that we needed to find one.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
Cars brought congestion, which made a lot of public transit impractical.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
They also brought danger because they kept hitting people.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
Cars also brought together enough collective interest and influence to finally answer the question.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Streets are for cars.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Now, the highway lobby did do a lot of things to literally pave the way for an auto-centric future.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
They purchased streetcar networks that were failing because of car traffic and they tore up the tracks.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
They established toll-free highways funded largely by federal taxes,

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
and they benefited from racism and classism by promising an urban renewal

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
by replacing marginalized communities with highways.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
But I think the most significant thing that the highway lobby might have pulled off

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
was that they got us to stop imagining.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
What are streets for?

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Through flashy exhibits and promises of modernity and freedom,

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
we allowed cars to take over the street, and in doing so,

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
changed the way we approach everything.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Solving congestion went from moving people to moving cars.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
Reducing traffic accidents went from saving lives to getting pedestrians out of the way.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
Cities went from dense hubs of community and trade to parking lots,

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
and people left to spend too much of their life in rush hour traffic.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
But to say that cars have just won forever would be a disservice to the many public transit projects

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
happening in Canada and North America.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
Like Toronto, the city that I'm from, has some of the most public transit projects in North America.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
Except the only time that I hear about them is when things go wrong.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
And after learning what we've learned, I can't help but wonder,

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
is this the highway lobby?

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Are they doing something behind the scenes?

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
So I read a few articles, talked to some people, and it turns out, probably not sabotage.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
But mostly, it's just a miracle that any public transit works.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
I'm Reese. I'm, I guess, primarily a YouTuber at RM Transit,

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
and it's the same on Twitter, Instagram, all the socials that I also do transportation consulting.

05:12.000 --> 05:19.000
So in general, there are a variety of steps to planning a new big infrastructure transit project like this.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
You start with a good reason to build such a project, and then you move on to sort of planning.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
And with planning, you're looking at all kinds of different things.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
You know, you might have kind of a map of your city.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
Then you start trying to say, like, oh, how can we connect these things up and hit the necessary destinations?

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
There's all kinds of different geographical dependencies as well.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
There might be a sewer line here, and you might have to figure out a way to go under it.

05:43.000 --> 05:49.000
Once you go through the planning process, you're probably going to start going into engineering.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
You're going to look at the actual physical built environment.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
So maybe there's a mall and you got to send the train under the mall.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
Now you got to look at the foundations of the mall to make sure that you can actually dig a tunnel there

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
and that you're not going to cause the mall to collapse.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Once you have that, you're going to cost it out.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
How many years is it probably going to take to build the thing?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
What materials do we need?

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
What equipment do we need to buy so that we can now go and build this thing?

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
And once we have the costing, then we can go to government.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
Everyone's favorite. And ask, please give me money.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
If a project gets funded, then it moves to procurement, where different companies bid for contracts

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
to actually dig the holes and lay down lines.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
Once you figure out who's built and what, you actually have to build it, which means...

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
You close down streets. You reroute buses.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
There's tons of different planning and organization that has to happen in that.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
And then once everything is built, you need to test it.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
And it's not just seeing if a vehicle can move.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
It's about the systems in and around it.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
And then it finally opens. And we're done. Right? Wrong.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
You've got vehicles, but you also have things like the tracks and the overhead wires

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
and the tunnels themselves that need to be checked up on a regular basis.

07:01.000 --> 07:08.000
There are literally millions of components and thousands of sort of electronic devices that all need to be maintained.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
And there's usually very little time to do this since these things start early and run late.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
So if something goes wrong, like a flood or an electrical fire, everything else gets delayed.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
There's sort of this avalanche of dependencies where you have,

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
oh, we were going to go fix the rails, but now we got to go fix the trains.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
So the rails got to get fixed in two weeks, but that means we've got to fix something else later.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
But so far, this has been really rail-focused.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
What about buses and other forms of sustainable transit?

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
They're cheaper and they're less disruptive to build and repair.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
The issue here is that, as with everything in transportation, you get into trade-offs.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
When you have buses and rail, one of them is a bit more resilient and easy to manage,

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
but it's way more expensive to run buses if you want to move thousands and thousands of people.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
Because if you want to move a thousand people, you need like 12 buses, but you need one train.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
And that's 12 drivers versus one driver.

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
So sometimes it makes more sense to commission a bus, other times a multi-use trail, other times trains.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
I like trains.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
It all really depends on what a community needs.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
Now, this means that things go wrong when the people involved in these projects forget about the community

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
or actively want to displace them.

08:12.000 --> 08:20.000
But this conversation also made me realize that sometimes things go wrong because this is just really hard.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Deadlines are missed even when people don't want to miss deadlines.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
Sometimes maintenance is at an inconvenient time because there was a fire.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
There wasn't supposed to be a fire, but there was one and we had to put it out.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
My conversation with Reese at least gave me a little bit more sympathy for how hard all of this is.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
If you like nuanced but optimistic news around public transit, you should really check out his channel.

08:39.000 --> 08:47.000
But either way, at least we know that as much work as it is to make public transit, when we do it, people are gonna use it.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Right?

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Right?

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Welcome to the 401 in Toronto, Canada.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
It is the busiest highway in North America.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
And apparently it does give us an odd sense of pride.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Does it, Kyle? Does it, Kyle?

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
There's so many cars.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
There's a lot of cars.

09:09.000 --> 09:16.000
And I just find this kind of surprising because according to census data, there are a lot of people driving in and out of Toronto who don't need to.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
The rail service I'm riding right now connects these suburbs to the downtown core.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
If we compare the average commuter travel times, public transit should be the obvious choice every time.

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
Yet 91% of people commuting to Toronto still choose to drive rather than take public transit.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
This is a larger disparity than usual due to the pandemic's many impacts.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
But in 2016, it still wasn't even close.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
So even when public transit is available, there's no guarantee that people will use it.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Why?

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
To answer that question, I needed to figure out what factors influence people to choose how they travel.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
So I picked up some beginner-friendly books on public transit design,

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
fell into the world of urban planning content, and spent a little too long playing mini-metro.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
Yeah, I count this as research. No, I'm not very good at it.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
When it comes to transit modes, we generally have three options.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Public, private, and active.

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
Each of these have pros and cons, not societal ones like I talked about for public transit at the start of this video,

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
but more like potential points of friction that might steer someone from one option to another.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
Because it turns out, individuals aren't always motivated by societal benefits.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Take that, utilitarianism.

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
Now, I could just list these factors, but I could also force my friends to experience them.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Do I have any idea how to drive?

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Yes, I do have a license.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
I have 100% in the theory test if that helps.

10:34.000 --> 10:41.000
I don't need theory, I need practice because I need you guys to do a travel challenge with me.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Okay, so we want to compare different modes of transit.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
If we assume that the average person should be able to comfortably travel

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
between shelter, healthcare, education, and work in a reasonable amount of time,

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
then we can travel between those places and compare the experience and timing with Melissa driving,

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
Taha taking public transit, and me walking.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
Well, I feel like I have a disadvantage in Toronto and you guys have home-field advantage,

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
so I don't really feel like that's a fair fight.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Okay, so what's some neutral territory?

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Oh no, Ottawa?

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
Yes, it's still in Canada and yes, Melissa and I have been there before,

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
but it is so unmemorable that it isn't the problem.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
So I map for locations.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
The hotel we're staying at, a major hospital, the local university, and Parliament Hill.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
Because Answer in Progress is now a political party running on a platform of getting views.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
I don't think that this should be a competition though, right?

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
It's like a learning experience.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
I agree, it should be a competition.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
No, that's-

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
That's what you said and I agree with it.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
This does mean that I'm gonna need to walk like three hours.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
It seems like a personal problem.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I love our supportive work environment.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
For the record, this is your idea.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
You called us and now you're complaining.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
I'm hanging up. Go away, go away!

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Who goes to Ottawa?

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
What do you think of this train?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I like this train, it's nice.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I like trains.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
This is my baby's first vlog in public.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Well, I have to walk, so I'm leaving now.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Time starts 2.18.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Goodbye everybody.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
He's leaving.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
I've got to drive, so I gotta go get a car.

12:14.000 --> 12:22.000
I am taking public transit and I don't know anything about the public transit system in Ottawa.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
So I am going to figure that out.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Here we go.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
I could get there 15 minutes driving or one hour and 11 minutes walking.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
I'm calling my shot and assuming I'm walking in the right direction.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
That's my ride.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
The farthest thing away is currently the hospital.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Maybe 20 minutes.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
That doesn't seem too bad.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
Hello, welcome to my public transit tier list.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
I couldn't figure out OBS, so we're doing this instead.

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
We're going to be ranking our modes of transit according to five categories that I'm going to dramatically reveal with time.

12:52.000 --> 12:58.000
Each one of these represent a potential point of friction that can influence whether or not somebody chooses to walk, drive or take public transit.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
So let's start with understanding.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Understand.

13:01.000 --> 13:08.000
It's important to know that there isn't anything inherently more straightforward about walking, driving or taking public transit in a new place.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
I'm definitely walking in the wrong direction.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Cool.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Love that for me.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
I'm being discriminated against for being British.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
My 4G is not working and the Wi-Fi at the hotel is being mean.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Alright.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
No, boy, no.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Is that a road closure?

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
We can't get a road closure already.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Oh, wait, no.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Am I supposed to go straight?

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
No, it says buses except I can't go straight.

13:32.000 --> 13:37.000
But even though our modes of transit can be equally complicated, the consequences of not understanding can vary.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
Like with walking, it's a little bit embarrassing, but you can get back on track pretty easily.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Hi there.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
This is South, right?

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Amazing.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Thank you so much.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
It also isn't that bad for driving because of GPS.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
Things just get a little tricky when other drivers are involved.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
Can I turn right on red?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
I'm not sure if I can do that.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Not a lot.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Oh, there's cars behind me that are going to get mad.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
But with public transit, there is just so much that you need to understand.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Like if there's a way to get to where you need to go.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
40 minutes to get to the hospital.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
What do you need to take to get there?

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
I can't really tell whether or not like a route is a bus or the tube.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
It just sort of says like this line or this number.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
So that's confusing.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Where is the nearest stop?

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
The confederation line is what I'm looking for, but I don't actually know where I can find it.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
I think it's just in here.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
I'm not sure though.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
This place is so empty.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
It's like something from a zombie film.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
How do you pay?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
By a single day pass.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
So one day it is from credit.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Yes, I would like a receipt.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Day pass and then receipts.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Cool.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
Try to take the confederation line to Blair three stops.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
And are you actually getting on the right thing?

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
I am on the wrong side of the platform.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
Miss any of that up and you are in for a bad time.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
And that bad time is really common.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
Every New Yorker has not paid attention.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Miss their stop.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
Gone over the bridge and then had to go all the way back around.

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
And we've been testing and designing new maps for the entire New York City metropolitan area.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
And just trying to make it easier for everyone to get around the city.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
Now we know that making and maintaining a transit system is really difficult.

15:10.000 --> 15:16.000
But it turns out that communicating that system so that the public understands is also really tricky.

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
While the subway diagram is meant to really guide you while you're underground.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
When you get off at a station what landmarks are you near?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
What direction am I facing?

15:25.000 --> 15:32.000
It becomes really evident when there's not been sufficient thought like gone into these signs.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
Because a lot of it is physical signage.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
It's so empty that I feel like I'm like trespassing.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
I might be.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
I don't know enough about this area.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
A lot of times it does end up being like Unicode little emojis.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Trains.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
That's what I want.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
There's so many people from around the world that may not know your language.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
But hey, with enough time and experience you can understand any mode of transit pretty well.

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
However, what those experiences feel like will vary pretty dramatically.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
For example, if you're living in a society that was designed for motor vehicles,

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
walking isn't always a good time.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Walking through a tunnel, it's a little scary.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
No lighting.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
I was just trying to go through a crosswalk and somebody just started driving.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I don't like this.

16:16.000 --> 16:22.000
Truly the only space between me and cars is like four feet.

16:22.000 --> 16:29.000
I'm really starting to realize that just because there's a place I can walk doesn't mean that it's walkable.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
I'm so tired.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
There's the hospital.

16:32.000 --> 16:37.000
The current time is 4.01 pm.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
I made it.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
I wish I could fit a lower tier in frame.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
Anyway, as you could imagine, cars in public transit are a lot more comfortable.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
I wonder how the other two are doing.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
I hope they're okay.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
They're staying warm and dry.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
I sure am because I am in a car.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
I've just reached University of Ottawa, which is fantastic.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
I didn't even realize it was on the road.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Yeah, parking, parking, parking, parking.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
I made it.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
I should take a selfie.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
I'm walking down a street called Industrial Avenue.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
It does not seem good.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
It does not seem promising.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
Like I get that it can be uncomfortable sitting or standing around strangers,

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
but at least you can zone out and do your own thing.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
And I can't really think of anything that is straight-up uncomfortable about driving

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
other than maybe finding a parking spot.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
I must stop. I did a bad parking job.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Is that parking?

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
That's not parking.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
I've made it to the University of Ottawa.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
But that is nothing but small beans compared to walking in a place designed for cars.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
There's nothing to see but highways or suburbs.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Everything is so far apart.

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
And I kept feeling with every sense I had of cars and buses just whooshing by so much faster.

17:45.000 --> 17:51.000
My walking route has literally taken me to a public transit station.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
There are buses.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
There's an LRT, but now I need to walk.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
I hate committing to a bit.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
Y'all are never going to catch me committing to a bit ever again.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
But hey, walking does have one major benefit.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Freedom.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
But really, it might be tiring or inconvenient,

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
but you can walk to a lot of places while enjoying more flexibility to explore

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
than cars or public transit.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Location three, down.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
When you're in a car, you make your destination and to make another pit stop,

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
you really have to figure out where you're going to park your car.

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
If I saw a café or something that I liked on my route,

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
I wouldn't really want to get off the bus because if I get off the bus,

18:32.000 --> 18:37.000
it's now like another like 15 to 20 minutes until the next bus.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
Now, this might not be a fair ranking for public transit

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
because in many cases it can enable more mobility and freedom.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
However, that relies on a system being well designed and reliable.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
Something Ottawa public transit is not.

18:51.000 --> 18:59.000
I have been waiting for about 10 minutes and it said that the bus was going to be 5 minutes away for the last 10 minutes.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
The only thing I can conclude is that the bus is lying.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
Now, we didn't know Ottawa's public transit reputation before we decided to go there,

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
but it turns out it's cursed.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
Ottawa once had an incredible bus rapid transit system with incredible lanes and roads,

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
but the city realized that they could reduce downtown congestion,

19:16.000 --> 19:21.000
lower operating costs and service more people by replacing the buses with trains.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
So they did it badly.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
There's a lot of nuance to this story,

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
but I just want to share the literal train wreck of a timeline.

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
Late 2012, a transit line is approved to replace popular downtown bus routes.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
2013, construction begins.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
2014, a sinkhole opens?

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
But don't worry, doesn't cause too many issues.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
2016, another sinkhole opens?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
This one does cause a lot of issues.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
2018, the project is supposed to be finished by now.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
It isn't. They still reduce bus service though.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
2019, the line is almost done.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
It's just having trouble passing testing standards.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
But that's not a problem if you just change the testing standards.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
They opened the transit line and cut the bus routes it was designed to replace.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
But uh-oh, the trains keep failing.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Maybe testing is important?

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
2020.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
Some of the trains are pulled out of service because their wheels aren't round.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
They should have watched our video to learn how to make a wheel.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
Oh, also parts of the train were falling on the tracks which was stopping other trains.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
That's synergy, baby.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
2021, derailment.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
Still 2021, another derailment.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
Also still 2021, fair increase?

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
The government finally asked, what happened here?

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
This year, the train is stopped for six days because of ice.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
And then again, a few months later for another two days.

20:36.000 --> 20:43.000
Bro, how am I making a video about public transit good and I accidentally put us in a city where public transit bad?

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
Luckily, things are improving, slowly.

20:47.000 --> 20:54.000
Also, when I was on the tube or subway or whatever it is, um, it's quite slow.

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
Yeah, I meant that literally because they need to run the trains more slowly to avoid wear and tear.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
But not all hope is lost.

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
A lot of the systemic issues have been identified and as the line extends it'll get more useful.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
However, a lot of the damage has kind of been done.

21:09.000 --> 21:14.000
I think what's been really difficult for me is how much trust has been eroded

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
and what kind of repair are we going to be able to create?

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
What would it take to bring riders back?

21:21.000 --> 21:27.000
So is it a matter of looking at our fare structure and then other people are saying, well, not really.

21:27.000 --> 21:34.000
Because if I can't get from point A to point B reliably, I would never pay even nothing for it.

21:34.000 --> 21:39.000
So walking and driving are almost always going to get able-bodied people from point A to point B.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
That is not a guarantee with public transit.

21:41.000 --> 21:47.000
Even if there is a route that can theoretically get you there, if you can't trust it to do that, then you won't use it.

21:47.000 --> 21:52.000
You can support public transit in theory, but if you can't use it in practice, why would you?

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
But wait, there's more.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I need to figure out where Parliament Hill is.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
I don't know if it's a real hill or just like a metaphorical hill.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
I see Parliament, there are cars everywhere.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
I think that all of these roads around Parliament are closing.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
I'm going to figure out how to get to the last stop while I'm on the move.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
There's like a proper news reporter.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
The old school vlogger.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
I am right here.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
There's a sign over there that says I can't park anywhere.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
All the roads are closed.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
This is as close as I'm going to get.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Try to get over there.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
I'm being obscured by clouds at the moment.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
We're so close.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
Let's assume that all of these modes of transit can get you to where you need to go.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
How long does that take?

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Good game, good game.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
We made it all at the same time.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
The exact same time.

22:40.000 --> 22:45.000
I had to walk by like a four-lane highway for an hour.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Oh my god.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Walking.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Terrible.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Driving.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
I put it in the middle tier because sometimes it can be fast,

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
but other times the President of the United States might be in town

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
and all of the streets shut down.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Hurt nobody.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
But.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Goodbye vehicle.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Okay, there she is.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
I think I might see somebody.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Who is that?

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
We made it.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
I think you beat me.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
A little bit.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
For all of the trust issues.

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
When public transit works, it works.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
I've been here for so long.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
We should all say what time we arrived.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
One, two, three, four, seven.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
I f***ing hate you guys.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
I have now combined all of our tier lists into one super tier list

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
based off our five points of friction.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
I've added a new access to the tier list system.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
Looking at all of this now, it's becoming really obvious to me

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
that this was really stupid.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
But it does make it really obvious why people don't take public transit

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
and why they take cars instead.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
Because it can be tricky to understand public transit.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
But even if you understand it, can you trust it

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
to take you to all the places you want to go?

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
In Canada and North America, the answer to that question

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
is pretty often no.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
A lot of places are trying, but it's still going to take a while to get there.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
And sure, when public transit works, it is incredible.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
But cars are gloriously mediocre.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
They get you to where you need to go most of the time.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
It's not too bad.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
So for a lot of people, cars are the natural choice.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
90% of the time.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
But what about the other 10%?

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
After making this video, I now know that it isn't reasonable

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
to just expect everyone to take public transit all of the time.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
It isn't always practical.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
And it also requires a lot of trust and humility.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
Like it is humbling, chasing after a bus

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
and seeing it drive off.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
Or worse, getting stranded because the next one is late or cancelled.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
But I still think it's worth the risk.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Because small increases in public transit use

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
can have big social benefits.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
It might even make public transit itself better

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
because it shows that there's demand.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
Demand for better urban design, demand for better climate,

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
demand for streets to belong to people, not just cars.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
If you take anything away from this video,

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
I hope it's the knowledge that public transit,

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
even at its most cursed, most loathed,

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
it can still beat the alternatives from time to time.

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
Which reminds me, I owe Taha Prize.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
Oh. Oh.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
This is terrible.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Yes!
