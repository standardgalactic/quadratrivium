1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
My heart is breaking.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Thank you! We got one!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I love public transit because it's great for the environment, it's good for communities and for public health.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And not because I suck at driving.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
But not everybody feels that way.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And even if people do support public transit, even if they have access to it, they still might not choose to use it.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And I want to figure out why.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So I spent the last few weeks looking at maps, talking to people,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and exploring one of Canada's most cursed public transit projects to figure it out.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This place is so empty, it's like something from a zombie film.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's a long story, let me explain.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Thank you to our supporters on Patreon for supporting the channel,

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and to No Brainers for sponsoring this portion of the video.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Just like us, the team at No Brainers are a group of non-experts asking questions big and small,

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and sharing the fun along the way.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Produced in partnership with TVO, they explore things like beauty brainwashing to endless scrolling.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Are we really in control of how makeup makes us feel?

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What happens when you overstimulate your brain with a full day of mindless scrolling,

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and then hit the brakes by jumping into a sensory deprivation tank?

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
All of it is available right now for free on YouTube.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
If you like us, then you'll like them.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Their channel is linked in the description. Check them out.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Now back to the video.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I have always been a fan of public transit.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
For all of the frustrations and faults, I think that it's a good thing.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Which is why it's so strange to me that Canada and America seem so different from our global peers.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Like, you look at the girl group of seven and you can't help but notice that we are just so far behind

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
in terms of infrastructure, but also user interest.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
If we compare the amount of passenger cars per capita, Canadians and Americans just seem to prefer driving.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And I want to know why.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So to start, I think I need to find the facts in my feelings

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and figure out if public transit is actually a good thing.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Is it something nice to have, or do we even need it?

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes, we do.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So I tried to make a public transit pros and cons list for society.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And it was really hard because there are, like, no cons.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You know that TikTok audio?

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Cosy economy benefits everybody, hurts nobody.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes, that is public transit.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It is safer and less fatal for riders and other street users than cars.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It encourages regular exercise.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It is way better for the environment.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It is also a way more efficient use of space because cars suck at maximizing the amount of people getting from point A to point B

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and storing them is a nightmare.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It is also essential for people who do not have access to a car and need to get places.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But if you don't care about any of that and you just care about money, public transit is a good investment.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So if public transit is this great for society, why doesn't Canada and America have more of it?

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Have you heard about the highway lobby?

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Good job!

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Now we weren't always bad at public transit.

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
In the early 1900s, vast rail networks connected the continent and streetcar systems weaved through cities

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
that you wouldn't traditionally consider hubs, like LA.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So what happened?

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Well, it starts with the concept of a street which has surprisingly many uses.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
A path, a playground, a potential profit.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That's because when a street belongs to everyone, everyone is free to imagine how they can use it.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It asks a question.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What am I for?

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Believe it or not, in the early 1900s, we didn't have a clear answer.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But the rising popularity of cars was making it pretty obvious that we needed to find one.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Cars brought congestion, which made a lot of public transit impractical.

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
They also brought danger because they kept hitting people.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Cars also brought together enough collective interest and influence to finally answer the question.

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Streets are for cars.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Now, the highway lobby did do a lot of things to literally pave the way for an auto-centric future.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
They purchased streetcar networks that were failing because of car traffic and they tore up the tracks.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
They established toll-free highways funded largely by federal taxes,

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and they benefited from racism and classism by promising an urban renewal

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
by replacing marginalized communities with highways.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But I think the most significant thing that the highway lobby might have pulled off

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
was that they got us to stop imagining.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What are streets for?

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Through flashy exhibits and promises of modernity and freedom,

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
we allowed cars to take over the street, and in doing so,

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
changed the way we approach everything.

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Solving congestion went from moving people to moving cars.

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Reducing traffic accidents went from saving lives to getting pedestrians out of the way.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Cities went from dense hubs of community and trade to parking lots,

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
and people left to spend too much of their life in rush hour traffic.

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But to say that cars have just won forever would be a disservice to the many public transit projects

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
happening in Canada and North America.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Like Toronto, the city that I'm from, has some of the most public transit projects in North America.

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Except the only time that I hear about them is when things go wrong.

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And after learning what we've learned, I can't help but wonder,

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
is this the highway lobby?

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Are they doing something behind the scenes?

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So I read a few articles, talked to some people, and it turns out, probably not sabotage.

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But mostly, it's just a miracle that any public transit works.

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm Reese. I'm, I guess, primarily a YouTuber at RM Transit,

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and it's the same on Twitter, Instagram, all the socials that I also do transportation consulting.

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So in general, there are a variety of steps to planning a new big infrastructure transit project like this.

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You start with a good reason to build such a project, and then you move on to sort of planning.

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And with planning, you're looking at all kinds of different things.

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You know, you might have kind of a map of your city.

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Then you start trying to say, like, oh, how can we connect these things up and hit the necessary destinations?

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
There's all kinds of different geographical dependencies as well.

97
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
There might be a sewer line here, and you might have to figure out a way to go under it.

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Once you go through the planning process, you're probably going to start going into engineering.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You're going to look at the actual physical built environment.

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So maybe there's a mall and you got to send the train under the mall.

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Now you got to look at the foundations of the mall to make sure that you can actually dig a tunnel there

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
and that you're not going to cause the mall to collapse.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Once you have that, you're going to cost it out.

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
How many years is it probably going to take to build the thing?

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What materials do we need?

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What equipment do we need to buy so that we can now go and build this thing?

107
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And once we have the costing, then we can go to government.

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Everyone's favorite. And ask, please give me money.

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
If a project gets funded, then it moves to procurement, where different companies bid for contracts

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
to actually dig the holes and lay down lines.

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Once you figure out who's built and what, you actually have to build it, which means...

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You close down streets. You reroute buses.

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
There's tons of different planning and organization that has to happen in that.

114
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And then once everything is built, you need to test it.

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And it's not just seeing if a vehicle can move.

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's about the systems in and around it.

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And then it finally opens. And we're done. Right? Wrong.

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You've got vehicles, but you also have things like the tracks and the overhead wires

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
and the tunnels themselves that need to be checked up on a regular basis.

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
There are literally millions of components and thousands of sort of electronic devices that all need to be maintained.

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And there's usually very little time to do this since these things start early and run late.

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So if something goes wrong, like a flood or an electrical fire, everything else gets delayed.

123
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
There's sort of this avalanche of dependencies where you have,

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
oh, we were going to go fix the rails, but now we got to go fix the trains.

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So the rails got to get fixed in two weeks, but that means we've got to fix something else later.

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But so far, this has been really rail-focused.

127
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What about buses and other forms of sustainable transit?

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
They're cheaper and they're less disruptive to build and repair.

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The issue here is that, as with everything in transportation, you get into trade-offs.

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
When you have buses and rail, one of them is a bit more resilient and easy to manage,

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
but it's way more expensive to run buses if you want to move thousands and thousands of people.

132
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Because if you want to move a thousand people, you need like 12 buses, but you need one train.

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And that's 12 drivers versus one driver.

134
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So sometimes it makes more sense to commission a bus, other times a multi-use trail, other times trains.

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I like trains.

136
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It all really depends on what a community needs.

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Now, this means that things go wrong when the people involved in these projects forget about the community

138
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
or actively want to displace them.

139
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But this conversation also made me realize that sometimes things go wrong because this is just really hard.

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Deadlines are missed even when people don't want to miss deadlines.

141
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Sometimes maintenance is at an inconvenient time because there was a fire.

142
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
There wasn't supposed to be a fire, but there was one and we had to put it out.

143
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
My conversation with Reese at least gave me a little bit more sympathy for how hard all of this is.

144
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
If you like nuanced but optimistic news around public transit, you should really check out his channel.

145
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But either way, at least we know that as much work as it is to make public transit, when we do it, people are gonna use it.

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Right?

147
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Right?

148
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Welcome to the 401 in Toronto, Canada.

149
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It is the busiest highway in North America.

150
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And apparently it does give us an odd sense of pride.

151
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Does it, Kyle? Does it, Kyle?

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
There's so many cars.

153
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
There's a lot of cars.

154
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And I just find this kind of surprising because according to census data, there are a lot of people driving in and out of Toronto who don't need to.

155
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The rail service I'm riding right now connects these suburbs to the downtown core.

156
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If we compare the average commuter travel times, public transit should be the obvious choice every time.

157
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yet 91% of people commuting to Toronto still choose to drive rather than take public transit.

158
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This is a larger disparity than usual due to the pandemic's many impacts.

159
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But in 2016, it still wasn't even close.

160
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So even when public transit is available, there's no guarantee that people will use it.

161
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Why?

162
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
To answer that question, I needed to figure out what factors influence people to choose how they travel.

163
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So I picked up some beginner-friendly books on public transit design,

164
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
fell into the world of urban planning content, and spent a little too long playing mini-metro.

165
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yeah, I count this as research. No, I'm not very good at it.

166
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
When it comes to transit modes, we generally have three options.

167
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Public, private, and active.

168
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Each of these have pros and cons, not societal ones like I talked about for public transit at the start of this video,

169
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
but more like potential points of friction that might steer someone from one option to another.

170
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Because it turns out, individuals aren't always motivated by societal benefits.

171
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Take that, utilitarianism.

172
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Now, I could just list these factors, but I could also force my friends to experience them.

173
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Do I have any idea how to drive?

174
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes, I do have a license.

175
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I have 100% in the theory test if that helps.

176
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't need theory, I need practice because I need you guys to do a travel challenge with me.

177
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Okay, so we want to compare different modes of transit.

178
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
If we assume that the average person should be able to comfortably travel

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
between shelter, healthcare, education, and work in a reasonable amount of time,

180
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
then we can travel between those places and compare the experience and timing with Melissa driving,

181
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Taha taking public transit, and me walking.

182
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Well, I feel like I have a disadvantage in Toronto and you guys have home-field advantage,

183
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
so I don't really feel like that's a fair fight.

184
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Okay, so what's some neutral territory?

185
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Oh no, Ottawa?

186
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yes, it's still in Canada and yes, Melissa and I have been there before,

187
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
but it is so unmemorable that it isn't the problem.

188
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So I map for locations.

189
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The hotel we're staying at, a major hospital, the local university, and Parliament Hill.

190
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Because Answer in Progress is now a political party running on a platform of getting views.

191
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I don't think that this should be a competition though, right?

192
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's like a learning experience.

193
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I agree, it should be a competition.

194
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
No, that's-

195
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That's what you said and I agree with it.

196
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
This does mean that I'm gonna need to walk like three hours.

197
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It seems like a personal problem.

198
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I love our supportive work environment.

199
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
For the record, this is your idea.

200
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You called us and now you're complaining.

201
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm hanging up. Go away, go away!

202
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Who goes to Ottawa?

203
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What do you think of this train?

204
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I like this train, it's nice.

205
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I like trains.

206
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This is my baby's first vlog in public.

207
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Well, I have to walk, so I'm leaving now.

208
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Time starts 2.18.

209
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Goodbye everybody.

210
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
He's leaving.

211
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I've got to drive, so I gotta go get a car.

212
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I am taking public transit and I don't know anything about the public transit system in Ottawa.

213
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So I am going to figure that out.

214
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Here we go.

215
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I could get there 15 minutes driving or one hour and 11 minutes walking.

216
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm calling my shot and assuming I'm walking in the right direction.

217
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That's my ride.

218
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The farthest thing away is currently the hospital.

219
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Maybe 20 minutes.

220
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
That doesn't seem too bad.

221
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Hello, welcome to my public transit tier list.

222
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I couldn't figure out OBS, so we're doing this instead.

223
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
We're going to be ranking our modes of transit according to five categories that I'm going to dramatically reveal with time.

224
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Each one of these represent a potential point of friction that can influence whether or not somebody chooses to walk, drive or take public transit.

225
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So let's start with understanding.

226
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Understand.

227
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's important to know that there isn't anything inherently more straightforward about walking, driving or taking public transit in a new place.

228
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm definitely walking in the wrong direction.

229
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Cool.

230
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Love that for me.

231
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm being discriminated against for being British.

232
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
My 4G is not working and the Wi-Fi at the hotel is being mean.

233
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Alright.

234
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
No, boy, no.

235
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Is that a road closure?

236
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
We can't get a road closure already.

237
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Oh, wait, no.

238
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Am I supposed to go straight?

239
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
No, it says buses except I can't go straight.

240
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But even though our modes of transit can be equally complicated, the consequences of not understanding can vary.

241
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Like with walking, it's a little bit embarrassing, but you can get back on track pretty easily.

242
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Hi there.

243
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
This is South, right?

244
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Amazing.

245
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Thank you so much.

246
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It also isn't that bad for driving because of GPS.

247
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Things just get a little tricky when other drivers are involved.

248
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Can I turn right on red?

249
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm not sure if I can do that.

250
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Not a lot.

251
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Oh, there's cars behind me that are going to get mad.

252
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But with public transit, there is just so much that you need to understand.

253
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Like if there's a way to get to where you need to go.

254
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
40 minutes to get to the hospital.

255
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What do you need to take to get there?

256
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I can't really tell whether or not like a route is a bus or the tube.

257
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It just sort of says like this line or this number.

258
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So that's confusing.

259
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Where is the nearest stop?

260
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The confederation line is what I'm looking for, but I don't actually know where I can find it.

261
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I think it's just in here.

262
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm not sure though.

263
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
This place is so empty.

264
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's like something from a zombie film.

265
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
How do you pay?

266
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
By a single day pass.

267
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So one day it is from credit.

268
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yes, I would like a receipt.

269
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Day pass and then receipts.

270
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Cool.

271
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Try to take the confederation line to Blair three stops.

272
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And are you actually getting on the right thing?

273
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I am on the wrong side of the platform.

274
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Miss any of that up and you are in for a bad time.

275
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And that bad time is really common.

276
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Every New Yorker has not paid attention.

277
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Miss their stop.

278
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Gone over the bridge and then had to go all the way back around.

279
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And we've been testing and designing new maps for the entire New York City metropolitan area.

280
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And just trying to make it easier for everyone to get around the city.

281
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Now we know that making and maintaining a transit system is really difficult.

282
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
But it turns out that communicating that system so that the public understands is also really tricky.

283
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
While the subway diagram is meant to really guide you while you're underground.

284
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
When you get off at a station what landmarks are you near?

285
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What direction am I facing?

286
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It becomes really evident when there's not been sufficient thought like gone into these signs.

287
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Because a lot of it is physical signage.

288
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's so empty that I feel like I'm like trespassing.

289
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I might be.

290
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I don't know enough about this area.

291
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
A lot of times it does end up being like Unicode little emojis.

292
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Trains.

293
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
That's what I want.

294
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
There's so many people from around the world that may not know your language.

295
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But hey, with enough time and experience you can understand any mode of transit pretty well.

296
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
However, what those experiences feel like will vary pretty dramatically.

297
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
For example, if you're living in a society that was designed for motor vehicles,

298
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
walking isn't always a good time.

299
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Walking through a tunnel, it's a little scary.

300
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
No lighting.

301
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I was just trying to go through a crosswalk and somebody just started driving.

302
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I don't like this.

303
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Truly the only space between me and cars is like four feet.

304
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm really starting to realize that just because there's a place I can walk doesn't mean that it's walkable.

305
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm so tired.

306
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
There's the hospital.

307
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The current time is 4.01 pm.

308
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I made it.

309
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I wish I could fit a lower tier in frame.

310
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Anyway, as you could imagine, cars in public transit are a lot more comfortable.

311
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I wonder how the other two are doing.

312
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I hope they're okay.

313
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
They're staying warm and dry.

314
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I sure am because I am in a car.

315
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I've just reached University of Ottawa, which is fantastic.

316
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I didn't even realize it was on the road.

317
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yeah, parking, parking, parking, parking.

318
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I made it.

319
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I should take a selfie.

320
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm walking down a street called Industrial Avenue.

321
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It does not seem good.

322
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It does not seem promising.

323
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Like I get that it can be uncomfortable sitting or standing around strangers,

324
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
but at least you can zone out and do your own thing.

325
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And I can't really think of anything that is straight-up uncomfortable about driving

326
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
other than maybe finding a parking spot.

327
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I must stop. I did a bad parking job.

328
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Is that parking?

329
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That's not parking.

330
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I've made it to the University of Ottawa.

331
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
But that is nothing but small beans compared to walking in a place designed for cars.

332
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
There's nothing to see but highways or suburbs.

333
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Everything is so far apart.

334
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And I kept feeling with every sense I had of cars and buses just whooshing by so much faster.

335
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
My walking route has literally taken me to a public transit station.

336
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
There are buses.

337
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
There's an LRT, but now I need to walk.

338
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I hate committing to a bit.

339
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Y'all are never going to catch me committing to a bit ever again.

340
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
But hey, walking does have one major benefit.

341
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Freedom.

342
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
But really, it might be tiring or inconvenient,

343
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
but you can walk to a lot of places while enjoying more flexibility to explore

344
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
than cars or public transit.

345
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Location three, down.

346
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
When you're in a car, you make your destination and to make another pit stop,

347
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
you really have to figure out where you're going to park your car.

348
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
If I saw a café or something that I liked on my route,

349
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I wouldn't really want to get off the bus because if I get off the bus,

350
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
it's now like another like 15 to 20 minutes until the next bus.

351
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Now, this might not be a fair ranking for public transit

352
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
because in many cases it can enable more mobility and freedom.

353
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
However, that relies on a system being well designed and reliable.

354
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Something Ottawa public transit is not.

355
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I have been waiting for about 10 minutes and it said that the bus was going to be 5 minutes away for the last 10 minutes.

356
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
The only thing I can conclude is that the bus is lying.

357
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Now, we didn't know Ottawa's public transit reputation before we decided to go there,

358
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
but it turns out it's cursed.

359
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Ottawa once had an incredible bus rapid transit system with incredible lanes and roads,

360
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
but the city realized that they could reduce downtown congestion,

361
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
lower operating costs and service more people by replacing the buses with trains.

362
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So they did it badly.

363
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
There's a lot of nuance to this story,

364
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
but I just want to share the literal train wreck of a timeline.

365
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Late 2012, a transit line is approved to replace popular downtown bus routes.

366
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
2013, construction begins.

367
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
2014, a sinkhole opens?

368
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
But don't worry, doesn't cause too many issues.

369
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
2016, another sinkhole opens?

370
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
This one does cause a lot of issues.

371
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
2018, the project is supposed to be finished by now.

372
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It isn't. They still reduce bus service though.

373
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
2019, the line is almost done.

374
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's just having trouble passing testing standards.

375
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
But that's not a problem if you just change the testing standards.

376
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
They opened the transit line and cut the bus routes it was designed to replace.

377
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But uh-oh, the trains keep failing.

378
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Maybe testing is important?

379
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
2020.

380
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Some of the trains are pulled out of service because their wheels aren't round.

381
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
They should have watched our video to learn how to make a wheel.

382
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Oh, also parts of the train were falling on the tracks which was stopping other trains.

383
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
That's synergy, baby.

384
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
2021, derailment.

385
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Still 2021, another derailment.

386
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Also still 2021, fair increase?

387
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
The government finally asked, what happened here?

388
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
This year, the train is stopped for six days because of ice.

389
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And then again, a few months later for another two days.

390
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Bro, how am I making a video about public transit good and I accidentally put us in a city where public transit bad?

391
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Luckily, things are improving, slowly.

392
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Also, when I was on the tube or subway or whatever it is, um, it's quite slow.

393
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Yeah, I meant that literally because they need to run the trains more slowly to avoid wear and tear.

394
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
But not all hope is lost.

395
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
A lot of the systemic issues have been identified and as the line extends it'll get more useful.

396
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
However, a lot of the damage has kind of been done.

397
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I think what's been really difficult for me is how much trust has been eroded

398
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
and what kind of repair are we going to be able to create?

399
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What would it take to bring riders back?

400
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So is it a matter of looking at our fare structure and then other people are saying, well, not really.

401
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Because if I can't get from point A to point B reliably, I would never pay even nothing for it.

402
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So walking and driving are almost always going to get able-bodied people from point A to point B.

403
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
That is not a guarantee with public transit.

404
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Even if there is a route that can theoretically get you there, if you can't trust it to do that, then you won't use it.

405
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You can support public transit in theory, but if you can't use it in practice, why would you?

406
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
But wait, there's more.

407
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I need to figure out where Parliament Hill is.

408
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I don't know if it's a real hill or just like a metaphorical hill.

409
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I see Parliament, there are cars everywhere.

410
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I think that all of these roads around Parliament are closing.

411
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm going to figure out how to get to the last stop while I'm on the move.

412
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
There's like a proper news reporter.

413
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
The old school vlogger.

414
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I am right here.

415
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
There's a sign over there that says I can't park anywhere.

416
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
All the roads are closed.

417
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
This is as close as I'm going to get.

418
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Try to get over there.

419
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'm being obscured by clouds at the moment.

420
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
We're so close.

421
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Let's assume that all of these modes of transit can get you to where you need to go.

422
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
How long does that take?

423
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Good game, good game.

424
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.

425
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
We made it all at the same time.

426
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
The exact same time.

427
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I had to walk by like a four-lane highway for an hour.

428
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Oh my god.

429
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Walking.

430
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Terrible.

431
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Driving.

432
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I put it in the middle tier because sometimes it can be fast,

433
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
but other times the President of the United States might be in town

434
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
and all of the streets shut down.

435
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Hurt nobody.

436
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
But.

437
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Goodbye vehicle.

438
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Okay, there she is.

439
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I think I might see somebody.

440
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Who is that?

441
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
We made it.

442
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I think you beat me.

443
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
A little bit.

444
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
For all of the trust issues.

445
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
When public transit works, it works.

446
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I've been here for so long.

447
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
We should all say what time we arrived.

448
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
One, two, three, four, seven.

449
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I f***ing hate you guys.

450
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I have now combined all of our tier lists into one super tier list

451
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
based off our five points of friction.

452
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I've added a new access to the tier list system.

453
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Looking at all of this now, it's becoming really obvious to me

454
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
that this was really stupid.

455
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
But it does make it really obvious why people don't take public transit

456
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
and why they take cars instead.

457
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Because it can be tricky to understand public transit.

458
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
But even if you understand it, can you trust it

459
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
to take you to all the places you want to go?

460
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
In Canada and North America, the answer to that question

461
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
is pretty often no.

462
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
A lot of places are trying, but it's still going to take a while to get there.

463
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And sure, when public transit works, it is incredible.

464
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
But cars are gloriously mediocre.

465
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
They get you to where you need to go most of the time.

466
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It's not too bad.

467
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So for a lot of people, cars are the natural choice.

468
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
90% of the time.

469
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
But what about the other 10%?

470
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
After making this video, I now know that it isn't reasonable

471
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
to just expect everyone to take public transit all of the time.

472
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It isn't always practical.

473
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And it also requires a lot of trust and humility.

474
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Like it is humbling, chasing after a bus

475
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
and seeing it drive off.

476
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Or worse, getting stranded because the next one is late or cancelled.

477
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
But I still think it's worth the risk.

478
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Because small increases in public transit use

479
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
can have big social benefits.

480
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It might even make public transit itself better

481
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
because it shows that there's demand.

482
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Demand for better urban design, demand for better climate,

483
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
demand for streets to belong to people, not just cars.

484
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
If you take anything away from this video,

485
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I hope it's the knowledge that public transit,

486
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
even at its most cursed, most loathed,

487
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
it can still beat the alternatives from time to time.

488
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Which reminds me, I owe Taha Prize.

489
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Oh. Oh.

490
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
This is terrible.

491
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Yes!
