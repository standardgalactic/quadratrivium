0	2000	My heart is breaking.
2000	4000	Thank you! We got one!
4000	10000	I love public transit because it's great for the environment, it's good for communities and for public health.
10000	12000	And not because I suck at driving.
12000	14000	But not everybody feels that way.
14000	19000	And even if people do support public transit, even if they have access to it, they still might not choose to use it.
19000	21000	And I want to figure out why.
21000	25000	So I spent the last few weeks looking at maps, talking to people,
25000	29000	and exploring one of Canada's most cursed public transit projects to figure it out.
29000	32000	This place is so empty, it's like something from a zombie film.
32000	34000	It's a long story, let me explain.
34000	37000	Thank you to our supporters on Patreon for supporting the channel,
37000	40000	and to No Brainers for sponsoring this portion of the video.
40000	45000	Just like us, the team at No Brainers are a group of non-experts asking questions big and small,
45000	47000	and sharing the fun along the way.
47000	52000	Produced in partnership with TVO, they explore things like beauty brainwashing to endless scrolling.
52000	55000	Are we really in control of how makeup makes us feel?
55000	59000	What happens when you overstimulate your brain with a full day of mindless scrolling,
59000	62000	and then hit the brakes by jumping into a sensory deprivation tank?
62000	65000	All of it is available right now for free on YouTube.
65000	67000	If you like us, then you'll like them.
67000	69000	Their channel is linked in the description. Check them out.
69000	70000	Now back to the video.
70000	72000	I have always been a fan of public transit.
72000	76000	For all of the frustrations and faults, I think that it's a good thing.
76000	82000	Which is why it's so strange to me that Canada and America seem so different from our global peers.
82000	87000	Like, you look at the girl group of seven and you can't help but notice that we are just so far behind
87000	91000	in terms of infrastructure, but also user interest.
91000	97000	If we compare the amount of passenger cars per capita, Canadians and Americans just seem to prefer driving.
97000	98000	And I want to know why.
98000	101000	So to start, I think I need to find the facts in my feelings
101000	104000	and figure out if public transit is actually a good thing.
104000	107000	Is it something nice to have, or do we even need it?
108000	109000	Yes, we do.
109000	113000	So I tried to make a public transit pros and cons list for society.
113000	117000	And it was really hard because there are, like, no cons.
117000	118000	You know that TikTok audio?
118000	122000	Cosy economy benefits everybody, hurts nobody.
122000	124000	Yes, that is public transit.
124000	128000	It is safer and less fatal for riders and other street users than cars.
128000	130000	It encourages regular exercise.
130000	132000	It is way better for the environment.
132000	138000	It is also a way more efficient use of space because cars suck at maximizing the amount of people getting from point A to point B
138000	141000	and storing them is a nightmare.
141000	146000	It is also essential for people who do not have access to a car and need to get places.
146000	152000	But if you don't care about any of that and you just care about money, public transit is a good investment.
152000	159000	So if public transit is this great for society, why doesn't Canada and America have more of it?
159000	161000	Have you heard about the highway lobby?
161000	162000	Good job!
162000	164000	Now we weren't always bad at public transit.
164000	170000	In the early 1900s, vast rail networks connected the continent and streetcar systems weaved through cities
170000	173000	that you wouldn't traditionally consider hubs, like LA.
173000	175000	So what happened?
175000	179000	Well, it starts with the concept of a street which has surprisingly many uses.
179000	182000	A path, a playground, a potential profit.
182000	187000	That's because when a street belongs to everyone, everyone is free to imagine how they can use it.
187000	189000	It asks a question.
189000	190000	What am I for?
190000	194000	Believe it or not, in the early 1900s, we didn't have a clear answer.
194000	199000	But the rising popularity of cars was making it pretty obvious that we needed to find one.
199000	203000	Cars brought congestion, which made a lot of public transit impractical.
203000	206000	They also brought danger because they kept hitting people.
206000	211000	Cars also brought together enough collective interest and influence to finally answer the question.
211000	214000	Streets are for cars.
214000	218000	Now, the highway lobby did do a lot of things to literally pave the way for an auto-centric future.
218000	223000	They purchased streetcar networks that were failing because of car traffic and they tore up the tracks.
223000	227000	They established toll-free highways funded largely by federal taxes,
227000	232000	and they benefited from racism and classism by promising an urban renewal
232000	235000	by replacing marginalized communities with highways.
235000	239000	But I think the most significant thing that the highway lobby might have pulled off
239000	241000	was that they got us to stop imagining.
241000	243000	What are streets for?
243000	246000	Through flashy exhibits and promises of modernity and freedom,
246000	250000	we allowed cars to take over the street, and in doing so,
250000	253000	changed the way we approach everything.
253000	256000	Solving congestion went from moving people to moving cars.
256000	261000	Reducing traffic accidents went from saving lives to getting pedestrians out of the way.
261000	266000	Cities went from dense hubs of community and trade to parking lots,
266000	271000	and people left to spend too much of their life in rush hour traffic.
271000	276000	But to say that cars have just won forever would be a disservice to the many public transit projects
276000	278000	happening in Canada and North America.
278000	282000	Like Toronto, the city that I'm from, has some of the most public transit projects in North America.
282000	286000	Except the only time that I hear about them is when things go wrong.
286000	289000	And after learning what we've learned, I can't help but wonder,
289000	291000	is this the highway lobby?
291000	293000	Are they doing something behind the scenes?
293000	297000	So I read a few articles, talked to some people, and it turns out, probably not sabotage.
297000	302000	But mostly, it's just a miracle that any public transit works.
302000	306000	I'm Reese. I'm, I guess, primarily a YouTuber at RM Transit,
306000	312000	and it's the same on Twitter, Instagram, all the socials that I also do transportation consulting.
312000	319000	So in general, there are a variety of steps to planning a new big infrastructure transit project like this.
319000	324000	You start with a good reason to build such a project, and then you move on to sort of planning.
324000	327000	And with planning, you're looking at all kinds of different things.
327000	330000	You know, you might have kind of a map of your city.
330000	335000	Then you start trying to say, like, oh, how can we connect these things up and hit the necessary destinations?
335000	339000	There's all kinds of different geographical dependencies as well.
339000	343000	There might be a sewer line here, and you might have to figure out a way to go under it.
343000	349000	Once you go through the planning process, you're probably going to start going into engineering.
349000	353000	You're going to look at the actual physical built environment.
353000	356000	So maybe there's a mall and you got to send the train under the mall.
356000	360000	Now you got to look at the foundations of the mall to make sure that you can actually dig a tunnel there
360000	362000	and that you're not going to cause the mall to collapse.
362000	364000	Once you have that, you're going to cost it out.
364000	368000	How many years is it probably going to take to build the thing?
368000	370000	What materials do we need?
370000	374000	What equipment do we need to buy so that we can now go and build this thing?
374000	378000	And once we have the costing, then we can go to government.
378000	381000	Everyone's favorite. And ask, please give me money.
381000	386000	If a project gets funded, then it moves to procurement, where different companies bid for contracts
386000	388000	to actually dig the holes and lay down lines.
388000	392000	Once you figure out who's built and what, you actually have to build it, which means...
392000	395000	You close down streets. You reroute buses.
395000	399000	There's tons of different planning and organization that has to happen in that.
399000	402000	And then once everything is built, you need to test it.
402000	404000	And it's not just seeing if a vehicle can move.
404000	407000	It's about the systems in and around it.
407000	412000	And then it finally opens. And we're done. Right? Wrong.
412000	417000	You've got vehicles, but you also have things like the tracks and the overhead wires
417000	421000	and the tunnels themselves that need to be checked up on a regular basis.
421000	428000	There are literally millions of components and thousands of sort of electronic devices that all need to be maintained.
428000	433000	And there's usually very little time to do this since these things start early and run late.
433000	437000	So if something goes wrong, like a flood or an electrical fire, everything else gets delayed.
437000	441000	There's sort of this avalanche of dependencies where you have,
441000	445000	oh, we were going to go fix the rails, but now we got to go fix the trains.
445000	449000	So the rails got to get fixed in two weeks, but that means we've got to fix something else later.
449000	451000	But so far, this has been really rail-focused.
451000	453000	What about buses and other forms of sustainable transit?
453000	456000	They're cheaper and they're less disruptive to build and repair.
456000	460000	The issue here is that, as with everything in transportation, you get into trade-offs.
460000	464000	When you have buses and rail, one of them is a bit more resilient and easy to manage,
464000	469000	but it's way more expensive to run buses if you want to move thousands and thousands of people.
469000	473000	Because if you want to move a thousand people, you need like 12 buses, but you need one train.
473000	475000	And that's 12 drivers versus one driver.
475000	481000	So sometimes it makes more sense to commission a bus, other times a multi-use trail, other times trains.
481000	482000	I like trains.
482000	485000	It all really depends on what a community needs.
486000	490000	Now, this means that things go wrong when the people involved in these projects forget about the community
490000	492000	or actively want to displace them.
492000	500000	But this conversation also made me realize that sometimes things go wrong because this is just really hard.
500000	503000	Deadlines are missed even when people don't want to miss deadlines.
503000	507000	Sometimes maintenance is at an inconvenient time because there was a fire.
507000	511000	There wasn't supposed to be a fire, but there was one and we had to put it out.
511000	515000	My conversation with Reese at least gave me a little bit more sympathy for how hard all of this is.
515000	519000	If you like nuanced but optimistic news around public transit, you should really check out his channel.
519000	527000	But either way, at least we know that as much work as it is to make public transit, when we do it, people are gonna use it.
527000	528000	Right?
530000	531000	Right?
532000	535000	Welcome to the 401 in Toronto, Canada.
535000	537000	It is the busiest highway in North America.
537000	541000	And apparently it does give us an odd sense of pride.
541000	543000	Does it, Kyle? Does it, Kyle?
543000	545000	There's so many cars.
545000	546000	There's a lot of cars.
549000	556000	And I just find this kind of surprising because according to census data, there are a lot of people driving in and out of Toronto who don't need to.
556000	560000	The rail service I'm riding right now connects these suburbs to the downtown core.
560000	565000	If we compare the average commuter travel times, public transit should be the obvious choice every time.
565000	570000	Yet 91% of people commuting to Toronto still choose to drive rather than take public transit.
570000	574000	This is a larger disparity than usual due to the pandemic's many impacts.
574000	577000	But in 2016, it still wasn't even close.
577000	582000	So even when public transit is available, there's no guarantee that people will use it.
582000	583000	Why?
583000	588000	To answer that question, I needed to figure out what factors influence people to choose how they travel.
589000	592000	So I picked up some beginner-friendly books on public transit design,
592000	597000	fell into the world of urban planning content, and spent a little too long playing mini-metro.
597000	601000	Yeah, I count this as research. No, I'm not very good at it.
601000	604000	When it comes to transit modes, we generally have three options.
604000	606000	Public, private, and active.
606000	611000	Each of these have pros and cons, not societal ones like I talked about for public transit at the start of this video,
611000	616000	but more like potential points of friction that might steer someone from one option to another.
616000	620000	Because it turns out, individuals aren't always motivated by societal benefits.
620000	622000	Take that, utilitarianism.
622000	627000	Now, I could just list these factors, but I could also force my friends to experience them.
627000	629000	Do I have any idea how to drive?
629000	631000	Yes, I do have a license.
631000	634000	I have 100% in the theory test if that helps.
634000	641000	I don't need theory, I need practice because I need you guys to do a travel challenge with me.
641000	643000	Okay, so we want to compare different modes of transit.
643000	646000	If we assume that the average person should be able to comfortably travel
646000	651000	between shelter, healthcare, education, and work in a reasonable amount of time,
651000	656000	then we can travel between those places and compare the experience and timing with Melissa driving,
656000	659000	Taha taking public transit, and me walking.
659000	664000	Well, I feel like I have a disadvantage in Toronto and you guys have home-field advantage,
664000	667000	so I don't really feel like that's a fair fight.
667000	669000	Okay, so what's some neutral territory?
669000	671000	Oh no, Ottawa?
671000	674000	Yes, it's still in Canada and yes, Melissa and I have been there before,
674000	677000	but it is so unmemorable that it isn't the problem.
677000	679000	So I map for locations.
679000	683000	The hotel we're staying at, a major hospital, the local university, and Parliament Hill.
683000	688000	Because Answer in Progress is now a political party running on a platform of getting views.
688000	691000	I don't think that this should be a competition though, right?
691000	693000	It's like a learning experience.
693000	695000	I agree, it should be a competition.
695000	696000	No, that's-
696000	698000	That's what you said and I agree with it.
698000	701000	This does mean that I'm gonna need to walk like three hours.
701000	703000	It seems like a personal problem.
703000	705000	I love our supportive work environment.
705000	708000	For the record, this is your idea.
708000	711000	You called us and now you're complaining.
711000	712000	I'm hanging up. Go away, go away!
714000	716000	Who goes to Ottawa?
716000	718000	What do you think of this train?
718000	720000	I like this train, it's nice.
720000	722000	I like trains.
722000	725000	This is my baby's first vlog in public.
725000	728000	Well, I have to walk, so I'm leaving now.
728000	730000	Time starts 2.18.
730000	731000	Goodbye everybody.
731000	732000	He's leaving.
732000	734000	I've got to drive, so I gotta go get a car.
734000	742000	I am taking public transit and I don't know anything about the public transit system in Ottawa.
742000	746000	So I am going to figure that out.
746000	747000	Here we go.
747000	751000	I could get there 15 minutes driving or one hour and 11 minutes walking.
751000	754000	I'm calling my shot and assuming I'm walking in the right direction.
754000	755000	That's my ride.
755000	758000	The farthest thing away is currently the hospital.
758000	759000	Maybe 20 minutes.
759000	761000	That doesn't seem too bad.
761000	764000	Hello, welcome to my public transit tier list.
764000	767000	I couldn't figure out OBS, so we're doing this instead.
767000	772000	We're going to be ranking our modes of transit according to five categories that I'm going to dramatically reveal with time.
772000	778000	Each one of these represent a potential point of friction that can influence whether or not somebody chooses to walk, drive or take public transit.
778000	780000	So let's start with understanding.
780000	781000	Understand.
781000	788000	It's important to know that there isn't anything inherently more straightforward about walking, driving or taking public transit in a new place.
788000	790000	I'm definitely walking in the wrong direction.
790000	791000	Cool.
791000	792000	Love that for me.
792000	794000	I'm being discriminated against for being British.
794000	799000	My 4G is not working and the Wi-Fi at the hotel is being mean.
801000	802000	Alright.
802000	804000	No, boy, no.
804000	805000	Is that a road closure?
805000	807000	We can't get a road closure already.
807000	808000	Oh, wait, no.
808000	809000	Am I supposed to go straight?
809000	812000	No, it says buses except I can't go straight.
812000	817000	But even though our modes of transit can be equally complicated, the consequences of not understanding can vary.
817000	821000	Like with walking, it's a little bit embarrassing, but you can get back on track pretty easily.
821000	822000	Hi there.
822000	823000	This is South, right?
823000	824000	Amazing.
824000	825000	Thank you so much.
825000	828000	It also isn't that bad for driving because of GPS.
828000	831000	Things just get a little tricky when other drivers are involved.
831000	834000	Can I turn right on red?
834000	835000	I'm not sure if I can do that.
835000	836000	Not a lot.
836000	838000	Oh, there's cars behind me that are going to get mad.
838000	841000	But with public transit, there is just so much that you need to understand.
841000	843000	Like if there's a way to get to where you need to go.
843000	846000	40 minutes to get to the hospital.
846000	847000	What do you need to take to get there?
847000	852000	I can't really tell whether or not like a route is a bus or the tube.
852000	855000	It just sort of says like this line or this number.
855000	857000	So that's confusing.
857000	858000	Where is the nearest stop?
858000	862000	The confederation line is what I'm looking for, but I don't actually know where I can find it.
862000	863000	I think it's just in here.
863000	864000	I'm not sure though.
864000	865000	This place is so empty.
865000	867000	It's like something from a zombie film.
867000	868000	How do you pay?
868000	870000	By a single day pass.
870000	872000	So one day it is from credit.
872000	873000	Yes, I would like a receipt.
873000	875000	Day pass and then receipts.
875000	876000	Cool.
876000	879000	Try to take the confederation line to Blair three stops.
879000	881000	And are you actually getting on the right thing?
881000	885000	I am on the wrong side of the platform.
885000	888000	Miss any of that up and you are in for a bad time.
888000	891000	And that bad time is really common.
891000	894000	Every New Yorker has not paid attention.
894000	895000	Miss their stop.
895000	898000	Gone over the bridge and then had to go all the way back around.
898000	903000	And we've been testing and designing new maps for the entire New York City metropolitan area.
903000	907000	And just trying to make it easier for everyone to get around the city.
907000	910000	Now we know that making and maintaining a transit system is really difficult.
910000	916000	But it turns out that communicating that system so that the public understands is also really tricky.
916000	921000	While the subway diagram is meant to really guide you while you're underground.
921000	924000	When you get off at a station what landmarks are you near?
924000	925000	What direction am I facing?
925000	932000	It becomes really evident when there's not been sufficient thought like gone into these signs.
932000	935000	Because a lot of it is physical signage.
935000	939000	It's so empty that I feel like I'm like trespassing.
939000	940000	I might be.
940000	943000	I don't know enough about this area.
943000	947000	A lot of times it does end up being like Unicode little emojis.
947000	948000	Trains.
948000	949000	That's what I want.
949000	952000	There's so many people from around the world that may not know your language.
952000	956000	But hey, with enough time and experience you can understand any mode of transit pretty well.
956000	961000	However, what those experiences feel like will vary pretty dramatically.
961000	964000	For example, if you're living in a society that was designed for motor vehicles,
964000	967000	walking isn't always a good time.
967000	969000	Walking through a tunnel, it's a little scary.
969000	970000	No lighting.
970000	974000	I was just trying to go through a crosswalk and somebody just started driving.
974000	976000	I don't like this.
976000	982000	Truly the only space between me and cars is like four feet.
982000	989000	I'm really starting to realize that just because there's a place I can walk doesn't mean that it's walkable.
989000	990000	I'm so tired.
990000	992000	There's the hospital.
992000	997000	The current time is 4.01 pm.
997000	999000	I made it.
999000	1001000	I wish I could fit a lower tier in frame.
1001000	1005000	Anyway, as you could imagine, cars in public transit are a lot more comfortable.
1005000	1007000	I wonder how the other two are doing.
1007000	1008000	I hope they're okay.
1008000	1011000	They're staying warm and dry.
1011000	1013000	I sure am because I am in a car.
1013000	1016000	I've just reached University of Ottawa, which is fantastic.
1016000	1017000	I didn't even realize it was on the road.
1017000	1019000	Yeah, parking, parking, parking, parking.
1019000	1020000	I made it.
1020000	1023000	I should take a selfie.
1023000	1026000	I'm walking down a street called Industrial Avenue.
1026000	1028000	It does not seem good.
1028000	1029000	It does not seem promising.
1029000	1033000	Like I get that it can be uncomfortable sitting or standing around strangers,
1033000	1036000	but at least you can zone out and do your own thing.
1040000	1043000	And I can't really think of anything that is straight-up uncomfortable about driving
1043000	1046000	other than maybe finding a parking spot.
1046000	1048000	I must stop. I did a bad parking job.
1048000	1050000	Is that parking?
1050000	1051000	That's not parking.
1051000	1054000	I've made it to the University of Ottawa.
1054000	1057000	But that is nothing but small beans compared to walking in a place designed for cars.
1057000	1059000	There's nothing to see but highways or suburbs.
1059000	1060000	Everything is so far apart.
1060000	1065000	And I kept feeling with every sense I had of cars and buses just whooshing by so much faster.
1065000	1071000	My walking route has literally taken me to a public transit station.
1071000	1073000	There are buses.
1073000	1077000	There's an LRT, but now I need to walk.
1077000	1079000	I hate committing to a bit.
1079000	1083000	Y'all are never going to catch me committing to a bit ever again.
1083000	1086000	But hey, walking does have one major benefit.
1086000	1087000	Freedom.
1087000	1089000	But really, it might be tiring or inconvenient,
1089000	1093000	but you can walk to a lot of places while enjoying more flexibility to explore
1093000	1095000	than cars or public transit.
1095000	1097000	Location three, down.
1097000	1101000	When you're in a car, you make your destination and to make another pit stop,
1101000	1104000	you really have to figure out where you're going to park your car.
1104000	1109000	If I saw a café or something that I liked on my route,
1109000	1112000	I wouldn't really want to get off the bus because if I get off the bus,
1112000	1117000	it's now like another like 15 to 20 minutes until the next bus.
1117000	1120000	Now, this might not be a fair ranking for public transit
1120000	1124000	because in many cases it can enable more mobility and freedom.
1124000	1128000	However, that relies on a system being well designed and reliable.
1128000	1131000	Something Ottawa public transit is not.
1131000	1139000	I have been waiting for about 10 minutes and it said that the bus was going to be 5 minutes away for the last 10 minutes.
1139000	1143000	The only thing I can conclude is that the bus is lying.
1143000	1147000	Now, we didn't know Ottawa's public transit reputation before we decided to go there,
1147000	1149000	but it turns out it's cursed.
1149000	1153000	Ottawa once had an incredible bus rapid transit system with incredible lanes and roads,
1153000	1156000	but the city realized that they could reduce downtown congestion,
1156000	1161000	lower operating costs and service more people by replacing the buses with trains.
1161000	1163000	So they did it badly.
1163000	1164000	There's a lot of nuance to this story,
1164000	1167000	but I just want to share the literal train wreck of a timeline.
1167000	1172000	Late 2012, a transit line is approved to replace popular downtown bus routes.
1172000	1175000	2013, construction begins.
1175000	1177000	2014, a sinkhole opens?
1177000	1179000	But don't worry, doesn't cause too many issues.
1179000	1182000	2016, another sinkhole opens?
1182000	1184000	This one does cause a lot of issues.
1184000	1187000	2018, the project is supposed to be finished by now.
1187000	1190000	It isn't. They still reduce bus service though.
1190000	1192000	2019, the line is almost done.
1192000	1194000	It's just having trouble passing testing standards.
1194000	1198000	But that's not a problem if you just change the testing standards.
1198000	1201000	They opened the transit line and cut the bus routes it was designed to replace.
1201000	1204000	But uh-oh, the trains keep failing.
1204000	1206000	Maybe testing is important?
1206000	1207000	2020.
1207000	1210000	Some of the trains are pulled out of service because their wheels aren't round.
1210000	1212000	They should have watched our video to learn how to make a wheel.
1212000	1215000	Oh, also parts of the train were falling on the tracks which was stopping other trains.
1215000	1217000	That's synergy, baby.
1217000	1219000	2021, derailment.
1219000	1222000	Still 2021, another derailment.
1222000	1225000	Also still 2021, fair increase?
1225000	1228000	The government finally asked, what happened here?
1228000	1232000	This year, the train is stopped for six days because of ice.
1232000	1236000	And then again, a few months later for another two days.
1236000	1243000	Bro, how am I making a video about public transit good and I accidentally put us in a city where public transit bad?
1243000	1247000	Luckily, things are improving, slowly.
1247000	1254000	Also, when I was on the tube or subway or whatever it is, um, it's quite slow.
1254000	1259000	Yeah, I meant that literally because they need to run the trains more slowly to avoid wear and tear.
1259000	1260000	But not all hope is lost.
1260000	1265000	A lot of the systemic issues have been identified and as the line extends it'll get more useful.
1265000	1269000	However, a lot of the damage has kind of been done.
1269000	1274000	I think what's been really difficult for me is how much trust has been eroded
1274000	1278000	and what kind of repair are we going to be able to create?
1278000	1281000	What would it take to bring riders back?
1281000	1287000	So is it a matter of looking at our fare structure and then other people are saying, well, not really.
1287000	1294000	Because if I can't get from point A to point B reliably, I would never pay even nothing for it.
1294000	1299000	So walking and driving are almost always going to get able-bodied people from point A to point B.
1299000	1301000	That is not a guarantee with public transit.
1301000	1307000	Even if there is a route that can theoretically get you there, if you can't trust it to do that, then you won't use it.
1307000	1312000	You can support public transit in theory, but if you can't use it in practice, why would you?
1312000	1314000	But wait, there's more.
1314000	1316000	I need to figure out where Parliament Hill is.
1316000	1320000	I don't know if it's a real hill or just like a metaphorical hill.
1320000	1322000	I see Parliament, there are cars everywhere.
1322000	1325000	I think that all of these roads around Parliament are closing.
1325000	1328000	I'm going to figure out how to get to the last stop while I'm on the move.
1328000	1330000	There's like a proper news reporter.
1330000	1332000	The old school vlogger.
1332000	1334000	I am right here.
1334000	1337000	There's a sign over there that says I can't park anywhere.
1337000	1338000	All the roads are closed.
1338000	1340000	This is as close as I'm going to get.
1340000	1342000	Try to get over there.
1342000	1345000	I'm being obscured by clouds at the moment.
1345000	1346000	We're so close.
1346000	1350000	Let's assume that all of these modes of transit can get you to where you need to go.
1350000	1352000	How long does that take?
1352000	1354000	Good game, good game.
1354000	1356000	Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.
1356000	1358000	We made it all at the same time.
1358000	1360000	The exact same time.
1360000	1365000	I had to walk by like a four-lane highway for an hour.
1365000	1366000	Oh my god.
1366000	1367000	Walking.
1370000	1371000	Terrible.
1371000	1372000	Driving.
1372000	1374000	I put it in the middle tier because sometimes it can be fast,
1374000	1378000	but other times the President of the United States might be in town
1378000	1380000	and all of the streets shut down.
1380000	1381000	Hurt nobody.
1381000	1382000	But.
1382000	1384000	Goodbye vehicle.
1384000	1385000	Okay, there she is.
1385000	1388000	I think I might see somebody.
1388000	1389000	Who is that?
1391000	1392000	We made it.
1392000	1393000	I think you beat me.
1393000	1394000	A little bit.
1394000	1396000	For all of the trust issues.
1398000	1402000	When public transit works, it works.
1402000	1404000	I've been here for so long.
1404000	1406000	We should all say what time we arrived.
1406000	1410000	One, two, three, four, seven.
1411000	1413000	I f***ing hate you guys.
1414000	1417000	I have now combined all of our tier lists into one super tier list
1417000	1419000	based off our five points of friction.
1419000	1421000	I've added a new access to the tier list system.
1421000	1424000	Looking at all of this now, it's becoming really obvious to me
1424000	1426000	that this was really stupid.
1426000	1429000	But it does make it really obvious why people don't take public transit
1429000	1431000	and why they take cars instead.
1431000	1434000	Because it can be tricky to understand public transit.
1434000	1436000	But even if you understand it, can you trust it
1436000	1439000	to take you to all the places you want to go?
1439000	1442000	In Canada and North America, the answer to that question
1442000	1444000	is pretty often no.
1444000	1447000	A lot of places are trying, but it's still going to take a while to get there.
1447000	1449000	And sure, when public transit works, it is incredible.
1449000	1452000	But cars are gloriously mediocre.
1452000	1455000	They get you to where you need to go most of the time.
1455000	1456000	It's not too bad.
1456000	1459000	So for a lot of people, cars are the natural choice.
1459000	1461000	90% of the time.
1461000	1463000	But what about the other 10%?
1463000	1465000	After making this video, I now know that it isn't reasonable
1465000	1468000	to just expect everyone to take public transit all of the time.
1468000	1470000	It isn't always practical.
1470000	1473000	And it also requires a lot of trust and humility.
1473000	1476000	Like it is humbling, chasing after a bus
1476000	1478000	and seeing it drive off.
1478000	1482000	Or worse, getting stranded because the next one is late or cancelled.
1482000	1484000	But I still think it's worth the risk.
1484000	1486000	Because small increases in public transit use
1486000	1488000	can have big social benefits.
1488000	1491000	It might even make public transit itself better
1491000	1493000	because it shows that there's demand.
1493000	1496000	Demand for better urban design, demand for better climate,
1496000	1499000	demand for streets to belong to people, not just cars.
1499000	1501000	If you take anything away from this video,
1501000	1503000	I hope it's the knowledge that public transit,
1503000	1506000	even at its most cursed, most loathed,
1506000	1511000	it can still beat the alternatives from time to time.
1511000	1515000	Which reminds me, I owe Taha Prize.
1515000	1518000	Oh. Oh.
1520000	1522000	This is terrible.
1522000	1523000	Yes!
