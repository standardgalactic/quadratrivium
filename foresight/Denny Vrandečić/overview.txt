Checking Denny Vrandečić/The Future of Knowledge Graphs in a World of Large Language Models.txt
1. **Knowledge Graphs as Ground Truth**: Knowledge graphs like Wikidata serve as a reliable source of information, ensuring that facts such as Barack Obama's place of birth are stored once and can be retrieved without repetition. These graphs are valuable as they act as a public good, providing accurate knowledge for various applications.

2. **Integration with Language Models**: Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 can assist in populating knowledge graphs by extracting information from text. This symbiotic relationship allows for the improvement of both systems.

3. **Symbolic Representation of Knowledge**: Knowledge graphs enable the representation of knowledge in a symbolic form that can be edited, audited, and curated. This is crucial for maintaining accuracy and completeness.

4. **Special Values in Knowledge Graphs**: Current knowledge graphs use two special values: "no value" (e.g., Elizabeth I has no children) and "unknown value" (e.g., Adam Smith's father is unknown). A third special value, "it's complicated," is suggested to mark areas where the knowledge graph cannot provide a definitive answer.

5. **Expressivity of Statements**: Knowledge graphs need to be able to handle more complex statements to capture the nuances of knowledge. This involves enhancing the expressivity of Wikipedia-like data to include sophisticated sentences like "Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system."

6. **Challenges with Language Models**: While LLMs are powerful tools, they also have limitations such as hallucinating information, being expensive to train and run, and being difficult to audit and explain, especially in sensitive areas like finance and medicine.

7. **Future of Knowledge Graphs**: The future of knowledge graphs is bright, particularly because of the enhanced capabilities of LLMs. Knowledge graphs can address many of the challenges posed by LLMs, including inconsistencies, language coverage gaps, and long tail entity issues.

8. **Conclusion**: Knowledge graphs are crucial for providing a ground truth for LLMs, ensuring that these models can be relied upon to provide accurate information. The relationship between knowledge graphs and LLMs is mutually beneficial and holds significant potential for the future of AI-assisted knowledge management.
