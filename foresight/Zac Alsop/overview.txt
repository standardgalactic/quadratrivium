Checking Zac Alsop/Sneaking In Worlds Most Secure Festival Through A Secret Tunnel.txt
 In this episode of "I Don't Like Mondays," the YouTubers MmmYosh and JB are attempting to sneak into the highly secured Glastonbury Festival without proper tickets or authorization. They spend hours strategizing and waiting for the right moment to approach the fence due to tight security. Yosh, in particular, is focused on finding a way through a narrow gap in the fence, which he eventually manages to do by squishing through with his 27-centimeter waist. After successfully bypassing the gate, they make it into the festival grounds and are elated at their accomplishment. They express their admiration for the festival's security measures but also their triumph in outsmarting them. The episode captures the tension and excitement of their illegal entry, as well as their relief and joy upon finally being inside the festival.
