1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,600
That was a lovely introduction, wasn't it?

2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,400
It went on a bit too long, but I didn't mind.

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:36,040
This evening I'm going to talk about, I've borrowed from Donald Rumsfeld the subtitle,

4
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,760
because I'm going to talk about essentially the contents of this book, The World According

5
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,760
to Physics.

6
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,760
It's not my most recent book.

7
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,720
I think there may have been some confusion in the blurb.

8
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:52,480
I had a book came out this year called The Joy of Science, which I was a bit concerned

9
00:00:52,480 --> 00:01:01,560
about because when my publisher, my editor said, great title, it's based on this cookery

10
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,560
book in America.

11
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,200
I forget the name of the author in the 1950s, The Joy of Cooking, and he said, we're calling

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
it Joy of Science.

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:14,320
I said, you do know there's another book, The Joy of, which begins with an S. That might

14
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,720
help with sales, maybe.

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,320
But anyway, I'm talking about, this is the book before last, The World According to Physics.

16
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,040
There are many books, popular science books on physics.

17
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,680
Those of you who read and follow popular science will know that every year there are probably

18
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,840
a dozen or more good books that tell the story of what we understand about the universe and

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,720
about reality.

20
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,880
Many of them are very big books, over a thousand pages.

21
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,880
This one is small.

22
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,880
It's almost pocket-sized.

23
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:58,280
If we think about our knowledge of the physical universe as an island, these books will explore

24
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,280
the whole island.

25
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,280
They will tell the history of how we came to understand what we know, and they try and

26
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,040
cover all aspects.

27
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,320
This book is a walk around the shoreline of the island.

28
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:18,320
The edges, the limits of what we currently understand, and what there is out there that

29
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,840
we still need to understand.

30
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,240
So I'm going to try and get through.

31
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,680
I'm not going to be able to cover all areas of physics in 50, 45, 50 minutes, because

32
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,920
I want to give some time for questions, but I'll see what I can do.

33
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,760
I want to start with this article by Stephen Hawking.

34
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:47,840
So this was in 1981, over 40 years ago, predicting the end of theoretical physics.

35
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,600
So he says, in this article, I want to discuss the possibility that the goal of theoretical

36
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,040
physics might be achieved in the not too distant future.

37
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,640
He was talking by the end of the 20th century.

38
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,760
This was just before the big revolution in what we call super string theory, but that

39
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:11,000
was the mood in theoretical physics in the last few decades of the 20th century.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,840
They felt we're nearly there.

41
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,440
We nearly have a theory of everything, a theory that unifies all the phenomena and the forces

42
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:28,600
and behavior of the physical universe into one equation you can wear on a t-shirt.

43
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:37,160
Of course, it reminds us of what physicists thought at the end of the 19th century, because

44
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:45,440
again, by the 1890s, well, we have electromagnetism, we have Newtonian mechanics, we have thermodynamics

45
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,360
and statistical mechanics.

46
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,240
We know everything, and then they discover the electron, they discover x-rays, they discover

47
00:03:53,240 --> 00:04:00,480
radioactivity, and then Max Planck kicks off the quantum revolution, and Einstein comes

48
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,480
up.

49
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:08,000
They realized that actually what we thought was the whole, the explanation of everything,

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,840
was a long way from what we now understand.

51
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,160
We were a long way from the end, and I would argue that again, we are actually a long way

52
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,160
from the end.

53
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,000
Even Hawking was wrong.

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,800
We are not near the end of being able to unify all our theories.

55
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:36,960
If I think back during my career in physics, what new discoveries, exciting changes, what

56
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,840
is there the equivalent of the discovery of the x-ray and radioactivity and the electron,

57
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,960
the end of the 19th century?

58
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:53,360
Well, here are two, probably the most popular, famous examples, the conformation, discovery

59
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,200
of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012, and a few years later, the discovery

60
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:06,000
of the first gravitational waves at these big experimental facilities, the LIGO facilities

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,440
in America, both of them quite correctly made headlines around the world.

62
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,600
Everyone was talking about the Higgs boson.

63
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,200
Most people don't understand, even most physicists don't actually understand what the Higgs boson

64
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,320
really is, but it's exciting.

65
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,480
We discovered it.

66
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:29,960
Discovered gravitational waves, Nobel prizes to everybody.

67
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:36,280
The problem is, of course, neither of these discoveries was a surprise.

68
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,840
Peter Higgs and others, he wasn't the only one, even though the particle was named after

69
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,360
them.

70
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,040
They had predicted the existence of the Higgs field, the Higgs mechanism and the Higgs

71
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:54,600
boson back in the 1960s, half a century they had been waiting for the experimental physicists

72
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:01,960
to build a machine, the Large Hadron Collider, that could create this particle and prove

73
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,160
that their theory was right, but it wasn't a surprise.

74
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,400
The waves even longer, Einstein's general theory of relativity, back over a hundred

75
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:19,440
years ago, almost exactly a century before the discovery, was predicted.

76
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,160
If general relativity is correct, there should be these gravitational waves from big disturbances

77
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,360
of matter in the universe, sending ripples through space.

78
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,000
So again, tick the box.

79
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:42,640
It would have been more interesting if we had not found the Higgs boson, not for the

80
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,680
guys who were working at the Large Hadron Collider who had invested their careers, in

81
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,760
it they were very relieved and excited and very happy, but for many other physicists,

82
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,200
it would have been more interesting, actually, if the Higgs boson didn't exist, because

83
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,840
it means there's something missing in our current theories and we need to go back and

84
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,960
think up something new, more Nobel Prizes.

85
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:16,360
The only real surprise in the last few decades in physics was back in 1998, and that was

86
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:25,640
a discovery of dark energy, this mysterious force pushing the universe apart, a discovery

87
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:31,400
by astronomers that the universe is actually expanding faster now than it was in the past.

88
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:38,160
We've known, until then, until 1998, all the textbooks would say the universe began

89
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,040
with a big bang and it's been expanding, but ever since then, gravity has been slowing

90
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,040
down the expansion.

91
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,400
Everything's pulling everything else together, stopping it from spreading out from each other.

92
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,200
Then in 1998, they discover by looking at the most distant galaxies in the universe that

93
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,480
we can see, they're moving away from us at a speed that suggests that they're moving

94
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:08,480
away faster, the universe is stretching faster now than it was in the past.

95
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,200
That needed explaining, and it still needs explaining.

96
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:18,240
This is one example of something that Stephen Hawking, certainly when he wrote that article

97
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,040
in 1981, certainly couldn't have predicted.

98
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,960
By the way, this picture here was produced, I wrote, I don't know if you have it in Denmark,

99
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,960
they're called Ladybird Books.

100
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,640
They're tiny little books where they have one page of text and one page of illustrations,

101
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:41,400
and they're meant to be for children, but adults like them as well, and it was very

102
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
nice.

103
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,480
I wrote a Ladybird book on gravity, and the artist was very talented, so he produced it,

104
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,840
so I had a page talking about dark energy, and he produced this lovely image of something

105
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:58,200
from Star Wars.

106
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,560
There are things we don't understand, and even now in popular science certainly, but

107
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:09,200
also in serious physics and cosmology research, there are still questions that we don't know

108
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,240
the answer to, we can't agree on.

109
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,480
Dark energy is one, there's also dark matter, which is a different thing, dark matter is

110
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,160
not the same as dark matter, dark matter we've known about for a long time, but we still

111
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,520
don't know what it is, we don't know what it's made of.

112
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,840
There's also things like the question of the Big Bang itself.

113
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:34,840
No physicist or astronomer, cosmologist who has studied the subject enough would argue

114
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,920
about the Big Bang.

115
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:45,880
We all agree our universe started from a very hot, dense initial state, but can we ask the

116
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,880
question what was before the Big Bang?

117
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,840
And when I give talks to school kids, they'll say, yeah, but what made the Big Bang?

118
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,040
What happened before?

119
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,360
If you're religious, if you have religious faith, you say, well, there was some supernatural

120
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:07,440
divine creator that pushed the button created, and then that explains everything.

121
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:15,280
But it wasn't even a question that was allowed in science until recent years.

122
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,400
The usual answer was this.

123
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,320
You go back earlier and earlier and earlier in time, the Big Bang is the moment that space

124
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,840
and time themselves were created.

125
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,160
And so it's the same as, so you can't say what was before the Big Bang, because there

126
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,800
was no time to put the word before in.

127
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,480
That was the beginning of time.

128
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:45,240
It's like, say, walk to the South Pole, and when you reach the South Pole, keep walking

129
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,240
south.

130
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,120
It doesn't make it right.

131
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,160
Every step you take from the South Pole takes you back north again.

132
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,080
It's the further south you can go.

133
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:59,400
It makes no sense to say what is south of the South Pole without leaving the Earth.

134
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,160
So in a similar way, what is before the Big Bang makes no sense.

135
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,360
Besides that, in recent years, that has also been questioned.

136
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,480
There are ideas in cosmology suggesting maybe there was a before the Big Bang.

137
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:21,640
In fact, the idea used to be that there was the Big Bang, and then the universe expanded.

138
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:28,000
Space sort of expanded as time went on, and matter cooled down, and atoms and then stars

139
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,440
were created.

140
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,840
To explain some of the properties of the universe, cosmologists invented this concept

141
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:43,960
called inflation, where just after the Big Bang, space expanded very, very quickly just

142
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,600
to smooth things out.

143
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,120
We needed that much quicker expansion, just for a tiny fraction of a second, and then

144
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,360
the expansion slowed down to a more normal pace.

145
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,320
Well, of course, now there's another idea that maybe the inflation happened before the

146
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,800
Big Bang.

147
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:11,400
Maybe our universe is just a bubble in a much bigger, what we regard as the universe is

148
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,920
just a small part of everything, the multiverse.

149
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,360
And maybe the multiverse is constantly undergoing inflation.

150
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,200
In fact, it's called eternal inflation.

151
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,840
And then every now and again, there'll be a bubble appearing in this internal inflation,

152
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,880
and that's a Big Bang of one universe.

153
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:39,800
And our universe, everything we see, is just one bubble in this multiverse of universes.

154
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:47,200
So this is another picture from that Lady Bird book, which I quite like, Me Making Bubble

155
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Universes.

156
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,360
Again, I just tell the artists, I say, well, you know, multiverse, bubble universes, and

157
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,120
he says, OK, leave it with me.

158
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,120
I'll do something artistic.

159
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:09,320
So our journey in terms of what we know now, and we know we haven't reached the end of

160
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:16,720
the road, has been certainly since the beginning of modern science, since the scientific revolution

161
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:26,080
in the 16th, 17th centuries, has been a journey of unification, finding different phenomena

162
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,800
and things in the universe to explain, and realizing they're connected with each other,

163
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:39,480
realizing they're part of some deeper truth that simplifies, I guess, our picture.

164
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
So this is a slide.

165
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,160
I'm very happy it's a very big screen, because the fonts I use are quite small, and I fill

166
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
it up.

167
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,280
When I'm giving a talk on a small screen, I can't tell the words, so it's good.

168
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
You can enjoy it.

169
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:58,000
OK, so this is the journey through evolution, through unification.

170
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,320
Start off in the top corner.

171
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
That's the size.

172
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,320
See?

173
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,400
Now you know what I mean.

174
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,360
I'm going to fill it.

175
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:14,480
Probably the first, in modern science, the first idea of unifying concepts that were

176
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:21,080
regarded as being very different was by Isaac Newton, who comes up with his law of gravitation.

177
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:28,360
He says the apple falling to the ground is experiencing the same force as the force that

178
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,080
keeps the planets in orbit around the sun and the moon in orbit around the earth.

179
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:38,280
Until then, no one thought that was, why would that be obvious?

180
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,640
The forces of nature governing the heavens should have nothing to do with why.

181
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,160
The apple would prefer to be lower down towards the ground.

182
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,160
So he unified those two ideas.

183
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:57,880
OK, then 19th century, middle of the 19th century, people like Michael Faraday and James

184
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:05,240
Clark Maxwell realized that electricity and magnetism, we know what electricity is, we

185
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,760
know what magnetism is, they're actually part of the same, they are described by the

186
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:16,080
same fundamental force, the electromagnetic force.

187
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,080
So again, we have some unifying ideas.

188
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:26,120
Then we jump down here, again, 19th century, second half of the 19th century, people, well

189
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,000
throughout the 19th century, people working on the idea of heat and work and energy and

190
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,600
the power of steam and developing engines.

191
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:40,120
And then that gets unified with an idea called statistical mechanics.

192
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,920
People like Ludwig Boltzmann working on this.

193
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,000
And they are unified today, what we teach to physicists at the university is a subject

194
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:58,320
called thermodynamics, OK, and it's essentially the idea of heat and temperature and pressure

195
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:08,520
and how you describe matter at the larger scale in terms of fundamental particles interacting

196
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
with each other.

197
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,080
OK, we jump up to here.

198
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:17,400
No surprises who made the connection between space and time.

199
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,120
That was Einstein in his special theory of relativity in 1905.

200
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:30,760
Of course, in that same theory, he shows that matter and energy are equivalent, interchangeable.

201
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:37,960
But we've now hit the 20th century, 10 years after Einstein's special theory of relativity,

202
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:43,080
he applies it to gravity and replaces Newton's picture of gravity.

203
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:49,680
He says Newton thought gravity was just this invisible force that pulls objects together.

204
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,440
Einstein says no, it's not a force at all.

205
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:58,160
Gravity is the shape of space-time, it's geometry.

206
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,800
And in general relativity, to be fair, it's not an easy subject.

207
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:07,360
It's only taught to students in their last year of university, typically.

208
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,560
Einstein had to go and learn the mathematics before he could develop general relativity.

209
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:19,520
So that was tough, but it was one of the great triumphs of 20th century physics.

210
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,160
OK, we now jump down to, oh, OK, so general relativity gives us cosmology, and I want

211
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,400
to jump down here, you can see it on the left, atoms.

212
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,680
The existence of atoms wasn't really confirmed until the beginning of the 20th century.

213
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:41,280
In fact, also due a lot to the work of Einstein.

214
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,600
By the First World War, people like Ernest Rutherford were now being able to see inside

215
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
atoms.

216
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,960
They could understand the structure of atoms, and it was made of a nucleus with electrons

217
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,600
going around it.

218
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:03,600
And then by the 1920s, the early work on quantum theory became quantum mechanics.

219
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:09,040
And since you are from Copenhagen, you will know that your city played a big role in the

220
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:16,320
development of quantum mechanics, because Niels Bohr, having worked in the UK, in Cambridge,

221
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,520
in Manchester, he comes back to Copenhagen, he gets money from the Karlsberg Brewery to

222
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:27,920
build his new institute in 1920, and he brings together the great geniuses of the time, Werner

223
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,800
Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli, Erwin Schrodinger, and Rie Kelsferme.

224
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,840
They are the great names that every physicist admires, that they are our heroes.

225
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,160
They developed quantum mechanics, the theory that describes the subatomic world, the world

226
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
of the very small.

227
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,600
General relativity describes the very big, quantum mechanics the very small.

228
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,040
Two very different theories.

229
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:57,880
By the late 1920s, quantum mechanics and special relativity are joined together, and we have

230
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,640
something called quantum field theory.

231
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,760
Now I'm going to speed up, because I've got to fill up the rest of the screen, and I don't

232
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,120
want to use up all my time.

233
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,760
So, electromagnetism, combined with quantum field theory, gives us something called quantum

234
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,440
electrodynamics, by the middle of the 20th century, people like Richard Feynman have

235
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:21,960
developed this theory, so you can see lots of words on the left, fewer words as I move

236
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,120
across to the right.

237
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,320
Nuclear physics, we find inside the nucleus two new forces, until then there was gravity

238
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,440
and electromagnetism, just two forces.

239
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,440
Now we discover two new forces.

240
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,240
They have to be explained, they're explained using quantum field theory, so we have something

241
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,640
called quantum chromodynamics.

242
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:51,040
Quantum chromodynamics and quantum electrodynamics, and the weak force gives us electro-weak theory.

243
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:56,680
Finally, we combine all the quantum stuff together, and we have what's called the standard

244
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:02,760
model of particle physics, and at the very top, cosmology, we have the standard model

245
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,920
of cosmology.

246
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:11,960
Don't worry about the lambda CDM, that's the best we can do to describe the universe

247
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:18,880
at large, the standard model of particle physics, best we can do to describe the very small.

248
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:25,800
Of course, standard model of cosmology still has things to be explained, dark matter and

249
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,400
dark energy, we still have to understand them.

250
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:37,200
But, and this is what Stephen Hawking was hoping for in his comment about the physics

251
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,720
coming to an end.

252
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:47,560
He was hoping to combine the cosmology and the particle physics together into one theory

253
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:53,520
of quantum gravity, so quantum gravity is the small connected with the large, sometimes

254
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,280
it's called a theory of everything.

255
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,280
We don't have it yet, which is why I've put a dashed line around it.

256
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,600
This is, we're still looking.

257
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,640
One argument, which I'm actually quite in favour of, is that we're not going to get

258
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:18,640
a theory of everything unless we bring in that last, that third pillar, thermodynamics

259
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,320
as well.

260
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,280
Maybe there are other areas of physics that are going to have to be involved as well,

261
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,880
so I just wanted to fill up some white spaces.

262
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,200
There's quantum information theory, there's non-linear dynamics, non-equilibrium thermodynamics,

263
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,600
there's the black hole information, which is a whole other lecture, which I'm not going

264
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,840
to go into.

265
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:48,600
Lots of dashed lines, lots of question marks, we are nowhere near Stephen Hawking's dream

266
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,880
of the end of theoretical physics.

267
00:21:51,880 --> 00:22:00,000
In fact, to show you one other picture from the Lady Bird book, this depicts the struggle

268
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,720
between the two leading, potentially, or have been for some years, leading contenders for

269
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:14,800
a possible theory of quantum gravity, depicted as superheroes having an arm wrestle.

270
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,720
On the left, there's the string theory that wants to unify the forces of physics.

271
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,360
On the right, there's something called loop quantum gravity that wants to see how space

272
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:32,720
time itself comes about, how it's created.

273
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,120
There are lots more people working on string theory than loop quantum gravity.

274
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,440
In fact, there have been several books out in recent years criticising string theory,

275
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:49,880
partly because it hasn't led to the success that people had hoped, but also in part out

276
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:56,440
of jealousy, because string theory has sucked all the cleverest physicists to work in that

277
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,960
field, and all the other physicists working in other areas, you know, why is string theory

278
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,160
getting all the bright guys?

279
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:15,920
They haven't had the success that it was hoped they would have 20 or so years ago.

280
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:25,840
So are we at the stage now where we have to maybe take a step back and try and understand

281
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:32,240
or re-examine the most basic ideas about reality?

282
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,000
What is space itself?

283
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,200
It's a long argument about whether space is a real thing.

284
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:45,880
So people like Aristotle and Descartes argued that space isn't real.

285
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:53,120
It's only defined by being the distance between things or being the volume inside something.

286
00:23:53,120 --> 00:24:00,240
Isaac Newton said, no, space is a thing, space is real, it's the fabric, it's the canvas,

287
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:06,520
it's the stage on which the universe is built.

288
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:12,000
Imagine you have an empty box, complete vacuum inside it.

289
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,320
I know in quantum language I should say there's always something, there's always particles

290
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:23,320
popping in and out of existence, but let's just imagine it's completely just empty space.

291
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:29,920
Does the box exist if I remove the walls?

292
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:35,940
Was that space only real because there were walls to define it?

293
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:42,120
What about if I put the box inside a larger volume, also empty, and now remove the walls

294
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,360
of the inner box?

295
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,880
Is it space now real because it's forming part of the larger volume inside the larger

296
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,320
box?

297
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:58,480
These are questions that sound trivial, that sound almost childish.

298
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,800
We have figured out what space is.

299
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:10,280
What the best answer we have so far is what Einstein tells us.

300
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,800
Now Einstein published a book called Relativity, the Special and General Theory.

301
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,880
He published it first in German.

302
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,560
In fact, very soon after he published his work on general relativity, and it's almost

303
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,960
like a popular science book.

304
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,880
It's not a textbook as such.

305
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,200
It was translated into English and other languages.

306
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:37,880
There were many editions of this book, but usually when a book comes out in new editions,

307
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,360
the author changes some things and updates them.

308
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,680
With this book, Einstein didn't change anything from the original.

309
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,160
He just added appendices at the end.

310
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:54,160
Appendix number five, the most famous one, appeared the year before he died.

311
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,280
That was the last addition to the book.

312
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,200
In it, he gives a definition of what space is.

313
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,480
He says, if we imagine the gravitational field to remove, we take gravity away.

314
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,800
We take matter and energy away from the universe.

315
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,280
There's no stuff.

316
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,360
Therefore, there's no gravity.

317
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,840
There does not remain any spacetime, but absolutely nothing.

318
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:25,840
He's saying that Aristotle and Descartes were right, that without matter, without the

319
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,640
walls of the box, there is no spacetime.

320
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:37,160
He also says, spacetime does not claim existence on its own, but only as a structural quality

321
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,640
of the gravitational field.

322
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,840
You need stuff for space.

323
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:48,160
In Einstein's language, we have to talk about spacetime to actually exist.

324
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:55,200
Yet, he also points out that Newton is right, because spacetime is a real thing.

325
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:01,000
It could be stretched and bent and twisted and warped through the action of gravity.

326
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,080
But for Einstein, spacetime is the gravitational field.

327
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:12,000
His equations of general relativity is an equation, so it has an equal sign with something

328
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,560
on one side and something on the other.

329
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:21,000
On one side is matter and energy, mass and energy, and the other side is space and time.

330
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:28,320
You know from primary school maths with an equal sign, if one side is zero, the other

331
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,720
side is zero as well.

332
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
They're equal.

333
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,520
If you take away matter and energy, there's no spacetime.

334
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:42,400
Take away spacetime, there's no matter and energy.

335
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,800
Is that the end of the story?

336
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:51,840
Well, no, because one of the things that I've been talking here about general relativity,

337
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,720
I've been missing the other big theory of 20th century physics, which is quantum mechanics.

338
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,800
And the whole point is how do we bring quantum mechanics and general relativity together?

339
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,480
And then the story really changes.

340
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,120
In fact, I've asked what is space.

341
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,400
I might as well ask what is time?

342
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:20,280
And yeah, there are lots of jokes about what is time, and it's just nature's way of stopping

343
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:27,000
everything from happening at once is one definition.

344
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,680
But the different areas of physics all give the different pillars of 20th century physics,

345
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,240
all give different definitions of what time is.

346
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,200
So general relativity says time is part of the fabric of the universe.

347
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,160
It's part of spacetime.

348
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,520
It's a dimension that can be stretched and warped.

349
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:54,080
It's an axis in four dimensions.

350
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,160
Quantum mechanics says time is a parameter, it's just a number.

351
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:03,160
Number you plug into your equation, you can run the equation forwards, you can run it backwards.

352
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,760
It's no more profound than that.

353
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,600
And then you have thermodynamics, which says no, time isn't a dimension or a number, it's

354
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,160
an arrow.

355
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,280
It points in a certain direction.

356
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:21,080
It points from past to future.

357
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:26,680
Until we can reconcile these three ways of thinking about time together, I don't think

358
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:30,240
we're going to be able to unify physics.

359
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:38,120
In fact, the search for a theory of everything we talk about unifying general relativity

360
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:45,080
in quantum mechanics, well, even Einstein himself argued that actually thermodynamics

361
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,560
might be the most important idea.

362
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:53,360
He says thermodynamics is the only physical theory of universal content, which I'm convinced

363
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,640
would never be overthrown.

364
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,560
But even Einstein's admitting we may have to change general relativity, we may have

365
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:04,320
to tweak or modify quantum mechanics to get them together.

366
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:12,800
But thermodynamics, that's sacred in as much as physicists can talk about something as

367
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:19,000
not open to discussion or debate.

368
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,240
So I want to focus a little bit about this idea of time and this arrow of time.

369
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,840
I want to talk about it a bit because, and I will say at the end of my talk, how am I

370
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,280
doing for talking about time?

371
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,280
Good.

372
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:35,600
Okay, about 15 minutes, 15 or 20 minutes.

373
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,040
It's the current era of my own research, trying to understand the nature of the direction

374
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,200
of time, why is there a past and a future?

375
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,960
And this goes back to an idea called Loschmitt's Paradox.

376
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,920
We're aware that time has a direction and you might even think that's a trivial, a stupid

377
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,960
question.

378
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,080
Of course time goes from the past to the future because the past happens before the future.

379
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,760
You can't go backwards.

380
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:10,320
And yet, all the fundamental equations, the dynamical theories of physics, don't care

381
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,280
which direction time goes, forwards or backwards.

382
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,280
They work.

383
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:19,680
They say the laws of physics are the same in either direction.

384
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:25,840
Only the second law of thermodynamics is what gives us the arrow of time that says

385
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,920
time has a specific direction.

386
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,680
So think about the orbits of the planets around the sun.

387
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:37,800
We know they go around the sun anti-clockwise in this picture from looking down from above,

388
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,200
well actually even from below as well.

389
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:47,000
But if they went around the other way, it wouldn't break any laws of physics.

390
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,280
It could have been possible for them to have gone around the other way.

391
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:59,920
Particles moving around in a box, that random motion of particles bumping into each other.

392
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,080
If I told you I'm starting to run this film backwards, it wouldn't make any difference

393
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,080
to you.

394
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:13,560
So describing these phenomena using equations of statistical mechanics or Newtonian mechanics

395
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,560
doesn't matter.

396
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,400
No direction to time.

397
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:23,160
Particle collisions, this is called a Feynman diagram for those of you who are not familiar

398
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,160
with it.

399
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,200
The arrows show the direction of particles, A and B, coming together.

400
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,120
They feel some force, the dashed line, and then they move apart.

401
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:40,800
Maybe that force changes those particles into new particles, C and D. But the laws of physics

402
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:46,360
down at the particle level says well in that case C and D could also come together, interact

403
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,520
and create A and B in the other direction.

404
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,480
That's also possible.

405
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,640
But in our everyday world, we have an hour of time.

406
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,000
We have ice that melts.

407
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,880
It doesn't freeze unless you do something to it.

408
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,720
If you put a glass somewhere and isolated, the ice will eventually melt in the water.

409
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,320
It doesn't go the other way.

410
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,760
Air leaks out at a punctured tire.

411
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,160
It doesn't come back in again if the pressure is different.

412
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,480
An atom or atomic nucleus undergoes radioactive decay.

413
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,640
It spits out alpha particles.

414
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:33,920
You don't see alpha particles coming from outside, ending up inside a nucleus.

415
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,800
Heat radiates from a hot object.

416
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,400
Objects slow down due to friction.

417
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,720
Chemical reactions very often move only one direction and not in the other.

418
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:48,160
These things can all happen in reverse, but it's very, very unlikely.

419
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,840
They're all described by the laws of thermodynamics.

420
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,440
This paradox says where does this hour of time come from?

421
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,960
What's its origin?

422
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:05,720
The usual answer, which cosmologists will tell you, and they have a valid point.

423
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:13,920
If anyone listens to the podcast Minescape by Sean Carroll, American physicist, very

424
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,560
eloquently explains this standard answer.

425
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,560
It says, well, time flows in the direction of increasing entropy.

426
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,760
Entropy is the amount of disorder.

427
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,720
The amount of information gathered about a system.

428
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,800
Let's keep it to a simple definition.

429
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:41,560
If I have a pack of cards that is all organized in suits and numbers, 2, 3, 4, 5, all the

430
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:49,360
way up to an ace in each suit separately, and I shuffle the cards, I'll mix them up.

431
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:55,520
That is in direction of increasing entropy, the increase of disorder of the cards.

432
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:02,040
It is possible, by further shuffling, I would get back to the ordered state again, but it's

433
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,840
very, very unlikely, and you can calculate the probability of it, you know, take the

434
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:13,560
age of, longer than the age of the universe, and I'm just not that patient.

435
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,360
But that's the direction of increasing entropy.

436
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:20,320
The direction of time is the direction in which cards become more shuffled, more mixed

437
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,320
up.

438
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:27,400
The direction in which your cream mixes with your coffee, not the opposite.

439
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,360
So you can't run those films backwards.

440
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:35,040
You would see that there's something wrong, right?

441
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,040
But then why?

442
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,040
Why does entropy increase?

443
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,440
Well, the standard answer is, well, because it was lower in the past.

444
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,080
Okay, well, is that an expression?

445
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,640
Well, why was it lower in the past?

446
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,160
Because it was lower before that.

447
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,160
Why was it before?

448
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,160
Because it was lower.

449
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:57,840
And you go all the way back, and you say, why does the egg get broken, become an omelet,

450
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,640
and you don't get the other way around?

451
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,800
Because entropy was very low at the Big Bang.

452
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:13,200
So that's called the past hypothesis.

453
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,800
Some people might find it satisfying, some people might find it mind-blowing, some people

454
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,680
might find it ridiculous.

455
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:28,840
The reason you can make an omelet that you can't remake an unbroken raw egg from an omelet

456
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:39,120
is because entropy was low at the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago seems a bit strange.

457
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,680
And I don't think it solves the problem.

458
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,560
So the problem is that all our equations of physics are symmetric in time, right?

459
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:50,960
So you're given a moment in time, you run into the future and you see how things change.

460
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,920
If you run into the past, there will change in the same symmetric way as they do in the

461
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,920
future.

462
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,800
You can run it forwards and backwards and nothing changes.

463
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:06,720
Well, all we're doing is saying that special moment, so entropy increases into the future,

464
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,600
but these equations would say, well, entropy will also increase into the past because you

465
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,000
have to have symmetry.

466
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,120
So how do we get rid of this crazy idea that entropy increases in the past?

467
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:26,400
Move that special now moment, put it right at the beginning, and then only worry about

468
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,800
things happening in the future.

469
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,480
You don't have to worry about the past because there was nothing before the Big Bang.

470
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:40,840
It seems cheating, which will come at the end to say something about what my current

471
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,760
thinking is on the subject.

472
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:50,600
I want to say something about, well, this is quantum mechanics, right?

473
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:55,440
A wave function, cats in boxes, that's all I need to show, quantum mechanics.

474
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:01,080
Quantum entanglement, as I think you heard in the little intro video, and so I won't

475
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:07,720
repeat again about Einstein and spookiness because that gets used too often.

476
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:15,080
The idea is, it used to be a rather strange idea in quantum mechanics, and we wasn't really

477
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:21,800
taught to students because we didn't think it was important enough that two quantum particles,

478
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:28,360
like two electrons, could somehow, their fates are intertwined, they're interconnected, that's

479
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:33,280
such that you can't describe them separately, you have to describe them both together.

480
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,760
And this means if you influence one, if you look at one or change it or measure it, you're

481
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,080
immediately affecting the other one.

482
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:48,160
We're now beginning to understand that quantum entanglement is actually a profoundly important

483
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:56,480
idea that may play a role in finding a theory of everything, may play a role in understanding

484
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,160
the era of time.

485
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:04,120
I want to quickly run through this really nice idea, which I hope is right, but it's

486
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,560
not my idea, right?

487
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:12,760
But it would be cool if it's correct, but that's not good enough in physics, unfortunately.

488
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:18,920
Anyway, most famous equation in physics, yeah, boring.

489
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,640
Here's this nice equation.

490
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,440
Some of you may have heard of it, if you're a physicist, you might have heard of it if

491
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,000
you follow popular science.

492
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,200
Usually you see something like this and you think, okay, I know algebra, E cancels with

493
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:40,640
E, R cancels with R, I don't know, one equals P. Well, that's even more boring than equals

494
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,640
mc squared.

495
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,280
That's not what this is.

496
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,920
You see, this is not an equation.

497
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:54,840
These letters don't symbolize physical quantities like energy or pressure.

498
00:39:54,840 --> 00:40:05,640
They are the initials of physicists who came up with two very clever ideas.

499
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:15,240
This is a paper that was published in the 1930s by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, so

500
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:22,440
E, P, and R, and they were asking a question about this idea about quantum entanglement.

501
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:37,600
So they were questioning whether quantum mechanics was complete.

502
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:43,280
They didn't really believe this idea of quantum entanglement.

503
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:51,920
And so they published this paper in 1935 and gave rise to what we now call the EPR paradox

504
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:57,400
and I will go through it very, really good to go through the EPR paradox in two minutes.

505
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,400
Let's see.

506
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,400
All right.

507
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:04,200
Imagine you have a box that can produce two particles, say photons, particles of light

508
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,640
back to back, okay?

509
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,640
They fly out and they reach some distance apart.

510
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,880
I've made them, I've drawn them like this because they're not particles and they're

511
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,880
not waves.

512
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,720
They're some sort of in-between thing, depending on how you look at them.

513
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,520
Then we want to examine photon one.

514
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:32,360
We take our instrument, our detector, that measures the wavelength of the light.

515
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:40,000
Now that means it's measuring the energy or the speed of the light.

516
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,600
Tells you where it is, sorry, tells you what its frequency is.

517
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:52,440
Now that means it's seeing that photon as a wave.

518
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,560
Since the photons came out where they're created from the same source back to back, they're

519
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,560
both traveling, they both have the same energy.

520
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:07,600
So if we know the wavelength of the light photon one, then that means we also know the

521
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,960
wavelength of photon two.

522
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:15,440
So without looking at photon two, we can say it has this wavelength.

523
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:21,920
But we could have chosen to measure the position of photon one.

524
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,280
That means we've now got, we're doing a different experiment.

525
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,000
We now have a detector that doesn't look at the wavelength of photon one, but where it

526
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
is.

527
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,720
It sort of captures it and finds out exactly what its position is.

528
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,000
So now it's measuring the photon as a particle.

529
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,280
Well, if the photons are both traveling as particles back to back with the same speed,

530
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:50,040
then photon number two will be the same distance on the other side of the box from photon number

531
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,040
one.

532
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:56,360
So without looking at photon number two, we can tell you where it is.

533
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:01,280
Einstein, Podolski and Rosen said, well, that's weird, isn't it?

534
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:06,800
Sure, photon number one's properties depend on what you measure.

535
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,760
And this is one of the ideas in quantum mechanics.

536
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,600
If you look at wave nature, you find a wave.

537
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,600
If you set up an experiment to find particle nature, you see a particle.

538
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:22,200
But you can't have something that's both a point particle located somewhere, but at

539
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,520
the same time a spread out wave.

540
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,760
And yet that's what they seem to be saying about photon two.

541
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:34,680
Without touching it, I could assign to it an exact wavelength, and I could assign to

542
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,760
it an exact position.

543
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:42,040
Therefore, quantum mechanics, which says this is impossible, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle

544
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,400
and all that business, can't be right.

545
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,380
That was their argument.

546
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:55,480
But of course, since then, we've realized that photon two knows what you're going to

547
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:01,640
do to photon one and behaves accordingly, because photon one and photon two are quantum

548
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,640
entangled.

549
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:12,560
It's physicists tend to be able to get around this with clever language, because the usual

550
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:20,560
question is how can photon two immediately, instantaneously know what you're doing to

551
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,560
photon one?

552
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:26,160
Surely this means some instantaneous faster than light connections.

553
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,800
This is what Einstein didn't like.

554
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:35,360
And physicists say, well, you can't use it to send signals faster than light.

555
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:40,800
It's only at the quantum level, at the mathematical level, that they are instantaneously connected.

556
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,000
Don't worry about it.

557
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,640
But if they're honest, they are.

558
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,040
These two photons could be on either side of the universe.

559
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,840
And I measure one, and that influences the spin of the other.

560
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:56,240
I can't predict in advance what it's going to be, because they're subject to quantum

561
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,240
probabilities.

562
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:05,320
But in recent years, there's been an idea that suggests maybe this can be explained,

563
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:11,800
because there was, within a few weeks of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen publishing their paper,

564
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:17,760
two of them, Einstein and Rosen, published another paper in which they were trying to

565
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,760
understand some problem with general relativity.

566
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,560
So not a problem with quantum mechanics, but a problem with the very large.

567
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:30,280
And the problem there was general relativity predicts the existence of black holes.

568
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:36,240
And black holes, so the theory in its simplest form suggests, at their center is what's

569
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:43,840
called the singularity, a point of zero size, an infinite space-time curvature.

570
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:49,080
And I said, it doesn't like zero size, because that means it has infinite density.

571
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:57,000
It's like dividing by zero on your calculator, or for young people on your smartphone.

572
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,160
So Einstein and Rosen changed it.

573
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,160
So what if the middle of a black hole isn't a point?

574
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:09,360
What if it's a tunnel, a bridge, which became known as the Einstein-Rosen bridge?

575
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:13,120
Those of you who've seen Avengers Endgame, which I rewatched the other day, by the way,

576
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,240
which is why I remember, they talk about it.

577
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:19,600
Atman says, oh, yes, what you mean, an Einstein-Rosen bridge.

578
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:27,320
They clearly had spoken to physicists to get the dialogue sounding sciency.

579
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:33,840
So within a few weeks of each other, Einstein and colleagues, they publish a paper on the

580
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:40,320
EPR paradox, and they publish another paper on the ER, Einstein-Rosen bridge in general

581
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,200
relativity.

582
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:48,160
The idea there is that you have, imagine, two points distance in space, A and B. They're

583
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:55,240
very far, but if space can be bent over, then the distance between them is much smaller.

584
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,600
That's what we now call a wormhole, right?

585
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,880
Okay, so the Einstein-Rosen bridge was the old idea.

586
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:06,680
Then when people like Kip Thorne, a cosmologist in America, worked on it, it became in popular

587
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,360
culture known as the wormhole.

588
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,360
So here we go.

589
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:21,080
So in 2013, two American physicists, Juan Maldeseno and Lenny Saskind, published a paper.

590
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:27,000
You can't tell from the title, cool horizons for entangled black holes exactly what their

591
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:33,840
trick is, but it's a really neat idea because they bring together those two ideas.

592
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:39,760
Imagine you have two ends of a wormhole.

593
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,960
These are not two black holes.

594
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,280
If there are black holes, those circles will be black.

595
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,640
There's no light can come out.

596
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:50,720
But these are meant to be what are called traversable or lorenzian wormholes.

597
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:55,360
So what you're seeing through this mouth of the wormhole is what the universe looks like

598
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,280
out of the other end, vice versa.

599
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,440
Where is the tunnel between them?

600
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:05,840
Well, it's outside of our space, so we can't see it.

601
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:10,000
But we can't see it if we collapse our space into two dimensions.

602
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:18,760
So if I'm flattened space out, I add some grids just so that it looks physically, alright?

603
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,880
And then we have the wormhole between them.

604
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:31,920
Saskind and Maldeseno's idea was that what if the two entangled photons in the Ypres

605
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,920
are paradox.

606
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:40,720
Well, any two entangled particles are in fact only able to communicate seemingly instantaneously

607
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,240
with each other if they're joined by a quantum wormhole.

608
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:52,560
So the idea is that the reason why entanglement seems so strange is because what we can't

609
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:58,960
see is that those particles are interconnected by this network of wormholes.

610
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,640
That's the origin of entanglement.

611
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:09,760
It's a beautiful idea in its simplest form because it says that entanglement is the thread

612
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,440
that produces the fabric of space-time.

613
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:19,600
Its quantum entanglement is that holds and creates space and time together.

614
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:27,160
But those are just words and particularly very simplistic words because the theory hasn't

615
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,160
been worked out and evolved completely yet.

616
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:36,280
But it may be the whole of space-time is really just some quantum foam, lots of wormholes

617
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,600
popping in and out of existence, connecting things together.

618
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:43,920
I wanted to end very quickly because I've already gone beyond my time and I wanted to

619
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,920
give you a chance for questions.

620
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:51,160
But I was asked by the organizers to say a little bit about my own current research.

621
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:56,760
So I'm based at the University of Surrey in Guilford, just south of London, and we set

622
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,760
up a quantum foundation.

623
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:02,600
So we've got a big research grant from an American foundation called the John Templeton

624
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,200
Foundation.

625
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,800
And we had this really cool title of our project.

626
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:11,040
We basically said, right, we're going to give you some really, really sexy words, give us

627
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,840
lots of money.

628
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:18,480
And so we said, life on the edge, quantum, thermo, and quantum energy in the era of time.

629
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,600
But it's a big collaboration.

630
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:26,000
Six universities are involved in it.

631
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,520
And now I'm finally where, over the last 20 years, I've done a lot of work on broadcasting

632
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:33,320
as you saw in the intro, a lot of stuff for the BBC, TV, and radio.

633
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:41,440
I'm now shifting back to doing more research, and apart from coming and giving talks to

634
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:47,040
lovely audiences like you, I'm getting back involved in a lot of this research.

635
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:51,440
So for me, there are two of the big problems we're thinking about.

636
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,120
One is this idea of the era of time.

637
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,120
Where does it come from?

638
00:50:54,120 --> 00:51:00,080
We want the era of time to be defined by entropy being low at the big bang.

639
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:05,720
I want to see if it can emerge dynamically out of our equations of quantum mechanics.

640
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,200
Again, this is not my fault.

641
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:13,240
The organiser said there will be people in the audience who would appreciate a little

642
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,920
bit more technical stuff.

643
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,040
So for most of you who are not physicists, I apologize.

644
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:23,920
I'm doing it to satisfy the geeks out there who might appreciate it.

645
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,440
So when we teach quantum mechanics, we typically teach it as an isolated quantum system.

646
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,440
It's always one-dimensional.

647
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:34,880
It's always square barriers and square wells and stationary states and boring.

648
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,720
No system is isolated, and what we really should be solving is what's called this lovely

649
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,920
thing, the master equation.

650
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,800
So there's lots of ways of writing this.

651
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,800
I've chosen to write it in this form.

652
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,320
The first term, what's called the von Neumann term, if you rub out everything else to the

653
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:54,240
right, that's just another way of writing this Schrodinger equation.

654
00:51:54,240 --> 00:52:00,880
But this new equation tells us that no quantum system behaves by itself.

655
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,960
Everything is entangled with everything else.

656
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,120
Everything is connected with everything else.

657
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,040
So it allows us to study things like entanglement.

658
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:15,440
It allows us to explore the idea of possibly an era of time emerging.

659
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:20,200
Quantum system entangled with its environment, the environment itself, just the surrounding

660
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,640
and atom is measuring it.

661
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:28,880
By measuring it, it gathers information about the system.

662
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,680
And so there's lots of words there in red.

663
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:37,720
I started my search field as a nuclear physics, and I've gradually moved off into a slightly

664
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:38,720
new field.

665
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,720
I'm starting.

666
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:44,200
Finally, you know when you've started to make some progress in a new area of research,

667
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:47,320
when at least you can start to produce papers.

668
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:52,400
So the first authors were my PhD students.

669
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,400
They do the hard work.

670
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:58,080
I just pat them on the head and say, you're doing a very good job.

671
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,040
That's what professors do.

672
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:05,880
But then the other area is this new area of research, which could have been a whole other

673
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:10,560
lecture I could have told you, but I chose to talk about this one.

674
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,760
Quantumologies, the idea of finding quantum effects in living systems.

675
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:18,800
Erwin Schrodinger, back in the mid-40s, wrote this book, What is Life?

676
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:27,400
And he suggests that living systems behave thermodynamically or have a behavior just

677
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,680
like inanimate matter near absolute zero.

678
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:37,640
And we know when inanimate matter is cooled down to near zero Kelvin, it starts to exhibit

679
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:41,880
quantum effects when you can calm down with all the thermodynamics.

680
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:49,080
Schrodinger said in living systems inside a living cell, this ordered structure, it's

681
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:54,920
low entropy, it's behaving like inanimate matter near absolute zero, therefore maybe

682
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:57,080
quantum effects might be involved.

683
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:00,880
It was just an idea, although that was a famous book.

684
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:08,600
Well, a few years ago, 2015, I co-wrote a book called Life on the Edge, which is where

685
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:13,520
we stole the idea for our project title from, with a molecular geneticist, John Joe McFadden,

686
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:18,920
who's a colleague of mine, where we talk about now suddenly there's this new emerging

687
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:22,960
interdisciplinary area of research where we're looking for quantum effects inside living

688
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,440
systems.

689
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:30,200
And the area that I'm most interested in with my collaborators is the idea that you can

690
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,760
see proton tunneling between strands of DNA.

691
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:40,360
So DNA, the double helix, is held together by hydrogen bonds, basically protons.

692
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:45,040
And those protons can jump from one strand to the other.

693
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:49,440
And if they do, that could lead to a mutation.

694
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:56,440
And so it's important to understand genetic mutations if they're caused by proton tunneling.

695
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:03,080
And it's a nice area of research because we're doing theoretical physics, lots of quantum

696
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:08,840
mechanics, we're doing computational chemistry, and we're applying it in biology.

697
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:13,320
So that's the other area of research that I'm involved in.

698
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,360
Good, I have run over time.

699
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,400
I'm very happy to answer questions.

700
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,920
I'll leave you with this.

701
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:22,840
I'm putting this up, not for publicizing, for me, obviously.

702
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:29,720
My publishers asked me to put this up, so I'm only doing as I'm told because it would

703
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,160
be rude not to.

704
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,160
But I will end there.

705
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,440
Thank you very much for your attention.

706
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:39,840
I'm happy to take questions if the organizers believe there's enough time, and happy to

707
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:45,440
answer questions afterwards if you catch me drinking a black hole cocktail after this

708
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,440
talk.

709
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,440
Thank you all very much.

710
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,440
Thank you.

711
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,440
Thank you.

712
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,440
Thank you.

713
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,440
Thank you.

714
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,440
Thank you.

715
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,440
Thank you.

716
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,440
Thank you.

717
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,440
Thank you.

718
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,440
Thank you.

719
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,440
Thank you.

720
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,440
Thank you.

721
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,440
Thank you.

722
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,440
Thank you.
