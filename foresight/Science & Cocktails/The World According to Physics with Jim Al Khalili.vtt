00:00.000 --> 00:21.600
That was a lovely introduction, wasn't it?

00:21.600 --> 00:26.400
It went on a bit too long, but I didn't mind.

00:26.400 --> 00:36.040
This evening I'm going to talk about, I've borrowed from Donald Rumsfeld the subtitle,

00:36.040 --> 00:40.760
because I'm going to talk about essentially the contents of this book, The World According

00:40.760 --> 00:41.760
to Physics.

00:41.760 --> 00:42.760
It's not my most recent book.

00:42.760 --> 00:45.720
I think there may have been some confusion in the blurb.

00:45.720 --> 00:52.480
I had a book came out this year called The Joy of Science, which I was a bit concerned

00:52.480 --> 01:01.560
about because when my publisher, my editor said, great title, it's based on this cookery

01:01.560 --> 01:02.560
book in America.

01:02.560 --> 01:07.200
I forget the name of the author in the 1950s, The Joy of Cooking, and he said, we're calling

01:07.200 --> 01:08.200
it Joy of Science.

01:08.200 --> 01:14.320
I said, you do know there's another book, The Joy of, which begins with an S. That might

01:14.320 --> 01:17.720
help with sales, maybe.

01:17.760 --> 01:23.320
But anyway, I'm talking about, this is the book before last, The World According to Physics.

01:23.320 --> 01:27.040
There are many books, popular science books on physics.

01:27.040 --> 01:33.680
Those of you who read and follow popular science will know that every year there are probably

01:33.680 --> 01:39.840
a dozen or more good books that tell the story of what we understand about the universe and

01:39.840 --> 01:42.720
about reality.

01:42.720 --> 01:47.880
Many of them are very big books, over a thousand pages.

01:47.880 --> 01:48.880
This one is small.

01:48.880 --> 01:49.880
It's almost pocket-sized.

01:49.880 --> 01:58.280
If we think about our knowledge of the physical universe as an island, these books will explore

01:58.280 --> 01:59.280
the whole island.

01:59.280 --> 02:06.280
They will tell the history of how we came to understand what we know, and they try and

02:06.280 --> 02:08.040
cover all aspects.

02:08.040 --> 02:12.320
This book is a walk around the shoreline of the island.

02:12.320 --> 02:18.320
The edges, the limits of what we currently understand, and what there is out there that

02:18.320 --> 02:21.840
we still need to understand.

02:21.840 --> 02:23.240
So I'm going to try and get through.

02:23.240 --> 02:28.680
I'm not going to be able to cover all areas of physics in 50, 45, 50 minutes, because

02:28.680 --> 02:33.920
I want to give some time for questions, but I'll see what I can do.

02:33.920 --> 02:39.760
I want to start with this article by Stephen Hawking.

02:39.760 --> 02:47.840
So this was in 1981, over 40 years ago, predicting the end of theoretical physics.

02:47.840 --> 02:51.600
So he says, in this article, I want to discuss the possibility that the goal of theoretical

02:51.600 --> 02:55.040
physics might be achieved in the not too distant future.

02:55.040 --> 02:58.640
He was talking by the end of the 20th century.

02:58.640 --> 03:04.760
This was just before the big revolution in what we call super string theory, but that

03:04.760 --> 03:11.000
was the mood in theoretical physics in the last few decades of the 20th century.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.840
They felt we're nearly there.

03:12.840 --> 03:19.440
We nearly have a theory of everything, a theory that unifies all the phenomena and the forces

03:19.440 --> 03:28.600
and behavior of the physical universe into one equation you can wear on a t-shirt.

03:29.480 --> 03:37.160
Of course, it reminds us of what physicists thought at the end of the 19th century, because

03:37.160 --> 03:45.440
again, by the 1890s, well, we have electromagnetism, we have Newtonian mechanics, we have thermodynamics

03:45.440 --> 03:48.360
and statistical mechanics.

03:48.360 --> 03:53.240
We know everything, and then they discover the electron, they discover x-rays, they discover

03:53.240 --> 04:00.480
radioactivity, and then Max Planck kicks off the quantum revolution, and Einstein comes

04:00.480 --> 04:01.480
up.

04:01.480 --> 04:08.000
They realized that actually what we thought was the whole, the explanation of everything,

04:08.000 --> 04:11.840
was a long way from what we now understand.

04:11.840 --> 04:18.160
We were a long way from the end, and I would argue that again, we are actually a long way

04:18.160 --> 04:19.160
from the end.

04:19.160 --> 04:21.000
Even Hawking was wrong.

04:21.000 --> 04:28.800
We are not near the end of being able to unify all our theories.

04:28.800 --> 04:36.960
If I think back during my career in physics, what new discoveries, exciting changes, what

04:36.960 --> 04:41.840
is there the equivalent of the discovery of the x-ray and radioactivity and the electron,

04:41.840 --> 04:43.960
the end of the 19th century?

04:43.960 --> 04:53.360
Well, here are two, probably the most popular, famous examples, the conformation, discovery

04:53.360 --> 04:59.200
of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012, and a few years later, the discovery

04:59.200 --> 05:06.000
of the first gravitational waves at these big experimental facilities, the LIGO facilities

05:06.000 --> 05:12.440
in America, both of them quite correctly made headlines around the world.

05:12.440 --> 05:15.600
Everyone was talking about the Higgs boson.

05:15.600 --> 05:19.200
Most people don't understand, even most physicists don't actually understand what the Higgs boson

05:19.200 --> 05:21.320
really is, but it's exciting.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.480
We discovered it.

05:23.480 --> 05:29.960
Discovered gravitational waves, Nobel prizes to everybody.

05:29.960 --> 05:36.280
The problem is, of course, neither of these discoveries was a surprise.

05:36.280 --> 05:40.840
Peter Higgs and others, he wasn't the only one, even though the particle was named after

05:41.360 --> 05:42.360
them.

05:42.360 --> 05:46.040
They had predicted the existence of the Higgs field, the Higgs mechanism and the Higgs

05:46.040 --> 05:54.600
boson back in the 1960s, half a century they had been waiting for the experimental physicists

05:54.600 --> 06:01.960
to build a machine, the Large Hadron Collider, that could create this particle and prove

06:01.960 --> 06:06.160
that their theory was right, but it wasn't a surprise.

06:06.160 --> 06:12.400
The waves even longer, Einstein's general theory of relativity, back over a hundred

06:12.400 --> 06:19.440
years ago, almost exactly a century before the discovery, was predicted.

06:19.440 --> 06:25.160
If general relativity is correct, there should be these gravitational waves from big disturbances

06:25.160 --> 06:29.360
of matter in the universe, sending ripples through space.

06:29.360 --> 06:33.000
So again, tick the box.

06:33.120 --> 06:42.640
It would have been more interesting if we had not found the Higgs boson, not for the

06:42.640 --> 06:47.680
guys who were working at the Large Hadron Collider who had invested their careers, in

06:47.680 --> 06:52.760
it they were very relieved and excited and very happy, but for many other physicists,

06:52.760 --> 06:56.200
it would have been more interesting, actually, if the Higgs boson didn't exist, because

06:56.200 --> 07:01.840
it means there's something missing in our current theories and we need to go back and

07:01.840 --> 07:06.960
think up something new, more Nobel Prizes.

07:06.960 --> 07:16.360
The only real surprise in the last few decades in physics was back in 1998, and that was

07:16.360 --> 07:25.640
a discovery of dark energy, this mysterious force pushing the universe apart, a discovery

07:25.640 --> 07:31.400
by astronomers that the universe is actually expanding faster now than it was in the past.

07:31.400 --> 07:38.160
We've known, until then, until 1998, all the textbooks would say the universe began

07:38.160 --> 07:43.040
with a big bang and it's been expanding, but ever since then, gravity has been slowing

07:43.040 --> 07:45.040
down the expansion.

07:45.040 --> 07:50.400
Everything's pulling everything else together, stopping it from spreading out from each other.

07:50.400 --> 07:56.200
Then in 1998, they discover by looking at the most distant galaxies in the universe that

07:56.280 --> 08:01.480
we can see, they're moving away from us at a speed that suggests that they're moving

08:01.480 --> 08:08.480
away faster, the universe is stretching faster now than it was in the past.

08:08.480 --> 08:12.200
That needed explaining, and it still needs explaining.

08:12.200 --> 08:18.240
This is one example of something that Stephen Hawking, certainly when he wrote that article

08:18.240 --> 08:24.040
in 1981, certainly couldn't have predicted.

08:24.040 --> 08:29.960
By the way, this picture here was produced, I wrote, I don't know if you have it in Denmark,

08:29.960 --> 08:30.960
they're called Ladybird Books.

08:30.960 --> 08:35.640
They're tiny little books where they have one page of text and one page of illustrations,

08:35.640 --> 08:41.400
and they're meant to be for children, but adults like them as well, and it was very

08:41.400 --> 08:42.400
nice.

08:42.400 --> 08:47.480
I wrote a Ladybird book on gravity, and the artist was very talented, so he produced it,

08:47.480 --> 08:52.840
so I had a page talking about dark energy, and he produced this lovely image of something

08:52.840 --> 08:58.200
from Star Wars.

08:58.200 --> 09:02.560
There are things we don't understand, and even now in popular science certainly, but

09:02.560 --> 09:09.200
also in serious physics and cosmology research, there are still questions that we don't know

09:09.200 --> 09:11.240
the answer to, we can't agree on.

09:11.240 --> 09:15.480
Dark energy is one, there's also dark matter, which is a different thing, dark matter is

09:15.480 --> 09:19.160
not the same as dark matter, dark matter we've known about for a long time, but we still

09:19.160 --> 09:22.520
don't know what it is, we don't know what it's made of.

09:22.520 --> 09:27.840
There's also things like the question of the Big Bang itself.

09:27.840 --> 09:34.840
No physicist or astronomer, cosmologist who has studied the subject enough would argue

09:34.840 --> 09:35.920
about the Big Bang.

09:35.920 --> 09:45.880
We all agree our universe started from a very hot, dense initial state, but can we ask the

09:45.880 --> 09:48.880
question what was before the Big Bang?

09:48.880 --> 09:53.840
And when I give talks to school kids, they'll say, yeah, but what made the Big Bang?

09:53.840 --> 09:56.040
What happened before?

09:56.040 --> 10:00.360
If you're religious, if you have religious faith, you say, well, there was some supernatural

10:00.360 --> 10:07.440
divine creator that pushed the button created, and then that explains everything.

10:07.440 --> 10:15.280
But it wasn't even a question that was allowed in science until recent years.

10:15.280 --> 10:18.400
The usual answer was this.

10:18.400 --> 10:23.320
You go back earlier and earlier and earlier in time, the Big Bang is the moment that space

10:23.320 --> 10:26.840
and time themselves were created.

10:26.840 --> 10:31.160
And so it's the same as, so you can't say what was before the Big Bang, because there

10:31.160 --> 10:34.800
was no time to put the word before in.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.480
That was the beginning of time.

10:37.480 --> 10:45.240
It's like, say, walk to the South Pole, and when you reach the South Pole, keep walking

10:45.240 --> 10:46.240
south.

10:46.240 --> 10:49.120
It doesn't make it right.

10:49.120 --> 10:52.160
Every step you take from the South Pole takes you back north again.

10:52.160 --> 10:54.080
It's the further south you can go.

10:54.080 --> 10:59.400
It makes no sense to say what is south of the South Pole without leaving the Earth.

10:59.400 --> 11:04.160
So in a similar way, what is before the Big Bang makes no sense.

11:04.160 --> 11:09.360
Besides that, in recent years, that has also been questioned.

11:09.360 --> 11:14.480
There are ideas in cosmology suggesting maybe there was a before the Big Bang.

11:14.480 --> 11:21.640
In fact, the idea used to be that there was the Big Bang, and then the universe expanded.

11:21.640 --> 11:28.000
Space sort of expanded as time went on, and matter cooled down, and atoms and then stars

11:28.000 --> 11:31.440
were created.

11:32.040 --> 11:37.840
To explain some of the properties of the universe, cosmologists invented this concept

11:37.840 --> 11:43.960
called inflation, where just after the Big Bang, space expanded very, very quickly just

11:43.960 --> 11:47.600
to smooth things out.

11:47.600 --> 11:53.120
We needed that much quicker expansion, just for a tiny fraction of a second, and then

11:53.120 --> 11:56.360
the expansion slowed down to a more normal pace.

11:56.760 --> 12:01.320
Well, of course, now there's another idea that maybe the inflation happened before the

12:01.320 --> 12:03.800
Big Bang.

12:03.800 --> 12:11.400
Maybe our universe is just a bubble in a much bigger, what we regard as the universe is

12:11.400 --> 12:14.920
just a small part of everything, the multiverse.

12:14.920 --> 12:19.360
And maybe the multiverse is constantly undergoing inflation.

12:19.360 --> 12:23.200
In fact, it's called eternal inflation.

12:23.200 --> 12:27.840
And then every now and again, there'll be a bubble appearing in this internal inflation,

12:27.840 --> 12:30.880
and that's a Big Bang of one universe.

12:30.880 --> 12:39.800
And our universe, everything we see, is just one bubble in this multiverse of universes.

12:39.800 --> 12:47.200
So this is another picture from that Lady Bird book, which I quite like, Me Making Bubble

12:47.200 --> 12:48.200
Universes.

12:48.480 --> 12:53.360
Again, I just tell the artists, I say, well, you know, multiverse, bubble universes, and

12:53.360 --> 12:56.120
he says, OK, leave it with me.

12:56.120 --> 13:00.120
I'll do something artistic.

13:00.120 --> 13:09.320
So our journey in terms of what we know now, and we know we haven't reached the end of

13:09.320 --> 13:16.720
the road, has been certainly since the beginning of modern science, since the scientific revolution

13:16.760 --> 13:26.080
in the 16th, 17th centuries, has been a journey of unification, finding different phenomena

13:26.080 --> 13:31.800
and things in the universe to explain, and realizing they're connected with each other,

13:31.800 --> 13:39.480
realizing they're part of some deeper truth that simplifies, I guess, our picture.

13:39.480 --> 13:40.480
So this is a slide.

13:40.480 --> 13:46.160
I'm very happy it's a very big screen, because the fonts I use are quite small, and I fill

13:46.200 --> 13:47.200
it up.

13:47.200 --> 13:51.280
When I'm giving a talk on a small screen, I can't tell the words, so it's good.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.280
You can enjoy it.

13:52.280 --> 13:58.000
OK, so this is the journey through evolution, through unification.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.320
Start off in the top corner.

14:00.320 --> 14:01.320
That's the size.

14:01.320 --> 14:02.320
See?

14:02.320 --> 14:04.400
Now you know what I mean.

14:04.400 --> 14:07.360
I'm going to fill it.

14:07.360 --> 14:14.480
Probably the first, in modern science, the first idea of unifying concepts that were

14:14.480 --> 14:21.080
regarded as being very different was by Isaac Newton, who comes up with his law of gravitation.

14:21.080 --> 14:28.360
He says the apple falling to the ground is experiencing the same force as the force that

14:28.360 --> 14:33.080
keeps the planets in orbit around the sun and the moon in orbit around the earth.

14:33.080 --> 14:38.280
Until then, no one thought that was, why would that be obvious?

14:38.280 --> 14:41.640
The forces of nature governing the heavens should have nothing to do with why.

14:41.640 --> 14:46.160
The apple would prefer to be lower down towards the ground.

14:46.160 --> 14:49.160
So he unified those two ideas.

14:49.160 --> 14:57.880
OK, then 19th century, middle of the 19th century, people like Michael Faraday and James

14:57.880 --> 15:05.240
Clark Maxwell realized that electricity and magnetism, we know what electricity is, we

15:05.240 --> 15:10.760
know what magnetism is, they're actually part of the same, they are described by the

15:10.760 --> 15:16.080
same fundamental force, the electromagnetic force.

15:16.080 --> 15:20.080
So again, we have some unifying ideas.

15:20.080 --> 15:26.120
Then we jump down here, again, 19th century, second half of the 19th century, people, well

15:26.120 --> 15:31.000
throughout the 19th century, people working on the idea of heat and work and energy and

15:31.000 --> 15:34.600
the power of steam and developing engines.

15:34.600 --> 15:40.120
And then that gets unified with an idea called statistical mechanics.

15:40.160 --> 15:43.920
People like Ludwig Boltzmann working on this.

15:43.920 --> 15:49.000
And they are unified today, what we teach to physicists at the university is a subject

15:49.000 --> 15:58.320
called thermodynamics, OK, and it's essentially the idea of heat and temperature and pressure

15:58.320 --> 16:08.520
and how you describe matter at the larger scale in terms of fundamental particles interacting

16:08.520 --> 16:09.520
with each other.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.080
OK, we jump up to here.

16:12.080 --> 16:17.400
No surprises who made the connection between space and time.

16:17.400 --> 16:22.120
That was Einstein in his special theory of relativity in 1905.

16:22.120 --> 16:30.760
Of course, in that same theory, he shows that matter and energy are equivalent, interchangeable.

16:30.760 --> 16:37.960
But we've now hit the 20th century, 10 years after Einstein's special theory of relativity,

16:37.960 --> 16:43.080
he applies it to gravity and replaces Newton's picture of gravity.

16:43.080 --> 16:49.680
He says Newton thought gravity was just this invisible force that pulls objects together.

16:49.680 --> 16:52.440
Einstein says no, it's not a force at all.

16:52.440 --> 16:58.160
Gravity is the shape of space-time, it's geometry.

16:58.160 --> 17:01.800
And in general relativity, to be fair, it's not an easy subject.

17:01.800 --> 17:07.360
It's only taught to students in their last year of university, typically.

17:07.360 --> 17:12.560
Einstein had to go and learn the mathematics before he could develop general relativity.

17:12.560 --> 17:19.520
So that was tough, but it was one of the great triumphs of 20th century physics.

17:19.520 --> 17:25.160
OK, we now jump down to, oh, OK, so general relativity gives us cosmology, and I want

17:25.160 --> 17:28.400
to jump down here, you can see it on the left, atoms.

17:28.400 --> 17:34.680
The existence of atoms wasn't really confirmed until the beginning of the 20th century.

17:34.680 --> 17:41.280
In fact, also due a lot to the work of Einstein.

17:41.280 --> 17:47.600
By the First World War, people like Ernest Rutherford were now being able to see inside

17:47.600 --> 17:48.600
atoms.

17:48.600 --> 17:52.960
They could understand the structure of atoms, and it was made of a nucleus with electrons

17:52.960 --> 17:55.600
going around it.

17:55.600 --> 18:03.600
And then by the 1920s, the early work on quantum theory became quantum mechanics.

18:03.640 --> 18:09.040
And since you are from Copenhagen, you will know that your city played a big role in the

18:09.040 --> 18:16.320
development of quantum mechanics, because Niels Bohr, having worked in the UK, in Cambridge,

18:16.320 --> 18:20.520
in Manchester, he comes back to Copenhagen, he gets money from the Karlsberg Brewery to

18:20.520 --> 18:27.920
build his new institute in 1920, and he brings together the great geniuses of the time, Werner

18:27.920 --> 18:32.800
Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli, Erwin Schrodinger, and Rie Kelsferme.

18:32.920 --> 18:37.840
They are the great names that every physicist admires, that they are our heroes.

18:37.840 --> 18:43.160
They developed quantum mechanics, the theory that describes the subatomic world, the world

18:43.160 --> 18:44.160
of the very small.

18:44.160 --> 18:47.600
General relativity describes the very big, quantum mechanics the very small.

18:47.600 --> 18:51.040
Two very different theories.

18:51.040 --> 18:57.880
By the late 1920s, quantum mechanics and special relativity are joined together, and we have

18:57.880 --> 18:59.640
something called quantum field theory.

19:00.120 --> 19:03.760
Now I'm going to speed up, because I've got to fill up the rest of the screen, and I don't

19:03.760 --> 19:05.120
want to use up all my time.

19:05.120 --> 19:10.760
So, electromagnetism, combined with quantum field theory, gives us something called quantum

19:10.760 --> 19:15.440
electrodynamics, by the middle of the 20th century, people like Richard Feynman have

19:15.440 --> 19:21.960
developed this theory, so you can see lots of words on the left, fewer words as I move

19:21.960 --> 19:24.120
across to the right.

19:24.120 --> 19:29.320
Nuclear physics, we find inside the nucleus two new forces, until then there was gravity

19:29.360 --> 19:32.440
and electromagnetism, just two forces.

19:32.440 --> 19:34.440
Now we discover two new forces.

19:34.440 --> 19:40.240
They have to be explained, they're explained using quantum field theory, so we have something

19:40.240 --> 19:42.640
called quantum chromodynamics.

19:42.640 --> 19:51.040
Quantum chromodynamics and quantum electrodynamics, and the weak force gives us electro-weak theory.

19:51.040 --> 19:56.680
Finally, we combine all the quantum stuff together, and we have what's called the standard

19:56.680 --> 20:02.760
model of particle physics, and at the very top, cosmology, we have the standard model

20:02.760 --> 20:03.920
of cosmology.

20:03.920 --> 20:11.960
Don't worry about the lambda CDM, that's the best we can do to describe the universe

20:11.960 --> 20:18.880
at large, the standard model of particle physics, best we can do to describe the very small.

20:18.880 --> 20:25.800
Of course, standard model of cosmology still has things to be explained, dark matter and

20:25.800 --> 20:29.400
dark energy, we still have to understand them.

20:29.400 --> 20:37.200
But, and this is what Stephen Hawking was hoping for in his comment about the physics

20:37.200 --> 20:38.720
coming to an end.

20:38.720 --> 20:47.560
He was hoping to combine the cosmology and the particle physics together into one theory

20:47.560 --> 20:53.520
of quantum gravity, so quantum gravity is the small connected with the large, sometimes

20:53.520 --> 20:57.280
it's called a theory of everything.

20:57.280 --> 21:02.280
We don't have it yet, which is why I've put a dashed line around it.

21:02.280 --> 21:06.600
This is, we're still looking.

21:06.600 --> 21:11.640
One argument, which I'm actually quite in favour of, is that we're not going to get

21:11.640 --> 21:18.640
a theory of everything unless we bring in that last, that third pillar, thermodynamics

21:18.640 --> 21:21.320
as well.

21:21.400 --> 21:26.280
Maybe there are other areas of physics that are going to have to be involved as well,

21:26.280 --> 21:29.880
so I just wanted to fill up some white spaces.

21:29.880 --> 21:35.200
There's quantum information theory, there's non-linear dynamics, non-equilibrium thermodynamics,

21:35.200 --> 21:39.600
there's the black hole information, which is a whole other lecture, which I'm not going

21:39.600 --> 21:40.840
to go into.

21:40.840 --> 21:48.600
Lots of dashed lines, lots of question marks, we are nowhere near Stephen Hawking's dream

21:48.600 --> 21:51.880
of the end of theoretical physics.

21:51.880 --> 22:00.000
In fact, to show you one other picture from the Lady Bird book, this depicts the struggle

22:00.000 --> 22:06.720
between the two leading, potentially, or have been for some years, leading contenders for

22:06.720 --> 22:14.800
a possible theory of quantum gravity, depicted as superheroes having an arm wrestle.

22:14.880 --> 22:20.720
On the left, there's the string theory that wants to unify the forces of physics.

22:20.720 --> 22:26.360
On the right, there's something called loop quantum gravity that wants to see how space

22:26.360 --> 22:32.720
time itself comes about, how it's created.

22:32.720 --> 22:37.120
There are lots more people working on string theory than loop quantum gravity.

22:37.120 --> 22:42.440
In fact, there have been several books out in recent years criticising string theory,

22:42.480 --> 22:49.880
partly because it hasn't led to the success that people had hoped, but also in part out

22:49.880 --> 22:56.440
of jealousy, because string theory has sucked all the cleverest physicists to work in that

22:56.440 --> 23:01.960
field, and all the other physicists working in other areas, you know, why is string theory

23:01.960 --> 23:06.160
getting all the bright guys?

23:06.600 --> 23:15.920
They haven't had the success that it was hoped they would have 20 or so years ago.

23:15.920 --> 23:25.840
So are we at the stage now where we have to maybe take a step back and try and understand

23:25.840 --> 23:32.240
or re-examine the most basic ideas about reality?

23:32.240 --> 23:35.000
What is space itself?

23:35.000 --> 23:38.200
It's a long argument about whether space is a real thing.

23:38.200 --> 23:45.880
So people like Aristotle and Descartes argued that space isn't real.

23:45.880 --> 23:53.120
It's only defined by being the distance between things or being the volume inside something.

23:53.120 --> 24:00.240
Isaac Newton said, no, space is a thing, space is real, it's the fabric, it's the canvas,

24:00.240 --> 24:06.520
it's the stage on which the universe is built.

24:06.520 --> 24:12.000
Imagine you have an empty box, complete vacuum inside it.

24:12.000 --> 24:17.320
I know in quantum language I should say there's always something, there's always particles

24:17.320 --> 24:23.320
popping in and out of existence, but let's just imagine it's completely just empty space.

24:23.320 --> 24:29.920
Does the box exist if I remove the walls?

24:29.920 --> 24:35.940
Was that space only real because there were walls to define it?

24:35.940 --> 24:42.120
What about if I put the box inside a larger volume, also empty, and now remove the walls

24:42.120 --> 24:45.360
of the inner box?

24:45.360 --> 24:50.880
Is it space now real because it's forming part of the larger volume inside the larger

24:50.880 --> 24:53.320
box?

24:53.320 --> 24:58.480
These are questions that sound trivial, that sound almost childish.

24:58.840 --> 25:03.800
We have figured out what space is.

25:03.800 --> 25:10.280
What the best answer we have so far is what Einstein tells us.

25:10.280 --> 25:14.800
Now Einstein published a book called Relativity, the Special and General Theory.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.880
He published it first in German.

25:16.880 --> 25:22.560
In fact, very soon after he published his work on general relativity, and it's almost

25:22.560 --> 25:24.960
like a popular science book.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.880
It's not a textbook as such.

25:26.880 --> 25:31.200
It was translated into English and other languages.

25:31.200 --> 25:37.880
There were many editions of this book, but usually when a book comes out in new editions,

25:37.880 --> 25:41.360
the author changes some things and updates them.

25:41.360 --> 25:44.680
With this book, Einstein didn't change anything from the original.

25:44.680 --> 25:49.160
He just added appendices at the end.

25:49.160 --> 25:54.160
Appendix number five, the most famous one, appeared the year before he died.

25:54.240 --> 25:57.280
That was the last addition to the book.

25:57.280 --> 26:01.200
In it, he gives a definition of what space is.

26:01.200 --> 26:06.480
He says, if we imagine the gravitational field to remove, we take gravity away.

26:06.480 --> 26:09.800
We take matter and energy away from the universe.

26:09.800 --> 26:11.280
There's no stuff.

26:11.280 --> 26:13.360
Therefore, there's no gravity.

26:13.360 --> 26:18.840
There does not remain any spacetime, but absolutely nothing.

26:18.840 --> 26:25.840
He's saying that Aristotle and Descartes were right, that without matter, without the

26:25.840 --> 26:30.640
walls of the box, there is no spacetime.

26:30.640 --> 26:37.160
He also says, spacetime does not claim existence on its own, but only as a structural quality

26:37.160 --> 26:38.640
of the gravitational field.

26:38.640 --> 26:42.840
You need stuff for space.

26:42.840 --> 26:48.160
In Einstein's language, we have to talk about spacetime to actually exist.

26:48.160 --> 26:55.200
Yet, he also points out that Newton is right, because spacetime is a real thing.

26:55.200 --> 27:01.000
It could be stretched and bent and twisted and warped through the action of gravity.

27:01.000 --> 27:06.080
But for Einstein, spacetime is the gravitational field.

27:06.080 --> 27:12.000
His equations of general relativity is an equation, so it has an equal sign with something

27:12.000 --> 27:14.560
on one side and something on the other.

27:14.560 --> 27:21.000
On one side is matter and energy, mass and energy, and the other side is space and time.

27:21.000 --> 27:28.320
You know from primary school maths with an equal sign, if one side is zero, the other

27:28.320 --> 27:30.720
side is zero as well.

27:30.720 --> 27:31.720
They're equal.

27:31.720 --> 27:35.520
If you take away matter and energy, there's no spacetime.

27:35.520 --> 27:42.400
Take away spacetime, there's no matter and energy.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.800
Is that the end of the story?

27:43.800 --> 27:51.840
Well, no, because one of the things that I've been talking here about general relativity,

27:51.840 --> 27:57.720
I've been missing the other big theory of 20th century physics, which is quantum mechanics.

27:57.720 --> 28:02.800
And the whole point is how do we bring quantum mechanics and general relativity together?

28:02.800 --> 28:05.480
And then the story really changes.

28:05.480 --> 28:10.120
In fact, I've asked what is space.

28:10.120 --> 28:12.400
I might as well ask what is time?

28:12.400 --> 28:20.280
And yeah, there are lots of jokes about what is time, and it's just nature's way of stopping

28:20.280 --> 28:27.000
everything from happening at once is one definition.

28:27.000 --> 28:33.680
But the different areas of physics all give the different pillars of 20th century physics,

28:33.680 --> 28:36.240
all give different definitions of what time is.

28:36.240 --> 28:41.200
So general relativity says time is part of the fabric of the universe.

28:41.200 --> 28:44.160
It's part of spacetime.

28:44.160 --> 28:48.520
It's a dimension that can be stretched and warped.

28:48.520 --> 28:54.080
It's an axis in four dimensions.

28:54.080 --> 28:58.160
Quantum mechanics says time is a parameter, it's just a number.

28:58.160 --> 29:03.160
Number you plug into your equation, you can run the equation forwards, you can run it backwards.

29:03.160 --> 29:07.760
It's no more profound than that.

29:07.760 --> 29:12.600
And then you have thermodynamics, which says no, time isn't a dimension or a number, it's

29:12.600 --> 29:14.160
an arrow.

29:14.160 --> 29:16.280
It points in a certain direction.

29:16.280 --> 29:21.080
It points from past to future.

29:21.080 --> 29:26.680
Until we can reconcile these three ways of thinking about time together, I don't think

29:26.680 --> 29:30.240
we're going to be able to unify physics.

29:30.240 --> 29:38.120
In fact, the search for a theory of everything we talk about unifying general relativity

29:38.120 --> 29:45.080
in quantum mechanics, well, even Einstein himself argued that actually thermodynamics

29:45.080 --> 29:47.560
might be the most important idea.

29:47.560 --> 29:53.360
He says thermodynamics is the only physical theory of universal content, which I'm convinced

29:53.360 --> 29:55.640
would never be overthrown.

29:55.640 --> 29:59.560
But even Einstein's admitting we may have to change general relativity, we may have

29:59.560 --> 30:04.320
to tweak or modify quantum mechanics to get them together.

30:04.320 --> 30:12.800
But thermodynamics, that's sacred in as much as physicists can talk about something as

30:12.800 --> 30:19.000
not open to discussion or debate.

30:19.000 --> 30:24.240
So I want to focus a little bit about this idea of time and this arrow of time.

30:24.360 --> 30:27.840
I want to talk about it a bit because, and I will say at the end of my talk, how am I

30:27.840 --> 30:30.280
doing for talking about time?

30:30.280 --> 30:31.280
Good.

30:31.280 --> 30:35.600
Okay, about 15 minutes, 15 or 20 minutes.

30:35.600 --> 30:40.040
It's the current era of my own research, trying to understand the nature of the direction

30:40.040 --> 30:43.200
of time, why is there a past and a future?

30:43.200 --> 30:48.960
And this goes back to an idea called Loschmitt's Paradox.

30:48.960 --> 30:53.920
We're aware that time has a direction and you might even think that's a trivial, a stupid

30:53.960 --> 30:54.960
question.

30:54.960 --> 31:00.080
Of course time goes from the past to the future because the past happens before the future.

31:00.080 --> 31:02.760
You can't go backwards.

31:02.760 --> 31:10.320
And yet, all the fundamental equations, the dynamical theories of physics, don't care

31:10.320 --> 31:13.280
which direction time goes, forwards or backwards.

31:13.280 --> 31:14.280
They work.

31:14.280 --> 31:19.680
They say the laws of physics are the same in either direction.

31:19.680 --> 31:25.840
Only the second law of thermodynamics is what gives us the arrow of time that says

31:25.840 --> 31:28.920
time has a specific direction.

31:28.920 --> 31:32.680
So think about the orbits of the planets around the sun.

31:32.680 --> 31:37.800
We know they go around the sun anti-clockwise in this picture from looking down from above,

31:37.800 --> 31:42.200
well actually even from below as well.

31:42.200 --> 31:47.000
But if they went around the other way, it wouldn't break any laws of physics.

31:47.000 --> 31:52.280
It could have been possible for them to have gone around the other way.

31:52.280 --> 31:59.920
Particles moving around in a box, that random motion of particles bumping into each other.

31:59.920 --> 32:04.080
If I told you I'm starting to run this film backwards, it wouldn't make any difference

32:04.080 --> 32:05.080
to you.

32:05.080 --> 32:13.560
So describing these phenomena using equations of statistical mechanics or Newtonian mechanics

32:13.560 --> 32:14.560
doesn't matter.

32:14.560 --> 32:18.400
No direction to time.

32:18.400 --> 32:23.160
Particle collisions, this is called a Feynman diagram for those of you who are not familiar

32:23.160 --> 32:24.160
with it.

32:24.160 --> 32:28.200
The arrows show the direction of particles, A and B, coming together.

32:28.200 --> 32:33.120
They feel some force, the dashed line, and then they move apart.

32:33.120 --> 32:40.800
Maybe that force changes those particles into new particles, C and D. But the laws of physics

32:40.800 --> 32:46.360
down at the particle level says well in that case C and D could also come together, interact

32:46.360 --> 32:49.520
and create A and B in the other direction.

32:49.520 --> 32:52.480
That's also possible.

32:52.480 --> 32:58.640
But in our everyday world, we have an hour of time.

32:58.640 --> 33:01.000
We have ice that melts.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.880
It doesn't freeze unless you do something to it.

33:04.880 --> 33:11.720
If you put a glass somewhere and isolated, the ice will eventually melt in the water.

33:11.720 --> 33:14.320
It doesn't go the other way.

33:14.320 --> 33:15.760
Air leaks out at a punctured tire.

33:15.760 --> 33:21.160
It doesn't come back in again if the pressure is different.

33:21.160 --> 33:24.480
An atom or atomic nucleus undergoes radioactive decay.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.640
It spits out alpha particles.

33:26.640 --> 33:33.920
You don't see alpha particles coming from outside, ending up inside a nucleus.

33:33.960 --> 33:36.800
Heat radiates from a hot object.

33:36.800 --> 33:39.400
Objects slow down due to friction.

33:39.400 --> 33:43.720
Chemical reactions very often move only one direction and not in the other.

33:43.720 --> 33:48.160
These things can all happen in reverse, but it's very, very unlikely.

33:48.160 --> 33:51.840
They're all described by the laws of thermodynamics.

33:51.840 --> 33:55.440
This paradox says where does this hour of time come from?

33:55.440 --> 33:58.960
What's its origin?

33:58.960 --> 34:05.720
The usual answer, which cosmologists will tell you, and they have a valid point.

34:05.720 --> 34:13.920
If anyone listens to the podcast Minescape by Sean Carroll, American physicist, very

34:13.920 --> 34:16.560
eloquently explains this standard answer.

34:16.560 --> 34:22.560
It says, well, time flows in the direction of increasing entropy.

34:22.560 --> 34:25.760
Entropy is the amount of disorder.

34:25.760 --> 34:31.720
The amount of information gathered about a system.

34:31.720 --> 34:35.800
Let's keep it to a simple definition.

34:35.800 --> 34:41.560
If I have a pack of cards that is all organized in suits and numbers, 2, 3, 4, 5, all the

34:41.560 --> 34:49.360
way up to an ace in each suit separately, and I shuffle the cards, I'll mix them up.

34:49.360 --> 34:55.520
That is in direction of increasing entropy, the increase of disorder of the cards.

34:55.520 --> 35:02.040
It is possible, by further shuffling, I would get back to the ordered state again, but it's

35:02.040 --> 35:06.840
very, very unlikely, and you can calculate the probability of it, you know, take the

35:06.840 --> 35:13.560
age of, longer than the age of the universe, and I'm just not that patient.

35:13.560 --> 35:15.360
But that's the direction of increasing entropy.

35:15.360 --> 35:20.320
The direction of time is the direction in which cards become more shuffled, more mixed

35:20.320 --> 35:21.320
up.

35:21.320 --> 35:27.400
The direction in which your cream mixes with your coffee, not the opposite.

35:27.400 --> 35:30.360
So you can't run those films backwards.

35:30.360 --> 35:35.040
You would see that there's something wrong, right?

35:35.040 --> 35:37.040
But then why?

35:37.040 --> 35:38.040
Why does entropy increase?

35:38.040 --> 35:42.440
Well, the standard answer is, well, because it was lower in the past.

35:42.440 --> 35:47.080
Okay, well, is that an expression?

35:47.080 --> 35:49.640
Well, why was it lower in the past?

35:49.640 --> 35:51.160
Because it was lower before that.

35:51.160 --> 35:52.160
Why was it before?

35:52.160 --> 35:53.160
Because it was lower.

35:53.160 --> 35:57.840
And you go all the way back, and you say, why does the egg get broken, become an omelet,

35:57.840 --> 36:00.640
and you don't get the other way around?

36:00.640 --> 36:06.800
Because entropy was very low at the Big Bang.

36:06.800 --> 36:13.200
So that's called the past hypothesis.

36:13.200 --> 36:18.800
Some people might find it satisfying, some people might find it mind-blowing, some people

36:18.800 --> 36:21.680
might find it ridiculous.

36:21.680 --> 36:28.840
The reason you can make an omelet that you can't remake an unbroken raw egg from an omelet

36:28.840 --> 36:39.120
is because entropy was low at the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago seems a bit strange.

36:39.120 --> 36:41.680
And I don't think it solves the problem.

36:41.680 --> 36:45.560
So the problem is that all our equations of physics are symmetric in time, right?

36:45.560 --> 36:50.960
So you're given a moment in time, you run into the future and you see how things change.

36:50.960 --> 36:56.920
If you run into the past, there will change in the same symmetric way as they do in the

36:56.920 --> 36:57.920
future.

36:57.920 --> 36:59.800
You can run it forwards and backwards and nothing changes.

36:59.800 --> 37:06.720
Well, all we're doing is saying that special moment, so entropy increases into the future,

37:06.720 --> 37:10.600
but these equations would say, well, entropy will also increase into the past because you

37:10.600 --> 37:13.000
have to have symmetry.

37:13.000 --> 37:19.120
So how do we get rid of this crazy idea that entropy increases in the past?

37:19.120 --> 37:26.400
Move that special now moment, put it right at the beginning, and then only worry about

37:26.400 --> 37:27.800
things happening in the future.

37:27.800 --> 37:32.480
You don't have to worry about the past because there was nothing before the Big Bang.

37:32.480 --> 37:40.840
It seems cheating, which will come at the end to say something about what my current

37:40.840 --> 37:44.760
thinking is on the subject.

37:44.760 --> 37:50.600
I want to say something about, well, this is quantum mechanics, right?

37:50.600 --> 37:55.440
A wave function, cats in boxes, that's all I need to show, quantum mechanics.

37:55.440 --> 38:01.080
Quantum entanglement, as I think you heard in the little intro video, and so I won't

38:01.080 --> 38:07.720
repeat again about Einstein and spookiness because that gets used too often.

38:07.720 --> 38:15.080
The idea is, it used to be a rather strange idea in quantum mechanics, and we wasn't really

38:15.080 --> 38:21.800
taught to students because we didn't think it was important enough that two quantum particles,

38:21.800 --> 38:28.360
like two electrons, could somehow, their fates are intertwined, they're interconnected, that's

38:28.360 --> 38:33.280
such that you can't describe them separately, you have to describe them both together.

38:33.280 --> 38:37.760
And this means if you influence one, if you look at one or change it or measure it, you're

38:37.760 --> 38:42.080
immediately affecting the other one.

38:42.080 --> 38:48.160
We're now beginning to understand that quantum entanglement is actually a profoundly important

38:48.160 --> 38:56.480
idea that may play a role in finding a theory of everything, may play a role in understanding

38:56.480 --> 38:58.160
the era of time.

38:58.160 --> 39:04.120
I want to quickly run through this really nice idea, which I hope is right, but it's

39:04.120 --> 39:07.560
not my idea, right?

39:07.560 --> 39:12.760
But it would be cool if it's correct, but that's not good enough in physics, unfortunately.

39:12.760 --> 39:18.920
Anyway, most famous equation in physics, yeah, boring.

39:18.920 --> 39:21.640
Here's this nice equation.

39:21.640 --> 39:26.440
Some of you may have heard of it, if you're a physicist, you might have heard of it if

39:26.440 --> 39:29.000
you follow popular science.

39:29.000 --> 39:34.200
Usually you see something like this and you think, okay, I know algebra, E cancels with

39:34.200 --> 39:40.640
E, R cancels with R, I don't know, one equals P. Well, that's even more boring than equals

39:40.640 --> 39:41.640
mc squared.

39:41.640 --> 39:43.280
That's not what this is.

39:43.280 --> 39:47.920
You see, this is not an equation.

39:47.920 --> 39:54.840
These letters don't symbolize physical quantities like energy or pressure.

39:54.840 --> 40:05.640
They are the initials of physicists who came up with two very clever ideas.

40:05.640 --> 40:15.240
This is a paper that was published in the 1930s by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, so

40:15.240 --> 40:22.440
E, P, and R, and they were asking a question about this idea about quantum entanglement.

40:22.440 --> 40:37.600
So they were questioning whether quantum mechanics was complete.

40:37.600 --> 40:43.280
They didn't really believe this idea of quantum entanglement.

40:43.280 --> 40:51.920
And so they published this paper in 1935 and gave rise to what we now call the EPR paradox

40:51.920 --> 40:57.400
and I will go through it very, really good to go through the EPR paradox in two minutes.

40:57.400 --> 40:58.400
Let's see.

40:58.400 --> 40:59.400
All right.

40:59.400 --> 41:04.200
Imagine you have a box that can produce two particles, say photons, particles of light

41:04.200 --> 41:06.640
back to back, okay?

41:06.640 --> 41:10.640
They fly out and they reach some distance apart.

41:10.640 --> 41:13.880
I've made them, I've drawn them like this because they're not particles and they're

41:13.880 --> 41:14.880
not waves.

41:14.880 --> 41:20.720
They're some sort of in-between thing, depending on how you look at them.

41:20.720 --> 41:25.520
Then we want to examine photon one.

41:25.520 --> 41:32.360
We take our instrument, our detector, that measures the wavelength of the light.

41:32.360 --> 41:40.000
Now that means it's measuring the energy or the speed of the light.

41:40.000 --> 41:45.600
Tells you where it is, sorry, tells you what its frequency is.

41:45.600 --> 41:52.440
Now that means it's seeing that photon as a wave.

41:52.440 --> 41:55.560
Since the photons came out where they're created from the same source back to back, they're

41:55.560 --> 41:58.560
both traveling, they both have the same energy.

41:58.560 --> 42:07.600
So if we know the wavelength of the light photon one, then that means we also know the

42:07.600 --> 42:08.960
wavelength of photon two.

42:08.960 --> 42:15.440
So without looking at photon two, we can say it has this wavelength.

42:15.440 --> 42:21.920
But we could have chosen to measure the position of photon one.

42:21.920 --> 42:25.280
That means we've now got, we're doing a different experiment.

42:25.280 --> 42:30.000
We now have a detector that doesn't look at the wavelength of photon one, but where it

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
is.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.720
It sort of captures it and finds out exactly what its position is.

42:35.720 --> 42:39.000
So now it's measuring the photon as a particle.

42:39.000 --> 42:44.280
Well, if the photons are both traveling as particles back to back with the same speed,

42:44.280 --> 42:50.040
then photon number two will be the same distance on the other side of the box from photon number

42:50.040 --> 42:51.040
one.

42:51.040 --> 42:56.360
So without looking at photon number two, we can tell you where it is.

42:56.360 --> 43:01.280
Einstein, Podolski and Rosen said, well, that's weird, isn't it?

43:01.280 --> 43:06.800
Sure, photon number one's properties depend on what you measure.

43:06.800 --> 43:09.760
And this is one of the ideas in quantum mechanics.

43:09.760 --> 43:13.600
If you look at wave nature, you find a wave.

43:13.600 --> 43:17.600
If you set up an experiment to find particle nature, you see a particle.

43:17.600 --> 43:22.200
But you can't have something that's both a point particle located somewhere, but at

43:22.200 --> 43:24.520
the same time a spread out wave.

43:24.520 --> 43:27.760
And yet that's what they seem to be saying about photon two.

43:27.760 --> 43:34.680
Without touching it, I could assign to it an exact wavelength, and I could assign to

43:34.680 --> 43:36.760
it an exact position.

43:36.760 --> 43:42.040
Therefore, quantum mechanics, which says this is impossible, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle

43:42.040 --> 43:44.400
and all that business, can't be right.

43:44.400 --> 43:46.380
That was their argument.

43:46.380 --> 43:55.480
But of course, since then, we've realized that photon two knows what you're going to

43:55.600 --> 44:01.640
do to photon one and behaves accordingly, because photon one and photon two are quantum

44:01.640 --> 44:05.640
entangled.

44:05.640 --> 44:12.560
It's physicists tend to be able to get around this with clever language, because the usual

44:12.560 --> 44:20.560
question is how can photon two immediately, instantaneously know what you're doing to

44:20.560 --> 44:21.560
photon one?

44:21.640 --> 44:26.160
Surely this means some instantaneous faster than light connections.

44:26.160 --> 44:29.800
This is what Einstein didn't like.

44:29.800 --> 44:35.360
And physicists say, well, you can't use it to send signals faster than light.

44:35.360 --> 44:40.800
It's only at the quantum level, at the mathematical level, that they are instantaneously connected.

44:40.800 --> 44:43.000
Don't worry about it.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.640
But if they're honest, they are.

44:44.640 --> 44:48.040
These two photons could be on either side of the universe.

44:48.120 --> 44:51.840
And I measure one, and that influences the spin of the other.

44:51.840 --> 44:56.240
I can't predict in advance what it's going to be, because they're subject to quantum

44:56.240 --> 44:58.240
probabilities.

44:58.240 --> 45:05.320
But in recent years, there's been an idea that suggests maybe this can be explained,

45:05.320 --> 45:11.800
because there was, within a few weeks of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen publishing their paper,

45:11.800 --> 45:17.760
two of them, Einstein and Rosen, published another paper in which they were trying to

45:17.760 --> 45:20.760
understand some problem with general relativity.

45:20.760 --> 45:24.560
So not a problem with quantum mechanics, but a problem with the very large.

45:24.560 --> 45:30.280
And the problem there was general relativity predicts the existence of black holes.

45:30.280 --> 45:36.240
And black holes, so the theory in its simplest form suggests, at their center is what's

45:36.240 --> 45:43.840
called the singularity, a point of zero size, an infinite space-time curvature.

45:43.840 --> 45:49.080
And I said, it doesn't like zero size, because that means it has infinite density.

45:49.080 --> 45:57.000
It's like dividing by zero on your calculator, or for young people on your smartphone.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.160
So Einstein and Rosen changed it.

45:59.160 --> 46:02.160
So what if the middle of a black hole isn't a point?

46:02.160 --> 46:09.360
What if it's a tunnel, a bridge, which became known as the Einstein-Rosen bridge?

46:09.360 --> 46:13.120
Those of you who've seen Avengers Endgame, which I rewatched the other day, by the way,

46:13.120 --> 46:15.240
which is why I remember, they talk about it.

46:15.240 --> 46:19.600
Atman says, oh, yes, what you mean, an Einstein-Rosen bridge.

46:19.600 --> 46:27.320
They clearly had spoken to physicists to get the dialogue sounding sciency.

46:27.320 --> 46:33.840
So within a few weeks of each other, Einstein and colleagues, they publish a paper on the

46:33.840 --> 46:40.320
EPR paradox, and they publish another paper on the ER, Einstein-Rosen bridge in general

46:40.320 --> 46:42.200
relativity.

46:42.200 --> 46:48.160
The idea there is that you have, imagine, two points distance in space, A and B. They're

46:48.160 --> 46:55.240
very far, but if space can be bent over, then the distance between them is much smaller.

46:55.240 --> 46:57.600
That's what we now call a wormhole, right?

46:57.600 --> 47:00.880
Okay, so the Einstein-Rosen bridge was the old idea.

47:00.880 --> 47:06.680
Then when people like Kip Thorne, a cosmologist in America, worked on it, it became in popular

47:06.680 --> 47:09.360
culture known as the wormhole.

47:09.360 --> 47:11.360
So here we go.

47:11.400 --> 47:21.080
So in 2013, two American physicists, Juan Maldeseno and Lenny Saskind, published a paper.

47:21.080 --> 47:27.000
You can't tell from the title, cool horizons for entangled black holes exactly what their

47:27.000 --> 47:33.840
trick is, but it's a really neat idea because they bring together those two ideas.

47:33.840 --> 47:39.760
Imagine you have two ends of a wormhole.

47:39.760 --> 47:40.960
These are not two black holes.

47:40.960 --> 47:43.280
If there are black holes, those circles will be black.

47:43.280 --> 47:45.640
There's no light can come out.

47:45.640 --> 47:50.720
But these are meant to be what are called traversable or lorenzian wormholes.

47:50.720 --> 47:55.360
So what you're seeing through this mouth of the wormhole is what the universe looks like

47:55.360 --> 47:58.280
out of the other end, vice versa.

47:58.280 --> 48:00.440
Where is the tunnel between them?

48:00.440 --> 48:05.840
Well, it's outside of our space, so we can't see it.

48:05.840 --> 48:10.000
But we can't see it if we collapse our space into two dimensions.

48:10.000 --> 48:18.760
So if I'm flattened space out, I add some grids just so that it looks physically, alright?

48:18.760 --> 48:22.880
And then we have the wormhole between them.

48:22.880 --> 48:31.920
Saskind and Maldeseno's idea was that what if the two entangled photons in the Ypres

48:31.920 --> 48:32.920
are paradox.

48:32.920 --> 48:40.720
Well, any two entangled particles are in fact only able to communicate seemingly instantaneously

48:40.720 --> 48:44.240
with each other if they're joined by a quantum wormhole.

48:44.240 --> 48:52.560
So the idea is that the reason why entanglement seems so strange is because what we can't

48:52.560 --> 48:58.960
see is that those particles are interconnected by this network of wormholes.

48:58.960 --> 49:00.640
That's the origin of entanglement.

49:01.640 --> 49:09.760
It's a beautiful idea in its simplest form because it says that entanglement is the thread

49:09.760 --> 49:13.440
that produces the fabric of space-time.

49:13.440 --> 49:19.600
Its quantum entanglement is that holds and creates space and time together.

49:19.600 --> 49:27.160
But those are just words and particularly very simplistic words because the theory hasn't

49:27.160 --> 49:30.160
been worked out and evolved completely yet.

49:30.160 --> 49:36.280
But it may be the whole of space-time is really just some quantum foam, lots of wormholes

49:36.280 --> 49:39.600
popping in and out of existence, connecting things together.

49:39.600 --> 49:43.920
I wanted to end very quickly because I've already gone beyond my time and I wanted to

49:43.920 --> 49:44.920
give you a chance for questions.

49:44.920 --> 49:51.160
But I was asked by the organizers to say a little bit about my own current research.

49:51.160 --> 49:56.760
So I'm based at the University of Surrey in Guilford, just south of London, and we set

49:56.760 --> 49:57.760
up a quantum foundation.

49:57.800 --> 50:02.600
So we've got a big research grant from an American foundation called the John Templeton

50:02.600 --> 50:04.200
Foundation.

50:04.200 --> 50:06.800
And we had this really cool title of our project.

50:06.800 --> 50:11.040
We basically said, right, we're going to give you some really, really sexy words, give us

50:11.040 --> 50:12.840
lots of money.

50:12.840 --> 50:18.480
And so we said, life on the edge, quantum, thermo, and quantum energy in the era of time.

50:18.480 --> 50:21.600
But it's a big collaboration.

50:21.600 --> 50:26.000
Six universities are involved in it.

50:26.000 --> 50:30.520
And now I'm finally where, over the last 20 years, I've done a lot of work on broadcasting

50:30.520 --> 50:33.320
as you saw in the intro, a lot of stuff for the BBC, TV, and radio.

50:33.320 --> 50:41.440
I'm now shifting back to doing more research, and apart from coming and giving talks to

50:41.440 --> 50:47.040
lovely audiences like you, I'm getting back involved in a lot of this research.

50:47.040 --> 50:51.440
So for me, there are two of the big problems we're thinking about.

50:51.440 --> 50:53.120
One is this idea of the era of time.

50:53.120 --> 50:54.120
Where does it come from?

50:54.120 --> 51:00.080
We want the era of time to be defined by entropy being low at the big bang.

51:00.080 --> 51:05.720
I want to see if it can emerge dynamically out of our equations of quantum mechanics.

51:05.720 --> 51:08.200
Again, this is not my fault.

51:08.200 --> 51:13.240
The organiser said there will be people in the audience who would appreciate a little

51:13.240 --> 51:14.920
bit more technical stuff.

51:14.920 --> 51:18.040
So for most of you who are not physicists, I apologize.

51:18.040 --> 51:23.920
I'm doing it to satisfy the geeks out there who might appreciate it.

51:23.920 --> 51:28.440
So when we teach quantum mechanics, we typically teach it as an isolated quantum system.

51:28.440 --> 51:29.440
It's always one-dimensional.

51:29.440 --> 51:34.880
It's always square barriers and square wells and stationary states and boring.

51:34.880 --> 51:39.720
No system is isolated, and what we really should be solving is what's called this lovely

51:39.720 --> 51:40.920
thing, the master equation.

51:40.920 --> 51:42.800
So there's lots of ways of writing this.

51:42.800 --> 51:46.800
I've chosen to write it in this form.

51:46.800 --> 51:50.320
The first term, what's called the von Neumann term, if you rub out everything else to the

51:50.320 --> 51:54.240
right, that's just another way of writing this Schrodinger equation.

51:54.240 --> 52:00.880
But this new equation tells us that no quantum system behaves by itself.

52:00.880 --> 52:02.960
Everything is entangled with everything else.

52:02.960 --> 52:05.120
Everything is connected with everything else.

52:05.120 --> 52:08.040
So it allows us to study things like entanglement.

52:08.040 --> 52:15.440
It allows us to explore the idea of possibly an era of time emerging.

52:15.440 --> 52:20.200
Quantum system entangled with its environment, the environment itself, just the surrounding

52:20.960 --> 52:23.640
and atom is measuring it.

52:23.640 --> 52:28.880
By measuring it, it gathers information about the system.

52:28.880 --> 52:32.680
And so there's lots of words there in red.

52:32.680 --> 52:37.720
I started my search field as a nuclear physics, and I've gradually moved off into a slightly

52:37.720 --> 52:38.720
new field.

52:38.720 --> 52:39.720
I'm starting.

52:39.720 --> 52:44.200
Finally, you know when you've started to make some progress in a new area of research,

52:44.200 --> 52:47.320
when at least you can start to produce papers.

52:47.320 --> 52:52.400
So the first authors were my PhD students.

52:52.400 --> 52:53.400
They do the hard work.

52:53.400 --> 52:58.080
I just pat them on the head and say, you're doing a very good job.

52:58.080 --> 53:01.040
That's what professors do.

53:01.040 --> 53:05.880
But then the other area is this new area of research, which could have been a whole other

53:05.880 --> 53:10.560
lecture I could have told you, but I chose to talk about this one.

53:10.560 --> 53:13.760
Quantumologies, the idea of finding quantum effects in living systems.

53:14.160 --> 53:18.800
Erwin Schrodinger, back in the mid-40s, wrote this book, What is Life?

53:18.800 --> 53:27.400
And he suggests that living systems behave thermodynamically or have a behavior just

53:27.400 --> 53:30.680
like inanimate matter near absolute zero.

53:30.680 --> 53:37.640
And we know when inanimate matter is cooled down to near zero Kelvin, it starts to exhibit

53:37.640 --> 53:41.880
quantum effects when you can calm down with all the thermodynamics.

53:42.440 --> 53:49.080
Schrodinger said in living systems inside a living cell, this ordered structure, it's

53:49.080 --> 53:54.920
low entropy, it's behaving like inanimate matter near absolute zero, therefore maybe

53:54.920 --> 53:57.080
quantum effects might be involved.

53:57.080 --> 54:00.880
It was just an idea, although that was a famous book.

54:00.880 --> 54:08.600
Well, a few years ago, 2015, I co-wrote a book called Life on the Edge, which is where

54:08.640 --> 54:13.520
we stole the idea for our project title from, with a molecular geneticist, John Joe McFadden,

54:13.520 --> 54:18.920
who's a colleague of mine, where we talk about now suddenly there's this new emerging

54:18.920 --> 54:22.960
interdisciplinary area of research where we're looking for quantum effects inside living

54:22.960 --> 54:24.440
systems.

54:24.440 --> 54:30.200
And the area that I'm most interested in with my collaborators is the idea that you can

54:30.200 --> 54:33.760
see proton tunneling between strands of DNA.

54:33.800 --> 54:40.360
So DNA, the double helix, is held together by hydrogen bonds, basically protons.

54:40.360 --> 54:45.040
And those protons can jump from one strand to the other.

54:45.040 --> 54:49.440
And if they do, that could lead to a mutation.

54:49.440 --> 54:56.440
And so it's important to understand genetic mutations if they're caused by proton tunneling.

54:56.440 --> 55:03.080
And it's a nice area of research because we're doing theoretical physics, lots of quantum

55:03.080 --> 55:08.840
mechanics, we're doing computational chemistry, and we're applying it in biology.

55:08.840 --> 55:13.320
So that's the other area of research that I'm involved in.

55:13.320 --> 55:15.360
Good, I have run over time.

55:15.360 --> 55:17.400
I'm very happy to answer questions.

55:17.400 --> 55:18.920
I'll leave you with this.

55:18.920 --> 55:22.840
I'm putting this up, not for publicizing, for me, obviously.

55:22.840 --> 55:29.720
My publishers asked me to put this up, so I'm only doing as I'm told because it would

55:29.720 --> 55:31.160
be rude not to.

55:31.160 --> 55:33.160
But I will end there.

55:33.160 --> 55:34.440
Thank you very much for your attention.

55:34.440 --> 55:39.840
I'm happy to take questions if the organizers believe there's enough time, and happy to

55:39.840 --> 55:45.440
answer questions afterwards if you catch me drinking a black hole cocktail after this

55:45.440 --> 55:46.440
talk.

55:46.440 --> 55:47.440
Thank you all very much.

55:47.440 --> 55:48.440
Thank you.

55:48.440 --> 55:49.440
Thank you.

55:49.440 --> 55:50.440
Thank you.

55:50.440 --> 55:51.440
Thank you.

55:51.440 --> 55:52.440
Thank you.

55:52.440 --> 55:53.440
Thank you.

55:53.440 --> 55:54.440
Thank you.

55:54.440 --> 55:55.440
Thank you.

55:55.440 --> 55:56.440
Thank you.

55:56.440 --> 55:57.440
Thank you.

55:57.440 --> 55:58.440
Thank you.

55:58.440 --> 55:59.440
Thank you.

55:59.440 --> 56:00.440
Thank you.
