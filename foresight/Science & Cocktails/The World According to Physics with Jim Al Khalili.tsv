0	21600	That was a lovely introduction, wasn't it?
21600	26400	It went on a bit too long, but I didn't mind.
26400	36040	This evening I'm going to talk about, I've borrowed from Donald Rumsfeld the subtitle,
36040	40760	because I'm going to talk about essentially the contents of this book, The World According
40760	41760	to Physics.
41760	42760	It's not my most recent book.
42760	45720	I think there may have been some confusion in the blurb.
45720	52480	I had a book came out this year called The Joy of Science, which I was a bit concerned
52480	61560	about because when my publisher, my editor said, great title, it's based on this cookery
61560	62560	book in America.
62560	67200	I forget the name of the author in the 1950s, The Joy of Cooking, and he said, we're calling
67200	68200	it Joy of Science.
68200	74320	I said, you do know there's another book, The Joy of, which begins with an S. That might
74320	77720	help with sales, maybe.
77760	83320	But anyway, I'm talking about, this is the book before last, The World According to Physics.
83320	87040	There are many books, popular science books on physics.
87040	93680	Those of you who read and follow popular science will know that every year there are probably
93680	99840	a dozen or more good books that tell the story of what we understand about the universe and
99840	102720	about reality.
102720	107880	Many of them are very big books, over a thousand pages.
107880	108880	This one is small.
108880	109880	It's almost pocket-sized.
109880	118280	If we think about our knowledge of the physical universe as an island, these books will explore
118280	119280	the whole island.
119280	126280	They will tell the history of how we came to understand what we know, and they try and
126280	128040	cover all aspects.
128040	132320	This book is a walk around the shoreline of the island.
132320	138320	The edges, the limits of what we currently understand, and what there is out there that
138320	141840	we still need to understand.
141840	143240	So I'm going to try and get through.
143240	148680	I'm not going to be able to cover all areas of physics in 50, 45, 50 minutes, because
148680	153920	I want to give some time for questions, but I'll see what I can do.
153920	159760	I want to start with this article by Stephen Hawking.
159760	167840	So this was in 1981, over 40 years ago, predicting the end of theoretical physics.
167840	171600	So he says, in this article, I want to discuss the possibility that the goal of theoretical
171600	175040	physics might be achieved in the not too distant future.
175040	178640	He was talking by the end of the 20th century.
178640	184760	This was just before the big revolution in what we call super string theory, but that
184760	191000	was the mood in theoretical physics in the last few decades of the 20th century.
191000	192840	They felt we're nearly there.
192840	199440	We nearly have a theory of everything, a theory that unifies all the phenomena and the forces
199440	208600	and behavior of the physical universe into one equation you can wear on a t-shirt.
209480	217160	Of course, it reminds us of what physicists thought at the end of the 19th century, because
217160	225440	again, by the 1890s, well, we have electromagnetism, we have Newtonian mechanics, we have thermodynamics
225440	228360	and statistical mechanics.
228360	233240	We know everything, and then they discover the electron, they discover x-rays, they discover
233240	240480	radioactivity, and then Max Planck kicks off the quantum revolution, and Einstein comes
240480	241480	up.
241480	248000	They realized that actually what we thought was the whole, the explanation of everything,
248000	251840	was a long way from what we now understand.
251840	258160	We were a long way from the end, and I would argue that again, we are actually a long way
258160	259160	from the end.
259160	261000	Even Hawking was wrong.
261000	268800	We are not near the end of being able to unify all our theories.
268800	276960	If I think back during my career in physics, what new discoveries, exciting changes, what
276960	281840	is there the equivalent of the discovery of the x-ray and radioactivity and the electron,
281840	283960	the end of the 19th century?
283960	293360	Well, here are two, probably the most popular, famous examples, the conformation, discovery
293360	299200	of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012, and a few years later, the discovery
299200	306000	of the first gravitational waves at these big experimental facilities, the LIGO facilities
306000	312440	in America, both of them quite correctly made headlines around the world.
312440	315600	Everyone was talking about the Higgs boson.
315600	319200	Most people don't understand, even most physicists don't actually understand what the Higgs boson
319200	321320	really is, but it's exciting.
321320	323480	We discovered it.
323480	329960	Discovered gravitational waves, Nobel prizes to everybody.
329960	336280	The problem is, of course, neither of these discoveries was a surprise.
336280	340840	Peter Higgs and others, he wasn't the only one, even though the particle was named after
341360	342360	them.
342360	346040	They had predicted the existence of the Higgs field, the Higgs mechanism and the Higgs
346040	354600	boson back in the 1960s, half a century they had been waiting for the experimental physicists
354600	361960	to build a machine, the Large Hadron Collider, that could create this particle and prove
361960	366160	that their theory was right, but it wasn't a surprise.
366160	372400	The waves even longer, Einstein's general theory of relativity, back over a hundred
372400	379440	years ago, almost exactly a century before the discovery, was predicted.
379440	385160	If general relativity is correct, there should be these gravitational waves from big disturbances
385160	389360	of matter in the universe, sending ripples through space.
389360	393000	So again, tick the box.
393120	402640	It would have been more interesting if we had not found the Higgs boson, not for the
402640	407680	guys who were working at the Large Hadron Collider who had invested their careers, in
407680	412760	it they were very relieved and excited and very happy, but for many other physicists,
412760	416200	it would have been more interesting, actually, if the Higgs boson didn't exist, because
416200	421840	it means there's something missing in our current theories and we need to go back and
421840	426960	think up something new, more Nobel Prizes.
426960	436360	The only real surprise in the last few decades in physics was back in 1998, and that was
436360	445640	a discovery of dark energy, this mysterious force pushing the universe apart, a discovery
445640	451400	by astronomers that the universe is actually expanding faster now than it was in the past.
451400	458160	We've known, until then, until 1998, all the textbooks would say the universe began
458160	463040	with a big bang and it's been expanding, but ever since then, gravity has been slowing
463040	465040	down the expansion.
465040	470400	Everything's pulling everything else together, stopping it from spreading out from each other.
470400	476200	Then in 1998, they discover by looking at the most distant galaxies in the universe that
476280	481480	we can see, they're moving away from us at a speed that suggests that they're moving
481480	488480	away faster, the universe is stretching faster now than it was in the past.
488480	492200	That needed explaining, and it still needs explaining.
492200	498240	This is one example of something that Stephen Hawking, certainly when he wrote that article
498240	504040	in 1981, certainly couldn't have predicted.
504040	509960	By the way, this picture here was produced, I wrote, I don't know if you have it in Denmark,
509960	510960	they're called Ladybird Books.
510960	515640	They're tiny little books where they have one page of text and one page of illustrations,
515640	521400	and they're meant to be for children, but adults like them as well, and it was very
521400	522400	nice.
522400	527480	I wrote a Ladybird book on gravity, and the artist was very talented, so he produced it,
527480	532840	so I had a page talking about dark energy, and he produced this lovely image of something
532840	538200	from Star Wars.
538200	542560	There are things we don't understand, and even now in popular science certainly, but
542560	549200	also in serious physics and cosmology research, there are still questions that we don't know
549200	551240	the answer to, we can't agree on.
551240	555480	Dark energy is one, there's also dark matter, which is a different thing, dark matter is
555480	559160	not the same as dark matter, dark matter we've known about for a long time, but we still
559160	562520	don't know what it is, we don't know what it's made of.
562520	567840	There's also things like the question of the Big Bang itself.
567840	574840	No physicist or astronomer, cosmologist who has studied the subject enough would argue
574840	575920	about the Big Bang.
575920	585880	We all agree our universe started from a very hot, dense initial state, but can we ask the
585880	588880	question what was before the Big Bang?
588880	593840	And when I give talks to school kids, they'll say, yeah, but what made the Big Bang?
593840	596040	What happened before?
596040	600360	If you're religious, if you have religious faith, you say, well, there was some supernatural
600360	607440	divine creator that pushed the button created, and then that explains everything.
607440	615280	But it wasn't even a question that was allowed in science until recent years.
615280	618400	The usual answer was this.
618400	623320	You go back earlier and earlier and earlier in time, the Big Bang is the moment that space
623320	626840	and time themselves were created.
626840	631160	And so it's the same as, so you can't say what was before the Big Bang, because there
631160	634800	was no time to put the word before in.
634800	637480	That was the beginning of time.
637480	645240	It's like, say, walk to the South Pole, and when you reach the South Pole, keep walking
645240	646240	south.
646240	649120	It doesn't make it right.
649120	652160	Every step you take from the South Pole takes you back north again.
652160	654080	It's the further south you can go.
654080	659400	It makes no sense to say what is south of the South Pole without leaving the Earth.
659400	664160	So in a similar way, what is before the Big Bang makes no sense.
664160	669360	Besides that, in recent years, that has also been questioned.
669360	674480	There are ideas in cosmology suggesting maybe there was a before the Big Bang.
674480	681640	In fact, the idea used to be that there was the Big Bang, and then the universe expanded.
681640	688000	Space sort of expanded as time went on, and matter cooled down, and atoms and then stars
688000	691440	were created.
692040	697840	To explain some of the properties of the universe, cosmologists invented this concept
697840	703960	called inflation, where just after the Big Bang, space expanded very, very quickly just
703960	707600	to smooth things out.
707600	713120	We needed that much quicker expansion, just for a tiny fraction of a second, and then
713120	716360	the expansion slowed down to a more normal pace.
716760	721320	Well, of course, now there's another idea that maybe the inflation happened before the
721320	723800	Big Bang.
723800	731400	Maybe our universe is just a bubble in a much bigger, what we regard as the universe is
731400	734920	just a small part of everything, the multiverse.
734920	739360	And maybe the multiverse is constantly undergoing inflation.
739360	743200	In fact, it's called eternal inflation.
743200	747840	And then every now and again, there'll be a bubble appearing in this internal inflation,
747840	750880	and that's a Big Bang of one universe.
750880	759800	And our universe, everything we see, is just one bubble in this multiverse of universes.
759800	767200	So this is another picture from that Lady Bird book, which I quite like, Me Making Bubble
767200	768200	Universes.
768480	773360	Again, I just tell the artists, I say, well, you know, multiverse, bubble universes, and
773360	776120	he says, OK, leave it with me.
776120	780120	I'll do something artistic.
780120	789320	So our journey in terms of what we know now, and we know we haven't reached the end of
789320	796720	the road, has been certainly since the beginning of modern science, since the scientific revolution
796760	806080	in the 16th, 17th centuries, has been a journey of unification, finding different phenomena
806080	811800	and things in the universe to explain, and realizing they're connected with each other,
811800	819480	realizing they're part of some deeper truth that simplifies, I guess, our picture.
819480	820480	So this is a slide.
820480	826160	I'm very happy it's a very big screen, because the fonts I use are quite small, and I fill
826200	827200	it up.
827200	831280	When I'm giving a talk on a small screen, I can't tell the words, so it's good.
831280	832280	You can enjoy it.
832280	838000	OK, so this is the journey through evolution, through unification.
838000	840320	Start off in the top corner.
840320	841320	That's the size.
841320	842320	See?
842320	844400	Now you know what I mean.
844400	847360	I'm going to fill it.
847360	854480	Probably the first, in modern science, the first idea of unifying concepts that were
854480	861080	regarded as being very different was by Isaac Newton, who comes up with his law of gravitation.
861080	868360	He says the apple falling to the ground is experiencing the same force as the force that
868360	873080	keeps the planets in orbit around the sun and the moon in orbit around the earth.
873080	878280	Until then, no one thought that was, why would that be obvious?
878280	881640	The forces of nature governing the heavens should have nothing to do with why.
881640	886160	The apple would prefer to be lower down towards the ground.
886160	889160	So he unified those two ideas.
889160	897880	OK, then 19th century, middle of the 19th century, people like Michael Faraday and James
897880	905240	Clark Maxwell realized that electricity and magnetism, we know what electricity is, we
905240	910760	know what magnetism is, they're actually part of the same, they are described by the
910760	916080	same fundamental force, the electromagnetic force.
916080	920080	So again, we have some unifying ideas.
920080	926120	Then we jump down here, again, 19th century, second half of the 19th century, people, well
926120	931000	throughout the 19th century, people working on the idea of heat and work and energy and
931000	934600	the power of steam and developing engines.
934600	940120	And then that gets unified with an idea called statistical mechanics.
940160	943920	People like Ludwig Boltzmann working on this.
943920	949000	And they are unified today, what we teach to physicists at the university is a subject
949000	958320	called thermodynamics, OK, and it's essentially the idea of heat and temperature and pressure
958320	968520	and how you describe matter at the larger scale in terms of fundamental particles interacting
968520	969520	with each other.
969520	972080	OK, we jump up to here.
972080	977400	No surprises who made the connection between space and time.
977400	982120	That was Einstein in his special theory of relativity in 1905.
982120	990760	Of course, in that same theory, he shows that matter and energy are equivalent, interchangeable.
990760	997960	But we've now hit the 20th century, 10 years after Einstein's special theory of relativity,
997960	1003080	he applies it to gravity and replaces Newton's picture of gravity.
1003080	1009680	He says Newton thought gravity was just this invisible force that pulls objects together.
1009680	1012440	Einstein says no, it's not a force at all.
1012440	1018160	Gravity is the shape of space-time, it's geometry.
1018160	1021800	And in general relativity, to be fair, it's not an easy subject.
1021800	1027360	It's only taught to students in their last year of university, typically.
1027360	1032560	Einstein had to go and learn the mathematics before he could develop general relativity.
1032560	1039520	So that was tough, but it was one of the great triumphs of 20th century physics.
1039520	1045160	OK, we now jump down to, oh, OK, so general relativity gives us cosmology, and I want
1045160	1048400	to jump down here, you can see it on the left, atoms.
1048400	1054680	The existence of atoms wasn't really confirmed until the beginning of the 20th century.
1054680	1061280	In fact, also due a lot to the work of Einstein.
1061280	1067600	By the First World War, people like Ernest Rutherford were now being able to see inside
1067600	1068600	atoms.
1068600	1072960	They could understand the structure of atoms, and it was made of a nucleus with electrons
1072960	1075600	going around it.
1075600	1083600	And then by the 1920s, the early work on quantum theory became quantum mechanics.
1083640	1089040	And since you are from Copenhagen, you will know that your city played a big role in the
1089040	1096320	development of quantum mechanics, because Niels Bohr, having worked in the UK, in Cambridge,
1096320	1100520	in Manchester, he comes back to Copenhagen, he gets money from the Karlsberg Brewery to
1100520	1107920	build his new institute in 1920, and he brings together the great geniuses of the time, Werner
1107920	1112800	Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli, Erwin Schrodinger, and Rie Kelsferme.
1112920	1117840	They are the great names that every physicist admires, that they are our heroes.
1117840	1123160	They developed quantum mechanics, the theory that describes the subatomic world, the world
1123160	1124160	of the very small.
1124160	1127600	General relativity describes the very big, quantum mechanics the very small.
1127600	1131040	Two very different theories.
1131040	1137880	By the late 1920s, quantum mechanics and special relativity are joined together, and we have
1137880	1139640	something called quantum field theory.
1140120	1143760	Now I'm going to speed up, because I've got to fill up the rest of the screen, and I don't
1143760	1145120	want to use up all my time.
1145120	1150760	So, electromagnetism, combined with quantum field theory, gives us something called quantum
1150760	1155440	electrodynamics, by the middle of the 20th century, people like Richard Feynman have
1155440	1161960	developed this theory, so you can see lots of words on the left, fewer words as I move
1161960	1164120	across to the right.
1164120	1169320	Nuclear physics, we find inside the nucleus two new forces, until then there was gravity
1169360	1172440	and electromagnetism, just two forces.
1172440	1174440	Now we discover two new forces.
1174440	1180240	They have to be explained, they're explained using quantum field theory, so we have something
1180240	1182640	called quantum chromodynamics.
1182640	1191040	Quantum chromodynamics and quantum electrodynamics, and the weak force gives us electro-weak theory.
1191040	1196680	Finally, we combine all the quantum stuff together, and we have what's called the standard
1196680	1202760	model of particle physics, and at the very top, cosmology, we have the standard model
1202760	1203920	of cosmology.
1203920	1211960	Don't worry about the lambda CDM, that's the best we can do to describe the universe
1211960	1218880	at large, the standard model of particle physics, best we can do to describe the very small.
1218880	1225800	Of course, standard model of cosmology still has things to be explained, dark matter and
1225800	1229400	dark energy, we still have to understand them.
1229400	1237200	But, and this is what Stephen Hawking was hoping for in his comment about the physics
1237200	1238720	coming to an end.
1238720	1247560	He was hoping to combine the cosmology and the particle physics together into one theory
1247560	1253520	of quantum gravity, so quantum gravity is the small connected with the large, sometimes
1253520	1257280	it's called a theory of everything.
1257280	1262280	We don't have it yet, which is why I've put a dashed line around it.
1262280	1266600	This is, we're still looking.
1266600	1271640	One argument, which I'm actually quite in favour of, is that we're not going to get
1271640	1278640	a theory of everything unless we bring in that last, that third pillar, thermodynamics
1278640	1281320	as well.
1281400	1286280	Maybe there are other areas of physics that are going to have to be involved as well,
1286280	1289880	so I just wanted to fill up some white spaces.
1289880	1295200	There's quantum information theory, there's non-linear dynamics, non-equilibrium thermodynamics,
1295200	1299600	there's the black hole information, which is a whole other lecture, which I'm not going
1299600	1300840	to go into.
1300840	1308600	Lots of dashed lines, lots of question marks, we are nowhere near Stephen Hawking's dream
1308600	1311880	of the end of theoretical physics.
1311880	1320000	In fact, to show you one other picture from the Lady Bird book, this depicts the struggle
1320000	1326720	between the two leading, potentially, or have been for some years, leading contenders for
1326720	1334800	a possible theory of quantum gravity, depicted as superheroes having an arm wrestle.
1334880	1340720	On the left, there's the string theory that wants to unify the forces of physics.
1340720	1346360	On the right, there's something called loop quantum gravity that wants to see how space
1346360	1352720	time itself comes about, how it's created.
1352720	1357120	There are lots more people working on string theory than loop quantum gravity.
1357120	1362440	In fact, there have been several books out in recent years criticising string theory,
1362480	1369880	partly because it hasn't led to the success that people had hoped, but also in part out
1369880	1376440	of jealousy, because string theory has sucked all the cleverest physicists to work in that
1376440	1381960	field, and all the other physicists working in other areas, you know, why is string theory
1381960	1386160	getting all the bright guys?
1386600	1395920	They haven't had the success that it was hoped they would have 20 or so years ago.
1395920	1405840	So are we at the stage now where we have to maybe take a step back and try and understand
1405840	1412240	or re-examine the most basic ideas about reality?
1412240	1415000	What is space itself?
1415000	1418200	It's a long argument about whether space is a real thing.
1418200	1425880	So people like Aristotle and Descartes argued that space isn't real.
1425880	1433120	It's only defined by being the distance between things or being the volume inside something.
1433120	1440240	Isaac Newton said, no, space is a thing, space is real, it's the fabric, it's the canvas,
1440240	1446520	it's the stage on which the universe is built.
1446520	1452000	Imagine you have an empty box, complete vacuum inside it.
1452000	1457320	I know in quantum language I should say there's always something, there's always particles
1457320	1463320	popping in and out of existence, but let's just imagine it's completely just empty space.
1463320	1469920	Does the box exist if I remove the walls?
1469920	1475940	Was that space only real because there were walls to define it?
1475940	1482120	What about if I put the box inside a larger volume, also empty, and now remove the walls
1482120	1485360	of the inner box?
1485360	1490880	Is it space now real because it's forming part of the larger volume inside the larger
1490880	1493320	box?
1493320	1498480	These are questions that sound trivial, that sound almost childish.
1498840	1503800	We have figured out what space is.
1503800	1510280	What the best answer we have so far is what Einstein tells us.
1510280	1514800	Now Einstein published a book called Relativity, the Special and General Theory.
1514800	1516880	He published it first in German.
1516880	1522560	In fact, very soon after he published his work on general relativity, and it's almost
1522560	1524960	like a popular science book.
1524960	1526880	It's not a textbook as such.
1526880	1531200	It was translated into English and other languages.
1531200	1537880	There were many editions of this book, but usually when a book comes out in new editions,
1537880	1541360	the author changes some things and updates them.
1541360	1544680	With this book, Einstein didn't change anything from the original.
1544680	1549160	He just added appendices at the end.
1549160	1554160	Appendix number five, the most famous one, appeared the year before he died.
1554240	1557280	That was the last addition to the book.
1557280	1561200	In it, he gives a definition of what space is.
1561200	1566480	He says, if we imagine the gravitational field to remove, we take gravity away.
1566480	1569800	We take matter and energy away from the universe.
1569800	1571280	There's no stuff.
1571280	1573360	Therefore, there's no gravity.
1573360	1578840	There does not remain any spacetime, but absolutely nothing.
1578840	1585840	He's saying that Aristotle and Descartes were right, that without matter, without the
1585840	1590640	walls of the box, there is no spacetime.
1590640	1597160	He also says, spacetime does not claim existence on its own, but only as a structural quality
1597160	1598640	of the gravitational field.
1598640	1602840	You need stuff for space.
1602840	1608160	In Einstein's language, we have to talk about spacetime to actually exist.
1608160	1615200	Yet, he also points out that Newton is right, because spacetime is a real thing.
1615200	1621000	It could be stretched and bent and twisted and warped through the action of gravity.
1621000	1626080	But for Einstein, spacetime is the gravitational field.
1626080	1632000	His equations of general relativity is an equation, so it has an equal sign with something
1632000	1634560	on one side and something on the other.
1634560	1641000	On one side is matter and energy, mass and energy, and the other side is space and time.
1641000	1648320	You know from primary school maths with an equal sign, if one side is zero, the other
1648320	1650720	side is zero as well.
1650720	1651720	They're equal.
1651720	1655520	If you take away matter and energy, there's no spacetime.
1655520	1662400	Take away spacetime, there's no matter and energy.
1662400	1663800	Is that the end of the story?
1663800	1671840	Well, no, because one of the things that I've been talking here about general relativity,
1671840	1677720	I've been missing the other big theory of 20th century physics, which is quantum mechanics.
1677720	1682800	And the whole point is how do we bring quantum mechanics and general relativity together?
1682800	1685480	And then the story really changes.
1685480	1690120	In fact, I've asked what is space.
1690120	1692400	I might as well ask what is time?
1692400	1700280	And yeah, there are lots of jokes about what is time, and it's just nature's way of stopping
1700280	1707000	everything from happening at once is one definition.
1707000	1713680	But the different areas of physics all give the different pillars of 20th century physics,
1713680	1716240	all give different definitions of what time is.
1716240	1721200	So general relativity says time is part of the fabric of the universe.
1721200	1724160	It's part of spacetime.
1724160	1728520	It's a dimension that can be stretched and warped.
1728520	1734080	It's an axis in four dimensions.
1734080	1738160	Quantum mechanics says time is a parameter, it's just a number.
1738160	1743160	Number you plug into your equation, you can run the equation forwards, you can run it backwards.
1743160	1747760	It's no more profound than that.
1747760	1752600	And then you have thermodynamics, which says no, time isn't a dimension or a number, it's
1752600	1754160	an arrow.
1754160	1756280	It points in a certain direction.
1756280	1761080	It points from past to future.
1761080	1766680	Until we can reconcile these three ways of thinking about time together, I don't think
1766680	1770240	we're going to be able to unify physics.
1770240	1778120	In fact, the search for a theory of everything we talk about unifying general relativity
1778120	1785080	in quantum mechanics, well, even Einstein himself argued that actually thermodynamics
1785080	1787560	might be the most important idea.
1787560	1793360	He says thermodynamics is the only physical theory of universal content, which I'm convinced
1793360	1795640	would never be overthrown.
1795640	1799560	But even Einstein's admitting we may have to change general relativity, we may have
1799560	1804320	to tweak or modify quantum mechanics to get them together.
1804320	1812800	But thermodynamics, that's sacred in as much as physicists can talk about something as
1812800	1819000	not open to discussion or debate.
1819000	1824240	So I want to focus a little bit about this idea of time and this arrow of time.
1824360	1827840	I want to talk about it a bit because, and I will say at the end of my talk, how am I
1827840	1830280	doing for talking about time?
1830280	1831280	Good.
1831280	1835600	Okay, about 15 minutes, 15 or 20 minutes.
1835600	1840040	It's the current era of my own research, trying to understand the nature of the direction
1840040	1843200	of time, why is there a past and a future?
1843200	1848960	And this goes back to an idea called Loschmitt's Paradox.
1848960	1853920	We're aware that time has a direction and you might even think that's a trivial, a stupid
1853960	1854960	question.
1854960	1860080	Of course time goes from the past to the future because the past happens before the future.
1860080	1862760	You can't go backwards.
1862760	1870320	And yet, all the fundamental equations, the dynamical theories of physics, don't care
1870320	1873280	which direction time goes, forwards or backwards.
1873280	1874280	They work.
1874280	1879680	They say the laws of physics are the same in either direction.
1879680	1885840	Only the second law of thermodynamics is what gives us the arrow of time that says
1885840	1888920	time has a specific direction.
1888920	1892680	So think about the orbits of the planets around the sun.
1892680	1897800	We know they go around the sun anti-clockwise in this picture from looking down from above,
1897800	1902200	well actually even from below as well.
1902200	1907000	But if they went around the other way, it wouldn't break any laws of physics.
1907000	1912280	It could have been possible for them to have gone around the other way.
1912280	1919920	Particles moving around in a box, that random motion of particles bumping into each other.
1919920	1924080	If I told you I'm starting to run this film backwards, it wouldn't make any difference
1924080	1925080	to you.
1925080	1933560	So describing these phenomena using equations of statistical mechanics or Newtonian mechanics
1933560	1934560	doesn't matter.
1934560	1938400	No direction to time.
1938400	1943160	Particle collisions, this is called a Feynman diagram for those of you who are not familiar
1943160	1944160	with it.
1944160	1948200	The arrows show the direction of particles, A and B, coming together.
1948200	1953120	They feel some force, the dashed line, and then they move apart.
1953120	1960800	Maybe that force changes those particles into new particles, C and D. But the laws of physics
1960800	1966360	down at the particle level says well in that case C and D could also come together, interact
1966360	1969520	and create A and B in the other direction.
1969520	1972480	That's also possible.
1972480	1978640	But in our everyday world, we have an hour of time.
1978640	1981000	We have ice that melts.
1981000	1984880	It doesn't freeze unless you do something to it.
1984880	1991720	If you put a glass somewhere and isolated, the ice will eventually melt in the water.
1991720	1994320	It doesn't go the other way.
1994320	1995760	Air leaks out at a punctured tire.
1995760	2001160	It doesn't come back in again if the pressure is different.
2001160	2004480	An atom or atomic nucleus undergoes radioactive decay.
2004480	2006640	It spits out alpha particles.
2006640	2013920	You don't see alpha particles coming from outside, ending up inside a nucleus.
2013960	2016800	Heat radiates from a hot object.
2016800	2019400	Objects slow down due to friction.
2019400	2023720	Chemical reactions very often move only one direction and not in the other.
2023720	2028160	These things can all happen in reverse, but it's very, very unlikely.
2028160	2031840	They're all described by the laws of thermodynamics.
2031840	2035440	This paradox says where does this hour of time come from?
2035440	2038960	What's its origin?
2038960	2045720	The usual answer, which cosmologists will tell you, and they have a valid point.
2045720	2053920	If anyone listens to the podcast Minescape by Sean Carroll, American physicist, very
2053920	2056560	eloquently explains this standard answer.
2056560	2062560	It says, well, time flows in the direction of increasing entropy.
2062560	2065760	Entropy is the amount of disorder.
2065760	2071720	The amount of information gathered about a system.
2071720	2075800	Let's keep it to a simple definition.
2075800	2081560	If I have a pack of cards that is all organized in suits and numbers, 2, 3, 4, 5, all the
2081560	2089360	way up to an ace in each suit separately, and I shuffle the cards, I'll mix them up.
2089360	2095520	That is in direction of increasing entropy, the increase of disorder of the cards.
2095520	2102040	It is possible, by further shuffling, I would get back to the ordered state again, but it's
2102040	2106840	very, very unlikely, and you can calculate the probability of it, you know, take the
2106840	2113560	age of, longer than the age of the universe, and I'm just not that patient.
2113560	2115360	But that's the direction of increasing entropy.
2115360	2120320	The direction of time is the direction in which cards become more shuffled, more mixed
2120320	2121320	up.
2121320	2127400	The direction in which your cream mixes with your coffee, not the opposite.
2127400	2130360	So you can't run those films backwards.
2130360	2135040	You would see that there's something wrong, right?
2135040	2137040	But then why?
2137040	2138040	Why does entropy increase?
2138040	2142440	Well, the standard answer is, well, because it was lower in the past.
2142440	2147080	Okay, well, is that an expression?
2147080	2149640	Well, why was it lower in the past?
2149640	2151160	Because it was lower before that.
2151160	2152160	Why was it before?
2152160	2153160	Because it was lower.
2153160	2157840	And you go all the way back, and you say, why does the egg get broken, become an omelet,
2157840	2160640	and you don't get the other way around?
2160640	2166800	Because entropy was very low at the Big Bang.
2166800	2173200	So that's called the past hypothesis.
2173200	2178800	Some people might find it satisfying, some people might find it mind-blowing, some people
2178800	2181680	might find it ridiculous.
2181680	2188840	The reason you can make an omelet that you can't remake an unbroken raw egg from an omelet
2188840	2199120	is because entropy was low at the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago seems a bit strange.
2199120	2201680	And I don't think it solves the problem.
2201680	2205560	So the problem is that all our equations of physics are symmetric in time, right?
2205560	2210960	So you're given a moment in time, you run into the future and you see how things change.
2210960	2216920	If you run into the past, there will change in the same symmetric way as they do in the
2216920	2217920	future.
2217920	2219800	You can run it forwards and backwards and nothing changes.
2219800	2226720	Well, all we're doing is saying that special moment, so entropy increases into the future,
2226720	2230600	but these equations would say, well, entropy will also increase into the past because you
2230600	2233000	have to have symmetry.
2233000	2239120	So how do we get rid of this crazy idea that entropy increases in the past?
2239120	2246400	Move that special now moment, put it right at the beginning, and then only worry about
2246400	2247800	things happening in the future.
2247800	2252480	You don't have to worry about the past because there was nothing before the Big Bang.
2252480	2260840	It seems cheating, which will come at the end to say something about what my current
2260840	2264760	thinking is on the subject.
2264760	2270600	I want to say something about, well, this is quantum mechanics, right?
2270600	2275440	A wave function, cats in boxes, that's all I need to show, quantum mechanics.
2275440	2281080	Quantum entanglement, as I think you heard in the little intro video, and so I won't
2281080	2287720	repeat again about Einstein and spookiness because that gets used too often.
2287720	2295080	The idea is, it used to be a rather strange idea in quantum mechanics, and we wasn't really
2295080	2301800	taught to students because we didn't think it was important enough that two quantum particles,
2301800	2308360	like two electrons, could somehow, their fates are intertwined, they're interconnected, that's
2308360	2313280	such that you can't describe them separately, you have to describe them both together.
2313280	2317760	And this means if you influence one, if you look at one or change it or measure it, you're
2317760	2322080	immediately affecting the other one.
2322080	2328160	We're now beginning to understand that quantum entanglement is actually a profoundly important
2328160	2336480	idea that may play a role in finding a theory of everything, may play a role in understanding
2336480	2338160	the era of time.
2338160	2344120	I want to quickly run through this really nice idea, which I hope is right, but it's
2344120	2347560	not my idea, right?
2347560	2352760	But it would be cool if it's correct, but that's not good enough in physics, unfortunately.
2352760	2358920	Anyway, most famous equation in physics, yeah, boring.
2358920	2361640	Here's this nice equation.
2361640	2366440	Some of you may have heard of it, if you're a physicist, you might have heard of it if
2366440	2369000	you follow popular science.
2369000	2374200	Usually you see something like this and you think, okay, I know algebra, E cancels with
2374200	2380640	E, R cancels with R, I don't know, one equals P. Well, that's even more boring than equals
2380640	2381640	mc squared.
2381640	2383280	That's not what this is.
2383280	2387920	You see, this is not an equation.
2387920	2394840	These letters don't symbolize physical quantities like energy or pressure.
2394840	2405640	They are the initials of physicists who came up with two very clever ideas.
2405640	2415240	This is a paper that was published in the 1930s by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, so
2415240	2422440	E, P, and R, and they were asking a question about this idea about quantum entanglement.
2422440	2437600	So they were questioning whether quantum mechanics was complete.
2437600	2443280	They didn't really believe this idea of quantum entanglement.
2443280	2451920	And so they published this paper in 1935 and gave rise to what we now call the EPR paradox
2451920	2457400	and I will go through it very, really good to go through the EPR paradox in two minutes.
2457400	2458400	Let's see.
2458400	2459400	All right.
2459400	2464200	Imagine you have a box that can produce two particles, say photons, particles of light
2464200	2466640	back to back, okay?
2466640	2470640	They fly out and they reach some distance apart.
2470640	2473880	I've made them, I've drawn them like this because they're not particles and they're
2473880	2474880	not waves.
2474880	2480720	They're some sort of in-between thing, depending on how you look at them.
2480720	2485520	Then we want to examine photon one.
2485520	2492360	We take our instrument, our detector, that measures the wavelength of the light.
2492360	2500000	Now that means it's measuring the energy or the speed of the light.
2500000	2505600	Tells you where it is, sorry, tells you what its frequency is.
2505600	2512440	Now that means it's seeing that photon as a wave.
2512440	2515560	Since the photons came out where they're created from the same source back to back, they're
2515560	2518560	both traveling, they both have the same energy.
2518560	2527600	So if we know the wavelength of the light photon one, then that means we also know the
2527600	2528960	wavelength of photon two.
2528960	2535440	So without looking at photon two, we can say it has this wavelength.
2535440	2541920	But we could have chosen to measure the position of photon one.
2541920	2545280	That means we've now got, we're doing a different experiment.
2545280	2550000	We now have a detector that doesn't look at the wavelength of photon one, but where it
2550000	2551000	is.
2551000	2555720	It sort of captures it and finds out exactly what its position is.
2555720	2559000	So now it's measuring the photon as a particle.
2559000	2564280	Well, if the photons are both traveling as particles back to back with the same speed,
2564280	2570040	then photon number two will be the same distance on the other side of the box from photon number
2570040	2571040	one.
2571040	2576360	So without looking at photon number two, we can tell you where it is.
2576360	2581280	Einstein, Podolski and Rosen said, well, that's weird, isn't it?
2581280	2586800	Sure, photon number one's properties depend on what you measure.
2586800	2589760	And this is one of the ideas in quantum mechanics.
2589760	2593600	If you look at wave nature, you find a wave.
2593600	2597600	If you set up an experiment to find particle nature, you see a particle.
2597600	2602200	But you can't have something that's both a point particle located somewhere, but at
2602200	2604520	the same time a spread out wave.
2604520	2607760	And yet that's what they seem to be saying about photon two.
2607760	2614680	Without touching it, I could assign to it an exact wavelength, and I could assign to
2614680	2616760	it an exact position.
2616760	2622040	Therefore, quantum mechanics, which says this is impossible, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle
2622040	2624400	and all that business, can't be right.
2624400	2626380	That was their argument.
2626380	2635480	But of course, since then, we've realized that photon two knows what you're going to
2635600	2641640	do to photon one and behaves accordingly, because photon one and photon two are quantum
2641640	2645640	entangled.
2645640	2652560	It's physicists tend to be able to get around this with clever language, because the usual
2652560	2660560	question is how can photon two immediately, instantaneously know what you're doing to
2660560	2661560	photon one?
2661640	2666160	Surely this means some instantaneous faster than light connections.
2666160	2669800	This is what Einstein didn't like.
2669800	2675360	And physicists say, well, you can't use it to send signals faster than light.
2675360	2680800	It's only at the quantum level, at the mathematical level, that they are instantaneously connected.
2680800	2683000	Don't worry about it.
2683000	2684640	But if they're honest, they are.
2684640	2688040	These two photons could be on either side of the universe.
2688120	2691840	And I measure one, and that influences the spin of the other.
2691840	2696240	I can't predict in advance what it's going to be, because they're subject to quantum
2696240	2698240	probabilities.
2698240	2705320	But in recent years, there's been an idea that suggests maybe this can be explained,
2705320	2711800	because there was, within a few weeks of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen publishing their paper,
2711800	2717760	two of them, Einstein and Rosen, published another paper in which they were trying to
2717760	2720760	understand some problem with general relativity.
2720760	2724560	So not a problem with quantum mechanics, but a problem with the very large.
2724560	2730280	And the problem there was general relativity predicts the existence of black holes.
2730280	2736240	And black holes, so the theory in its simplest form suggests, at their center is what's
2736240	2743840	called the singularity, a point of zero size, an infinite space-time curvature.
2743840	2749080	And I said, it doesn't like zero size, because that means it has infinite density.
2749080	2757000	It's like dividing by zero on your calculator, or for young people on your smartphone.
2757000	2759160	So Einstein and Rosen changed it.
2759160	2762160	So what if the middle of a black hole isn't a point?
2762160	2769360	What if it's a tunnel, a bridge, which became known as the Einstein-Rosen bridge?
2769360	2773120	Those of you who've seen Avengers Endgame, which I rewatched the other day, by the way,
2773120	2775240	which is why I remember, they talk about it.
2775240	2779600	Atman says, oh, yes, what you mean, an Einstein-Rosen bridge.
2779600	2787320	They clearly had spoken to physicists to get the dialogue sounding sciency.
2787320	2793840	So within a few weeks of each other, Einstein and colleagues, they publish a paper on the
2793840	2800320	EPR paradox, and they publish another paper on the ER, Einstein-Rosen bridge in general
2800320	2802200	relativity.
2802200	2808160	The idea there is that you have, imagine, two points distance in space, A and B. They're
2808160	2815240	very far, but if space can be bent over, then the distance between them is much smaller.
2815240	2817600	That's what we now call a wormhole, right?
2817600	2820880	Okay, so the Einstein-Rosen bridge was the old idea.
2820880	2826680	Then when people like Kip Thorne, a cosmologist in America, worked on it, it became in popular
2826680	2829360	culture known as the wormhole.
2829360	2831360	So here we go.
2831400	2841080	So in 2013, two American physicists, Juan Maldeseno and Lenny Saskind, published a paper.
2841080	2847000	You can't tell from the title, cool horizons for entangled black holes exactly what their
2847000	2853840	trick is, but it's a really neat idea because they bring together those two ideas.
2853840	2859760	Imagine you have two ends of a wormhole.
2859760	2860960	These are not two black holes.
2860960	2863280	If there are black holes, those circles will be black.
2863280	2865640	There's no light can come out.
2865640	2870720	But these are meant to be what are called traversable or lorenzian wormholes.
2870720	2875360	So what you're seeing through this mouth of the wormhole is what the universe looks like
2875360	2878280	out of the other end, vice versa.
2878280	2880440	Where is the tunnel between them?
2880440	2885840	Well, it's outside of our space, so we can't see it.
2885840	2890000	But we can't see it if we collapse our space into two dimensions.
2890000	2898760	So if I'm flattened space out, I add some grids just so that it looks physically, alright?
2898760	2902880	And then we have the wormhole between them.
2902880	2911920	Saskind and Maldeseno's idea was that what if the two entangled photons in the Ypres
2911920	2912920	are paradox.
2912920	2920720	Well, any two entangled particles are in fact only able to communicate seemingly instantaneously
2920720	2924240	with each other if they're joined by a quantum wormhole.
2924240	2932560	So the idea is that the reason why entanglement seems so strange is because what we can't
2932560	2938960	see is that those particles are interconnected by this network of wormholes.
2938960	2940640	That's the origin of entanglement.
2941640	2949760	It's a beautiful idea in its simplest form because it says that entanglement is the thread
2949760	2953440	that produces the fabric of space-time.
2953440	2959600	Its quantum entanglement is that holds and creates space and time together.
2959600	2967160	But those are just words and particularly very simplistic words because the theory hasn't
2967160	2970160	been worked out and evolved completely yet.
2970160	2976280	But it may be the whole of space-time is really just some quantum foam, lots of wormholes
2976280	2979600	popping in and out of existence, connecting things together.
2979600	2983920	I wanted to end very quickly because I've already gone beyond my time and I wanted to
2983920	2984920	give you a chance for questions.
2984920	2991160	But I was asked by the organizers to say a little bit about my own current research.
2991160	2996760	So I'm based at the University of Surrey in Guilford, just south of London, and we set
2996760	2997760	up a quantum foundation.
2997800	3002600	So we've got a big research grant from an American foundation called the John Templeton
3002600	3004200	Foundation.
3004200	3006800	And we had this really cool title of our project.
3006800	3011040	We basically said, right, we're going to give you some really, really sexy words, give us
3011040	3012840	lots of money.
3012840	3018480	And so we said, life on the edge, quantum, thermo, and quantum energy in the era of time.
3018480	3021600	But it's a big collaboration.
3021600	3026000	Six universities are involved in it.
3026000	3030520	And now I'm finally where, over the last 20 years, I've done a lot of work on broadcasting
3030520	3033320	as you saw in the intro, a lot of stuff for the BBC, TV, and radio.
3033320	3041440	I'm now shifting back to doing more research, and apart from coming and giving talks to
3041440	3047040	lovely audiences like you, I'm getting back involved in a lot of this research.
3047040	3051440	So for me, there are two of the big problems we're thinking about.
3051440	3053120	One is this idea of the era of time.
3053120	3054120	Where does it come from?
3054120	3060080	We want the era of time to be defined by entropy being low at the big bang.
3060080	3065720	I want to see if it can emerge dynamically out of our equations of quantum mechanics.
3065720	3068200	Again, this is not my fault.
3068200	3073240	The organiser said there will be people in the audience who would appreciate a little
3073240	3074920	bit more technical stuff.
3074920	3078040	So for most of you who are not physicists, I apologize.
3078040	3083920	I'm doing it to satisfy the geeks out there who might appreciate it.
3083920	3088440	So when we teach quantum mechanics, we typically teach it as an isolated quantum system.
3088440	3089440	It's always one-dimensional.
3089440	3094880	It's always square barriers and square wells and stationary states and boring.
3094880	3099720	No system is isolated, and what we really should be solving is what's called this lovely
3099720	3100920	thing, the master equation.
3100920	3102800	So there's lots of ways of writing this.
3102800	3106800	I've chosen to write it in this form.
3106800	3110320	The first term, what's called the von Neumann term, if you rub out everything else to the
3110320	3114240	right, that's just another way of writing this Schrodinger equation.
3114240	3120880	But this new equation tells us that no quantum system behaves by itself.
3120880	3122960	Everything is entangled with everything else.
3122960	3125120	Everything is connected with everything else.
3125120	3128040	So it allows us to study things like entanglement.
3128040	3135440	It allows us to explore the idea of possibly an era of time emerging.
3135440	3140200	Quantum system entangled with its environment, the environment itself, just the surrounding
3140960	3143640	and atom is measuring it.
3143640	3148880	By measuring it, it gathers information about the system.
3148880	3152680	And so there's lots of words there in red.
3152680	3157720	I started my search field as a nuclear physics, and I've gradually moved off into a slightly
3157720	3158720	new field.
3158720	3159720	I'm starting.
3159720	3164200	Finally, you know when you've started to make some progress in a new area of research,
3164200	3167320	when at least you can start to produce papers.
3167320	3172400	So the first authors were my PhD students.
3172400	3173400	They do the hard work.
3173400	3178080	I just pat them on the head and say, you're doing a very good job.
3178080	3181040	That's what professors do.
3181040	3185880	But then the other area is this new area of research, which could have been a whole other
3185880	3190560	lecture I could have told you, but I chose to talk about this one.
3190560	3193760	Quantumologies, the idea of finding quantum effects in living systems.
3194160	3198800	Erwin Schrodinger, back in the mid-40s, wrote this book, What is Life?
3198800	3207400	And he suggests that living systems behave thermodynamically or have a behavior just
3207400	3210680	like inanimate matter near absolute zero.
3210680	3217640	And we know when inanimate matter is cooled down to near zero Kelvin, it starts to exhibit
3217640	3221880	quantum effects when you can calm down with all the thermodynamics.
3222440	3229080	Schrodinger said in living systems inside a living cell, this ordered structure, it's
3229080	3234920	low entropy, it's behaving like inanimate matter near absolute zero, therefore maybe
3234920	3237080	quantum effects might be involved.
3237080	3240880	It was just an idea, although that was a famous book.
3240880	3248600	Well, a few years ago, 2015, I co-wrote a book called Life on the Edge, which is where
3248640	3253520	we stole the idea for our project title from, with a molecular geneticist, John Joe McFadden,
3253520	3258920	who's a colleague of mine, where we talk about now suddenly there's this new emerging
3258920	3262960	interdisciplinary area of research where we're looking for quantum effects inside living
3262960	3264440	systems.
3264440	3270200	And the area that I'm most interested in with my collaborators is the idea that you can
3270200	3273760	see proton tunneling between strands of DNA.
3273800	3280360	So DNA, the double helix, is held together by hydrogen bonds, basically protons.
3280360	3285040	And those protons can jump from one strand to the other.
3285040	3289440	And if they do, that could lead to a mutation.
3289440	3296440	And so it's important to understand genetic mutations if they're caused by proton tunneling.
3296440	3303080	And it's a nice area of research because we're doing theoretical physics, lots of quantum
3303080	3308840	mechanics, we're doing computational chemistry, and we're applying it in biology.
3308840	3313320	So that's the other area of research that I'm involved in.
3313320	3315360	Good, I have run over time.
3315360	3317400	I'm very happy to answer questions.
3317400	3318920	I'll leave you with this.
3318920	3322840	I'm putting this up, not for publicizing, for me, obviously.
3322840	3329720	My publishers asked me to put this up, so I'm only doing as I'm told because it would
3329720	3331160	be rude not to.
3331160	3333160	But I will end there.
3333160	3334440	Thank you very much for your attention.
3334440	3339840	I'm happy to take questions if the organizers believe there's enough time, and happy to
3339840	3345440	answer questions afterwards if you catch me drinking a black hole cocktail after this
3345440	3346440	talk.
3346440	3347440	Thank you all very much.
3347440	3348440	Thank you.
3348440	3349440	Thank you.
3349440	3350440	Thank you.
3350440	3351440	Thank you.
3351440	3352440	Thank you.
3352440	3353440	Thank you.
3353440	3354440	Thank you.
3354440	3355440	Thank you.
3355440	3356440	Thank you.
3356440	3357440	Thank you.
3357440	3358440	Thank you.
3358440	3359440	Thank you.
3359440	3360440	Thank you.
