1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
about that shortly.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,280
So we have one more speaker before lunch,

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,200
and it is Professor James McClurkin.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,600
He is the Professor of Computer Science at Rice University

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,360
and a leading expert in swarm robotics.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,880
From 1999 to 2003, he was the lead research scientist

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,360
at iRobot, where he managed the DARPA-funded swarm project.

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,440
In 2003, as a PhD candidate at MIT,

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,120
he won the Lemelson-MIT Prize for Student Invention.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,800
Professor McClurkin's research is inspired

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,440
by the behavior of ants, bees, wasps, and termites.

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,200
He develops distributed algorithms

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,360
that allow cheap robots to exhibit

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,680
similarly advanced group behaviors,

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,600
including exploration and even dynamic task assignment.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,120
He is here to explain how multi-robot systems offer

17
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,840
faster and cheaper solutions for many problems,

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,560
and he has brought some robots along for a live demo.

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,160
Please welcome Professor James McClurkin.

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,920
Thank you.

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,920
Good morning, everyone.

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,800
I have the honor of standing between you and lunch,

23
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,520
so I'll do my best to keep my remarks efficient

24
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,760
and as interesting as possible.

25
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,440
So we talked about swarm robots,

26
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,560
and I've got this talk divided into three acts.

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,520
For Act 1, let's get into the robot revolution.

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,440
As the slide already says, it has already begun,

29
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,200
and it is televised.

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,920
Here's the Roomba.

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,080
They sold 3 million of these.

32
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,320
It's a fantastic little robot.

33
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,880
It runs around to clean your floors.

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,280
It does it all the way you're not home.

35
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,400
Does it do as well as you do with a vacuum?

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,440
No, but you don't have to push it.

37
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,400
Honda's Asimov, arguably the most advanced human robot

38
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,760
on the planet, just in case you're

39
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,800
wondering if it's Asimov right there in the middle.

40
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,280
And the job of Asimov is to help people.

41
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,720
So we've spent the last 10,000 years

42
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,800
building a human-sized and human-shaped world,

43
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,640
so we need a robot that can go out there

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,400
and work with us in our own place.

45
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,240
The Packbot.

46
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,600
This is by iRobot.

47
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,120
And if you're these two warfighters,

48
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,680
do you want to go into this cave or send the robot in?

49
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,200
Well, that's easy.

50
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,320
iRobot builds them, sends them out like that.

51
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,960
Sometimes they come back like that.

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,680
And regardless of your views of our current foreign policy,

53
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,800
what we're doing overseas, or any of this stuff

54
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,800
that's going on with our military,

55
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,800
this is far better than the alternative.

56
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,480
And the postcard says, iRobot, thank you for all of your support.

57
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,560
You have saved lives today.

58
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,640
So these are the three Ds of robotics.

59
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,720
These are tasks that are dangerous, dirty, and dull.

60
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,280
And you can figure out which ones are which

61
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,400
based on the images if you want.

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,000
But I argue that there's a fourth D.

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
There's a fourth D of robotics that is distributed.

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And I think the next generation of robotics,

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,040
the future of a futuristic field,

66
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,000
is distributed systems, robots that can go and work together

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,360
and do so in very large populations.

68
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,280
Here's my favorite current example.

69
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,800
And this is Kiva Systems.

70
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,600
This is one of their warehouse setups.

71
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,520
And they have huge populations of robots that work together.

72
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,960
They're not quite fully distributed,

73
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,440
but they do have some local autonomy.

74
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,440
There's a big giant centralized controller

75
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,840
that tells them what to do.

76
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,560
And the number of robots have let them fundamentally

77
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,360
transform the warehouse to distribute some problem.

78
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,000
You don't need to have pickers and placers

79
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,520
to pick stuff off of the shelves.

80
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,000
The shelves come to you.

81
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,480
You have humans on the periphery of the warehouse.

82
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,280
Big 18-wheelers come in on one side

83
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,280
loaded with one set of goods, a big truck of staples,

84
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,520
a big truck of pencils, a big truck of pens to show up.

85
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,600
Robots wheel up.

86
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,280
They line up.

87
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,080
People put the things onto the carts.

88
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,880
The robots go somewhere.

89
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,160
No one cares.

90
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,720
On the other side of the warehouse,

91
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,040
small trucks show up for individual stores.

92
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,520
The robots again line up from somewhere.

93
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,280
No one cares.

94
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,000
And the humans can put the stuff onto the small trucks.

95
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,680
All the while, the inventory is actually moving and marching

96
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,680
around the warehouse.

97
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,000
If you need to move to a bigger warehouse,

98
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,160
you just build a ramp between them.

99
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,640
I think Staples did this.

100
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,360
And the robots march up to your new place.

101
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,720
Fantastic stuff.

102
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,400
So transforming the problem through large populations

103
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,200
is what I'm really thinking about.

104
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,000
So imagine if a forest fire.

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,280
We just had a bunch in Texas.

106
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,640
What if you had 20 robots to look for hotspots

107
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,960
in this forest fire?

108
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,280
This could prevent flare-ups from happening behind your

109
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,840
fire fires.

110
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,920
This would be fantastic.

111
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,640
Earthquakes.

112
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,840
Here's a job that humans are uniquely ill-suited to do.

113
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,560
We're either too big to get into either the rubble

114
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,200
or we're too weak to lift the rubble off

115
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,560
if we find a survivor.

116
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,720
So I imagine for this, I have 200 here.

117
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,840
I should change the slide.

118
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,560
I imagine a whole ecosystem of robots.

119
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,360
I imagine maybe 20,000 cockroach-sized robots who

120
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,960
can look for signs of life.

121
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,400
They then relay their findings through their cockroach

122
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,880
radio network to a bunch of rat-sized robots who

123
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,480
are structural engineers.

124
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,600
This is New York City, so we got serious rats here.

125
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,480
And these robots then can solve the reverse Junker problem,

126
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,640
figuring out how to excrete this person stately.

127
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,440
They've got blueprints.

128
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,280
They know where the signs could have occurred.

129
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,480
They can solve this problem.

130
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,160
They then relay their instructions to a bunch of

131
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,040
brontosaurus-sized heavy-litters who can then go in and do

132
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,520
the reverse Junker problem of getting the person out.

133
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,200
So this would be a fantastic thing for robots to do.

134
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,720
One of my favorite applications, though, is sending

135
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,240
robots to other planets.

136
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,760
So right now, we have two robots in Mars.

137
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,560
Or we had two robots in Mars.

138
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,360
Next slide, please.

139
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,560
What if we had 2,000?

140
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,080
And it might look something like this.

141
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,600
So here's my demo.

142
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,680
And I have to start the demo in the way that you need to

143
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,360
never start a demo by begging forgiveness, because the

144
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,320
house Wi-Fi is really powerful.

145
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,680
My robots are less so.

146
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,000
OK, so here is my robots.

147
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,240
They have just landed on Mars.

148
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,360
For this demo, there's going to be a human in charge of the

149
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,240
swarm, me, namely.

150
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,080
And the first thing you need to do is get the robots away

151
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,760
from the landing site.

152
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,720
So I'm going to ask this one to lead its colleagues out into

153
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,120
the wild red yonder.

154
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:08,480
I think they're saying down in front.

155
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,160
So the problem is that I need to carry this guy around,

156
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,360
because I've only got about two feet of range because of

157
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,160
the Wi-Fi system.

158
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,760
But let's all imagine that we have a nice, smooth follow

159
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,240
the leader going on.

160
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,600
I've never done this for my knees before.

161
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,280
This is really kind of fun.

162
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,640
The robots themselves talk to each other using infrared

163
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,320
light.

164
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,000
So if I can get them into a happy configuration, they can

165
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,480
take care of themselves.

166
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,760
And that's what I'm going to try to do.

167
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,080
This, of course, is the one trip where I have a single

168
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,360
pair of jeans as well.

169
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,800
So here we go.

170
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,800
We've got the robots out into the wild red yonder.

171
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,880
Now we've got them to their place of exploration.

172
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,480
Let's give them the cluster to one location.

173
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,800
One of the joys of being the project manager is I get to

174
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,320
pick all the music.

175
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,280
So they're clustering.

176
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,680
The way the robots are communicating is they're

177
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,720
using infrared light.

178
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,200
They're talking to their nearby robots.

179
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,840
The range is about one meter.

180
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,720
So the robots who are far away actually have to talk to

181
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,400
their neighbors, to their neighbors, to their neighbors

182
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,280
neighbors, to figure out which way to go.

183
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,360
So having all of your robots in one place in Mars is a waste

184
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,240
of a lot of taxpayers' money.

185
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,560
So let's get them to spread out.

186
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,840
There we go.

187
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,280
All right, we're all nice and spread out.

188
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,800
If you don't like where we are in Mars, we can switch to a

189
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,040
flocking behavior.

190
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,680
We can all move off together.

191
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,000
Very simple swarming.

192
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,240
Let's rotate a little more.

193
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,480
Off we go, flocking and swarming.

194
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,480
Turns out gaining and staying cohesive.

195
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,400
We see that they're kind of spreading out a little bit.

196
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,560
Gaining and remaining cohesive was really hard, turns out.

197
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,920
I thought I'd get that figured out in a few weeks.

198
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,240
Nine months later, I had a nice paper on computing the

199
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,600
boundaries of the network, which turned out to be step one

200
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,440
of what I thought was four steps.

201
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,520
One of my grad students now has figured out that it's at

202
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,680
least five steps.

203
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,440
And we're still working on keeping them to a nice,

204
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,040
coherent blob.

205
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,840
OK, so here's flocking.

206
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,280
So let's say you find something in Mars.

207
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,520
Let's say, for example, you find, oh, I don't know, a

208
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,120
knee.

209
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,400
That would be very exciting to find in Mars.

210
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,040
So what you'd want to do is get some other robots to help

211
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,360
you analyze this specimen of patellar tendinitis.

212
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,480
So I'm going to ask this robot to navigate through the

213
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,600
network to that one over there.

214
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,400
Now, when I say navigate through the network, this is the

215
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,880
same way your email routes to the internet, but these

216
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,320
robots to physically route.

217
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,120
So this begins our theme about physical data structures,

218
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,000
where the computation that's happening is in the physical

219
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,040
world, but the algorithms are computational algorithms.

220
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,360
And then a mean engineer comes and moves the robot, but

221
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:16,800
that's OK.

222
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
The network is dynamic.

223
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,400
It has to be.

224
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,280
The robots are moving all the time.

225
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,680
If the network was not being rebuilt, nothing would ever

226
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,520
work.

227
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,880
OK.

228
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,760
So there's our navigation.

229
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,360
Clustering.

230
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,000
So now we want to have three groups of robots, red, blue,

231
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,360
and green.

232
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,160
I don't care who's in what group.

233
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,880
And apparently, we don't only have one red.

234
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,640
How sad.

235
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,480
Oh, no, there's no one.

236
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
So they're trying to move to members of their own group and

237
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,960
get away from other groups.

238
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,280
So very much like junior high lunchrooms, you end up with

239
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,720
three clumps of robots doing different tasks.

240
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,280
If you wanted to, you could have them dispersed and have

241
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,360
their tasks written distitially, but that doesn't

242
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,760
make for a good demo.

243
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,760
OK.

244
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,040
This is orbiting.

245
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,840
I'm going to cheat and move the center.

246
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,720
So let's say you have found something on Mars, and you want

247
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,800
to keep it safe from Martians or anything else that may be

248
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,720
threatening your fight you find.

249
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,400
So the even-numbered robots are flashing their red lights,

250
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,240
and they're clustering around the source.

251
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,680
The odd-numbered robots are flashing their blue lights,

252
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,440
and they're orbiting the perimeter.

253
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,200
So as long as whatever is on Mars is scared of a five-inch

254
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,360
smaller robot, you're in good shape now.

255
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,440
And our last demo is my favorite.

256
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,840
So for the computer scientists in the room, this is a

257
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,160
physical bubble sort.

258
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,560
What they're going to do is they're going to arrange

259
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,960
themselves in a sorted order based on lowest ID, which is

260
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,520
this one right here.

261
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,680
That's, by the way, how the leader is selected.

262
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,040
The leader is selected not based on anything I do.

263
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,720
It's based on whoever one is the lowest ID, which means,

264
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,800
whoops, which means which everyone has never received

265
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,200
a message from a robot that's less than it.

266
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,720
OK, so now I'm going to tell them to form a straight line.

267
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,160
So all the robots with IDs, so every robot is going to

268
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
figure out, am I the lowest?

269
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,560
No, because I've got a message from robot three.

270
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,080
Likewise, one of them is going to figure out, am I the

271
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,720
highest?

272
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,640
And that one's going to be the lowest to highest.

273
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,640
All the other ones are neither the

274
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,400
lowest nor the highest, so they're going to look for the

275
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,760
highest ID less than them, and the lowest ID greater than

276
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,120
them.

277
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,000
That's their successor and their predecessor in a

278
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,840
sorted order.

279
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,760
They're going to physically move between that, that creates a

280
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,160
straight line segment, and then if they're all doing that

281
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,320
by induction, you get a globally straight line.

282
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,320
So off we go.

283
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,280
There's the highest ID.

284
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,360
It's 113, I think, indeed.

285
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,440
And all the other ones are doing their best to get

286
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:48,440
themselves arranged, and they've done a pretty good job.

287
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,680
It never works that well.

288
00:11:52,080 --> 00:12:04,760
Well, since that worked so well, I've got to do it any

289
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,440
self-respecting engineer would do, which

290
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,200
is a mess with it.

291
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,520
And the worst possible thing I can do is what I just did.

292
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,160
And now they have to then resort themselves.

293
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,240
So the little sounds are hearing.

294
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,640
Those are robots who are in bad neighborhoods.

295
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,520
They can't find a successor or they can't find a successor.

296
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,360
And they've got to kind of work it out.

297
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,080
One of the things you have to embrace with multi-year-old

298
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,560
systems is that you have to kind of have a zen with this

299
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,520
whole thing.

300
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,720
It may not happen exactly the way you want.

301
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,200
That robot may get tied into a knot.

302
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,320
It may look like a fool up here on stage.

303
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,760
But as long as you wait long enough, as long as the system

304
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,400
does not have any systematic errors, they get caught behind

305
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,080
a wall they can't get out of, they fall into a rut, then

306
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,480
well, eventually, we'll have victory.

307
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,080
Excellent.

308
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,360
Well, there's our demo.

309
00:12:48,360 --> 00:13:01,360
I'm going to leave them up here because I can't turn them off.

310
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,040
All right, let's go back to the boring PowerPoint.

311
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,280
So how do you program 20,000 robots?

312
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,200
Where does this come from?

313
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,680
So here's what the lab looked like back at our robot

314
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,720
before our room had to go over my feature space.

315
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,000
And this is 68 robots.

316
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,160
So let's do something useful with them.

317
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,560
So I've got this demo on stage.

318
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,600
Let's do something slightly more useful.

319
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,040
And what we're going to do in this video, whoops, is that

320
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,280
we're going to look for treasure in this room.

321
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,880
The treasure is hidden on the left-hand side of the screen.

322
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,200
In this case, it's an orange ball.

323
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,080
You can tell robots anything is treasure.

324
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,920
They're not very smart.

325
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,440
And you're going to see four types of robots.

326
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,840
Blue robots are on the boundaries between explore

327
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,360
space and unexplore space.

328
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,160
And they're going to ask the red robots to push them

329
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,200
forward out into the environment.

330
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,480
White robots are guides.

331
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,040
They're going to lead the humans to the treasure.

332
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,040
And green robots want to go back and go charge.

333
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,080
The video is sped up about, I think, about 10 times.

334
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,120
So off we go.

335
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,680
You can see the blue robots on the boundary.

336
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,240
And the red robots are pushing them forward.

337
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,360
Now, the robots have already found the treasure.

338
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,480
There's one over there blinking very excitedly in those

339
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,320
tables.

340
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,880
The treasure really wasn't very well hidden.

341
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,440
But like I said, robots aren't very smart.

342
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,760
So when the lights go back off, you'll see some white robots.

343
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,600
And those are guides.

344
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,680
And they're going to lead us to the treasure.

345
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,800
They're going to navigation algorithm you just saw.

346
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,640
And green robots have low batteries.

347
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,480
They're going to go back and go charge.

348
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,960
When we're all done exploring, we had to get them all back

349
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,200
home.

350
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,560
So we had to run recovery.

351
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,320
And here they are recovering.

352
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,720
They're forming actually a maximally span tree.

353
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,720
I've got a slide on this.

354
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,280
And they're all trying to get back home.

355
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,720
But the important thing about this video is that, for the

356
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,680
keen of eye, you will notice, one little robot didn't quite

357
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,320
make it home.

358
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,280
We had 104 robots that day.

359
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,080
We had enough robots, these robots, to make the floor shake

360
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,840
in this wood-framed school house, which is really very cool.

361
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,960
104 robots, one didn't get home.

362
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,640
That's less than 1%.

363
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,560
That's just fine.

364
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,240
We did have some other more serious problems, though.

365
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,880
When you're five inches tall, the world is a very big place.

366
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,920
So we tried a whole bunch of clever techniques to get them

367
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,560
to not be quite so stupid.

368
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,640
Eventually we gave up and ran around a duct tape, which

369
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,800
further through duct tape is a solution to all problems.

370
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,440
All right.

371
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,720
So where do these ideas come from?

372
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,600
And nature provides a fantastic repository of distributed

373
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,960
algorithms for which engineers can not usually seek direct

374
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,680
guidance, but almost always seek inspiration.

375
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,400
So we have leaf cutter ants, weaver ants, and a

376
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,120
carpenter ants.

377
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,800
These are my personal ants in their ant condo.

378
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,080
So here's a slide from Professor Thomas Celia Cornel.

379
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,520
And he has been studying honey bees forever, essentially.

380
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,840
And this is his idea of how they figure out where to forge

381
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,400
at a particular nectar site.

382
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,960
So the box to say things like fraudability of continuing

383
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,320
forage from site A, forward to great from site A, total

384
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,920
strength of recruitment signals from nectar source A. So they

385
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,200
can now choose between nectar source A, nectar source B,

386
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,400
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

387
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,720
So what's important about this isn't so much what it's doing

388
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,680
as is what it is.

389
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,560
So the computer scientists in the room, this is a flowchart.

390
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,040
I can take this and slap some semicolons on this and expect

391
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,760
that I can compile this and run it on my robots.

392
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,440
So the biologists get external validation of their model.

393
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,560
They can't change the software on their bees to really see

394
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,600
what is affecting what.

395
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,840
So it's good for them.

396
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,000
The engineers get software that's been debugged for 160

397
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,560
million years.

398
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,320
Get it debugged?

399
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,880
All right.

400
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,120
Here's another thing I want to look at.

401
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,920
This is multi-route manipulation.

402
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,000
And these animals do not know the geometry of their

403
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,480
environment.

404
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,800
They don't know the geometry of the potato chip.

405
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
But they're able to get it moving pretty well.

406
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,840
I want to understand how they do this.

407
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,160
OK.

408
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,600
So what does nature teach us?

409
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,480
We have an existential proof that these things work.

410
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,840
And they work well.

411
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:10,960
Ants can get to 20 million strong for army ants and

412
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,720
driver ants.

413
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,000
That's 200 pounds of ants.

414
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,840
I weigh about 200 pounds.

415
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,760
That's a lot of ants.

416
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,880
And they also tell us that population sizes can be

417
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,160
transformative to how you solve these problems.

418
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,240
You can do things with 10,000 robots that you can't do

419
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,000
with 100.

420
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,720
And you can do things with 10 million robots that you

421
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,440
can't do with 10,000.

422
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,560
Here's an example.

423
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,200
This is a boundary detection on my robots.

424
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,000
So they're trying to figure out who's on the outside and

425
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,880
who's on the inside.

426
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,600
And they've done a nice job here.

427
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,560
I can't do this with 20 robots.

428
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,800
I've got 108 here on this slide.

429
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,480
And that's brilliant enough to do this right.

430
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,280
I'd prefer to have a thousand on this slide.

431
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,080
Here I am doing it with real robots.

432
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,480
And this is on the lower right over there.

433
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,960
I tried to make it look random.

434
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,080
But that's about the smallest number of robots I could do

435
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,880
to get that geometry to run my algorithm.

436
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,800
I needed more robots.

437
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,680
So the other thing that we can take from this, now taking

438
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,480
off our biology hat, putting on our computer science hat, is

439
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,960
that this computation is unique.

440
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,920
The algorithms that we do have to go through the physical

441
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,200
world.

442
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,680
So it's not enough to just have a little piece of software

443
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,600
and think about how it's going to run.

444
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
You have to understand how the world comes into this whole

445
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,120
picture, how communication and mobility changes what the data

446
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,920
your algorithm is dealing with, and then how you can then take

447
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,640
that data and then put it back into the real world.

448
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,080
So I'm calling that physical data structures.

449
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,080
I'm here as a physical data structure.

450
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,640
This is a maximally spanning tree.

451
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,360
The blue robots are forming a communication backbone for all

452
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,080
the other robots.

453
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,520
So every robot has a connection to a blue robot

454
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,200
somewhere.

455
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,480
They can all get information to the communication highway to

456
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,160
get back home.

457
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,720
You can use this data structure not to just route

458
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,480
information around, as you can guess where I'm going.

459
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,280
You can use it to route robots around.

460
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,440
So here's a video.

461
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,400
These are the new robots.

462
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,480
These robots do not have the physical data structure.

463
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,400
And as you can see, they are unhappy.

464
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,680
They can't get home.

465
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,960
We come over here.

466
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,800
We come over here.

467
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,960
These robots do have the physical data structure.

468
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,240
And some of them are staying put so that their neighbors can

469
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,760
work their way back home.

470
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,880
One little robot got the wrong way.

471
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,200
And then his batteries died.

472
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,760
So I had to go take it out.

473
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,840
But I'm not going to let this finish.

474
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,600
But you get the idea.

475
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,840
They're all going to get home except for the one that died.

476
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,200
So life is good with data.

477
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,600
I talked about the bubble sort algorithm.

478
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,560
Here it is on PowerPoint.

479
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,520
So robot two and nine are special.

480
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,320
They know they're special.

481
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,680
Robot five wants to figure out where to go.

482
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,560
Well, that's easy.

483
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,840
It goes right there.

484
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,880
When you get more robots, well, if they each iterately move

485
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,160
to their best guess, turns out it all works out.

486
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,200
And the math behind this, I've got a student who's

487
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,120
working on the math behind this.

488
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,120
He's got actually very beautiful mathematical proof

489
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,600
that says that actually does work.

490
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,640
You've seen the video, so I can skip this.

491
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,480
Finally, we want to explore building.

492
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,000
So here we want to get the robots to spread out

493
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,160
as far as possible to search everything in the building.

494
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,520
But if the building is too big to search simultaneously,

495
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,640
what can you do?

496
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,280
You have to have somebody to keep track of where you've been.

497
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,840
So we'll get them to go through the hallway.

498
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,200
They'll find a junction.

499
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,360
They'll do a push onto their physical stack

500
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,720
where they're now going this way.

501
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,040
Everyone go this way.

502
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,920
They go that way.

503
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,520
Then they see everyone go this way.

504
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,000
The green robot and the red robot

505
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,160
are storing information about which way they're exploring.

506
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,000
They get to a junction.

507
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,160
They get to an endpoint.

508
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,040
They tell the green robot to switch.

509
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,040
Now the information has been updated.

510
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,240
So now you know the new way to explore.

511
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,040
So if you can source information where you need it,

512
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,400
aka at the junction, and you can update it without ever having

513
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,200
to have the robots build a global map.

514
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,280
They don't know where they are.

515
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,800
They just know I'm at a junction.

516
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,720
I'm facing this way.

517
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,080
And you can do that in real life.

518
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,640
Very nice.

519
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,920
Thank you.

520
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,360
So here the robots are coming down.

521
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,440
The junction robot is the one with the dunce cap.

522
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,200
I'm using that just to mark where the junction is.

523
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,720
This one here is going to find the junction

524
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,960
and then point that way.

525
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,160
Everyone go that way.

526
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,880
The robots now head out.

527
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,320
We'll speed up again.

528
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,680
When it gets to the end of the corridor,

529
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,760
there's another dunce cap marking the end.

530
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,040
That robot over there says, I'm at the end.

531
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,520
Everyone go the other way.

532
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,640
And then they all go the other way.

533
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,120
And that's where my students' camera ran out of memory.

534
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,440
But you can store the state physically, which

535
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,640
is you can get some real efficiencies there.

536
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,320
OK, summary.

537
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,320
Multiracisms are going to become the norm, not the exception.

538
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,480
I'll put my stake in the ground on that.

539
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,000
We need algorithms, theory, and horror

540
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,480
to support this revolution.

541
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,000
So the research in my group tries

542
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,160
to cover all these things.

543
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,800
We're heavy on algorithms.

544
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,080
And then 50% algorithms, 25% theory and hardware.

545
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,720
The real breakthrough that I'm trying to make

546
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,920
is how to understand how to do the sensing, computation,

547
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,440
actuation through the physical world

548
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,680
and how to reason about it in a nice, clear way.

549
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,640
Computer science, essentially as a branch of mathematics,

550
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,600
has made a lot of advances because they

551
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,400
have a nice, clean model of how to deal with computation.

552
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,440
So I want that for the robots.

553
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,360
And I think physical data structures are a way to do that.

554
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,800
OK, so Act 3, real watch in the classroom.

555
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,720
So taking off my research hat, putting it on my professor hat,

556
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,840
my scholarly teaching hat, is that I

557
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,080
want to have impact on education.

558
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,240
So we are in an education crisis right now.

559
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,600
We have policy and politics that are largely

560
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,240
anti-education or funding.

561
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,680
I live in Texas now, which is, well, is Texas.

562
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,400
So if people say, we spent all this money on education,

563
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,480
it's really bad, we should cut the funding

564
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,640
because it's not doing any good.

565
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,280
That doesn't make any sense.

566
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,720
We should double the salary of all the teachers, just

567
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,160
right there.

568
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,160
So that way, my students, when they come out,

569
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,880
they have an offer from, again, this is Texas.

570
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,360
So they have an offer from, what was that,

571
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:20,440
Exxon for $89k, and offer from a local school for maybe $60k.

572
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,720
So you're asking her to take a $29,000 pay cut.

573
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,920
Right now, you're asking her to take a $59,000 pay cut.

574
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,800
And that doesn't make any sense.

575
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,400
All right.

576
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,000
So these ones here are above my pay grade.

577
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,920
Let's deal with these bottom three.

578
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,400
Count to protect your social pressure on students,

579
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,480
a.k.a. you're a dork, you're a geek,

580
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,760
you should not be doing technology,

581
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,520
particularly if your skin is brown.

582
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,760
Uninspired curriculum and amazing access

583
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,680
of fun and technical curriculum.

584
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,120
So I think robots at the rescue can solve this problem.

585
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,480
I think we can fix this.

586
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,200
I want to increase engineering literacy

587
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,440
with a fun hands-on curriculum.

588
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,000
I want to work in the real world with real robots.

589
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,560
This is what I give the freshman in my class,

590
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,560
first semester freshman at Rice University.

591
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,200
Everyone gets a Tupperware container.

592
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,400
Inside the Tupperware container, they find,

593
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,840
they don't find this.

594
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,080
They find a USB connector.

595
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,960
They find a piece of an anti-static phone.

596
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,280
And they find their very own mobile robot.

597
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,480
This is what they use in my engineering systems class.

598
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,280
We cover mechanical engineering, computer science,

599
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,280
and electrical engineering.

600
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,400
They take control theory, communications,

601
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,760
basic robot behaviors, simple artificial intelligence,

602
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,840
all in the course of the fall semester.

603
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,880
So we'll set that up here.

604
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,560
So blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

605
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,440
The world didn't need a robot, but of course,

606
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,360
we did need a robot.

607
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,320
So I built one, old robots, new robots.

608
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,120
We'll skip all this stuff.

609
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,080
The robot that we have now, the new one that we're working on,

610
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,120
is an advanced, low-cost, multi-robot.

611
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,200
It does almost everything these 2003 versions do,

612
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,720
except it does it at about one-tenth the cost.

613
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,120
So it's advanced enough for real-life research.

614
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,680
It's robust enough for classroom users,

615
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,040
and it's cheap enough for a K-12 outreach.

616
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,840
The dial will be open sometime next year.

617
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,320
We're going to release this stuff so that everyone

618
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,200
can use this thing.

619
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,360
So the sensors that we have are a bunch.

620
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,240
They're light sensors.

621
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,040
And you know what?

622
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,520
I'm going to skip this.

623
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,720
You can find us on the website.

624
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,840
Lots of sensors.

625
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,080
Really simple mechanical design.

626
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,000
And lots of sensors, by the way, not only

627
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,720
makes your robot a better robot, but it opens up

628
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,680
huge curriculum possibilities, even fun possibilities.

629
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,480
You can use this robot as remote control

630
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,520
to control another one.

631
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,840
That's a great homework activity to give your students.

632
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,640
At any rate, amazingly simple, elegant design.

633
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,600
I can take a little bit of the credit for this.

634
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,240
My students are fantastic.

635
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,640
For 14 screws, whole robot, 14 screws.

636
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,080
I love it.

637
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,400
You can do real science with them.

638
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,000
So I gave these to my graduate class

639
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,520
and said, you know what?

640
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,720
Go find existing algorithms in the literature

641
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,600
and run them on these robots.

642
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,320
The video here is doing a PARCO filter.

643
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,720
The yellow circle is an estimate of the position

644
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,960
of the red circle.

645
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,880
These robots, they're cheap.

646
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,400
They don't have fantastic sensing.

647
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,200
But with the right processing, you

648
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,760
can have a pretty good estimate of where your red neighbor is.

649
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,440
But the real thing that I'm proudest of

650
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,760
is my freshman class.

651
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,080
It's NG128, first semester freshman.

652
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,600
And we want to attract talented but dissuaded students.

653
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,920
Students who have been told, you

654
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,400
are far too feminine to be an engineer.

655
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,360
You're far too brown to be an engineer.

656
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,840
Or why would you want to be a geek,

657
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,320
even though you can make three times the money I'm going to make?

658
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,240
So we want to get those students and have them come back

659
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,520
to engineering, people who weren't interested but have

660
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,000
been turned off by social pressure.

661
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
So we have six design challenges.

662
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,280
These change year to year.

663
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,800
But here's what we've got this year.

664
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,160
Cookie cream, where you lift up a bag of melanos and eat them.

665
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,280
Bug wars, we're doing croquet on Tuesday.

666
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,840
Flocking, tic-tac-toe, and finally robot quiddish.

667
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,800
We're going to focus on these last two.

668
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,280
So here is croquet.

669
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,360
We give them the robots.

670
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,240
We use all these crazy courses on the ground.

671
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,320
They have to go to get the robot to drive through this course

672
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,440
and get through the wicket.

673
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,000
And some of these wickets are 35 feet long.

674
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,800
It's a long way for a little robot to go.

675
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,920
And here is Michael starting.

676
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,800
There is Mika.

677
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,560
I don't know what she's doing.

678
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,680
But she's typing something on the robot

679
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,120
and she looks very serious about it.

680
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,960
But she didn't know software when she got here.

681
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,280
And she's hacking this code.

682
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,480
It's fantastic.

683
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,920
For our final project, we did quiddish.

684
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,160
And it's very simple.

685
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,120
You have bludgers, seekers, quaffos, and snitches.

686
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,080
And there's one snitch right down there.

687
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,360
That's my own custom design.

688
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,520
It was faster, meaner, and more powerful than the robots,

689
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,720
but they still caught it.

690
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,240
And it was one of those situations

691
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,600
in which everything worked out from an engineering point

692
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:39,800
of view.

693
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,920
And that never happened.

694
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,640
So the software works.

695
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,920
One of my colleagues has a beautiful Python interpreter

696
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,080
that runs these robots so the students can write in Python,

697
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,440
not in C. The hardware works very well.

698
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,880
I did a last minute change to the communication system

699
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,000
that didn't break everything.

700
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,440
That was great.

701
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,200
And we had some good competition.

702
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,720
So it was beautiful.

703
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,960
This means it'll never happen again.

704
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,360
But it was wonderful.

705
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,600
So that's my point.

706
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,440
I'm going to stop there.

707
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,000
There's a video to play.

708
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,640
Let's go.

709
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,640
Let's play the Q&A video.

710
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,960
So here's our old robot platform.

711
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,920
These robots are designed for research.

712
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,920
They're fantastic.

713
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,520
But they're frighteningly expensive.

714
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,560
So I want to get robots to everyone.

715
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,240
And the way to do that is to build this new platform.

716
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,560
This is the Vice R1 Mobile Robot.

717
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,320
And it is advanced enough for multi-robot research.

718
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,080
It is robust enough for undergraduate and graduate

719
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,080
education.

720
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,800
And it is cheap enough for K12 outreach.

721
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,240
So these are robots that we want to get to everyone.

722
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,840
And we want them to be as popular

723
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,720
as scientific calculators.

724
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,080
So this is the wall of parts that we've slowly built up

725
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,280
over time.

726
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,240
So we have almost every single part that

727
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,800
goes on one of these robots.

728
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,000
We want to see all the lights flashing in the system

729
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,200
to make sure every single light is working.

730
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,480
The antennas are just like the way your phone works.

731
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,320
We send information over the antenna.

732
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,880
And everybody receives the same information.

733
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,640
But their second form of communication is infrared.

734
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,680
It's directional.

735
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,560
So the two robots are going to send IR information similar

736
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,520
to the way a TV remote works.

737
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,920
The total parts count for this robot

738
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,320
is right around nine assembled parts.

739
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,560
Once you have all the parts counted.

740
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,680
It's actually 14, I miscounted.

741
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,200
This robot is simply enough that we're

742
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,200
going to offer it first as a kit form in the upcoming year

743
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,680
so that anyone can go and order these things

744
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,360
and build them at home or build them in your lab

745
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,760
or build them in your school.

746
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,960
We put them through a class last semester of freshman.

747
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,080
And I was kind of in the head TA.

748
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,360
So I was responsible when all the robots had a problem.

749
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,760
And I saw ones that I was almost certain

750
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,520
were dropped in a pool of water at one point.

751
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,920
And they still were able to work.

752
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,120
My work is on multi-robot systems.

753
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,080
You can call them swarm robots.

754
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,760
So I'm not interested in building one robot or two robots.

755
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,320
I start to get interested when we talk about 100 or 100,000

756
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,280
robots.

757
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,960
So in order for me to do that in my lab,

758
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,280
I need to have a robot platform that

759
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,840
is small enough and cheap enough for me

760
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,760
to build at least hundreds of them.

761
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,160
They're following this blue robot right now.

762
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,520
Everyone that is following the blue

763
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,200
is lower than the blue right now.

764
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,880
With following, it's a good way to have the robots navigate

765
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,720
more complicated obstacles in a follow.

766
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,720
There are many applications from multi-robot systems.

767
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,400
Recently, we just had an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

768
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,640
So it'd be fantastic to have 1,000 little robots swimming

769
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,200
around the Gulf identifying where the oil actually went.

770
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,160
Earthquakes.

771
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:48,960
We've had earthquakes.

772
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,800
We've had tornadoes.

773
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,200
We've had tsunamis.

774
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,760
Having robots that can penetrate the robot

775
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,080
pile of the building, look for survivors.

776
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,440
Identify is the power on, is the power off.

777
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,800
These are things that robots can do far better than people can.

778
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,360
This is a flocking behavior.

779
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,280
So their goal here is to actually just match

780
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,280
each other's orientation.

781
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,720
So there's no leader this time.

782
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,760
So it's pretty much like just a cluster of robots

783
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,840
that are all trying to make some sort of smart decision

784
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,640
on what they want to do.

785
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,640
And the goal of clustering is the even-numbered robots

786
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,520
will go, will turn red.

787
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,720
And the odd number of robots will turn blue.

788
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,240
And we'll see if we can get them to cluster.

789
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,200
But they'll stay together in a cluster.

790
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,680
I can try to separate one and say, stop clustering together.

791
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,440
And eventually, they'll all move towards that robot.

792
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,760
And they'll form a new cluster.

793
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,720
Here is our 2003 design.

794
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,520
It's a full, sophisticated research platform.

795
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,240
Here is our 2012 design.

796
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,400
It does almost the same stuff, except it's one-tenth the price.

797
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,600
Rice University, the R1 mobile robot.

798
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,040
Robots for everyone.

799
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:05,520
Thank you.

800
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:12,640
So I'm actually a minute and seven seconds over time.

801
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,480
I've been told I can take a single question.

802
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,440
So let's have it be a really kick-ass question.

803
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:18,880
Where's the mic?

804
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,280
There we go.

805
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,320
Are you working with Dean Cayman in first at all?

806
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,160
Do you know First Robotics?

807
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,800
Are you in contact and working with them?

808
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,840
Am I working with Dean Cayman in first at Vox?

809
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,080
No, I'm not.

810
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,600
But I'm a huge fan of what he's done in particular.

811
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,960
He looked at the problem and said,

812
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,640
this is not a technical problem.

813
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,000
We have a social problem.

814
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,200
We need to rock starify science, technology, engineering,

815
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,760
mathematics, so that is cool to be a geek.

816
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,480
And yeah, no, we can clap for that.

817
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:55,120
So and the robots are just a tool to make that happen.

818
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,640
And they sold off the Georgia Dome three years ago.

819
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,240
I mean, it's fantastically.

820
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,320
So I'm a huge fan.

821
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:02,880
Well, that's it.

822
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,000
Thank you.

823
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,200
Thank you so much, Professor James McLarkin.

824
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:07,700
Great job.

825
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,560
I'm really glad we got to give you the demo.
