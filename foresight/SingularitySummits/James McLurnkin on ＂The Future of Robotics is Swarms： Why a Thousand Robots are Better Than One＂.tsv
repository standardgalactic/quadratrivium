0	2080	about that shortly.
2080	5280	So we have one more speaker before lunch,
5280	7200	and it is Professor James McClurkin.
7200	9600	He is the Professor of Computer Science at Rice University
9600	12360	and a leading expert in swarm robotics.
12360	15880	From 1999 to 2003, he was the lead research scientist
15880	20360	at iRobot, where he managed the DARPA-funded swarm project.
20360	23440	In 2003, as a PhD candidate at MIT,
23440	27120	he won the Lemelson-MIT Prize for Student Invention.
27120	28800	Professor McClurkin's research is inspired
28800	33440	by the behavior of ants, bees, wasps, and termites.
33440	35200	He develops distributed algorithms
35200	37360	that allow cheap robots to exhibit
37360	39680	similarly advanced group behaviors,
39680	43600	including exploration and even dynamic task assignment.
43600	46120	He is here to explain how multi-robot systems offer
46120	48840	faster and cheaper solutions for many problems,
48840	51560	and he has brought some robots along for a live demo.
51560	53160	Please welcome Professor James McClurkin.
53920	54920	Thank you.
59920	60920	Good morning, everyone.
60920	63800	I have the honor of standing between you and lunch,
63800	66520	so I'll do my best to keep my remarks efficient
66520	69760	and as interesting as possible.
69760	72440	So we talked about swarm robots,
72440	74560	and I've got this talk divided into three acts.
74560	77520	For Act 1, let's get into the robot revolution.
77520	79440	As the slide already says, it has already begun,
79440	81200	and it is televised.
81200	81920	Here's the Roomba.
81920	83080	They sold 3 million of these.
83080	85320	It's a fantastic little robot.
85320	86880	It runs around to clean your floors.
86880	88280	It does it all the way you're not home.
88280	90400	Does it do as well as you do with a vacuum?
90400	94440	No, but you don't have to push it.
94440	97400	Honda's Asimov, arguably the most advanced human robot
97400	98760	on the planet, just in case you're
98760	101800	wondering if it's Asimov right there in the middle.
101800	104280	And the job of Asimov is to help people.
104280	106720	So we've spent the last 10,000 years
106720	108800	building a human-sized and human-shaped world,
108800	110640	so we need a robot that can go out there
110640	113400	and work with us in our own place.
113400	114240	The Packbot.
114240	116600	This is by iRobot.
116600	118120	And if you're these two warfighters,
118120	120680	do you want to go into this cave or send the robot in?
120680	123200	Well, that's easy.
123200	125320	iRobot builds them, sends them out like that.
125320	126960	Sometimes they come back like that.
126960	129680	And regardless of your views of our current foreign policy,
129680	131800	what we're doing overseas, or any of this stuff
131800	133800	that's going on with our military,
133800	135800	this is far better than the alternative.
135800	138480	And the postcard says, iRobot, thank you for all of your support.
138480	140560	You have saved lives today.
141560	143640	So these are the three Ds of robotics.
143640	146720	These are tasks that are dangerous, dirty, and dull.
146720	148280	And you can figure out which ones are which
148280	150400	based on the images if you want.
150400	152000	But I argue that there's a fourth D.
152000	155000	There's a fourth D of robotics that is distributed.
155000	157000	And I think the next generation of robotics,
157000	159040	the future of a futuristic field,
159040	162000	is distributed systems, robots that can go and work together
162000	164360	and do so in very large populations.
164360	166280	Here's my favorite current example.
166280	167800	And this is Kiva Systems.
167920	171600	This is one of their warehouse setups.
171600	175520	And they have huge populations of robots that work together.
175520	176960	They're not quite fully distributed,
176960	178440	but they do have some local autonomy.
178440	180440	There's a big giant centralized controller
180440	181840	that tells them what to do.
181840	184560	And the number of robots have let them fundamentally
184560	187360	transform the warehouse to distribute some problem.
187360	189000	You don't need to have pickers and placers
189000	190520	to pick stuff off of the shelves.
190520	192000	The shelves come to you.
192000	194480	You have humans on the periphery of the warehouse.
194480	196280	Big 18-wheelers come in on one side
196280	199280	loaded with one set of goods, a big truck of staples,
199280	202520	a big truck of pencils, a big truck of pens to show up.
202520	203600	Robots wheel up.
203600	204280	They line up.
204280	206080	People put the things onto the carts.
206080	207880	The robots go somewhere.
207880	209160	No one cares.
209160	210720	On the other side of the warehouse,
210720	213040	small trucks show up for individual stores.
213040	215520	The robots again line up from somewhere.
215520	217280	No one cares.
217280	221000	And the humans can put the stuff onto the small trucks.
221000	223680	All the while, the inventory is actually moving and marching
223680	224680	around the warehouse.
224680	226000	If you need to move to a bigger warehouse,
226000	227160	you just build a ramp between them.
227160	228640	I think Staples did this.
228640	230360	And the robots march up to your new place.
230360	231720	Fantastic stuff.
231720	235400	So transforming the problem through large populations
235400	238200	is what I'm really thinking about.
238200	240000	So imagine if a forest fire.
240000	241280	We just had a bunch in Texas.
241280	243640	What if you had 20 robots to look for hotspots
243640	244960	in this forest fire?
244960	247280	This could prevent flare-ups from happening behind your
247280	247840	fire fires.
247840	249920	This would be fantastic.
249920	250640	Earthquakes.
250640	253840	Here's a job that humans are uniquely ill-suited to do.
253840	255560	We're either too big to get into either the rubble
255600	257200	or we're too weak to lift the rubble off
257200	258560	if we find a survivor.
258560	260720	So I imagine for this, I have 200 here.
260720	261840	I should change the slide.
261840	263560	I imagine a whole ecosystem of robots.
263560	266360	I imagine maybe 20,000 cockroach-sized robots who
266360	267960	can look for signs of life.
267960	270400	They then relay their findings through their cockroach
270400	272880	radio network to a bunch of rat-sized robots who
272880	274480	are structural engineers.
274480	277600	This is New York City, so we got serious rats here.
277600	281480	And these robots then can solve the reverse Junker problem,
281480	283640	figuring out how to excrete this person stately.
283640	284440	They've got blueprints.
284440	286280	They know where the signs could have occurred.
286280	287480	They can solve this problem.
287480	289160	They then relay their instructions to a bunch of
289160	293040	brontosaurus-sized heavy-litters who can then go in and do
293040	295520	the reverse Junker problem of getting the person out.
295520	298200	So this would be a fantastic thing for robots to do.
298200	300720	One of my favorite applications, though, is sending
300720	302240	robots to other planets.
302240	303760	So right now, we have two robots in Mars.
303760	305560	Or we had two robots in Mars.
305560	308360	Next slide, please.
308360	310560	What if we had 2,000?
310560	312080	And it might look something like this.
312080	313600	So here's my demo.
313600	316680	And I have to start the demo in the way that you need to
316680	320360	never start a demo by begging forgiveness, because the
320360	324320	house Wi-Fi is really powerful.
324320	325680	My robots are less so.
336840	339000	OK, so here is my robots.
339000	340240	They have just landed on Mars.
343240	345360	For this demo, there's going to be a human in charge of the
345360	349240	swarm, me, namely.
349240	352080	And the first thing you need to do is get the robots away
352080	353760	from the landing site.
353760	358720	So I'm going to ask this one to lead its colleagues out into
358720	360120	the wild red yonder.
360120	368480	I think they're saying down in front.
372040	376160	So the problem is that I need to carry this guy around,
376160	379360	because I've only got about two feet of range because of
379360	382160	the Wi-Fi system.
382160	385760	But let's all imagine that we have a nice, smooth follow
385760	387240	the leader going on.
387240	388600	I've never done this for my knees before.
388600	390280	This is really kind of fun.
390280	393640	The robots themselves talk to each other using infrared
393640	394320	light.
394320	398000	So if I can get them into a happy configuration, they can
398000	399480	take care of themselves.
399480	400760	And that's what I'm going to try to do.
413160	415080	This, of course, is the one trip where I have a single
415080	417360	pair of jeans as well.
418160	418800	So here we go.
418800	422800	We've got the robots out into the wild red yonder.
422800	424880	Now we've got them to their place of exploration.
424880	426480	Let's give them the cluster to one location.
430760	432800	One of the joys of being the project manager is I get to
432800	434320	pick all the music.
434320	435280	So they're clustering.
435280	436680	The way the robots are communicating is they're
436680	437720	using infrared light.
437720	439200	They're talking to their nearby robots.
439200	440840	The range is about one meter.
440840	442720	So the robots who are far away actually have to talk to
442720	444400	their neighbors, to their neighbors, to their neighbors
444400	447280	neighbors, to figure out which way to go.
447280	450360	So having all of your robots in one place in Mars is a waste
450360	452240	of a lot of taxpayers' money.
452240	453560	So let's get them to spread out.
457080	457840	There we go.
460600	463280	All right, we're all nice and spread out.
463280	465800	If you don't like where we are in Mars, we can switch to a
465800	467040	flocking behavior.
473240	474680	We can all move off together.
474680	477000	Very simple swarming.
477040	478240	Let's rotate a little more.
482480	485480	Off we go, flocking and swarming.
485480	487480	Turns out gaining and staying cohesive.
487480	489400	We see that they're kind of spreading out a little bit.
489400	492560	Gaining and remaining cohesive was really hard, turns out.
492560	494920	I thought I'd get that figured out in a few weeks.
494920	499240	Nine months later, I had a nice paper on computing the
499240	502600	boundaries of the network, which turned out to be step one
502600	504440	of what I thought was four steps.
504440	506520	One of my grad students now has figured out that it's at
506520	507680	least five steps.
507680	510440	And we're still working on keeping them to a nice,
510440	512040	coherent blob.
512040	514840	OK, so here's flocking.
514840	517280	So let's say you find something in Mars.
517280	521520	Let's say, for example, you find, oh, I don't know, a
521520	522120	knee.
522120	524400	That would be very exciting to find in Mars.
524400	527040	So what you'd want to do is get some other robots to help
527040	531360	you analyze this specimen of patellar tendinitis.
531360	534480	So I'm going to ask this robot to navigate through the
534480	535600	network to that one over there.
535600	537400	Now, when I say navigate through the network, this is the
537400	539880	same way your email routes to the internet, but these
539880	541320	robots to physically route.
541320	545120	So this begins our theme about physical data structures,
545120	548000	where the computation that's happening is in the physical
548000	553040	world, but the algorithms are computational algorithms.
553040	556360	And then a mean engineer comes and moves the robot, but
556360	556800	that's OK.
556800	557800	The network is dynamic.
557800	558400	It has to be.
558400	560280	The robots are moving all the time.
560280	562680	If the network was not being rebuilt, nothing would ever
562680	564520	work.
564520	565880	OK.
565880	568760	So there's our navigation.
568760	569360	Clustering.
569360	572000	So now we want to have three groups of robots, red, blue,
572000	572360	and green.
572360	574160	I don't care who's in what group.
574160	575880	And apparently, we don't only have one red.
575880	576640	How sad.
576640	578480	Oh, no, there's no one.
578480	580480	So they're trying to move to members of their own group and
580480	581960	get away from other groups.
581960	585280	So very much like junior high lunchrooms, you end up with
585280	587720	three clumps of robots doing different tasks.
587720	591280	If you wanted to, you could have them dispersed and have
591280	593360	their tasks written distitially, but that doesn't
593360	594760	make for a good demo.
594760	595760	OK.
598440	600040	This is orbiting.
600040	602840	I'm going to cheat and move the center.
602840	604720	So let's say you have found something on Mars, and you want
604720	608800	to keep it safe from Martians or anything else that may be
608800	610720	threatening your fight you find.
610720	613400	So the even-numbered robots are flashing their red lights,
613400	616240	and they're clustering around the source.
616240	618680	The odd-numbered robots are flashing their blue lights,
618680	620440	and they're orbiting the perimeter.
620440	623200	So as long as whatever is on Mars is scared of a five-inch
623200	625360	smaller robot, you're in good shape now.
628920	632440	And our last demo is my favorite.
632440	634840	So for the computer scientists in the room, this is a
634840	636160	physical bubble sort.
636160	637560	What they're going to do is they're going to arrange
637560	641960	themselves in a sorted order based on lowest ID, which is
641960	643520	this one right here.
643520	645680	That's, by the way, how the leader is selected.
645680	648040	The leader is selected not based on anything I do.
648040	651720	It's based on whoever one is the lowest ID, which means,
651720	656800	whoops, which means which everyone has never received
656800	659200	a message from a robot that's less than it.
659200	661720	OK, so now I'm going to tell them to form a straight line.
661720	665160	So all the robots with IDs, so every robot is going to
665160	666160	figure out, am I the lowest?
666160	668560	No, because I've got a message from robot three.
668560	671080	Likewise, one of them is going to figure out, am I the
671080	671720	highest?
671720	674640	And that one's going to be the lowest to highest.
674640	675640	All the other ones are neither the
675640	677400	lowest nor the highest, so they're going to look for the
677400	680760	highest ID less than them, and the lowest ID greater than
680760	681120	them.
681120	683000	That's their successor and their predecessor in a
683000	683840	sorted order.
683840	685760	They're going to physically move between that, that creates a
685760	688160	straight line segment, and then if they're all doing that
688160	690320	by induction, you get a globally straight line.
690320	691320	So off we go.
695160	696280	There's the highest ID.
696280	699360	It's 113, I think, indeed.
699360	701440	And all the other ones are doing their best to get
701440	708440	themselves arranged, and they've done a pretty good job.
708440	709680	It never works that well.
712080	724760	Well, since that worked so well, I've got to do it any
724760	726440	self-respecting engineer would do, which
726440	728200	is a mess with it.
728200	731520	And the worst possible thing I can do is what I just did.
731520	735160	And now they have to then resort themselves.
735160	736240	So the little sounds are hearing.
736240	737640	Those are robots who are in bad neighborhoods.
737640	740520	They can't find a successor or they can't find a successor.
740520	742360	And they've got to kind of work it out.
742360	744080	One of the things you have to embrace with multi-year-old
744080	746560	systems is that you have to kind of have a zen with this
746560	747520	whole thing.
747520	749720	It may not happen exactly the way you want.
749720	751200	That robot may get tied into a knot.
751200	753320	It may look like a fool up here on stage.
753320	755760	But as long as you wait long enough, as long as the system
755760	760400	does not have any systematic errors, they get caught behind
760400	764080	a wall they can't get out of, they fall into a rut, then
764080	766480	well, eventually, we'll have victory.
766480	767080	Excellent.
767080	768360	Well, there's our demo.
768360	781360	I'm going to leave them up here because I can't turn them off.
781360	785040	All right, let's go back to the boring PowerPoint.
785040	789280	So how do you program 20,000 robots?
789280	790200	Where does this come from?
793200	796680	So here's what the lab looked like back at our robot
796720	799720	before our room had to go over my feature space.
799720	801000	And this is 68 robots.
801000	803160	So let's do something useful with them.
803160	804560	So I've got this demo on stage.
804560	806600	Let's do something slightly more useful.
806600	810040	And what we're going to do in this video, whoops, is that
810040	812280	we're going to look for treasure in this room.
812280	814880	The treasure is hidden on the left-hand side of the screen.
814880	816200	In this case, it's an orange ball.
816200	818080	You can tell robots anything is treasure.
818080	819920	They're not very smart.
819920	821440	And you're going to see four types of robots.
821440	823840	Blue robots are on the boundaries between explore
823840	825360	space and unexplore space.
825360	827160	And they're going to ask the red robots to push them
827160	829200	forward out into the environment.
829200	830480	White robots are guides.
830480	832040	They're going to lead the humans to the treasure.
832040	835040	And green robots want to go back and go charge.
835040	838080	The video is sped up about, I think, about 10 times.
838080	839120	So off we go.
839120	841680	You can see the blue robots on the boundary.
841680	845240	And the red robots are pushing them forward.
845240	847360	Now, the robots have already found the treasure.
847360	849480	There's one over there blinking very excitedly in those
849480	851320	tables.
851320	852880	The treasure really wasn't very well hidden.
852880	855440	But like I said, robots aren't very smart.
855440	858760	So when the lights go back off, you'll see some white robots.
858760	859600	And those are guides.
859600	861680	And they're going to lead us to the treasure.
861680	863800	They're going to navigation algorithm you just saw.
863800	865640	And green robots have low batteries.
865640	868480	They're going to go back and go charge.
868480	870960	When we're all done exploring, we had to get them all back
870960	871200	home.
871200	872560	So we had to run recovery.
872560	874320	And here they are recovering.
874320	876720	They're forming actually a maximally span tree.
876720	877720	I've got a slide on this.
877720	879280	And they're all trying to get back home.
879280	882720	But the important thing about this video is that, for the
882720	887680	keen of eye, you will notice, one little robot didn't quite
887680	888320	make it home.
888320	890280	We had 104 robots that day.
890280	893080	We had enough robots, these robots, to make the floor shake
893080	895840	in this wood-framed school house, which is really very cool.
895840	897960	104 robots, one didn't get home.
897960	899640	That's less than 1%.
899640	901560	That's just fine.
901560	905240	We did have some other more serious problems, though.
905240	907880	When you're five inches tall, the world is a very big place.
907880	909920	So we tried a whole bunch of clever techniques to get them
909920	912560	to not be quite so stupid.
912600	915640	Eventually we gave up and ran around a duct tape, which
915640	919800	further through duct tape is a solution to all problems.
919800	920440	All right.
920440	922720	So where do these ideas come from?
922720	927600	And nature provides a fantastic repository of distributed
927600	932960	algorithms for which engineers can not usually seek direct
932960	936680	guidance, but almost always seek inspiration.
936680	940400	So we have leaf cutter ants, weaver ants, and a
940440	941120	carpenter ants.
941120	944800	These are my personal ants in their ant condo.
944800	948080	So here's a slide from Professor Thomas Celia Cornel.
948080	951520	And he has been studying honey bees forever, essentially.
951520	955840	And this is his idea of how they figure out where to forge
955840	958400	at a particular nectar site.
958400	960960	So the box to say things like fraudability of continuing
960960	964320	forage from site A, forward to great from site A, total
964320	966920	strength of recruitment signals from nectar source A. So they
966920	969200	can now choose between nectar source A, nectar source B,
969200	970400	blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
970400	973720	So what's important about this isn't so much what it's doing
973720	975680	as is what it is.
975680	978560	So the computer scientists in the room, this is a flowchart.
978560	982040	I can take this and slap some semicolons on this and expect
982040	984760	that I can compile this and run it on my robots.
984760	989440	So the biologists get external validation of their model.
989440	992560	They can't change the software on their bees to really see
992560	994600	what is affecting what.
994600	995840	So it's good for them.
995840	999000	The engineers get software that's been debugged for 160
999000	1000560	million years.
1000560	1003320	Get it debugged?
1003320	1004880	All right.
1004880	1006120	Here's another thing I want to look at.
1006120	1007920	This is multi-route manipulation.
1007920	1011000	And these animals do not know the geometry of their
1011000	1011480	environment.
1011480	1012800	They don't know the geometry of the potato chip.
1012800	1014800	But they're able to get it moving pretty well.
1014800	1016840	I want to understand how they do this.
1016840	1018160	OK.
1018160	1020600	So what does nature teach us?
1020600	1023480	We have an existential proof that these things work.
1023480	1024840	And they work well.
1024840	1030960	Ants can get to 20 million strong for army ants and
1030960	1031720	driver ants.
1031720	1033000	That's 200 pounds of ants.
1033000	1034840	I weigh about 200 pounds.
1034840	1036760	That's a lot of ants.
1036760	1039880	And they also tell us that population sizes can be
1039880	1042160	transformative to how you solve these problems.
1042160	1046240	You can do things with 10,000 robots that you can't do
1046240	1047000	with 100.
1047000	1048720	And you can do things with 10 million robots that you
1048720	1050440	can't do with 10,000.
1050440	1051560	Here's an example.
1051560	1054200	This is a boundary detection on my robots.
1054200	1056000	So they're trying to figure out who's on the outside and
1056000	1056880	who's on the inside.
1056880	1058600	And they've done a nice job here.
1058600	1060560	I can't do this with 20 robots.
1060560	1064800	I've got 108 here on this slide.
1064800	1066480	And that's brilliant enough to do this right.
1066480	1069280	I'd prefer to have a thousand on this slide.
1069280	1071080	Here I am doing it with real robots.
1071080	1074480	And this is on the lower right over there.
1074480	1075960	I tried to make it look random.
1075960	1078080	But that's about the smallest number of robots I could do
1078080	1080880	to get that geometry to run my algorithm.
1080880	1083800	I needed more robots.
1083800	1087680	So the other thing that we can take from this, now taking
1087680	1090480	off our biology hat, putting on our computer science hat, is
1090480	1092960	that this computation is unique.
1092960	1095920	The algorithms that we do have to go through the physical
1095920	1097200	world.
1097200	1100680	So it's not enough to just have a little piece of software
1100680	1102600	and think about how it's going to run.
1102600	1104600	You have to understand how the world comes into this whole
1104600	1108120	picture, how communication and mobility changes what the data
1108120	1109920	your algorithm is dealing with, and then how you can then take
1109920	1113640	that data and then put it back into the real world.
1113680	1116080	So I'm calling that physical data structures.
1116080	1118080	I'm here as a physical data structure.
1118080	1120640	This is a maximally spanning tree.
1120640	1125360	The blue robots are forming a communication backbone for all
1125360	1126080	the other robots.
1126080	1128520	So every robot has a connection to a blue robot
1128520	1129200	somewhere.
1129200	1132480	They can all get information to the communication highway to
1132480	1134160	get back home.
1134160	1136720	You can use this data structure not to just route
1136720	1140480	information around, as you can guess where I'm going.
1140480	1142280	You can use it to route robots around.
1142280	1143440	So here's a video.
1143440	1144400	These are the new robots.
1144400	1147480	These robots do not have the physical data structure.
1147480	1149400	And as you can see, they are unhappy.
1149400	1150680	They can't get home.
1150680	1151960	We come over here.
1159360	1160800	We come over here.
1160800	1162960	These robots do have the physical data structure.
1162960	1165240	And some of them are staying put so that their neighbors can
1165240	1166760	work their way back home.
1166760	1168880	One little robot got the wrong way.
1168880	1170200	And then his batteries died.
1170200	1171760	So I had to go take it out.
1174000	1177840	But I'm not going to let this finish.
1177840	1178600	But you get the idea.
1178600	1180840	They're all going to get home except for the one that died.
1180840	1184200	So life is good with data.
1184200	1185600	I talked about the bubble sort algorithm.
1185600	1187560	Here it is on PowerPoint.
1187560	1189520	So robot two and nine are special.
1189520	1190320	They know they're special.
1190320	1192680	Robot five wants to figure out where to go.
1192680	1193560	Well, that's easy.
1193560	1194840	It goes right there.
1194840	1197880	When you get more robots, well, if they each iterately move
1197880	1201160	to their best guess, turns out it all works out.
1201160	1203200	And the math behind this, I've got a student who's
1203240	1204120	working on the math behind this.
1204120	1206120	He's got actually very beautiful mathematical proof
1206120	1207600	that says that actually does work.
1207600	1210640	You've seen the video, so I can skip this.
1210640	1212480	Finally, we want to explore building.
1212480	1215000	So here we want to get the robots to spread out
1215000	1218160	as far as possible to search everything in the building.
1218160	1220520	But if the building is too big to search simultaneously,
1220520	1221640	what can you do?
1221640	1224280	You have to have somebody to keep track of where you've been.
1224280	1225840	So we'll get them to go through the hallway.
1225840	1227200	They'll find a junction.
1227200	1229360	They'll do a push onto their physical stack
1229360	1230720	where they're now going this way.
1230720	1232040	Everyone go this way.
1232040	1232920	They go that way.
1232920	1234520	Then they see everyone go this way.
1234520	1236000	The green robot and the red robot
1236000	1240160	are storing information about which way they're exploring.
1240160	1241000	They get to a junction.
1241000	1242160	They get to an endpoint.
1242160	1244040	They tell the green robot to switch.
1244040	1246040	Now the information has been updated.
1246040	1248240	So now you know the new way to explore.
1248240	1251040	So if you can source information where you need it,
1251040	1254400	aka at the junction, and you can update it without ever having
1254400	1256200	to have the robots build a global map.
1256200	1257280	They don't know where they are.
1257280	1258800	They just know I'm at a junction.
1258800	1260720	I'm facing this way.
1260720	1262080	And you can do that in real life.
1265160	1265640	Very nice.
1265640	1266920	Thank you.
1266920	1268360	So here the robots are coming down.
1268360	1270440	The junction robot is the one with the dunce cap.
1270440	1273200	I'm using that just to mark where the junction is.
1273200	1275720	This one here is going to find the junction
1275720	1277960	and then point that way.
1277960	1280160	Everyone go that way.
1280160	1282880	The robots now head out.
1282880	1285320	We'll speed up again.
1285320	1287680	When it gets to the end of the corridor,
1287680	1289760	there's another dunce cap marking the end.
1289760	1292040	That robot over there says, I'm at the end.
1292040	1293520	Everyone go the other way.
1293520	1295640	And then they all go the other way.
1295640	1298120	And that's where my students' camera ran out of memory.
1300840	1302440	But you can store the state physically, which
1302440	1304640	is you can get some real efficiencies there.
1304640	1306320	OK, summary.
1306320	1310320	Multiracisms are going to become the norm, not the exception.
1310320	1313480	I'll put my stake in the ground on that.
1313480	1315000	We need algorithms, theory, and horror
1315000	1316480	to support this revolution.
1316480	1318000	So the research in my group tries
1318000	1319160	to cover all these things.
1319160	1320800	We're heavy on algorithms.
1320800	1325080	And then 50% algorithms, 25% theory and hardware.
1325080	1327720	The real breakthrough that I'm trying to make
1327720	1330920	is how to understand how to do the sensing, computation,
1330920	1333440	actuation through the physical world
1333440	1335680	and how to reason about it in a nice, clear way.
1335680	1338640	Computer science, essentially as a branch of mathematics,
1338640	1342600	has made a lot of advances because they
1342600	1345400	have a nice, clean model of how to deal with computation.
1345400	1347440	So I want that for the robots.
1347440	1350360	And I think physical data structures are a way to do that.
1350360	1354800	OK, so Act 3, real watch in the classroom.
1354800	1357720	So taking off my research hat, putting it on my professor hat,
1357720	1359840	my scholarly teaching hat, is that I
1359840	1363080	want to have impact on education.
1363080	1367240	So we are in an education crisis right now.
1367240	1369600	We have policy and politics that are largely
1369600	1372240	anti-education or funding.
1372240	1375680	I live in Texas now, which is, well, is Texas.
1375680	1378400	So if people say, we spent all this money on education,
1378400	1380480	it's really bad, we should cut the funding
1380480	1381640	because it's not doing any good.
1381640	1384280	That doesn't make any sense.
1384280	1386720	We should double the salary of all the teachers, just
1386720	1387160	right there.
1387160	1389160	So that way, my students, when they come out,
1389160	1391880	they have an offer from, again, this is Texas.
1391880	1394360	So they have an offer from, what was that,
1394360	1400440	Exxon for $89k, and offer from a local school for maybe $60k.
1400440	1403720	So you're asking her to take a $29,000 pay cut.
1403760	1407920	Right now, you're asking her to take a $59,000 pay cut.
1407920	1409800	And that doesn't make any sense.
1409800	1410400	All right.
1410400	1414000	So these ones here are above my pay grade.
1414000	1415920	Let's deal with these bottom three.
1415920	1418400	Count to protect your social pressure on students,
1418400	1420480	a.k.a. you're a dork, you're a geek,
1420480	1421760	you should not be doing technology,
1421760	1423520	particularly if your skin is brown.
1423520	1425760	Uninspired curriculum and amazing access
1425760	1428680	of fun and technical curriculum.
1428680	1432120	So I think robots at the rescue can solve this problem.
1432120	1433480	I think we can fix this.
1433480	1435200	I want to increase engineering literacy
1435200	1437440	with a fun hands-on curriculum.
1437440	1441000	I want to work in the real world with real robots.
1441000	1443560	This is what I give the freshman in my class,
1443560	1445560	first semester freshman at Rice University.
1445560	1447200	Everyone gets a Tupperware container.
1447200	1449400	Inside the Tupperware container, they find,
1449400	1450840	they don't find this.
1450840	1453080	They find a USB connector.
1453080	1454960	They find a piece of an anti-static phone.
1454960	1457280	And they find their very own mobile robot.
1457280	1459480	This is what they use in my engineering systems class.
1459480	1462280	We cover mechanical engineering, computer science,
1462280	1463280	and electrical engineering.
1463280	1466400	They take control theory, communications,
1466400	1470760	basic robot behaviors, simple artificial intelligence,
1470760	1474840	all in the course of the fall semester.
1474840	1475880	So we'll set that up here.
1479840	1481560	So blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1481560	1483440	The world didn't need a robot, but of course,
1483440	1484360	we did need a robot.
1484360	1486320	So I built one, old robots, new robots.
1486320	1488120	We'll skip all this stuff.
1488120	1491080	The robot that we have now, the new one that we're working on,
1491080	1493120	is an advanced, low-cost, multi-robot.
1493120	1497200	It does almost everything these 2003 versions do,
1497200	1499720	except it does it at about one-tenth the cost.
1499720	1502120	So it's advanced enough for real-life research.
1502120	1503680	It's robust enough for classroom users,
1503680	1506040	and it's cheap enough for a K-12 outreach.
1506040	1507840	The dial will be open sometime next year.
1507840	1510320	We're going to release this stuff so that everyone
1510320	1512200	can use this thing.
1512200	1514360	So the sensors that we have are a bunch.
1514360	1515240	They're light sensors.
1515240	1516040	And you know what?
1516040	1516520	I'm going to skip this.
1516520	1517720	You can find us on the website.
1517720	1520840	Lots of sensors.
1520840	1523080	Really simple mechanical design.
1523120	1525000	And lots of sensors, by the way, not only
1525000	1526720	makes your robot a better robot, but it opens up
1526720	1529680	huge curriculum possibilities, even fun possibilities.
1529680	1531480	You can use this robot as remote control
1531480	1532520	to control another one.
1532520	1534840	That's a great homework activity to give your students.
1534840	1537640	At any rate, amazingly simple, elegant design.
1537640	1539600	I can take a little bit of the credit for this.
1539600	1541240	My students are fantastic.
1541240	1543640	For 14 screws, whole robot, 14 screws.
1543640	1546080	I love it.
1546080	1547400	You can do real science with them.
1547400	1549000	So I gave these to my graduate class
1549000	1549520	and said, you know what?
1549520	1551720	Go find existing algorithms in the literature
1551760	1553600	and run them on these robots.
1553600	1555320	The video here is doing a PARCO filter.
1555320	1557720	The yellow circle is an estimate of the position
1557720	1558960	of the red circle.
1558960	1560880	These robots, they're cheap.
1560880	1562400	They don't have fantastic sensing.
1562400	1564200	But with the right processing, you
1564200	1566760	can have a pretty good estimate of where your red neighbor is.
1569640	1571440	But the real thing that I'm proudest of
1571440	1572760	is my freshman class.
1572760	1575080	It's NG128, first semester freshman.
1575080	1578600	And we want to attract talented but dissuaded students.
1578600	1580920	Students who have been told, you
1580920	1583400	are far too feminine to be an engineer.
1583400	1585360	You're far too brown to be an engineer.
1585360	1586840	Or why would you want to be a geek,
1586840	1590320	even though you can make three times the money I'm going to make?
1590320	1592240	So we want to get those students and have them come back
1592240	1594520	to engineering, people who weren't interested but have
1594520	1597000	been turned off by social pressure.
1597000	1599000	So we have six design challenges.
1599000	1600280	These change year to year.
1600280	1601800	But here's what we've got this year.
1601800	1605160	Cookie cream, where you lift up a bag of melanos and eat them.
1605160	1608280	Bug wars, we're doing croquet on Tuesday.
1608280	1610840	Flocking, tic-tac-toe, and finally robot quiddish.
1610840	1612800	We're going to focus on these last two.
1612800	1614280	So here is croquet.
1614280	1615360	We give them the robots.
1615360	1617240	We use all these crazy courses on the ground.
1617240	1619320	They have to go to get the robot to drive through this course
1619320	1620440	and get through the wicket.
1620440	1623000	And some of these wickets are 35 feet long.
1623000	1625800	It's a long way for a little robot to go.
1625800	1629920	And here is Michael starting.
1629920	1630800	There is Mika.
1630800	1631560	I don't know what she's doing.
1631560	1632680	But she's typing something on the robot
1632680	1634120	and she looks very serious about it.
1634120	1636960	But she didn't know software when she got here.
1636960	1638280	And she's hacking this code.
1638280	1639480	It's fantastic.
1639520	1641920	For our final project, we did quiddish.
1641920	1643160	And it's very simple.
1643160	1646120	You have bludgers, seekers, quaffos, and snitches.
1646120	1648080	And there's one snitch right down there.
1648080	1649360	That's my own custom design.
1649360	1651520	It was faster, meaner, and more powerful than the robots,
1651520	1653720	but they still caught it.
1653720	1656240	And it was one of those situations
1656240	1659600	in which everything worked out from an engineering point
1659600	1659800	of view.
1659800	1660920	And that never happened.
1660920	1662640	So the software works.
1662640	1664920	One of my colleagues has a beautiful Python interpreter
1664920	1667080	that runs these robots so the students can write in Python,
1667080	1669440	not in C. The hardware works very well.
1670000	1671880	I did a last minute change to the communication system
1671880	1673000	that didn't break everything.
1673000	1674440	That was great.
1674440	1676200	And we had some good competition.
1676200	1677720	So it was beautiful.
1677720	1678960	This means it'll never happen again.
1678960	1681360	But it was wonderful.
1681360	1683600	So that's my point.
1683600	1684440	I'm going to stop there.
1684440	1686000	There's a video to play.
1686000	1686640	Let's go.
1686640	1690640	Let's play the Q&A video.
1690640	1692960	So here's our old robot platform.
1692960	1694920	These robots are designed for research.
1694920	1695920	They're fantastic.
1695920	1698520	But they're frighteningly expensive.
1698600	1701560	So I want to get robots to everyone.
1701560	1705240	And the way to do that is to build this new platform.
1705240	1707560	This is the Vice R1 Mobile Robot.
1707560	1711320	And it is advanced enough for multi-robot research.
1711320	1715080	It is robust enough for undergraduate and graduate
1715080	1716080	education.
1716080	1719800	And it is cheap enough for K12 outreach.
1719800	1722240	So these are robots that we want to get to everyone.
1722240	1723840	And we want them to be as popular
1723840	1725720	as scientific calculators.
1725760	1729080	So this is the wall of parts that we've slowly built up
1729080	1730280	over time.
1730280	1732240	So we have almost every single part that
1732240	1733800	goes on one of these robots.
1733800	1736000	We want to see all the lights flashing in the system
1736000	1738200	to make sure every single light is working.
1738200	1741480	The antennas are just like the way your phone works.
1741480	1744320	We send information over the antenna.
1744320	1746880	And everybody receives the same information.
1746880	1749640	But their second form of communication is infrared.
1749640	1750680	It's directional.
1750680	1754560	So the two robots are going to send IR information similar
1754560	1757520	to the way a TV remote works.
1757520	1759920	The total parts count for this robot
1759920	1763320	is right around nine assembled parts.
1763320	1764560	Once you have all the parts counted.
1764560	1765680	It's actually 14, I miscounted.
1765680	1768200	This robot is simply enough that we're
1768200	1771200	going to offer it first as a kit form in the upcoming year
1771200	1773680	so that anyone can go and order these things
1773680	1776360	and build them at home or build them in your lab
1776360	1777760	or build them in your school.
1777760	1781960	We put them through a class last semester of freshman.
1781960	1784080	And I was kind of in the head TA.
1784080	1788360	So I was responsible when all the robots had a problem.
1788360	1790760	And I saw ones that I was almost certain
1790760	1793520	were dropped in a pool of water at one point.
1793520	1795920	And they still were able to work.
1795920	1798120	My work is on multi-robot systems.
1798120	1800080	You can call them swarm robots.
1800080	1803760	So I'm not interested in building one robot or two robots.
1803760	1807320	I start to get interested when we talk about 100 or 100,000
1807320	1808280	robots.
1808280	1810960	So in order for me to do that in my lab,
1810960	1813280	I need to have a robot platform that
1813280	1816840	is small enough and cheap enough for me
1816840	1819760	to build at least hundreds of them.
1819760	1822160	They're following this blue robot right now.
1822160	1824520	Everyone that is following the blue
1824520	1826200	is lower than the blue right now.
1826200	1830880	With following, it's a good way to have the robots navigate
1830880	1833720	more complicated obstacles in a follow.
1833720	1836720	There are many applications from multi-robot systems.
1836720	1839400	Recently, we just had an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
1839400	1843640	So it'd be fantastic to have 1,000 little robots swimming
1843640	1847200	around the Gulf identifying where the oil actually went.
1847200	1848160	Earthquakes.
1848160	1848960	We've had earthquakes.
1848960	1849800	We've had tornadoes.
1849800	1851200	We've had tsunamis.
1851200	1853760	Having robots that can penetrate the robot
1853760	1856080	pile of the building, look for survivors.
1856080	1859440	Identify is the power on, is the power off.
1859440	1862800	These are things that robots can do far better than people can.
1862800	1864360	This is a flocking behavior.
1864360	1867280	So their goal here is to actually just match
1867280	1868280	each other's orientation.
1868280	1869720	So there's no leader this time.
1869720	1873760	So it's pretty much like just a cluster of robots
1873760	1875840	that are all trying to make some sort of smart decision
1875840	1877640	on what they want to do.
1877640	1880640	And the goal of clustering is the even-numbered robots
1880640	1883520	will go, will turn red.
1883520	1885720	And the odd number of robots will turn blue.
1885720	1888240	And we'll see if we can get them to cluster.
1888240	1890200	But they'll stay together in a cluster.
1890200	1894680	I can try to separate one and say, stop clustering together.
1894680	1897440	And eventually, they'll all move towards that robot.
1897440	1899760	And they'll form a new cluster.
1899760	1901720	Here is our 2003 design.
1901720	1904520	It's a full, sophisticated research platform.
1904520	1906240	Here is our 2012 design.
1906240	1910400	It does almost the same stuff, except it's one-tenth the price.
1910400	1913600	Rice University, the R1 mobile robot.
1913600	1915040	Robots for everyone.
1915040	1925520	Thank you.
1925520	1932640	So I'm actually a minute and seven seconds over time.
1932640	1934480	I've been told I can take a single question.
1934480	1938440	So let's have it be a really kick-ass question.
1938440	1938880	Where's the mic?
1938880	1940280	There we go.
1940280	1943320	Are you working with Dean Cayman in first at all?
1943360	1945160	Do you know First Robotics?
1945160	1947800	Are you in contact and working with them?
1947800	1949840	Am I working with Dean Cayman in first at Vox?
1949840	1951080	No, I'm not.
1951080	1954600	But I'm a huge fan of what he's done in particular.
1954600	1955960	He looked at the problem and said,
1955960	1957640	this is not a technical problem.
1957640	1959000	We have a social problem.
1959000	1962200	We need to rock starify science, technology, engineering,
1962200	1965760	mathematics, so that is cool to be a geek.
1965760	1967480	And yeah, no, we can clap for that.
1968480	1975120	So and the robots are just a tool to make that happen.
1975120	1978640	And they sold off the Georgia Dome three years ago.
1978640	1980240	I mean, it's fantastically.
1980240	1982320	So I'm a huge fan.
1982320	1982880	Well, that's it.
1982880	1984000	Thank you.
1984000	1987200	Thank you so much, Professor James McLarkin.
1987200	1987700	Great job.
1987700	1990560	I'm really glad we got to give you the demo.
