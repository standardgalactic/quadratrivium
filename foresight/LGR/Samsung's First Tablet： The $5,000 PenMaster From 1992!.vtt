00:00.000 --> 00:11.200
Greetings and welcome to an LGR thing, and this lovely device is the Samsung PenMaster

00:11.200 --> 00:17.520
386SL20, a touchscreen tablet computer from 1992.

00:17.520 --> 00:25.160
Back then, this started at a price of $3,995, with costs heading upwards of $5,000 for a

00:25.160 --> 00:28.400
fully-specced example with additional storage.

00:28.400 --> 00:32.480
While being that this was Samsung's first tablet computer on the market, and one that

00:32.480 --> 00:37.760
packed an impressive 386 MS-DOS PC inside, it's little wonder that it cost half as much

00:37.760 --> 00:41.120
as a 1992 GeoStorm back then.

00:41.120 --> 00:47.160
Shout out to Lorne, by the way, an LGR viewer who sent this example for me to review.

00:47.160 --> 00:52.120
These are not common machines whatsoever, especially this particular model from Samsung.

00:52.120 --> 00:55.120
Ooh, and he also included some Chicago popcorn.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.360
What's this?

00:56.360 --> 00:57.360
Caramel and cheese?

00:57.360 --> 01:00.080
Mmm, that's some tasty stuff.

01:00.080 --> 01:02.040
But yeah, anyway, the PenMaster.

01:02.040 --> 01:09.080
It's pretty large, by today's tablet standards, measuring 11.5 x 9.5 x 1.8 inches, and weighing

01:09.080 --> 01:14.040
in at 5.5 pounds, or 2.5 kilograms, with the battery installed.

01:14.040 --> 01:18.160
But back when it was one of the brand new, pen-based computer systems debuting at the

01:18.160 --> 01:22.240
1991 Fall Comdex show, this was darned impressive.

01:22.240 --> 01:27.320
So much so that portable computing pioneer grid systems licensed the design from Samsung

01:27.600 --> 01:32.920
and sold their own slightly better-known variant called the GridPad SL.

01:32.920 --> 01:36.360
Believe it or not, Grid and Samsung weren't the only companies releasing cutting-edge

01:36.360 --> 01:38.400
tablets in the early 90s either.

01:38.400 --> 01:43.960
The PenMaster was introduced right alongside offerings from Momenta, TelePad, and Dolphin

01:43.960 --> 01:45.320
Technology.

01:45.320 --> 01:49.120
If that last one sounds familiar, perhaps you've seen my previous video about the Dolphin

01:49.120 --> 01:50.120
DTR-1.

01:50.120 --> 01:54.920
That was a pretty similar tablet PC in many respects, even running the same base operating

01:54.920 --> 02:00.640
environment as the PenMaster, yet it didn't hit the market until a year later, in 1993.

02:00.640 --> 02:05.000
On the timescale of early 90s computing, that may as well be an eternity, so let's take

02:05.000 --> 02:10.680
a look at what Samsung was doing in these earlier days of touchscreen tablet PCs.

02:10.680 --> 02:15.720
As its name implies, the PenMaster comes with a pen suitable for all manner of mastering

02:15.720 --> 02:20.280
outfitted in a blue plastic body matching the word pen in the logo.

02:20.280 --> 02:24.880
It has a single button on the side for right-clicking, and the pen position can even be detected

02:25.080 --> 02:28.520
a centimeter away from the surface of the tablet screen.

02:28.520 --> 02:32.600
So yeah, the pen is battery-powered and was pretty advanced for the time, with replacements

02:32.600 --> 02:35.520
from Samsung costing 80 bucks each.

02:35.520 --> 02:40.600
Naturally, this is intended to work with the resistive touchscreen display here, a backlit

02:40.600 --> 02:46.480
10-inch monochrome LCD panel that displays VGA in up to 32 shades of gray, coincidentally

02:46.480 --> 02:48.760
the title of my upcoming romance novel.

02:48.760 --> 02:52.680
And along the top of the device, there's an assortment of stubby sliding switches,

02:52.680 --> 02:58.600
including the power, brightness, and contrast controls, a tiny reset button, and LED indicators

02:58.600 --> 03:00.600
for power and hard disk activity.

03:00.600 --> 03:05.400
A majority of the I.O. functionality is found on the right-hand side, with a spot for the

03:05.400 --> 03:12.680
17.5 volt DC power brick, a PS2 keyboard port, 9-pin serial port, Samsung floppy drive interface,

03:12.680 --> 03:18.280
parallel port, VGA video output, and a 2400 BPS datafax modem.

03:18.280 --> 03:23.240
On the left-hand side of the unit is where you get the single PCMCIA slot for expansion

03:23.240 --> 03:24.240
cards.

03:24.240 --> 03:28.920
On top is where the rechargeable 1.7 amp hour battery is installed, which originally boasted

03:28.920 --> 03:33.680
a 2-hour battery life, and along the bottom edge is absolutely nothing.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.560
Just a nice rounded butt.

03:35.560 --> 03:41.640
And underneath is all the expected model number and FCC text, as well as 4 rubber feet, signaling

03:41.640 --> 03:44.280
how it's built for plopping down on a flat surface.

03:44.280 --> 03:48.680
Yeah, at 5.5 pounds and a couple inches thick, it's just not the type of tablet you want

03:48.680 --> 03:50.800
to hold in your hands for very long.

03:50.800 --> 03:54.360
However you choose to set it up, though, the main thing to do is make sure it's charged

03:54.360 --> 03:57.080
up or plugged in so you can get it turned on.

04:03.240 --> 04:08.120
At this point, the PenMaster boots up like any PC of the time period, performs the standard

04:08.120 --> 04:11.840
hardware checks, and begins loading the operating system.

04:11.840 --> 04:17.880
Go corporations PenPoint and CIC PenDOS were both available as options from Samsung, but

04:17.880 --> 04:22.360
this one came with Microsoft Windows for pen computing version 1.0.

04:22.360 --> 04:27.400
Based on Windows 3.1 for desktops, it'll feel darn familiar to anyone used to that,

04:27.400 --> 04:31.680
with the main additions being the Microsoft PenTools applications.

04:31.680 --> 04:36.240
Things like the pen palette for handwriting recognition, the training program for helping

04:36.240 --> 04:40.100
you to understand your sloppy handwriting, and the on-screen keyboard for when all other

04:40.100 --> 04:42.740
inputs inevitably fall flat on their face.

04:42.740 --> 04:47.820
There's also the handy notebook application, much more involved than good ol' notepad.

04:47.820 --> 04:51.660
This is meant to take the place of a personal organizer and rid your life of pesky paper

04:51.660 --> 04:53.740
calendars once and for all.

04:53.740 --> 04:54.740
In theory.

04:54.740 --> 04:59.220
Yeah, all this handwriting recognition stuff with Windows for pen computing never really

04:59.220 --> 05:02.860
struck me as something I'd want to use for anything more than a few minutes.

05:02.860 --> 05:06.940
Once the novelty of it actually recognizing a few simple words wears off, you're left

05:06.940 --> 05:10.160
struggling with the awkwardness of everything else.

05:10.160 --> 05:14.700
Even after training the software, errors are commonplace, and the fact that the remainder

05:14.700 --> 05:19.220
of the Windows interface is basically unchanged from the desktop PC version doesn't do it

05:19.220 --> 05:21.740
any favors in terms of usability.

05:21.740 --> 05:27.540
At the same time, though, this was 1992, and the pen master was like a glimpse into the

05:27.540 --> 05:28.620
future.

05:28.620 --> 05:33.940
It was a portable touchscreen computer with an integrated 20 MHz 3 to 6 SLCPU and up

05:33.940 --> 05:38.540
to 20 megs of RAM, more than enough to take on most anything you'd care to throw at an

05:38.540 --> 05:40.300
early 90s tablet.

05:40.300 --> 05:43.820
Which nowadays, I mean, is mostly gonna be solitaire in paintbrush, amirite?

05:43.820 --> 05:48.540
Sure, it cost between four and five grand when it was new, but come on, screwing around

05:48.540 --> 05:53.660
with classic Windows 3 applications using a touchscreen and a stylus is just a giggle-worthy

05:53.660 --> 05:54.660
spectacle.

05:54.660 --> 05:59.060
Especially since it's on hardware that was absolutely at the forefront for the time period,

05:59.060 --> 06:02.220
rarely used by the average home computer user.

06:02.220 --> 06:06.260
It's no surprise that a good number of the pen master machines from both Samsung and

06:06.260 --> 06:11.380
Grid ended up being sold directly to professionals instead of through general retail.

06:11.380 --> 06:15.220
After all, its price and functionality fit more in line with the needs of government,

06:15.220 --> 06:19.780
medical, business, and education sectors, not the rando at Radio Shack who just wants

06:19.780 --> 06:21.780
to play Wolfenstein 3D.

06:21.780 --> 06:25.980
Not to say you couldn't play Wolfenstein 3D on here, it's certainly capable of doing

06:25.980 --> 06:31.020
so, but there were a thousand cheaper and more suitable options for that in 1992.

06:31.020 --> 06:35.260
Even as much as I love to show something like Wolfenstein 3D running on here, unfortunately

06:35.260 --> 06:37.820
I ran into some roadblocks preventing that.

06:37.820 --> 06:42.380
For one thing, the three and a half inch floppy drive it came with no longer reads disquets

06:42.380 --> 06:52.180
at all, making this rather concerning noise anytime you try.

06:52.180 --> 06:56.380
And to make matters worse, the hard drive barely works either at this point, crapping

06:56.380 --> 07:01.180
out seemingly at random.

07:01.180 --> 07:06.260
This not only froze the system constantly, but the entire drive eventually refused to

07:06.260 --> 07:08.260
show up in the BIOS at all.

07:08.260 --> 07:12.620
And yes, I've taken everything apart, reseeded all the things and put the machine back together

07:12.620 --> 07:17.460
half a dozen times, but that cranky old 63 megabyte quantum go drive just wants me to

07:17.460 --> 07:19.900
get off its lawn and let it rest in peace.

07:19.900 --> 07:24.540
I ended up getting a blank refurbished one that works perfectly, but even after days

07:24.540 --> 07:28.340
of trying I haven't been able to get the old drive working again to make a backup,

07:28.340 --> 07:31.460
and I don't have copies of the original software either.

07:31.460 --> 07:36.500
Ah well, at least this gives us an excuse to gaze upon its delightful internals, which

07:36.500 --> 07:41.500
really looks a lot like a laptop smashed together without the keyboard and with some extra circuitry

07:41.500 --> 07:42.740
for the touchscreen.

07:42.740 --> 07:47.660
Speaking of which, the Pen Master relies on a chipset by none other than Wacom Company

07:47.660 --> 07:52.660
Limited, who made several pioneering pen controlled computing products and still sells digital

07:52.660 --> 07:54.100
drawing devices today.

07:54.540 --> 08:00.220
Also making a standout appearance is that lovely Intel 386SL20 CPU with an accompanying

08:00.220 --> 08:04.260
socket ready to make use of a 387 math coprocessor.

08:04.260 --> 08:08.940
And up above that, there's the small but densely populated power supply board right

08:08.940 --> 08:15.180
next to the internal PC speaker and the Tataran TL5186 coin cell for the CMOS in real-time

08:15.180 --> 08:16.180
clock.

08:16.180 --> 08:20.020
Yeah, overall I'd say Samsung did a nice job fitting so much into a relatively small

08:20.020 --> 08:23.780
package considering the early 90s tech they were working with.

08:23.780 --> 08:29.220
The chunky battery, 2.5-inch hard drive and full-sized IOPorts bulk this thing up quite

08:29.220 --> 08:30.220
a bit.

08:30.220 --> 08:34.420
It was a long way to go in optimizing portable computing tech, that's for sure.

08:34.420 --> 08:39.460
And that's about it for the Samsung Pen Master, a fascinating early entry into the tablet

08:39.460 --> 08:40.820
PC marketplace.

08:40.820 --> 08:46.300
The one that didn't make much of a lasting impression, it seems.

08:46.300 --> 08:50.780
That was undoubtedly due in part to its limited distribution and lofty price point, but also

08:50.780 --> 08:55.340
because this was Samsung's first tablet and one that was simply early to the tablet

08:55.340 --> 08:57.180
party in general.

08:57.180 --> 09:02.540
Exciting as they were in 1992, tablets really didn't become a thing until the 2010s, and

09:02.540 --> 09:07.420
even then when Samsung released their first Android tablet, the Galaxy Tab, I recall plenty

09:07.420 --> 09:12.420
of naysayers and derisive opinions questioning who actually needed a tablet computer.

09:12.420 --> 09:16.660
Samsung strikes me as one of those companies that throws every new form factor at the wall

09:16.660 --> 09:20.500
to see what sticks, even if the timing isn't exactly optimal.

09:20.500 --> 09:26.300
And the Pen Master is an enjoyable example of that from all the way back in 1992.

09:26.300 --> 09:29.540
You know, I don't really have any profound point to make here except to say that I'm

09:29.540 --> 09:35.100
continually amused by the fast-moving trends in tech and how quickly consumers collectively

09:35.100 --> 09:39.420
forget the numerous milestones along the way to where we are now.

09:39.420 --> 09:44.260
Forgotten devices like the Pen Master paved the way for the future, at least in some small

09:44.260 --> 09:46.460
part decades in advance.

09:46.460 --> 09:58.500
And for that, I think things like this deserve a second look.

09:58.500 --> 10:03.540
If you enjoyed this look at the Pen Master, might I suggest my video on the Dauphin DTR-1,

10:03.540 --> 10:05.780
or any number of other bits of retro tech history?

10:05.780 --> 10:08.500
I cover a lot of stuff here on LGR.

10:08.500 --> 10:11.060
As always though, thank you very much for watching.
