00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,200
Greetings and welcome to an LGR thing, and this lovely device is the Samsung PenMaster

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,520
386SL20, a touchscreen tablet computer from 1992.

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:25,160
Back then, this started at a price of $3,995, with costs heading upwards of $5,000 for a

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,400
fully-specced example with additional storage.

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,480
While being that this was Samsung's first tablet computer on the market, and one that

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,760
packed an impressive 386 MS-DOS PC inside, it's little wonder that it cost half as much

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,120
as a 1992 GeoStorm back then.

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,160
Shout out to Lorne, by the way, an LGR viewer who sent this example for me to review.

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,120
These are not common machines whatsoever, especially this particular model from Samsung.

10
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,120
Ooh, and he also included some Chicago popcorn.

11
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,360
What's this?

12
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,360
Caramel and cheese?

13
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,080
Mmm, that's some tasty stuff.

14
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,040
But yeah, anyway, the PenMaster.

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:09,080
It's pretty large, by today's tablet standards, measuring 11.5 x 9.5 x 1.8 inches, and weighing

16
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,040
in at 5.5 pounds, or 2.5 kilograms, with the battery installed.

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,160
But back when it was one of the brand new, pen-based computer systems debuting at the

18
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,240
1991 Fall Comdex show, this was darned impressive.

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,320
So much so that portable computing pioneer grid systems licensed the design from Samsung

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,920
and sold their own slightly better-known variant called the GridPad SL.

21
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,360
Believe it or not, Grid and Samsung weren't the only companies releasing cutting-edge

22
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,400
tablets in the early 90s either.

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,960
The PenMaster was introduced right alongside offerings from Momenta, TelePad, and Dolphin

24
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,320
Technology.

25
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,120
If that last one sounds familiar, perhaps you've seen my previous video about the Dolphin

26
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,120
DTR-1.

27
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,920
That was a pretty similar tablet PC in many respects, even running the same base operating

28
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,640
environment as the PenMaster, yet it didn't hit the market until a year later, in 1993.

29
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,000
On the timescale of early 90s computing, that may as well be an eternity, so let's take

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,680
a look at what Samsung was doing in these earlier days of touchscreen tablet PCs.

31
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,720
As its name implies, the PenMaster comes with a pen suitable for all manner of mastering

32
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,280
outfitted in a blue plastic body matching the word pen in the logo.

33
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,880
It has a single button on the side for right-clicking, and the pen position can even be detected

34
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,520
a centimeter away from the surface of the tablet screen.

35
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,600
So yeah, the pen is battery-powered and was pretty advanced for the time, with replacements

36
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,520
from Samsung costing 80 bucks each.

37
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,600
Naturally, this is intended to work with the resistive touchscreen display here, a backlit

38
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:46,480
10-inch monochrome LCD panel that displays VGA in up to 32 shades of gray, coincidentally

39
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,760
the title of my upcoming romance novel.

40
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,680
And along the top of the device, there's an assortment of stubby sliding switches,

41
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,600
including the power, brightness, and contrast controls, a tiny reset button, and LED indicators

42
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
for power and hard disk activity.

43
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,400
A majority of the I.O. functionality is found on the right-hand side, with a spot for the

44
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:12,680
17.5 volt DC power brick, a PS2 keyboard port, 9-pin serial port, Samsung floppy drive interface,

45
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,280
parallel port, VGA video output, and a 2400 BPS datafax modem.

46
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,240
On the left-hand side of the unit is where you get the single PCMCIA slot for expansion

47
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
cards.

48
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,920
On top is where the rechargeable 1.7 amp hour battery is installed, which originally boasted

49
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,680
a 2-hour battery life, and along the bottom edge is absolutely nothing.

50
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,560
Just a nice rounded butt.

51
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,640
And underneath is all the expected model number and FCC text, as well as 4 rubber feet, signaling

52
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,280
how it's built for plopping down on a flat surface.

53
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,680
Yeah, at 5.5 pounds and a couple inches thick, it's just not the type of tablet you want

54
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,800
to hold in your hands for very long.

55
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,360
However you choose to set it up, though, the main thing to do is make sure it's charged

56
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,080
up or plugged in so you can get it turned on.

57
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,120
At this point, the PenMaster boots up like any PC of the time period, performs the standard

58
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,840
hardware checks, and begins loading the operating system.

59
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,880
Go corporations PenPoint and CIC PenDOS were both available as options from Samsung, but

60
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,360
this one came with Microsoft Windows for pen computing version 1.0.

61
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,400
Based on Windows 3.1 for desktops, it'll feel darn familiar to anyone used to that,

62
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,680
with the main additions being the Microsoft PenTools applications.

63
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,240
Things like the pen palette for handwriting recognition, the training program for helping

64
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,100
you to understand your sloppy handwriting, and the on-screen keyboard for when all other

65
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,740
inputs inevitably fall flat on their face.

66
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,820
There's also the handy notebook application, much more involved than good ol' notepad.

67
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,660
This is meant to take the place of a personal organizer and rid your life of pesky paper

68
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,740
calendars once and for all.

69
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,740
In theory.

70
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,220
Yeah, all this handwriting recognition stuff with Windows for pen computing never really

71
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,860
struck me as something I'd want to use for anything more than a few minutes.

72
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,940
Once the novelty of it actually recognizing a few simple words wears off, you're left

73
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,160
struggling with the awkwardness of everything else.

74
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,700
Even after training the software, errors are commonplace, and the fact that the remainder

75
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,220
of the Windows interface is basically unchanged from the desktop PC version doesn't do it

76
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,740
any favors in terms of usability.

77
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:27,540
At the same time, though, this was 1992, and the pen master was like a glimpse into the

78
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,620
future.

79
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,940
It was a portable touchscreen computer with an integrated 20 MHz 3 to 6 SLCPU and up

80
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,540
to 20 megs of RAM, more than enough to take on most anything you'd care to throw at an

81
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,300
early 90s tablet.

82
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,820
Which nowadays, I mean, is mostly gonna be solitaire in paintbrush, amirite?

83
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,540
Sure, it cost between four and five grand when it was new, but come on, screwing around

84
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:53,660
with classic Windows 3 applications using a touchscreen and a stylus is just a giggle-worthy

85
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,660
spectacle.

86
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,060
Especially since it's on hardware that was absolutely at the forefront for the time period,

87
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,220
rarely used by the average home computer user.

88
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,260
It's no surprise that a good number of the pen master machines from both Samsung and

89
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:11,380
Grid ended up being sold directly to professionals instead of through general retail.

90
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,220
After all, its price and functionality fit more in line with the needs of government,

91
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,780
medical, business, and education sectors, not the rando at Radio Shack who just wants

92
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,780
to play Wolfenstein 3D.

93
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,980
Not to say you couldn't play Wolfenstein 3D on here, it's certainly capable of doing

94
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:31,020
so, but there were a thousand cheaper and more suitable options for that in 1992.

95
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,260
Even as much as I love to show something like Wolfenstein 3D running on here, unfortunately

96
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,820
I ran into some roadblocks preventing that.

97
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,380
For one thing, the three and a half inch floppy drive it came with no longer reads disquets

98
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:52,180
at all, making this rather concerning noise anytime you try.

99
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:56,380
And to make matters worse, the hard drive barely works either at this point, crapping

100
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:01,180
out seemingly at random.

101
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,260
This not only froze the system constantly, but the entire drive eventually refused to

102
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,260
show up in the BIOS at all.

103
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,620
And yes, I've taken everything apart, reseeded all the things and put the machine back together

104
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,460
half a dozen times, but that cranky old 63 megabyte quantum go drive just wants me to

105
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,900
get off its lawn and let it rest in peace.

106
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,540
I ended up getting a blank refurbished one that works perfectly, but even after days

107
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,340
of trying I haven't been able to get the old drive working again to make a backup,

108
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,460
and I don't have copies of the original software either.

109
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:36,500
Ah well, at least this gives us an excuse to gaze upon its delightful internals, which

110
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,500
really looks a lot like a laptop smashed together without the keyboard and with some extra circuitry

111
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,740
for the touchscreen.

112
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,660
Speaking of which, the Pen Master relies on a chipset by none other than Wacom Company

113
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:52,660
Limited, who made several pioneering pen controlled computing products and still sells digital

114
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,100
drawing devices today.

115
00:07:54,540 --> 00:08:00,220
Also making a standout appearance is that lovely Intel 386SL20 CPU with an accompanying

116
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,260
socket ready to make use of a 387 math coprocessor.

117
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:08,940
And up above that, there's the small but densely populated power supply board right

118
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:15,180
next to the internal PC speaker and the Tataran TL5186 coin cell for the CMOS in real-time

119
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,180
clock.

120
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,020
Yeah, overall I'd say Samsung did a nice job fitting so much into a relatively small

121
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,780
package considering the early 90s tech they were working with.

122
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:29,220
The chunky battery, 2.5-inch hard drive and full-sized IOPorts bulk this thing up quite

123
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,220
a bit.

124
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,420
It was a long way to go in optimizing portable computing tech, that's for sure.

125
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:39,460
And that's about it for the Samsung Pen Master, a fascinating early entry into the tablet

126
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,820
PC marketplace.

127
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:46,300
The one that didn't make much of a lasting impression, it seems.

128
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,780
That was undoubtedly due in part to its limited distribution and lofty price point, but also

129
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:55,340
because this was Samsung's first tablet and one that was simply early to the tablet

130
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,180
party in general.

131
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,540
Exciting as they were in 1992, tablets really didn't become a thing until the 2010s, and

132
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:07,420
even then when Samsung released their first Android tablet, the Galaxy Tab, I recall plenty

133
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:12,420
of naysayers and derisive opinions questioning who actually needed a tablet computer.

134
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,660
Samsung strikes me as one of those companies that throws every new form factor at the wall

135
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,500
to see what sticks, even if the timing isn't exactly optimal.

136
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:26,300
And the Pen Master is an enjoyable example of that from all the way back in 1992.

137
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,540
You know, I don't really have any profound point to make here except to say that I'm

138
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:35,100
continually amused by the fast-moving trends in tech and how quickly consumers collectively

139
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,420
forget the numerous milestones along the way to where we are now.

140
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,260
Forgotten devices like the Pen Master paved the way for the future, at least in some small

141
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,460
part decades in advance.

142
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:58,500
And for that, I think things like this deserve a second look.

143
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,540
If you enjoyed this look at the Pen Master, might I suggest my video on the Dauphin DTR-1,

144
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,780
or any number of other bits of retro tech history?

145
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,500
I cover a lot of stuff here on LGR.

146
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,060
As always though, thank you very much for watching.
