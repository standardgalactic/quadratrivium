0	11200	Greetings and welcome to an LGR thing, and this lovely device is the Samsung PenMaster
11200	17520	386SL20, a touchscreen tablet computer from 1992.
17520	25160	Back then, this started at a price of $3,995, with costs heading upwards of $5,000 for a
25160	28400	fully-specced example with additional storage.
28400	32480	While being that this was Samsung's first tablet computer on the market, and one that
32480	37760	packed an impressive 386 MS-DOS PC inside, it's little wonder that it cost half as much
37760	41120	as a 1992 GeoStorm back then.
41120	47160	Shout out to Lorne, by the way, an LGR viewer who sent this example for me to review.
47160	52120	These are not common machines whatsoever, especially this particular model from Samsung.
52120	55120	Ooh, and he also included some Chicago popcorn.
55120	56360	What's this?
56360	57360	Caramel and cheese?
57360	60080	Mmm, that's some tasty stuff.
60080	62040	But yeah, anyway, the PenMaster.
62040	69080	It's pretty large, by today's tablet standards, measuring 11.5 x 9.5 x 1.8 inches, and weighing
69080	74040	in at 5.5 pounds, or 2.5 kilograms, with the battery installed.
74040	78160	But back when it was one of the brand new, pen-based computer systems debuting at the
78160	82240	1991 Fall Comdex show, this was darned impressive.
82240	87320	So much so that portable computing pioneer grid systems licensed the design from Samsung
87600	92920	and sold their own slightly better-known variant called the GridPad SL.
92920	96360	Believe it or not, Grid and Samsung weren't the only companies releasing cutting-edge
96360	98400	tablets in the early 90s either.
98400	103960	The PenMaster was introduced right alongside offerings from Momenta, TelePad, and Dolphin
103960	105320	Technology.
105320	109120	If that last one sounds familiar, perhaps you've seen my previous video about the Dolphin
109120	110120	DTR-1.
110120	114920	That was a pretty similar tablet PC in many respects, even running the same base operating
114920	120640	environment as the PenMaster, yet it didn't hit the market until a year later, in 1993.
120640	125000	On the timescale of early 90s computing, that may as well be an eternity, so let's take
125000	130680	a look at what Samsung was doing in these earlier days of touchscreen tablet PCs.
130680	135720	As its name implies, the PenMaster comes with a pen suitable for all manner of mastering
135720	140280	outfitted in a blue plastic body matching the word pen in the logo.
140280	144880	It has a single button on the side for right-clicking, and the pen position can even be detected
145080	148520	a centimeter away from the surface of the tablet screen.
148520	152600	So yeah, the pen is battery-powered and was pretty advanced for the time, with replacements
152600	155520	from Samsung costing 80 bucks each.
155520	160600	Naturally, this is intended to work with the resistive touchscreen display here, a backlit
160600	166480	10-inch monochrome LCD panel that displays VGA in up to 32 shades of gray, coincidentally
166480	168760	the title of my upcoming romance novel.
168760	172680	And along the top of the device, there's an assortment of stubby sliding switches,
172680	178600	including the power, brightness, and contrast controls, a tiny reset button, and LED indicators
178600	180600	for power and hard disk activity.
180600	185400	A majority of the I.O. functionality is found on the right-hand side, with a spot for the
185400	192680	17.5 volt DC power brick, a PS2 keyboard port, 9-pin serial port, Samsung floppy drive interface,
192680	198280	parallel port, VGA video output, and a 2400 BPS datafax modem.
198280	203240	On the left-hand side of the unit is where you get the single PCMCIA slot for expansion
203240	204240	cards.
204240	208920	On top is where the rechargeable 1.7 amp hour battery is installed, which originally boasted
208920	213680	a 2-hour battery life, and along the bottom edge is absolutely nothing.
213680	215560	Just a nice rounded butt.
215560	221640	And underneath is all the expected model number and FCC text, as well as 4 rubber feet, signaling
221640	224280	how it's built for plopping down on a flat surface.
224280	228680	Yeah, at 5.5 pounds and a couple inches thick, it's just not the type of tablet you want
228680	230800	to hold in your hands for very long.
230800	234360	However you choose to set it up, though, the main thing to do is make sure it's charged
234360	237080	up or plugged in so you can get it turned on.
243240	248120	At this point, the PenMaster boots up like any PC of the time period, performs the standard
248120	251840	hardware checks, and begins loading the operating system.
251840	257880	Go corporations PenPoint and CIC PenDOS were both available as options from Samsung, but
257880	262360	this one came with Microsoft Windows for pen computing version 1.0.
262360	267400	Based on Windows 3.1 for desktops, it'll feel darn familiar to anyone used to that,
267400	271680	with the main additions being the Microsoft PenTools applications.
271680	276240	Things like the pen palette for handwriting recognition, the training program for helping
276240	280100	you to understand your sloppy handwriting, and the on-screen keyboard for when all other
280100	282740	inputs inevitably fall flat on their face.
282740	287820	There's also the handy notebook application, much more involved than good ol' notepad.
287820	291660	This is meant to take the place of a personal organizer and rid your life of pesky paper
291660	293740	calendars once and for all.
293740	294740	In theory.
294740	299220	Yeah, all this handwriting recognition stuff with Windows for pen computing never really
299220	302860	struck me as something I'd want to use for anything more than a few minutes.
302860	306940	Once the novelty of it actually recognizing a few simple words wears off, you're left
306940	310160	struggling with the awkwardness of everything else.
310160	314700	Even after training the software, errors are commonplace, and the fact that the remainder
314700	319220	of the Windows interface is basically unchanged from the desktop PC version doesn't do it
319220	321740	any favors in terms of usability.
321740	327540	At the same time, though, this was 1992, and the pen master was like a glimpse into the
327540	328620	future.
328620	333940	It was a portable touchscreen computer with an integrated 20 MHz 3 to 6 SLCPU and up
333940	338540	to 20 megs of RAM, more than enough to take on most anything you'd care to throw at an
338540	340300	early 90s tablet.
340300	343820	Which nowadays, I mean, is mostly gonna be solitaire in paintbrush, amirite?
343820	348540	Sure, it cost between four and five grand when it was new, but come on, screwing around
348540	353660	with classic Windows 3 applications using a touchscreen and a stylus is just a giggle-worthy
353660	354660	spectacle.
354660	359060	Especially since it's on hardware that was absolutely at the forefront for the time period,
359060	362220	rarely used by the average home computer user.
362220	366260	It's no surprise that a good number of the pen master machines from both Samsung and
366260	371380	Grid ended up being sold directly to professionals instead of through general retail.
371380	375220	After all, its price and functionality fit more in line with the needs of government,
375220	379780	medical, business, and education sectors, not the rando at Radio Shack who just wants
379780	381780	to play Wolfenstein 3D.
381780	385980	Not to say you couldn't play Wolfenstein 3D on here, it's certainly capable of doing
385980	391020	so, but there were a thousand cheaper and more suitable options for that in 1992.
391020	395260	Even as much as I love to show something like Wolfenstein 3D running on here, unfortunately
395260	397820	I ran into some roadblocks preventing that.
397820	402380	For one thing, the three and a half inch floppy drive it came with no longer reads disquets
402380	412180	at all, making this rather concerning noise anytime you try.
412180	416380	And to make matters worse, the hard drive barely works either at this point, crapping
416380	421180	out seemingly at random.
421180	426260	This not only froze the system constantly, but the entire drive eventually refused to
426260	428260	show up in the BIOS at all.
428260	432620	And yes, I've taken everything apart, reseeded all the things and put the machine back together
432620	437460	half a dozen times, but that cranky old 63 megabyte quantum go drive just wants me to
437460	439900	get off its lawn and let it rest in peace.
439900	444540	I ended up getting a blank refurbished one that works perfectly, but even after days
444540	448340	of trying I haven't been able to get the old drive working again to make a backup,
448340	451460	and I don't have copies of the original software either.
451460	456500	Ah well, at least this gives us an excuse to gaze upon its delightful internals, which
456500	461500	really looks a lot like a laptop smashed together without the keyboard and with some extra circuitry
461500	462740	for the touchscreen.
462740	467660	Speaking of which, the Pen Master relies on a chipset by none other than Wacom Company
467660	472660	Limited, who made several pioneering pen controlled computing products and still sells digital
472660	474100	drawing devices today.
474540	480220	Also making a standout appearance is that lovely Intel 386SL20 CPU with an accompanying
480220	484260	socket ready to make use of a 387 math coprocessor.
484260	488940	And up above that, there's the small but densely populated power supply board right
488940	495180	next to the internal PC speaker and the Tataran TL5186 coin cell for the CMOS in real-time
495180	496180	clock.
496180	500020	Yeah, overall I'd say Samsung did a nice job fitting so much into a relatively small
500020	503780	package considering the early 90s tech they were working with.
503780	509220	The chunky battery, 2.5-inch hard drive and full-sized IOPorts bulk this thing up quite
509220	510220	a bit.
510220	514420	It was a long way to go in optimizing portable computing tech, that's for sure.
514420	519460	And that's about it for the Samsung Pen Master, a fascinating early entry into the tablet
519460	520820	PC marketplace.
520820	526300	The one that didn't make much of a lasting impression, it seems.
526300	530780	That was undoubtedly due in part to its limited distribution and lofty price point, but also
530780	535340	because this was Samsung's first tablet and one that was simply early to the tablet
535340	537180	party in general.
537180	542540	Exciting as they were in 1992, tablets really didn't become a thing until the 2010s, and
542540	547420	even then when Samsung released their first Android tablet, the Galaxy Tab, I recall plenty
547420	552420	of naysayers and derisive opinions questioning who actually needed a tablet computer.
552420	556660	Samsung strikes me as one of those companies that throws every new form factor at the wall
556660	560500	to see what sticks, even if the timing isn't exactly optimal.
560500	566300	And the Pen Master is an enjoyable example of that from all the way back in 1992.
566300	569540	You know, I don't really have any profound point to make here except to say that I'm
569540	575100	continually amused by the fast-moving trends in tech and how quickly consumers collectively
575100	579420	forget the numerous milestones along the way to where we are now.
579420	584260	Forgotten devices like the Pen Master paved the way for the future, at least in some small
584260	586460	part decades in advance.
586460	598500	And for that, I think things like this deserve a second look.
598500	603540	If you enjoyed this look at the Pen Master, might I suggest my video on the Dauphin DTR-1,
603540	605780	or any number of other bits of retro tech history?
605780	608500	I cover a lot of stuff here on LGR.
608500	611060	As always though, thank you very much for watching.
