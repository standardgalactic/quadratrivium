0	8260	Hi all, it is of course completely presumptuous of me to dare to write and broadcast a video
8260	13760	entitled Message to the Christian Churches, but I'm going to do it anyway because I have
13760	19960	something to say and because that something needs to be said.
19960	25320	I've been speaking to and watching and listening to audiences all over the Western world for
25320	33720	the past four years, in person and in virtual form, and have learned a few things in consequence.
33720	39960	It all started in some sense with the lectures I did on Genesis in 2017.
39960	45880	My family and I took a risk and rented out a theatre in Toronto on the off chance that
45880	50560	there might be an audience for what might be described as a psychological approach to
50560	58160	our ancient stories and, lo and behold, and Miracle of Miracles, there was.
58160	66200	I completed 15 or so lectures walking through the first Biblical book, sold out the theatre,
66200	75440	and attracted, surprisingly, millions of viewers, Christians, Jews, Muslims, and atheists,
75440	81200	and most of the people who attended lives, and the majority of those who watched online
81200	83260	were young men.
83260	90660	That is not a phenomenon that can be easily accounted for, but let me try.
90660	97640	Now in the West, because of the weight of historical guilt that is upon us, a variant of the sense
97640	104720	of original sin in a very real sense, and because of a very real attempt by those possessed
104720	111200	by what might be described as unhelpful ideas to weaponize that guilt, our young people
111200	116260	face a demoralization that is perhaps unparalleled.
116260	123180	This is particularly true of young men, although anything that devastates young men will eventually
123180	126080	do the same to young women.
126080	133100	And that, in this era of anti-natalism and equally reprehensible nihilism, is precisely
133100	134980	the point.
134980	141140	When they are children, boys are hectic for their toy preferences, which often include
141140	146420	toy weapons such as guns, and they're more boisterous playing style, as boys require
146420	152700	active rough-and-tumble play, even more than girls, for whom it is also a necessity.
152700	159020	When in grade school, boys are admonished, shamed, and controlled in a very similar manner
159220	164420	By those who think that play is unnecessary, particularly if it's competitive, and who
164420	173900	value a docile, harmless obedience above all, shades of Dolores Umbridge, following all
173900	181500	that, because that's not enough, even when pursued assiduously for total demoralization,
181500	187580	is the inculcation of an extremely damaging ideology, which essentially consists of three
188340	190180	accusations.
190180	196900	Number one, human culture, particularly in the West, is best construed as an oppressive
196900	204900	patriarchy, motivated by the desire, willingness, and ability to use power, defined as the compulsion
204900	211180	of others against their will, to attain what our purely selfish and self-serving ends.
211180	215300	This is true at every level of analysis.
215300	221060	Marriage is akin to slavery, friendship to exploitation, political disagreement to war,
221060	225780	and business arrangements to deception and theft.
225780	231180	And this is true not only of the current social arrangements that characterize our culture,
231180	238460	particularly in the West, but also the fundamental reality of history itself.
238460	246340	Number two, human activity, particularly that undertaken in the West, is fundamentally
246340	249580	a planet-disspoiling enterprise.
249580	254900	The human race is a threat to the ecological utopia that existed before us, and that could
254900	258660	hypothetically exist in our absence.
258660	264380	We might well be construed even as a cancer that threatens the very viability of the complex
264380	271100	systems that make up the ecosystem of the Earth that shelters and supports us.
271100	277220	We are facing a Malthusian catastrophe of overpopulation and biosphere degradation.
277220	283380	And we have to place extreme limits on our wants, even our needs, so that survival itself,
283380	289500	even in a much reduced form, can be guaranteed.
289500	296060	Number three, the prime contributor both to the tyranny that makes up the oppressive patriarchy
296060	302420	and structures all of our social interactions, past and present, and the unforgivable dispoiling
302420	308460	of our beloved Mother Earth is damnable male ambition, competitive and dominating,
308460	314540	power-mad, selfish, exploitative, raping and pillaging.
314540	318060	You might think that I'm overstating the case.
318060	320380	Think again, sunshine.
320380	326900	We in the West are facing an all-out assault at the deepest levels on what that old Joker
326900	334800	Jacques Derrida deemed the foul, logo-centric conceptual structure of civilization itself.
334800	341780	To take that apart, that's a society centered on the encouraging, adventurous, masculine
341780	349020	spirit and that privileges that hated word of all things, the divine logos.
349020	355540	And what should we worship and celebrate properly other than that, deconstructionists, the words
355540	359460	of that mass murderer Karl Marx?
359460	364020	And it is precisely those young men who are deeply conscientious, capable of guilt and
364020	370300	regret, who have come to believe in pain that every deep impulse that moves them out into
370300	376540	the world for the adventure of their life, even that impulse drawing them to women, is
376540	383100	nothing but the manifestation of a spirit that is essentially satanic in nature.
383100	390980	This is not only wrong, theologically, morally, psychologically, practically and scientifically.
390980	393180	It is literally anti-true.
393180	399900	It's not a mere misstatement about the nature of reality, a minor conceptual error, but
399900	406060	something that literally could not be farther from the truth, and something that distant
406060	412860	from the truth comes from a place that cannot be distinguished from hell.
412860	418340	The Christian Church is there to remind people, young men included, and perhaps even first
418340	425260	and foremost, that they have a woman to find, a garden to walk in, a family to nurture,
425260	432060	an ark to build, a land to conquer, a ladder to heaven to build, and the utter terrible
432060	443260	catastrophe of life to face stalwartly in truth devoted to love and without fear.
443260	446180	Invite the young men back.
446180	453980	Say literally to those young men, you are welcome here if no one else wants what you
453980	455900	have to offer.
455900	457180	We do.
457180	460460	We want to call you to the highest purpose of your life.
460460	466420	We want your time and energy and effort and your will and your goodwill.
466420	473980	We want to work with you to make things better, to produce life more abundant for you and
473980	480340	for your wife and children and for your community and your country and the world.
480340	482100	And we have our problems.
482100	488740	In the Christian Church, we are more abundant, sometimes far too often corrupt, and sometimes
488740	489900	deeply so.
489900	496260	We are outdated, as are all institutions with their roots in the dead, but still often wise
496260	497820	past.
497820	500740	So join us.
500740	509420	We'll help fix you up, and you can help fix us up, and together we'll aim up.
509420	514420	But here is a message to those young men skeptical about such things.
514420	516780	What else do you have?
516780	520420	You can abandon the churches in your cynicism and disbelief.
520420	525300	You can say to yourself, narcissistically and solipsistically, the church does not express
525300	529500	what I believe properly.
529500	532180	Who cares what you believe?
532180	534700	Why is this about you?
534700	538420	Do you even want it to be about you?
538420	540100	What if it was about others?
540100	545400	What if it was about your duty to the past and to the broader community that surrounds
545400	547980	you in the present?
547980	553860	What if it was incumbent upon you and vital to your health and willingness even to live
553860	559860	to rescue your dead father from the belly of the beast, where he has always resided,
559860	563220	and to restore him to life?
563220	572340	Once again to the churches, Protestant, you're the worst at the moment, Catholic, Orthodox.
572340	580220	Invite young men, put up a billboard, say, young men are welcome here.
580220	583980	Print some flyers and put them in a box by the billboard.
583980	588820	Signal the existence of those flyers with an arrow, with the words, more information
588820	591940	about attending here.
591940	596820	Tell those who have never been in a church exactly what to do, how to dress, when to
596820	604940	show up, who to contact, and most importantly, what they can do.
604940	609620	Ask more, not less of those you are inviting.
609620	613580	Ask more of them than anyone ever has.
613580	621580	Remind them who they are in the deepest sense and help them become that.
621580	626740	For churches, for God's sake, quit fighting for social justice.
626740	630620	Quit saving the bloody planet.
630620	632980	Attend to some souls.
632980	635340	That's what you're supposed to do.
635340	638100	That's your holy duty.
638100	643340	Do it now, before it's too late.
643340	645020	The hour is nigh.
