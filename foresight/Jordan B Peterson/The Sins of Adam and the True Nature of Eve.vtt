00:00.000 --> 00:04.680
Good evening and welcome to Dr. Jordan B. Peterson's We Who

00:04.680 --> 00:06.680
Wrestle With God Tour.

00:37.480 --> 00:40.680
All these great bands, and here you are tonight.

00:42.680 --> 00:44.180
Well, thank you very much for coming.

00:44.180 --> 00:45.880
Let me tell you what's going to happen tonight.

00:45.880 --> 00:49.480
I'm going to share my thoughts with you.

00:50.580 --> 00:53.280
For 70 minutes, thereabouts.

00:54.080 --> 00:56.380
Then I have a special guest here,

00:56.380 --> 00:59.580
Konstantin Kizin, who runs a podcast.

01:02.380 --> 01:03.980
Good. Well, you should know about him.

01:03.980 --> 01:06.480
Definitely crazy Russian from the UK.

01:07.580 --> 01:17.980
A real voice of reason for our fellow Westerners in the UK.

01:17.980 --> 01:24.480
Konstantin is going to come out on stage and torture me about what I said, I hope.

01:24.480 --> 01:30.780
Well, what I'm hoping, Konstantin is a very clear thinker, very witty man.

01:30.780 --> 01:32.480
He's got a very sharp mind.

01:32.480 --> 01:35.380
He's critically oriented in the best possible way.

01:35.780 --> 01:38.980
A good critical mind separates the wheat from the chaff, right?

01:38.980 --> 01:44.280
Because to be property critical isn't to hurt or destroy with criticism.

01:44.280 --> 01:48.280
It's to separate what's truly valuable from what isn't valuable,

01:48.280 --> 01:50.380
so that you have solid ground to stand on.

01:50.380 --> 01:54.580
And, you know, one of the things that I strive to do in my whole academic career

01:54.580 --> 02:01.880
is to move closer and closer to believing and stating and writing things

02:01.880 --> 02:06.080
that I can't, I can't move.

02:07.080 --> 02:17.580
And you do that yourself by subjecting your own presumptions to critical analysis.

02:17.580 --> 02:20.880
You do that so that you think through what you're doing

02:20.880 --> 02:25.680
so that you don't act out your stupid ideas in the world and die.

02:25.680 --> 02:27.980
And that's the purpose of thinking, right?

02:27.980 --> 02:35.580
Seriously, the purpose of thinking is to have your stupid ideas die instead of you.

02:35.580 --> 02:38.580
And that's part of the reason why your enemy can be your best friend.

02:38.580 --> 02:41.780
Because if someone can take out something you think

02:41.780 --> 02:46.180
because they can show you how it's erroneous and counterproductive

02:46.180 --> 02:50.780
and then you don't have to go through all the trouble of learning that stupidly in the world,

02:50.780 --> 02:52.580
that's a fine gift.

02:52.580 --> 02:58.880
And so, I'm hoping that Constantine can stand in for the audience,

02:58.880 --> 03:01.080
for the critical and skeptical audience.

03:01.080 --> 03:03.680
We're talking about very difficult issues.

03:03.680 --> 03:11.680
It's highly likely that I could formulate what I'm stating more clearly and precisely.

03:11.680 --> 03:19.280
And so, Constantine will come out and we'll discuss what was presented tonight

03:19.280 --> 03:25.080
and then we'll turn to the questions that you've kindly delivered and discussed those.

03:25.080 --> 03:30.780
And then we'll reintroduce the band and that should do for the evening.

03:30.780 --> 03:33.480
And so, that's the plan.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.180
And so, away we go.

03:36.180 --> 03:38.580
I'm very much looking forward to this.

03:39.080 --> 03:53.380
So, the first thing we're going to talk about is we're going to talk about stories and set the stage.

03:53.380 --> 04:03.880
I think we're at a crucial inflection point in the world, culturally and philosophically.

04:03.980 --> 04:08.880
I think we're on the dawn of a new set of realizations,

04:08.880 --> 04:13.880
a new set of realizations that will return us to our fundamentals.

04:13.880 --> 04:17.780
I think the reason that we have a culture war raging in the West,

04:17.780 --> 04:20.080
why there's so much instability,

04:20.080 --> 04:25.480
is because something new is struggling to be born or reborn.

04:25.480 --> 04:29.680
And I want to explain the reason for that first.

04:29.680 --> 04:37.680
And the reason is that the enlightenment view of the world,

04:37.680 --> 04:43.480
which has guided our technological and scientific endeavor, our conceptual endeavor,

04:43.480 --> 04:49.580
our philosophical endeavor for a few hundred years,

04:49.580 --> 04:53.180
is there's something about it that's wrong, like deeply wrong.

04:53.180 --> 05:00.980
And that error is making itself manifest in the scientific community,

05:00.980 --> 05:07.280
because I would say now that scientists themselves from a multitude of different disciplines

05:07.280 --> 05:14.280
understand that the idea that we see the world as a place of facts,

05:14.280 --> 05:17.780
or that we see the world as rational creatures,

05:17.780 --> 05:22.880
or that you can even see the world that way is wrong.

05:23.280 --> 05:26.680
And I believe that it's been demonstrated to be wrong.

05:26.680 --> 05:30.580
This isn't a matter of mere philosophical opinion anymore,

05:30.580 --> 05:32.780
although it's also that.

05:32.780 --> 05:39.180
One example, for example, is that the newest artificial intelligence systems

05:39.180 --> 05:43.480
that we've designed, the large language models that have burst onto the stage

05:43.480 --> 05:49.080
in the last year, or thereabouts, ChatGPT, the catastrophic Gemini

05:49.080 --> 05:55.280
that Google so foolishly launched, Elon Musk's GROC,

05:55.280 --> 05:59.680
these systems are trained like human beings are trained.

05:59.680 --> 06:02.480
They have a name, they have a purpose.

06:02.480 --> 06:06.780
They were trained with reward and punishment, so to speak,

06:06.780 --> 06:09.180
their approximations to a target.

06:09.180 --> 06:13.480
They see the world through a structure of value

06:13.480 --> 06:16.780
that they have absorbed from human beings

06:16.780 --> 06:21.980
to make the world's smartest linguistic machines.

06:21.980 --> 06:25.880
We had to inculcate in them a structure of value.

06:25.880 --> 06:31.880
Okay, and so, and we produced machines now that can engage in discourse,

06:31.880 --> 06:35.280
that can use language in a way that's virtually indistinguishable from the human,

06:35.280 --> 06:41.880
and it's going to become radically indistinguishable from the human very, very rapidly.

06:41.880 --> 06:46.480
And they're not programmed like lists of rules.

06:46.480 --> 06:51.680
They're not programmed like ordinary thinking machines.

06:51.680 --> 06:53.880
They're programmed the same way that human beings learn.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.580
They're programmed with aim.

06:55.580 --> 07:01.180
They have an ethos and an ethic.

07:01.180 --> 07:08.580
We can't orient ourselves in the world with the facts.

07:08.580 --> 07:13.780
We can't follow the science because science isn't a leader.

07:13.880 --> 07:17.180
Science doesn't establish our aims.

07:17.180 --> 07:22.380
Our aims are established using mechanisms of perception and emotion

07:22.380 --> 07:26.080
and thought that aren't in themselves scientific.

07:26.080 --> 07:30.180
We're aiming at something.

07:30.180 --> 07:36.280
Why can't we orient ourselves in the world with the facts?

07:36.280 --> 07:41.280
Well, the simplest explanation for that is that

07:41.280 --> 07:44.080
there are too many facts.

07:44.080 --> 07:48.980
There's as many facts as there are phenomena.

07:48.980 --> 07:55.580
More, actually, there's as many facts as there are possible combinations of phenomena.

07:55.580 --> 07:57.880
You drown in the facts.

07:57.880 --> 08:02.880
When you're confused in your own life and things are chaotic and you're anxious,

08:02.880 --> 08:09.180
it's because a plethora of possibilities is making itself manifest in front of you

08:09.180 --> 08:11.280
and you don't know which way to turn.

08:11.280 --> 08:12.580
You don't have a clear direction.

08:12.580 --> 08:13.580
You don't have a clear aim.

08:13.580 --> 08:17.980
There's no way of simplifying the world so that you can act in it.

08:17.980 --> 08:21.080
We know, for example, that to perceive the world,

08:21.080 --> 08:27.680
you have to obliterate from your consciousness almost everything that you could see

08:27.680 --> 08:31.480
because otherwise you're overwhelmed.

08:31.480 --> 08:37.580
We know even that the hallucinogens who are being studied with increasing intensity

08:37.580 --> 08:46.180
in recent years interfere with your normal perception such that they bring to consciousness

08:46.180 --> 08:51.180
a plethora of things that under normal circumstances you ignore.

08:51.180 --> 08:58.580
And the consequence of that is influx of a sense of overwhelming significance and meaning,

08:58.580 --> 09:05.020
but at the same time a kind of paralysis of action because when everything becomes

09:05.120 --> 09:10.620
infinitely meaningful, there's no straightforward way of moving forward.

09:10.620 --> 09:13.920
When you're in a restaurant with someone on a first date

09:13.920 --> 09:19.020
and you're focusing on the conversation and actions of your date,

09:19.020 --> 09:24.320
in a sea of competing conversations,

09:24.320 --> 09:30.320
you zero out everything that you could be attending to in every other table,

09:30.320 --> 09:33.220
all the competing thoughts in your imagination,

09:33.220 --> 09:40.020
all the things you could be bringing to mind to zero in with like laser pinpoint accuracy

09:40.020 --> 09:44.020
on what it is that your partner in conversation is doing.

09:44.020 --> 09:46.220
And you do that in the world all the time.

09:46.220 --> 09:51.220
You make one thing at a time of pinnacle importance

09:51.220 --> 09:57.120
and you arrange everything else in the world at every moment that you perceive

09:57.120 --> 10:01.420
around that thing that you've made of pinnacle importance.

10:01.420 --> 10:04.820
That's how you see the world and I don't mean think about the world.

10:04.820 --> 10:06.820
This is under thought.

10:06.820 --> 10:09.220
It's more profound.

10:09.220 --> 10:13.520
It's what you do when you actually see.

10:13.520 --> 10:24.920
If I decide to do something straightforward like walk from here to the stairs on the stage

10:24.920 --> 10:31.520
and I set my aim, I don't perceive any of you in consequence

10:31.520 --> 10:38.220
because the fact of your existence is irrelevant to my purpose and you're gone.

10:38.220 --> 10:46.820
None of the facts of the stage that I could attend to are relevant and perceptible anymore

10:46.820 --> 10:57.320
except in so far as their pathways or facilitators or obstacles to my journey forward.

10:57.320 --> 11:03.020
If I'm looking to the stairs, I see the chairs but not as places to sit.

11:03.020 --> 11:09.220
I see them as obstacles that I have to circumvent in order to attain my aim.

11:09.220 --> 11:16.320
Everything that you see in the world makes itself manifest in accordance with your aim.

11:16.320 --> 11:25.220
And that's a radically, revolutionarily different way of conceptualizing the world than the notion

11:25.220 --> 11:32.020
that you take the facts and you sort them despite their infinite number

11:32.020 --> 11:37.420
and calculate your way with the facts rationally forward.

11:37.420 --> 11:39.720
That's not what you do.

11:39.720 --> 11:48.420
All right, here's a proposition to contemplate.

11:48.420 --> 11:52.120
It's another proposition that has revolutionary significance.

11:52.120 --> 11:59.120
It'll explain all sorts of things that you know to be true but don't know why they're true.

11:59.120 --> 12:11.020
The description of the structure through which you see the world is a story.

12:11.020 --> 12:12.220
That's what a story is.

12:12.220 --> 12:21.820
Okay, so now this explains many things that are otherwise left as mysteries or side effects.

12:21.820 --> 12:23.620
I read a book by Stephen Pinker once.

12:23.620 --> 12:28.420
Pinker's an Enlightenment rationalist from Harvard and a good guy and very smart

12:28.420 --> 12:31.220
and much of what he says is extraordinarily useful.

12:31.220 --> 12:38.020
But he believes, for example, that our proclivity to enjoy and tell stories is like a side effect

12:38.020 --> 12:40.820
of something more fundamental cognitively.

12:40.820 --> 12:43.720
It's the story as entertainment theory.

12:43.720 --> 12:46.320
You go to a movie because it's fun.

12:46.320 --> 12:50.220
You read a book of fiction to your child because it's fun.

12:50.220 --> 12:54.120
It's not core to the...

12:54.120 --> 12:54.820
What would you say?

12:54.820 --> 12:59.920
It's not a core element of the way that you exist in the world.

12:59.920 --> 13:05.320
It's mere entertainment.

13:05.320 --> 13:07.920
It misses the point that theory.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.620
Why is it entertaining?

13:10.620 --> 13:13.820
Why can you teach children with stories?

13:13.820 --> 13:20.920
If you get the story right for a child, you can capture the child's interest and you can integrate

13:20.920 --> 13:23.520
almost any form of learning into the story.

13:23.520 --> 13:25.420
And the child will be captivated by that.

13:25.420 --> 13:32.620
When children play, pretend play, which they do spontaneously, they spontaneously dramatize the world.

13:32.620 --> 13:41.020
They spontaneously make stories out of their roles and their destinies.

13:41.020 --> 13:44.320
And that captures them.

13:44.320 --> 13:46.620
That forms the basis of their friendships.

13:46.620 --> 13:53.420
That's why children want to play so frenetically is that they're practicing modeling the world.

13:53.420 --> 13:58.920
When you go see a movie, it's not that you want to be entertained, although it is entertaining.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.620
That's not why you're there.

14:00.620 --> 14:02.720
It's not for fun either.

14:02.720 --> 14:05.720
That's easy to understand and to see.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.820
What's fun about a horror movie?

14:08.820 --> 14:10.020
I'm dead serious.

14:10.020 --> 14:17.420
It's like people will be so afraid in a horror movie that they'll cover their eyes.

14:17.420 --> 14:20.120
They'll hide behind the chair in front of them.

14:20.120 --> 14:24.120
They'll ask themselves afterwards why they even put themselves through it.

14:24.120 --> 14:27.320
And yet they'll line up and pay to do it.

14:27.320 --> 14:34.320
Well, why would you line up and pay to torture yourself?

14:34.320 --> 14:42.720
Well, because you want to know how to deal with what's horrifying.

14:42.720 --> 14:47.720
And you want to practice that in a way, if you can, that isn't in itself fatal.

14:47.720 --> 14:52.260
You want to expose yourself to the catastrophes of existence so that you're prepared when

14:52.260 --> 14:54.120
those catastrophes come along.

14:54.120 --> 14:59.520
You want to expose yourself to the predators that lurk everywhere.

14:59.520 --> 15:04.920
You want to inure yourself against what's disgusting and contaminating because you're

15:04.920 --> 15:06.860
going to have to deal with it.

15:06.860 --> 15:11.960
You want to expose yourself to what's frightening so that you can find the courage within you

15:11.960 --> 15:14.000
to deal with what's frightening.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.640
And that's part of the instinct to develop and expand your competence.

15:18.640 --> 15:24.920
And it's in that expansion of competence and skill that occurs as a consequence of that

15:24.920 --> 15:29.440
voluntary exposure that the entertainment is situated.

15:29.440 --> 15:34.520
The reason that's entertaining is because it's part of the manner in which you expand

15:34.520 --> 15:36.280
yourself.

15:36.280 --> 15:41.240
And you can do that in the direction of what's dark and terrible just as you can in the direction

15:41.240 --> 15:43.840
of say what's heroic.

15:43.840 --> 15:46.560
What do you do when you go to a movie?

15:46.560 --> 15:51.640
You fasten on to a character and you understand that character the same way that you understand

15:51.640 --> 15:53.600
people that you're in conversation with.

15:53.600 --> 15:57.880
Now you might think that the way that you understand people is by you listen to what

15:57.880 --> 16:03.280
they say and you extract out the knowledge that they're delivering to you in terms of

16:03.280 --> 16:07.680
facts and you interpret the facts and you derive your understanding of the person.

16:07.680 --> 16:10.240
Like none of that's true.

16:10.240 --> 16:14.520
That has absolutely nothing to do with how you establish a relationship with someone.

16:14.520 --> 16:16.280
And well here's some proof.

16:16.280 --> 16:19.400
Is that what you do with a dog?

16:19.400 --> 16:24.320
Well obviously not, but you can establish a relationship with a dog.

16:24.320 --> 16:29.000
And the relationship you have with a dog, it's not the same as the relationship with

16:29.000 --> 16:33.640
a person, but a dog's a pack animal and a dog can become a member of the family.

16:33.640 --> 16:39.560
You can understand a dog well enough so the dog likes you.

16:39.560 --> 16:46.320
Right, and so whatever you're doing with the dog, it isn't discourse about propositions

16:46.320 --> 16:50.600
because most of the dogs you own don't talk.

16:50.600 --> 16:59.000
So and it's the same with very young children and it's the same with an infant.

16:59.000 --> 17:04.520
You establish a relationship using mechanisms that aren't propositional.

17:04.520 --> 17:08.080
They're not rules, they're not descriptions, they're not facts.

17:08.080 --> 17:09.600
That's not how you do it.

17:09.600 --> 17:10.600
How do you do it?

17:10.600 --> 17:13.400
Where do you look when you talk to someone?

17:13.400 --> 17:15.760
You look at their eyes.

17:15.760 --> 17:17.000
Why?

17:17.000 --> 17:19.240
To see where they're pointing them.

17:19.240 --> 17:20.240
Why?

17:20.240 --> 17:22.720
So you can see what they're looking at.

17:22.720 --> 17:24.560
Why?

17:24.560 --> 17:29.200
So you can infer what's important to them because we point our eyes at that which is

17:29.200 --> 17:30.480
important to us.

17:30.480 --> 17:34.160
That's why our eyes look the way they look.

17:34.160 --> 17:39.520
Black in the middle, colored on the ring around that against the white background.

17:39.520 --> 17:40.680
That's an evolved mechanism.

17:40.680 --> 17:42.800
I can see your eyes.

17:42.800 --> 17:50.360
All of our ancestors whose eyes weren't visible either got killed or didn't reproduce.

17:50.360 --> 17:54.040
The one thing you want to know about someone right away is where the hell their eyes are

17:54.040 --> 17:59.400
pointed and you can do that politely which you do by attending to someone without too

17:59.400 --> 18:01.600
predatory a stare.

18:01.600 --> 18:07.400
You do that by attending politely to their face but not too intensely and not attending

18:07.400 --> 18:12.860
let's say inappropriately to other parts of their body and they're going to be watching

18:12.860 --> 18:17.280
you to see what you do with your eyes because the one thing you want to know about someone

18:17.280 --> 18:21.080
above all else is what the hell are they up to?

18:21.080 --> 18:23.440
What's their aim?

18:23.440 --> 18:30.240
And so when you go to a movie that's what you do and you watch a character in a role.

18:30.240 --> 18:38.360
You see him in a variety of different situations and you watch how he structures his attention.

18:38.360 --> 18:40.120
What he pays attention to?

18:40.120 --> 18:45.920
His attention is a costly business and so people pay attention to what they value.

18:45.920 --> 18:52.880
You watch what they attend to and you watch how they prioritize their actions and from

18:52.880 --> 18:57.800
that you derive an understanding of what's important to them.

18:57.800 --> 19:01.720
As soon as you understand what's important to them you've got their aim.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.080
You figured that character out.

19:03.080 --> 19:07.280
This is what you do when you learn to know someone.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.160
What's their aim?

19:09.160 --> 19:16.640
As soon as you know their aim you can see the world through their eyes.

19:16.640 --> 19:22.840
You can see the same objects they see and the objects take on the same emotional significance.

19:23.200 --> 19:27.280
And when you say I come to understand someone what you really mean is, oh I understand their

19:27.280 --> 19:34.800
aim and now I can aim at the same thing, at least in simulation, at least fictionally,

19:34.800 --> 19:40.760
and I can come to inhabit the same world of perception and emotion that they inhabit.

19:40.760 --> 19:46.360
I can even guess at how they might act and to what they might attend in situations I

19:46.360 --> 19:48.720
haven't seen because now I know their aim.

19:48.720 --> 19:49.720
What's he up to?

19:49.720 --> 19:52.280
That's what you're thinking in a murder mystery or in a thriller.

19:52.280 --> 19:53.280
What's he up to?

19:53.280 --> 19:54.280
What's he up to?

19:54.280 --> 19:55.560
What's going to happen next?

19:55.560 --> 20:01.840
And so the plot of the fiction is the aim of the character across time.

20:01.840 --> 20:06.360
The aim as the character unfolds and that might involve the transformation of his aims

20:06.360 --> 20:07.360
as well.

20:07.360 --> 20:08.360
Right?

20:08.360 --> 20:10.800
And that would be the transformation of a character in a movie.

20:10.800 --> 20:16.120
He aims at one thing and he learns that that aim is off in some manner or he comes to a

20:16.120 --> 20:22.240
bitter and dismal partial end and has to switch course and you want to see people transform

20:22.400 --> 20:23.400
their aims.

20:23.400 --> 20:28.160
That's character development.

20:28.160 --> 20:33.800
We see the world through a story.

20:33.800 --> 20:37.880
The world's objects reveal themselves in relationship to our aim.

20:37.880 --> 20:46.680
The landscape of emotion presents itself as markers on the pathway to our aim.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.400
The world reveals itself in accordance with our aim.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.200
That's how perception works.

20:51.200 --> 20:56.080
That's a hell of a thing to learn because if the world, for example, appears to you

20:56.080 --> 21:00.520
only as thorn-bearing obstacles, right?

21:00.520 --> 21:04.240
If you feel that everything's arrayed against you and there's no pathway forward, if you

21:04.240 --> 21:11.840
feel that you're surrounded by foes and obstacles instead of walking the golden pathway accompanied

21:11.840 --> 21:19.000
by allies with the world on your side, you might ask yourself whether or not your aim

21:19.040 --> 21:21.920
is wrong.

21:21.920 --> 21:27.960
And so the world lays itself out in accordance with our aim.

21:27.960 --> 21:32.200
We produce fiction.

21:32.200 --> 21:35.400
We generate fiction.

21:35.400 --> 21:40.920
We live in a fictional landscape because we want to get our aim right.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.600
We read stories.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.040
We watch movies.

21:44.040 --> 21:45.240
We go to plays.

21:45.240 --> 21:48.560
We talk to each other because we want to get our aim right.

21:48.560 --> 21:53.520
We want to find the place we should go and we want to learn how to get there efficiently.

21:53.520 --> 22:02.800
And we're compelled by spirit and instinct to establish the aim and follow the path and

22:02.800 --> 22:11.360
to transform ourselves so that our aim becomes ever more precise and efficient and delivers

22:11.360 --> 22:16.600
us a world that's ever more abundant and beautiful.

22:16.640 --> 22:19.760
And that's all a function of aim.

22:19.760 --> 22:23.080
Big tech companies enrich themselves by taking your personal data.

22:23.080 --> 22:27.480
They grab your web history, email metadata, and video searches to create a detailed profile

22:27.480 --> 22:30.800
on you and then they sell that off to the highest bidder.

22:30.800 --> 22:34.080
Companies aren't just selling products anymore, they're selling you.

22:34.080 --> 22:39.040
To protect your identity and data from these tech giants, I recommend using ExpressVPN every

22:39.040 --> 22:40.600
time you go online.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.640
Think about all the websites you visit.

22:42.640 --> 22:46.720
Everything you do and say online is tracked using your public IP address which allows

22:46.720 --> 22:50.520
them to uniquely match your activity and know your location.

22:50.520 --> 22:55.520
ExpressVPN makes you anonymous online by camouflaging your IP address and replacing it with a different

22:55.520 --> 22:57.880
secure IP of your choice.

22:57.880 --> 23:01.800
ExpressVPN also encrypts all of your data to protect it from hackers and anyone else

23:01.800 --> 23:03.560
who might try to spy on you.

23:03.560 --> 23:07.600
What I like most about ExpressVPN though is how easy it is to use.

23:07.600 --> 23:12.080
Just download the app on your phone or computer, tap one button, and you're protected.

23:12.080 --> 23:16.720
So if you're like me and you believe your internet data belongs to you, then ExpressVPN

23:16.720 --> 23:18.280
is the answer.

23:18.280 --> 23:25.880
Protect your online data today by visiting expressvpn.com slash jordan, e-x-p-r-e-s-s-vpn.com

23:25.880 --> 23:29.280
slash jordan, and you can get an extra three months free.

23:29.280 --> 23:32.200
That's expressvpn.com slash jordan.

23:32.200 --> 23:37.760
Okay, so we live in a story.

23:37.760 --> 23:41.600
Well then, as soon as you know that, this is what the postmodernists figured out.

23:42.120 --> 23:47.880
By the way, this is why the literary critics have become a dominant force in the Cultural

23:47.880 --> 23:49.400
War.

23:49.400 --> 23:52.480
Postmodernists were literary critics who think, well, there's nothing more irrelevant than

23:52.480 --> 23:53.480
the literary critic.

23:53.480 --> 23:56.840
Like, who the hell cares what an intellectual thinks about a story?

23:56.840 --> 24:02.420
I mean, of all the preposterous things to be concerned about, that might top the list.

24:02.420 --> 24:05.460
Not if the story is the thing through which you see the world.

24:05.460 --> 24:09.880
If the story is the thing you see through which you see the world, there's nothing more powerful

24:09.880 --> 24:14.040
than a literary critic, except perhaps an author.

24:14.040 --> 24:20.840
And we wouldn't have a culture war right now if the literary critic wasn't far more powerful

24:20.840 --> 24:25.840
than anybody had possibly imagined, because the French intellectual literary critics known

24:25.840 --> 24:34.280
as the postmodernists have criticized the central story of the West to death.

24:34.280 --> 24:36.200
And that's why we have a culture war.

24:36.200 --> 24:37.800
And it's no joke.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.280
This is foundational.

24:39.320 --> 24:42.280
There's no more serious conflict than that.

24:42.280 --> 24:43.400
And you all can feel that.

24:43.400 --> 24:44.400
That's why you're here.

24:44.400 --> 24:49.900
You know that the world is shaking and uncertain in a way that's new.

24:49.900 --> 24:53.840
And the reason for that is the story itself is under assault.

24:53.840 --> 24:58.760
All right, so let's wander through that a little bit.

24:58.760 --> 25:02.040
You see the world through a story.

25:02.040 --> 25:04.560
The rationalists are empiricists, even the biologists.

25:04.560 --> 25:07.400
They might have an answer to that to say, okay, fair enough, you see the world through

25:07.400 --> 25:08.400
a story.

25:08.400 --> 25:14.160
But the story is biologically determined or socioculturally determined.

25:14.160 --> 25:16.080
It's a story of sex.

25:16.080 --> 25:20.040
That would be Freud, because for Freud and for Charles Darwin for that matter, for Richard

25:20.040 --> 25:33.600
Dawkins, the famous atheist to an equal degree, the story, the aim is sex, reproduction, and

25:33.600 --> 25:45.520
the story is predicated on that aim, Freud, Darwin, Dawkins.

25:45.520 --> 25:50.380
The degenerate element of that is a descent into a kind of hedonism.

25:50.380 --> 25:58.080
Because if sex is the story, then why not worship sex?

25:58.080 --> 26:03.880
And some dispute that and say, no, the central story isn't sex.

26:03.880 --> 26:05.640
This would be the Marxists.

26:05.640 --> 26:12.440
The central story is power.

26:12.440 --> 26:18.400
That's the story that the universities tell when they're not telling the story about sex.

26:18.400 --> 26:21.400
It's all about power.

26:21.400 --> 26:31.240
The essential human aim is domination, oppression, victimization, exploitation.

26:31.240 --> 26:36.680
The central theme of the family is a power dynamic.

26:36.680 --> 26:41.860
The central theme of the relationship between men and women is a power dynamic.

26:41.860 --> 26:49.160
Marriage itself is a heteronormative patriarchal establishment of oppression that goes back

26:49.160 --> 26:50.880
to the dawn of time.

26:50.880 --> 26:54.840
The nuclear family is the same thing.

26:54.840 --> 26:57.160
Economic arrangements are nothing but power.

26:57.160 --> 26:58.440
Friendships are nothing but power.

26:58.440 --> 27:08.360
The landscape of human interaction is a dynamic of power, or sex, or both, or both fighting

27:08.360 --> 27:10.320
against one another.

27:10.320 --> 27:13.600
Look, these are powerful ideas.

27:13.600 --> 27:14.600
Why?

27:14.600 --> 27:15.600
Well, obvious.

27:15.600 --> 27:16.600
It's obvious.

27:16.600 --> 27:17.600
Why?

27:17.600 --> 27:25.760
Well, without sex, there's no reproduction, and without reproduction, there's no people.

27:25.760 --> 27:32.800
And so the Darwinian, Freudian, Richard Dawkins' selfish gene claim is that, well, what could

27:32.800 --> 27:37.080
it possibly be other than sex?

27:37.080 --> 27:43.480
And the Marxists come running forward and say, hello, power.

27:43.480 --> 27:49.640
And then the Marxists say, well, obviously it's power, because there's radical inequality

27:49.640 --> 27:50.640
in the world.

27:50.640 --> 27:53.640
There's some who have and some who have not.

27:53.640 --> 27:57.720
There's no reason to assume that property in the final analysis, let's say, isn't a

27:57.720 --> 27:59.520
form of theft.

27:59.520 --> 28:05.720
And everyone who has established themselves in some manner has only done that by stealing

28:05.720 --> 28:09.640
from those who are powerless and who have less, everything they have, and accruing it

28:09.640 --> 28:10.640
to themselves.

28:10.920 --> 28:14.080
That's a credible claim for a variety of reasons.

28:14.080 --> 28:19.240
The first, most fundamental reason is that a minority of people have all the success

28:19.240 --> 28:22.720
on any possible dimension of comparison.

28:22.720 --> 28:25.400
It's a very small number of people who are radically attractive.

28:25.400 --> 28:29.760
It's a very small number of people who are radically gifted in the visual arts, let's

28:29.760 --> 28:30.760
say.

28:30.760 --> 28:33.640
It's a radically small percentage of people who are musicians.

28:33.640 --> 28:36.800
A tiny percentage of the people have most of the money.

28:36.800 --> 28:42.000
A tiny percentage of the people gather most of the attention.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.040
It's a pre-do distribution, and that's what Marx pointed on to.

28:45.040 --> 28:47.560
The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.

28:47.560 --> 28:55.800
And there's real truth in that, and there's truth in the claim that people structure their

28:55.800 --> 29:01.760
relationships with power, and that some people who obtain success do it as a consequence

29:01.760 --> 29:03.200
of exploitation.

29:03.200 --> 29:10.320
And it's equally true that when any human relationship deteriorates, it tends to deteriorate

29:10.320 --> 29:12.360
in the relationship of power.

29:12.360 --> 29:17.640
If your marriage starts to become shaky, then you begin to exploit each other.

29:17.640 --> 29:19.280
Use force.

29:19.280 --> 29:20.360
You try to get your way.

29:20.360 --> 29:22.080
You try to dominate.

29:22.080 --> 29:26.200
It's the same within any family that's deteriorating into a state of pathology.

29:26.200 --> 29:28.240
It's the same in any organization.

29:28.240 --> 29:32.920
We've seen huge states deteriorate into the tyrannical use of power.

29:32.920 --> 29:47.080
If you had to identify a cardinal attribute of mankind, power is a reasonable hypothesis.

29:47.080 --> 29:49.120
But let's think about that for a minute.

29:49.120 --> 29:59.480
So imagine that, well, imagine that it's sex that is and should be the complete story

29:59.480 --> 30:00.480
of mankind.

30:00.480 --> 30:01.960
Well, what does that mean exactly?

30:02.000 --> 30:05.520
What's a world organized on that basis?

30:05.520 --> 30:08.080
What does a world organized on that basis look like?

30:08.080 --> 30:10.880
Well, there's nothing more important than sex.

30:10.880 --> 30:15.080
Well, how about immediate sexual gratification whenever you want it?

30:15.080 --> 30:20.320
How about immediate sexual gratification as the archetype of hedonism?

30:20.320 --> 30:24.560
How about immediate sexual gratification whenever you want it, regardless of what anyone else

30:24.560 --> 30:26.720
has to say about it?

30:26.720 --> 30:33.840
Because if it's the story and it's the fundamental story, then what stops me from gaining access

30:33.840 --> 30:40.280
to what I want right now, regardless of the cost to anyone else?

30:40.280 --> 30:44.880
If there's nothing beyond that, if only the naive believe that there's anything noble

30:44.880 --> 30:49.520
about humanity beyond the immediate demand of reproduction, then what have you got to

30:49.520 --> 30:54.280
say that's moral about sex and why the hell shouldn't everybody just do exactly what they

30:54.280 --> 31:03.080
want with whoever they want whenever they want all the time?

31:03.080 --> 31:06.040
And with power, you can make exactly the same argument.

31:06.040 --> 31:12.600
And classical societies, aristocratic societies, militaristic and martial societies are predicated

31:12.600 --> 31:13.840
on this idea.

31:13.840 --> 31:21.200
If I can push you around, all that indicates is that I should push you around because if

31:21.200 --> 31:27.720
you're so weak that I can push you around, you have absolutely no ground whatsoever to

31:27.720 --> 31:30.720
stand on to oppose me.

31:30.720 --> 31:36.820
Because if you were moral by the traditions of power, I wouldn't be able to push you around.

31:36.820 --> 31:41.120
And so it's very difficult to argue out of that from a rational perspective.

31:41.120 --> 31:43.160
Why doesn't it make right?

31:43.160 --> 31:47.120
And why isn't it only the weak who claim that that's wrong?

31:47.120 --> 31:50.760
And why isn't it only that the weak claim that that's wrong?

31:50.760 --> 31:53.200
Not because they're moral, but because they're weak.

31:53.200 --> 31:59.040
That would certainly be a spin-off on the Nietzschean notion that will to power constitutes

31:59.040 --> 32:00.960
the core of man.

32:00.960 --> 32:09.680
And I would say up until the dawn of Judeo-Christian ethic, let's say, power ruled.

32:09.680 --> 32:12.840
And then we could imagine what sort of world it's like when power rules.

32:12.840 --> 32:14.360
Well, we know what that world's like.

32:14.360 --> 32:19.960
It's like pay attention to the strongest or suffer the consequences.

32:19.960 --> 32:30.160
Well, is there something beyond that that's not mere naivety?

32:30.160 --> 32:37.520
What's if it isn't power that's the story, and if it isn't sex that's the story.

32:37.520 --> 32:40.840
What's the story?

32:40.840 --> 32:48.440
For the West, the answer to that is the library of the Bible.

32:48.440 --> 32:49.880
That's the story.

32:49.880 --> 32:54.840
It's the story upon which the West is founded.

32:54.840 --> 33:00.960
It's the story that has arisen over thousands of years, tens of thousands of years, for

33:00.960 --> 33:10.800
that matter, attempting to address the core issue.

33:10.880 --> 33:13.320
What's the fundamental story?

33:13.320 --> 33:19.960
It's no mystery to make the claim that the claim of the biblical library of stories,

33:19.960 --> 33:25.320
because it is a library, is that it's the fundamental story.

33:25.320 --> 33:31.880
All right, so we live in a story.

33:31.880 --> 33:36.320
We've identified the competitors, power and sex.

33:36.320 --> 33:38.840
What is it that's being expressed in the biblical story?

33:38.880 --> 33:44.280
Look, if you go to a movie, you read a complex book, you go to a sophisticated movie, a

33:44.280 --> 33:50.320
sophisticated play, a Shakespearean play, or you read a sophisticated work of fiction,

33:50.320 --> 33:54.680
you see a multi-dimensional characterization, right?

33:54.680 --> 33:59.240
A comic book has a hero with one motive.

33:59.240 --> 34:06.880
A sophisticated work of fiction has a hero, and perhaps an anti-hero, with complex multi-dimensional

34:06.880 --> 34:08.520
motivations.

34:08.520 --> 34:17.040
Whatever characterizes those more realistic people isn't reducible to any single attribute.

34:17.040 --> 34:23.440
And in a complicated work of fiction, the author walks you through a multi-dimensional

34:23.440 --> 34:24.680
characterization.

34:24.680 --> 34:30.920
You see the same person, the hero aiming upward, the anti-hero or villain aiming downward.

34:30.920 --> 34:35.800
You see that person portrayed in multiple different situations.

34:35.800 --> 34:43.520
And pursuing partial reflections of their ultimate aim.

34:43.520 --> 34:54.800
And in consequence of that, you learn to understand and embody that complex of aims.

34:54.800 --> 34:59.760
When you see a movie and you watch the hero, you're watching the hero to learn how to act

34:59.760 --> 35:01.840
like a hero.

35:01.840 --> 35:06.560
When you're watching a movie and you watch the anti-hero or the villain, you're watching

35:06.560 --> 35:13.080
the movie to learn how not to fail catastrophically and land in hell while taking everyone else

35:13.080 --> 35:15.880
along with you.

35:15.880 --> 35:23.820
Is it reducible to something as simple as power or sex?

35:23.820 --> 35:26.040
Not if it's not a comic book.

35:26.040 --> 35:28.360
You need a multi-dimensional characterization.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.800
All right.

35:30.800 --> 35:37.920
The biblical corpus provides a multi-dimensional characterization of the fundamental aim of

35:37.920 --> 35:40.720
man and cosmos.

35:40.720 --> 35:42.120
That's the claim of the book.

35:42.120 --> 35:49.120
So I'm going to walk you through some of the stories and show you what's being revealed.

35:49.120 --> 35:52.120
What's being revealed is the proper object of worship.

35:52.120 --> 35:53.120
Okay.

35:53.120 --> 35:54.120
So what does that mean?

35:54.120 --> 35:55.800
The proper object of celebration.

35:55.800 --> 36:01.640
The aim towards which all sacrifices and work are to be directed.

36:01.640 --> 36:04.640
That which should be held in the highest regard.

36:04.640 --> 36:09.640
That which should be imitated in ritual and admiration.

36:09.640 --> 36:10.640
Okay.

36:10.640 --> 36:15.320
So that's the idea.

36:15.320 --> 36:25.680
Admiration in the same way that a small child who hero worships the boy down the street who's

36:25.760 --> 36:35.720
the baseball star because that boy portrays a pattern of skill and attention that is the

36:35.720 --> 36:40.720
next appropriate developmental step for the hero worshiping child.

36:40.720 --> 36:44.800
That's a recreation of the religious impulse.

36:44.800 --> 36:47.760
The impulse to look up, admire, and imitate.

36:47.760 --> 36:52.720
The question being to what should we address our attention upward looking, admire, and

36:52.720 --> 36:57.160
imitate.

36:57.160 --> 37:08.640
That highest possible object of apprehension and admiration is by definition God.

37:08.640 --> 37:11.400
It's a definition.

37:11.400 --> 37:16.360
It's the highest aim that lurks behind all proximal aims.

37:16.360 --> 37:17.920
That's a good way of thinking about it.

37:17.920 --> 37:19.960
It's the upward aim as such.

37:19.960 --> 37:21.520
All right.

37:21.520 --> 37:23.120
How do you bring that down to earth?

37:23.120 --> 37:25.760
Well, let's start with Genesis one.

37:25.760 --> 37:33.080
There's a characterization of God and man in Genesis one.

37:33.080 --> 37:37.400
The story opens at the dawn of time, at the beginning of things.

37:37.400 --> 37:40.000
That's not exactly the beginning of time.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.960
That's usually how it's read, but it's more complex than that.

37:42.960 --> 37:48.440
It's not only the beginning of time in the linear sense, but it's the beginning of all

37:48.440 --> 37:50.160
things that begin.

37:50.160 --> 37:52.920
This is what happens every time something begins.

37:52.920 --> 37:57.800
This is what happens every time something new makes its entry into the world.

37:57.800 --> 38:04.120
It's the continual beginning that continually unfolds, that happened and is happening now

38:04.120 --> 38:07.240
and will always happen.

38:07.240 --> 38:19.200
It's the pattern of the emergence of order out of chaos that makes itself manifest in

38:19.200 --> 38:23.080
the form of your life.

38:23.080 --> 38:24.880
How is the stage set?

38:24.880 --> 38:33.600
The Spirit of God hovers over the water, over the deep.

38:33.600 --> 38:44.200
You hear that in the Judeo-Christian tradition, God engenders the world ex nihilo out of nothing.

38:44.200 --> 38:46.760
That's not how the story sets itself up.

38:46.760 --> 38:53.160
It sets itself up with the Spirit of God hovering above the waters, but it's not water.

38:53.160 --> 38:54.360
That's not the word.

38:54.360 --> 39:04.880
Water is one of the symbolic images attempting to make what's being described clear using

39:04.880 --> 39:07.240
a sequence of complex metaphors.

39:07.240 --> 39:14.280
The word for the water over which the Spirit of God hovers is tohu-vabohu, or tehom, and

39:14.320 --> 39:16.920
it means a lot of things.

39:16.920 --> 39:24.440
It means the dragon that lives at the bottom of the deepest well.

39:24.440 --> 39:31.000
It means the unplumbable depths of the most abysmal ocean.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.240
It means the water that brings forth life.

39:34.240 --> 39:42.040
It means the infinite well of possibility itself.

39:42.040 --> 39:48.680
It means the confusion that rains when your world falls apart.

39:48.680 --> 39:59.800
It means the unstructured day that makes itself manifest when you wake up.

39:59.800 --> 40:01.240
It means all of that.

40:01.240 --> 40:08.920
It means the dragon that the archaic God sliced into pieces and made the world from.

40:08.920 --> 40:16.200
It means it's the hydra that Hercules defeats to form the world.

40:16.200 --> 40:18.360
It's all of that.

40:18.360 --> 40:21.200
So what does that mean?

40:21.200 --> 40:28.760
It means that the Spirit of Being and Becoming generates the world from possibility.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.240
What does that mean?

40:30.240 --> 40:32.760
That's what your consciousness does.

40:32.760 --> 40:33.760
That's what you do.

40:33.760 --> 40:38.240
See, you think you're surrounded by a world of objects that you manipulate in a robotic

40:38.240 --> 40:44.040
fashion, but you're not concerned with the objects that are static.

40:44.040 --> 40:49.360
You're concerned with what you can dynamically transform when you wake up in the morning.

40:49.360 --> 40:56.920
What presents itself to you is a field of indeterminate opportunity.

40:56.920 --> 41:02.800
That's why you're worried or perhaps excited because you have something to grapple with

41:02.800 --> 41:05.880
that hasn't yet come into being.

41:05.880 --> 41:09.960
The possibilities of the day, and you might think, oh my God, I have so many things to

41:09.960 --> 41:10.960
do.

41:10.960 --> 41:11.960
I'm overwhelmed.

41:11.960 --> 41:12.960
It's too much.

41:12.960 --> 41:14.880
Well, that's the Tohu Vabohu.

41:14.880 --> 41:17.000
That's the chaos and confusion.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.280
That's a plethora of possibility.

41:19.280 --> 41:23.800
You're thinking, oh my God, how many ways are there for things to go wrong?

41:23.800 --> 41:29.560
Well, that's the multi-headed serpent that the hero always confronts.

41:29.560 --> 41:31.080
And what do you have to do with that?

41:31.080 --> 41:34.080
It's like, well, are you going to establish the order that you have to do with that?

41:34.080 --> 41:38.760
Are you going to establish the order that's good in the course of the day?

41:38.760 --> 41:40.840
Because that's what you're called upon to do.

41:40.840 --> 41:48.040
And it's your recreation of what God himself does at the beginning of time that constitutes

41:48.040 --> 41:53.560
the action of your conscious on the possibility that's in front of you.

41:53.560 --> 42:02.680
You have a microcosm of plenitude and possibility right in front of you at any moment that you

42:02.680 --> 42:08.480
can wrestle into order if your aim is right.

42:08.480 --> 42:19.400
The process that God relies on to extract the cosmos, the order that's good, from the

42:19.400 --> 42:24.720
well of unformed possibility is the word.

42:24.720 --> 42:26.240
It's the logos.

42:26.240 --> 42:32.120
What does that mean?

42:32.120 --> 42:37.000
How much hell can you bring into being by saying the wrong words to your wife?

42:37.000 --> 42:43.560
Right, now your wife is who she is, but she's also who she could become as you've no doubt

42:43.560 --> 42:45.520
noticed many times.

42:45.520 --> 42:53.120
And you can extract out something good or something terrible from the possibility she

42:53.120 --> 43:01.680
represents with the cautious and loving application of your words or with the careful and prideful

43:01.680 --> 43:04.240
and dismissive application of your words.

43:04.240 --> 43:10.680
And the world you live in will be radically different depending on which of those two

43:10.680 --> 43:12.360
approaches you apply.

43:12.360 --> 43:17.560
And that will be exactly the same with anyone else you talk to and how you treat yourself

43:17.560 --> 43:21.000
and how you interact with the world as such.

43:21.000 --> 43:31.680
Because there's a provision of possibility that you're offered as a participant in the

43:31.680 --> 43:37.520
process of creation that you formulate in accordance with your aim.

43:37.520 --> 43:42.000
What's the insistence in Genesis 1?

43:42.000 --> 43:45.120
Aim up with love.

43:45.120 --> 43:51.680
So if you want to establish the paradise of your household in relationship to your wife

43:51.680 --> 43:59.460
and your children, you aim at what's best for the best in them.

43:59.460 --> 44:03.520
You offer them the security that you can imagine.

44:03.520 --> 44:06.120
That's the walls of the walled garden.

44:06.120 --> 44:17.220
And you present to them the challenge that allows them to unfold and develop optimally.

44:17.220 --> 44:23.600
And you do that appropriately if you're aiming at what's best, what's highest.

44:23.600 --> 44:31.400
And that's the spirit of God that makes itself manifest on the waters of possibility.

44:31.400 --> 44:41.040
That's the embodiment, the source, the initial source, and the spirit of upward-aiming ultimate

44:41.040 --> 44:44.600
love.

44:44.600 --> 44:51.440
You can understand this by understanding what sort of walled garden you produce in your

44:51.440 --> 44:56.840
own household with your aim.

44:56.840 --> 45:08.040
God wrestles with the possibility that's not yet manifest and creates the cosmic order

45:08.040 --> 45:12.440
as a consequence, in sequence.

45:12.440 --> 45:14.880
Creating the fundamental divisions to begin with.

45:14.880 --> 45:17.600
The separation of light and darkness.

45:17.600 --> 45:19.560
That's the phenomenology of day and night.

45:19.560 --> 45:22.000
The separation of the land from the waters.

45:22.000 --> 45:29.880
The establishment of the dome of the sky over the disk of the earth populates the world

45:29.880 --> 45:45.560
with its created beings and on the sixth day produces man and says in his own image.

45:45.560 --> 45:52.120
So now we have a characterization of God who's the dynamic process that gives rise to

45:52.120 --> 45:59.920
order from possibility itself in keeping with the highest possible aim.

45:59.920 --> 46:06.280
And we have a characterization of the human being as a microcosm of that process.

46:06.280 --> 46:17.200
The notion that each of us has a worth that's transcendental and not given by the state,

46:17.200 --> 46:25.240
not given by yourself, not given by other individuals is predicated on that image.

46:25.240 --> 46:28.480
I mean that historically and I mean it conceptually.

46:28.480 --> 46:37.560
The notion is that, one of the notions is that the state itself has to grant to you

46:37.560 --> 46:47.040
the worth of someone created in the image of the creator himself in order even for the

46:47.040 --> 46:52.440
state to exist, maintain itself and transform.

46:52.440 --> 47:00.700
That the state itself cannot function unless it establishes a sacred boundary between its

47:00.700 --> 47:07.560
operations and the operation of the psyche, the human psyche, the human spirit that's

47:07.560 --> 47:13.560
a manifestation of the God who generates the order that's good from possibility.

47:13.560 --> 47:17.600
As your business grows, the workload can become overwhelming tasks that used to take a day

47:17.600 --> 47:18.600
now take a week.

47:18.760 --> 47:21.800

48:13.000 --> 48:17.040
And you might ask, well, who believes that?

48:17.040 --> 48:25.640
And I would say, try talking to one person once without believing that and see how it

48:25.640 --> 48:27.240
goes.

48:27.240 --> 48:32.300
We call to each other all the time, especially in our intimate relationships, to be treated

48:32.300 --> 48:38.240
as if we are the locus of value.

48:38.240 --> 48:42.840
And if you treat people that way, if you regard them that way, if you perceive them

48:42.840 --> 48:54.080
that way, if you encourage them in that pathway of development, everything in your interactions

48:54.080 --> 49:00.720
with human beings will open itself up to you and fill your life with abundance.

49:00.720 --> 49:03.040
Everyone wants to be treated that way.

49:03.040 --> 49:08.880
And the reason for that is, it's in keeping with our essential nature.

49:08.880 --> 49:22.360
And that that hospitable, welcoming, encouraging, upward-aiming, loving treatment is the aim

49:22.360 --> 49:34.600
and attitude upon which the soul, the community, and the natural order itself depends for its

49:34.600 --> 49:36.640
integrity.

49:36.640 --> 49:40.180
Your country is predicated on that notion.

49:40.180 --> 49:48.760
The idea that each of you is endowed with inalienable rights and their requisite responsibilities

49:48.760 --> 49:52.560
is a direct reflection of that conceptualization.

49:52.560 --> 50:00.360
And one of the things you might frequently remind yourself of is the fact that your country

50:00.360 --> 50:07.040
wouldn't be what it is, which is the closest approximation to a shining city on the hill

50:07.040 --> 50:14.640
that's been established so far in the travail of mankind without that fundamental conception.

50:14.640 --> 50:17.760
Right?

50:17.760 --> 50:21.520
So then, you might say, well, is it true?

50:21.520 --> 50:26.400
And the answer is, it's not hell.

50:26.400 --> 50:31.000
I mean that because lots of countries are hell.

50:31.000 --> 50:36.960
And they're hell in a way that opens up into an abyss and has the possibility of a deeper

50:36.960 --> 50:43.240
abyss rating latent within it, which will open up with the possibility of a deeper abyss

50:43.240 --> 50:44.720
within that.

50:44.720 --> 50:52.040
And that's what happens when that fundamental characterization is overthrown in a revolutionary

50:52.040 --> 50:54.760
manner or carelessly abandoned.

50:54.760 --> 51:02.880
And we saw that for all of us who are non-believers and no longer conceptualize the metaphysical

51:02.880 --> 51:10.320
hell as real, we saw the metaphysical hell realized in the 20th century many times in

51:10.320 --> 51:19.880
case anyone having abandoned their metaphysical presuppositions was so blind that only an

51:19.880 --> 51:22.440
object lesson would suffice.

51:22.440 --> 51:23.760
Right?

51:23.760 --> 51:33.200
Only Germany, the Soviet Union under Stalin, the Chinese Communist Party under Mao, if

51:33.200 --> 51:40.520
that isn't close enough to hell for you, then I would say you should pray that you aren't

51:40.520 --> 51:51.080
introduced to something even worse for the purposes of convincing you about what's real.

51:51.080 --> 52:01.640
In the second, God announces two things, three things, four things once he creates man.

52:01.640 --> 52:07.400
He says, man is to tend the garden, that's his purpose.

52:07.400 --> 52:08.400
Why a garden?

52:08.400 --> 52:12.600
It's a walled garden actually because that's what paradise means, walled garden.

52:12.600 --> 52:13.600
Why a walled garden?

52:13.600 --> 52:19.760
Well, a garden is a place of nature, obviously, and walls are a place of culture, and a walled

52:19.760 --> 52:27.480
garden is a place of nature encapsulated in a manageable manner by the walls of culture.

52:27.480 --> 52:29.040
That's what your backyard is.

52:29.040 --> 52:35.200
It's a yard, it's nature, it has walls, the walls are culture, the walls you could think

52:35.200 --> 52:45.200
of as physical entities, as objects, but your lawn has borders if you don't have a fence

52:45.200 --> 52:47.920
and your neighbors know where the borders are and where are the borders?

52:48.280 --> 52:51.400
Well, they're in the imagination of your neighbors.

52:51.400 --> 52:53.920
I'm dead serious about that.

52:53.920 --> 52:57.360
The walls, it's so funny because you'll see people in the border between Canada and the

52:57.360 --> 53:01.840
United States, they'll get out and they'll step across the border.

53:01.840 --> 53:08.840
It's like, as if it's an object, as if it's an entity that's there on the ground, and

53:08.840 --> 53:17.520
people know that that's magic in some sense because the grass in Canada is only slightly

53:17.520 --> 53:24.760
less healthy than the grass in the United States, let's say.

53:24.760 --> 53:30.560
It's easy to concretize that, but the idea of a walled off space in a communal society

53:30.560 --> 53:33.320
is a social agreement.

53:33.320 --> 53:37.720
You have your domain, your house, your garden, your backyard.

53:37.720 --> 53:42.080
That's enough cosmos for you to set right, and perhaps if you're competent enough to

53:42.080 --> 53:48.440
do more, you'll expand your garden so that you have more to tend.

53:48.440 --> 53:57.000
But you start with a walled garden of some size, and if you tend it properly, then the

53:57.000 --> 54:05.560
promise is that as your competence grows, so will your dominion.

54:05.560 --> 54:10.400
Man sent to tend the garden, and to name everything that's in it.

54:10.400 --> 54:11.720
This is Adam.

54:12.160 --> 54:13.240
What does that mean?

54:13.240 --> 54:14.960
Well, it's the logos again.

54:14.960 --> 54:23.000
It's a re-representation of the creative spirit of God that makes itself manifest when time

54:23.000 --> 54:26.120
begins and when new things come into being.

54:26.120 --> 54:34.400
Our ability to name, our ability to speak, is that in the microcosmic manner.

54:34.400 --> 54:39.400
What we're capable of doing, that's what the patriarchal spirit does is name and order

54:39.400 --> 54:44.600
the world, and God brings everything to Adam to see what he'll name them.

54:44.600 --> 54:53.000
And that's a reflection of the idea that we have a created order, but man has a place

54:53.000 --> 54:58.760
in it, and the place is to organize it and to put everything in its proper place and

54:58.760 --> 55:02.240
to assign it its identity.

55:02.240 --> 55:09.200
And that's no different than the prioritization of attention that's part of the story.

55:09.200 --> 55:11.560
Name things in relationship to their function.

55:11.560 --> 55:23.400
Put things in place in relationship to their significance in the hierarchy of being.

55:23.400 --> 55:29.080
Orient them, orient all named things upward.

55:29.080 --> 55:34.200
Sequence, constrain, organize, and order.

55:34.200 --> 55:37.000
The manifestation of the patriarchal spirit.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.400
What does God decide?

55:38.400 --> 55:41.240
It's not good enough.

55:41.240 --> 55:43.240
Man lacks a helper.

55:43.240 --> 55:46.400
Man needs a helper.

55:46.400 --> 55:57.600
Woman's created as a consequence because the order that men produce because of their limitations

55:57.600 --> 56:07.280
is insufficient, and something has to be introduced to speak for that which is not included.

56:07.280 --> 56:09.480
That's the role of woman.

56:09.480 --> 56:11.800
That's the biblical role of the woman.

56:11.800 --> 56:14.200
It's the biological role of the mother.

56:14.200 --> 56:18.560
You know this in your own household.

56:18.560 --> 56:24.200
Women bring the concerns of the marginalized to the center.

56:24.200 --> 56:29.640
You can think about that politically, and it's useful to think about it politically.

56:29.640 --> 56:34.400
All established human orders exclude.

56:34.400 --> 56:36.920
The exclusion causes pain.

56:36.920 --> 56:41.400
The pain of exclusion requires a voice.

56:41.400 --> 56:46.160
That's the voice of the eternal mother.

56:46.160 --> 56:49.760
That's where Genesis 1 ends.

56:49.760 --> 56:53.720
Genesis 2 contains the story of Adam and Eve.

56:53.720 --> 56:56.240
It's another creation story.

56:56.240 --> 57:00.360
It's commensurate with the first one.

57:00.760 --> 57:05.560
It's a variation on a theme.

57:05.560 --> 57:13.560
God creates Adam out of matter, earth, and breath, spirit.

57:13.560 --> 57:14.560
Why?

57:14.560 --> 57:15.840
Because that's what human beings are.

57:15.840 --> 57:21.160
We're material creatures that are animated.

57:21.160 --> 57:23.480
Anima means spirit.

57:23.480 --> 57:26.720
We...

57:26.720 --> 57:29.600
What's the spirit?

57:29.600 --> 57:36.160
The spirit is the living organizing principle of the material.

57:36.160 --> 57:42.720
Human beings are an amalgam of the living organizing principle and the material.

57:42.720 --> 57:46.760
That's what's portrayed in the creation of Adam.

57:46.760 --> 57:48.760
The combination of matter and spirit.

57:48.760 --> 57:52.200
The combination of material and conscious.

57:52.200 --> 57:55.920
You could think about it that way if you're more secular minded.

57:55.920 --> 57:59.560
We're conscious matter.

57:59.560 --> 58:01.680
What's up with that?

58:01.680 --> 58:03.200
No one understands that.

58:03.200 --> 58:05.320
No materialist understands that.

58:05.320 --> 58:08.200
We understand nothing about consciousness.

58:08.200 --> 58:12.680
It's as mysterious now as it's been throughout the entire course of our existence.

58:12.680 --> 58:16.240
It's never been reduced to material phenomenon.

58:16.240 --> 58:18.440
We have no idea what that would even mean.

58:18.440 --> 58:22.440
And if we did reduce it to the material, all that would mean was that we inadvertently

58:22.440 --> 58:25.120
elevated the material.

58:25.120 --> 58:27.480
We treat our each other like we're conscious.

58:27.480 --> 58:31.320
We presume from first principles that we're conscious.

58:31.320 --> 58:36.280
We can't even distinguish between being itself and being conscious.

58:36.280 --> 58:45.000
And so that's a perfectly reasonable representation of man.

58:45.000 --> 58:51.960
Woman is taken from man, from a rib, from the side as an equal.

58:51.960 --> 59:00.440
There's a critique of patriarchal Judeo-Christian narrative from the resentful feminist side

59:00.440 --> 59:05.320
that makes the claim that the biblical narrative is, for example, radically patriarchal in

59:05.320 --> 59:10.520
its orientation, dooming women to subjugation.

59:10.520 --> 59:13.920
That's a preposterous claim, by the way.

59:13.920 --> 59:16.200
It's not only false.

59:16.200 --> 59:18.080
It's false in a very particular way.

59:18.080 --> 59:22.400
There are falsehoods that are approximations of the truth.

59:22.400 --> 59:27.080
There are falsehoods so deep that they're the exact opposite of the truth.

59:27.080 --> 59:33.760
And the truth of the matter is that right from the first words, the biblical library

59:33.760 --> 59:40.600
is miraculous in its insistence that women like men are made in the image of God.

59:40.600 --> 59:42.520
That emerges in the first chapter.

59:42.520 --> 59:53.640
In that Eve is the equal of Adam in every manner, although complementary and not identical.

59:53.640 --> 01:00:02.680
And our society is riven by conflict so deep that we now doubt both of those propositions.

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:08.520
There's no form of confusion more profound than that.

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:12.400
Sexually reproducing creatures without nervous systems can tell the difference between male

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.400
and female.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:21.520
I'm dead serious about that.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:25.800
If you can get people to swallow the lie that there's no difference between men and women,

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:31.080
there is no lie they won't swallow.

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:34.200
Right?

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:44.440
God makes Adam and Eve, each with their own role, and he puts them in the garden to play

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:49.200
forever under the watchful eye of their heavenly Father.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:53.880
And he tells them they have free reign in the garden with everything delightful that's

01:00:53.880 --> 01:01:00.520
being created, that's being created, except for one thing, they're not to eat the fruit

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:08.640
of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.040
So what does that mean?

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:13.720
Man, that's a mystery.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:21.200
I spent a long time trying to crack the micro-narratives in the story of Adam and Eve, and it wasn't

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:29.120
until three or four years ago that I think I started to understand that particular fragment

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:31.120
of the story.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:35.920
A friend of mine is here, Jonathan Pazzo, some of you might have been following him.

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:43.800
Jonathan and his brother Matthew really helped me crack this, and so we're here, I'm here

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:48.680
with Jonathan and a number of my other colleagues and friends right now with the Daily Wire recording

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:50.600
another seminar.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:55.560
We released an Exodus seminar, we're recording a seminar in the Gospels right now, we're

01:01:55.560 --> 01:02:04.040
about 60% of the way through that, and so just so you know, that's also forthcoming.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:10.760
God tells human beings, he makes one fundamental rule, do not eat of the fruit of the tree

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.040
of the knowledge of good and evil.

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:15.160
Okay, that's moral knowledge.

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:20.560
That should be self-evident, knowledge of good and evil, that's moral knowledge.

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:23.840
Moral knowledge is predicated on the idea that there's an upward path and a downward

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:27.360
path, that there are desirable things and that there are undesirable things, and that

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:32.320
the pinnacle of what's desirable is what's heavenly or paradisal, and in the abysmal

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:36.680
depths of what's undesirable is the diabolical and the hellish.

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:39.680
And that's the moral landscape, that's the landscape of good and evil.

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:47.360
That's the fictional landscape, fictional in the sense of characterization and plot, fictional

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:51.880
in the sense of distilled truth, not falsehood.

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:58.360
Fictional in the sense that the fiction describes the structure through which you see the world.

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:02.280
Fiction as the deepest form of truth.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:08.360
What does it mean to eat of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil?

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:15.600
When Nietzsche announced the death of God in the late 1800s, he said something that

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.880
he believed would constitute a pathway forward.

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:25.920
He said, we have dispensed with God, we are the greatest murderers who ever lived.

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:33.920
We've engaged in a murder so profound that we'll never wash away the blood.

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:42.240
How could we possibly conduct ourselves in the aftermath of that murder?

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:46.520
You read of Nietzsche as a triumphant anti-Christian.

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:54.280
He was a very complicated person and he knew perfectly well that the dissolution of the

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:57.800
Christian metaphysics would produce a cataclysmic consequence.

01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:05.880
He predicted in the late 1800s that Europe would turn to a radically resentful egalitarian

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:12.560
communitarianism that would kill tens of millions of people, which is exactly what happened.

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:17.680
And he saw that coming just as clearly as his Russian counterpart Theodor Dostoevsky

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.000
saw it.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.280
He knew what would rise in the aftermath of the death of God.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:29.520
He knew that resentment and communitarianism would be one temptation.

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:33.080
And he tried to formulate an alternative path.

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:36.680
He said, we're going to have to create our own values.

01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:43.320
We're going to have to take it upon ourselves to create the moral landscape.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:48.040
I read that and I understood why he said that.

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:53.960
I could see its influence on clinical psychology, for example, the notion of the self-actualized

01:04:53.960 --> 01:05:00.000
person, the notion that our soul should unfold in the direction that's commensurate with

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.960
the deepest understanding of our subjective selves, right?

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:08.400
The radical unveiling of subjectivity, self-definition.

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:15.960
I am what I say I am, which is a radical claim in our society now, a claim of omniscience.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:22.000
Not only am I who I say I am, you better act like I'm who I say I am.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.440
That's the claim of the radical subjective.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.880
Well, what's wrong with that claim?

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:30.800
Well, the psychoanalysts criticized Nietzsche very effectively.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:34.120
He said, look, how are you going to create your own values when you're not mastering

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.680
your own house?

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:38.600
Have you tried telling yourself what to do?

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:40.200
How does that work for you?

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:42.760
I know you're just your own obedient servant, right?

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:43.960
You're so morally pure.

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:48.360
You just tell yourself at New Year's that you're going to go to the gym and you're

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:53.960
going to diet and you're going to be some stellar, physique, lean, mean fighting machine

01:05:53.960 --> 01:06:00.280
by March and you go once and then you tell yourself lies about why you don't have to

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:02.200
go again, and that's the end of that.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:13.120
And if you were capable of creating your own values, you wouldn't be the banner, the

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:17.720
tattered banner that blows in the wind of its own whims.

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:20.240
The psychoanalysts figured this out very quickly.

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:25.760
You're a war of competing whims, and a creature like that's going to have a very difficult

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:34.120
time navigating the complex landscape of the ultimate moral pronouncement.

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:37.520
Who are you to make a decision about what constitutes good and evil?

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.960
And that's what God tells men and women.

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:44.280
It's like you don't get to create the moral order, you get to dwell within it.

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:47.560
You get to align yourself with the pre-existent moral order.

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:57.000
You do not take to yourself the right, the presumption to define good and evil themselves.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:06.760
You bow your head to good and you pray for deliverance from evil.

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:13.160
And if you violate that, look the hell out, and that's the pronouncement.

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:17.080
And so what happens?

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:22.440
The serpent offers Eve the fruit.

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.680
Why the serpent?

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:27.560
Well the serpent is camouflaged.

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:32.720
The serpent is crafty, subtle.

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:37.280
The serpent is marginalized.

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:39.200
The serpent is the voice of pride.

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:40.960
The serpent is Lucifer.

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:47.560
That's the metaphysical surrounding of the story that develops over centuries the notion

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:53.400
that the serpent in the Garden of Paradise is Lucifer himself, the spirit of pride.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.400
What does that mean?

01:07:54.400 --> 01:08:00.720
It's prideful presumption that makes you assume that you can define the moral order.

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:05.880
What's the prideful presumption of Eve at the beginning of time and forever?

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:09.680
I can even clasp the serpent to my breast.

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:20.120
It's the careless welcoming in of the monstrous and prideful under the guise of the pretension

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.960
of maternal compassion.

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:28.440
And if you can't see that happening in our society, you're blind.

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:32.400
It might be easy to just toss all of your discipline to the side for the summer, but

01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:35.480
a life of greatness doesn't happen by taking the easy route.

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:43.840
And what's the sin of Adam?

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:47.200
Well, what do men care about?

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:57.160
Women care about, properly about, the helpless infant.

01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:02.440
Men have powerful feminine virtue and it can be inverted and made prideful and trumpeted

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:09.920
and presumptuous to infantilize the world and to advertise that compassion as a badge

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:18.000
of worth and honor, as a mode of attaining status.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.080
What's Adam's sin?

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:21.640
What do men care about?

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:33.040
Taking women, men are ambitious fundamentally to impress women, for better or for worse.

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:42.280
What's the prideful pathway and false pathway to establishing a relationship with the two

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:45.720
demanding feminine?

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:48.560
I've got it.

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.360
Anything you want, dear.

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:51.560
Right.

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:53.000
And that's Adam's sin.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:01.080
He eve hearkens to the voice of the serpent and clutches it to her breast.

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:07.200
Despite the clear injunction from the divine, never to do that.

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:14.640
And Adam, weakly does exactly what the worst part of his wife wants.

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:20.640
And so here we are, folks.

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:23.000
So what's the consequence of that?

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:29.120
Well, the scales fall from the rise and they notice they're naked.

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:32.320
And they're deeply ashamed and they cover up.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:33.320
They become self-conscious.

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:38.480
Okay, so when do people become self-conscious?

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:41.400
When they make prideful errors.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:47.560
When you overreach and you reveal your inadequacy as a consequence of the mismatch between your

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:49.880
pride and your ability.

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:52.160
You'll be ashamed.

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:55.920
You'll recognize your insufficiency.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:00.720
You'll be aware of yourself as an isolated entity.

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:04.080
That's all to become self-conscious.

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:07.280
Psychologists have learned over the last 40 years that there's no difference between being

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.280
conscious of yourself and being miserable.

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:12.840
Those are literally the same thing.

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:21.840
If you're living a life of other-centered, communally-oriented, hospitable calling, you're

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:26.440
not attending to the miseries of your isolated self.

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:33.960
If you stay in your bailiwick and you don't put forward your hand presumptuously, you can

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:37.280
live in the absence of painful self-consciousness.

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:41.200
Pride goes before a fall.

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:46.520
We have a month devoted to pride in our culture, right?

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:47.600
Pride goes before a fall.

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:49.640
You know this in your own life.

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:55.880
You can ask yourself, and this has been a Christian conundrum since the beginning of time, is

01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:00.160
your life miserable because misery is baked into the structure of the world?

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:05.360
Or is your life miserable because you do stupid things and refuse to learn and bring endless

01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:08.160
misery on yourself in your presumption?

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:12.200
You know, you might say a little of column A and a little of column B, and fair enough,

01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:19.640
but you certainly know that the most painful episodes of your life come when you claim

01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:23.200
falsely to be more than you are.

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:34.040
And the core narrative in the Christian, Judeo-Christian ethos is that the fall of man into the profane

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:37.120
world is a consequence of pride.

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:39.760
And that is really something worth thinking about.

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:44.560
You know, Adam and Eve are called upon to work in misery as a consequence of their pride.

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:50.440
Well, could you work joyfully if you didn't overreach yourself, if you were aiming upward

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:54.480
properly, if you were telling the truth, if you were acting communally, if you were acting

01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:59.640
in relationship to what was highest, would it be possible that your work would be joyful

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:01.760
and bring abundance?

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:04.800
Isn't there times in your life when that's happened?

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:10.480
Is it the case that you move forward in misery in precise proportion to the pretension of

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:13.960
your aim?

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:18.160
It's worth considering.

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:23.680
It's the suspicion that arises at the end of the story that begins history because it's

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:33.440
with the prideful fall of Adam and Eve that history begins.

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:36.800
Adam and Eve discover they're naked and they hide.

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:41.080
And God comes along and says, Adam, where are you?

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:45.680
And Adam says, I'm over here, I'm hiding.

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:47.040
And God says, well, why are you hiding?

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:49.000
It's a foolish thing to do, right?

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.960
Because Adam is perfectly aware that God can see through bushes.

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:54.680
Adam is hiding from God.

01:14:54.680 --> 01:15:00.440
Is it your pathetic self-consciousness that makes you hide from God?

01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:01.600
That's a good question.

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:07.520
Are you not everything you could be because you're ashamed of who you are?

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:09.480
That's what that story indicates.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:12.960
And so God calls Adam on, he says, who told you?

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:13.960
Why are you hiding?

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:15.160
And Adam says, well, I'm naked.

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:20.240
And God says, well, how do you find out that you were naked?

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:23.520
How did you find out that you were inadequate?

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:27.320
How did you find out that you are shameful?

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:31.160
And Adam says, you know that woman you made me?

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.000
It's her fault.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.560
And that's the second sin of Adam.

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:38.880
And that's another indication of the non-patriarchal nature of the text.

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:43.760
You know, Eve is the first human being to take a bite of the apple, but Adam follows

01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:44.760
along.

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:49.600
And it isn't obvious to me that the follower of sin is in a worse, better moral position

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:51.200
than the initiator.

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:55.960
And then he compounds his sin, like men do, by blaming the woman.

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:56.960
Why is your life so...

01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:59.160
Well, if you had my wife, man, you'd know.

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:00.920
It's like those damn women.

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:06.280
It's like it's a handy excuse for men all the time to say that, and it's not least because

01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:11.280
men can't tolerate being rejected by women, and women reject them all the time.

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:15.320
And the reason women reject them is because they're not all they should be.

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:19.800
And so, of course, that makes men painfully self-conscious and makes them shake their fist

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:22.240
at God and makes them hide.

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:27.680
And so, well, God says, and so Adam reveals himself in this pathetic manner.

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:31.520
It's like he can't even take responsibility for his own misstep.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:37.680
He has to blame the thing that's been granted to him as the highest form of gift.

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:41.360
And not only her, but God.

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.360
Whose fault is it?

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:43.360
Well, it's not mine.

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:45.160
It's probably women's fault.

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:47.880
And if it's not women, it's clearly God.

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:51.320
It can't be me.

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:52.320
So what happens?

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:56.760
Well, both Adam and Eve are condemned to suffer in their work.

01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:59.440
And that's how history begins.

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:04.840
And that's the situation of the fallen world.

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:18.080
And that's the description of the landscape of profound fiction that we inhabit.

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:26.640
And that's only a tiny fraction of the characterization of God and man in the biblical corpus.

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:29.640
Thank you very much.
