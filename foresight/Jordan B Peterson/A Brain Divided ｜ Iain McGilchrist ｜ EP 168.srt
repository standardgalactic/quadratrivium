Hello. If you have found the ideas I discuss interesting and useful, perhaps you might

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:14,480
consider purchasing my recently released book, Beyond Order. 12 more rules for life, available

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,960
from Penguin Random House, in print, or audio format. You could use the links we provide

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:28,720
below or buy through Amazon or at your local bookstore. This new book, Beyond Order, provides

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,400
what I hope is a productive and interesting walk through ideas that are both philosophically and

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:41,440
sometimes spiritually meaningful, as well as being immediately implementable and practical.

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,080
Beyond Order can be read and understood on its own, but also builds on the concepts that I

8
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:54,720
developed in my previous books, 12 rules for life, and before that, maps of meaning.

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:09,440
Thanks for listening and enjoy the podcast.

10
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:29,040
I'm pleased today to be talking to Dr. Ian McGillchrist. I met him in 2018 in London, and

11
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,840
we had the good fortune to have a relatively brief conversation, which was taped and put on

12
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,840
YouTube, and it was very productive. And so now I get to talk to him again, and hopefully for a

13
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:49,120
longer period of time. Ian is a psychiatrist. Dr. McGillchrist is a psychologist, a psychiatrist,

14
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,480
a former fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, an associate fellow of Green Templeton College,

15
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,200
Oxford. He's lectured all over the world. He's published a number of scientific papers.

16
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,040
He's most well known for his book, The Master and His Emissary, and I think you have a copy of that.

17
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,720
I asked you to get that so that you could show people. The Master and His Emissary,

18
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,640
the divided brain in the making of the Western world, which is an analysis of hemispheric

19
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:24,880
specialization and its philosophical and scientific significance. And he's working on a new book,

20
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,000
which I have and have started to read a long ways into it at the moment, called The Matter of Things,

21
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,440
which will be forthcoming at some point in the future, and we'll shape some of our discussion

22
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:43,440
today. He's published broadly, scientifically and publicly, a study of paintings on

23
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,800
of subjects with psychotic illnesses that's coming out, I believe. I'm planning that.

24
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,080
And a series and also forthcoming a series of essays about culture and the brain.

25
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,320
So welcome. Thank you very much for agreeing to talk to me.

26
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,920
That was a huge pleasure, Jordan. Thank you very much.

27
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:10,800
So one of the things I was rereading the introduction to your new book this morning,

28
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,600
and I was struck by many different topics, but I was particularly interested in your

29
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:27,040
conception of attention. And so you talk about attention as something that in some sense brings

30
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,920
things into being. I don't think that's a misreading of your writing. And maybe I could

31
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,080
get you to expound on that a bit and to tell me what you think attention is, because I've had a

32
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,280
hell of a time differentiating it from, well, from fluid intelligence, for example, or from

33
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,640
consciousness. It's a word that makes sense when you hear it in the context of a bunch of other

34
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,000
words, but when you extract it out from that context and try to grip it, it falls apart in

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,880
your grasp. So I think one could say that attention is the way in which the individual disposes

36
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:11,600
his or her attention. It's a disposition of one's consciousness. So attention is how you

37
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,680
dispose your consciousness towards the world. And when I discovered, when I was researching

38
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,680
the master and his emissary, the book that's now 10 years old,

39
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:30,560
I came across this fascinating thing that one of the most fundamental differences

40
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,720
between the hemispheres is their way of attending. And it didn't entirely hit me at the time how

41
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,640
important it is. But we can talk about that later. But you were asking the rather sort of

42
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,920
interesting philosophical question about how attention helps to bring things into being.

43
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:56,320
And I think it does both generally and rather in a very particular sense in the left hemisphere.

44
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,640
Generally, what I mean is that how you attend to the world depends,

45
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,880
you know, on that depends what world you find. The qualities of the world that comes to your

46
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,600
attention is determined by the quality of the attention you bring to it. And

47
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:23,600
that's a very significant statement. I was talking to someone the other day who's somewhat

48
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,800
theologically minded. And he was also very interested in the role that attention played on

49
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,520
in constituting the world. I mean, you pay attention to things that you value one way or

50
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:44,080
another. And what that means is that the world tends to manifest itself in relationship to

51
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:51,760
your value structure. And that that's a very troublesome idea, in some sense, with regards

52
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:58,000
to our conceptions of the objective world, because it's not easy to it's not easy to parse out what's

53
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,400
objective, when what manifests itself to you is dependent in large part on what you value.

54
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,960
It's very complicated to sort that all out.

55
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:15,600
Well, possibly very much later, we can come to the question of what objective and subjective

56
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:24,240
mean and how one can, I think it's a mistaken dichotomy. I think one can interpret the words

57
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,360
interpret the words in important ways that give them meaning. But I think to think of the just

58
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,520
being an objective world out there and a subjective world in here is one of the problems with

59
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,520
modern Western philosophy. But to come back to the creation of the world, I was going to say that

60
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,640
not only does it sort of bring into the world the world that you know, which is after all by

61
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:52,640
definition the only world you will ever know. But it also changes who you are. So the quality of

62
00:06:52,640 --> 00:07:02,000
the attention you pay changes you, the attender. So it's a very profound difference. And in the

63
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,920
first book, the master and his emissary, one of the things I was expounding was how this business

64
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:20,160
of attention creates a whole distinct world. So the hemispheres have evolved to two different

65
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,120
sets of values. You mentioned values, and it's very germane. They have different

66
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,800
reasons for existing and therefore have different things they respond to.

67
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:43,280
And what I have tried to explain in that book is that this gives rise to a whole way

68
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,680
of seeing the world in a whole world, which is not just for the individual, but also

69
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,840
at times it becomes the way of looking at the world for a whole culture. Because of course,

70
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,120
as individuals, never entirely distinct from our culture. We're partly created by our culture and

71
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:06,720
make it what it is. So it's a very fundamental thing. Well, you take pains in the master and his

72
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:15,280
emissary to promote the idea or to call attention to the idea that something extremely mysterious

73
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:22,320
is going on in relationship to hemispheric specialization. So it's a very ancient phenomenon.

74
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,600
Many creatures or most creatures with developed nervous systems have a bifurcated brain.

75
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,960
And the hemispheres differ substantially in terms of their neuroanatomical structure.

76
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:43,760
And the question arises, why is it necessary, assuming that that differentiation of structure

77
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,960
reflects some profound differentiation of function, why is it necessary to look at the world,

78
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:56,240
so to speak, in two ways? And why is it so necessary that that bifurcation is conserved

79
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,640
across evolutionary history? You'd think that one way would be sufficient, but it doesn't seem to be.

80
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,480
And so the first question is, why do you have to look at the world in two ways?

81
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,960
And the next question might be, well, what are those two ways? One of the things you outlined

82
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,800
that's particularly fascinating to me is that the right hemisphere seems to be specialized

83
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,880
more for what you don't know, whereas the left hemisphere is specialized more for what you do

84
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:33,920
know. And I've sort of defined knowing pragmatically, you know something if you undertake an action and

85
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,720
the outcome is what you specified. And you don't know something if you undertake an action and

86
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,720
the outcome is other than what you specified. And that sort of reflects that novelty visualization

87
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,960
division that was Goldberg, I believe, that originated that, that the neuropsychologist.

88
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,760
Well, Jordan, you've raised a whole bunch of points there. So I need a little bit of time to

89
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:08,800
to explain that. First of all, every neural network that we know of is asymmetrical,

90
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,160
going down to the very most basic network that we know, and the most ancient one that we know.

91
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:22,400
Nemetostellavictensis, a CNM and E that is 700 million years old is already asymmetrical in its

92
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,800
neural network. And that's the earliest neural network we know of. And it's true of insects,

93
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,560
it's true of worms, it's true of, you know, all the way up to human beings. And the three questions

94
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:41,120
that really got me going on this was if the brain is there for making connections and its power is

95
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,040
largely lies in the question, the connections it can make, why is it divided down the middle,

96
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,280
whoppingly divided? I mean, most people don't realize quite how big this this differentiation

97
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:59,360
is and if they haven't actually seen a brain. The second thing is why is it asymmetrical?

98
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,520
Because if you just need to grow this brain, you'd grow it symmetrically, the skull that

99
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:09,040
contains it is symmetrical. And the third thing is why is the connection, the principal connection

100
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,640
between the two hemispheres at the base of the hemispheres, the corpus callosum, why is it at

101
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:22,000
least as much if not more in the service of inhibition than facilitation? So it's as though

102
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,360
there's something really important about keeping two things apart. Now, my hypothesis,

103
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:36,400
and it's just that, is that this results from something that all creatures need to do.

104
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,880
All creatures without exception need to eat and not be eaten. They need to live and to manipulate

105
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,040
their environment, to get food, to catch something, to pick something up quickly,

106
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,160
deftly, to pick up a twig, to build a nest. In other words, for all the kind of day to day stuff,

107
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,640
food, shelter, they need to be able to manipulate the world very precisely. But at the same time,

108
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:07,040
they must pay a precisely opposite kind of attention, which is sustained, vigilant, open

109
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:14,800
without presupposition to as to what it may find. And so on the whole, the way in which this has

110
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:22,240
been addressed by evolution is that there are two neuronal masses that can direct attention at the

111
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:29,040
world. And the left hemisphere tends to specialize in targeted precise attention, and the right hemisphere

112
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,680
in a much broader, vigilant kind of attention, which actually sustains the being of the world.

113
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,040
Nothing about these tiny fragments that are isolated, disconnected, meaningless

114
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,440
gives you any idea of their meaning. It's only when you see the broad picture, and you understand

115
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,360
that they're not actually things that go to be put together to make that broad picture,

116
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,760
but are things that are isolated out of an already connected picture. So that's the

117
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,280
basis of that. I just wanted to pick up your thing about, because I don't think it's quite right to

118
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,000
say that the left hemisphere is about what you know, and the right's about what you don't know.

119
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:15,520
Somebody, I can't remember who, some philosopher said, that knowledge is what we're uncertain of.

120
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,320
The things we're certain of are things that we don't really know properly. I think there's a

121
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,560
good deal of truth in that. The left hemisphere tends to jump to conclusions. It's much more

122
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,800
quick and dirty than the right hemisphere. The right hemisphere is the one that says,

123
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,600
hang on, wait a moment, you may be getting this wrong, because it wants to get things quickly.

124
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,200
Its job is to manipulate. Its job is to get. It's to catch. It's to grab stuff. It's the

125
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:47,040
one that controls the right hand that does all the grabbing. So the left hemisphere tends to

126
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:53,040
price certainty, and it's very uncomfortable when there's ambivalence. Whereas the right

127
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,240
hemisphere- Well, what is that ambivalence you can't act?

128
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,760
Exactly. Whereas the right hemisphere seems to appreciate the possibility that we have to hold

129
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:09,920
multiple views, multiple possibilities together. And so it has a quite different

130
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:18,480
take on reality. It's more interested in discovery and exploration rather than capture.

131
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,760
The left hemisphere is more interested in capturing a thing that it thinks it knows, often,

132
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:28,080
you know, not in any deep way. It's just identified an object it needs. But to understand things,

133
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,920
the right hemisphere is better. And the idea of the master and the emissary is,

134
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:38,640
I won't go through the myth of it. I've explained it so many times, but the basic idea is that the

135
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,280
master, the right hemisphere, knows that it needs an emissary to do the sort of functional

136
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:49,200
administration work. So it's aware that the stuff that it mustn't get involved with and that it

137
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:56,000
can't know. Whereas the left hemisphere knows everything as it were in its eyes, because

138
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,760
it only knows a tiny bit, which is explicit. And, you know, there it is in broad daylight,

139
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:08,880
down in black and white, no shades of meaning, no nuances, nothing implicit about it.

140
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,480
So it thinks it knows it. And if you like the downfall of the left hemisphere, and therefore,

141
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:22,640
I would go with the society, the civilization, as it once was that we belong to, is that the

142
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,640
left hemisphere doesn't know what it is it doesn't know. It's, you know, it's, you know,

143
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,120
the famous thing they're done in Kruger effect. The more you know, the more you think you don't

144
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,160
know. And the people who know least think they know everything. It's a little, that's not quite

145
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,600
fair, but there's something of that about it. Yeah. But can I pick up something that I touched on

146
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,680
earlier? We're talking about creating the world through attention. And I think that is, that is

147
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,480
true. And there's a very big question there about what I mean by that. Do I mean just as you say

148
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:03,600
subjectively or objectively? And maybe we should part that for the moment. But I don't mean either

149
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,600
in a very simple way. But what is fascinating is that the right hemisphere, as I say, knows that

150
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,840
there are things that it's not aware of. But the left hemisphere seems to take the attitude

151
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:22,800
that if it's not attending to it, it doesn't exist. This is very dramatic in clinical neurology.

152
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:30,720
So people who've had a right hemisphere stroke, they not only, as it were, don't now pay attention

153
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,880
to something, but they deny that that thing ever existed. There's a wonderful, you know,

154
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:44,080
very rich accounts of patients. One of the ones that I really like is an experiment done by,

155
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,880
who was it, Biziak and Lutsati, I think, back in the late 1970s, where they got a couple of highly

156
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:57,120
educated people with right hemisphere strokes. And they were in Milan at the time. And they said,

157
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,080
you know, these people lived in Milan. And they said, imagine you're standing in the Piazza del Duomo

158
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:10,320
in front of the cathedral and looking at the square. Describe all the buildings in the square.

159
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:15,040
And they would describe only the ones on the right side that the left hemisphere only pays attention

160
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,680
to. Whereas you know, but I need to say for the viewers that the right hemisphere pays attention

161
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:25,680
to both halves of the world. So when you have a left hemisphere stroke, the world is relatively

162
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,880
preserved globally. But after a right hemisphere stroke, you're only relying on this left hemisphere

163
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,120
who's interested in the bit of space which it can manipulate, the bit on the right. So they named

164
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,920
the buildings down the right hand side of the view of the square they had then.

165
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,240
And then the experimenters had asked them to go to the other end of the square and look at the

166
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:50,400
cathedral facade and name the buildings. And this time they named all the ones down the other side

167
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,080
of the square, but didn't mention any of the ones they just mentioned. So there's something,

168
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,680
it's been commented by one philosopher that it's almost like there's an ontological landslide.

169
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:07,440
Things come in and out of existence for the left hemisphere. And when it was pointed out to these

170
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,560
people what they'd missed, they became angry, irritable and frustrated, which is a typical

171
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:23,120
left hemisphere emotional town, impatient to dismiss this. So I think that's intriguing. I mean,

172
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,920
it's just one image. I mean, the very dramatic one is to do with denying that you have parts of the

173
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:35,920
body. And as was pointed out by Pritz Langler, I think way back in the second decade of the 20th

174
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:42,000
century, they don't only deny after a right hemisphere stroke that they have the left

175
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,080
half of the body, which is not functioning because of the right hemisphere stroke,

176
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,400
they will become very irritable if questions are asked about it or they will just go blank.

177
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,760
I mean, they will be talking perfectly coherently and then they're asked about that and they will

178
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:02,480
go stum, or they will become very irritated. And if you force them to recognize that they have a

179
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,920
body on that side, although they're perfectly intelligent people, they know they must always

180
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,480
have had a left half of their body, they will deny it. And he says it's as though they never had a

181
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,040
left half of the body. It's not only that it's not there now, it never was for them and never will

182
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:21,680
be. Now that's what I mean when I say that there are different levels of creativity of the world

183
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:27,440
or the creation of the world through attention, I should say, in the two hemispheres.

184
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:34,000
Now you're in your new book, and to some degree in the master and his emissary, you're also making,

185
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,480
you're mixing your neurological analysis with philosophical speculation and you're trying to

186
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:47,920
solve a problem. So maybe you could tell us what the problem is and then we can discuss the solution.

187
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:56,400
Well, I suppose the problem is the one that I mentioned, that there is a puzzle about why

188
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,480
brains are set up in this rather odd way. But you're also pointing to a kind of philosophical

189
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:12,320
malaise, right? So there's a conceptual problem, but also an emotional or broad-scale philosophical

190
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,720
problem. And there is, there is indeed. And indeed, if I may say so, the book that I hope will come

191
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:25,040
out fairly soon called The Matter with Things, which is a pun on several levels, because I think

192
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:31,520
it's a critique not only of the way we think now, but of our obsession with thinking of the world

193
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:37,680
as composed of things and that only matter exists. But anyway, in that book, what I'm really trying

194
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,720
to do is marry science and philosophy again. They never should have been separated. Science

195
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,800
cannot properly be done by philosophy without philosophy. Many scientists and philosophers

196
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,280
have commented on this over the years, and the divorce has been disastrous for them both.

197
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,320
You get a mindless kind of science that jumps to very naive conclusions that everything is

198
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:05,600
mechanical. And you get a kind of philosophy that thinks it's above dirtying its hands with science.

199
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:14,480
Now, I think each of these parties can benefit from a rapprochement, which is long overdue.

200
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,880
And it's that that I try to do in this very big book to show how strands of neurology, philosophy,

201
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:28,960
and physics, and even of world mythologies come together to show the same very similar pictures,

202
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:36,400
the same Gestalten, the same differences between a world such as the world brought into being by

203
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,400
the left hemisphere and a world such as is brought into being by the right hemisphere.

204
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,760
And perhaps if we're going on any further, you did invite me earlier to say something about

205
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,360
what those differences are. Well, to try and sum it up very quickly, what I'd say is for the left

206
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:59,520
hemisphere, things are known, familiar, literally things that are unfamiliar are better dealt with

207
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,600
by the right hemisphere until the left hemisphere can go, oh, I see, it's one of those and put it

208
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:10,000
in the category box. They're more distinct. In fact, they're probably entirely fragmentary or

209
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,440
isolated in the left hemisphere, whereas there the right hemisphere sees that nothing is ever

210
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:23,120
ultimately unconnected from everything else. Things in the left hemisphere are frozen.

211
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,480
They don't move. They don't change. Things in the right hemisphere are constantly flowing and changing,

212
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,960
although flowing and changing and remaining the same are not necessarily

213
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:45,360
an opposition. As we know, Heraclitus, my favorite philosopher, said, by changing, it remains the

214
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,440
same, which is the image of a river which is never, ever still for a moment, but the river

215
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:56,240
outside my house that was there at breakfast time is probably there now. So in that sense,

216
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,760
it's remained. And we're all, I believe, like these rivers are all living beings are. In fact,

217
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,120
probably everything that exists is as Heraclitus pointed out. So what are the things? The left

218
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:13,680
hemisphere abstracts. It tends to abstract from the body. It tends to abstract from the context.

219
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:20,080
And something I learned very early on in life was the importance of context, how it utterly changes

220
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,320
anything that somebody says or any image. And this is particularly true, of course, of literature,

221
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,920
which I studied and taught for a certain while when I was a young man,

222
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,040
that once you start paraphrasing a poem and taking its sentiments out of the context,

223
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:42,960
they've utterly changed themselves and no longer what they were. And the left hemisphere is more

224
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,480
interested in categories, the right hemisphere in the unique case. So it sees that you're not just

225
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,360
a member of a certain group, you take certain boxes, you fall into that category,

226
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,120
but that you're massively complicatedly different. And I mean, this has a very real basis, you know,

227
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,800
when you look at neurological patients, people who have right hemisphere strokes or examples,

228
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:12,240
to I know of that both come from the same research group in Switzerland, but involve

229
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:21,520
a farmer who used to know all his cows by name. And after the right hemisphere right parietal stroke,

230
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,760
he couldn't really, well, he not only couldn't tell his cows one from another,

231
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,480
but he could hardly tell a cow from a horse. And another woman who very plaintively

232
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,040
commented after a right hemisphere stroke, she'd spent her whole life studying the birds of

233
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,880
Switzerland, she was an authority on them. And she said, all the birds look the same.

234
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:46,240
So that's what happens in the left hemisphere world. Quality is replaced by quantity,

235
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:54,720
uniqueness is replaced by the category. And then again, the left hemisphere

236
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:04,480
tends to see things as inanimate, where the right hemisphere will see them as animate.

237
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:13,600
Well, a category implies in some sense that the members of that category are indistinguishable,

238
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,200
right? Because otherwise you don't have a category, you just have particularity. And so

239
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,600
you could imagine that, I mean, to understand this completely, you have to understand to some

240
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:32,800
degree what categories are for, or what categories are for, at least in part, you put things that you

241
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:40,960
can act towards the same way in the same category. And so young children might think of cats and

242
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:49,040
dogs as dogs, all of them as dogs, because they're cuddly, pettable entities, not because they have

243
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:53,360
four legs or because they have fur, but because you interact with them the same way. Then you can

244
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,360
differentiate cats and dogs as you get a little older. But the first category, dog, which is pettable

245
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:05,760
things, is a perfectly reasonable category. And you can imagine that once a categorical structure

246
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:12,160
has been imposed, that it's easy just to see the category. I wrote an essay in my new book,

247
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:19,040
which is called Beyond Order, about the function of artists. And I believe that part of what artists

248
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:23,680
do, and I think this is maybe, you can tell me, but I think it might reflect the differences that

249
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:31,440
you're talking about. When I was a kid, I lived in a small town, and I can remember all the houses

250
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,680
on my block. I can remember them in detail. They're familiar to me as individual entities, but

251
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:44,880
now that I'm an adult, I've lived on this street for like 20 years, but the houses are indistinguishable

252
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,960
to me. I can't see them as different entities. And I think it's because I'm so familiar with the

253
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:57,360
category house, which is a practical category, that I can't see beyond the category. And it's

254
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,560
very efficient, because I know what houses do. They sit there. You don't have to pay attention to

255
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:09,760
them. And so it's really a useful perceptual shorthand just to see the category. But what

256
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,800
an artist will do is take you outside the category and make you see that the particular is, again,

257
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:20,640
that you're missing. And I guess that's partly the context, to remind you of what's beyond

258
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:28,720
what your memory forces you now to see. And is that akin to this distinction that you're

259
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:34,560
making between the left and the right? Well, it is a distinction. It's a related distinction,

260
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:40,240
but not exactly the same distinction. I mean, interestingly, it relates to the difference,

261
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,080
a very important difference. In fact, I think probably the single most important difference

262
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,320
of all, which doesn't first strike people, partly because they're so used to living in a world of

263
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,960
representations. That is the distinction between the presencing of something as it comes into being

264
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:03,360
for you and your mental representation of it, which is like a caricature, or a category thing,

265
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:14,480
or a verbal sign, so that the left hemisphere's addiction, if you like, to understanding things

266
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:23,200
via language is very important. Because after all, language makes everything the same. As

267
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,520
Nietzsche said, it makes the uncommon common. Because when you say somebody's got brown hair

268
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,320
or something, then you've got everything just like in a category. But when you see that person,

269
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,200
there's something quite different about the way their hair is and so forth. And you'd find that

270
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,960
out if you painted it. Because you wouldn't paint it with brown paint. You'd paint it with a multitude

271
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,760
of colors if you were really looking at it. And you'd see that it wasn't brown. And I mean,

272
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,360
artists play with, was it Manet who painted the haystacks or Monet, I don't remember,

273
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,760
at multiple different times of the year? And the haystack, I mean, the shape was the same,

274
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,320
but the haystack was completely different. And that's really, in some sense, what he was portraying

275
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:15,760
was the category is haystack, but the reality is extraordinarily complex. But the category

276
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:22,560
seems to have functional significance. So you dump things together that you can act towards the same

277
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:31,040
way. And then a word is labeled on top of that to serve as an even further compressed shorthand

278
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:39,360
for that category. So you have a complex world, it's multitudinous, and too complex to even see.

279
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:46,640
And then there's a perceptual act that categorizes that into like a perceptual image house, say,

280
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:52,640
and then there's a further compression and eradication of information that enables that

281
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:59,280
to be represented by a word. Well, the Greek philologist Max Muller said,

282
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:05,760
it's interesting that we read encyclopedias, we have dictionaries, we read books, and we are

283
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:14,080
with all these words, but none of the things that these words represent actually exist,

284
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,800
because in the act of being represented, they are no longer the thing that was present,

285
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,480
the very fact of representing it suddenly stops the presence of the thing. For me,

286
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,480
this is very vivid in Wordsworth. And this comes back to some of the things you were saying about

287
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:34,880
the liveliness of the childhood mind, that when he was a young man, and 50 years a boy,

288
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:41,120
rambling in the Lake District, the world was very much still alive to him and coming into

289
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:47,760
being for him, but that as a man, he went back there and as it were, couldn't avoid seeing

290
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:54,240
the landscape as, oh, a picturesque mountain, a picturesque lake, one of those if you like.

291
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,400
And this is what he means by the phrase, the shades of the prison house,

292
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:08,400
closing round the growing boy in his intimations of immortality on reflection in early childhood.

293
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:17,760
So this is from this book. There was a time when Meadow groven streamed the earth and every

294
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,440
common sight, to me did seem appareled in celestial light, the glory and the freshness

295
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,200
of a dream. Yes. That's it. This is what I'm referring to. And this really is one of the

296
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:35,840
more important differences. I would say probably the core difference, that as it were, one world

297
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:44,800
is real, vibrant, unknown in part, only known ever to a degree, and ever more coming into being,

298
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:49,440
and ever more coming into knowledge for the right hemisphere. And for the left hemisphere,

299
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,800
already cold, finished, known, dead, put in a book, stuffed on the shelf, filed away.

300
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:02,160
And we now live so much in this virtual, represented world, partly because they're

301
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:08,480
very much cut off from nature, which constantly reminds you of its vivid, uncertain liveliness.

302
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:15,040
It confronts you with its audacious beauty and vitality all the time, partly because we've

303
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:20,880
learnt to cut our minds off from our bodies. And so we think in this enormously abstract way,

304
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:27,120
and partly because of city life, partly because of technology, which means we interact with two

305
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,240
dimensional screens, rather than the three dimensional depth, which is in a room when

306
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:38,160
you're with someone, which is why, as you know, and I know, because we've both helped patients

307
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:43,680
in our time, that it's very important to be in the room with the patient. It's a completely

308
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,720
different thing that happens from anything you can do on the telephone, or even like this.

309
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,960
So part of the philosophical case that you're making is, I believe that,

310
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:05,840
while we have a terrible conundrum as human beings, we need, in some sense, for the purposes of

311
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:12,080
efficiency to move towards the most efficient representations possible. And this has real

312
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,880
bearing on the nature of perception itself. So I know, for example, that even in the primary

313
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:23,520
visual cortex, so in principle, you know this, but I'm going to explain it for people who are listening,

314
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,080
as the signals, as the pattern signals from your retina move back towards your brain,

315
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:37,840
they move upwards, so to speak, through a hierarchy of processing units. And even at the first stages

316
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:44,400
of that processing, there's still more top down input from other brain centers than there is input

317
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:49,280
from the retinal structures themselves. And so what that implies is that even at the beginnings

318
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:54,880
of perception, you know, if you think about it as being built up from perceptual elements up

319
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,680
towards the whole gestalt, which isn't exactly accurate, but it'll do for now, even at the

320
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:04,400
beginnings of the visual process, there's more input from what's inside than there is from the

321
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:09,680
external world, so to speak, or at least as much. And then what seems to happen as we age is that,

322
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:17,520
perhaps, is that increasingly, that perception becomes solipsistic. And so we're only seeing

323
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,080
what we know. And that's extraordinarily efficient, because it's very hard to build up a new perception.

324
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,360
You have to really investigate something in detail to see it anew. Whereas if it's the

325
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:32,320
same old thing that you've seen 10,000 times, you can already use what you know. And it's not

326
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,480
surprising you'd be annoyed if you were forced to jump out of that, because there's a tremendous

327
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,720
amount of work that has to be done if you want to see something for the first time again.

328
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:50,160
Well, as we both know, people would rather deny obvious truths than let go of a cherished belief.

329
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:59,600
So that's certainly right. And we don't perceive the world as, you know, in a naive way. We come

330
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:06,880
to the world with our history, with our vast range of experience. And so, as you say, this top-down

331
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,560
effects on the lower end of things, of the lower end of perception, from higher cognitive functions.

332
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,320
But that's an image of something very important to the philosophy I try to put across in the

333
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:27,120
matter with things, which is that in order to understand any element in experience,

334
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:37,360
it's at least as important to see what holes it goes to make up, or potentially can go to make up,

335
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:42,960
as it is to see what it turns into when you break it down. In fact, often it's not very revealing

336
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,080
to find out what happens when you break it down. And so, in a way-

337
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:52,960
Psychology suffers from that. Psychology is a discipline that consists, at least in its present

338
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:59,520
form, mostly of disparate experiments, which demonstrate very particular things about how

339
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:06,560
people behave in very particular circumstances. But there's very little that unites that back up

340
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:14,000
to something that isn't merely fragmentary observation. And so, it's very difficult to get

341
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:21,040
a grip on. And there's billions of potential separate observations. And they're not that

342
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,880
helpful in some sense. Well, it's all part of the world picture, which from the philosophical

343
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:33,760
point of view is the purpose of the long book, which I sent to you in manuscript, The Matter

344
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:42,240
with Things. And effectively, I can state quite simply that I want to give a considered

345
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:51,360
response to the philosophy of our age, which is that there is only matter, and that things

346
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:58,160
are understood by reducing them to their parts, unless it doesn't change them. It's a very naive

347
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:05,360
philosophy. It's simplistic, and it's immoral, because it changes the way we treat the world

348
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:12,320
and other people and nature. It changes our idea of who we are in a very damaging way,

349
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:18,160
ruling out things that other traditions have traditionally held as very powerful.

350
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,000
And coming back to your comment about how people cling on to things that they believe,

351
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,960
and it's much more difficult to try and see something in a different way, especially with age.

352
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,680
This is why, of course, most traditions of spiritual growth

353
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,800
enjoin on the person paradoxes, to see things in a completely new way that violates all the

354
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:49,920
ways that they thought they knew. So I use paradox in this new book, but not in some blind way.

355
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:56,800
In fact, I show that what we mean by a paradox is that the view of the left hemisphere of something

356
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,680
and the view taken of the right hemisphere of the same thing can never actually completely

357
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:09,440
marry up. They have different qualities, and if you push the comparison or the desire to make

358
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,120
them logically come together too far, you end up with a paradox. And this started happening

359
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:24,080
early on in the ancient Greek period of philosophy with Xeno. This is where the first

360
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:30,880
paradoxes come from, and I have a whole chapter on paradox, which I see as generated by the desire

361
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,160
of the left hemisphere to say it must be this or it must be that, clinging on preferentially to the

362
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:42,000
very fragmentary view of the left hemisphere. See, the left hemisphere is not good at understanding.

363
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,000
That sounds a very blanket statement, and it is. But the whole of the first part of that book,

364
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:57,280
the new book, is massively more thorough neuropsychology than is in the master and his emissary.

365
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,360
So it's about as thorough as I could possibly make it. And what I do is I look at the ways

366
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:09,120
in which we have any chance of getting an idea of what the world is. What are the portals of entry

367
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:16,800
of, if you like, information about the world to us? And I take it that it depends very much on

368
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,640
our attention, how we dispose our attention, perception, the judgments we form on the basis

369
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:32,640
of perception, the ways in which we apprehend what we're dealing with, rather than comprehend it,

370
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:39,040
in other words, grasp it, as we say, with the right hand of the left hemisphere, take it, use it.

371
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:47,440
And how we understand it in terms of emotional intelligence, which is not a small thing,

372
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,000
it's the whole way in which we understand everything human by emotional, I don't mean

373
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,000
sort of in some, you know what I mean, I'm talking about social and emotional understanding,

374
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,440
the sort of thing that is absent in people with autism. And cognitive intelligence,

375
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:09,360
this may surprise people, but that all these things and creativity, so creativity,

376
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:17,040
intelligence of the cognitive kind, IQ kind, emotional and social intelligence, apprehension

377
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:24,080
is a separate case, I'll come to that in a second, perception and attention and judgment,

378
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:29,680
all these are better performed by the right hemisphere, only apprehension is better performed

379
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,800
by the left hemisphere. So the only thing the left hemisphere is better at is getting a hold on

380
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:43,680
either an idea, very precise, clear one, or on a thing that it wants to use, but all the manifold

381
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,400
complexity, which our intelligence brings to bear in order to understand the world, all of that is

382
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:54,400
better done by the right hemisphere. And I can say that on the basis not just of experiments in

383
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,520
normal subjects, but on seeing what happens when you have either left hemisphere damage or right

384
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:05,680
hemisphere damage, to summarize a vast chunk of information, which I hope will be there for

385
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:13,120
people to read very, very soon. To summarize that very briefly, what one would say is that when you

386
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:18,720
have damage to the right hemisphere, your grasp of reality is the main thing that's impaired,

387
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,680
you don't understand it, you don't connect with it, your ability to understand what's going on,

388
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,960
disappears. Whereas when you have a right hemisphere, sorry, when you have a,

389
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,480
that's when you have a right hemisphere, when you have a left hemisphere stroke,

390
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,160
the main things are you have difficulty speaking and using your right hand, they're

391
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:42,080
practically very important, but essentially the understanding of the world, the grasp of the

392
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:47,520
meaning of the world, so we have to use these words grasp again, but the overall comprehension

393
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,120
of the world is sustained by the right hemisphere. Okay, so let me ask you a question. Can I,

394
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:59,840
sure, go ahead. All right, okay. All right, okay, let me just make this point. Because I want to,

395
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:05,120
people might say, well, okay, but so what? We've both got right and left hemispheres,

396
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,560
so we're not missing anything, so does it matter? Well, yes, it matters very importantly for my

397
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:17,040
philosophical project, because as I show in the second part of the book, where I look at the proper

398
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,680
contributions to understanding made by reason, science, intuition and imagination,

399
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:34,880
what I can show is that in those attempts to grasp, we can see the world, we can see the

400
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,840
signature of the right hemisphere or the signature of the left hemisphere on a particular model.

401
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:46,720
So if we have two possible models of a certain action or an aspect of reality or space or time,

402
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,680
which I deal with in the third part of the book, and indeed in philosophical history and in the

403
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:58,080
history of physics and so on, there have tended to be opposing views of the world. Once you know

404
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:03,040
how the left hemisphere sees it and how the right hemisphere tends to see things, you can see the

405
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:09,120
hallmark of the left hemisphere's understanding on a certain philosophical standpoint, on a certain

406
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:17,520
scientific take of the world, and you can see the hallmark and the imprint of the right hemisphere

407
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:23,760
in certain other ways of reasoning and of science and philosophy. So this is very important,

408
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,120
because up till now, we've never been able to judge between these two. We've got A, we've got B,

409
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:33,760
we just have to go, hmm, can't tell, we can't reconcile them, we can't do without either of them.

410
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:42,080
That's true, ultimately that's true, but we can get a very sharp idea, I believe now,

411
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,760
of which of these is fallacious, which one is going to lead us down a blind alley, which one

412
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,640
is out of touch with reality and which one is more in touch with reality. I just wanted to say that,

413
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:58,160
because it's behind the whole philosophical drift of my book, which is how do we know who we are?

414
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:04,400
I asked Plotinus his question, who are we? That's effectively the question, what is the cosmos,

415
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:12,080
what is nature, and how do we all relate? Sorry, I hand over to you. No, no, that's good. Okay, so

416
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:20,720
to do something, you have to zero in on it. So let me lay something out for you, and then I'm

417
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,600
going to ask you a specific question about it. So imagine that I'm concentrating on the computer

418
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:29,760
screen, I'm attending to it, I'm writing a book. Okay, so the question might be, well, what am I

419
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:37,360
doing while I'm writing that book? What is it to write that book? Well, at the most focused level

420
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:45,520
of my consciousness, the most focal level, that involves voluntary control of my fingers. I'm going

421
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,080
to be typing single letters, and there are muscle movements that are associated with that, but I

422
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:54,640
don't really know what the muscle movements are, I know how to move my fingers, that's the highest

423
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:00,000
level of resolution I can manage. I can press T with my left hand and H with my right hand,

424
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:07,760
with these two fingers. And so that's sort of where the pedal hits the metal, in some sense,

425
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:14,320
that's where my intent meets the world. Okay, so, but I'm not typing letters, sorry, I am typing

426
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:19,440
letters, but at the same time I'm typing words. And at the same time I'm typing words, I'm typing

427
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:26,080
phrases. And then I'm typing sentences, and I'm typing paragraphs, and I'm typing chapters,

428
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:31,600
and then I'm typing books. And then the book itself is an artifact that's nested inside

429
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:38,160
higher order structures. So, well, I'm writing the book, but the reason I can write the book is

430
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:46,720
because I'm imagining a world within which the book is nested. And so I'm focusing on something

431
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:52,080
very specific, like I can't write the book without pushing the letter T with my left index finger,

432
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:57,760
but I also can't write the book without apprehending the book as a whole. And, you know, when I edit,

433
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:04,000
I edit not letters because I can spell, but I edit words, I substitute one word for another,

434
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,120
I edit phrases, I edit sentences, I edit at the paragraph level, like all of these levels actually

435
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:16,880
exist. Now, is it reasonable to suppose? So, sorry, I'm going to add one more level outside

436
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,600
that. So you might ask, well, why am I writing a book? And it might be, well, because I'm a

437
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:30,160
practicing scientist, and why is that important? Well, I'm a dutiful citizen, let's say, trying

438
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,080
to uphold my moral responsibility. And you might say, well, why is that important? And I would say,

439
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:41,280
well, that's part of my proper moral engagement with the world. And then I can't go further

440
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:47,360
outside than that. Now, is it reasonable to suppose, if you think about that whole structure as a kind

441
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:53,520
of lens that focuses us in the world, is it reasonable to suppose that it's the left hemisphere,

442
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:59,200
so to speak, that's concentrating on the T's and the H's, and that as you move up that hierarchy

443
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:05,440
to broader and broader levels of conceptualization, that the manner in which those higher levels

444
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,960
are conceptualized shifts more and more to the right, or is processed more and more by the

445
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:14,240
right, is that a reasonable way of looking at it? I think you could, but I'd need to sort of gloss

446
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:22,160
it a bit. And what you've beautifully described is what the right hemisphere knows, and which

447
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:27,840
John Muir summarized by saying, if you try to get hold of any one thing and pull it, you find that

448
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,560
bring with it the whole of the rest of the universe, yet that sentence you're writing

449
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:39,680
is informed by your personal history and the history, therefore, of your culture,

450
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:45,680
and therefore, and so on and so on and so forth. So everything that has gone to make you is present

451
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:52,720
in that business of the book. And so you're not, of course, at any one time aware of more than a

452
00:47:52,720 --> 00:48:00,960
tiny bit. But there's a very fallacious and superficial argument that if you're not conscious of

453
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:06,960
it, in that sense of the word conscious, then somehow you're not doing it. But of course you are,

454
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:13,760
the whole thing emanates from what I call the field of view. Now, suppose rather than, you know,

455
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,480
we can take the example of the typing, but you wouldn't be able to type at all if you were

456
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:25,360
thinking about what your fingers were doing. And, you know, but nonetheless, it would be stupid to

457
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,880
say that you're unconscious while you're typing. Of course, you're not unconscious.

458
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:35,280
Somebody playing a Bach fugue has got to use all their fingers and their hands, you know,

459
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:40,640
and their feet at the same time. And if they concentrated, they could only concentrate and

460
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:45,680
focus on one finger. Of course, that would stop the whole music for a start. But they're, they're

461
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,920
conscious, of course, they're just as conscious when the whole thing's happening as they are if

462
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:56,080
they think about the finger and stop it. So what this illustrates is what Alfred North Whitehead

463
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:04,640
was keen to point out that as soon as we master something, we relegate it to another part of

464
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:11,040
the mind that we don't any longer have to focus on. And the focusing of tension is costly. He said,

465
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:20,000
it's like cavalry charges in battle. It should only be done rarely. You need fresh horses and it

466
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,000
comes at a high cost. So that's a good analogy. Because you build a you build a little machine,

467
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:32,240
the things, the things, the things that the things that we do unconsciously are in no way

468
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:38,160
inferior stuff. So for example, the Bach fugue is not inferior. When a surgeon is learning,

469
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:44,240
he or she has to be very conscious of what he or she's doing, the actual business of the hand

470
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:51,840
cutting. But when the surgeon is very skilled, he can hum, listen to the radio chat with colleagues,

471
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:56,960
and it's all happening. Similarly, a chess player, a bad chess player has to be conscious of every

472
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:02,560
move, but a really good one is not unconscious. It's very, very highly conscious, but it's not

473
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:10,400
focused. Now, my distinction to sorry, finally answer your question is that is that focused

474
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:16,720
attention, this focal attention on the detail is what the left hemisphere does. It can only

475
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:23,280
take in about three degrees for the attentional art. So it's incredibly limited. And as as Whitehead

476
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:30,800
says, it has its uses in an emergency. But really, it's not a satisfactory way for living. And what

477
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:35,920
I think is happening is that we are now more and more saying anything that I'm not actually focusing

478
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:42,320
on right now doesn't exist. All the implicit stuff, all the unconscious stuff, all the things that go

479
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:49,040
to make up the richness of our both cognitive and emotional and embodied cells, isn't really

480
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:55,200
important. We focus down on this tiny bit that the relatively unintelligent left hemisphere

481
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:01,760
knows about and is aware of. So when I say conscious and unconscious, I like to say,

482
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:08,880
don't think of these as two separate realms, like, you know, two tanks with perhaps a trap and things

483
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,920
can pop up from the lower tank into the higher tank or whatever. But instead, think of it like

484
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:19,200
a stage, and there's a spotlight. And the spotlight may just illuminate one part of the

485
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,200
stage, but the rest of the stage hasn't gone anywhere. It's still there. And you just need

486
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:27,280
to move the spotlight. And suddenly it's there again in the middle of what you're thinking about.

487
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:33,680
That's how I would see that question. Okay, so let's go back to this typing example again. Just

488
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:40,800
so when you learn to type, you're going to be paying conscious attention to pushing the T's and

489
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:48,400
the H's. As you learn to type, you start perhaps being conscious more of maybe you're attending

490
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:54,000
at the level of the phrase. Like, you don't have to be consciously attentive to those things you've

491
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:00,560
built automated machinery for. Now they say when kids learn to read, it isn't enjoyable to begin with

492
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:06,720
because it's effortful to learn to process the letters, and it's effortful to learn to process

493
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:12,320
the words. And it's not until they can automatize the letter and word processing, and so they can

494
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:18,160
read the word at a glance, that they start to be able to be conscious of the phrase and the sentence,

495
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,920
and that's when they get the meaning from the text, and that's when it starts to become

496
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:28,000
enjoyable, right? It's not just effortful. And then, so the consciousness of a reader isn't

497
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,160
consciousness of letters, and it's not consciousness of words. It's consciousness of something like

498
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:37,760
the interplay between sentences and paragraphs. And it's like your consciousness floats above

499
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:44,480
the highest level of automatization that you've been able to manage. Does that seem reasonable to

500
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:50,320
you? Well, I mean, when you're playing a musical piece, for example, you don't pay attention to

501
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:55,440
what you've practiced because you've got that. You pay attention to the sequencing of what you've

502
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:01,280
practiced. And the greater a musician you are, the higher up in the abstraction hierarchy,

503
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:07,680
you can focus because you've automated all the lower stuff. Well, yes, and that comes back to

504
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:13,200
what, I'm sorry. No, I was, I was, I'm trying to get the relationship between that and the

505
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:20,000
hemisphere specialization. Well, I think I've done my best to point out that the right hemisphere

506
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:26,560
is the one that is able to attend to the whole Gestalt ultimately is dealing not in

507
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:32,480
fragmentary entities that have to be put together, but in Gestalt and that already exist and are

508
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:38,800
nested so that you go down from one level and you find another, you know, famously you can go from

509
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:44,640
the, from the body to the organ to the tissue to the cell to the organelle to the, you know,

510
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:52,400
and each of these at each stage is a whole that has its own qualities and its own rules

511
00:53:52,400 --> 00:54:00,240
really and works in a semi-autonomous way. So there's always freedom between the levels of

512
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:05,840
understanding. There's always space. It's rather like the gaps in the structure are where the light

513
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:10,560
gets in. You know, if you tighten everything up, then you've got total darkness. So what we're

514
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:16,240
trying to do all the time is to know enough to be able to act, but to leave it open so that we

515
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:21,680
can know more and really understand where we are and what we're doing when we're acting. So I think

516
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:26,720
these are significant differences between the left hemisphere which is utterly goal directed

517
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:35,120
and very direct in the way in which it achieves or aims to achieve its goal and the right hemisphere

518
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:43,120
which is sustaining this and also seeing the goal in a wider whole. You know, the reason of typing

519
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:47,200
these letters is not just to make the keys go up and down and to have a bit of paper at the end of

520
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:53,680
it, but because you want to influence minds that are now unaware of this but will know about it

521
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,800
soon. So I think it's the difference between this very, again, Whitehead says there's a

522
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:06,560
civilization advances by the number of actions that can be made automatic or below the level.

523
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:14,080
Sorry? Without thinking. Without thinking. Because thinking is very complex thing,

524
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:18,960
isn't it? I mean, what is it? And a number of people have commented rather along the lines

525
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:25,920
that I'm saying that it's not so much right to say I think as in Kogito, but in the words of

526
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:34,240
Lichtenberg, the 18th century German philosopher and physicist, esdenkt, esdenkt in mir, something

527
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:41,760
is thinking in me. And that is the me. It's not separate and it's not unconscious in the sense of

528
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:47,920
it has no life, it has no meaning, it has no purpose, it has no direction. Absolutely not,

529
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:53,680
it has all those things. And one of the things I'm trying to argue in the last part of,

530
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:58,320
may I say something just about the structure of this book? I started off on it, this new book

531
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:02,400
and I'm just going to say a little bit more about it. Yeah, yeah. So I've explained the first part.

532
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,800
Yeah, well we're trying to grasp something large going through its parts and it's not such a simple

533
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:12,800
thing to do. It's not a simple thing to do. So the first part of the book I've explained,

534
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:20,720
it gives one an insight into a simple fact that in terms of having access to the reality of the

535
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:27,680
world, the right hemisphere is better than the left. And it has a special take, if you like,

536
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:32,160
which we can recognize so that when we're having to choose between two opposites, we can choose one

537
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,280
if we want to over the other. And then the second part of the book, I'm looking at the

538
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:43,440
pathways to knowledge, using attention, perception, judgment, intelligence, how do we put them to use?

539
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:49,440
Well, I think the main ones are science, reason, I think most people would say they're important,

540
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:56,080
I would say intuition and imagination are also vastly important. Now none of these is infallible,

541
00:56:56,080 --> 00:57:00,720
none of these can say that it can deal with everything. There are proper limits to science,

542
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:08,480
otherwise you're peddling untenable naive scientism. But it is a very important thing

543
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:15,840
for us to respect and to do honorably. Reason is enormously important. I use science and reason

544
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:22,160
as the basis of my book. But again, reason, as Pascal, famous mathematician and philosopher said,

545
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:28,960
reason is poor if it cannot see its own limitations. And so it has limitations,

546
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,760
but it can achieve a very great deal. And the same actually is true of intuition. It's had a

547
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:40,160
very bad press in recent years, because I think, again, psychologists, I think you've alluded to

548
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:44,960
this, they like things that can be taken down into bits and shown them, we can find the mechanism.

549
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:52,160
Intuition is a bit hard for that. And imagination has been, again, relegated to the sort of children's

550
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:59,760
playbox that this is something to do with fantasy. Whereas in fact, I argue that quite the opposite,

551
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,080
but whereas fantasy may be an interesting decoration on things that we already know,

552
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:09,840
and the left hemisphere can do that. Imagination is actually how we go to meet the world and

553
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:15,680
understand it. And we have to imagine it into being. There is no alternative. If we are not

554
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:19,920
imaginatively engaged with the world, we just can't see a lot of things that are there.

555
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:28,800
So we need to use all of these faculties together, not just one or two as we now do. Sorry, Carol.

556
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:35,200
Well, I wanted to comment on your discussion of imagination and the manner in which it brings

557
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:43,040
the world into being. So we've already discussed the fact that the realm of your experience is

558
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:49,280
dependent to some degree on your attention, and that that's associated with intent. And intent

559
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:55,920
seems to me to be it's future oriented to have an intent. Intent means to attempt to move from one

560
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:01,600
place to another. And hypothetically, it's a better place because why move otherwise. And so

561
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:08,880
to act in the world with intent means that you're playing out something that's imaginative because

562
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:15,360
to posit that one thing is better than another, and therefore want to move towards it, you have to

563
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:20,640
have imagined up a better world. And so what that means in some sense is that we're always meeting

564
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:27,360
the world in a way that imposes our imaginative attempts to make it better upon us, upon the

565
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:36,880
world. But that also brings the world into being. And so and I guess I'm saying that because I'm

566
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:43,680
trying to grapple with the why of your book again. You're implying throughout and more than implying

567
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:51,920
that we have a paucity of viewpoint that's demotivating and dangerous. And you're implying as

568
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:57,920
well that that has something to do with our obsessive concentration or utilization of left

569
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:03,360
hemisphere functions. And that that reminds me of Heidegger to some degree and his claim that

570
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:08,720
moderners use the world as produce, you know, that we tend to reduce everything to its functional

571
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:14,000
utility insofar as it can be exploited. And like I have some sympathy for that because we have to

572
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:22,640
the world to live. But yes, it it it. So let's say we do lose something by being specific.

573
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:29,600
And narrow, we gain something which is functional utility. What do we do about that?

574
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,920
You're trying to understand it and why it is what do we do to fight against it?

575
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:41,680
Well, that's a whole separate question. But at the moment, I'm trying to unpack

576
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:48,480
what the problem is. Okay, well, I won't push past that. Yeah, I mean, I mean,

577
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:55,600
quite what we do about it is the million dollar question. And we may not be in a position

578
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:02,240
unless we radically alter the way in which we think about the world, understand it and feel

579
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:09,120
it and experience it and interact with it. We may not have a world in which to live. So it's

580
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:16,960
a pretty important topic. But in so having sort of more or less, as it were, gone over what are

581
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,920
the portals to understanding, what are the paths to understanding, I then in the part three, which

582
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:28,240
is really, if you like, the reason we've had parts one and two, you can't get to part three without

583
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:34,880
them. But when you get there, we want to know, so what is the world like? And so I look at the

584
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:40,400
structure of the world, the theories about it and what we can tell from physics and from

585
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:45,440
the hemisphere hypothesis, what parts of it we may be perceiving with the left hemisphere and what

586
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:51,280
we may be seeing with the right. And I look at the structure in the sense of the coming together

587
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:56,000
of opposites and the very interesting philosophical question of the relationship between the one

588
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:05,600
and the many. And then in the rest of the book, I look at time, space, motion, meaning largely flow,

589
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:18,000
but all kinds of motion, matter and consciousness, value, purpose, and the sense of the sacred.

590
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:25,120
Now, I argue that these elements like consciousness are not secondary, they're not

591
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:30,960
derivative, it's actually irrational to suppose they are. Reason is on the side of the fact that

592
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:38,080
they are ontological primaries. And I argue that actually also unpack that for people because it's

593
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:44,880
there's a lot, but it would take a very long time. Well, I can unpack the phrase what I mean by

594
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:52,960
ontological primary is that it can't be reduced to other terms. It can't be said that as long as

595
01:02:52,960 --> 01:03:00,000
you look at a brain in a certain way, you can work out what consciousness is. Consciousness is

596
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:06,880
sui generis. It is of its own kind. It is not something that is derived from anything. It has

597
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:13,680
to be a primary constituent of the universe. This is not a particularly any longer controversial view.

598
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:22,160
It's held by many philosophers now in the form of panpsychism in which something like consciousness

599
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:28,480
is in the cosmos and the cosmos perhaps exists inside consciousness, not my consciousness, but

600
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:35,840
a consciousness field. And there are plenty of neuroscientists who say this too.

601
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:43,360
Colin Blakemore, not known for being kind of away with the fairies, but they say this too.

602
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:51,760
But I would also argue, and it's a perhaps harder thing to make comprehensible in a very short

603
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:57,280
space, but that actually values are things that are there. They're not things we make up. They're

604
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:07,840
not things that are like, I rather like that. They are built into the drive of everything.

605
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:13,440
And I think that the cosmos has drives. You can describe them in all sorts of ways. It has

606
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:19,760
the fact that it changes and moves in certain ways according to, quote, laws, which may actually

607
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:24,480
not be laws, but maybe temporary habits. We don't know. They may be evolving too. But the very fact

608
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:30,480
that this thing has this energy to evolve, to differentiate, to produce differentiation

609
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:36,880
within union, this is a value of a kind. You can't get behind these. And most of our values,

610
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:42,000
other than those of utility, this is good for me and I want to have more of it, which is what

611
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:50,160
the left hemisphere is devoted to. Most of those other values are not reducible to share in the

612
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:57,120
material greed or feathering your own nest. They're often actually the things that are vastly

613
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:02,240
important. Probably the whole point of the being consciousness at all is to come to appreciate

614
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:08,320
the meaning of truth, goodness and beauty, to have a sense of something awe-inspiring, which is

615
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:12,960
really what we mean when we talk about the sacred, that we're humble enough to say we don't know

616
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:17,920
everything and we probably will never know. I mean, why should we? That's also a totally irrational

617
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:22,560
idea that our brains are so constructed that we should know everything. I mean, a mouse might

618
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:25,760
think that if it could think that much, you'd think it knows everything, but it doesn't.

619
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:31,120
So, and we're evolving. There may be creatures in the future who think, what the hell did

620
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:38,480
homo sapiens in 2021 know? So, I just want to get back into the frame that not all the things

621
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:46,720
that matter to us, they are enormously important aspects of a universe that is not dead and static,

622
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:52,560
unless given a push, not without purpose, not without meaning, not without value. These things

623
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:58,560
are in the grain, in the warp and the weft of the cosmos. Of that I'm certain. And the job is

624
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:07,360
for us to find this. And most philosophers, wise people, sages, whatever you like to call them,

625
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:13,520
in the past, have adopted a view of the cosmos, which is exactly the one that one would expect

626
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:19,520
the right hemisphere to hold, which is one in which things are not always certain or known,

627
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:24,000
they're changing, they're interconnected, but the whole thing has a meaning. It is

628
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:31,760
not a heap of fragments that don't mean anything. The modern malaise. So, that's really where I'm

629
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:38,400
driving at, if you see, that's the philosophical goal, is to help people see something that I

630
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:44,480
think they already intuit. I mean, that was a response to the master and his emissary.

631
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:51,280
Apart from people enormously movingly writing to me, saying things I never thought I would ever

632
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:55,840
hear from writing a book, like your book changed my life, and I'm sure you've had this too.

633
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:03,120
But, you know, people saying, what you're saying, I kind of knew, I've known this, but I couldn't

634
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:08,080
find any way of articulating it. Well, there's a reason why you couldn't find a way of articulating

635
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:14,640
it, and that is articulation in language is controlled by the left hemisphere. It developed

636
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:18,800
very good tools for mapping out the world in a way that is very useful to its purposes.

637
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:25,520
But the important things are hard to articulate in words. They're implicit meanings,

638
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:32,560
all the deep things like love, religion, poetry, music. How do you say these in words? How do you

639
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:37,920
say them in language? But they have extraordinary meaning and power. They're the things we live for,

640
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:42,000
not for the things that we can say put down in a notebook, if you know what I mean.

641
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:50,000
So what's driven you in this direction, do you think? I mean, you made a very large number of

642
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:58,880
claims in that last section of thought. For example, you've come to the belief that value

643
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:04,320
is somehow implicit in the structure of being. That's what I understood what you said, and correct

644
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:10,880
me if I'm wrong, and that it's unfolding across time. I mean, I've been thinking about this

645
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:22,640
exact issue an awful lot. It's very difficult to formulate this question. So imagine that we're

646
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:29,840
drawn towards an ideal. Human beings are drawn towards an ideal. Imagine that you can detect

647
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:35,760
that draw by your own dissatisfaction, in part, is that you don't feel you're living properly,

648
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:39,840
or your conscience is bothering you. You feel that there's something more to be attained.

649
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:45,200
You're embarrassed at your insufficiencies, right? So there's this ideal that's pulling you onward

650
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:50,560
and judging you at the same time. And that ideal might be, well, the ideal human being,

651
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:55,280
that's one way of thinking about it. And that's partly why I got so interested in hero mythology.

652
01:08:55,280 --> 01:09:04,000
I mean, is it a reasonable conclusion of your line of thinking that the notion of the ideal

653
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:11,120
human being is somehow built into the structure of the cosmos? Because the class, I don't know how to...

654
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:15,440
No, it's not. No, I don't think that at all. I want to scotch that immediately.

655
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:19,680
Okay, well, how do you scotch that if you start with your presuppositions?

656
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:26,800
Well, because I don't... My presuppositions have nothing to do with an already conceived plan

657
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,800
that is just being acted out. This takes us back to the bad...

658
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,120
No, it wasn't applying. It wasn't necessarily...

659
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,640
Oh, all right. Well, okay. But let... All right. Okay. Well, I'm glad you weren't.

660
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:41,600
But a lot of people think that if I say these things, I must be positing an engineering god

661
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:46,000
who sort of tinkers with things and makes things happen according to his purpose.

662
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,320
Yeah, okay. That's fair. I mean, I was implying that in some sense. I mean,

663
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:55,280
I thought you might... I guess the question would be, where does your insistence that values are

664
01:09:55,280 --> 01:10:01,520
part of the structure of being? Like, where does that find its limit? Because the classic limit

665
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:09,600
of that is something like... In fact, the definition of the utmost place of value in some sense is

666
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:13,600
almost indistinguishable from the claim that there is a god. And so...

667
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:19,520
Well, a god is not the same as an engineering god. And I take enormous pains in the book.

668
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:24,240
It costs me more than anything I've ever written to write the chapter called The Sense of the Sacred,

669
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:32,240
in which I try to help people to a place where they can understand why people use this

670
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:38,240
extraordinarily difficult word, God. You know, it's not a satisfactory term,

671
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:44,400
but it's the term we have to have to name an aspect of our experience that if we don't name it,

672
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:50,000
disappears from our lives. And that's not to say that there isn't something there that is,

673
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:57,040
that merits whatever we mean when we say divine. I mean, we haven't defined what we mean by divine.

674
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:02,160
And we're back in the nets of language. We're trapped in the nets of language, as Shelling said.

675
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:10,240
But what I'm suggesting is that, as Whitehead suggested, and come on, Whitehead was also the

676
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:17,680
co-author with Russell of the Principia Mathematica. He wasn't a fantasist. He had this, I think,

677
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:27,040
incredibly deep idea that whatever one likes to call the divinity god, whatever, is the thing that

678
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:34,960
the cosmos has relation with. Relation is at the core of being. I even argue that relation is prior

679
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:40,000
to the relata, prior to the things that are related. That sounds nonsense. How can you relate,

680
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,400
how can you have a relation if there isn't anything yet to relate? But there's a wonderful image called,

681
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:51,760
in Indian mythology, called Indra's net, which covers the universe. And in it, the idea is that

682
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:58,160
the filaments of the net exist before the net, before the crossing points, which are the things

683
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:03,680
we see. And on those crossing points, there are little gems, which reflect every other gem in

684
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:08,560
the net. Now, that would take a very long time to unpack, but perhaps it can set things going

685
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:18,880
in people's minds. But the idea I have is that relation is prior to anything at all, really.

686
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:24,400
And that therefore, whatever you mean by god, and whatever we mean by the cosmos,

687
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:30,320
are in some sort of dynamic relation, which is an evolving one in which the outcome is

688
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:36,000
excitingly not known. If it were known, it would all be some horrible, possibly sadistic

689
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:44,880
play by an almighty, all-knowing god. I mean, look, I'm going to be talking to Rowan Williams

690
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:50,640
shortly, but I don't want to go into all that I mean by that. I don't think god is omniscient and

691
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:55,600
omnipotent, but I don't think he's not either. Just in the same way, I don't think he's green,

692
01:12:55,600 --> 01:13:00,480
and I don't think he's not green. I think the terms are wrong, but we can go there if we want,

693
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:08,240
and later or another day. But the thing, what I'm really saying is that God is discovering,

694
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:15,520
becoming unfulfilling whatever god is through the relationship, which classically in most

695
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:21,920
religions is described as love, which is after all just like a form of gravity in the world of

696
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:27,600
life and emotion rather than just in the world of the so-called inanimate.

697
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:37,040
So that therefore, we are coming into being, god is coming into being, and we're necessary to

698
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:40,880
one another's coming into being. It's not that god does a bit to us, and then we do a bit back

699
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:46,080
to god. It's like, I've read a very good book, I keep mentioning it by a young microbiologist

700
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:53,200
in America called Critishama called Interdependence, and she argues very importantly that it's not

701
01:13:53,200 --> 01:14:00,400
just that, certainly it's not just that an animal or an organism molds its environment,

702
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:04,240
nor is it just good enough to recognize that while an animal

703
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:11,040
affects and shapes its environment, the environment shapes the animal or the organism,

704
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:18,080
but that this is not a, you know, turn-by-turn process. It's not that the animal shapes the

705
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:23,440
environment, it should then, in its turn, shapes the animal. It's an entirely

706
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,200
simultaneous process of coming into being, of co-creation, if you like. Now this idea of

707
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:34,240
simultaneous coming into being is an ancient one, but I think it's a very deep one philosophically,

708
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:40,560
and a very important one. So that accounts for your objection to the idea of the omniscient determining

709
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:49,600
god? Absolutely, absolutely, because the god would have no creation. Creation is not really just

710
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:54,240
the unfolding of something that's already there. What's the name of the book? What's the name of

711
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:59,600
the book by the microbiologist? It's just called Interdependence. It's by Kriti Sharma.

712
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:10,480
Can you spell her last name? S-H-A-R-M-A. It's quite a short read. I'm mentioning her quite a lot

713
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:18,400
these days. Okay, so let me ask you a question. So now I'm going to try to pack up what you're

714
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:24,800
doing, and so again, tell me if I'm wrong. So we have these opposed viewpoints of the world,

715
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:31,520
paradoxical viewpoints. They're expressed, they make the hemispheric differences necessary, or

716
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:36,960
there are consequences of the hemispheric differences. If there wasn't a paradox, we wouldn't need the

717
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:42,720
two hemispheres. We need these two different ways of looking at things. We've tilted, we're in danger

718
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:50,080
of tilting too far to a left hemisphere view, and that's keeping us from, from what? It's keeping us

719
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:56,320
from apprehension of the relationship with the sacred that you're describing, the co-creation

720
01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:06,400
relationship. Is that, is that reasonable? Well, it's ruling out so much. I mean, I can't begin to

721
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:13,680
tell you, but you can imagine all the things that this very reduced abstract schematic bureaucratic,

722
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:20,400
essentially it's a bureaucratic, you know, you push something, it has an action on something else,

723
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:24,720
and you know, we can predict the outcome, we can organize it. That's the left hemisphere's vision

724
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:29,840
of the world, inanimate stuff that it can move about. Very much the Industrial Revolution was a

725
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:36,960
kind of acting out in the outer world of the world picture of the left hemisphere in some ways. I

726
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:43,920
talk about that more in the master and his emissary, but it's ruling out, it's ruling out, it's ruling

727
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:51,920
out everything really. It's ruling out our ability to understand, to see, to see at all. I mean,

728
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:58,160
a number of very important people, one of them Goethe said, you know, thinking is good, but seeing

729
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:03,920
is so much better. And I think we just don't see things anymore, because we don't expect them,

730
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:08,160
we don't understand them, we've ruled them out from the word go, because our world picture

731
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:13,920
just doesn't contain them. And if you stop doing that and start attending in a more flexible way,

732
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:20,800
you find there's a massively complex and fascinating, rich, nourishing response to your

733
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:26,960
attention. It's the absence of that that causes the meaning crisis, which is constantly being

734
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:31,600
bounded about. Well, the Egyptians, you know, the Egyptians knew that, the ancient Egyptians

735
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:41,520
knew that, because they, they, they, um, they're, the God Horus is the eye and its attention. And

736
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:48,720
it is Horus that revitalizes Osiris and he's the God of structure. And they saw the, the, the,

737
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:54,480
the proper sovereignty was a combination of attention and structure, a dynamic combination

738
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:59,600
of attention and structure. Well, this is absolutely brilliant. Well, I quite agree,

739
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:05,440
but this is where we come to, I need to make a correct, a possible misapprehension.

740
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:11,840
There is absolutely nothing wrong with the view of the right hemisphere. It's in fact necessary.

741
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:17,520
It's part of a, of a dialectic backwards and forwards between these two ways in which things

742
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:22,640
can be built. You can't have the one in a way without the other. You're quite right. We need

743
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:30,640
them both, but, but we live in an age which is completely obsessed with the idea of equality as

744
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:38,080
some eternal sort of truth about the cosmos. I have, I can see no evidence for this idea. It's a

745
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:44,960
lovely idea, a humanly invented idea, which is, which is a good one in society, although it can't

746
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:50,720
be realized and it may actually not be necessary or even good for it to be ultimately realized.

747
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:57,120
It might lead to a horrible kind of totalitarianism, as many 20th century philosophers pointed out, but,

748
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:01,760
but these two things don't have to be. That's the problem with elevating one virtue above all

749
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:07,600
else. It's a left hemisphere problem. Exactly. Well, it's an ideological problem. No, well, no, the

750
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:13,680
point is this. We need the left and the right, but we need the right to be in control. Now,

751
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:17,600
this is very important. This is the image of the master and his emissary, the emissary and the

752
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:22,960
master are not equal. The master needs the emissary and knows he needs the emissary. The emissary

753
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:29,600
being inferior doesn't know that he needs the master. So the emissary is good as long as he's

754
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:35,520
under the control of the master. Now, that image is extraordinarily important for understanding

755
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:46,080
this picture of the cosmos. And it's actually present in ancient Chinese, Navajo, not Navajo,

756
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:54,800
Iroquois, mythologies and so on, this idea of the being an unequal pair, that one has to be the

757
01:19:54,800 --> 01:20:01,600
guardian of the other. And as long as the one that is, as it were, a potential problem remains

758
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:07,760
under the supervision of the wiser one that sees all everything works well for everybody. And that's

759
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:13,280
why in the master and his emissary, I suggest with three periods in the West, in early Greek

760
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:17,920
civilization, in the peak of Roman civilization, and again at the Renaissance in the West,

761
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:23,280
where these were working well together. But in every case, it slid further to the viewpoint of

762
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:28,160
the left hemisphere. And in every case, the civilization has crumbled. And I see the evidence

763
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:35,600
for that all around me now. So I'm not saying that we just need these two things. I'm saying we

764
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:41,520
definitely need them both. Neither of them is bad. But what is bad is for the

765
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:48,160
the inferior one, the one that sees less to take control. And it's very easy for it to take control

766
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:53,200
because like the less intelligent person that thinks it knows everything, he thinks I've got it,

767
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:57,440
I've understood it. There's no more, you know, we do three more experiments and we've cracked

768
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:02,480
the universe, you know, it's all just a matter of, you know, a few years of science and we'll

769
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:10,160
understand that. Let me let you in on some of the things I've been grappling with here. So

770
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:17,680
I talked, I talked to Matt Ridley and Bjorn Lauburg recently, and their enthusiastic

771
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:25,120
Enlightenment rationalists, I would say there, they look at what's happened as a consequence of

772
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:29,200
the Industrial Revolution and the tremendous technological advances that that's produced

773
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:35,200
and the immense increase in human well-being. And they say we can continue with that into the

774
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:41,200
future. We can produce a world and perhaps are already producing a world where poverty is

775
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:45,440
increasingly going to be a thing of the past. And we can bring the rest of the world up to the

776
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:50,960
standards of living that characterize the West and and we can continue to expand the pie. And

777
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:57,280
I'm not interested in discussing whether that's possible or not, because it's possibly possible

778
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:03,920
and possibly not. But it's a particular vision, right? It's a vision of the extension of material

779
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:10,320
comfort to everyone. And that comfort has been extended tremendously over the last two or 300

780
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:15,040
years. It's absolutely amazing. And I would say in large part, it's a consequence of that left

781
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:21,840
hemisphere reduction of the world to manageable bits and the manipulation of it. And this is

782
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:27,120
not to say anything negative about your thesis whatsoever. But one of the things I've noticed

783
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:33,360
is that that materialistic utopian vision, and I'm also not insulting Ridley or Lambert, who I

784
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:38,880
admire greatly, that materialistic vision of incremental material progress has very little

785
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:47,360
motive power. It isn't an exciting story for some reason. What do we want? Incremental

786
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:54,000
improvement. When do we want it? In due time. It's not a gripping story. It's lacking something. And

787
01:22:54,960 --> 01:23:02,960
you seem to be pushing towards something that might be the medication for that lack.

788
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:10,960
There's nothing in that vision that speaks of a grand destiny for the individual, for society.

789
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:17,520
And there are many religious traditions that insist that human beings exist in a relationship

790
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:24,640
with the divine, and that it's only in living out that relationship that life is imbued with

791
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:31,200
the proper kind of meaning. And proper means sufficient to keep you from malevolence, I suppose,

792
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:37,120
and sufficient to be in love with life. Now, you posited in some of your statements a while back

793
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:45,520
that we're in this co-creation relationship with the divine. And that isn't too far off from my

794
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:53,040
understanding of many classical religious propositions that human beings participate in the

795
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:58,080
act of creation. Whether we participate in the act of creating God is a whole different question,

796
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:08,800
but we can leave that aside. So then the question is, what's the question that arises out of that?

797
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:16,480
I'm still trying to drive down at exactly what the main point you're making. You've worked on

798
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:22,480
this book for a tremendous amount of time. Something's driving you hard. And it's the revelation of a

799
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:28,400
solution to a very important problem. And the revelation seems to be something like an attempt

800
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:38,000
to explicate a higher-order vision, something that we can aspire to. And

801
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:45,520
the drive to this is that I don't think that we live in an enlightened

802
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:53,440
era. We live in what David Bohm called an endarkened era, in which what we think is enlightening us is

803
01:24:53,440 --> 01:25:01,520
in fact inducing misery. The strange thing is that, unarguably, when people are enormously

804
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:08,800
poverty-stricken, and of course one needs then to define what poverty is, are people who lead

805
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:16,640
the lives that their ancestors have lived as hunter-gatherers. Are they poor? Or do they only

806
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:21,600
become poor when their whole world is ripped apart and they're brought into the nearest large

807
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:27,440
industrial slum and have no bearings on the life, no relationship with the world, no pride,

808
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:31,600
and their health suffers and they kill themselves. So what is poverty? That is a very

809
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:37,840
important question first. But also remedying poverty, extreme poverty, is of course enormously

810
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:47,600
important. No feeling person could argue against that. But it's not enough. One rather well-known

811
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:54,640
historical figure said, man cannot live by bread alone. And the thing is that there's only bread

812
01:25:54,640 --> 01:26:02,240
in this story. But that leaves out everything. Peter Cook, he plays the part of a publisher who

813
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:10,240
says, the trouble with your book is that it lacks everything. And I feel that this kind of philosophy

814
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:15,120
lacks absolutely everything. It's got nothing whatever to offer. Now let me just put some

815
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:21,040
facts to this because it may sound, you know, it's just my opinion. What do we know? Well,

816
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:27,680
fortunately, going back to the 30s, school children in America in a certain system have

817
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:35,520
been asked the same questions about their happiness in life at the same age, going back now 70 years.

818
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:43,120
And Gene Twenge, who has looked at this data, which avoids all sorts of problems of defining

819
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:49,600
what you mean by happy and, you know, retrospector scopes and all the rest, you've got the data from

820
01:26:49,600 --> 01:27:01,680
the 1930s, the 40s, the 50s. And nowadays, the numbers of children that would qualify by a very

821
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:10,320
well authenticated and commonly used standard as being depressed is five to eight times what it was

822
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:18,480
in the 1930s when poverty was a big issue. So five or eight times, not five or eight percent more.

823
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:23,840
So there's something horrendous we're doing to ourselves. Suicide rates are going up,

824
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:29,200
particularly among women who register much greater dissatisfaction with life now than

825
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:35,040
they did 20 years ago, interestingly, because one might think that a number of things that

826
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:39,920
would have made life hard for them have been removed. But it just shows how complicated it is

827
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:46,320
knowing what works well for people. And three things overall, three things seem to be incredibly

828
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:52,640
important for human fulfillment and happiness. And one of them I touched on at the end of the

829
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:59,040
master and his emissary, which is feeling socially connected, being bound into a meaningful community

830
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:07,280
of trust. That's one. The second is being in the presence of nature. Just going off for half an

831
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:13,280
hour into a forest and being quiet has an effect on your blood pressure, on your physical health,

832
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:17,520
and so on. And these effects, if practiced, are greater than those in going to the gym.

833
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:24,560
And the thing that really struck me is there in Oxford, there is the Oxford Handbook of Religion,

834
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:31,360
I think it's called, but it looks at enormous bodies of evidence about the well-being of people who

835
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:38,320
are adherents to a religion and those who are not. And not only, as you very well might expect,

836
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:46,080
the people who are not adherents to religion, much more prone to anxiety, depression, drug

837
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:53,040
addiction, they cope less well with crisis, they're more vulnerable generally. But

838
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:59,520
they're actually physically not so well. So for example, rates of stroke, of heart disease,

839
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:07,120
are comparably better amongst the believing group than the unbelieving group,

840
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:13,520
with the difference between those who do cardio exercise for several hours a day.

841
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:20,640
And even smoking, it's a more powerful effect than smoking. Social connectedness is more

842
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:25,040
powerful than smoking. Being in nature, I think, is more powerful than smoking. And

843
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:35,600
being a part of a religious community that worships and even holding spiritual or religious views,

844
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:43,440
to some extent, is a mitigator against unhappiness and illness. So is that any answer to your question

845
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:50,240
of why, you know, why I don't think that Matt Ridley's idea of it's totally left-handed idea,

846
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:55,440
we just sort of crank out some more government departments, do some marvelous technical things

847
01:29:55,440 --> 01:30:00,640
and everybody gets to be living in a fantasy land of happiness. I don't believe this.

848
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:04,960
Well, I don't think he believes that. I mean, he's a complicated person and

849
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:12,240
he's more concerned with applying material resources where they could be most effectively

850
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:18,800
applied. I think the question of what material comfort and plenitude needs to be embedded in

851
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:23,600
is a different question. I think it's reasonable to say, well, we should do what we can to alleviate

852
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:31,600
destitution and catastrophic poverty. We should improve child nutrition. We should eradicate

853
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:38,080
tuberculosis. Obviously, right. The question is, what does that have to be nested inside for it to

854
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:46,720
be worthwhile? And so that's what you're aiming at. And I believe, what does that need to be

855
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:51,360
nested in to make it worthwhile? And you've come to this conclusion, was this a shock to you over

856
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:58,240
the years that you came to the conclusion that, okay, why not? I mean, the reason I'm asking is because

857
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:06,160
it isn't an everyday occurrence, in some sense, for a committed scientist to point out that

858
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:13,760
the scientific viewpoint needs to be embedded inside a broader, what, value oriented viewpoint?

859
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:18,160
It's something I believe, but it isn't an everyday occurrence for that to be stated forthrightly. And

860
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:23,600
as a scientist, it isn't necessarily the first thing that would come to mind. Like, have you always

861
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:29,760
thought this way or have you come to this as a consequence of your thinking? Well, I have the

862
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:37,520
advantage of having come to science from a fairly thorough grounding in the humanities. So I had a

863
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:47,040
philosophy of life that was based on reading, thinking, talking. And I was a relatively

864
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:55,280
aged customer when I started to study medicine, compared with most people who do that,

865
01:31:56,240 --> 01:32:04,720
at least in this country. So I brought a background which has always been my passion,

866
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:12,640
an interest in philosophy, but not just a kind of forever analytic philosophy in which you

867
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:18,000
is more or less like sort of angels dancing on a pinhead and breaking everything down to

868
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:23,120
the tiniest parts. This doesn't really particularly interest me, but a kind of more human philosophy

869
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:30,800
which doesn't become theology, but which is open to the idea that there is more

870
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:38,240
in the world than we can know or understand. But it does sound like it is, that it has become

871
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:44,160
theology. This isn't a critique. Like, it's an attempt to observe what you're telling me. It's

872
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:51,520
not a critique at all. I'm trying to understand this. Well, it depends what you mean by theology.

873
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:57,520
I don't think the most important part of a relationship with God is necessarily theology.

874
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:07,280
I'm not disrespectful of theology, but I've read a lot of, for example,

875
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:15,840
the Kabbalah. I've acquainted myself with Buddhist philosophy and I've always been very interested

876
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:23,600
in Taoism, Hinduism, and the deep wisdom of these things, including, as I say,

877
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:30,960
North American native people and even circumpolar people. I mean, the wisdom is embodied in their

878
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:38,000
mythologies. We think of these as somehow childish myths, but in fact, these myths contain, and in

879
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:42,720
fact, are the only way of containing or not containing because they're not ever contained,

880
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:51,200
but of transmitting, bringing into being for other people the things that are the deep truths.

881
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:58,480
And it's that that motivated me. I'm not going to be alive much longer. I mean, I'm not in

882
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:05,040
imminent danger of dying, but I mean, we're all actually here for an extraordinarily short time,

883
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:09,440
and there was great wisdom in the past in having a memento mori on your desk, a skull.

884
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:17,040
And we're not here for very long. And it behaves us to behave and to understand the world in the

885
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:22,000
most fruitful way for human fulfillment and happiness and for the greater fulfillment

886
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:28,800
of whatever it is that we sense in whatever is around us, in the being of the world. And,

887
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:34,400
you know, the word cosmos keeps coming to mind, which also in its root means beautiful, because I

888
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:40,080
think what one sees when one looks at the natural order is that it is as scientists and

889
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:45,920
mathematicians are constantly saying it's outstandingly beautiful, complex and orderly.

890
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:52,240
Why? Where does that come from? Well, I don't pretend to have an answer, but I see the difference

891
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:58,000
is between people who think they know the answer and people who don't. I'm one of the people who

892
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:03,120
don't think they know the answer. So please don't ask me what the answer is. I think I would disqualify

893
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:08,800
myself from having anything worthwhile to say if I thought I had the answer. The difference in life

894
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:19,040
is not between atheists on the one hand and believers on the other, but it's between fundamentalist

895
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:25,040
believers and fundamentalist atheists on the one hand and people who often call themselves honest

896
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:29,840
diagnostics on the other. That openness of mind, that willingness to acknowledge that one doesn't

897
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:34,640
know everything, that one's reaching and searching for something is far more fruitful and spiritual

898
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:38,560
to me than saying I know it, it's written down in this book and these are the rules.

899
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:48,160
The, I want to go back to the, I listen to all of that and I want to go back to the

900
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:57,120
this co-creation idea, because that's not a trivial idea. That's an overwhelmingly

901
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:07,680
massive idea. And it, see, I've, the audience, I've talked, the audiences I've talked with,

902
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:18,960
I've talked about the necessity of a vision of life that's sufficiently demanding, meaningful

903
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:29,360
to justify the trouble of existence. And you, it seems to me that it's necessary psychologically

904
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:37,440
to be in pursuit of a noble goal. And there isn't a goal that's more noble than the one that you

905
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:47,920
outlined virtually by definition, right? I mean, if, if you're co-creating the cosmos, but also

906
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:55,200
if you're in a co-creating relationship with God, that involves you at the highest level of being,

907
01:36:55,200 --> 01:37:08,160
with the structure of being. Well, I, you know, again, because we're talking

908
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:15,360
inevitably in shorthand because this is why this book is so colossally long. I mean,

909
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:25,360
it's apparently as long as the Bible. The reason I had to do that is that I'm, what I'm doing is,

910
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:31,440
is nothing less than this. I'm saying the whole way in which you are taught by your education,

911
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:39,840
by science, popular science, not by, you know, quantum physicists who have a very much more

912
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:46,080
sophisticated grasp of philosophy, but by the sort of 19th century mechanism who still dominate

913
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:55,120
biology unhappily, a version of some engineering, if you ever like. This is not a good way to think.

914
01:37:55,120 --> 01:38:05,520
This is not even likely to be true. It doesn't answer to any aspect of experience of the world,

915
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:11,600
except the most tinnily detailed. So for example, what I think is that the whole structure of things

916
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:17,760
is infinitely complex and has many recurring loops in it. And when you try, and it just an organism

917
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:25,280
is like that, or even a cell, or even, you know, part of a cell, an organelle, is amazingly complex

918
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:30,720
that the number of interactions, the number of chemical reactions that are going on there is

919
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:38,160
colossal and they all have cascades that interact with one another. However, if you take from this

920
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:44,480
very large picture right down to the tiniest, tiniest bit of light, you can see a little chain of

921
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:48,960
arrows. This leads to that, leads to that. You can't see that all kinds of other things going on.

922
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:54,000
And you can identify that. And that's what we're good at doing. And we say, if I interfere in that,

923
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:59,840
I can cause something to happen, which might be beneficial, for example, to somebody who has a

924
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:06,240
health condition. So I'm not saying there's anything wrong with any of this. Again, I come back to

925
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:10,480
there's nothing wrong with the left hemisphere. There's only something wrong with it when it

926
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:18,480
adopts the hubristic cloak of knowing everything. And when you said scientists are not often heard to

927
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:25,920
voice the sort of things that I'm saying and that you are saying, I'd like to say that physicists

928
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:32,880
very often do, but that biologists relatively less often do now, although in the early part

929
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:39,920
of the century, there were many great biologists such as J.B.S. Haldane, his father, John Scott Haldane,

930
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:48,880
Conrad Havre, Wollington, Ludwig von Vettelansi in Austria, who saw a very sophisticated vision

931
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:54,000
of the living world of biology. But what happened was, because there were great

932
01:39:55,040 --> 01:40:02,160
successes in molecular engineering after the war, this vision, which as I say is technically

933
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:07,360
correct, that you can interfere as a detail and do something very valuable. But the mistake is to

934
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:12,720
extrapolate from that, to say this is the structure of the whole thing we're looking at. It's not,

935
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:18,480
it's not like that. The least eight or nine ways in which an living being is not like a machine.

936
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:24,720
So I am sorry that scientists diminish themselves by adopting this very narrow vision

937
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:29,760
of what life is. Because after all, the whole point of science as Schrodinger said

938
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:33,760
is to answer the question, who are we? And if it's not answering that question, and it's not

939
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:40,320
assumable into an answer to that question, it's not really getting us to what the meaning of our

940
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:46,160
life demands from us. That we have not an answer to the question, who are we? Not an answer to the

941
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:51,520
question, what is the meaning of life? Of course, by definition, there isn't one. But the very knowledge

942
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:57,840
that we have to strive for it and not lose sight of it is very, very important. There's a saying in

943
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:05,040
the Midrash, you are, you're not obliged to finish the work, but you are not permitted to cease from

944
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:11,200
it. And I think that is, I mean, I would say that is my vision of what I do. I think it's what all

945
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:17,520
seekers after truth have to do, whether they're philosophers or scientists. And you know, I

946
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:24,880
would love science to be more scientific. The curious thing is I honor science deeply. And I

947
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:31,680
think that it has nothing to lose by making, you know, being a little bit humbler than it is by

948
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:37,360
accepting that there was a lot that is deeply puzzling and that the more we know about physics,

949
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:42,880
for example, the more we understand what we don't know. And it's not scientific to rule out certain

950
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:49,920
ways of thinking to say that thinking in terms of organic holes in terms of gestalt, gestalt and so

951
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:55,920
forth is somehow not scientific. No, it's just not the way that a certain very narrow form of

952
01:41:55,920 --> 01:42:02,800
sciences practice. And I want science before I die to become more open as science should be,

953
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:08,560
to be more questing, more imaginative. You know, in writing this book, I've had a lot to do with

954
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:14,640
the story of how scientists made their discoveries, how mathematicians made their discoveries. And

955
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:19,200
they very rarely, if ever, as George Gaylord Simpson himself said, you know, one of the great

956
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:26,080
mainstream molecular biologists of the last century, it's very rare that they make them by

957
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:30,800
following the scientific method. The scientific method is a retrospective thing that is fitted

958
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:37,600
on to what actually happens, which is extraordinary insights of intuition, seeing shapes, testing

959
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:43,440
them out, of course, which is a scientific method, of course. But it's not this kind of boring,

960
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,960
rule-bound thing that it's often made out to be.

961
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:53,360
Well, I think with that statement, that's a good place to end for today.

962
01:42:55,200 --> 01:43:02,720
It was a nice conclusion, gone for an hour and a half or so. And I appreciate...

963
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:03,360
It's all right with me.

964
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:09,840
Very much you talking with me. Hopefully we can do this again. I want to get further through your

965
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:16,400
book. I'll keep everybody posted as to the progress of the book and to where they can obtain it

966
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:22,160
when that becomes possible. Is there anything else that you wanted to mention today

967
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:25,360
that you want to bring up before we close?

968
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:32,640
Well, no. I mean, I want to say first of all, which I haven't really had an opportunity to say,

969
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:40,080
how enormously glad I am that you are back in debate with us all. And long may that be.

970
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:47,760
And I do... I think the conversations we have are good. I hope other people may think that too.

971
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:51,120
Well, we're going to put that to the test.

972
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:57,680
And I'd like to just draw people's attention to the fact that in the last six months,

973
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:03,600
it is six months, I think, six or seven months, we've developed something called Channel McGilchrist,

974
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:09,280
which is a place on the internet where you can find out more about my stuff. You can see

975
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:17,200
talks, lectures, podcasts, things I've done, what I'm... And generally keep up to date. There's a

976
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:22,960
forum there where you can enter into and discuss my work. There's a place where you can ask questions

977
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:29,680
off me. So once a month, I answer four questions out of a list of things that members of the...

978
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:33,200
Because you can either be a non-member or a member. But if you're a member, you can ask me

979
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:39,360
a question, which I will then spend a quarter of an hour answering. So that's my attempt to try and

980
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:44,640
give back something that isn't just the odd book every 10 years. So...

981
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,760
Well, we'll make sure that we put the links and all of that in the description of this video.

982
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:54,960
And with any luck, we'll get a chance to talk again in the future after we've both digested this

983
01:44:55,760 --> 01:45:01,360
and this conversation. It was really good to see you again.

984
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:04,960
Oh, and you. Thank you.
