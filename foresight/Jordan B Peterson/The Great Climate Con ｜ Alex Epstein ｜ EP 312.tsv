0	6420	It's the Hebrews created history as we know it.
6420	10500	You don't get away with anything and so you might think you can bend the fabric of reality
10500	14500	and that you can treat people instrumentally and that you can bow to the tyrant and violate
14500	16120	your conscience without cost.
16120	17420	You will pay the piper.
17420	22100	It's going to call you out of that slavery into freedom even if that pulls you into the
22100	23100	desert.
24100	30700	And we're going to see that there's something else going on here that is far more cosmic
30700	33180	and deeper than what you can imagine.
33180	41460	The highest ethical spirit to which we're beholden is presented precisely as that spirit
41460	45940	that allies itself with the cause of freedom against tyranny.
45940	46940	Yes, exactly.
46940	48460	I want villains to get punished.
48460	52140	But do you want the villains to learn before they have to pay the ultimate price?
52140	54500	That's such a Christian question.
65000	69620	You're optimizing for minimal impact and I think that is really the core of the modern
69620	70620	environmental movement.
70620	75420	It's not this just blanket collective desire for as much life as possible and we're somehow
75420	76740	getting in the way of that.
76740	78220	It's specifically against us.
78300	79660	They discovered the greenhouse effect.
79660	86540	They said this is going to on its own make the earth a much more lush place.
86540	89700	They speculated like the fruits are going to be bigger and everything is going to be
89700	94220	lush because we're going to have more farmland and more biological and it's kind of obvious.
94220	100060	If you have a warmer world with more CO2, it's a more tropical world with more life.
100060	104380	It's a more green world in the life sense of green and yet the green movement hates
104380	106540	it because we caused it.
106540	112340	They can see no good in anything we caused even when it leads to more biological productivity.
112340	119140	It's fundamentally an anti-human movement, not a pro-life of any kind movement.
119140	125740	The ineluctable conclusion that has to be drawn from that proposition is that any human
125740	132340	activity whatsoever is to be regarded as evil even if it increases total biological flourishing
132340	139380	in terms of let's say the net metric tonnage of biological life on the planet.
139380	144180	So that's also perverse because that is definitely a game that none of us can win.
144180	150820	If the a prior rule is no matter what you do, you're evil, then the only solution to that
150820	166700	is well how about a hell of a lot fewer of you.
166700	172420	Hello everyone watching and listening on YouTube or the associated podcast platforms.
172420	175220	I have with me today Alex Epstein.
175220	177420	I'm looking forward to this discussion.
177420	183680	He's a philosopher and energy expert who argues that human flourishing should be the guiding
183680	189740	principle and the appropriate metric for our energy and environmental policy and our determination
189740	191060	of its progress.
191060	197700	He's the author of the new book, Fossil Future, as well as the New York Times bestseller,
197700	201540	The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels, which was published in 2014.
201540	207980	He's also the creator of energytalkingpoints.com, a source of powerful, well-referenced talking
207980	212020	points on energy, environmental, and climate issues.
212020	218220	Epstein began his work in 2011 with the founding of the Center for Industrial Progress, a for-profit
218220	223300	think tank offering insights into the world of fossil fuels and fighting back against
223300	228660	the mainstream narrative of so-called environmentalism.
228660	233620	Only recognized as a master of persuasion and debate on energy issues, Alex has spoken
233620	239220	to dozens of Fortune 500 companies and at dozens of prominent universities, including
239220	243980	Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and Duke, his alma mater.
243980	249420	He's also a highly sought-after consultant on messaging, working with dozens of major
249420	254500	political offices on pro-energy, pro-freedom messaging.
254500	261740	We're here today to talk about the moral necessity of an energy-rich future, one that
261740	269020	both must and should rely on the abundant provision of the petro-based fuels so carelessly currently
269020	270540	demonized.
270540	278180	So welcome to all of you who are watching or listening, and welcome to Alex.
278180	282380	So maybe we could just start by having you walk through the book.
282380	288620	One of the things I found interesting to begin with was your discussion of the motivations,
288620	294100	let's say, of some of the more radical people that are pushing what is purported to be a
294100	296180	pro-environment stance.
296180	304420	People like Paul Ehrlich, who clearly have an agenda that could be more accurately conceptualized
304420	311420	as anti-human, certainly anti-industrial, rather than pro-environment.
311420	316420	And I think that's something that's worthwhile alerting everyone too, especially given the
316420	321900	current state of energy price increase in Europe, let's say, and the consequences that's going
321900	324100	to have for the poor around the world.
324100	326100	Let's start with that, though.
326100	328520	You wrote this book in 2014.
328520	333340	Let's talk about why you wrote it and how you think your prognostications have fared
333340	336220	in what's almost an intervening decade.
336220	340520	Well, I think one thing that's relevant, I'm not sure if you know this, but there's a new
340520	345640	book, 2022, called Fossil Future, which is the successor or replacement to the moral
345640	347500	case for fossil fuels.
347500	352540	So I talk a bunch in that about how the moral case for fossil fuels has fared.
352540	357100	And I think in terms of a predictive book, it's not primarily a predictive book, but
357100	359340	it has been extremely accurate.
359340	363220	Because if you look at what people have said in the last eight or so years, the main
363220	367340	narratives have been, we're not going to need fossil fuels as much as we used to.
367340	371420	They're going to be rapidly replaced by solar and wind primarily.
371420	376420	And that climate impact, the climate impact of fossil fuels, is going to be increasingly
376420	377420	catastrophic.
377420	382780	So we're going to see more and more suffering and death from climate-related disasters.
382780	387540	And in the book, I talk about that's not going to happen because, one, fossil fuels
387540	392660	will remain uniquely cost-effective, particularly in a world that needs far more energy, which
392660	396380	is something that was not stressed in the past and is not stressed enough today.
396380	399220	People are starting to realize most of the world doesn't have enough energy.
399220	403980	So replacing fossil fuels is almost impossible, given that you're not talking about just replacing
403980	407220	it for the people who use it, but for the people who need it.
407220	412160	So I've been very vindicated on the continuing cost effectiveness of fossil fuels.
412160	416940	And then on the climate disaster point, we have documented that climate-related disaster
416940	422020	deaths are down 98% in the last 100 years, and they've continued to decline.
422380	427740	And the basic reason is because whatever impact we have on climate that is negative, it is
427740	433460	far outweighed by our ability to master climate, to neutralize all sorts of climate dangers.
433460	438740	And so we're much better off overall climate-wise than we were 50 years ago and certainly 100
438740	439740	years ago.
439740	444340	So with regards to, let's start with the second one there, the climate disaster.
444340	450020	So the biophilic types, and so those would be people like Erlich, they seem to make the
450020	456780	case that metrics that involve human flourishing or even human death aren't relevant, because
456780	462580	the primary issue is to restore the biosphere to something approximating what it hypothetically
462580	468260	was before there were human beings, which is a rather strange notion, all things considered.
468260	473980	And so they might object to the fact that you're using the mere decrease in number of
473980	480780	deaths associated with climate trouble with weather events as a metric, because the metric
480780	483740	should be something like the purity of the planet.
483740	488020	And so what do you think about that argument?
488020	492700	What metric should we be using to determine whether or not a climate emergency actually
492700	493700	exists?
493700	499420	Well, I definitely think we should be using a human flourishing metric, but in a broad
499420	503500	sense, the climate disaster deaths are not the only aspect of that, but they're a very
503500	504500	important aspect.
504500	507780	We can also see that damages are flat or down.
507780	510560	We can see that life overall is much better.
510560	515220	And actually our ability to preserve the most valuable parts of nature is better.
515220	519380	Generally when you're not dependent on the land and dependent on wood, dependent on your
519380	525020	local environment for your fuel and your wealthy, you can be much better at preserving the parts
525020	526260	of nature that you want to preserve.
526260	530820	If you look at places in Africa and Asia and even now Europe, because they're now energy
530820	534540	poor, like cutting down their forests, it's because they don't have better sources of
534540	535540	fuel.
535540	541140	So, but I would challenge the idea that Erlich is really using this.
541140	546460	I think you called it biophilic standard, because if you look at his public rhetoric,
546460	549380	he's always appealing to a human flourishing standard.
549380	551220	So how did Erlich become famous?
551220	556180	He became famous through the 1968 book, The Population Bomb, where he's telling human
556180	561220	beings not, hey, the planet is going to become more impacted and that's intrinsically bad.
561220	563100	He's saying you're all going to starve.
563100	568060	And his close colleague, Sean Holdren, who was Obama's chief science advisor, now he
568060	572060	predicted in the 80s that we'd have up to a billion climate related disaster deaths
572060	577060	from famine by 2020, which has come and gone and the world is better fed than ever.
577060	583380	So what I find is that people who I think internally, they don't really care about human
583380	588380	flourishing and they're really optimizing for eliminating our impact as much as possible,
588380	591820	but they appeal to human flourishing to win over converts.
591820	595780	Because if they really said the best possible earth is the one that would exist had we never
595780	601940	existed and our goal is to eliminate as much human impact as possible as an end in itself,
601940	604060	they would not win many converts.
604060	608860	Well, the lack of a red wave during the midterms leads to more reckless spending by a more
608860	612980	emboldened administration, higher taxes, deeper inflation.
612980	617500	If you're unsure how the next two years will unfold, talk to Birch Gold Group about protecting
617500	619380	your savings with gold.
619380	624820	Birch Gold makes it easy to convert your IRA or 401K into an IRA in precious metals so
624820	628660	you can own gold and silver in a tax-sheltered account.
628660	631420	Gold is the world's oldest, most proven form of currency.
631420	636100	When inflation soars and all other assets go sideways, gold is still there.
636100	640660	This month, you can get a free gold back with every $5,000 purchase when you convert an
640660	646980	existing IRA or 401K into a precious metals IRA with Birch Gold by December 22.
646980	650420	Just text Jordan to 98998.
650420	654500	Birch Gold will help you own gold and silver in a tax-sheltered account.
654500	658980	Text Jordan to 98998 to claim your free info kit on gold.
658980	661500	Then talk to one of their precious metals specialists.
661500	665980	With every purchase you make before December 22, you'll get a free gold back.
665980	669540	This is a great stocking stuffer just in time for Christmas.
669580	674300	Text Jordan to 98998 and protect yourself with gold today.
676460	681900	Okay, so the case that you're making in some sense is that the argument on the radical
681900	689620	pro-environmental side actually varies sometimes, so to speak, in secret or behind the scenes,
689620	691700	sort of voce, I suppose.
691700	693900	The argument is made that the planet would be better off.
693900	698580	It was returned to some natural and unspoiled condition.
698620	704100	But then public-facing, the arguments are essentially predicated on the argument that
704100	708460	if we don't do something drastic about, let's say, climate change, we're going to cause
708460	711580	a radical increase in actual human suffering.
711580	716820	Okay, so that all has to be straightened out conceptually before we, as a species, let's
716820	719380	say, can move forward intelligently on this front.
719380	724620	I think the most powerful point you made, however, and I think this is where the rubber
724620	730460	really hits the road in more modern times, is that even if you use the metrics that are
730460	735900	put forward by those who, let's say, oppose the continuing use of fossil fuel, so those
735900	742220	would be metrics associated with climate change remediation and environmental improvement,
742220	748260	the policies that are designed to drive energy costs upward do nothing at all that isn't
748260	752180	counterproductive by their own measurements.
752220	755420	So you pointed out, for example, and this is something that people really need to be
755420	762260	alerted to, is that because Europe has taken this absolutely foolish route to reliance
762260	770100	on wind and solar, which is intermittent at best, one of the things that's happening because
770100	775860	of the pressure on liquid natural gas supplies primarily is that there's a tremendous amount
775860	781620	of deforestation occurring in Europe at the moment because people have to turn to sources
781620	786300	of energy that are actually at hand so that they don't freeze in the dark in the middle
786300	787380	of the winter.
787380	791140	And so the thing that I find so appalling about what's happening on the environmental
791140	796820	front at the moment is that even by the metrics of the people who are pro-environmental, these
796820	801780	policies that are driving energy costs upward are utterly counterproductive.
801780	807820	And you know, humanprogress.org has a lovely graph showing the relationship between attention
807820	815020	paid to true medium to long-term environmental sustainability and overall wealth.
815020	820820	And what you see is that if you can get, as you make people wealthier, so as you remove
820820	828860	them from absolute poverty, their ability and willingness to attend to longer-term environmental
828860	831540	issue starts to increase rather than decreasing.
831540	835460	And so this has struck me for, I've known this for at least 10 years, that the best
835460	841820	pathway forward to a truly sustainable planet, even by the definitions of the environmentalists
841820	847100	themselves, is to drive energy costs downward to the point where we can remediate absolute
847100	855940	poverty so that people aren't driven to use up damaging and polluting immediately available
855940	859740	bioresources instead of turning to more efficient sources of energy.
859740	864340	And you are certainly making that case in the 2014 book, which as you pointed out, you've
864340	867300	updated.
867300	868840	So that's the critical issue, right?
868840	873860	Even by the metrics of the environmentalists themselves, the policies that we're presently
873860	880300	pursuing on the energy front are not only counterproductive environmentally, but they're driving poor people
880300	881300	into abject poverty.
881300	885180	We're going to see a lot of that in Europe.
885180	886840	I think it depends.
886840	893500	So I think if you take the quote environmentalists as having a kind of pro-human interest in
893500	898100	nature and pro-human interest in lack of pollution, this is true.
898100	903940	But my belief is that the core of it is the belief that human impact is inherently bad,
903940	908340	it's intrinsically immoral, and also the belief is it's inevitably self-destructive.
908340	913100	So nature is viewed as this God, that if we offend it through our impact, is going to
913100	914100	punish us.
914100	917660	And it really has this character where it's wrong, and doing the wrong thing is going
917660	919060	to destroy us.
919180	924420	And if you really think about it that way, all their policies make sense because their
924420	930300	policies are really aimed at making human life worse and ultimately reducing the human
930300	931300	population.
931300	932300	So it is true.
932300	934540	You can say, well, yeah, aren't you cutting down more trees?
934540	935900	Aren't you doing this?
935900	940620	But they would say, well, let's say we had cheap, free nuclear energy, which they've
940620	943940	actually commented on hypothetically when they thought fusion was possible.
943940	947460	I talk about this in moral case and in fossil future.
947460	950380	The leading environmentalist said this would be the worst thing ever.
950380	955100	A totally clean, cheap, abundant source of energy would be the worst thing ever because
955100	956980	of what we would do with it.
956980	961820	And one of the leaders called it giving an idiot child a machine gun.
961820	966620	And what they recognized is that energy is really our ability to do work, which means
966620	968540	our ability to impact the earth.
968540	971620	And when we use a lot of energy, we impact the earth a lot.
971620	976240	Now we impact it in a way that's beneficial to us, including we preserve the most valuable
976240	980120	parts of nature, and we give ourselves an ability to enjoy nature.
980120	983240	Nevertheless, it is a very humanized earth.
983240	987740	And to the anti-human environmental movement, that is offensive.
987740	991840	So that movement is not about a clean environment for us or for us to be able to contemplate
991840	995520	polar bears or go on safaris or any of this.
995520	997400	It's about a dehumanized earth.
997400	1001200	It's the belief that we are uniquely bad and we need to get eliminated.
1001200	1002200	Right, right.
1002440	1006760	But the problem with that argument, even if you attempt to give the devil his due, let's
1006760	1013640	say, is that it's predicated on the idea that if we pursued policies to decrease our overall
1013640	1020480	energy use, and if one of the consequences of those policies was the relatively radical
1020480	1028120	depopulation of the earth, perhaps by radically lowering birth rates, that while that transformation
1028120	1035000	was occurring, depopulation and deindustrialization, things would remain stable enough so that
1035000	1039480	in our new poverty and our hopelessness with regards to the future, we wouldn't be devouring
1039480	1041280	the planet while we were dying.
1041280	1043560	And I think that's a preposterous claim.
1043560	1050860	I don't see any peaceful way forward that's based on compulsion and poverty to reduce
1050860	1055280	the population of the world that isn't going to be absolutely destructive on the energy,
1055280	1059160	on the environment, on the environment front.
1059160	1064240	And the idea that if we had more energy, we would actually be worse for the planet, flies
1064240	1069040	in the face of what we've been discussing already, which is the fact that if people can't
1069040	1074640	turn to cheap and efficient and relatively clean sources of energy, and perhaps liquid
1074640	1080480	natural gas and nuclear would be at the top of that list, then they're going to absolutely
1080480	1086720	100% turn to much dirtier replacements, and we've already seen that happening in, well,
1086720	1087720	everywhere.
1087720	1092760	China is building coal-fired plants at a rate that's so rapid that everything the West
1092760	1097160	is doing on the climate amelioration front is absolutely irrelevant.
1097160	1102720	And what has the UK in the last week has already pledged to double its coal imports, and Germany
1102720	1108680	has had to turn to its coal-fired plants to provide backup power because wind and solar
1108800	1115000	has proved not only hyperexpensive, but so unreliable that, well, that when there's no
1115000	1119440	power, so when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing, you have to have backup,
1119440	1125720	and it's been coal that's been brought in as a stopgap.
1125720	1132000	So I just can't see any way, even if you accept the arguments that you just laid forward,
1132000	1135840	that there should be fewer people and that the right planet is one that's characterized
1135840	1142000	by minimal human action, I can't see any way forward to that on the energy poverty front
1142000	1145280	that's not going to be positively counterproductive.
1145280	1152080	I agree with you in terms of how it plays out, and I think it's important in general
1152080	1156560	this is not a scientific movement, and part of it not being a scientific movement is
1156560	1162400	it doesn't really have a long-term strategy for achieving its anti-human goals.
1163120	1169920	It has a lot of ritual in it, there's a lot of just hostility toward anything that has impact,
1169920	1173520	and you just oppose that, and then you assume things are going to get better.
1173520	1177760	And so people didn't think through what's going to happen when you make energy more expensive,
1177760	1180720	what's going to happen to the forest? They didn't think that through at all,
1180720	1185520	or when you oppose nuclear, what are you going to use in its stead? Or when you make energy
1185520	1189840	expensive, what's going to happen in terms of rights? It's not at all thought through,
1189840	1194000	and I think this might be a lesson for us to have when we contemplate these so-called plans
1194000	1199200	for net zero. This is a movement that's very much, it has this hostility toward human impact,
1199200	1204160	it opposes it wherever it sees it, and it just, it has a quality of nihilism to it.
1204160	1208080	And it's not thinking through, it's not thinking through either a dehumanized earth
1208080	1213680	or a human-friendly earth. It's sort of going after anything that has impact, but my argument is
1213680	1219040	we need to switch our hostility toward impact. This view that human impact is bad
1219040	1224560	needs to be challenged. Human impact is good if it makes the earth a better place for human flourishing.
1226080	1230400	The biggest banks and investment firms in the world are putting up to half of their total assets
1230400	1235920	into new investments. What do they know that we don't? Maybe that the economy is about to get
1235920	1242160	worse? The CEO of JP Morgan just warned that stocks could slide another 20%. Bigwigs are
1242160	1247280	moving their money into alternatives like fine art, because fine art has outpaced even the S&P
1247280	1255360	500 over the last 26 years by 131%. Even in 2022, Masterworks produced results. In early
1255360	1261360	November, Masterworks had a strategic exit for a 17.8% net return to their investors.
1261360	1267920	Their last three exits have brought in 17, 21, and 33% net returns. The next six months could

1297360	1303680	because one of the things I wonder about is why this idea that human beings are in some sense
1304240	1312880	in their activity antagonistic to the earth. It's a very peculiar metaphysical assumption,
1312880	1317920	especially for people who are hypothetically, biologically minded, because if we're living
1317920	1322960	creatures, which we clearly are, and if we've evolved in the same manner that other living
1322960	1328640	creatures have evolved, which seems relatively indisputable, then how is it that our very
1328640	1334240	existence is somehow antithetical to the flourishing of the biosphere, given that we're clearly part
1334240	1339440	of the biosphere? And you see this sort of thing with this idiot assumption, for example,
1340160	1345120	that bears some of the same hallmarks of this kind of quasi-philosophical thinking that
1345120	1350000	before the Europeans came to North America that the natives were living somehow in harmony with
1350000	1356080	nature, and that the entire biosphere was free of the scars of human interaction, and
1356080	1361760	that's utterly preposterous. I mean, the Native Americans were incredibly sophisticated agricultural
1361760	1369360	ists, and the Western Plains Indians burned the prairies with constantly to ensure that there
1369360	1375440	was a plentiful supply of the buffalo that they depended on. And so human beings have been
1376080	1381120	affecting the structure of the biosphere ever since we've been around, and that's for a very
1381120	1386640	long period of time. And the idea that there was somehow some pristine state of nature before
1386640	1392560	we emerged on the landscape, and that there's some moral imperative to return to that,
1393280	1397920	it strikes me, it's so incoherent that it's barely comprehensible. And there is something like a
1397920	1402720	hatred for humanity, as far as I can tell that's lurking underneath this, hatred for humanity,
1402720	1406880	certainly a hatred for industrialization. And those actually turn out to be the same thing.
1406880	1413520	I mean, one of the things that's really struck me as incomprehensible over the last few years is that,
1413520	1419920	especially on the left, is that you have these joint claims being put forward simultaneously
1419920	1425840	on the left, and one is that we're radically pro-environmental, and we're also the
1426800	1432480	philosophical doctrine that is standing up for the poor and oppressed. And I think, okay, well,
1432480	1437200	what happens when those two things are pitted against each other? And when are they pitted?
1437200	1442240	Well, they're pitted when it comes to discussions about cheap energy, because it's clearly the case,
1442240	1448800	and you outline this in your book quite nicely, that the most effective way of remediating absolute
1448800	1456000	poverty, so lifting people out of the privation that's associated, at least with lack of education,
1456000	1462960	but also with starvation itself, is to provide them with cheap energy, because as you pointed
1462960	1467120	out, there's no difference between energy and work, and there's no difference between work and
1467120	1473520	productivity. There's no difference between productivity and the eradication of poverty.
1473520	1479520	And so we are pursuing these expensive energy policies, and hypothetically, we're supposed
1479520	1485520	to benefit the planet, although we're not, but we are definitely dooming people who are already poor
1485520	1492240	to a much more truncated horizon of opportunity, and to absolute privation and starvation in many
1492240	1496960	cases. Yes, I think it's really... I mean, there are at least two really interesting issues raised
1496960	1502480	here, sort of this tension between the alleged concern for poverty and then the quote concern for
1502480	1508560	the environment, and then this question of how this bizarre view evolved, because this was not
1508560	1513200	the view of our environment and our impact 100 years ago. And interestingly, it's not the view
1513200	1517200	of our environment that anyone who lives near nature has. People who live in nature don't worship
1517200	1522880	nature as the superior God that can't be impacted. And I think it's my own understanding of the
1522880	1528960	history, and I really enjoy... There's a book by Einran called The New Left, The Anti-Industrial
1528960	1534080	Revolution, and it was written at the time that this was happening. And one of the analyses is
1534080	1538800	basically there's a transition between the old left and the new left, where the old left claimed
1538800	1544720	to be for industry, for productivity, for prosperity. And what happened is that was clearly
1544720	1549600	not achieved by their policies. Communism led to the devastation of industry, the malfunction of
1549600	1554880	industry, widespread poverty. And Einran said, well, the left basically had a choice. Are you
1554880	1560000	going to stay with your anti-capitalism, or are you going to embrace capitalism because you really
1560000	1565280	care about industry and productivity? And actually, what they did was they kept their
1565280	1570960	anti-capitalism, and they looked for new reasons to support anti-capitalism. And in the 60s,
1570960	1576240	they decided on this issue of environment. And it was a convenient issue in a number of ways.
1576240	1580960	One is the pro-capitalism side didn't do a very good job with it, particularly rhetorically.
1580960	1585360	They didn't make the point that, well, good environments are made possible by prosperity.
1585360	1591040	So the idea of a good environment in a humanistic way was co-opted by the anti-capitalist who had
1591040	1596560	no right to it whatsoever. I mean, look at the Soviet Union and an environment, but they owned
1596560	1603200	that value issue. But then they packaged it with this hostility toward human impact as such. And
1603200	1607840	what they really did brilliantly was they took over the schools. So in the schools, this idea
1607840	1613600	that human impact is bad, and especially the idea that it's inevitably self-destructive because the
1613600	1618880	planet is this delicate nurture that our impact ruins. And that has permeated the whole educational
1618880	1623600	system where people think that we inherently are destroyers of the planet, and it has permeated
1623600	1628880	the scientific community. What I call this delicate nurture dogma is unfortunately pervasive
1628880	1634480	in earth sciences today. It's a very primitive and bizarre view. It has nothing to do with reality
1634480	1639280	that our impact is inevitably self-destructive. Actually, our impact has made the earth much
1639280	1644160	better overall, including safer from climate. But nevertheless, I think it's really, there was
1644160	1649200	initially a real political motivation to spread this. But now we have this irrationalist philosophy
1649200	1653760	that has a mind of its own. Yeah, well, that's okay. So let's delve into that a little bit,
1653760	1658960	because the other thing that I've come to understand more clearly in the last 15 years,
1658960	1662160	let's say, as the data has also become more clear is that,
1664240	1669360	so we lifted more people out of poverty in absolute terms, and also in relative terms,
1669360	1676640	between 2000 and 2015, than we had lifted people out of poverty in the sum total of human endeavor
1676640	1685920	before that. And it's quite clear that the reason for that was that fewer countries pursued absolutely
1685920	1691360	counterproductive economic policies of the type that were put forward, let's say, by the
1691360	1697760	communists when the Cold War was raging. And so you saw all over the world, including in places like
1698880	1706720	Communist China, that there was a radical move towards something approximating free market and
1706720	1711120	free trade between individuals. And in some countries, that was implemented more effectively
1711120	1717280	than others. But wherever it was implemented, at least quasi effectively, people immediately
1717280	1724160	stopped starving. And so, and I'm trying to make a case in relationship to the anti-capitalism,
1724160	1730320	so let's say that you are a genuine classic leftist, and you are actually concerned with the poor,
1730320	1735280	especially remediation of absolute poverty, and you're looking at the data, and you see that
1735280	1741040	after the Soviet Union collapsed, and there were fewer countries turning to communist dogma to
1741200	1746400	formulate their economic policies, and more countries started to develop, started to participate
1746400	1752880	in the broad free market, that we drove poverty down to its lowest level in absolute numbers,
1752880	1757680	or in relative numbers, certainly, than we'd ever seen before in history. And so then again,
1757680	1766960	we're back to the same issue. If the spread of free market policies remediates absolute poverty,
1767040	1774640	which it clearly does, and in a staggeringly rapid manner, then what in the world is driving
1775200	1782000	the anti-capitalist ethos? You know, you said that there's this underlying metaphor of nature as
1782000	1788800	something like fragile virgin, right, continually what rendered susceptible to our raping and
1788800	1794960	pillaging. So there's a weird metaphor lurking at the bottom of all that, but given the overwhelming
1794960	1801920	data that something approximating free market frees people from absolute poverty, and then
1801920	1806720	conjoining that with the observation that richer people actually care more about the environment,
1806720	1811600	you're left again with this question of what in the world is motivating this. There's some deep
1811600	1817600	hatred. It's like a deep hatred for humanity itself, but even at the expense of the planet.
1817600	1823040	And so I still struggle with trying to comprehend that. There's a kind of existential guilt there
1823600	1827040	for the crime of existence itself. It's something like that.
1828000	1834640	I mean, I think there's one really powerful fact about the increase in prosperity that I draw
1834640	1838720	attention to a lot in fossil future, because I think it's very notable. So I point out, I was born
1838720	1844400	in 1980. Since 1980, we've gone from more than four in 10 people living on less than $2 a day,
1844400	1849040	and this is adjusted for inflation, to one in 10. So as you said, this is the greatest alleviation of
1849040	1854720	poverty in human history. Now, what's really interesting is if you survey, and this was done
1854720	1858800	in the UK, you might have seen this before, but there's a survey of college-educated adults in
1858800	1864640	the UK about what has happened to extreme poverty over the past 30 or 40 years. And this is just
1865200	1870880	an objective documented thing. There's no question. And so what happened is only 12% of people
1870880	1878880	thought it got better. 55% of people thought it got worse, and the rest thought it stayed
1878880	1884640	the same. And it just shows you the level of miseducation about this issue. And I do think
1884640	1889840	a lot of it is the modern anti-human environmental movement, because what they've done is they've
1889840	1894880	taught us that our impact ruins the planet. And so we just assume that because the world used
1894880	1900320	a lot more fossil fuels, particularly China and India did, which drove much of the increase
1900320	1905200	in prosperity, they just assume that the world is worse. And what I call, I don't use this term
1905200	1909840	in a moral case, but I use it in fossil future, our knowledge system. So the institutions we
1909840	1917680	rely on for expert knowledge and guidance, they've totally failed at educating us about how much
1917680	1922400	the world has improved from a human perspective. And this goes back to my argument that the
1922400	1927520	anti-human environmental movement, they're trying to pretend to be pro-human. So they don't want us
1927520	1931920	to know that the earth is a much better place than ever to live. They don't want us to know
1931920	1936160	that climate disaster deaths are way down. They don't want us to know about the decline in extreme
1936160	1941040	poverty, because it totally challenges their narrative that impact in general and fossil
1941040	1946560	fuels in particular are bad. And if we recognized how vital fossil fuels are, then we would be
1946560	1952160	really afraid of these proposals to get rid of fossil fuels in the next 27 years in a world
1952160	1956880	that needs far more energy. And unfortunately, we're starting to realize this involuntarily
1956880	1961760	because these policies just implemented one percent, these anti-fossil fuel policies,
1961760	1966160	just implemented to one percent success rate in the anti-fossil fuel movement's view
1966160	1971440	have already led to a global energy crisis. Do you have a coffee lover on your holiday

2030880	2039440	Right, right. Well, you knew said that the planet is getting better, let's say,
2039440	2044960	from a human perspective. And so we've looked at metrics like the radical decrease in absolute
2044960	2050800	privation. But we could turn our attention momentarily to the evidence that in many ways,
2050800	2055360	and somewhat paradoxically and perversely, the planet actually seems to be doing better
2055360	2062880	from the natural perspective too. Now, I have been concerned about, I have believed for a long
2062880	2068640	time that one of our focal concerns might be on the environmental front might appropriately be
2068640	2074560	something like remediation of misuse of oceanic resources, because I think we've done a pretty
2074560	2085040	cataclysmic job of protecting our, especially our coastal lands and the shelf environments
2085120	2089200	just off shore of the continents, where pretty much all the fish are. I think we've done a
2089200	2095760	catastrophic job of managing that. And there are genuine environmental problems that I think
2095760	2100320	sensible people should take into account. But, you know, I was looking at a graph this week,
2100320	2104400	and I've known about this phenomenon for quite a while, phenomenon for quite a while,
2105360	2113680	that again, in the last 15 years, a surface area totaling 15% of the entire planet has
2113680	2119280	greened. I mean, that is, that's an area that's larger than the continental United States,
2119280	2123360	and it's, so let's, let's walk through that for a minute, so just so everyone who's listening
2123360	2130400	is clear. In the last 15 years, the planet has not got less green, it's got more green, and not
2130400	2137920	only a little bit more green, stunningly more green, 15% in, essentially in 15 years, and that's an
2137920	2142160	area bigger than the continental United States, and that's happened pretty much everywhere in the
2142160	2147920	world. And then you might say, well, where is that happening? And perversely, and contrary to all
2147920	2153920	predictions, it's happening in the drier areas of the planet, especially in semi-arid areas,
2153920	2162080	and here's the reason. So plants have to breathe, and to breathe, they have to open pores on their
2162080	2168320	surface, and the problem for plants when they breathe with these pores is that they also allow
2168320	2174640	water to evaporate from their internal structures, and so the less carbon dioxide in the air, the
2174640	2179200	more the plants have to open their pores, and that means the more susceptible they are to drying out,
2179200	2184800	and that means that they struggle to exist in semi-arid areas. Now, what's happened as a consequence
2184800	2189680	of increased carbon dioxide production is that plants can breathe easier, and so they don't have
2189680	2195200	to open their pores to the same degree, and what's that, what that has meant is that the very desert
2195200	2201840	areas, at least the semi-arid areas, that the climate apocalypse were claiming would
2201840	2208160	expand and spread, so the desertification of the world, the exact opposite has happened,
2208160	2213200	and the Sahara Desert, for example, has shrunk to quite a stunning degree, and not only is the
2213200	2220400	planet 15% greener than it was in 2000, but there are more trees in the northern hemisphere
2220400	2227760	than there were a hundred years ago, and as well as the planet greening, and so you can think about
2227760	2233920	that as a victory on the objective front for the natural world, at the same time the planet is green,
2233920	2238400	because it's easier for plants to survive, our food crops have become much more productive
2239200	2244960	for exactly the same reasons, and so as carbon dioxide output has increased, the planet has got,
2244960	2250480	not only has the planet got greener, it's got greener in the driest areas, which is absolutely
2250480	2257600	stunning and remarkable, and one of the consequences of that increased greening is that our agriculture
2257600	2263200	production has become not less efficient, but much more efficient, and so I'm really wrestling with
2263200	2267840	how to conceptualize that particular sense of statistics. I just thought of an idea, I just
2267840	2271360	thought of an idea, I've never thought of this before, so we're just trying it right now, but I
2271680	2276160	think maybe we can think of three conceptions of the earth which capture everything we're talking
2276160	2281520	about, so my primary conception is evaluating the earth from the perspective of human flourishing,
2281520	2287040	how hospitable to human beings is it, and this includes like a lush green beautiful world for
2287040	2291920	us to enjoy for many reasons you've talked about, but then the second one could be looking at the
2291920	2298320	earth in terms of just pure biological productivity, so just not even focusing on humans, just how much
2298320	2304000	life is on the planet, and this captures what you just mentioned with rising CO2 levels,
2304000	2308800	making a greener planet, but then the third one, and I think this is really the core of the modern
2308800	2315440	environmental movement, is an unimpacted planet, so you're not optimizing for biological productivity,
2315440	2320240	you're optimizing for minimal impact, and I think that is really the core of the modern
2320240	2325440	environmental movement, it's not this just blanket collective desire for as much life as possible,
2325440	2329200	and we're somehow getting in the way of that, it's specifically against us, and I think you
2329200	2335280	brought up the perfect example, which is the climate catastrophe movements total non-interest
2335280	2342080	in kind of the obvious biological productivity benefits of more CO2, and this was not shocking
2342080	2346800	or stunning, this is exactly what was predicted by the people who discovered the greenhouse effect,
2346800	2351600	when they discovered the greenhouse effect they said this is going to on its own make the earth a
2351680	2358000	much more lush place, they speculated like the fruits are going to be bigger and everything
2358000	2362080	is going to be lush because we're going to have more farmland and more biological, and it's kind
2362080	2368560	of obvious, if you have a warmer world with more CO2, it's a more tropical world with more life,
2368560	2373600	it's a more green world in the life sense of green, and yet the green movement hates it
2373600	2379920	because we caused it, so they can see no good in anything we caused, even when it leads to more
2379920	2383600	biological productivity, so I think what you're bringing up really shows it's fundamentally an
2383600	2389760	anti-human movement, not a pro-life of any kind. Right, right, okay, but let's let's talk about
2389760	2397920	that idea of impact, it's like well what is this hypothetical perfect world that exists statically
2398560	2404880	that would be pristine and morally valuable in the absence of human beings, I mean the biosphere
2404880	2411360	is a dynamic place obviously over any timescale and there's shift in what constitutes quote the
2411360	2417360	environment, there seems to be this presumption that at some point in the past when there was
2417360	2424000	minimal human activity the earth was somehow optimized in the biological but also the moral
2424000	2430480	sense and that any change in that whatsoever in any direction, hence climate change let's say rather
2430480	2437280	than global warming, any change in that whatsoever is to be regarded axiomatically as evil, but what
2437280	2443440	that essentially means as far as I can tell the ineluctible conclusion that has to be drawn from
2443440	2450960	that proposition is that any human activity whatsoever is to be regarded as evil on the
2450960	2455920	face of it, it doesn't matter what it does, and your point is that even if it increases bio,
2456880	2461760	even if it increases total biological flourishing in terms of like let's say the
2461760	2468880	net metric tonnage of biological life on the planet and so that's also perverse because that is
2468880	2476320	definitely a game that none of us can win, if the a prior rule is no matter what you do you're evil
2476320	2482080	then the only solution to that is well how about a hell of a lot fewer of you, but then you say well
2482080	2487280	what's that supposed to serve because if what we're doing now is actually making the planet more
2487280	2492560	green and I'm saying that very carefully because I know that that's not a sufficient metric, I am
2492560	2499440	very concerned with issues let's say or conscious of issues that are relevant like the potential loss
2499440	2508560	of biodiversity and also the overfishing of the oceans let's say, so even though the planet is
2508560	2513440	becoming greener that doesn't mean that there are no mistakes we're making on the environmental
2513440	2518560	front, but those mistakes have to be differentiated out and they're all addressable and you know as
2518560	2523680	we get richer too and we can do more with less and our agriculture becomes more efficient if we can
2523680	2529520	manage that, that also means even by the standards of the environmentalists themselves that we'll
2529520	2537120	be able to set aside reasonably large tracts of land and water to maintain them in something
2537120	2542880	approximating a pristine and untouched state, I mean that's certainly something that should be done
2542880	2550720	on the on the oceanic management front, I mean the data that I know suggests that if we set aside
2550720	2556240	a certain percentage of the coastal area as marine protected areas and that might not be the most
2556240	2561760	efficient way to manage the oceans but it's not bad that we'll reap the benefits of having
2561840	2569360	untouched nature so to speak which is an aesthetic and economic and environmental good but we'll also
2570240	2574160	be able to replenish the oceans in a manner that would be economically productive and so
2574800	2579280	well like why can't why the hell can't we have our cake and eat it too that is we can help people
2579280	2586160	become rich with the provision of of plentiful energy and then we can put aside tracts of the
2586160	2591440	world so that they're relatively untouched so that biology can do its thing and like what the
2591440	2596560	hell is the problem with that precisely? Well it's it's so I think you're pointing to something
2596560	2601040	really good and something really bad something really good is why my my new book is called
2601040	2606480	fossil future why global human flourishing requires more oil coal and natural gas not less but part
2606480	2611600	of it it does talk about we can you know we can increase all of these biological things we can
2611600	2617120	have a much more lush world we can enjoy nature much more this is fundamentally good news the more
2617120	2623120	energy we have the more control we have over earth and the more we can make everything about it better
2623120	2629040	for our purposes including aesthetic things that poor people can't possibly be confused by but the
2629040	2635120	bad thing here is it's really highlighting the nihilism of this view that human impact is bad
2635120	2640960	and again I really think it's the view is not that we want a lush environment and human beings are
2640960	2644320	getting in the way of that we want biological productivity and human beings are getting away
2644320	2650160	because as you're pointing out they are opposing all human impact including obvious things that make
2650160	2655760	the world better and so it really is the view that if we did it it's bad and you ask something like
2655760	2661600	what is it serving but it's a nihilistic view so it's not really serving anything even when you
2661600	2666480	think when you think about unimpacted nature it's not this beautiful thing for us to enjoy
2666480	2671600	it's supposed to be protected from us so that's really the view including our enjoyment of this
2671600	2679040	evil of course our enjoyment is of no consequence whatsoever and in fossil future and in moral
2679040	2684000	case I have a lot of quotes from the leaders where they'll occasionally let this slip out where one
2684000	2688640	guy for example who was reviewing Bill McKibbin's book the end of nature talks about you know
2688640	2693280	like a flourishing biosphere is more important to me more important to me than one human or a
2693280	2698800	billion of them yeah yeah let me read that let me read that I've got it right here so this is
2698800	2704080	something that you cite in your 2014 book I'm gonna just read it so everybody can hear it and I would
2704800	2710720	I would ask everyone who's listening to really think about this because this gets to the this
2710720	2716880	strikes to the core of the issue as far as I can tell so for example this is from your book
2717440	2721360	in a Los Angeles Times review of the end of nature
2723040	2728000	McKibbin's influential book of 25 years ago predicting catastrophic climate change
2728880	2735680	David M. Graber research biologist for the National Park Service wrote this summary of
2735680	2746800	McKibbin's message McKibbin is a biocentrist and so am I we are not interested in the utility
2746960	2755760	of a particular species or free flowing river or ecosystem to mankind they have intrinsic value
2756320	2762320	more value to me than another human being that's a very interesting thing to say
2762320	2767120	or a billion of them which is also a very interesting thing to say human happiness and
2767120	2774000	certainly human fecundity are not as important as a wild and healthy planet
2774960	2783040	are no social scientists who remind me that people are part of nature but that isn't true
2784960	2791760	somewhere along the line at about a billion years ago maybe half that we quit the contract
2792960	2798400	and became a cancer we have become a plague upon ourselves and upon the earth
2798720	2805840	it is cosmically unlikely that the developed world will choose to end its orgy of fossil fuel
2805840	2813520	consumption and the third world its suicidal consumption of landscape until such time as
2813520	2823520	Homo sapiens should decide to rejoin nature some of us can only hope for the right virus
2824480	2829760	to come along you know I cannot understand how anybody who is
2833200	2839600	positively predisposed to children let's might we might say could read something like that
2839600	2845920	and not be absolutely shocked to their core I mean so let's walk through the claims the first claim is
2846240	2855040	a an untouched natural landscape of any size whatever untouched means is more valuable in
2855040	2861520	and of itself than any individual human being or any group of people no matter how large the number
2862480	2870080	okay so the implication there is any number of human beings could be sacrificed in order to preserve
2870640	2878960	any geographically demarcated natural zone of any size so that's a yes a standard of comparative
2878960	2888640	value and then the cancer metaphor while human beings have deviated from the natural order whatever
2888640	2894080	that natural order is whatever our deviation consists of and we've deviated the same way
2894720	2902160	a cancer deviates so now the metaphor is human beings equal cancer and that's that's a hell of a
2902160	2909120	metaphor because what we do with cancer is strive to eradicate it so these metaphors have deep
2909120	2914560	motivational significance so that's a little bit on the appalling side let's say and it's grounded in
2914560	2920720	a very narrow malethusian view of the world which is that we're something like yeast cancer let's say
2920800	2925840	and left to our own devices will multiply unchecked until we devour everything in perish
2925840	2933280	which is a pretty dismal and only vaguely biologically centered view of how human beings
2933280	2937760	conduct themselves because we're not yeast in a bloody petri dish we're not yeast and the world
2937760	2942720	isn't a petri dish let's put it that way and then you add to that though the closing statement which
2942720	2949680	is something like those of us who are properly oriented in our moral endeavor in relationship to
2949680	2958080	the non-human world can only sit and pray that the right virus comes along so that what so that
2958080	2965280	we're we're radically depopulated to what to what degree down to the half a billion people that the
2965280	2973840	world can hypothetically sustain it's like every single bit of that to me reeks of an underlying
2973840	2982560	and barely veiled brutal genocidal impulse i agree and what i want to draw attention to is that
2982560	2989840	this mentality diluted or not to various degrees is leading our thinking about what to do about
2989840	2995280	fossil fuels which is an existential issue for the world because the reason i go into this
2995280	2999440	particularly in fossil future is the point i'm making is that the people and institutions
2999440	3005040	were trusting to evaluate what to do about this source of energy that powers the world that also
3005040	3011440	emits co2 and impacts the climate those people are not making that evaluation by anything resembling
3011440	3016960	the goal of advancing human flourishing on earth they are pursuing to a significant degree this
3016960	3022640	goal of eliminating human impact on earth and the economist george reisman had this article
3023280	3028880	a long time ago called the toxicity of environmentalism and one point he made that i never forgot
3028960	3034400	is he said listening to a modern environmentalist is like listening to a doctor who's on the side
3034400	3040080	of the germs somebody who doesn't have your best interests at heart and as an example
3040080	3045040	one of the people i pick on very deservedly in fossil future is michael man who's a climate
3045040	3050800	scientist and activist who is one of the leading advisors and if you look at michael man's statements
3050800	3057040	one thing he has said is the ideal population for earth is a billion people yeah yeah how can
3057040	3061600	you possibly say that there are eight billion people like how can you possibly look at earth
3061600	3066400	and say oh yeah it's too many people that has a murderous impulse to it if you just look at the
3066400	3071600	earth and you say oh yeah seven billion people should go and what i point out with michael man
3071600	3076000	is that if you look at how he's evaluating the issue he's totally indifferent to the benefits of
3076000	3080080	fossil fuels he has a whole book people can look it up called the madhouse effect about fossil
3080080	3084240	fuels and climate and he doesn't mention any benefits of fossil fuels for example he talks
3084240	3088960	about agriculture and fossil fuels he only talks about negatives he doesn't once mention
3088960	3094960	diesel powered agricultural equipment or natural gas derived fertilizer even though those make it
3094960	3100480	possible for us to feed eight billion people so what we have is an anti-human mentality
3101280	3110560	so so some of those who are listening likely don't know that the the very survival of about four
3110560	3117360	billion people so half the world's population depends in no small part on the provision of
3117360	3124880	ammonia as fertilizer and ammonia is primarily derived from natural gas and so what that means is
3124880	3130400	the not just on the energy front let's point this out is that the the very food that is
3130400	3137120	provisioning half the world's population is a direct consequence of the cheap and easy accessibility
3137120	3144560	of natural gas and so and so what what's the idea here that we're supposed to reduce our
3145120	3150800	provision of fossil fuels and what are we going to do on the ammonia on the ammonia front we're
3150800	3157360	going to drive the price of fertilizer ever more skyward well if we do that because that
3157360	3162800	would be the consequence of reducing the plentiful supply of natural gas if we do that then what will
3162800	3168880	happen is clearly food will get more expensive and so will energy but food will definitely get more
3168880	3175280	expensive and so what that will mean is that huge swath of the world's population that's
3175280	3181040	living on the edge where they can just right now afford enough food to feed themselves so they don't
3181760	3187600	suffer the consequences of nutritional privation or even die a huge proportion of those people
3187600	3192160	are going to be tipped back into absolute poverty their children are going to be intellectually
3192160	3196960	stunted as a consequence and they might well starve and then you think well why would we
3196960	3201920	do that and if the answer is well you know some of us really believe that the planet should only
3201920	3208080	have a billion people on it if that if we have to have any people at all then well maybe this is all
3208080	3216880	part of the unconscious drive towards and and conscious drive to some degree towards reducing
3216880	3221440	the planet's population no matter what the price may be and then you see how people justify this
3221440	3226000	they say things like well you know if we don't take emergency action right now which means
3226560	3232640	let's make the poor even poorer then the poor are really going to suffer a hundred years from now
3232640	3238320	and I think look I don't have a lot of confidence in your ability to predict even a decade out much
3238320	3244960	less a hundred years with your unstable economic models that are predicated on an equally unstable
3244960	3249920	climate model so we can forget about your capacity to prognosticate a hundred years down the road
3250560	3255440	but what you're saying essentially is that the hypothetical poor that occupy my utopian
3255440	3262240	imagination are much more important than the actual poor right now who will definitely die
3262240	3269840	if we implement our higher energy price inducing hypothetical environmental policies
3269840	3274240	you know and one of the things that strikes me is so utterly absurd it's partly why I found your
3274240	3280560	book so interesting is that somehow the people who are making such arguments have gained the moral
3280560	3285680	upper hand even though you don't have to scrape beneath the surface very far to see not only the
3286320	3293600	genocidal metaphor and the genocidal intent but the actual genocidal impact of these policies
3293600	3297760	because we're definitely tipping people back into absolute privation
3299600	3303600	we'll be right back to our conversation with alex epstein in just a moment
3303600	3308000	first we wanted to give you a sneak peek at jordan's new documentary logos and literacy
3310880	3317920	I was very much struck by how the translation of the biblical writings jump started the development
3317920	3324640	of literacy across the entire world illiteracy was the norm the pastor's home was the first school
3325200	3331600	and every morning it would begin with singing the christian faith is a singing religion probably
3331600	3337360	80 percent of scripture memorization today exists only because of what is sung this is amazing here
3337360	3346320	we have a guttenberg bible printed on the press of yohan guttenberg science and religion are opposing
3346320	3353120	forces in the world but historically that has not been the case now the book is available to everyone
3353120	3361440	from Shakespeare to modern education and medicine and science to to civilization itself
3362000	3366800	it is the most influential book in all of history and hopefully people can walk away
3367840	3369200	with at least a sense of that
3374160	3377840	yeah there's a lot of there's a lot of really interesting stuff going on I mean I think one
3377840	3382720	thing why do they have the moral high ground and this is something that is really a core mission of
3382720	3388080	mine to correct is that as I mentioned before they really owned the issue of a good environment
3388080	3393440	starting in the 60s including loving nature including caring about clean air and clean water
3393440	3398400	and more recently caring about safety from climate and that the pro-capitalism side really didn't
3398400	3402560	concern them to concern themselves too much with this rhetorically at least and so the
3402560	3407840	anti-capitalist side was able to own this issue and when you own something as important as our
3407840	3413680	environment and our planet you do get the moral high ground and then they supplemented this
3413680	3420480	with this false alternative of you are either a climate change believer who hates fossil fuels
3420480	3425600	or you're a climate change denier who thinks fossil fuels are okay so they created this
3425600	3430400	total fossil alternative which made no sense because what makes sense with climate impact
3430400	3435360	is to weigh it along with the benefits of fossil fuels you cannot judge a prescription drug
3435360	3440080	by only looking at negative side effects and you can't judge fossil fuels by only looking at
3440080	3443920	negative side effects or exaggerate a negative side effects you have to look carefully at our
3443920	3448880	climate impacts negative and positive and then weigh them against the benefits that come with
3448880	3453040	fossil fuels including all the benefits that protect us from climate so there's this false
3453040	3457760	alternative so what they did is they owned the morality of caring about our environment and they
3457760	3462720	owned the claim to science because the climate change denial thing so-called didn't make much
3462800	3467760	sense because it's pretty obvious we impact climate at least some but so doing those two
3467760	3471600	things they owned this issue so people think well if I want to be a good person if I want a good
3471600	3476560	planet and I want to be pro-science then I have to hate fossil fuels and a lot of what I've tried
3476560	3480640	to do and I think Michael Schellenberger of Bjorn Lomborg and Steve Kuhn and I think what we've
3480640	3487360	tried to do is look at climate in a humanistic full context way and we're breaking this false
3487360	3491120	alternative which is a lot of the reason we get a lot of hostility so you said something there
3491120	3495760	that's very psychologically interesting so you said if I want to be a good person
3496400	3502800	because the environmentalists have captured this pro-planet narrative if I want to be a good person
3502800	3508560	then I have to buy the human beings are bad for the planet narrative but I'd like to take that
3508560	3515360	apart a little bit too because it's not exactly true what you said the truth of the matter is
3515360	3521440	something like if I want to take a shortcut to a good person without having to being a good
3521440	3528480	person without having to put into the process any real time and effort so that would mean
3528480	3533200	actually understanding the issues that are associated with environmental management and
3533200	3539760	economic sustainability which is unbelievably complicated I mean Bjorn while in U2 Schellenberger
3539760	3544800	spent their whole lives devoted to that endeavor trying to wade through the complexities it's
3544800	3551920	actually really difficult to develop a sophisticated and genuinely moral stance on the environment
3551920	3558320	and the economy it takes years and years of work and it's also extremely difficult to be a good
3558320	3564160	person and merely feeling sorry for the planet does not make you a good person in fact what it
3564160	3571760	makes you is a shallow narcissist who's using the easy identification with a genocidal ideology
3571760	3579920	to elevate yourself in the moral hierarchy and we we see people who are peddling this this dreadful
3580960	3586960	story to young people and offering them an easy shortcut to something approximating
3586960	3591440	easily trumpeted moral virtue and that's the sort of moral virtue that you can post on your
3591440	3596480	Facebook page when you claim that while you're anti-capitalist and you're in favor of the planet
3596480	3600880	and therefore all of a sudden you're actually a moral actor and someone to be regarded with
3600880	3606160	admiration and none of that's true because it's actually it's very difficult to be a good person
3607520	3612160	but it's very powerful that I agree entirely but it is very powerful and one thing I talk
3612160	3618080	about in fossil future and this is a big mission of mine is the moral monopoly of what I call the
3618080	3623520	moral case for eliminating fossil fuels has to be broken and when you have what I call a moral
3623520	3629520	monopoly you basically get a halo over your head for saying I hate fossil fuels I care about the
3629520	3634560	climate I care about the planet you don't need to do anything you just need to express this sentiment
3634560	3638640	doesn't matter you can we see you can fly on private jets you can live any lifestyle that you
3638640	3644160	want as long as you say this you get this halo and the other side gets devil horns on their head
3644160	3648400	but part of what's happened with what I call the energy humanists including me and Bjorn and Michael
3648400	3655760	and Steve is that we have now shown that actually quote saving the planet in their false view is
3655760	3662000	hurting billions of people and dooming them to poverty and actually making our environment worse
3662000	3667760	and hurting biology and so now they hate that that's why there's such vicious attacks because
3667760	3672800	their racket is coming to a close you you want it to be a controversial the first thing before
3672800	3677280	winning a debate is actually creating a debate there hasn't even been a debate over the morality
3677280	3682560	of fossil fuels intel fairly recently and once the debate is created that that easy claim to
3682640	3687680	virtue will disappear and those people will just go pick the the next easy thing to join
3688320	3695120	yeah well you said that all you have to do is express the sentiment that you care for the
3695120	3700320	planet so that's something approximating a feeling or a subjective state of mind let's say yes I'm a
3700320	3707520	good person because I feel empathy for the planet which is a pretty damn low resolution definition
3708240	3713040	implementable morality but you know it's tied in with something else too so imagine you're trying
3713040	3718880	desperately to make that case that the reason I'm good is because I feel sorry for things including
3718880	3726160	the planet well then you have to also buttress that claim with the insistence that sentiment
3726160	3732880	subjective sentiment itself is the only valid arbiter of reality and so that's something like
3732880	3741120	I feel therefore I am and I see that this in this entire modern movement that insists that identity
3741120	3748240	is nothing other than subjective feeling is actually associated in a perverse manner
3748240	3754560	with this ability to justify a claim to moral superiority by appeal to sentiment it's like
3754560	3762240	it's people see a picture of a like a bedraggled kitten on on on the internet and they go oh
3762240	3768080	and they think that because they have that reflexive response which you know has a certain moral virtue
3768080	3774560	that all of a sudden they're morally admirable people and that's a lovely thing to believe
3774560	3779840	and you can extend that to something like well I'm so concerned about the planet that I can barely
3779840	3785280	sleep at night it's like well fair enough that might be an indicator of your moral virtue although
3785280	3790800	I suspect not but the real question is do you actually know anything about the problem have
3790800	3797520	you spent any work real work in differentiating your knowledge of the problem are you taking any
3797520	3804080	concrete steps whatsoever to solve it apart from hand waving sentimentally and do you have metrics
3804080	3808960	in place that actually help you measure whether or not what you're doing has a beneficial impact
3808960	3814800	and that's also complex that if you bring to people's attention the necessity of thinking it through
3814800	3819440	all they do is get irritated at you like they get irritated with longberg's a classic example
3819440	3826080	because he's the person I think and I'd like your opinion on this you know I don't think there is
3826080	3833120	anybody who's a more effective advocate for genuine progress on the environmental front
3833120	3839120	than Bjorn Lombard he's thought it through as far as I can tell more deeply than anyone else
3839120	3847760	perhaps in the world and it's stunning to me the degree to which his ideals fail to gain traction
3847760	3851600	and I think partly it's because he makes the issue complicated right he says well we don't
3851600	3859120	have just one problem too much carbon we have like 20 problems or a hundred and and they all
3859120	3863680	need to be attended to but we need to rank order them and we have to do that in a methodologically
3863680	3868800	rigorous manner it's like well we don't want to do any of that we just want to feel good about what
3868800	3873840	we feel good about and we want to make a claim that that makes us morally virtuous and it's certainly
3873840	3880560	the case as far as I can tell that our educational systems are enticing young people to adopt exactly
3880560	3887040	that attitude and then to also engage in this demonization that you described so I think one
3887040	3893040	powerful dynamic with this this free virtue that you get by just saying I care about this issue I
3893040	3898960	care about the planet is that it's been given the stamp of science because it's considered scientific
3898960	3903440	to just say hey the planet is being destroyed by fossil fuels we need to do something about it
3903440	3908640	and it's really as long as you feel some way or you vote some way that is considered totally
3908640	3913920	sufficient there's nothing to think about but so it's really sad and shameful that science
3913920	3918640	has been has been stamped on this incredibly irresponsible way of thinking and one thing
3918640	3922720	I've tried to do and I think Bjorn does this but I think I do it probably most explicitly and I
3922720	3927600	think it's very very important to do it explicitly is I keep talking about the benefits of fossil
3927600	3933120	fuels and how how the other side is ignoring the benefits of fossil fuels so I go as far as to call
3933120	3937840	the other side fossil fuel benefit deniers I also call them climate mastery deniers because
3937840	3943040	they deny our ability to master climate danger and I think people can really get that we're
3943040	3947360	thinking about this issue in a way that makes no sense because we're only looking at the negative
3947360	3951520	side effects of fossil fuels we're not looking at the benefits and if you look at my work the
3951520	3956720	moral case for fossil fuels fossil future it's really stressing the goodness of fossil fuels
3956720	3961920	not just fossil fuels aren't as bad as you think but they're an actual positive good and I've seen
3961920	3966720	you make this case as well I think it's very very powerful it's imagine my book had been called
3966720	3972080	fossil fuels aren't quite as bad as you think it would have been no impact what's really needed
3972080	3977760	we've had this inverted morality that said that that says that food is poison and poison is food
3977760	3982080	and I think it's not enough to just to say oh they go too far it's to say no they are attacking
3982080	3987680	something good and once you are having a positive case for fossil fuels the other side goes on the
3987680	3992160	defensive you watch what happens when I debate when people will debate me they don't really have
3992160	3997360	an answer to looking at the full picture their answer is call me a climate change denier try to
3997360	4002880	smear me but they can't answer the argument of if you look at the full context benefits and
4002880	4007200	side effects of what's good for human flourishing fossil fuels are incredibly good and will remain
4007200	4012400	good for the foreseeable future and it's a pretty subtle argument that that climate change denier
4012480	4017600	phrase is a real interesting one too because that's a phrase that's so manipulatively
4017600	4022800	propagandistic that it's almost incomprehensible I mean the reason that that phrase emerged is
4022800	4030160	because there's been we've developed a universal consensus that denying the reality of the Holocaust
4030160	4036480	was a moral crime and so the propagandists took a leaf from that page and said well the people
4036480	4042480	who are denying the cataclysmic reality of climate change are as morally culpable as those who
4042480	4047600	deny the Holocaust which implies that they're as culpable as the Nazis who run the death camps
4047600	4052960	and that's a pretty decent smear and then you might say well what's the moral advantage to doing
4052960	4058160	that and so the first thing you might point out is well you get to have all the unearned moral
4058160	4063920	virtue that goes along with saying that just because you're sentimental about the planet
4063920	4069680	in some vague way that you're now a moral paragon and that solves all your moral problems
4069680	4076560	and then conveniently at the same time you get to identify a group of people who are essentially
4076560	4082000	satanic in their motivations and so that would be the climate change deniers and so that entire
4082000	4086560	problem of evil which you no longer contend with in your own life because you're on the side of the
4086560	4092480	moral is dumped at the feet of the people that you deem as enemies that's that form of scapegoating
4092480	4098320	that René Girard talked about and so young people are being enticed to do two things is one is to
4099200	4106400	adopt it three things to adopt an extremely simple minded view of the problems and opportunities that
4106400	4113360	confront us second to claim a completely unearned moral virtue merely on the basis of a vague sentiment
4114080	4121040	and third and more dangerously to localize the problem of evil in the minds and souls of the
4121040	4126880	people who are hypothetically opposed to their self aggrandizing sentiment and the combination of
4126880	4132720	those three moral errors is really dangerously toxic and that dangerous toxicity I would say is
4132720	4138400	manifesting itself in such things as these this idiot insistence let's say in the UK
4139120	4144160	because they're suffering from this more than any other place now maybe except Germany on the moral
4144160	4149920	benefits of an impossible net zero right the the rubber is really starting to hit the road
4149920	4155040	in the last couple of years as energy prices have spiked out of out of reach of many people
4155760	4161600	and the unreliability of these hypothetically benevolent renewables has become more and more
4161600	4169200	self-evident and so we're walking a very dangerous moral path here right easy moral virtue the the
4169200	4175120	our inability to point out that a lot of this moral virtue is driven by an unthinking ignorance
4175120	4180480	combined with this temptation to demonize those who are like lomborg shellenberger you
4180480	4185600	you're a good example as well who are standing up and saying hey wait a minute everyone um
4186240	4192480	we've lifted billions of people out of absolute privation and starvation as a consequence of the
4192480	4197920	utilization of fossil fuels and they're so fundamental that we can't shift away from them
4197920	4203200	rapidly that's actually practically impossible without tilting people into the kind of abject
4203200	4207600	poverty that's going to cause widespread starvation it's like that doesn't sound like a case being made
4207600	4215920	by satan to me no it's um i mean i do think that the energy crisis is an enormous educational
4215920	4220560	opportunity and it's obviously a tragedy and it's as somebody who's been talking about this for 15
4220560	4226560	years and advising in the opposite direction it's very sad to see me myself being right
4226560	4231360	in terms of if you artificially restrict the supply of fossil fuels in a world that needs
4231360	4236080	more energy and you don't have a viable near-term replacement then prices are going to skyrocket
4236080	4239760	including food prices and the price of everything else like this is this was obvious that this was
4239760	4244720	going to happen and it's hard to see it but at least the benefit is that people can see that the
4244720	4250480	establishment has failed that's the benefit of a crisis people see the establishment has failed
4250480	4255600	and the key is in my view two things one is the right people need to be implicated and the right
4255600	4260400	people need to be vindicated and i say the right people need to be implicated not as a vindictive
4260400	4265440	person at all uh but it's very important when you have a crisis and this happened with 9-11
4265440	4269680	happened with the financial crisis you know you need to have some idea of who is responsible
4269680	4274720	and then who was right and gave us better advice if you look at today's energy crisis
4274720	4280320	the number one thing that is scary about it is that it is a crisis that has come from the from
4280320	4286160	the net zero movement not even only achieving one percent of their goals so they have not even reduced
4286160	4291280	the supply of fossil fuels i want to stress that again they haven't even reduced the supply
4291280	4295760	they just slowed its rate of growth they already wanted to dramatically reduce the supply that was
4295760	4301120	their goal we were supposed to be using way less fossil fuel by now they just slowed the growth
4301120	4306160	and that was enough to cause a global energy crisis in a world that needs far more energy
4306160	4310400	so that should really wake us up what if we actually start on their path of getting rid of
4310400	4316320	fossil fuels and again we have 27 years now 27 years and less than a month as we record this
4316320	4320720	to achieve net zero which in effect means getting rid of fossil fuels we could talk about offsets
4320720	4326240	and stuff that doesn't work at any scale that there's any evidence of so it's really this this
4326240	4331280	homicidal movement in its in its consequences and i do think people are waking up and they're
4331280	4336080	particularly waking up to the idea that hey we ignored the benefits of fossil fuels or what i
4336080	4340960	call our designated experts did this and these people need to be jettisoned you cannot listen
4340960	4345680	to anybody about energy and climate who ignores the benefits of fossil fuels to billions of people
4345680	4350320	because if you do you get an energy crisis and if we keep listening to them it's going to get a lot
4350320	4356400	worse well the other thing that you see being the drum being beaten on the side of the radical left
4356400	4364240	for example is the anti-colonial um let's say this continual trumpeting of the anti-colonial
4364240	4370880	interference message and so then i look at that and i think well you give the devil is due and the
4370880	4375600	fact that the world's cultures have come into contact with one another in a dramatic way in the
4375600	4382880	last 300 years has produced all sorts of consequences some positive and some negative but um on the
4382880	4388080	anti-colonial front the environmental proposition and this is mostly coming from the radical left is
4388080	4396720	that there's no possible way that the third world inhabitants can be allowed much less encouraged
4396720	4403600	to develop a standard of living that in any manner approximates the profligate west is that
4403600	4408240	we're rich and you know maybe we should suffer from that a bit and maybe we should pay reparations
4408240	4413040	let's say but all those poor people who are desperately trying to clamber up the socioeconomic
4413040	4419280	hierarchy so they don't die let's let's make that perfectly clear they can't be allowed to do that
4419280	4424960	because their environmental footprint will immediately become so large that the planet
4424960	4430400	itself will be destroyed and so okay what's the consequence of that well the consequence of that
4430400	4436400	is that they should be poor and stay that way and should shut the hell up about it and should be happy
4436400	4442560	about it and perhaps there should be a hell of a lot fewer of them and if that doesn't trigger
4442560	4449760	your anti-colonialist morality then you've got some serious thinking to do because i just don't
4449760	4455120	understand at all how it is that those of us in the wealthy west and this would certainly include
4455120	4463280	those in the chattering environmental glitterati elite class i have no sense whatsoever how they're
4463280	4470960	in a moral position to be lecturing the developing world about how they should accept limits to growth
4470960	4475920	which means for example that their children won't have access to enough nutrition to even
4475920	4481360	optimize their their brain development as they mature it's like oh that's the price those people
4481360	4488320	get to pay hey those people those poor people in developing countries who don't get to be wealthy
4488320	4494080	and by wealthy means have enough to eat and have schools to send their children and we in the western
4494080	4499200	world we can sit on our high horse and say well we used fossil fuels and oops sorry about that and
4499200	4505600	all the carbon but you bastards you can just you can just accept your lot and if you stop breeding
4505600	4511280	so god damn much that would be a good thing too now how that is it's colonial to a degree that's
4511280	4518320	overwhelming is beyond me well it's it is and i think it's a very very powerful argument it's
4518320	4523120	been one of these things that has been ignored because the priorities of the modern environmental
4523120	4527040	movement are not what they say and i would say more broadly the anti-capitalist movement
4527040	4531680	they claim to be concerned about the poor but if you're concerned about the poor and you know that
4531680	4537120	fossil fueled productivity has brought an unprecedented number of people out of poverty
4537120	4542000	in recent decades you would think about how do we expand that how do we replicate what happened
4542000	4546800	in china what happened in india you know some changes to it obviously but how do we how do we
4546800	4551920	you know they use seven times more fossil fuels compared to four forty years ago like it's it's
4551920	4557360	obviously fueled their productivity and their prosperity why don't we do more of that and yet
4557360	4562160	there's been no attention paid in the culture to the energy poor there's no attention paid to the
4562160	4567040	fact we have three billion people who use less electricity than one of our refrigerators uses
4567040	4571360	we have a third of the world using wood and animal dung to eat their homes and to cook their food
4571360	4575760	and in terms of you're mentioning wealthy people three quarters of the world uses an amount of
4575760	4580880	energy that that we would consider totally unacceptable in the us or canada or anything
4580880	4587360	resembling that so once these facts are pointed out it is obvious that there is a moral imperative
4587440	4594240	to do at least nothing to get in the way of people using at least that at least that and it's clear
4594240	4598320	that the anti fossil fuel movement is absolutely getting in the way they're trying to destroy
4598320	4603920	all loans to fossil fuels there they're trying to encourage them to use things that will not
4603920	4607840	actually work for them they're trying to for example throughout africa limit oil and gas
4607840	4612880	development even though that's a huge potential source of prosperity but they're not winning this
4612880	4617200	argument once sunlight has been exposed and i had a personal experience i don't know if you heard
4617200	4621920	about this but the washington post tried to basically cancel my book fossil future back
4621920	4626320	before it came out they got a copy of the book they didn't read the book which i thought that was
4626320	4631280	their job as journalists to report on a book from a major author instead what they tried to do is
4631280	4637440	dig up what i had written in college where i had said very specifically the poor world needs more
4637440	4642640	capitalism and more individualism which i stand by but they somehow tried to portray that as
4642640	4647920	colonialism but here's the key their whole argument was alex epstein doesn't really care about the
4647920	4652640	poor so you don't have to listen to his arguments about the poor needing fossil fuels that this is
4652640	4658160	a bizarre ad hominem on its face it's completely the opposite of the truth but it was notable to me
4658160	4663440	how they had no answer to this argument that poor people need fossil fuels and that the
4663440	4668640	anti fossil fuel movement hurts the poor people most so i think that really shows the power of
4668640	4674480	this argument let's delve into that issue of caring about the poor because i don't think that
4674480	4679520	it is really all that wise for any of us to jump up and down about how much we care for the poor
4679520	4684880	because if you cared for the poor you'd be out there doing something with your life to directly
4684880	4690000	benefit the poor and that turns out to be extremely well i i have to i have to i don't mean i don't
4690000	4695760	mean you i don't mean you okay speaking more generally it's not that easy to care about the
4695760	4701280	poor and so i think that any of us who trumpet the idea that we truly care about the poor should
4701280	4707840	be very careful about that but having said that i would also say we could though say even if we
4707840	4713360	don't care about the poor any more than the typical somewhat selfish human being we could at least get
4713360	4718800	the hell out of their way when they're trying to clamber their way up the socioeconomic hierarchy
4718800	4723200	and that was the case that you made just a few minutes ago is that we could at least in the west
4723280	4730640	not implement policies that actually interfere in a serious manner with the attempts of the
4730640	4734880	developing world to lift themselves out of absolute privation we could at least get the
4734880	4740000	hell out of the road and we wouldn't have to do that by hand waving about how moral we are in
4740000	4746160	our care for the poor we could say well we're relatively disinterested at minimum but we won't
4746160	4751920	go out of our way to make your lives more miserable than they have to be while you use your own efforts
4751920	4757360	to acquire for yourself some of the things that we've managed to acquire we can't even do that
4758400	4762080	i think it's a great point and so for me yeah i don't want to act like i'm just
4762080	4766960	ministering to every poor person in the world or this kind of thing i mean look i i live in a free
4766960	4773040	country i love doing work that i find really interesting and i love that it benefits a lot
4773040	4778320	of people including some of the poorest people in the world and one that the particular way in which
4778320	4783440	i identify with the poorest people in the world is with the lack of freedom because i really think
4783440	4788160	about what what would it like be like to not be born in the u.s whatever advantages i had being born
4788160	4794560	in the u.s is by far the greatest and i really think about you know how can more people be born
4794560	4801120	into that and really the number one thing we need to do is spread good ideas and not spread bad ideas
4801120	4805360	and and this is where the antifausal field movement is so destructive particularly you've
4805360	4810240	probably seen this recent climate reparations thing yeah which is saying hey we owe the poor world
4810240	4814880	and i i wrote about this recently people can see it at energytalkingpoints.com which is where i post
4814880	4821040	my new stuff but the there's there's the idea that we should feel guilty for ruining the world and i
4821040	4825200	believe we've made the world better for everyone including the poor but the other element that
4825200	4831360	is obviously wrong is what is happening is we are paying people off usually dictators off
4831360	4837040	to not use fossil fuels so we are paying them to deprive people of the crucial freedom
4837040	4842320	to get prosperity and that is just totally shameful and that is absolutely interfering
4842320	4848480	in the lives of the world's poorest people right so with our so-called climate reparations
4848480	4854160	that are going to be devoted to the the governments of third world countries primarily we're going
4854160	4860320	to be propping up frequently brutal quasi dictatorships and bribing them to keep their
4860320	4866800	populations poor yes so that we don't save the planet that's our plan
4868960	4875280	that is that is a plan i mean again it's it's not a movement that actually has any kind of goal
4875280	4881680	in strategy long term it's really just hostility toward any impact and at the moment it's CO2
4881680	4886720	emissions so anything that has CO2 emissions you hate but observe look there's no enthusiasm for
4886720	4891520	nuclear right which you would expect them to love because it doesn't emit CO2 there's hatred
4891520	4896640	for nuclear there's hatred for hydro and there's hatred for mining which is necessary for solar
4896640	4901600	and wind which require way more mined materials than anything else there's so it's really an
4901600	4907440	anti-impact movement that's just hostile to any human impact and just nihilistically and randomly
4907440	4912800	pursues that with no strategy and no thinking about the future and this mentality is leading the
4912800	4918320	world this is what i call our knowledge system it is blindly pursuing this destructive anti-human
4918320	4924240	path with no strategy okay so let's let's delve into that a little bit that motivation for that so
4924240	4931760	i'm going to play devil's advocate here a bit and and and let you respond to it so the first
4931760	4938320	thing we might point out is that the the human proclivity for something approximating unspoiled
4938320	4944000	natural vistas actually seems to have a moral element and a biologically rooted moral element
4944000	4951760	so for example our our aesthetic preferences seem to be associated with something like preference
4951760	4957520	for natural landscapes that are verdant and green and potentially productive in relationship to
4957520	4964400	agriculture and and the flourishing of let's say edible animals with enough water we like landscapes
4964400	4968960	that look like that we think they're beautiful and the idea that we might prefer those if they were
4969840	4976800	unspoiled is also worth delving into to some degree because we do need to live in
4977920	4984640	balanced harmony with such environments so that we don't destroy the very virtue that they
4985440	4990720	they implicitly contain and so and our aesthetic preferences tilt us in that direction and so we
4990720	4999120	have a bit of a biological tilt towards not wanting to gum up and pollute the works okay so
4999760	5006720	so there's that and then we also have this moral sense that we have a moral obligation right and
5006720	5016640	so the moral obligation is to be grateful to be cognizant of our unearned privilege and so for
5016640	5021520	you that would be the fact that you were born in the united states and that you were a accidental
5021520	5026880	beneficiary of all the work that had gone into that great society before you made your appearance
5026880	5032000	on the scene and that there's a moral obligation on your part in some sense to do something about
5032000	5038880	that right and so and that can both of those can be warped the warping of the first one is
5038880	5045440	to push that moral and aesthetic sensibility to the point where we claim that any human
5045440	5053920	interaction with that pristine environment whatsoever is tantamount to immorality and on
5053920	5063120	the second front it is that the way to atone for our privilege is by being guilty and stopping all
5063120	5071280	activity so those things dovetail we might say instead that if we wanted to genuinely contend
5071280	5076960	with the problem of our unearned privilege and the fact that you know we walk on blood that is
5076960	5082720	being we walk on land that is being soaked by the blood of conflict for generations right there's a
5082720	5088000	certain guilt in that a certain sense you might say even of original sin is that we do have to atone
5088720	5094320	but the proper proposition on the sophisticated front would be something like well we should atone
5094320	5100640	by putting into place thoughtful and intelligent and genuinely pro-human environmental slash
5100640	5107360	economic policies and we should atone in our private lives for our unearned privilege by being
5108480	5114960	people whose moral striving is so admirable that we've justified the existence of our privileges
5115680	5120960	and we shouldn't be taking the easy way out and saying just because we're sentimental about Gaia
5120960	5126480	means that we've somehow fulfilled our moral obligation we're doing a very bad job of teaching
5126480	5132480	young people this as far as I can tell so like the guilt's there right the the sense of original
5132480	5137760	sin is there the sense that we're responsible for the atrocity of history in some sense is there
5137760	5142800	that needs to be contended with but we're constantly looking for easy ways out of the problem instead
5142800	5148640	of actually trying to address it head on well let's start out with the the first part in terms of
5148720	5154160	this this like sense of what we like in natural landscapes and we like life and so I certainly
5154160	5159360	have a version of this myself I mean I'm very obsessed with the ocean and I spend way more time
5159360	5165280	outdoors than most people and I just like I think people underrate being outdoors a lot and and you
5165280	5169840	know I love seeing different kinds of animals and their natural habitat so like I definitely
5169840	5176080	experienced this but when I when I think of it then what I think about is in impacting the earth
5176080	5180720	we want to make sure we impact the earth in a way that allows us to really enjoy this and in fact
5180720	5186240	have more of it there's a lot of things we can do to make the earth more beautiful and to enhance it
5186240	5190480	with respect to our aesthetic sensibilities and I think the the best thing forever in this regard
5190480	5195760	was Frank Lloyd Wright because if you look at his buildings and how he approached it he loved nature
5195760	5200240	but he also thought that we could improve nature and that's really what you're doing as a human
5200240	5204960	being is you're saying I can improve nature so you're not hostile to nature but you view it as
5204960	5210080	what I call wild potential it has the potential to be an amazing place for us it has all these
5210080	5213520	different building blocks and all these starting things and some of them we want to preserve
5213520	5217040	some of them we want to change a lot and even the things we want to preserve we want to make a
5217040	5222880	lot more accessible to everyone which requires changing a lot so I think of it as we can do an
5222880	5229040	even better job at making the earth an amazing place to live but part of that is recognizing
5229040	5234080	we've done a really good job in a lot of ways the earth is so much of a better place to live than it
5234080	5242320	was 500 years ago 200 years ago the world is is is you know it's naturally uh it's naturally dynamic
5242320	5246880	it's deficient and it's dangerous it's like those are three attributes that's why I call it wild
5246880	5252480	potential and so human beings have had to contend with that and to bring up fossil fuels our basic
5252480	5258480	way of contending with that is to try to produce a lot of value that nature doesn't produce for us
5258480	5262720	nature produces not very much value that we can use and it produces a lot of threat so we need
5262720	5268400	productive ability to create resources nature doesn't including to create resources that neutralize
5268400	5273040	the different threats like creating irrigation to neutralize drought and what we do that with
5273040	5278240	our productive ability but we're naturally very physically weak beings and so the key step is
5278240	5283680	using machines to produce far more value than our meager physical bodies can and that's what we've
5283680	5288400	done with fossil fuels we've had cost effective energy that has allowed say the average american
5288400	5294240	to have 75 machine servants producing value so that we can do far more than we ever could
5294240	5299360	and we can do types of things that we never could like no number of human beings can fly
5299360	5303680	no number of human beings can be an incubator which you know save millions incubator save
5303680	5309200	millions of lives so we've made the earth so much of a better place and I think we can make it even
5309200	5314480	more beautiful and I think a lot of the specific things we create are ugly and that's a shame but
5314560	5319840	I think of it as we've done a good job and we can do even better not that we're these sinners who
5319840	5325600	have ruined who ruin everything by touching it that is a that is a hostile view and it's an unjustified
5325600	5330080	view so I think we can be more like Frank Lloyd Wright but we should be proud of what we've done
5330080	5335040	so far and in terms of obligation I mean I feel gratitude for it I don't feel like
5335040	5341200	anyone has really sinned or I've sinned or but I feel like the obligation is to is to keep going
5341760	5345280	trying to make it better and better and I think just by being a productive person
5345280	5349760	that's really what you're doing but because I think about global issues I try to advise people
5349760	5356640	globally so let me ask you about this psychologically so obviously people there are a lot of people
5356640	5361920	particularly young people perhaps who are bearing a heavy load of existential guilt for the fact of
5361920	5368880	their very existence and so you just made something approximating a pro-human case and so I would ask
5368880	5375760	you a psychological question how do you think you've conducted yourself in your own life
5376720	5383920	effectively so that that sense of existential guilt that potential hostility towards human
5383920	5389280	endeavor itself or even human existence has been ameliorated like what have you done that you
5389280	5396000	believe is sufficiently valuable to justify the cost of your own existence but I guess
5396960	5401280	why would I I don't understand why I would feel it in the first place because the people who feel
5401280	5405360	it have a very warped at least the environmental version we can talk about other versions but
5405360	5410560	the environmental slash climate version is this very warped delicate nurture view of the earth
5410560	5415280	that the earth is stable sufficient and safe and our impact ruins it and if you believe that
5415280	5420640	and you hear all this propaganda then you think yeah we're all you we're all ruining the delicate
5420640	5426240	nurture but if you have that view it's a very damaging view but I don't have the view so I don't
5426240	5430880	understand why I would feel so bad yeah but people that's the thing is that and I think we need to
5430880	5438400	contend with this right because people do have that view and lots of people have it and it's easy
5438400	5443520	let's say for educators who are pushing this ideological agenda to capitalize on the prevalence
5443520	5449200	of that view that's why I'm pointing to something like an intrinsic sense of original sin is that
5449200	5453360	we have this sense as human beings or many people do that in some real sense
5453360	5459040	we have to atone for the crime of our existence and I think there's something to that I think that
5459040	5466240	we have to bear a moral burden that justifies the the crime of our existence so to speak
5466240	5471920	and that would mean that we have to be genuinely well in your terminology we have to be genuinely
5471920	5476320	productive people let's say we have to be genuinely productive people that are aiming up
5476320	5481520	maybe in relationship to such things as working for the amelioration of absolute poverty like
5481520	5487520	there is a moral calling there and I think that part I think of it differently okay I think of it
5487520	5492640	differently so I think of existence as an opportunity so I think of it as it's just this
5492640	5497680	amazingly special thing that you know any of us exist in the first place I mean probably you
5497680	5502400	think about the probabilistic nature of it and I feel like being on earth is just this amazing
5502400	5506480	opportunity and you can look at how different people have handled that throughout history and
5506480	5511120	how they handle it today and I think a lot of people tragically haven't made the most of it but I
5511120	5515600	think you can see certain things that people do who have made the most of it and find it fulfilling
5515600	5520720	and for me one of the observations is people who choose a certain kind of creative work it
5520720	5524720	it is makes a huge difference I'm guessing you've experienced I've certainly experienced this in
5524720	5530400	terms of just finding something that creates value in the world that really really works with
5530400	5534960	how you like to use your mind the thought process hopefully you get to work with certain kinds of
5534960	5540400	people I mean that's just part of it there are all kinds of other opportunities of being alive so I
5540400	5545440	don't think about it all as oh it's we're guilty and this is bad I think the only guilt is wasting
5545440	5550720	the opportunity that's that's where my kind of fear and guilt come in is like I worry about oh did I
5550720	5555120	waste the opportunity of being alive and part of that is of course you don't want to live at the
5555120	5560240	expense of others and ruin the world that's another way of wasting it but so I think of life as
5560240	5566000	opportunity not as not as atonement well right and we should also we could address there too the
5566000	5572560	issue that if you conduct yourself successfully so let's say that you are as a consequence prosperous
5573120	5578400	there is also this underlying presumption that's generally unexamined that you had to do that at
5578400	5583280	someone else's expense right it's something like a zero sum game and that ties into this whole
5583280	5589680	Malthusian view that were yeast in a petri dish with finite resources and the truth of the matter
5589680	5597760	I think is that if you conduct yourself in the highest manner properly then you end up being
5597760	5603840	creatively productive in a manner that doesn't just benefit you selfishly but simultaneously
5603840	5610080	benefits many other people and also facilitates their ability to do the same thing and so that's
5610080	5615600	a vision of a kind of harmony that's a high-order ethical calling is you don't have to pursue your
5615600	5623760	creative exploitation of possibility at the cost of the possibility or at the cost of other people
5623760	5628720	quite the contrary you could increase the possibility which we could do on the natural front
5628720	5634640	and you could increase the ability of others to flourish simultaneously yes and I want to really
5634640	5639920	highlight because earlier you responded you said all these people have been have been immersed
5639920	5644640	in this what I call this dogma this delicate nurture dogma and I would add a piece to this
5644640	5649600	dogma it's it's the view that the earth is delicate nurture that say stable sufficient and safe and
5649600	5654480	then it goes along with what I call the parasite polluter view of human beings what you're getting
5654480	5659120	out with the Malthusian view so the view that all we do with our impact is we take from the earth
5659120	5664800	and we destroy it we make it ugly we disrupt it in this kind of thing and in so far as you view
5664800	5669440	the world this way you are going to have a bad life and you're going to be really unhappy
5669440	5673280	because you're going to feel really guilty and you're going to feel really pessimistic
5673280	5677920	and you're going to believe in all of these apocalyptic scenarios so it's it's why it's a
5677920	5683280	fundamental thing that needs to be done to reeducate people about the basic nature of earth
5683280	5689120	and the basic nature of human beings and replace so delicate nurture with what I call wild potential
5689120	5694640	and this parasite polluter view with what I call the producer improve our view we actually produce
5694640	5699920	value and we can improve the earth and we can do even more and in fossil future I talk about this
5699920	5704560	as part of the human flourishing framework a key part of how we have to think about this issue
5704560	5711040	is change our view of human beings and earth from an anti-human view to a pro-human view and if once
5711040	5715120	you change that in people it is life changing because it's their their whole view of how the
5715120	5720880	world works changes from this terribly sad and destructive view to a very optimistic view and
5720880	5726080	that that's one of the things I'm grateful for is early on I learned pro-human environmental
5726080	5731920	philosophy and that was a huge gift that I got when I was 18 how did you learn that why were you
5731920	5736560	fortunate enough to learn that well maybe we'll leave that look we have to stop we have to stop
5736560	5741760	this part of it we'll get into that in the next part of our discussion so for everybody who's
5741760	5748160	watching and listening I do an extra half an hour with my guests on the daily wire plus platform
5748160	5753840	as part of the arrangement that I've made with them to increase the professional appearance and
5753840	5760960	quality of my podcasts for example which as you are noticing are still available on YouTube free
5760960	5765840	for wide distribution I do an extra half an hour with people I would be interested and I'm going
5765840	5775200	to continue to talk to to elix on the daily wire plus platform about his philosophical journey
5775200	5781360	because you've definitely taken an unpopular stance and a minority unpopular stance and you
5781360	5786960	did that pretty early 2014 is pretty early given all things considered and and you did it quite
5786960	5792080	successfully you haven't been particularly effectively cancelled interestingly enough
5792800	5798000	and I'd like to find out what your pathway was to your realizations and how you manage that
5799040	5804400	hello everyone I would encourage you to continue listening to my conversation with my guest
5804400	5810400	on dailywireplus.com
