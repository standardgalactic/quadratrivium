1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
I mean, you mentioned, interestingly, people like Joe Rogan and Russell Brown being considered

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:11,760
a gateway to the alt-right. They're still traditionally politically more akin to the left,

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,320
but because they've deviated slightly, you have this kind of puritanical sledgehammer coming

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,040
down and saying, no, you're straying from what our ideology says you should believe.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,920
And that, to me, also feels like a fundamentalist religion.

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:45,440
Hello to everyone watching and listening. Today I'm speaking, once again, because we've done it

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,040
before, with playwright, journalist and political satirist Andrew Doyle, also known as Titania

8
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:59,040
McGrath. We discuss the intentional irrationality of the far-left doctrines that use religious

9
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:05,440
rhetoric and practices, despite the absence of God, or perhaps the presence of a different God,

10
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:12,640
their paramount desire to dismantle societal structures, regardless of need or merit,

11
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,800
the argument for transcendence inherent in the pursuit of art,

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,560
and how woke culture stifles genuine expression, forcing dogma to take the place of fundamental

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,600
truce and, say, purposefully doing so. Looking forward to it. Well, Mr. Doyle, it's good to see

14
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,480
you again. I think we're damn near friends, or at least I like you. I don't know what you think

15
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,320
about me, but... The feeling's very much mutual, Jordan. Thank you so much for having me.

16
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,480
Well, that's good. Well, us reprehensible types, you know, we need to stick together.

17
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:50,480
We do. Yeah. Yeah, that's for sure. So, the first, I thought I'd hassle you for a bit. First,

18
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,280
I got two things to hassle you about, I think. The first is, it says on your Wikipedia page,

19
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,280
for whatever that's worth, that you regard yourself as left-wing, and so I think you deserve

20
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,320
some harassment for that. But also, I don't know what the hell that means anymore. And then,

21
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,240
after I've done bugging you about that, I thought I'd bother you about having a PhD in

22
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,840
early Renaissance poetry and make the humiliation complete. Okay, let's start with the left-wing

23
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,960
thing. Okay, yes. Well, firstly, I'd say that Wikipedia is full of errors. I wouldn't trust

24
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,440
absolutely everything you see on Wikipedia. However, on that score, I think it's broadly

25
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:35,360
accurate. I know that, I mean, I've never voted for a right-wing party. I did vote for Jeremy Corbyn,

26
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:42,480
which, to be honest, I now regret. As you should. I think if you were to... I'm with you. I don't

27
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,480
really know what left-wing and right-wing means anymore. I think the culture war has, in fact,

28
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,880
obliterated those two designations. I really do believe that because, you know, if you were to

29
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:58,400
write down my views on most subjects and sort of give them to an impartial observer and say,

30
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,400
is this person on the left or on the right? I think broadly speaking, most of my values

31
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,160
would fall into what traditionally would be considered left-wing. I think I have some sort of

32
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,240
more conservative values when it comes to culture and education and the arts, perhaps.

33
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,920
But that's the same as someone like George Orwell, who was very much a cultural conservative,

34
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,520
as well as being a socialist. I think economically speaking, I do believe in

35
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,680
fair disproportionate taxation of the wealthy. I do believe in the welfare state.

36
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,960
All of those sort of, I believe, in redressing economic inequality, looking out for working

37
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,120
class people, social mobility. So all of these kind of things, I think, would traditionally be

38
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,520
deemed to be left-wing. But I think what the culture war has effectively done is

39
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:53,520
it's substituted identity, group identity, for the notion of class and money. And what that now

40
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,320
means is that people who describe themselves as left-wing are nothing of the kind. I mean,

41
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,360
most of the activists that you see, the sort of most vociferous cheerleaders of the critical

42
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,400
social justice movement tend to be, well, let's put it nicely, quite posh. They tend to have

43
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,480
quite plummy voices, double-barreled names. They're called things like Hugo Pondsford and

44
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,640
Sage Willoughby and things like this, particularly the case with environmental activists. You know,

45
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,760
there's people who glue themselves to Van Gogh paintings and the statue of David or whatever

46
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,320
it might be. When they talk, they are almost like a caricature, like the kind of thing that I would

47
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:33,120
have invented as a joke of a kind of fact. And have invented, in fact. Exactly. Well, Tatania

48
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:40,640
McGrath has that name because she's very, very well off. Part of the joke with that and part of

49
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,320
what I find so funny about so many of these activists is that they are bleeding about

50
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,440
oppression and persecution and privilege, and they're independently wealthy. They've got,

51
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,640
they've had everything handed to them on a plate. They're not in a position to do that.

52
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:02,000
Andrew, you know, look, I noticed this when I was teaching at Harvard, at Ivy League

53
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,160
school, obviously. And so all of my students were the top 1%, obviously. And if they weren't at that

54
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:17,360
moment, they were going to be by the time they were 40. So at worst, they were top 1% in what would

55
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,520
you call infancy. There we go. And so you might think that'd be good enough on the privilege side,

56
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,720
but it seems to me that there's a small coterie of very noisy people for whom being rich and

57
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,320
privileged is not enough. They also want all the victimization privileges of being oppressed,

58
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,520
because then you can have bloody well everything, can't you? And if you're a narcissistic psychopath,

59
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,640
then everything is what you want and you want it now. And I want to just follow up on that a bit

60
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:52,400
with regards to this left-wing issue. So, you know, there's about a dozen studies now. I want to

61
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,760
write an article about this or maybe even a book. There's about a dozen studies now

62
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,640
looking at the personality predictors of left-wing authoritarianism.

63
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:09,920
And so from the end of World War II till 2016, social psychologists in particular,

64
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:16,080
and that's a rather dismal discipline, denied the existence of left-wing authoritarianism outright.

65
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:23,200
It was only a right-wing phenomenon, apparently. You know, I mean, Stalin and Mao, notwithstanding.

66
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,560
But it started to switch a bit in 2016. We did a study in my lab, first of all, showing that

67
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,480
left-wing authoritarianism was a coherent, you could identify a coherent set of beliefs

68
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:40,160
statistically that were associated with so-called progressive causes allied with the willingness

69
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,840
to impose them using force, fear, force, and compulsion. So that's not a bad definition of

70
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,880
left-wing authoritarianism. But then a number of other studies have come out, and the most

71
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:57,200
interesting ones concentrate on what's known as the dark tetrad. And the dark tetrad is a group

72
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,680
of personality traits that were too evil to make it into the standard personality models.

73
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:08,400
They were excluded by fiat to begin with. Manipulativeness, that's Machiavellianism.

74
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,720
Psychopathy, which is predatory parasitism. Narcissism, that was the original dark tet

75
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,320
triad. But that wasn't bad enough, so the psychologists had to add sadism to it to fill

76
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:28,240
in the last quadrant. And the correlation between dark tetrad personality traits and left-wing

77
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:35,200
authoritarianism is so high that it isn't obvious that they're distinguishable. And so what I see

78
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,200
is... Is it not similarly high amongst right-wing authoritarianism?

79
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,040
No, it's not. So it's a different kind of authoritarianism?

80
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,400
Yes. I mean, this isn't clearly laid out yet, but the focus at the moment...

81
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,400
I think, first of all, anybody who's willing to use fear and compulsion and force

82
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,200
is likely to also be characterized by those dark tetrad traits. But I think the additional

83
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,160
pathology that emerges on the left, and this is something we can discuss, obviously, is that

84
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:18,480
you have to be a particular kind of evil snake to mask your psychopathic power-mongering in the

85
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:24,000
guise of compassion. And I don't think the right-wing authoritarians do that. They more or less come

86
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,240
right out and say, like, fuck you, I'm going to take everything you have, especially if you're

87
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,880
a group I don't like. But the left-wing types, they say, well, you know, really, I'm your best

88
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,840
friend. Historically speaking, is that necessarily the case? I mean, you know, if you take the example

89
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:44,480
of the Third Reich and Nazism, that was underpinned by a belief, a sincere belief,

90
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,920
a sort of quasi-religious belief that what they were doing was for the good of society.

91
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,760
However, abhorrent, we might find it.

92
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,040
Look, fair enough, man, I know perfectly well that in the 1930s, for example,

93
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,960
as the Nazis marched towards the death camps, their primary rationale for the

94
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,640
original implementation of youth in Asia, so to speak, of mass killing was compassionate

95
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,040
youth in Asia. But then I would also say, and this is something we actually don't know,

96
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:20,080
you know, that the Nazis were national socialists and their political stance was a weird mixture of

97
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,920
what we would think of as left and right-wing now, right? I mean, there was the fascist component

98
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,720
that involved the aggregation of power at the pinnacle, corporate and governmental,

99
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,800
and media, all of that, right? So that seems kind of right-wing and monolithic.

100
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:42,480
But it wasn't like they were, it wasn't, there were socialist elements in the platform as well.

101
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,200
And so we don't know enough to sort that out, I would say, maybe on the statistical side.

102
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,440
But doesn't all of this sort of point to the fact, or not even the fact, but my contention,

103
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,880
that actually thinking in terms of left and right when it comes to this

104
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,200
is kind of redundant. I think in a way you've sort of hit it.

105
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,320
Yeah, exactly.

106
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,480
Because the debate has always been the struggle between liberty and authority.

107
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,000
And so, you know, to go back to whether I'm left-wing or right-wing, I think I'm probably

108
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,280
just liberal. I think there are liberal-minded people on the left, there are liberal-minded

109
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:14,240
people on the right among libertarians. It's not something that is tied to a left-right worldview.

110
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:20,160
But when I hear people talking about how trying to frame the culture war in terms of left and

111
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,240
right, or to say that the culture war doesn't matter and there are more important things,

112
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,240
actually, this struggle between liberty and authority, which John Stuart Mill talks about

113
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,680
in his book on liberty. George Orwell has written about this. That's the thing that matters. And

114
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,800
the recognition that there is an authoritarian impulse in humanity, that there is an enduring

115
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,960
appeal to authoritarianism, whether you come from the left or from the right, this is something

116
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,200
that George Orwell has to go back to. He tackled this as well. It's precisely the reason why,

117
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,960
when he wrote Animal Farm, he couldn't get it published for so long because people were horrified

118
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,440
by the possibility that left-wing people could be authoritarian. And what he was saying is that

119
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:03,120
this is something that doesn't... It's irrespective of a left-wing view or a right-wing view. And I

120
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,880
think although you might be able to pinpoint psychological differences and tendencies among

121
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,040
those on the left who have an authoritarian bent and those on the right who have a similar

122
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,160
authoritarian bent, perhaps it's more useful just to think, particularly when it comes to the culture

123
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,560
war, in terms of who believes in traditional liberal values. I know that means something very

124
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:27,280
different in America, but liberal values insofar as individual autonomy, shared humanity, freedom,

125
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:33,280
freedom of expression, freedom of the press, etc. Those kind of liberal values you can do whatever

126
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,600
you want with your life, so long as it does not impinge upon the rights of others. That's something

127
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,080
that left and right can agree on. And the social justice warriors, whilst they might call themselves

128
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,400
left-wing, really their movement is characterized by authoritarianism. They oppose those liberal

129
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,280
values. Well, that's what it looks like. And quite... Well, not just what it looks like, quite

130
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:57,280
explicitly. I mean, the early critical race theory texts explicitly say... I mean, if you read Derek

131
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,400
Bell who wrote an essay called Who's Afraid of Critical Race Theory, he talks about how critical

132
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,760
race theorists have always mistrusted liberalism. They see the liberal project as having failed,

133
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:14,000
because we still live in a society where racism exists. And they take that as evidence that liberalism

134
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,120
doesn't work, rather than... Right, because the previous societies were so non-racist.

135
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:26,320
Right, exactly. They don't understand that point. The social liberalism is about an ongoing process.

136
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,760
It's about recognizing that we live in an imperfectible world and trying to do our best

137
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:36,960
with a bad lot. And the problem is that authoritarians tend to be, as well, kind of utopians,

138
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,720
even though in the case of the social justice activists, I don't think they've got a clear

139
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:47,680
sense of what their final ideal society would look like. At the moment, they just seem to me

140
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:54,000
to be on a sort of rampage of destruction. Yeah, well, that is what it would look like.

141
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,040
I've always thought that Hitler got exactly what he was aiming at. He shot himself while

142
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,160
Europe was burning. And it's like a big fuck you to God, fundamentally.

143
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,680
Well, that was because he was the personality type that would rather everyone was torn down

144
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,640
rather than he fails. I mean, one of the things that comes in...

145
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,760
Precisely, yeah. Well, that is the dark tetradite, man. That's for sure.

146
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,960
Right. I mean, he was deeply narcissistic. He would ball people with those lectures

147
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:27,760
late at night when no one was interested. It was all about him. One thing that comes out

148
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,800
very clearly, there's a great biography of Hitler by Ian Kershaw. One thing that very much comes

149
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,560
out about that is this guy was a narcissist. And when he knew that the game was up, he wanted

150
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,200
everyone to pay, all of the German people. That's narcissism right there, man.

151
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,680
That's absolutely right. Well, and he said that, you know? I mean,

152
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,360
at near the end of the Second World War, when the Russians were advancing on Berlin,

153
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,800
he continually expressed his dismay at the uselessness of the German people who had failed him.

154
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,160
Yes, exactly. And those who had failed on the Eastern front or from his perception

155
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,360
had failed, even though he'd put the military in an impossible situation,

156
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,240
couldn't take any responsibility for his own mistakes. But that kind of narcissism,

157
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,480
and I don't like comparing social justice activists to Hitler. I think that's their trick.

158
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,240
That's what they do. They call everyone Hitler. But I think you can definitely see

159
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:31,760
that combination of narcissism and also a kind of religiosity, intolerance, and yes,

160
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,400
exactly what you say, a desire to destroy. You know, that if we can't get our way,

161
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:41,360
we'll just destroy everything. Okay, so let's talk about that. I want to use that as a segue,

162
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,000
and I haven't tortured you about having a PhD in Renaissance poetry. We'll get back to that.

163
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,320
I want us to use that as a segue into the religious issue because you wrote a book here recently.

164
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,280
Just make sure I get title exactly right. The New Puritans, How the Religion of Social

165
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:02,080
Justice Captured the Western World. And so we could talk about religious issues. I've been thinking

166
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:09,920
recently along the religious lines, let's say, that what we're seeing is just the modern manifestation

167
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,080
of an eternal battle. And that battle is laid out first, very early in the biblical corpus,

168
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:23,520
in the story of Cain and Abel. Because what you have in that story is two modes of adaptation,

169
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:29,440
which I think roughly parallel a kind of demented narcissistic authoritarianism and a kind of

170
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,600
responsibility laden individualism. We can discuss that. But what happens is,

171
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,680
Cain and Abel make sacrifices, right? And that's what people do when they work, because work is the

172
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:48,800
sacrifice of the present to the future. And human beings uniquely work. I mean, maybe beavers work

173
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,960
in bees, but look, essentially human beings uniquely work. We're willing to sacrifice the

174
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:01,600
present for the future. Now, what happens in the story of Cain and Abel is that Cain appears to make

175
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:10,480
bloodless and relatively low quality sacrifices, whereas Abel's all in. And the consequence of

176
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,080
that is Abel gets rewarded by God and everyone loves him and things go well for him. And Cain,

177
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:23,120
nothing goes his way. And then instead of noticing that maybe he has something to do with that,

178
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:30,000
he calls God out for creating an improper cosmos and really puts him on the stand. And God says,

179
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,600
look, buddy, if you got your act together, things would go well for you. And the fact that they're

180
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,920
not might have more to do with you than me. And Cain thinks, to hell with you, God, I think I'll

181
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,840
go kill your favorite. And so that's the story. And that's one hell of a brutal story. And then,

182
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,600
Cain's descendants, including Tubal Cain, which is about four generations down the line,

183
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,520
they're the builders of the Tower of Babel and also the first people who make implements of war.

184
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,360
So there's an idea there that there's a resentful and bitter,

185
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:11,600
revengeful spirit that preoccupies mankind and that it can spread out from the individual and

186
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:17,680
take out the entire polity. And I can't help but see a reflection of that on the intellectual

187
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,560
landscape now in the political domain. Now, I'm curious about what you think about such things,

188
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:28,800
because you have described this new movement, let's say, as religious. So what do you mean by

189
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:34,560
that? What do you think about these more metaphysical speculations? I suppose I should be very clear

190
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:39,680
about that. And in the book, I do make it clear. I've called the book The New Puritans, and I refer

191
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,760
to the religion of social justice, because one of the things I'm very keen to do, and one of the

192
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,440
reasons why I feel that the critical social justice activists are winning is because a lot of people

193
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,400
do not understand their aims, they don't understand what they're about, and that they are effectively

194
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,280
fall for the linguistic tricks. I mean, you all know that the culture war is largely about who

195
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:05,120
gets to define the meaning of words. Activists often use words, but they mean the opposite.

196
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,280
They call themselves progressive, for instance, but I believe that they are regressive.

197
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,600
They call themselves liberal, but they are deeply illiberal. They're in favor of censorship and

198
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:20,320
authoritarianism. They scream about fascism while they themselves are using fascistic tactics,

199
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,880
such as violence to silence political opponents. So the language, unless you understand

200
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,680
where they're coming from, and unless you understand that theirs is a belief system,

201
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:37,520
which is largely tied to unfalsifiable claims, which depends upon a kind of coterie of high

202
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,440
priests, edicts from above, telling the masses what they should believe and punishing those who

203
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,360
descend. It has all the hallmarks of fundamentalist religion, at least, the idea of excommunicating

204
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,960
heretics, sort of sniffing out heretics, searching for them, and doing the metaphorical

205
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,080
equivalent of burning them at the stake, which is what we call council culture,

206
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,120
destroying their livelihoods, destroying their reputations, a kind of merciless, brutal,

207
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,680
cruel and vicious quality, which nonetheless dons the guise of compassion and righteousness.

208
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:17,760
You know, I'm sure that bullies and innately cruel sociopaths throughout history have probably

209
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,320
been attracted to the priesthood, because it gives them the opportunity to have a being,

210
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,480
a figure of authority to enact cruelty, and at the same time, to be validated as a principal

211
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,880
and important member of society. So I think it does mean like Pharisees and scribes,

212
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,560
those sorts of people. Exactly. I'm not suggesting for a second, you know,

213
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:41,040
if you take something as brutal as the Inquisition, I mean, I'm sure a lot of those people involved

214
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,000
felt that they were doing God's work and genuinely thought they were on the side of the angels,

215
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,760
but you can be damn sure that there were some psychopaths who were attracted to those positions

216
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,800
of power. So when I'm saying that I talk about the religion of critical social justice, I'm doing so

217
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,240
to try and make it accessible. I've found that if you just, because it is so baffling to everyone,

218
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,280
most people are completely baffled because for a start, they have their own kind of esoteric

219
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,360
language, this terminology like heteronormativity and toxic masculinity and cisgender, etc. Words

220
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,320
that most people just don't even know what they mean. But if you see them as kind of a biblical

221
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,520
script or a religious text, and they do have their foundational holy texts such as Foucault

222
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,880
and Judith Butler and things like that, if you make this analogy to religion, I think it makes

223
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,480
the movement comprehensible. And I think in order to defeat it, it has to be comprehended.

224
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,560
And I think most people can't comprehend it. So let's try to get at something that might

225
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,800
approximate a definition of religion. So this is how I've been thinking about it technically.

226
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,880
So imagine that you see the world through a hierarchy of presuppositions,

227
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,000
which you have to because you're fundamentally ignorant. You have to presuppose things in order

228
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,760
to move forward because you don't have infinite knowledge. So you have to look at the world

229
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:03,120
through a hierarchy of presuppositions. Then you can imagine that some presuppositions are deeper

230
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:10,000
than others. And what that would mean is some presuppositions very little, very few other

231
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,560
presuppositions depend on, and some presuppositions many other presuppositions depend on.

232
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,560
Right? Sort of like it's like citation depth in the scientific literature. And so freedom of

233
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:27,760
speech, for example, would be a presupposition in a liberal polity upon which almost all other

234
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:35,200
presuppositions rest. So if you move it, you're moving the depths. So a religion specifies the

235
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,880
deepest presuppositions and they have to be axiomatic because that's sort of where your ignorance

236
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,280
bottoms out. You have to say, I hold these things to be self-evident before you can proceed.

237
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:50,720
And that is something like the existence of a deity as a presupposition that has to underpin.

238
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:58,400
Right. Okay. So that's the next issue. So Carl, I read a lot of Carl Jung years ago and very deeply.

239
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:05,040
And one of the things Jung said about Protestantism, which I found remarkable, he criticized both

240
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:11,120
Catholicism and Protestantism as a friendly critic, I would say, pointing out that the

241
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:18,640
the temptation that Catholicism might fall prey to is one of centralizing authoritarianism.

242
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:26,960
And the temptation that Protestantism falls prey to is fractionating individualism. He said,

243
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,160
the logical conclusion of the Protestant revolution is that every single person becomes their own

244
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:38,080
church. And so it looks to me like that's happened and what's happened. And psychologists have

245
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,360
abetted this. And even the great clinicians, I believe, have abetted this regardless of my

246
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:51,040
admiration for them by substituting the self for God. And I think what you have, especially on the

247
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:58,400
psychopathic narcissistic fringes of what used to be the left, and you see this on the right as well,

248
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,520
is the momentary self elevated to the status of God.

249
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,480
Well, you see that an awful lot, which I think is why, I mean, you've identified the narcissism

250
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,320
within these kind of movements, but also the rapidity with which they resort to religious

251
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:20,320
terminology or religious ideas or religious modes of expression, for instance. You remember when

252
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,840
them, was it outside of Netflix when they were protesting against Dave Chappelle's show? And

253
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,360
there was that comedian protesting with a sign that said, we like Dave or we like jokes. I think

254
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:37,200
they had signs like that. And a one woman cornered him and it was all caught on film. And she screamed

255
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:43,600
repeatedly in his face, repent, mother, she said it again and again and again. And I mentioned that

256
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,720
in the book, because I love that that sort of combined that combination of rage and religiosity,

257
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,840
I think really encapsulates what the movement is all about. I think in terms of the presuppositions

258
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,960
of that movement, which it takes as axiomatic, it's not supernatural. Okay, it doesn't talk about

259
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,840
a deity, even though it has its profits, I think, from the French post-structuralist of the 1960s.

260
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,920
But I think it does have certain axiomatic presuppositions such as

261
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,080
there are power structures that dominate society, that underpinned all human interaction. And these

262
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,440
are based on the notion of group identity. And that that is how society needs to be understood.

263
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,880
As Foucault talked about grids of power through society, power not being a top down phenomenon,

264
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,680
something that sort of is latent within all of our interactions and behavior.

265
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,680
And they see that they believe that these activists believe that they can pick this

266
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:44,480
apart and understand it and remedy the wrongs in society, so long as they can identify where

267
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:52,080
the power structures lie and who is exercising privilege at the expense of the oppressed. That's

268
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:58,480
why critical race theorists, I mean, it was put like this in James Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose's

269
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,080
book, that the key question that you ask if you are a critical race theory is not a theorist, is not

270
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,840
did racism take place in this situation, but how did racism manifest in this situation?

271
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,560
Yes, right, right.

272
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:15,600
So it's almost like a ghostly spiritual thing that is always there. I think that's one of their

273
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,120
that's one of their major presuppositions.

274
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,560
Well, then, well, so here's another way of thinking about that from the religious perspective.

275
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:30,400
I mean, Milton Satan is an authoritarian narcissist and he rules over hell. And so

276
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:36,320
he's a figure that's very much analogous to Mao or to Stalin, right? He's someone who climbs

277
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:42,080
the most pathological possible power hierarchy and then regards himself as a victor even though

278
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:49,920
he's actually the biggest loser. And so, so Satan is the spirit, you might say in the Judeo-Christian

279
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:58,720
tradition, who rules the world by force. Now, the postmodern neo-Marxist types believe that there's

280
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:05,040
nothing but power. So I can't see that that's any different than a certain Christian heresy that

281
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:10,320
rose up in the Middle Ages, making the claim that Satan himself was the ruler of the earth,

282
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:16,560
right? Because the notion there is that power itself is the only or at least the ultimate

283
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,000
motivator and, well motivator is the right way of thinking about it. And so, and then

284
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,120
it follows a lot of things follow from that, right? One thing that follows from that is that

285
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,840
there's no such thing as free speech because there's just conflicts between different claims to power.

286
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,680
And that if you promote free speech, that's just an indication of how conniving you are

287
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,240
to use that entire philosophical language to do nothing but buttress your own colonialist

288
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,040
power claims. Yes, because their theories always put you in that position where you can't win.

289
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,040
You know, it's similar with with the critical race theory, they have their notion of interest

290
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,880
convergence. You know, when people say, well, there are extremely successful black individuals in

291
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,960
our history, Barack Obama, say, someone like that, they will say the only reason that those

292
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,400
people have succeeded is because it was in the interests of white people for them to succeed.

293
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,280
In other words, if black people don't succeed, right, so if black people don't succeed in society,

294
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,040
that's evidence of critical race theorists' claims. But if they do succeed, it's also

295
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,400
evidence of their claims because that's interest convergence. So they keep putting you in this

296
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:26,240
kind of situation. That to me has to be religion without, as in religious belief, that has not

297
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:32,480
been, it has merely been asserted rather than proven. The fact that they take on the very

298
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,720
notion of rationality, enlightenment ideas, the fact that they think that those things are even

299
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,560
part, and they also see that through group identity, that that is just the product of

300
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:46,240
some dead white men in periwigs. President Trump recently issued a warning from his Mar-a-Lago

301
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,040
home, quote, our currency is crashing and will soon no longer be the world standard,

302
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:55,920
which will be our greatest defeat, frankly, in 200 years. There are three reasons why the

303
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:02,240
central banks are dumping the US dollar, inflation, deficit spending, and our insurmountable national

304
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,000
debt. The fact is, there is one asset that has withstood famine, wars, and political and economic

305
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,840
upheaval dating back to biblical times, gold. And you can own it in a tax-sheltered retirement

306
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,320
account with the help of Birch Gold. That's right, Birch Gold will help you convert an

307
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:25,200
existing IRA or 401K, maybe from a previous employer, into an IRA in gold. When currencies fail,

308
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:31,440
gold is a safe haven. How much more time does the dollar have? Protect your savings with gold.

309
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,160
Birch Gold has an A-plus rating with the Better Business Bureau and thousands of happy customers.

311
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:53,520
So how do you understand this? There seems to be, okay, so we figure we've got a couple of,

312
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,240
what would you say, contenders for deity. One would be Satan himself, right, the spirit of

313
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,800
power. The other would be the untrammeled hedonic self. It's something like that. But then there's

314
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:10,960
a weird paradox there, not that the paradox bothers the postmodern types, that group identity is

315
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:20,560
paramount, but full, what would you say, full licentiousness on the personal front and the

316
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:27,760
granting of every whim on the personal front is also requisite. And I don't, I can't quite square

317
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:34,560
that coherently. Like, how is it that the radicals can push forward the notion that group identity is

318
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:40,880
the only identity, but also push forward the notion that everything possible is to be permitted every

319
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,400
individual at every moment. But you put your finger on it when you said that the paradoxes don't

320
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:52,400
trouble the postmodernists. You know, it's sort of built into their whole idea. When Derrida was

321
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:58,400
writing, he was trying to write incoherently. You know, it's part of it. He did manage. It's

322
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:07,200
absolutely unreadable. So let me try and understand what you're saying here. You were talking about

323
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,400
the idea that- Well, we see this worship of the self that emerged. So there's contenders for God,

324
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:19,440
right? We have power and we have the self. And then there's an element of that that spreads out

325
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,520
into identity. Now that the radical types definitely put forward group identity as paramount,

326
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,680
and yet they worship the self. What do you mean by licentiousness? What do you mean by

327
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,080
do they believe that absolutely everything is permissible, that any kind of individual

328
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,200
desire is able to be fulfilled? Because in their world, I think they're quite

329
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,040
prescriptive, aren't they, about which modes of behavior are acceptable and which aren't?

330
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:48,960
Well, that gets extraordinarily complex because it looks to me, one of the things I see on campuses

331
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:55,680
for example, is the insistence on the left progressive front, let's say, that any form

332
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,880
of sexual identity or behavior whatsoever is permissible. And not only permissible,

333
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:08,000
but to be celebrated. But now it's complicated because at the same time, every single interaction

334
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
between a young man and a young woman is so absolutely dangerous that it has to be subjected

335
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:21,040
to contractual validation before it can proceed. Well, yeah, well, it's a weird psychoanalytic

336
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:26,480
truism, that if you go too far in one direction, you simultaneously go too far in the other.

337
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,440
And that really muddies up the water. So the really narcissistic types, for example,

338
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,440
have an extremely uncertain core. But that doesn't make them any less, what would you say,

339
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,320
forthright in their claims that they should rule. So you can't stretch your, go ahead.

340
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:49,520
Well, I don't, I'm not so sure that it's about fulfilling any indulgence, no matter how depraved.

341
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,160
I think it's more about what they call queering society. I think it's more about,

342
00:31:54,160 --> 00:32:02,080
if it is in the service of demolishing the cis, white, hetero-patriarchal structures

343
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,000
that are in place, then that is seen as a benefit as something positive.

344
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,400
Right. So you think that licentiousness serves the purposes of demolition?

345
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,040
I do.

346
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:15,360
What about the reverse hypothesis is that, because I would say this might be more

347
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:22,320
true of Foucault, all the demolition was put forward to license the licentiousness.

348
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,800
I don't know. I mean, this is real.

349
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,560
Yeah, I'm not sure about that. I mean, a lot of people will say that because Foucault has,

350
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,640
as you know, a very shady past.

351
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,720
Yeah, you might say that.

352
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,360
Yeah, absolutely. And people have pointed out that there seems to be a strong correlation

353
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:43,680
between some of the founding postmodernists and, shall we say, well, yeah, depraved sexual

354
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:48,080
activity, sometimes pedophilia, these kinds of things. The question, I suppose,

355
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,280
are you suggesting that they created this kind of theoretical framework in order to justify

356
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,320
that sort of behavior? Is that what you mean?

357
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:03,760
Well, you see, I waver and maybe the causality is interactive because you could see,

358
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:10,080
I see a lot of stunningly immature behavior on the radical front from a developmental

359
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,440
psychological perspective. So, for example, a lot of the behavior I see looks to me like

360
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:21,440
unsocialized two-year-old behavior, because two-year-olds are highly prone to motivational

361
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,960
and emotional whims in the short term, and they're incapable of developing a shared frame of

362
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:32,640
reference. That doesn't happen till kids are three. And aggressive two-year-olds who don't

363
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,840
develop that by four never develop it in their entire life because they become alienated and

364
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:44,560
they don't make friends and they can't further their development. And so you could say, if this is

365
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:50,640
sort of a Freudian id-like view, that part of what we're seeing is the expression of extremely

366
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:58,000
unsocialized, immature, motivational and emotional demands fragmented with a, what would you say,

367
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,800
temper tantrum-like insistence, constant insistence that those whims be granted

368
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:11,520
immediately. And then you could say, well, the entire power critique has been erected by,

369
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,960
on the intellectual front, just to justify that. Although you could also reverse it and say, no,

370
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,680
the licentiousness, which was the case you were making, the licentiousness is promoted because

371
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,680
it's revolutionary in a sense, and it can be used to demolish these so-called traditional power

372
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:32,240
structures. Well, it has to be because they just have so many impositions on other people's freedoms.

373
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,760
They have so many ideas of what is acceptable and what is not acceptable, particularly in the arts,

374
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,560
in film, in plays, in books, that, you know, they're for censorship. They believe that things that are,

375
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,400
that horrible word, they use problematic and they like to problematize things.

376
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,640
So it can't be the case that they just believe in a kind of global free-for-all.

377
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:56,160
It can't be that because I think they come across more like Pharisees to me than anything else.

378
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,840
But maybe what you're describing in terms of the temper tantrums and the things that we see

379
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,760
from these people is that that is just simply the natural consequence of when you have decades

380
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,480
of academics and figures of authority saying that we ought to prioritize our emotional responses

381
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,320
and our own subjective view of the world over objective epistemological frameworks.

382
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,920
Or actual practical responsibility. I mean, I saw this at the University of Toronto. It was

383
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,920
one of the things that constantly made me morally ill was that my idiot compatriots thought that the

384
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,240
best thing to do with young people was to teach them to protest rather than to help them figure

385
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,120
out how to make their way responsibly and productively and generously in the world.

386
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,200
They've created a generation that are infantile. I mean, it is an infantilized world and we see it

387
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,160
in absolutely every strand of our culture and politics as well. And it's because, as you say,

388
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:56,400
academics, by and large, are activists first and academics second. Helen Pluckrose traces

389
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,680
that to what she calls the applied turn of postmodernism, late 80s. Postmodernists for many

390
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:07,040
years were quite enjoyed theorizing and frolicking about coming up with these airy fairy ideas,

391
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,320
not applying them to society, not seriously saying we should reconstruct society and apply

392
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:19,520
these methods. And then the applied postmodernist said, actually, we can actually change society,

393
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:25,280
revolutionize society through the application of our untested theories and highly contested theories.

394
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:33,280
And they did it. And what's so tragic is that it eventually worked. We're now in a situation where

395
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,760
our government over here, the government certainly in Canada and in the US,

396
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:44,400
they are implementing these ideas, these highly contested theories in public policy,

397
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,600
in the educational sense. Yes, they're making the mandatory. Well, that was what propelled me

398
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,840
into the public domain to begin with, was the first move of that sort on the Trudeau Liberal

399
00:36:53,840 --> 00:37:00,480
Government Front, right, mandated speech. But that's why surely it does merit the analogy with

400
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:10,800
religion, because you are imposing on society ideas that are based on belief, simply based on

401
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:17,600
belief. You know, there is no evidence that reorganizing society in the way that the critical

402
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:23,600
race theories would like to do, so that we have a hyper racialized society that focuses first and

403
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,240
foremost on your group of identity and secondarily on who you are as an individual. There's no

404
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:35,200
evidence that this is making society less racist. So we seem to have agreed that

405
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:45,360
the desire for demolition and destruction rules paramount even over the desire for untrammeled

406
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:54,480
personal self-expression. I think that is inevitable when you come from the supposition

407
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:00,400
that society is inherently broken, that it is undergirded by power structures that only

408
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:07,520
support the already privileged. Okay, so let's dive into that, because this is a good place to

409
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,960
further interrogate the left issues. So, you know, a lot of the people that I talk with,

410
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,480
Russell Brown and Joe Rogan, Brett Weinstein, those are good, Eric Weinstein, those are good

411
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:28,640
initial exemplars, are more classical leftist types, and yet they're identified by the screaming

412
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,840
radicals as gateways to the old right, which is extraordinarily interesting, because it means as

413
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:39,920
soon as you're no longer a useful idiot from the radical perspective, you're instantly a Nazi,

414
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:51,360
which is very convenient for them. But here's the thing. The postmodern critique that society

415
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:59,040
is to be understood as nothing but the manifestation of power is attractive, partly because when

416
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:06,640
social arrangements or even psychological arrangements pathologize, they do pathologize in

417
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:14,000
the direction of power, right? So, if you're, you can tyrannize yourself like an overlord,

418
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,080
you can tyrannize your partner, you can tyrannize your family and your community,

419
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:25,280
you can act like a tyrant on the local political stage, and then nationally, right?

420
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:31,120
You can do that in business as well. And so, and that happens relatively often. So,

421
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:39,840
there's a core of sense in the claim that power is a powerful motivating force. Now,

422
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:46,480
I think the radicals go too far when they say everything is about power because, well, everything

423
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,160
is a lot of things, and you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. But the problem,

424
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:58,480
the problem the left therefore has, if the left is willing to be reasonable and say, well, some

425
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,400
social structures are corrupted by power, then the left has to figure out, and can't,

426
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:11,680
because I've asked like 50 senators and Republican and congressmen on the Democrat side to do this.

427
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:19,760
If your leftist stance is that power corrupts society, then how in the world can you tell

428
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,840
when those who make that claim take that claim too far? And I've asked, like the reason I brought

429
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:31,840
up the Democrat, the senators and congressmen is because I asked every lefty I could get my hands

430
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:37,920
on, and that's been quite a few over the last five years, when the left goes too far. And I even

431
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,480
asked Robert Kennedy that recently, and he said, well, I'm trying to run a campaign based on unity,

432
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,520
and so I don't want to go down that rabbit hole. It's like, well, the barbarians are at your gate,

433
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:53,280
buddy. They've been canceling you for 18 years. So, how do we separate out this?

434
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,240
Well, there are so many things that you've raised there. I mean, firstly,

435
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,480
you're right to identify that there is a kernel in truth of truth in the postmodernist claims,

436
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:06,080
that power is important. It is significant in human behavior and society and history. All of that,

437
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:10,800
that is absolutely accurate. And you're also right that where they go wrong is to assume that

438
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,640
everything is about power. Like you say, power is really important, but it's not everything.

439
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:21,520
And I wonder whether reducing everything to just power structures makes things

440
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,240
understandable, easier in a way. Yeah, well, we found the best predictor. In our first study,

441
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,960
the best predictor of left-wing authoritarianism was low verbal intelligence.

442
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:39,280
Right, because people want easy answers. Absolutely. Power is a good easy answer,

443
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:46,080
right? Any ideology is because it means that you're outsourcing your thinking to a set of rules,

444
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:51,040
and that is what is happening. But that's why all those people that you've tried to ask this

445
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,000
question, what happens when the left goes too far in terms of their own megalomania?

446
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,520
They won't answer the question because to do so would be to acknowledge that there is a flaw

447
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,880
in their ideology. There's a potential flaw in their system, that they're dealing ultimately

448
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:09,600
with human beings. It's the same reason why the Stalinists have never forgiven Orwell.

449
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,680
All these people on the left have always hated him for pointing out that the left is just as

450
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,880
susceptible to corruption as the right is, and they've never forgiven him for that.

451
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,880
And it comes down to that idea of moral purity. I mean, one of the reasons I call them the

452
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,600
new Puritans. Again, it's an analogy. It's trying to make them accessible. It's because in their

453
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:30,640
world, to deviate even slightly from this very simplistic formula that they've applied to society,

454
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:37,760
to give them power, ironically enough, to put them in a position where they can control other people,

455
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,880
but also can control their own understandings and comprehensions of the world, because they've

456
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,680
got this framework through which they can look at it. And to say, well, actually, your framework

457
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,360
is flawed in all sorts of ways, that's harder because then you have to start thinking. And they

458
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:57,600
don't want to start thinking. Thinking is the death of ideology. I think that's why you're

459
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,960
getting that moral purity, but it's also why. I mean, you mentioned, interestingly,

460
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,880
people like Joe Rogan and Russell Brown being considered a gateway to the alt-right. They're

461
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:12,960
still traditionally politically more akin to the left, I would say, than the right.

462
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,280
But because they've deviated slightly, you have this kind of puritanical sledgehammer

463
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:24,240
coming down and saying, no, you're straying from what our ideology says you should believe.

464
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:31,200
And that, to me, also feels like a fundamentalist religion. And I'm making the distinction clearly

465
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,880
between a religion and a fundamentalist religion, because I think even within Catholicism,

466
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,800
the Vatican has always encouraged debate, theological debate and discussion. It's not as

467
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,240
though they just give you the catechism and say, that's it. There's all these kinds of discussions

468
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,880
and debates and nuances being teased out in theological thoughts. Theologians for centuries

469
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,000
have done that. But with fundamentalist religion, that doesn't happen. It doesn't happen with ISIS,

470
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,400
for instance. You don't get the sort of leaders of ISIS sitting around cross-legged in their caves

471
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,480
saying, well, let's decide whether we're right about this fine theological point.

472
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,120
That doesn't happen. So what scares me, I think, about the critical social justice movement,

473
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:12,160
is that they are like a fundamentalist religion for some reason. I mean, this is why, and you know

474
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,320
this, whenever you meet one of these people, whenever you encounter them online, get into

475
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,440
some kind of discussion, you know what their opinions are and absolutely everything.

476
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,800
Yes, yes, yes. Like turning a crank on someone's head.

477
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:28,560
I've never been surprised by them. I'd like to be surprised once in a while. I've had a few

478
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,320
occasions recently where I've gotten to conversa... You know, I fall for it. You should just block

479
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,520
them, really, because they're not people who can be reasoned with. But every now and then,

480
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:40,480
I take the bait and I say, okay, what is it you think I've said? What is upset you? What is the

481
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:45,680
perspective that I have that you disagree with and why? And they can't do it. They just come back

482
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,800
screaming Nazi or whatever, and then you think, okay, well, I shouldn't have bothered trying.

483
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,560
But they never surprised me. I just wish they would, because if you're not thinking for yourself

484
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,880
and challenging your own ideas, if you're not coming from the basis, from humility, if you're

485
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,720
not coming to the world on the understanding that you're probably wrong about an awful lot of things,

486
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,280
I don't think you're fully human in a way. I think you're like an automaton. You know, you're just,

487
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,640
you're just following a code, a script. You're possessed by a principality.

488
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:22,160
Right. I find that disturbing. Okay, so let me hassle you about something else. I tweeted out

489
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:30,000
at Richard Dawkins here recently, and I talked to Richard Dawkins, and I actually admire Richard

490
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,760
Dawkins. I liked his books. They taught me a lot in some of his essays, too. And I think Dawkins

491
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:41,760
is a real scientist in that he believes there is truth and that the pursuit of the truth will set

492
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,920
you free, which by the way is a religious claim, but he still believes that. In any case, I also

493
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:54,960
think that Dawkins and Harris and the rest of the new atheists help pave the landscape for this new

494
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:00,480
woke catastrophe, because it's a humanistic movement fundamentally, and it's radically

495
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,800
anti-science. And I think that Dawkins, well, I know Dawkins sees that because I've been watching

496
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,760
his tweets, and I didn't talk to him. And it's certainly the case that the woke mob, I think,

497
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:16,320
can take out science even more easily than they can take out the vestiges of Judeo-Christian thought,

498
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:22,880
and they're definitely going to do that. So now Dawkins and his coterie looked at

499
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:28,320
the history of the West, and they said, well, we should dispense with that medieval superstition,

500
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,320
and we should progress down the Enlightenment trail. And I've talked to Douglas Murray about this.

501
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,640
Now, the problem with that, it seems to me, so Jung said something very interesting as well

502
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:47,200
that I'll bring up. He implied that Catholicism, with all its strange mysticism and dream-like

503
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:55,760
propositional structure, was as sane as people got, like that in order for people to

504
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:01,920
function psychologically and to exist together socially, the belief system that united them

505
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:08,960
had to have a dream-like quality. Okay, so and that now the new atheist types would say, well,

506
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:15,920
no, no, no, we can replace all that mumbo jumbo and darkness and occult mysticism with a clear-headed

507
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,800
rationality. But what I see happening instead, and this is on the religious front, is that

508
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:27,280
in the aftermath of the death of God, what we've seen reemerge is either a form of worship of power

509
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:33,920
or degeneration into a kind of polytheistic paganism, not a move forward to Enlightenment-type

510
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:41,120
Dawkins rationality. Quite the contrary. And so one of the things I'm curious, I know Murray is

511
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:47,920
uncomfortable about this. Douglas Murray is uncomfortable about this. If the woke movement

512
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:54,480
is a religion, and if it's a dangerous religion, is the alternative to that no religion, or is

513
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,600
the alternative to that whatever might constitute genuine religion? And what do you think about

514
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:05,680
that? Well, I think there is clearly something within humanity that we require a certain

515
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:11,120
satisfaction from some kind of belief system, which is outside of ourselves or a sense that

516
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,960
there is something beyond ourselves. I suppose you might call it transcendence. I think there is

517
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:22,240
a need for that. I think that I get that through the arts. I think that's why we create things.

518
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:28,480
That's why we are creative beings, which is also why I think the woke movement is threatened by the

519
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:35,040
arts and seeks to curtail it and actually to transform it into just another propagandising tool,

520
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:41,520
because it fundamentally doesn't understand what art is. So it is interesting to me though

521
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,400
to have noted that the new atheist movement, the one that you describe,

522
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:50,560
they seem now to have evolved into the most woke of all, the humanist society.

523
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:57,120
Yeah, there's something about them that they bought into gender identity ideology very quickly,

524
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:02,960
probably before other bodies did. And the humanist society in the UK now is fully paid up in that

525
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:09,840
really quasi-religious belief system, the idea of a sexed or gendered soul that doesn't match your

526
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:16,320
biological form. How is that anything other than religious? How is it anything other than

527
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:22,160
supernatural, really? But it has been interesting to me that those were the very people,

528
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:28,320
the people who were talking about rationality and to sort of claw back the primacy of enlightenment

529
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:32,000
values, that they are the ones who've been most susceptible of all. Of course, this is what has

530
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:40,080
got Dawkins in trouble. That's a stunningly devastating observation, because if it turns out

531
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:46,240
that those who wanted to walk down the mass enlightenment pathway, produce children who

532
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:52,960
were most susceptible to woke ideology, that's a pretty damning bit of evidence for the validity

533
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:59,840
of that approach. As far as I mean, I'm trying to look at it. Well, because it's always concerned

534
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:04,640
me that some of my most intelligent friends and acquaintances have fallen for the woke

535
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:09,760
movement. In other words, you talk about the fact that a lot of the activists are very

536
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,880
infantile in their behavior, and yet some of the smartest people in society seem to buy into it.

537
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:22,240
It has the capacity to infect everyone, perhaps because it isn't responsive to intellectual

538
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:29,600
rigor. It exists regardless of that. Right, but then that begs the question of why it attracts

539
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:34,560
the intelligent types that you're describing. I mean, look, it originated in the Bloody Academy.

540
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:39,440
It didn't originate. Hypothetically, it originated not only in the academy, but

541
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,880
in the core of the academy that was most preoccupied with the humanities.

542
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,040
It obviously appeals to the intellect, let's say.

543
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:58,400
Or is it just that we're all, we all have the capacity to fall for hysteria? Is it possible

544
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:04,880
that we're just all, I mean, look, my book opens with a discussion of Salem, The Witch Hunts in

545
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:10,480
Salem. And one of the key things about that, the more I read about it, and the more I was

546
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,800
fascinated by the fact that it was these figures in authority, it was the ministers, the judges,

547
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:19,040
it was the highly intelligent in the community who were the ones who were pushing this. I mean,

548
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,720
the girls were screaming and crying witch and pointing and saying that the devil was everywhere,

549
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,880
and they'd seen people sign the devil's book and all of that kind of thing. I see those girls as

550
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,760
analogous with the screaming anime activists online who just shout Nazi everywhere. They see

551
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,960
Nazis everywhere. The girls saw witches everywhere. I see that as very, very similar. But it would

552
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,280
have gone away if the ministers and the judges said, no, this isn't rational. You're wrong.

553
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,960
There's no evidence for your claims. We have to move on. But they didn't. They went along with it.

554
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:52,320
That's why people ended up being executed. It's when figures in authority capitulate

555
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:57,040
to the screaming of the children. You've described the children, the activist has children.

556
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,440
The activists themselves, I would posit, are not the problem. If they were all out there with

557
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:07,120
their billboards screaming. It's the enablers. It's the politicians and people in charge.

558
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:15,760
So one of the things you see as the biblical corpus unfolds itself symbolically is an emerging

559
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:22,720
relationship between the figure of Cain. And so that's that bitter figure who's out for revenge

560
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:27,920
and the figure of the, what would you call it, untrammeled intellect. So for example,

561
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,960
very rapidly after the Cain and Abel story, you have the story of the Tower of Babel.

562
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:40,480
And what you see there are emperors who are competing to replace God, right? They're building

563
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:46,720
towers that are ever and ever higher predicated on the proposition that they could build a tower

564
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:52,080
all the way to heaven. So that's like Jacob's ladder and thereby replace God. Then you have,

565
00:52:52,080 --> 00:53:00,000
you know, the Milton's meditations on Lucifer. Lucifer is the, what the highest angel of God's

566
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,480
heavenly kingdom who's gone most wrong. And he's a stellar example of the, of the untrammeled intellect.

567
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:12,000
You know, and I kind of see this in the New Atheist movement too. It's like, we're so smart

568
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:18,880
that our theories can replace the transcendent. Now, your way out of that, I think you just

569
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:24,960
told me, your way out of that is your involvement on the aesthetic front with the arts, right?

570
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:30,640
Well, I think so. Well, there are two, there are two ways. There's also humility. I think,

571
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:36,160
I come back to that point. What you're describing is hubris and that's something which is,

572
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,760
which is common, particularly common among intelligent people, I think.

573
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,240
Right, right. Absolutely. It's the cardinal sin of the intellect is hubris.

574
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:54,880
Yes, exactly. But yes, the arts, I think are, I suppose, are way out if they are sustained

575
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:01,920
because they, they satisfying that human need to, to understand ourselves and to explore

576
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:08,800
ourselves and to interrogate our existence. It's so important, therefore, that the arts

577
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,040
aren't curtailed in the way that they currently are being done.

578
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:16,160
So let me ask you a question about that. I agree with that. I mean, I see that the signal power

579
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:22,320
of beauty, especially manifested in music, for me, speaks of something that's truly transcendent.

580
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:31,040
So here's a question for you. So is there a superordinate unity at which the arts aim?

581
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:39,040
And is that unity not equivalent to the monotheistic spirit? I know this is a major question,

582
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,040
right? I'm not, I'm throwing out a major question.

583
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:41,760
It is a major question.

584
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:47,200
Something makes the arts the arts, right? It's their movement towards beauty. What beauty and

585
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:54,000
unity, transcendence, but are the arts unified? Are they, are they the manifestation of a unitary

586
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,480
spirit? And I see that unitary spirit is what I think is the antithesis of power.

587
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:03,680
I couldn't profess to know. And I think a lot of people have attempted to define even what

588
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:09,840
art is. And I think people have failed. I've always liked Zola's definition of art as

589
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:17,280
life seen through a temperament. The idea that what the artist does is attempt to present to you

590
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:24,080
his view of the way that he sees the world on the understanding that we all see the world differently.

591
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:29,600
And there is something quite beautiful about that, about expressing ourselves artistically.

592
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:34,480
But it's not just variety. You know, you know, it's not just variety because there are qualitative

593
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:42,240
distinctions between presentations of worldview. So I mean, Dostoevsky, Trump's 50 Shades of Gray,

594
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:48,880
right? Because so there's a hierarchy of rank, right? And the greatest artists occupy the highest

595
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:54,160
rank. And that is what tilts the more towards that transcendent unity, I think. It's something

596
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:59,600
like that. Well, well, yeah, that's absolutely right. It's genius, isn't it? That's how the

597
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,680
canon is formed. I mean, the canon is, you know, I think academics like to think that they're the

598
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:08,880
ones who select what is in the canon. The canon is formed through influence, through to what extent

599
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:15,760
other great artists borrow and innovate on the back of other artists. That's that same depth of

600
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:20,720
presupposition that I was describing earlier, right? The more fundamental a text is, the more

601
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:25,360
other texts depend on it. But the reason they do, the reason that artists do that is because obviously

602
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:33,520
people like Michelangelo, Brahms, Dickens, Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, all of these are clearly

603
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,840
the pinnacles of human achievement. They're achieving something that most of us simply cannot do.

604
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:42,800
All we can do is look in awe at what they have achieved and other artists look in awe at that

605
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:47,760
and try to come close to it, or at least, or in some cases of extreme genius build upon it.

606
00:56:48,160 --> 00:57:00,480
Well, there's a cardinal observation, because the hypothesis that you just put forward is something

607
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:08,880
like the purpose of art is to, what would you say, to provoke the emulation of greatness.

608
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:14,160
And that's based on the hypothesis that there is something transcendent that's great,

609
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,880
you know? And that's that unity that I think that the arts are striving toward.

610
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,480
Yeah, well, I don't know. I don't think it's conscious like that. I don't think that we...

611
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,920
I don't think so either.

612
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:31,840
And all I can say is that artists, I think, great art provokes something of the numinous

613
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:37,840
in us. And whether that's religious or spiritual or godly or whatever, I don't know.

614
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,280
But it's something that...

615
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,960
Well, I think it is sort of by definition, right? I mean, you know what I mean?

616
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,720
It's like, well, if that's not religious, then what is dogma?

617
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,120
It's certainly religious on the experiential front.

618
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:53,120
Yes, I suppose what I mean is it doesn't point to the existence of God necessarily.

619
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:58,080
It just points to the existence of something beyond ourselves that we require in order to

620
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,280
have a satisfactory life.

621
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,760
That sounds a lot like God.

622
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,840
Okay, well, that would be...

623
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,560
Well, I'm not trying to be picky, you know?

624
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,600
Well, that's the thing, man, because it is a matter of definition.

625
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:14,160
You know, like, I don't think God...

626
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:21,120
This transcendent unity that I've been tapping towards here is something like

627
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,120
the central animating spirit of mankind at its best.

628
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,720
It's something like that.

629
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,800
Now, you might say, well, is that real?

630
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:32,800
And that's not a good question because you have...

631
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:37,120
You can't ask that question without bringing an a priori set of presuppositions about what

632
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,600
constitutes real to bear on the question.

633
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:43,920
Like, is it the same reality as the materialist atheists claim most real?

634
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,440
Probably not.

635
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:46,820
No.

636
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,400
But that doesn't mean it's not real.

637
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,720
It just means we can't agree on what constitutes real.

638
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:54,000
Well, we can't agree on what constitutes a woman, so that's not surprising.

639
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,920
Well, then let's suggest then that...

640
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:01,840
Oh, let's agree that the critical social justice movement is essentially godless.

641
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,520
I think it is godless.

642
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,400
It doesn't have...

643
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,320
It has no yearning after that sense of the numinous,

644
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,640
and it has no capacity to produce it.

645
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:14,320
That's why no great art has ever been produced from...

646
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:19,760
Can you name a single woke activist who has produced a great work of art in any

647
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,200
medium or any genre?

648
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,320
Because I can't.

649
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:22,720
I don't think...

650
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,880
Okay, so that's an interesting...

651
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,560
That's a very interesting observation.

652
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,360
You know, what is it?

653
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:30,400
The gospel statement, by their fruits, you will know them.

654
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,400
So if they bear nothing but bitter fruit,

655
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:37,440
then you might think they're worshiping the wrong god, or in your case, they're no god.

656
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,720
But right, that was the criticism of the woke types.

657
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:44,240
I think they worship power as a god, but whatever, we're close enough on that,

658
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,440
so we don't have to discuss it.

659
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:51,200
So let's talk about the artistic front here, because I see the scientists being mowed down

660
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:55,280
like grass under a lawnmower by the woke activists, and that's going to continue,

661
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,080
because the real scientists don't have a political bone in their body,

662
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,080
and they have no idea what's coming for them.

663
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:04,880
But I'm particularly sickened by the bloody artists, because the only thing they have to

664
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,240
offer is this connection to the truly numinous.

665
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,000
That's true across art forms, right?

666
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,360
They point to the numinous, and they're willing, increasingly,

667
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:17,920
to subordinate that to ideology order, remain silent in the face of this onslaught,

668
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,960
to bolster their moral self-righteousness.

669
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:21,520
Yeah, that's really different for us.

670
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,120
They're cutting their own throats.

671
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,080
It's horrible to watch.

672
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:28,560
It's horrible to witness, because genius, artistic genius, can only come about by those

673
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:34,480
who can think outside the box, who are not conformists, ultimately.

674
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,720
This is a movement that demands conformity, and artists of all people are the ones

675
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:39,520
who are going along with it.

676
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,760
Now, to an extent, I suppose, that's always happened, though.

677
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,160
I mean, it must have always happened, because people, artists,

678
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,520
have to get on with the business of living.

679
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:50,720
Back in my renaissance period, the area that I studied from my doctorate,

680
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,560
you had patrons.

681
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,520
You had patrons of the arts in society who would effectively say,

682
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,120
to William Shakespeare, for instance, when King James patronized William Shakespeare's

683
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:02,240
company, the King's Men, it went from being the Lord Chamberlain's Men to the King's Men,

684
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:07,280
and he said, they were patronized, but Shakespeare could write whatever he wanted.

685
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,240
The great patrons are the ones who don't try to steer the artists in a certain way.

686
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:16,640
I mean, sure, you would get, for instance, at the start of Shakespeare's narrative poem,

687
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:24,640
Venus and Adonis, you have this sort of sycophantic passage about the person to whom it is dedicated,

688
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:30,880
Henry Ruthsley, the Earl, and that's because Shakespeare also needed to live at that point.

689
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,560
He wasn't yet a rich man at that point.

690
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:36,080
He became very, very rich ultimately, but at that point, he wasn't.

691
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:45,360
So artists do require an income, and in our day and age, in order for an artist to be employed,

692
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:49,600
they have to satisfy a set of demands by the gatekeepers of various industries.

693
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:56,400
That's theatre, the publishing industry, comedy industry, television, executives, commissioners,

694
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,360
all of those kind of things.

695
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:03,200
The problem is that at the moment, all of those people are entirely captured by the woke ideology.

696
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:08,560
They are all, it's foot soldiers, or at least even in some cases, I suppose you could call them,

697
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,280
it's clergy.

698
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:12,240
And so they make these demands to artists.

699
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:17,680
And I suppose, unless you are independently wealthy, what choice have you?

700
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:23,840
In other words, what this thing does is we can't all be a van Gogh living in complete poverty,

701
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,120
doing whatever the hell he wanted.

702
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:31,280
Well, that's a very sympathetic account, and I have some sympathy for that account,

703
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:37,920
because I've seen people, many, many people who've faced the threat of cancellation

704
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:43,280
and are terrified by it, not least often because they have a family to support, let's say.

705
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:48,400
But let me push back on that a little bit.

706
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,880
And you tell me if you think there's any flaws in this.

707
01:02:50,880 --> 01:03:02,400
Okay, so look, as far as I can tell, your best bet in life is to play the most transcendent,

708
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,680
iterable strategy.

709
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:07,920
And because you're going to pay a price for what you do, no matter what you do.

710
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,440
You're going to pay, in fact, you're going to pay the ultimate price, no matter what you do.

711
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,920
So you're already screwed in the fundamental analysis.

712
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:19,840
Now, and that means that you're, the fact that you're going to pay means that you're always

713
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,120
confronted with a choice.

714
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:26,240
And the choice is to say what you believe to be true and take the consequences,

715
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:30,400
or to fail to say what you believe to be true and take the consequences.

716
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:36,640
Now, people will say, well, I don't want to speak right now because look at the consequences.

717
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:39,920
And I would say, well, that's always why people have lied throughout history,

718
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,520
is to avoid the consequences or to get something they don't deserve.

719
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:48,640
And so I could say, from the judgment perspective, rather than the mercy perspective,

720
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:53,120
especially to artists, it's like, I don't give a damn about your financial need.

721
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:57,680
The only thing you have to offer the world is the purity of your vision.

722
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:02,000
And if you sacrifice that while you're killing the goose that lays the golden eggs,

723
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,400
and you might be protected in the short term, but they're going to come for you in the future.

724
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,800
There may be a lot of these creative people are thinking to themselves,

725
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,560
I will play the game as far as I need to, so that I can establish myself,

726
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,560
and then I can make my own artistic choices.

727
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,680
That's how many times- Yeah, right.

728
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:18,080
Doesn't work. That's what the faculty did.

729
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:22,720
They said over and over as they rose up the ladder from graduate student to professor.

730
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:26,000
Well, once I have tenure, I'll be brave.

731
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,680
It's like, that isn't how it works.

732
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,920
You don't get braver because you're more pretentious.

733
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,760
Okay, so you didn't do that, so why didn't you do it?

734
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:40,000
Look, I completely share your sense of dismay, and particularly from artists.

735
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,120
You know, I think the world of academia is rather more careerist, I think.

736
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:49,760
And so, although I think it's just as unforgivable, it's more understandable.

737
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:56,480
I think to be an artist, you have to be the kind of person whose soul fealty is to your muse.

738
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,360
It has to be that.

739
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:00,160
Otherwise, you're not really an artist in any serious sense at all.

740
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:05,040
You have to be creating what it is you are personally impelled to create, whatever drives you.

741
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,280
And you know, there are some people who have done that in history.

742
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:15,040
William Blake was poor throughout his life, died in poverty,

743
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:20,080
and he could see all these mediocre people playing the game and becoming rich,

744
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,600
but he couldn't do it.

745
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,360
He was too much of an authentic artist.

746
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:25,920
He wasn't able to do that.

747
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,880
And I wish all artists could have that.

748
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:33,280
But the other thing about that is actually very few people are great artists.

749
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:39,360
Most people are sort of peddlers of popular culture or, you know, kind of functional hacks

750
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:43,920
that people can produce the entertainment that actually we do really need and require.

751
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,840
Like, I'm not trying to denigrate popular culture.

752
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:46,960
I think it's really, really important.

753
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,440
But it's not the same as great art, right?

754
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:55,440
So pop music, I really enjoy pop music, but I don't pretend to myself that it's Brahms.

755
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,920
You know, we have those hierarchies.

756
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,400
Hierarchies, by the way, which the woke would like to tear down and say,

757
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,800
that's all about the implementation of power again and the implement implementation of privilege.

758
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,200
They will say there's no difference between a...

759
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,800
There's no such thing as quality.

760
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,960
No, no, no, exactly, exactly.

761
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,480
Because it's all about subjective feeling.

762
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:17,040
And they would say that there's no difference between an Elton John song and a Beethoven symphony.

763
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,160
They'll say there's no difference there.

764
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:22,400
It's just about, you know, and to pretend that there is is a problem in and of itself.

765
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,720
And that's why I think there are two things.

766
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,840
The way that artists could really be supported in this

767
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,560
partly comes from academia, partly comes from literary theorists

768
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:35,440
and people who, by the way, I think have completely lost the plot.

769
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:39,200
But they need to retain the primacy of the canon, of the Western canon.

770
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:44,480
They need to say, actually, there are certain works of art that are greater than others.

771
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,960
They need to be able to be bold enough to say that.

772
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:54,400
Rather than stripping away Chaucer or Shakespeare or Marlowe or whatever from the canon

773
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:59,600
to make way for mediocre writers who happen to represent a marginalized group identity.

774
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:06,000
Well, I see in that, again, this re-emergence of the spirit of Cain.

775
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,560
Because Cain, imagine you're a mediocre artist, want to be.

776
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:14,080
And part of the reason for that maybe isn't so much that you're talentless,

777
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:15,680
although that might have something to do with it,

778
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:20,080
but that you're unwilling to say a true word or to paint a true brush stroke.

779
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,480
You're too cowardly, so you're not going anywhere.

780
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:25,600
Okay, so you're getting irritated and resentful

781
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,640
because your sacrifices aren't being appreciated by God.

782
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,240
And so what do you do?

783
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:33,680
Well, if you're Cain, you destroy your own ideal, right?

784
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,480
Because that's what Cain says to God,

785
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,320
my punishment is more than I can bear.

786
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,880
Now, that's a very ambiguous phrase,

787
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,960
because you can't tell exactly what it refers to.

788
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,520
But as far as I can tell, what he means is,

789
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:50,640
well, I've really spent my whole life miserable and jealous because I'm not able,

790
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,760
and I want to be more than anything else.

791
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,560
And now I've gone and killed my own ideal.

792
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:00,240
And so how can I live? I've killed my own ideal.

793
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:05,120
Well, that's what these bloody woke artists want to be types are doing.

794
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,520
It's not just even the woke, this predates the woke.

795
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:11,440
Harold Bloom used to, the great literary theorist used to write about

796
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:15,040
the critical theorists, the identitarian theorists of the 90s

797
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:17,200
as being the theorists of resentment.

798
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,560
That's what he called them.

799
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,640
I think that's exactly right.

800
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,720
It started way back in the 60s with feminist writers trying to problematize

801
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:28,480
writers such as D.H. Lawrence or Norman Mail or whoever it might be,

802
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:32,240
Ernest Hemingway, whatever, saying that these writers are sexist.

803
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:35,600
I mean, when I was studying as an undergraduate for English literature,

804
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:39,120
you basically got the highest marks if you problematized texts.

805
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:43,760
If you went through a play and teased out the homophobic elements or the racist elements,

806
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:46,880
you'd get rewarded almost like you were kind of a kind of moral detective.

807
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:48,800
And I think it all started there.

808
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:49,840
It goes way back to the past.

809
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:52,480
Well, so then I would say that's part of the

810
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,360
prideful hubris of the intellect.

811
01:08:55,360 --> 01:09:00,480
So you have these second rate creative wannabes in English departments, let's say.

812
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:04,000
And instead of worshiping the spirit of Shakespeare,

813
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,280
which is what they should properly be doing and transmitting that to students,

814
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:12,640
they elevate their critical capacity over and above the creative capacity of the artist,

815
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:16,160
lay moral claim to the integrity of their arguments,

816
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:21,600
and then propagandize to the students who pay $50,000 a year for the privilege.

817
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,960
Which is why I go back to humility, because I think the only sensible

818
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,720
or intelligent approach to Shakespeare is humility.

819
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:31,200
Similarly, you know, when we saw recently the publishing house,

820
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:35,520
which publishing house was it that decided to rewrite P.G. Woodhouse's novels?

821
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:39,360
P.G. Woodhouse is the greatest comic prose stylist in the English language.

822
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:45,200
The idea that a group of 20-something activists in a publishing house think that

823
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,040
they can write better than Woodhouse,

824
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:51,120
think that they can improve his work by this sort of horrendous, bolderized version.

825
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,160
Especially morally.

826
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,120
Of course morally, it's all based on morals.

827
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,360
So it's so infuriating.

828
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:01,120
I mean, it makes me very, very angry because it's the arrogance of that

829
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:04,240
that I find absolutely stunning.

830
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,480
But similarly with productions of Shakespeare, so there's...

831
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,840
I just saw a review the other day for a production of Julius Caesar

832
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,440
by the Royal Shakespeare Company.

833
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,920
By all accounts, it's just an identitarian mess.

834
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:21,120
It's just taking the play and just reshaping it to promote

835
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:24,880
vogue-ish ideas that are in fashion at the moment

836
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:28,640
about group identity and the primacy of group identity and power structures, etc.

837
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,720
And therefore they're missing the entire play.

838
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:35,200
And as an audience member, this is why I think it's better to read Shakespeare at this point.

839
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:41,120
Because as an audience member, you are subject to whatever interpretation

840
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,720
the director wants to impose on it.

841
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:46,000
And if that director is really a preacher in disguise,

842
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,320
then you're just going to get a sermon, not a play.

843
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,040
That seems to me what's happening over and over again.

844
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:54,480
I saw today, actually, there was an article about Macbeth.

845
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:57,840
Trigger warning.

846
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,400
It's a trigger warning on Macbeth at the University in Belfast,

847
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,400
at Queen's University in Belfast, right?

848
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:05,680
Now, those people are studying a module on Shakespeare.

849
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,360
And it's actually even a secondary module.

850
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:10,160
They already have a decent knowledge of the subject.

851
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:16,400
This is like an advanced module where they are to really get into the weeds with this great writer.

852
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,960
And to put a trigger warning in that is to say

853
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,280
that the way that we need to perceive these great texts

854
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:27,600
is through our particularly obsessive, moralistic,

855
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:31,920
identitarian lens, and that we have to see them as morally dangerous texts,

856
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,760
potentially dangerous texts, toxicity.

857
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,160
Maybe they're exactly right on that front.

858
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:38,240
Because if you are a woke propagandist,

859
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:41,600
there is nothing more dangerous to you than the spirit of Shakespeare.

860
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,600
Sure. And there is something dangerous, actually,

861
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,720
particularly about Macbeth, I think, because in Macbeth,

862
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:50,160
I mean, I think Macbeth is one of Shakespeare's greatest plays.

863
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:53,120
And I think one of the reasons why I always found it disturbing,

864
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:56,400
even as a child, even though I didn't really know why I found it disturbing as a child,

865
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,240
because it's one of those that gets on school text,

866
01:11:58,240 --> 01:11:59,280
because it's such a short one.

867
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,800
But actually, when you watch it, it isn't like you're...

868
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:08,880
Shakespeare created so many great embodiments of evil,

869
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,480
people like Yago in Othello, or Edmund in King Lear,

870
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,640
or Aaron in Titus Andronicus, these figures.

871
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,680
But Macbeth is different, because with Macbeth,

872
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:22,800
you go along with Macbeth knowing that it could be you.

873
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,320
I think it's the closest to what...

874
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:27,440
When you write about Solzhenitsyn talking about

875
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:30,080
the line of good and evil cutting through the heart of every man,

876
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,520
that to me is Macbeth.

877
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:36,080
Because Macbeth is like this incredible representation of,

878
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,240
what if we lived in a world where we didn't have free will?

879
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,360
Macbeth knows everything he is doing is wrong,

880
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,880
and cannot stop it from happening.

881
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,760
And it's like when you're watching it,

882
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,440
if you're watching a good production of Macbeth,

883
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,400
you are Macbeth, right?

884
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,160
And you're falling into this vortex.

885
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:54,480
That's why I think...

886
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,080
Well, that's actually like a definition of great literature.

887
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:02,640
I think literature almost always portrays something like

888
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:06,240
a romantic adventure, and then something like

889
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:08,000
the battle of good against evil,

890
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,240
depending on how that's laid out, right?

891
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:12,480
It's a romantic battle of good against evil.

892
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:16,720
Okay, but the great literary authors

893
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:21,040
place that battle in the soul of a single individual, right?

894
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:24,640
So that each character contains the entire landscape

895
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:25,760
of the cosmic battle.

896
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,120
Instead of there being some characters parsed out as good,

897
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,600
and other characters parsed out as villainous.

898
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,000
And so then when you sit in the audience,

899
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,640
and you experience that,

900
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:40,000
you're experiencing the divine drama in your own soul.

901
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,160
Yeah, and that is distilting, right?

902
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:44,080
Let me throw you something at you.

903
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:48,800
So I went to Jerusalem with Jonathan Pazio,

904
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:52,560
and Pazio is about the deepest religious thinker I ever encountered.

905
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,040
And he was a postmodernist for a good while,

906
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:57,280
and so is expert in that domain as well,

907
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,600
which makes him a particularly vicious critic now

908
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,240
of the postmodernist types.

909
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:05,920
Anyways, we walk the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem.

910
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:13,200
And what that is, so if you imagine a tragic story,

911
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,400
then you embody that.

912
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,920
And the ultimate tragic story is the worst possible thing

913
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,480
happening to the best possible person, right?

914
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:25,280
That's the pinnacle towards which all tragedy strives,

915
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:26,240
you might say.

916
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:31,360
And walking the Via Dolorosa is an exercise in literary experience.

917
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:35,840
Because the point of that pilgrimage, so to speak,

918
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:41,120
is to place yourself not only in the role of the recipient

919
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,720
of all that brutality,

920
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:46,560
but also in the role of the deliverer of the brutality, right?

921
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:51,440
Imagine yourself as the mob, as yourself as the best friend

922
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:56,800
who betrays, as the intellectually hubristic Pharisee

923
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,760
and scribe, as the hapless ruler of Rome.

924
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,040
That's all you.

925
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,680
And that's what literature does, it walks you through that.

926
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:08,720
And I think Macbeth and Macbeth and plays of that magnitude

927
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:14,640
are threatening to the woke types, most particularly,

928
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:20,400
because they do require that pilgrimage of moral inquiry.

929
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:23,040
And that does upset the ideological apple cart.

930
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,480
So they hate art, they hate art,

931
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,880
because it pushes past propaganda always.

932
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,960
Exactly, and that's why the passion of the Christ

933
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:32,400
is the most powerful story and the most enduring story,

934
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:36,240
not story, but account of the brutality that we...

935
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,720
I mean, when you read about the experience of Jesus

936
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:41,440
on the way to Calvary, can any of us be sure

937
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,440
that we wouldn't be among the jeering mobs

938
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:44,080
throwing the stones?

939
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:45,600
No, we can be sure we would be.

940
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,680
We can be certain we would be.

941
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,200
The woke don't agree with that, do they?

942
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,920
Because the woke like to judge the past,

943
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:55,920
and they will say that if I had lived in the antebellum south,

944
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,360
if I had lived in the Civil War,

945
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,200
I would have been the ones trying to free the slaves.

946
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:00,400
I wouldn't have been a slave owner.

947
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,320
I wouldn't have been one of those people

948
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:05,280
who supported racial segregation.

949
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:06,400
But of course they would.

950
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,760
And in fact, they would have been the first ones.

951
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,600
So, okay, so let's...

952
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,600
All right, so I've been thinking

953
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:15,200
about this mythological motif of the harrowing of hell.

954
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:20,240
So what happens in this ultimate tragedy

955
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:22,000
is that, well, first of all,

956
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,640
the best possible person is put to death

957
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,360
by the worst possible people in the worst possible way.

958
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,840
And you might think, well, that's as bad as it gets.

959
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:30,080
Right?

960
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:33,120
Because sort of by definition, that's as bad as it gets.

961
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,440
But you know, that isn't as bad as it gets.

962
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:38,080
And that's pretty awful because, you know,

963
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,600
you just pointed to something

964
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:40,880
is that if you're looking at history

965
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,480
and you have any bloody sense,

966
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:45,120
you think, I wouldn't have been a victim or a hero.

967
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,560
I would have been a perpetrator

968
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,240
because most people were perpetrators.

969
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,880
Although, you know, there were plenty of victims.

970
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,240
I would have been a perpetrator.

971
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:53,760
And so then when you realize

972
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,240
that you likely would have been a perpetrator

973
01:16:56,240 --> 01:17:00,240
and that you probably are at the moment unbeknownst to yourself,

974
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,000
well, then you're facing something,

975
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,400
I think, that is in some ways worse than death.

976
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,760
I think it's hell.

977
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:08,800
I actually think that is that you have to understand

978
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:12,080
that there is a part of you that would willingly dwell in hell

979
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,480
before you can rescue yourself from it at all.

980
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,880
You know, and I think that's what we're called to do

981
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,720
in the aftermath of the 20th century

982
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:21,680
and the horrors of Auschwitz to wake up and think,

983
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,360
oh my God, there's something inside us

984
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:26,320
that's so malevolent that to gaze upon it for a second

985
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,800
is to suffer for nightmares from nightmares

986
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,160
for the rest of your life.

987
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:32,480
But that that's also your moral obligation.

988
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,880
And that seems to me what the harrowing of hell is, right?

989
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,960
It's the descent through death

990
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:39,040
into the realm of malevolence itself

991
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:41,440
and to take that onto yourself.

992
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:44,800
So when the woke try to police art,

993
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:50,160
apply trigger warnings to art, censor it, remove scenes, et cetera,

994
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:54,880
are they, in your view, attempting to prevent that experience,

995
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:58,240
that necessary human experience of confronting

996
01:17:58,240 --> 01:17:59,920
the worst possible version of yourself?

997
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,200
Is that what they're doing?

998
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,960
That's what it looks like to me.

999
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,280
I mean, I think they're protecting themselves

1000
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,360
from chaotic complexity,

1001
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,840
but that also denies them possibility.

1002
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,680
So that's terrible and hope.

1003
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:13,280
But more importantly,

1004
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:16,560
they're trying to shuffle off the responsibility

1005
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,560
of confronting Satan in the desert.

1006
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,520
So there's something,

1007
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,520
well, I mean, there's something quite understandable

1008
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,400
about all of that, isn't there?

1009
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,560
Because it is uncomfortable.

1010
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,280
I mean, people have done this with the arts forever.

1011
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,280
When, I mean, one of the most interesting things

1012
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,200
I think about King Lear, for instance,

1013
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,560
the Shakespeare's King Lear,

1014
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:37,600
is that that was not the, after 1680, roughly 1680,

1015
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,760
his version wasn't on the stage anymore.

1016
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,240
It was rewritten by a guy called Neham Tate.

1017
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:43,600
And that was the version of King Lear

1018
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,840
that was on the stage for 150 years.

1019
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,880
And in that version, you have a happy ending.

1020
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,720
You don't have Lear come in,

1021
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:53,680
cradling his daughter who's been hanged,

1022
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:56,880
because they couldn't cope with that.

1023
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:57,760
They couldn't cope.

1024
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,760
And it's not just, it's not just,

1025
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,600
because I think King Lear, of all his plays,

1026
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,600
really represents this complete baron.

1027
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:04,400
I mean, it is baron.

1028
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,680
It's pre-Christian.

1029
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:06,560
It is godless.

1030
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:10,240
It's this society where exactly what you describe,

1031
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:14,320
the best type of person has the worst possible experience.

1032
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,440
In spite of what critics have said,

1033
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:18,960
Lear is meant to be much loved, a great ruler,

1034
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,360
who is subjected to this endless cruelty

1035
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:26,000
that ultimately ends in an unbearable moment.

1036
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,720
The unbearable moment is Cordelia coming in dead.

1037
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,800
His fall has been hanged.

1038
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,760
It is complete nihilism.

1039
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,920
This is a play that makes you think,

1040
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,280
what if there was nothing else?

1041
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,640
What if there was no god?

1042
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,800
What if being good didn't matter?

1043
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,280
What if the very worst things happened to the best?

1044
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,400
And they couldn't handle it.

1045
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,040
So the Neham Tate version was what people went to see.

1046
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:51,440
And in the end, Cordelia gets married to Edgar.

1047
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,400
And it's a happy ending.

1048
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,720
And although that seems like a travesty to us,

1049
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,280
it actually makes sense to me as well.

1050
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:01,120
It makes sense why audience goers didn't want to confront that.

1051
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:02,240
Why would they?

1052
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:05,840
Well, I don't think they would,

1053
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,080
but I think the horrible truth might be that

1054
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:11,200
the only way to paradise is through death and hell.

1055
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,320
Right.

1056
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:15,840
And that's like, I'm not saying that with any degree of satisfaction,

1057
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:16,640
but I don't see it.

1058
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:19,200
Because look, one of the things I tried to do,

1059
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,560
I took my studies of Auschwitz in particular,

1060
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,880
but also the Gulag really seriously.

1061
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,000
I was trying to figure out

1062
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:28,640
what I could do.

1063
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:31,600
Well, I tried to put myself in the position

1064
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,320
of an Auschwitz camp guard who kind of enjoyed his job.

1065
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:36,000
Right.

1066
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,200
And the horrible thing is you can put yourself in that position.

1067
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:41,200
And the horrible thing about that is you discover

1068
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,920
all sorts of things about yourself there by doing so

1069
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:46,320
that you pretty much wish you never discovered.

1070
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:50,400
But the upside, and I suppose this is the redemptive upside,

1071
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,760
is that if you recognize within yourself

1072
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,240
the source of all malevolence and evil,

1073
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:58,880
if you can actually do that, if you'll look at that,

1074
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,480
then you can transcend it.

1075
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,080
But there's no other way.

1076
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,200
There's no pretense.

1077
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:06,160
And so I've been terrified of this for decades.

1078
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:07,840
It's what I taught my students at Harvard

1079
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,120
and at the University of Toronto.

1080
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,760
I said, you have to take upon yourself

1081
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,440
the sins of the perpetrator in order

1082
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,840
to rectify the catastrophe of the Holocaust.

1083
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,400
You know, weirdly and perversely,

1084
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,680
the leftist radicals in some demented way

1085
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:23,360
are insisting upon that, right?

1086
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,960
They say, well, the problem is,

1087
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:29,200
is they put the onus on the souls of other people.

1088
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,760
They say, well, look, you powerful people,

1089
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,960
you white people, you privileged group people,

1090
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:36,160
you're the perpetrators.

1091
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:38,880
It's like, no, god damn it, you're the perpetrator.

1092
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,800
It's really hard, though, for them to put themselves

1093
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,960
in that position and for them to confront

1094
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,480
that aspect of their own soul, if we want to call it that.

1095
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,080
Yeah, it's the hardest thing.

1096
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,360
It's the hardest thing.

1097
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:52,400
But also, they can't do it because they don't recognize

1098
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,320
their own behavior for what it is.

1099
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,960
They don't see that they are the cruelest of the cruel.

1100
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,360
They don't see that they are themselves

1101
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,520
capable of all sorts of monstrosities

1102
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,120
because I've seen the way they behave.

1103
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,480
Well, it also might be, Andrew,

1104
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,240
that they don't see anything like,

1105
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:11,040
something has to, okay, I always believe

1106
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,720
that if you understood something,

1107
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,520
you could find your way forward.

1108
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:16,640
Like, I would say that's,

1109
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,560
and I think my father helped me with that

1110
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:19,920
in some deep way, right?

1111
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,680
He instilled that in me in some way.

1112
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:22,800
I don't really understand.

1113
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,600
And I've always been convinced of that.

1114
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:30,800
And so one of the consequences of that

1115
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,840
is the idea that, well, if you can take it

1116
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,200
upon yourself to gaze into the abyss,

1117
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:39,360
let's say as deep as you possibly can,

1118
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,280
that what you will see eventually

1119
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,280
if you look hard enough is the light.

1120
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,880
But you know, you have to believe

1121
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,720
that the light is a possibility, right?

1122
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:49,200
And maybe that's the fundamental axiom

1123
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:52,000
of an appropriate faith, is the light is a possibility.

1124
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,320
And if all you believe is that power rules,

1125
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,200
well, how can you look upon evil without despair?

1126
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,760
And what are the consequences for humanity

1127
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,600
if you have a ruling ideology

1128
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,360
that doesn't enable any of us

1129
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,960
to have that experience anymore?

1130
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:05,600
Because that seems to me to be also-

1131
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,200
Well, we know what the consequences

1132
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:08,880
we saw in the 20th century.

1133
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:09,760
Right.

1134
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:11,280
Right?

1135
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:12,400
Many, many times.

1136
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:16,240
Well, I suppose then, it's not too alarmist

1137
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:17,840
to say that that's where the woke are leading us.

1138
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:19,120
Certainly the spiritual.

1139
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,400
That's what it looks like to me.

1140
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:26,160
Well, no comedy, no art, no literature, right?

1141
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:31,520
No science, no free speech, no redemption from guilt.

1142
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:32,400
Yes.

1143
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,240
No genuine individual identity,

1144
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:36,000
no up, no down, right?

1145
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,880
Just a desert of barren endeavor, right?

1146
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:41,200
Yes.

1147
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,360
With maybe some impulsive hedonism

1148
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:44,480
thrown in now and then to-

1149
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:48,400
And yet they would deny everything you've just said.

1150
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,240
They would deny every claim that you're making there.

1151
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,960
They would say they're not trying to do any of that at all.

1152
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,560
That they want to preserve art.

1153
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,160
They want free speech to flourish.

1154
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:58,800
They just want to protect marginalized communities

1155
01:23:58,800 --> 01:23:59,520
within that.

1156
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,960
That would be their argument.

1157
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:02,640
So it's very difficult to combat.

1158
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:05,680
Yeah, well, the marginalized community argument

1159
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:07,120
is a very interesting one too.

1160
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,640
I've been trying to work that through,

1161
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:09,840
especially with Pajot.

1162
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,800
You know, and he helped me walk through

1163
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:15,120
the idea of the center and the fringe

1164
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,320
in the biblical corpus.

1165
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:19,440
And so there's an idea, for example,

1166
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:25,600
in the ancient geography of the ancient Israelite times,

1167
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:30,400
the poor were allowed to glean on the edges of the fields.

1168
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:32,320
Right?

1169
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:35,840
So there was a border of uncertainty around,

1170
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:38,240
what would you say?

1171
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,240
Around a demarcated territory.

1172
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:43,200
And that border of uncertainty was where

1173
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:46,560
the marginalized were allowed to thrive.

1174
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,720
And so there does have to be a center,

1175
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:49,920
and there has to be a margin.

1176
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,240
But if you bring the margin to the center,

1177
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:54,800
you destroy the center, and you destroy the margin.

1178
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,880
And that's partly why I don't buy the postmodern claim

1179
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,200
that it's compassion that's driving

1180
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,680
the centering of the marginalized,

1181
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:07,280
because that's a serpent that eats its own tail.

1182
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:09,280
And I think what we're seeing happen right now

1183
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:12,320
on the LGBT front is that the fringe of the fringe

1184
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,000
is devouring the fringe.

1185
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:19,280
Faster than the center even, because you know that most of the kids

1186
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:23,200
who are surgically transitioned would have been gay.

1187
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,280
It's 80%, right?

1188
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:27,120
So that's pretty damn interesting.

1189
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,480
Well, that might be the thing that breaks it apart.

1190
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,080
I wonder if that's the thing that breaks it apart,

1191
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:36,800
because there is now a schism within this LGBTQIA2S+,

1192
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,080
whatever you want to call it, community,

1193
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:41,200
which doesn't exist anyway.

1194
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:44,080
And the schism is precisely what you described,

1195
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:46,080
which is that gender identity ideology

1196
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:51,920
is not just a fanciful theory,

1197
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:55,280
a quasi-religious way of viewing the world.

1198
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,280
It's also actively anti-gay.

1199
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:01,040
And so far as it does suggest,

1200
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,440
well, firstly, it denies homosexuality,

1201
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:06,400
because homosexuality and gay rights have always been predicated

1202
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,560
on the recognition that a minority of people

1203
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,320
are attracted to members of their own sex.

1204
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:14,400
It eliminates that by saying there's no such thing as same-sex attraction,

1205
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:18,000
and that actually you should be attracted to gender or gender identity.

1206
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,760
This is why Stonewall, which is the UK's foremost LGBT charity,

1207
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:24,960
redefined the word homosexual on their website

1208
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:27,920
to say it's same gender attracted.

1209
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:31,120
I wrote an article recently about this, and I mentioned Nancy Kelly.

1210
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:33,600
Non-women being attracted to other non-women.

1211
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:34,080
Right, oh my goodness.

1212
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:35,200
No, non-men.

1213
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,280
Non-men being attracted to other non-men.

1214
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,400
That was great, man.

1215
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,400
That's the definition of lesbian now is non-men.

1216
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,320
They're attracted to non-men.

1217
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,440
It's unbelievable.

1218
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:46,480
And Nancy Kelly, the CEO of Stonewall,

1219
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:50,560
has said that women who want to exclude biological men

1220
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:52,880
from their dating pool are sexual racists,

1221
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,400
or akin to sexual racists.

1222
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,520
Well, that's the logical.

1223
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:56,720
That's the logical.

1224
01:26:56,720 --> 01:27:00,960
I said this five years ago in a discussion I had at Queen's University.

1225
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:04,480
It's like, well, you don't think discrimination is right.

1226
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:05,440
No, we don't.

1227
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,120
Well, how about sexual discrimination?

1228
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,720
Should you just lay down on the ground

1229
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:11,280
and spread your legs for every comer, so to speak?

1230
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:14,400
Because you're certainly being discriminatory if you don't.

1231
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,080
Like, really, like, fundamentally,

1232
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:19,040
that is the most egregious form of discrimination.

1233
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,000
They're right about that.

1234
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:20,400
Absolutely.

1235
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,240
A sexual orientation is a form of discrimination.

1236
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:24,880
Like, she says you're like a sexual racist

1237
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,320
if you don't want to sleep with someone with a penis

1238
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:27,120
and you're a woman.

1239
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:28,480
No, you're just homosexual.

1240
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,080
She's describing homosexuality there,

1241
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,640
but she's saying that homosexuality is itself bigoted.

1242
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:35,600
And that's coming from the head of the gay rights,

1243
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,520
the foremost gay rights charity in this country.

1244
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:38,480
That's insane.

1245
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:40,560
The inversions are incredible.

1246
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:44,880
You know, when I was at school, the kids who were effeminate,

1247
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,160
the boys who were effeminate,

1248
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,000
who didn't want to play football and all the rest of it,

1249
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,080
the bullies called them girls.

1250
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:50,960
They said, you're just girls.

1251
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,080
You're not even a proper boy.

1252
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:53,280
You're not a real boy.

1253
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:56,160
That's what Mermaids and Stonewall says now.

1254
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,680
They say, that's what the Tavistock was doing.

1255
01:27:57,680 --> 01:28:00,240
They're saying, you're basically probably trapped in the wrong body.

1256
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:01,360
Let's fix you.

1257
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:04,080
Like you say, between 80 and 90% of adolescents

1258
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:06,400
referred to the Tavistock Clinic are same-sex attracted.

1259
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,760
Well, that's what they do in Tehran.

1260
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,640
That's the head of gender transformation,

1261
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:12,400
sex transformation surgery in the world.

1262
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,560
Which is really quite something.

1263
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:18,640
The mothers in Tehran and the heads of Stonewall are peas in a pod.

1264
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:22,400
They're totally, they feel the same way about homosexuality.

1265
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:26,160
Iran and Pakistan for a while, although not anymore,

1266
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:29,360
were funding same-sex change operations

1267
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:31,440
because they hang gay people from cranes.

1268
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:35,360
That's why you get the death penalty for being gay.

1269
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:38,240
So of course they want to heterosexualize and fix gay people.

1270
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:40,160
But I would never have seen this coming.

1271
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:41,120
None of us did.

1272
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:42,720
I've spoken to all these gay activists

1273
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,640
who've come out of retirement basically,

1274
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,320
and they're like, we never saw it coming.

1275
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,160
It's more dangerous now to be a gay kid

1276
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:51,600
than it was when I was growing up.

1277
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,160
Far more dangerous when I was growing up.

1278
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:55,040
Oh, yes.

1279
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:55,520
Yeah.

1280
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:57,920
So you guys were actually doing pretty good under the,

1281
01:28:58,560 --> 01:28:58,960
what would you say?

1282
01:28:58,960 --> 01:28:59,840
We were doing all right.

1283
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:02,480
The thumb of the Judeo-Christian fascists

1284
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:05,920
instead of the tender mercies of the T-activist types.

1285
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,200
You know, we had the government implementing a thing called Section 28

1286
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:13,360
where they said that teachers couldn't mention homosexuality in schools

1287
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:15,200
unless they linked it to AIDS.

1288
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:16,080
That's not great.

1289
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:17,600
That's a terrible situation to be in.

1290
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:19,760
So there was that.

1291
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:22,960
So we had anti-gay ideas from members of staff.

1292
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:23,280
Fine.

1293
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:27,680
If you were out as a gay kid, which no one was, by the way,

1294
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:28,800
you would be beaten up.

1295
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,320
You would be bullied.

1296
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:31,680
You would be abused, right?

1297
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:34,800
But what you wouldn't have is the figures in authority

1298
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,320
wanting to chop your dick off.

1299
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:40,400
And that's so it's much more dangerous now.

1300
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:44,240
Like you wouldn't have politicians and the media

1301
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:47,440
and the commentary and gay charity saying,

1302
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:49,120
maybe we need to fix you.

1303
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:50,240
Maybe we need to sterilize you.

1304
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:53,200
So let me ask you a question about that.

1305
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:54,400
And this is one that's really,

1306
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,400
well, I don't know what to make of it.

1307
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:01,200
I just like the stereotypical guy who says he's not bigoted.

1308
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:04,000
I have a lot of gay friends, and they're people I really admire.

1309
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,600
So Bjorn Lomburg, Douglas Murray, you, Andy Know.

1310
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:08,880
That's four.

1311
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:11,360
Those are pretty stellar examples, by the way.

1312
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,440
I have a sneaking suspicion, by the way,

1313
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:17,440
that the genetic configuration that leads to male homosexuality

1314
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:21,040
is integrally tied up with creativity itself.

1315
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,440
And that's why it sustains itself in the gene pool.

1316
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,040
That is fascinating.

1317
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,520
If true, put it aside, because I've always wondered

1318
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:29,920
why you have this disproportionate correlation

1319
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:31,760
of homosexuality and art.

1320
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,800
Another possibility too, which is that if you happen to get

1321
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:38,160
the balance between masculine and feminine qualities

1322
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:42,400
exactly right as a man, you are hyper attractive to women.

1323
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,360
So that's another possibility.

1324
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:50,080
So you could think of homosexuality as an overshoot of that target.

1325
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:53,360
Now, I'm speculating, although I think the creativity hypothesis

1326
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,240
is a better one.

1327
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:56,960
Imagine that homosexuality is polygenetic,

1328
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:00,720
but it's associated with a much higher probability of creativity.

1329
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,280
Well, then obviously it's going to be conserved,

1330
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:06,720
even though it has lack of reproductive ability.

1331
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:10,000
It has to be associated with something stellar,

1332
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,680
because obviously it would just disappear.

1333
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:15,520
So and gay men are radically overrepresented

1334
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:17,600
in creative disciplines, like radically.

1335
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:19,680
If you can get to the heart of why that is,

1336
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:20,960
I'd be absolutely fascinated by that.

1337
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:22,720
But that was a side point, wasn't it?

1338
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:24,640
That was a side point from what you wanted to say about.

1339
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:27,200
Yeah. Well, here is what I wanted to ask you about.

1340
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:28,640
And I don't know what to do about this.

1341
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:30,640
It's like, I think that part of the problem

1342
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:33,440
that we're trying to figure out is back 20 years ago,

1343
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:38,080
we did what we could to bring, especially male homosexuality,

1344
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:42,480
into the center by legalizing gay marriage

1345
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:45,600
and by attempting to normalize it in some ways.

1346
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,680
Now, I think that left a lot of questions unanswered.

1347
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:50,880
So here's one question.

1348
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:53,840
It's like, well, okay, now if it's normalized all of a sudden,

1349
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:58,640
same-sex relationships, same-sex sexual relationships,

1350
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:02,720
where do you draw the line and what the hell do you teach children?

1351
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:06,640
And one answer would be, you don't talk about sex at all.

1352
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:07,840
And another answer would be, well,

1353
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:10,320
you talk about gay sex 50% of the time.

1354
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:15,200
I don't know what the answer is, but it really is a problem.

1355
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:18,080
And I think we're dashing ourself to pieces

1356
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:19,840
in some ways trying to solve that problem.

1357
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:23,360
I don't know what the hell the solution in the US

1358
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,760
is take your kids out of the school system.

1359
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:27,600
That's what the solution seems to be.

1360
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,920
So, but I don't know what you think about all that.

1361
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:31,200
It's so difficult because I think

1362
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:33,440
educationists at the moment are getting it very, very wrong

1363
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:35,600
in terms of what they're teaching children about sex

1364
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,840
and gender and sexuality and all the rest of it.

1365
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,520
And I think gay people are bearing the brunt

1366
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,440
of a lot of the blame here, you know?

1367
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:43,680
So I think what's happening is, you know,

1368
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:46,720
when you have drag queens twerking in front of children

1369
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,760
or stripping in front of children or whatever.

1370
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,120
Yeah, that doesn't seem good.

1371
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,240
It doesn't look good.

1372
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:54,000
And because they have bracketed us all as LGBTQIA+,

1373
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,600
this is one big thing, then, you know,

1374
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:00,800
and there's evidence, isn't there, that homophobia

1375
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,160
or at least I don't really like the word,

1376
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,640
but anti-gay sentiment is on the rise

1377
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:06,080
because I think they think this is,

1378
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:08,240
they think this is gay people doing all of this stuff.

1379
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:09,840
It's not, it's gender ideologues.

1380
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:11,920
It's gender ideologues who have taken over

1381
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,000
the LGBT community, whatever that might be.

1382
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,040
And as I've said, gender ideology

1383
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:18,880
is actively hostile to homosexuality.

1384
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:25,200
So gay people aren't the agents of these societal changes.

1385
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:26,480
They're the victims of it,

1386
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:28,160
because now I'm getting it from both sides.

1387
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:32,400
So I published that article in the mail about the Pride flag,

1388
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:36,080
and I was getting gender ideologues piling in on me,

1389
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:39,600
calling me evil and telling me I should kill myself

1390
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:41,200
and, you know, the lovely things

1391
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:42,640
that the compassionate people often say.

1392
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:46,000
And then I was also getting right-wing people,

1393
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,240
mostly from America, calling me a sodomite

1394
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:49,360
and saying that I was evil

1395
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:50,960
and that I was going to burn in hell

1396
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:52,000
for my sexual orientation.

1397
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,280
So now we've got it from both sides.

1398
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,000
So great.

1399
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:54,720
Thanks for that.

1400
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:56,720
I mean, that's what the woke have done.

1401
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:59,280
They, you know, it's not, and that's why...

1402
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:00,800
Yeah, and that isn't over yet.

1403
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,000
You know, that isn't over yet.

1404
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,400
That's going to get a lot worse before it gets better.

1405
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,320
And God only knows how it's going to shake out.

1406
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:09,280
I mean, this year's Pride celebration

1407
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:11,360
was a whole new set of...

1408
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:13,120
Well, people are getting sick of it.

1409
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:14,240
Yes, yes, yes.

1410
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:15,520
Well, no bloody wonder.

1411
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:16,800
A month, really?

1412
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:17,600
Yeah.

1413
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:19,040
Good God, guys.

1414
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:20,800
Partly because it's become so corporate.

1415
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:23,520
You know, corporations put their flags up.

1416
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:24,720
They don't put it up in the Middle East

1417
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:26,960
or in Saudi Arabia or places like that,

1418
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:28,960
where it might actually make a difference, by the way,

1419
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:31,440
flying that flag, where gay people are killed for being gay.

1420
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:33,040
No, they don't do that.

1421
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,400
But they put it up here.

1422
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:38,320
They never did this, by the way, before gay marriage,

1423
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,400
before the age of consent was equalized.

1424
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:41,200
They didn't do any of that.

1425
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:44,640
They're doing it now because corporations

1426
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:46,800
are so in lockstep with the woke ideology,

1427
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,000
which is another reason, by the way,

1428
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,920
if you want to go back to this left-right distinction,

1429
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:51,600
why I think this is so unhelpful,

1430
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:52,320
because it's a movement...

1431
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,280
Right, right, I agree.

1432
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:53,920
I agree.

1433
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:56,000
Well, and I don't think there's any worse woke

1434
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,600
than woke capitalism.

1435
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:57,840
No, no.

1436
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:00,640
That's the bastard child of greed and ideology, man.

1437
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:00,880
I mean, that's...

1438
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,080
It's some sort of monster.

1439
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:03,680
Well, that is right-wing wokeness.

1440
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:06,160
It can't be anything but because capitalism is a set...

1441
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:08,640
You know, these are essentially money-making bodies.

1442
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:09,440
These are not...

1443
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:12,400
These are not socialist organizations.

1444
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:13,360
It's...

1445
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:14,720
So there is a confusion there.

1446
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:16,000
And also, by the way,

1447
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:19,840
the woke always side against the workers.

1448
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:20,880
You know, whenever these...

1449
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:21,440
I know.

1450
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:22,080
That's so in...

1451
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:22,720
And the poor.

1452
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:23,280
And the poor.

1453
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:24,320
And the poor, so...

1454
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:24,880
I know.

1455
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:26,320
That's so interesting, too,

1456
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:28,400
because I've watched the radicals,

1457
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,800
especially in Europe over the last five years,

1458
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:31,680
because I was curious.

1459
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:34,000
It's like, well, when push comes to shove,

1460
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,840
let's say, on the climate front,

1461
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:38,960
are they going to sacrifice the poor on the altar of woke?

1462
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:41,280
And the answer is, in a bloody heartbeat,

1463
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,320
in a second, no holds forward.

1464
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,000
That's what net zero does.

1465
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,520
Net zero is precisely that.

1466
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:46,960
It's the poor, the better-brun.

1467
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:47,760
But that's why I don't think...

1468
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:48,960
Absolutely.

1469
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,800
And whereas I'm probably wrong to say

1470
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:54,080
the wokeness is closer to the right or whatever that is,

1471
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:55,680
it's definitely not a left-wing movement

1472
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:56,800
in any traditional understanding

1473
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:57,760
of what left-wing means.

1474
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:58,640
It can't be.

1475
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:00,240
No, I think we have to stop thinking

1476
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:01,440
about it politically altogether.

1477
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:01,600
Exactly, exactly.

1478
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:02,720
I think, fundamentally,

1479
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:04,720
the religious analysis is the right one.

1480
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:06,480
But that's a weird one, Andrew.

1481
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:08,400
That's going to take us some strange places,

1482
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,160
because if this is actually...

1483
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:12,000
First of all, we're actually making the claim

1484
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,240
that this is a spiritual battle, right?

1485
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:15,520
A religious battle.

1486
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,400
And that's a hell of a claim to make, you know?

1487
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:20,320
Especially for somebody who's more tilted

1488
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:21,440
towards atheism.

1489
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:23,040
And I don't even know what the hell it means

1490
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,160
to make that claim.

1491
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:27,040
But I don't think it is a political struggle, fundamentally.

1492
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:27,680
That's right.

1493
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:30,960
And to bring that into the LGBTQ stuff,

1494
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:33,200
the way that sex education appears

1495
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:34,560
to be run at the moment,

1496
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,160
I don't know how it is necessarily where you are,

1497
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:39,280
but in Wales, definitely, in Scotland, definitely,

1498
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:40,880
and in England, we are having similar problems,

1499
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:44,640
you have gender ideologues writing the curriculum,

1500
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:45,200
effectively.

1501
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:45,600
Yeah, yeah.

1502
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:46,960
So children are being told.

1503
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:49,040
Even worse, Canada, after all.

1504
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:50,320
Oh, yeah, of course, of course.

1505
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:51,760
Think of this country.

1506
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,760
I mean, we've got narcissistic...

1507
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:55,680
We've got, what would we say?

1508
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:59,280
We've got the cardinal narcissist running our country.

1509
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:01,920
He's everything woke you could possibly imagine.

1510
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:04,000
And he's got that psychopathic charm

1511
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,280
that lends itself to fooling gullible women.

1512
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,040
It's a perfect bloody storm.

1513
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:13,040
I don't see any difference between effectively encouraging teachers

1514
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:18,080
to promote gender identity ideology to young children

1515
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:22,560
as having some kind of hook-handed Islamic cleric come in

1516
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:24,720
and say gay people should be burned to death.

1517
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:26,160
I don't really see the difference there.

1518
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:32,560
And so far as you're promoting a really reactionary belief system

1519
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:35,280
on to children when it comes to the realm of sex and sexuality.

1520
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:37,360
And I think that's really, really dangerous.

1521
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,440
So unless we grapple with this point,

1522
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:42,400
or unless we as a general population grapple with the fact

1523
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:46,000
that sex education now is really a religious preaching,

1524
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:46,720
that's all it is.

1525
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,320
You were talking about where do you stop?

1526
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:52,320
How much do you teach them about what?

1527
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:53,760
Actually, kids generally learn

1528
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,440
and figure things out for themselves, don't they?

1529
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:57,920
So I've always been of the view that sex education

1530
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:59,120
doesn't need to be as...

1531
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:01,280
I think people need to know the basics.

1532
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:04,400
But I think there's far too much of it going on.

1533
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:05,840
But we've reached the point where,

1534
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:08,160
I mean, you must have heard this audio recording

1535
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:10,960
that was leaked this week from a school in England,

1536
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,640
a place called Rye College.

1537
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:17,200
The teacher was recorded berating two 13-year-old girls

1538
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:18,560
because they would not accept

1539
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,960
that one of their peers identified as a cat.

1540
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:21,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1541
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,440
And look, it looks silly.

1542
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:24,720
Well, it's pretty rude, you know.

1543
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:26,000
It is.

1544
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,560
To not let the poor girl wear a tail and all that.

1545
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,280
Well, you know, this is the thing.

1546
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,480
There was a report in the Telegraph this week as well

1547
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:37,680
saying that there's a school where one child identifies

1548
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:38,800
as a horse.

1549
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,560
There's one who identifies as a dinosaur.

1550
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:42,080
There's one who, quite creatively,

1551
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:45,040
identifies as a moon and wears a cape.

1552
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:46,480
Now, I think what's happening there

1553
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:48,560
is those kids are being satirical.

1554
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:50,080
They're... What they're seeing is...

1555
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:51,120
God, I hope so.

1556
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:51,600
No, I think they are.

1557
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:52,240
Go, kids, go.

1558
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:54,240
You know, the kids that are saying,

1559
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:56,400
I'm a cat and I need to lie down

1560
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,480
and I need to be stroked and I need to meow.

1561
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:01,280
Look, they have seen that the figures of authority,

1562
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:04,240
the teachers, are totally capitulating

1563
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:06,240
to this bizarre belief system,

1564
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:09,440
this esoteric cult, and unless...

1565
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:10,800
I would have done that in a heartbeat

1566
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:11,440
when I was 30.

1567
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:12,080
I would have.

1568
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:14,480
As a kid, I would have said,

1569
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:16,400
I'm a velociraptor and you know,

1570
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:17,760
you have to, you know, and you do what I say

1571
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:18,880
or I'll eat you or whatever.

1572
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:21,200
I don't care what it is, but they...

1573
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:22,160
These kids are pushy.

1574
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:23,520
They always test the limits anyway.

1575
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:25,520
But what's brilliant about this is

1576
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:28,720
the teachers can't do anything about it.

1577
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:32,320
If a young child decides he's a moon

1578
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:33,600
and wears a cape and a teacher says,

1579
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:34,400
no, you're not,

1580
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:35,840
she's denying the sacred creed

1581
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,360
of gender identity ideology,

1582
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:38,960
which is in the national curriculum now.

1583
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:41,440
So she'll get fired.

1584
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:44,560
So this puts the kids in an incredible position of power.

1585
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:45,840
They're having fun with it.

1586
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:50,160
And this is also why I'm slightly heartened by this,

1587
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:51,440
because I kind of think the kids

1588
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:53,280
are going to be our way out of this.

1589
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:56,560
I think I hope that this mad religious fervor

1590
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,160
will burn out because the kids see it

1591
01:39:58,160 --> 01:39:59,280
for what it is.

1592
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:00,400
You know, the fact that that woman

1593
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:01,760
in that recording was saying that these girls,

1594
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:03,520
well, I think she said they were despicable.

1595
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:04,640
I think that was the word she used,

1596
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:07,920
despicable for not validating

1597
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:10,800
or accepting their friend's identity as a cat.

1598
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:14,240
I mean, that's such an extreme position

1599
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:15,520
for a teacher to take.

1600
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:16,320
I also don't, by the way,

1601
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:19,520
I don't think it's fair to dog pile her and bombard.

1602
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:22,960
And I saw someone doxing her, putting her face.

1603
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,320
And look, she's just following,

1604
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,640
she's probably not a very intelligent person.

1605
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:27,920
She's probably not a very thinking person.

1606
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:29,920
But she's just following what she's told to say.

1607
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:32,640
She's been told by all of the teacher training colleges,

1608
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:34,080
all of the academics in education

1609
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:35,600
that this is the case and you've got to go with it.

1610
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:37,200
And she's just doing her job.

1611
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:38,720
So I think that's unfair as well.

1612
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:40,960
I would like teachers to be more intelligent

1613
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:42,960
and creative and to challenge this stuff.

1614
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:45,120
But, you know, that's not happening.

1615
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:46,960
So yeah, maybe it may be...

1616
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:49,840
I guess we're learning why the eternal serpent

1617
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:51,680
always devours its own tail, right?

1618
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:52,160
Right.

1619
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:54,240
It's so interesting to see these things

1620
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:57,200
push too far, start to eat themselves.

1621
01:40:57,200 --> 01:40:58,480
You know, it's...

1622
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:00,560
We're living in the strangest times, man.

1623
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:01,360
That might be it.

1624
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:02,560
That might be the hope, though, right?

1625
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:05,360
So it's an optimistic point to make.

1626
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,680
But ultimately, because I think this ideology

1627
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:12,480
is not sustainable, because it is too full of...

1628
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:15,520
We did walk ourselves back from the brink of tyranny

1629
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:17,280
on the COVID lockdown front, right?

1630
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:18,240
I mean, we were...

1631
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:20,480
We went full totalitarian for two years,

1632
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:22,080
but then everybody seemed to decide

1633
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:24,080
maybe that wasn't such a good idea.

1634
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:25,520
But that's quite instructive, isn't it?

1635
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:27,200
The way that we now talk about it.

1636
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:28,720
Everyone sort of...

1637
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:30,000
No one mentions it now, do they?

1638
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:34,560
You walk around, very few people wearing masks.

1639
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:36,800
People have just sort of...

1640
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:38,080
There came a weird turning point

1641
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:39,520
where everyone just decided,

1642
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:42,400
actually, it's a virus with a very low mortality rate.

1643
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:43,600
Let's just not worry about it.

1644
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:44,800
And that just sort of happened.

1645
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:48,880
People have forgotten the mania, the extreme mania.

1646
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:50,560
People screaming at each other on the streets

1647
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:53,760
if they weren't wearing masks and the extreme policies.

1648
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:56,560
The Canadian government's reaction

1649
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,560
to the truckers who were worried

1650
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:00,160
about their livelihood due to lockdown.

1651
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:02,160
You mean stealing their bank accounts?

1652
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:03,760
Stealing their bank accounts

1653
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:05,520
and threatening to give them money

1654
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,440
to other charities or something?

1655
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:08,640
Didn't they even...

1656
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:09,360
I mean, you'll know.

1657
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:10,080
Yeah, yeah, Go said...

1658
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:14,160
So $10 million was raised on GoFundMe.

1659
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:14,960
That's it, yeah.

1660
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:17,920
And then GoFundMe decided

1661
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:20,080
they weren't going to distribute it to the truckers.

1662
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:22,880
Then they decided, instead of refunding it,

1663
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:24,480
they were going to distribute it

1664
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,480
to a charity of their choice.

1665
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,960
Then Ron DeSantis said,

1666
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:31,840
I think you better not do that or else.

1667
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,840
And then they decided they would refund it.

1668
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:36,160
And now the money that hasn't been refunded

1669
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:38,640
is in escrow and there's a huge fight in Canada

1670
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:39,760
about who owns it.

1671
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:41,840
We haven't settled the trucker mess here at all.

1672
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:43,840
But the trucker convoy,

1673
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:45,360
it had something to do with everybody

1674
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:46,960
taking those goddamn masks off.

1675
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:47,600
I'm sure.

1676
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:50,480
I wonder how those politicians

1677
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:52,000
who were involved in this will feel about this

1678
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,200
in 20 years' time.

1679
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:56,320
I know one of your politicians claimed

1680
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:58,800
that the truckers were beeping their horns

1681
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:01,120
because they were dog whistling to fascists

1682
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:03,920
because the honk honk is HH

1683
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:05,360
and that means Heil Hitler.

1684
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:06,960
I mean, that was something that was seriously said by...

1685
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:08,560
Well, that's common knowledge here in Andrew.

1686
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:09,680
Everybody who honks their horn

1687
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:11,520
is actually secretly admiring Hitler,

1688
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:12,800
especially if they do it twice.

1689
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:14,800
That is so insane.

1690
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:17,440
So I wonder whether...

1691
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:19,840
That's Salem which trial level is insane.

1692
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:20,320
Exactly.

1693
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:22,400
And Salem is a good example, right?

1694
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:23,520
Because, you know,

1695
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:25,040
there's a reason I've used it in the book

1696
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:28,240
is that I think it gives us our clues to our way out.

1697
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,640
Because Salem happened so quickly,

1698
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:32,880
it happened within just over a year, right?

1699
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:33,840
Late 17th century,

1700
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:37,200
this hysteria emerged from nowhere

1701
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:39,440
and fizzled out immediately

1702
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:41,520
and everyone afterwards repented.

1703
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:44,480
All of the people who were most involved in it said,

1704
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:45,360
we got that wrong.

1705
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:46,800
What happened there?

1706
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,240
We went mad for a while there

1707
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:49,520
because they weren't...

1708
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:55,600
Well, this is maybe the first widespread mental illness

1709
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:58,400
afflicting our new electronic nervous system.

1710
01:43:58,400 --> 01:43:58,960
That's it.

1711
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:01,920
I think this is a hysteria on a global scale,

1712
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:05,760
akin to what happened in Salem.

1713
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:12,000
I think it's perpetuated itself by a similar means,

1714
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,440
which is firstly just the mechanism of hysteria,

1715
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:16,720
which I'm not qualified to talk about,

1716
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:20,400
but also the fact that people in authority

1717
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:22,880
go along with it because they're terrified not to.

1718
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,400
You know, because in Salem,

1719
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:26,320
anyone said, hang on, I don't think this is right,

1720
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:28,160
they were the next to be executed.

1721
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:29,600
So you don't have politicians saying,

1722
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:33,440
hang on a minute, is it possible for human beings to change sex?

1723
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:34,880
Do I know what a woman is?

1724
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:36,080
They all know the answer,

1725
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:37,920
just as the magistrates in Salem

1726
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:39,600
knew that the girls weren't seeing the devil.

1727
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:42,720
But it all fizzled out very, very quickly.

1728
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:44,720
One of the points I make in the book

1729
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:48,160
is about that all of the prosecutions were secured

1730
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:50,400
on this thing called spectral evidence.

1731
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:52,480
In other words, the girls' experience,

1732
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:53,840
what we call lived experience.

1733
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:56,320
The girls believed that they were seeing devils,

1734
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,800
and therefore that was taken as evidence.

1735
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:00,960
And that's why the cases collapsed,

1736
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:04,160
because at the end, the deputy governor of Massachusetts

1737
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:06,480
wrote to the leading clergyman in the country and said,

1738
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:10,000
can spectral evidence be admissible in court?

1739
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,320
And they all said, no, of course not.

1740
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:13,760
The whole thing disappeared overnight.

1741
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:15,200
Everyone denied they had any part in it.

1742
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:16,880
These weren't witch hunters.

1743
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:18,400
They didn't go around hunting witches.

1744
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:19,440
That happened a lot in Europe.

1745
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:20,880
It didn't happen in New England.

1746
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:21,280
And so they were good people.

1747
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:24,880
Maybe that's the least stupid pathway forward for us now.

1748
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:27,440
And maybe, God willing, that's the one we'll take.

1749
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:29,440
We should stop, I guess, I don't want to,

1750
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:31,120
because you're very entertaining to talk to.

1751
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,440
For everybody watching and listening,

1752
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:35,680
I'm going to talk to Andrew for another half an hour.

1753
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:38,480
On the Daily Wire Plus platform side,

1754
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:40,080
a little bit more personally,

1755
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:42,160
I want to see a bit more about what makes them tick.

1756
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:43,440
And so if you're interested in that,

1757
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:45,360
head over to the Daily Wire Plus platform.

1758
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:47,440
You could throw those characters,

1759
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:50,640
those reprehensible right-wing bastards a penny or two,

1760
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:55,200
if you're inclined to, because they are heading the fight

1761
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:56,480
to support free speech.

1762
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,880
In the US, the YouTube has been after us,

1763
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:01,040
because I'm allied with the Daily Wire types,

1764
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:03,760
been after us pretty badly in the last month.

1765
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:06,160
They took down three of my talks,

1766
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:07,520
including one with Helen Joyce,

1767
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:10,240
because you know how reprehensible good old Helen,

1768
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:12,080
the Economist journalist is.

1769
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:15,120
And they also took down a talk I had with Robert F. Kennedy,

1770
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:18,480
despite the fact that he's running for president.

1771
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:20,000
And so that's YouTube,

1772
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,320
and they're definitely going after all the Daily Wire folks.

1773
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:24,720
So thank you all for your time and attention,

1774
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:26,160
and to Andrew for talking to me

1775
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:28,000
and helping me delve into these things,

1776
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,480
get a little bit more clarity along with everyone else.

1777
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:32,960
And for everyone watching and listening,

1778
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:33,760
we'll see you soon.

1779
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:36,640
And to the Daily Wire folks, thanks for your support.

1780
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:39,200
Andrew, off to the Daily Wire.

1781
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:40,800
Thank you very much.
