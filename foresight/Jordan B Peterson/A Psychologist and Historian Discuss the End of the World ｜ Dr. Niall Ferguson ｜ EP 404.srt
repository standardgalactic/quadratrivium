1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
The more people refer to the science,

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,120
the more you should suspect that they are engaged

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,280
in some quasi-religious activity.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,920
This kind of wrong-headedness leads to all kinds of policy errors

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,200
because people have focused on the satisfaction of asceticism.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,240
It's very significant that in our lifetimes,

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,120
governments have got worse at dealing with disasters, not better.

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,520
Despite the accumulation of scientific knowledge,

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,960
we seem somehow, collectively, to be worse at scientific thinking.

10
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,080
Hello, everyone, watching and listening.

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,280
Today, I'm speaking with historian and author Neil Ferguson.

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,760
We haven't spoken before, although I've wanted to for a long time.

13
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,120
We discuss the historical and deeply mythological precedent

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,640
of world-ending narratives,

15
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,520
how the Global Doomsday Ethos

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,400
abdicates local responsibility while empowering the elite class,

17
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,600
the out-of-control gigantism plaguing our administrative states today,

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,240
and how we might strive as individuals

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,320
to deal with the genuine tragedy of life,

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,040
morally, humbly, and religiously.

21
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,520
So, I was reviewing your book, Doom, this morning,

22
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,440
and I've been wanting to talk to you about it for a long time.

23
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,640
I'm very interested in the apocalyptic vision

24
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:46,760
and its implications for political organization

25
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,840
and psychological organization as well.

26
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,840
And I thought I'd just start with a couple of comments to get us going.

27
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,720
The apocalypse, in some ways, is always upon us,

28
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,400
and you write about that in your book.

29
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,520
I mean, because people might ask,

30
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:09,880
well, why has mankind always been consumed at the narrative level

31
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,720
with notions of the end of the world?

32
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,520
And the answer to that is at least in part

33
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:20,840
because we always inhabit demarcated conceptual worlds

34
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,120
and even embodied worlds,

35
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,000
and all of those worlds do come to an end.

36
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,080
And so, the idea that there's a universal end

37
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,480
is built into the fabric of reality,

38
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,880
and it's something that we have to permanently contend with.

39
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,360
And so, it's there as a lurking existential abyss,

40
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,600
but it's also there as a practical problem that we have to contend with.

41
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,920
And the grand apocalyptic visions, the book of Revelation, for example,

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,360
are in part attempts to structure our apprehension

43
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,320
of the, what would you say, the eternal apocalypse

44
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,280
and to also help us determine, practically and politically,

45
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,200
how that might be at least staved off,

46
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,560
although perhaps even managed more comprehensively.

47
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,840
And so, I guess I'm curious,

48
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,280
why did your interest, do you think,

49
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,480
coalesce around the conception of doom?

50
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,320
And it's been a couple of years now since this book was published,

51
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,080
how have your conceptions changed?

52
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:30,080
And what did you learn as a consequence of investigating this narrative trope so deeply?

53
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,520
There's a great sketch in the Beyond the Fringe album,

54
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,600
which goes right back to Peter Cook and Dudley Moore,

55
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,840
Jonathan Miller and Alan Bennett in the 1960s.

56
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,920
And the sketch is the end of the world,

57
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,800
and it's essentially a sect of millenarians who gather on a hill

58
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,120
to anticipate the end of the world.

59
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,720
They have a long and quite amusing discussion about what it's likely to involve.

60
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,280
Will the veil of the temple be rent asunder?

61
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,960
And the time comes, they count down to the end of the world,

62
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,440
and nothing happens.

63
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,840
And Peter Cook, who's the leader of the sect,

64
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,760
ends the sketch by, well, never mind, lads, same time next week.

65
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,720
And I always thought that was very funny,

66
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,120
because the end of the world has been consistently overpredicted

67
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,880
by human beings for millennia.

68
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,360
We're fascinated by the idea of the end of the world,

69
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,760
and I think it's for a slightly different reason

70
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,680
from the one that you hypothesized.

71
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:42,480
We have the reality that we as individuals end to contend with.

72
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,720
That's just one of the givens of human life.

73
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,760
Even for billionaires in Silicon Valley,

74
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,880
right now, the end of their individual lives is inevitable.

75
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,400
And that's really the hardest thing to deal with about life, that it ends.

76
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,760
And we also know how it ends, we know what that's like,

77
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,000
because at some time or another in our lives, we encounter death.

78
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,480
The death of a grandparent, a parent, of a friend.

79
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,560
We also see things being destroyed.

80
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,600
We see buildings collapse or bridges.

81
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,920
We see fires consume areas of woodland.

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,040
So we know what dissolution looks like,

83
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,640
not just for us as individuals,

84
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,120
but we know what it looks like for expanses of land or edifices.

85
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,360
And I think we therefore infer the consoling thought

86
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:44,320
that it's all going to go down in flames at some future date.

87
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,520
And the great monotheistic religions

88
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,800
have as one of their centerpieces the end of the world.

89
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,520
It's there in Islam as well as in Christianity.

90
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,000
And I think it's also exciting.

91
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,440
I think we find the end of the world kind of a cinematic prospect,

92
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,000
which is why there are so many movies about it,

93
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,320
as well as works of science fiction.

94
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,440
So we're fascinated by the end of the world

95
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,040
because it's clearly a spectacular prospect,

96
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,160
but it's also consoling to us, we may die as individuals,

97
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,640
but everything's going down at some point.

98
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,400
And the issue is when?

99
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:25,320
So many Christians at successive periods in the history of Christianity

100
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,960
have anticipated quite an imminent end of the world.

101
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,120
And of course, they're always disappointed,

102
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,240
like Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.

103
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,760
So the consoling issue,

104
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,800
I mean, the easy read on that, I suppose,

105
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,320
is that the end of the world is the precondition

106
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,760
for the establishment of an ever more glorious paradise.

107
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,760
And you can understand a consolation in that.

108
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,320
But you're pointing to a different kind of consolation, I suppose,

109
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,120
which is, it seems to me, correct me if I'm wrong,

110
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,160
that something like Schadenfreude is that the fact that we end

111
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,320
is easier to swallow if we understand it

112
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,360
in relationship to the potential end of everything.

113
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,520
So I don't exactly understand why you highlighted consolation.

114
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,360
I can see it in the heavenly vision, let's say, post-apocalypse,

115
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,360
but yours, you seem to be pointing to something else.

116
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,600
Well, of course, religion offers an afterlife

117
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,960
that will be better and resurrection in the case of

118
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,040
the great monotheistic religions.

119
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,160
But I don't think that's always what's in people's minds

120
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,760
when they contemplate the end of the world.

121
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,720
I was very struck as I was researching the book,

122
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,960
how many times in the midst of a localized disaster,

123
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,000
individuals said it felt like the end of the world.

124
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,680
So when you're in the midst of a massive conflagration,

125
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,760
the biggest wildfire in US history,

126
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,040
or when you're in London during the Blitz,

127
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,040
when you're in the midst of some localized disaster,

128
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,240
it seems somehow consoling to say,

129
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,960
oh, it's clearly the end of the world.

130
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,080
So I don't think it's just that people say,

131
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,360
and therefore I can look forward to being reunited with my ancestors

132
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,200
in some happy afterlife.

133
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,920
I think there's just a sense that if everybody's going down,

134
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,800
that doesn't make it quite so bad as if it's just me.

135
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,720
Well, you know, there might be another element to it as well.

136
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,920
I mean, the Terminator movie series came to mind

137
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,760
when you were walking through your discussion,

138
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,040
I suppose, in reference to the science fiction

139
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,680
representations of the end of the world.

140
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,560
And all of our conceptual schemes,

141
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,760
when they encounter an obstacle,

142
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,160
undergo a collapse into a kind of chaos

143
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,840
and then a potential regeneration.

144
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,600
And that's the same as a stage transition

145
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,080
in Piagetian child development.

146
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,280
And it's the same as the scientific revolution.

147
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,320
And every act of learning is simultaneously

148
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,040
the death of some set of preconceptions.

149
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,960
And there's pain in that,

150
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,680
which is partly why we don't like to have our ideas challenged.

151
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,520
But you know, there's also adventure in it.

152
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,520
And part of the reason that people do go to watch movies

153
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,320
like The Terminator and the plethora of the end of the world

154
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,680
movies that do make themselves manifest

155
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,920
is because I think we can see in the confrontation

156
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,240
with cataclysm an adventure.

157
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,920
I mean, that's what people are doing in a theater

158
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,680
when they're watching the Terminator series.

159
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,440
I mean, it's a dreadful adventure,

160
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,840
but it's a total adventure.

161
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,240
It's completely engrossing.

162
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,560
And it might be that you could imagine,

163
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,280
and I think that this is part of the emphasis

164
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,640
of the Judeo-Christian notion of ultimate sacrifice.

165
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,440
You could imagine welcoming the apocalyptic reality

166
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,920
of the world with open arms,

167
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,160
being willing to undergo that adventure

168
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,280
of continual death and transformation,

169
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,360
and transforming it,

170
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,760
that entire death and rebirth process

171
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,560
into something like the most exciting possible adventure.

172
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,720
I mean, you know, what you do see in the biblical corpus,

173
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,440
there's always a wrestling with the apocalyptic reality

174
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,520
of existence, socially and individually.

175
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,320
And there is the insistence throughout the text

176
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,720
that the appropriate way to deal with that

177
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,720
is not to run from it or deny it,

178
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,360
but to really, to the degree that it's possible,

179
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,080
to welcome it with open arms.

180
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,560
Now, that's a very tricky thing to manage, obviously.

181
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,000
How do you welcome the death of everything with open arms?

182
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,840
But in some ways, it doesn't matter

183
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,000
because it's a reality that people have to face.

184
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,320
I think what's fascinating about the book of Revelation

185
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,760
is that it's so spectacular.

186
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:53,640
It's an extraordinary visualisation of a cataclysm.

187
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,280
And it's really very elaborate.

188
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,120
It's worth reading and trying to picture it in your mind,

189
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,640
and you realise that you would need the most advanced computer graphics

190
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,080
to realise it on a screen.

191
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,600
I think it's partly that you need a spectacular prelude

192
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,560
for the Kingdom of God to be plausible,

193
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,400
because the terrible truth about the Kingdom of God

194
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,400
is that it does sound quite dull.

195
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,760
I mean, the reality about the saints and angels

196
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,320
and God himself is that they don't really know how to throw a party,

197
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,880
and we need more than that to excite us.

198
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,480
So I think that the apocalypse is attractive

199
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,640
because it's so much more exciting than the ultimate outcome,

200
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,960
the utopian outcome of heaven.

201
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,800
Now, what's interesting about science fiction

202
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,200
is that it really discards utopia.

203
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,120
There's some utopian science fiction about most of its dystopian,

204
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,280
and you gave the example of the Terminator movie series.

205
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,240
That's part of a long tradition of visualising an end of the world

206
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,080
which is dystopian, where an apocalyptic event occurs

207
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,280
and all you're really left with in the case of the Terminator movies

208
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,320
is a pile of rubble in which a few surviving humans

209
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,720
are picked off by killer robots.

210
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,240
The interesting thing to me about science fiction

211
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,160
is that from its birth in the early 19th century as a genre,

212
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,760
it provides the apocalypse without the prospect

213
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,760
of some ultimate reign of God and the saints,

214
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,440
and we find that hugely exciting.

215
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,880
So the paradox at the heart of the book is

216
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,920
that we spend a lot of time thinking about the end of the world.

217
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,080
Of course, environmentalists are the latest heirs

218
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,600
to the millenarian tradition.

219
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,800
They love to say that the world is about to end.

220
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,240
It's in 12 years, it must be now eight years and counting.

221
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,080
That's part of a long tradition where secular movements

222
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,880
embrace often unwittingly religious ideas

223
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,520
about the impending apocalypse.

224
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,640
And that's exciting to people, so they're drawn to it.

225
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,640
Greta Thunberg is just the latest prophet of the millennium.

226
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,600
And I think that's a very important reason

227
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,960
to be sceptical about stories about the end of the world,

228
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,960
because while we spend a lot of time discussing the end of the world

229
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,880
in its latest incarnation, the catastrophic climate scenario,

230
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,400
we kind of miss the much more likely, smaller scale,

231
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,000
medium-sized disasters, and the key point the book makes

232
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,120
is we're getting worse at handling those.

233
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,320
So we spend ages talking about the end of the world,

234
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,400
endless conferences on climate change and the apocalypse,

235
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,600
and we utterly bungle.

236
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,880
Or what was, in fact, not a particularly disastrous pandemic.

237
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,000
And we're going to bungle our way through some geopolitical disasters.

238
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,200
We're doing that right now.

239
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,360
I think that's the critical argument of the book,

240
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,520
and that's why the subtitle of the book is so important,

241
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,760
The Politics of Catastrophe.

242
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,560
The key argument the book makes is that most disasters

243
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,920
shouldn't be thought of as either natural or man-made.

244
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,160
Disasters happen,

245
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,400
and then we, as a species, collectively bungle them or not.

246
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,480
And that's the critical point.

247
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,800
Disasters are, in many ways, politically determined,

248
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,960
even if their origins are natural.

249
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,880
So that's the argument of the book.

250
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,200
As the holiday season unfolds, it's a time of joy,

251
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,040
gratitude, and reflection.

252
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,960
In the midst of all these festivities,

253
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,760
consider taking a moment to reflect on the digital footprint

254
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,720
that accompanies you through the season.

255
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,520
Think about all the information on your phone.

256
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,440
From anything you search, your location,

257
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,520
to the websites you shop at and more,

258
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,840
companies can legally gather this information

259
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,240
and sell your data for profit.

260
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,240
That's why you need to do what I do

261
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,040
and keep your data private with ExpressVPN.

262
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,840
ExpressVPN is an app on your phone and computer

263
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,600
that encrypts all of your online traffic

264
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,840
so whatever you do stays private.

265
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,320
If you think incognito mode will stop people

266
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,000
from tracking your online activity,

267
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,080
think again when you read the fine print

268
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,720
that appears when you start browsing in incognito mode.

269
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,960
It says that your activity might still be visible

270
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,480
to your employer, your school,

271
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,240
or your internet service provider.

272
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,480
Without ExpressVPN, every site you visit

273
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,880
could be logged by the admin of that network.

274
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,240
We love using ExpressVPN because of how easy it is to use.

275
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,680
The app has one button.

276
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,640
Once you turn it on, you're protected from prying eyes.

277
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,880
The Daily Wire has partnered with ExpressVPN

278
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,040
to get you a special holiday offer.

279
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,000

280
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,080
and get three extra months free.

281
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,400
That's expresvpn.com slash jordan.

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,360
ExpressVPN.com slash jordan to learn more.

283
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,480
Okay, so there's three themes there

284
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,560
that I'd like to expound upon.

285
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,640
So the first is, you interestingly pointed out

286
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,000
that the dystopia and the apocalypse

287
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,440
is more interesting than the app.

288
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,600
The first one is, you know,

289
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,120
the dystopia and the apocalypse is more interesting

290
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,120
than the subsequent heaven.

291
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,160
And that's the problem with socialist visions of utopia

292
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,120
that people like Dostoevsky laid out in the late 1800s.

293
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,720
In notes from underground,

294
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
Dostoevsky famously pointed out

295
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,320
that if we did bring about the socialist utopia,

296
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,000
and he described that as the endless opportunity

297
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,560
of pools of bubbling water,

298
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,200
busy ourselves with the continuation of the species

299
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,200
and eat nothing but cake,

300
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,840
that human beings would break it all

301
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,040
into a chaotic mess at the first opportunity

302
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,760
just so that something exciting could happen.

303
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:47,920
And so there's the problem with a satiation vision of heaven.

304
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,840
So that would be a vision where everyone has

305
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,440
everything they need all the time,

306
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,880
is that precisely when you do that with an infant

307
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,000
or when you enter that state after Thanksgiving dinner,

308
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,720
Christmas dinner, all you do is go to sleep.

309
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,960
There's no reason to be conscious.

310
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,320
Consciousness demands something like an adventure.

311
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,920
And the classic vision of heaven does seem lacking

312
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,640
in that it isn't obvious what you would do there.

313
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,360
So that's something we could delve into.

314
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,240
Then you pointed out that one of the additional

315
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,160
underground advantages to being an apocalyptic doomsayer

316
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,440
is that you can...

317
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,200
I'm modifying your argument slightly,

318
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,000
but that you can present yourself

319
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,920
as the ultimate virtue-seeking redeemer

320
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,760
by claiming to be obsessed by nothing but large-scale disaster.

321
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,400
You can construe yourself as virtuous

322
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,560
because of the depth of your concern,

323
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,880
and you can abdicate your responsibility

324
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,280
to actually deal with less self-dramatizing problems

325
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
with the less self-dramatizing problems

326
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,000
that actually constitute problems you could solve and address

327
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,240
if you put your mind to it in the real world.

328
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,760
And there's psychological reasons for assuming...

329
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,520
One of the things you see when people's lives go seriously astray

330
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,920
is that they don't generally...

331
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,040
People generally don't run off a cliff

332
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,440
immediately after doing brilliantly.

333
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,160
What happens is they make one error,

334
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,920
and then they make a more serious error,

335
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,160
and then they repeat that 10,000 times,

336
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,920
and then they're in hell.

337
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,520
And it was their failure to rectify the mini-crisis

338
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,520
all along the way that brings upon the apocalypse in their life.

339
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,640
And I do see a lot of that political posturing

340
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,760
characterizing the modern world,

341
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,280
that people act out the role of world-redeeming savior,

342
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,480
but they're not actually attending to genuine problems

343
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,360
that are right in front of them that they could address

344
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,640
if they acted responsibly.

345
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,960
And then the final theme you developed, you said...

346
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,160
This is very interesting.

347
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,160
You said that the notion of natural disaster,

348
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,520
in some sense, is ill-conceptualized

349
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,200
because there's an ambiguity

350
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,360
about whether, when a disaster occurs,

351
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,800
it's a consequence of the hand of God,

352
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,080
say, in the earthquake or the flood,

353
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,800
or the utter failure of the authorities

354
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,240
to have prepared properly for a foreseeable disaster.

355
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,960
I thought this very clearly when Katrina hit New Orleans

356
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,040
because a hue and cry went up about the catastrophe

357
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,320
of the natural disaster,

358
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,280
but you didn't have to dig very far before you realized

359
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,080
that the reason that that hurricane

360
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,920
was so devastating in New Orleans

361
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,360
was because, well, the dykes hadn't been maintained

362
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,120
and they'd only been built to withstand a one-in-one-century flood

363
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,040
and that the entire infrastructure of the society was corrupt.

364
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,880
And so, you know, in mythological representations,

365
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,920
in deep narratives, there is an identity

366
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
between the evil king and the wicked queen of nature.

367
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,680
They're the same thing.

368
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,840
And so if the king gets wicked enough,

369
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,320
the evil queen of nature arises.

370
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,520
And that's a representation of the fact that

371
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,840
if your state is corrupt,

372
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,240
natural disaster will definitely make itself shown

373
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,160
and that you actually can't distinguish.

374
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,560
There's no distinction between lack of preparation

375
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,880
and a natural disaster in the final analysis.

376
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,520
And corruption and blindness facilitate that nexus.

377
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,680
So the Egyptians had a story.

378
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,320
It's the story upon which their whole culture was funded

379
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,520
that the state corrupted, that's Osiris.

380
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,160
The state corrupted and became willfully blind as it aged.

381
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,800
And then it was overthrown by, that's Osiris,

382
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,600
is overthrown by Seth, who's the precursor of Satan,

383
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,880
and then he rules.

384
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,800
So now the tyrant rules.

385
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,080
And then Isis, who's the queen of the underworld,

386
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,040
she's nature.

387
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,200
She makes herself known again, chaos, right?

388
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,840
With enough disintegration at the sociological level,

389
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,400
then chaos makes itself manifest again.

390
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,040
It's one of the most ancient stories of mankind,

391
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,840
playing out that dichotomy between the tyrant

392
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,280
and natural disaster that you just described.

393
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,840
Let me take those points in order if I can.

394
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,480
I think that the most interesting thing to me

395
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,600
about fantasies, about the end of the world,

396
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,040
about the various millenarian cults through history,

397
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,760
is that they are often accompanied by certain forms

398
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,920
of behavior that one might characterize as ascetic.

399
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,480
So the asceticism is an important part

400
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,640
of many religious and secular movements.

401
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,240
So the end is approaching, the apocalypse is nearing,

402
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,560
and therefore we should fast, or perhaps even flog ourselves,

403
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,760
like the flagellant orders at the time of the Black Death.

404
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,480
And it seemed to me very interesting how many similar patterns

405
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,320
one could see in our time.

406
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,240
Whether you are preoccupied with climate change

407
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,960
or systemic racism doesn't matter.

408
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:30,320
You should engage in some kind of ascetic atonement

409
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,120
in advance of the Great Reckoning.

410
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:40,160
And this, I think, infests a lot of contemporary progressivism.

411
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,320
The desire to eat rabbit food,

412
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,960
to be constantly trying to eliminate things from one's diets.

413
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:58,000
The desire to engage in abstention from reproduction.

414
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,720
We must have children because climate change is so cataclysmic.

415
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,120
So you have these sorts of ascetic behaviors

416
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,960
which you can find in medieval and ancient religion.

417
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,920
So I think that's an important first point.

418
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,720
The second point is that mythology of the sort you describe

419
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,080
in the case of the ancient Egyptian myths

420
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,520
makes a lot of sense if you imagine yourself living

421
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,200
in the prehistoric or very ancient world.

422
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,440
Life expectancy was very short.

423
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,240
Individuals were extraordinarily at risk

424
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,600
from a whole variety of premature forms of mortality.

425
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,160
And the natural world was deeply mysterious

426
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,000
because there was no scientific framework for understanding

427
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,200
anything, the fluctuations in the level of the River Nile,

428
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:57,360
the periodic droughts that afflicted early agricultural societies.

429
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,880
And so you end up with ways of making sense of

430
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,600
an extraordinarily cruel and capricious world.

431
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,560
So I think that's an important reason why myths persist.

432
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,480
They're deeply rooted in our pre-modern experience.

433
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:22,960
And I think that if one tries to think about our present predicament,

434
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:29,440
it's odd that such things have such enduring power over us

435
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,640
because since the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment,

436
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,800
we have a much better handle on the challenges

437
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,240
that a species like ours faces on a planet like ours.

438
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,640
So what's odd is that despite having really quite a good understanding

439
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:53,280
of, say, infectious disease or the ways that hurricanes

440
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,240
strike the Eastern seaboard of the United States,

441
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,520
we seem to be getting worse at handling pandemics and hurricanes.

442
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,560
And that's a really important argument that the book makes.

443
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,600
Compared with the generation of the 1950s,

444
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,560
the generation of the 2010s and 2020s

445
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,280
seemed really quite bad at disaster management

446
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,480
in most Western societies, not only the United States.

447
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,840
It's explaining that that takes us into new territory

448
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,280
because I don't think you can explain the diminishing competence

449
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,160
of the modern state without having a theory of its degeneration.

450
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,080
And that's something that is a really important part of the book.

451
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,760
Okay, so I want to pick up on two of those topics.

452
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:44,080
So the first is you point out that as the apocalyptic vision predominates,

453
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,640
there's a turn to asceticism.

454
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,000
And then you describe, we could say, veganism and vegetarianism.

455
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,520
And the insistence by the environmentalists

456
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,440
that we must engage in degrowth

457
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,520
and that we must produce our standard of living.

458
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:04,560
And yes, okay, but there's a very interesting psychological rationale

459
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:12,640
for that as well, which is that if the old state of being has become corrupt,

460
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,680
so that's the old king.

461
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,600
And now we're threatened by its collapse,

462
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:26,240
then the proper thing to do is to engage in repentance and atonement

463
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:32,480
because what you want to do is you want to offer up your stupid preconceptions

464
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,240
to be destroyed so that you can rectify the corruption

465
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,640
so that you can stave off the disaster.

466
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,560
And so now it's interesting because with the millenarian

467
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,400
and apocalyptic movements on the left,

468
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,040
you have a simultaneous insistence

469
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:55,280
that all sorts of impulsive, pleasure-seeking, licentious behavior

470
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,040
should be centered and prioritized and celebrated.

471
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,520
But at the same time, you have this insistence

472
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,360
that there's a certain kind of asceticism that's also necessary.

473
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,680
And I see in that as a psychologist,

474
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:14,080
I see that as a proper mechanism of repair gone astray.

475
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:21,360
Is that, well, you should always be cutting back in this ascetic way

476
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:27,120
on your idiot excesses locally to improve the manner

477
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,560
in which you conceptualize the world.

478
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,200
That's the continual sacrificial offering

479
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,240
of your own insufficiency and your own stupidity.

480
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,360
And that does renew the world.

481
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,400
And so, but now we've got this dynamic

482
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,240
where we globalize the apocalypse.

483
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
We view the end of the world.

484
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,880
We assume that nothing but a kind of universal asceticism

485
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,960
and atonement will suffice.

486
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,840
That enables us to set local concerns aside,

487
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,400
as we already discussed, and to act irresponsibly.

488
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,280
And maybe that's part of what's producing this inability

489
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:08,880
to actually respond locally and effectively to genuine problems.

490
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,560
You know, in the Old Testament,

491
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,160
there's a second commandment is to not use God's name in vain.

492
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,640
And what that means, as far as I can tell,

493
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,320
is that you shouldn't claim divine motivation

494
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,360
for doing things that are actually self-serving.

495
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,280
You shouldn't attribute sacred motivations

496
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,120
to your own instrumental, impulsive, and self-serving behavior.

497
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,280
And then that's echoed in the New Testament

498
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,000
with the insistence that you shouldn't pray in public.

499
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,840
Now, if you take on the apocalyptic burden and you're virtuous

500
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:47,680
only in consequence of your compassionate concern,

501
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,920
it gives you a perfect excuse to dispense with local responsibility.

502
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,160
And if you dispense with local responsibility,

503
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,880
then you're no longer able to engage

504
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,280
in the concrete problem-solving activities

505
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,560
of the sort that you described.

506
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,920
I mean, what did you conclude when you have a chapter

507
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,840
on developing political incompetence

508
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,080
and also one on a sort of a belief in scientism?

509
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,080
And that seems to me to be part of your attempt

510
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,120
to assess the local failure

511
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,680
while we're concentrating on the global apocalypse.

512
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,280
And so what do you make of that,

513
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,360
that concatenation of causal forces?

514
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,720
There are two things that are going on, I think.

515
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:32,960
One is that the more people refer to the science,

516
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,920
the more you should suspect that they are engaged

517
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,680
in some quasi-religious activity.

518
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,920
Because the notion of some settled body of knowledge

519
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,960
called the science is at odds with the reality

520
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,400
of the scientific method, which is a constant struggle

521
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,280
to falsify hypotheses through experimentation.

522
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,080
During the COVID-19 pandemic, but I think it predates it,

523
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,240
it was already going on in debates about climate,

524
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,520
there was a lot of spurious invocation of the science.

525
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,880
And one might as well have been saying the gods or the deity,

526
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,440
because it was, in fact, quite unscientific thinking

527
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,160
that was going on.

528
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,760
I'll give you an illustration of this.

529
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,560
A great delusion is to imagine that we can prevent

530
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,320
the rise of average temperatures by large scale

531
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,760
asceticism in the West.

532
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,760
We must give up internal combustion engines.

533
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,920
We should give up eating meat and so on.

534
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,840
If we end up buying electric vehicles and solar cells

535
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,840
manufactured in China with electricity generated

536
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,240
by burning ever larger quantities of coal,

537
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,040
the probability of reducing average temperatures is zero.

538
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,200
Because that is, in fact, the perfect illustration

539
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,720
of wrongheadedness in action.

540
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,040
If one accepts the premises of the debates

541
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,280
on the causes of rising temperatures,

542
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,120
it makes no sense at all for us to behave this way.

543
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,520
Our asceticism will make no difference

544
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,600
if it manifests itself as increased burning of coal in China.

545
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,200
So that's the first thing that's going on.

546
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,640
I mean, like, well, or increased burning in coal in Germany,

547
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,440
because that's what's happened with the Green Revolution in Germany.

548
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,000
Exactly.

549
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,840
They shut off the nuclear plants and started up the Lignite plant.

550
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:33,920
So this kind of wrongheadedness leads to all kinds of policy errors

551
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
because people have focused on the satisfaction of asceticism,

552
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,960
the virtue signaling that comes with getting rid of nuclear power stations

553
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,040
or internal combustion engines.

554
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,440
So there's a kind of generalized failure,

555
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,280
which embraces the policy elite to think rationally

556
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,080
about the problems that we're trying to address.

557
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,640
The second problem, which I think is just as important,

558
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,960
is the way the administrative state functions.

559
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,840
If you compare central governments today

560
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,520
with their counterparts of half a century or 70 years ago,

561
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,880
they've become much larger.

562
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,920
They're bloated in terms of the numbers of people employed.

563
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,800
They intervene in many more ways.

564
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,040
There's an enormous corpus of regulation in all western countries.

565
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,040
This administrative state, unwieldy regulatory, is very inefficient.

566
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,160
It's very bad at achieving its intended goals.

567
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,840
That has to do with the way that bureaucracy works

568
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:36,160
and the sclerotic tendencies that the modern state suffers from.

569
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,680
So between the science as a quasi-religious way of thinking

570
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,000
and the administrative state,

571
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,560
we have a very, very dysfunctional approach

572
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,200
to nearly all the problems that confront us.

573
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,920
And that is really the central argument of doom.

574
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,480
It's very significant that in our lifetimes,

575
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,880
governments have got worse at dealing with disasters, not better.

576
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,280
Despite the accumulation of scientific knowledge,

577
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,520
we seem somehow, collectively, to be worse at scientific thinking.

578
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,880
The holidays are rapidly approaching,

579
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,640
but we can find peace and calm in the craziness of the season with Hallow,

580
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,520
the number one Christian prayer app in the world.

581
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,320
Immerse yourself in Christmas and Advent prayers,

582
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,960
meditations, and peaceful Christmas music.

583
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,480
Hallow also offers an extensive library of Bible reading plans

584
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,160
accompanied by insightful reflections and audio-guided meditations.

585
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,960
Whether you're a seasoned Bible reader or just starting your journey,

586
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,960
Hallow provides a platform for you to engage with Scripture like never before.

587
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,640
A great place to start is with Father Mike Schmitz's Bible in a Year,

588
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,880
in which he offers brief daily readings and reflections available on the Hallow app.

589
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,560
The Hallow app also helps you connect with a community of like-minded individuals

590
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,120
sharing experiences, insights, and encouragement along the path to spiritual growth.

591
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,440
This Christmas, join Hallow's Christmas Prayer Challenge, Advent with C.S. Lewis.

592
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,760
For the 25 days leading up to Christmas,

593
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,000
you can focus on the real reason for the season with prayer, meditation,

594
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,240
and Christmas music on Hallow.

595
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,800
Download the app for free at Hallow.com slash Jordan for three months free.

596
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,040
That's Hallow.com slash Jordan.

597
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,920
Okay, so imagine this.

598
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,800
You magnify the size of the apocalypse, so it becomes a world-ending ragnarok.

599
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,440
Then you magnify the size of the bureaucratic state

600
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,520
because you have to in order to deal with that apocalypse.

601
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:36,240
Okay, then because the state is so global and large and so central,

602
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,640
it loses its connection with the real world.

603
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,280
It has no subsidiary organization, and then it flails about pointlessly.

604
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,280
Now, I'm going to walk through a couple of narrative representations of that,

605
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,760
and it'll tie it back to the imagery of Revelation.

606
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,120
You might find this interesting.

607
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,720
So you see that dynamic play out in the opening chapters of Genesis,

608
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,080
because what you have is the descendants of Cain.

609
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,240
So Cain makes improper sacrifices, and he becomes bitter and resentful,

610
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,840
and he turns to technology.

611
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,600
It's Cain's descendants that turn to technology first.

612
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,120
They build the first cities, and then the city becomes corrupt.

613
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,640
It becomes corrupt in the direction of the Tower of Babel.

614
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,440
Now, the Tower of Babel is a ziggurat.

615
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,520
It's a stepped pyramid, and at that time,

616
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,160
the potentates of the Middle East were competing to build the largest ziggurats.

617
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,640
They were trying to build towers to heaven to glorify themselves,

618
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,000
and that's the subtext of the Tower of Babel story.

619
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:40,160
So what happens is that the ultimate Tower of Babel is erected to reach to the sky,

620
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,640
and that's a challenge to the supremacy of God.

621
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,520
And the consequence of that is that the cosmos,

622
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:56,640
the spirit of the cosmos, the creative producer of the cosmos,

623
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:01,120
makes all those who inhabit the Tower unable to communicate with one another.

624
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,520
So they start to lose even the ability to share concepts,

625
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,440
and this structure collapses.

626
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,000
And it's because that Tower of Babel is too large, it reaches too high,

627
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,960
it's too uniform, and it's destined to failure.

628
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,840
Because that begs the question, what's the alternative to that?

629
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,520
But I would say the entire remaining biblical corpus

630
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,560
is actually an attempt to answer that question, but it's very germane.

631
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,440
Now, that imagery is picked up again in the Book of Revelation.

632
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,680
So one of the central images in the book that I think is very relevant,

633
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,680
imagine that the Book of Revelation is trying to conceptualize the apocalypse as such,

634
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,800
the manner in which things deteriorate before the ultimate disaster.

635
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,880
And so one of the main images is of a seven-headed beast,

636
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,400
and on the back of the beast is the horror of Babylon.

637
00:36:52,480 --> 00:37:00,160
And it's an image of a centralizing state,

638
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,360
a centralizing, a monstrous centralizing state,

639
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,520
that's a good way of thinking about it,

640
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:14,720
with multiple heads, with something like disinhibited licentiousness as its partner.

641
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,080
That's the image.

642
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,720
And so the notion there is that when things deteriorate

643
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,120
to the point where apocalypse is likely,

644
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:26,960
you have the construction of monstrous state-like apparatuses

645
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:33,920
aligned with individual fragmentation down to the point of licentious atomization.

646
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,920
That's a good way of thinking about it.

647
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,320
So you're striving towards, it seems to me in your argument,

648
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,560
you're striving towards the hypothesis

649
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,640
that there's something like an out-of-control gigantism

650
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:55,040
that's causally related to the inability of these bureaucratic organizations

651
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,880
to actually respond to actual occurrences in the world.

652
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,040
So two thoughts.

653
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,400
There's only one law of history.

654
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,280
I'm a historian, and that's the law of unintended consequences.

655
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:11,600
And so what typically happens is that well-intentioned people

656
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,400
come to power, identify a problem which they feel they must address,

657
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,680
and they undertake measures to address the problem

658
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,520
which have unintended consequences.

659
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,560
This was true when back in the 1960s and 70s,

660
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,840
people persuaded themselves that there was a terrible problem of overpopulation

661
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,920
that Malthus was going to be vindicated,

662
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,440
and therefore there had to be drastic population control, especially in Asia.

663
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,120
And that turned out to have all kinds of unintended consequences.

664
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:42,800
In our time, fears not just of climate change,

665
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,480
but of dangerous technological developments have given rise

666
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,040
to a view which my friend Nick Bostrom and Oxford exemplifies,

667
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,880
that we need to have very, very powerful surveillance powers

668
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,920
to prevent bad things from happening,

669
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,200
whether it's to prevent CO2 emissions

670
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,800
in reaching the levels of the net zero program,

671
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,520
or whether it's to stop dangerous research

672
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,760
being done with artificial intelligence,

673
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:18,320
we need to empower the state to have even greater powers of surveillance

674
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,440
than the mid-20th century totalitarian regimes had.

675
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,320
And so one of the key arguments in the book DOOM is that

676
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,040
actually totalitarianism is the thing most to be feared.

677
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:33,600
In the 20th century, totalitarian regimes caused way more premature death

678
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,120
than anything else.

679
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,000
And so the last thing we should want to do in the 21st century

680
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,800
is to create new forms of totalitarianism

681
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:46,160
out of the belief that only an all-seeing state can prevent disaster.

682
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,520
So this is a really, really important argument that the book makes,

683
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,880
and I think it's become even more relevant with the major breakthroughs

684
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,720
we've seen in artificial intelligence in the two years since the book was published.

685
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,160
The other thing that I would say is we want the universe to be moral.

686
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,240
We are very strongly inclined to think when bad things happen to us

687
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:14,000
that they may in fact be retribution for sins that we committed in the past.

688
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:20,720
And even the most rational individual is susceptible to this idea.

689
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,520
I know this because my parents did their very best to raise me

690
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:30,960
as a product of the Scottish Enlightenment, an atheist and a devoted believer

691
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,320
in the scientific method.

692
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,440
But when bad things happen, I have this uneasy sense

693
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,840
that I may have brought it upon myself by transgressing in some way,

694
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,680
illustrating that you can't really escape the Christian legacy

695
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:50,000
unless you travel a very long, long way away from post-Christian civilizations.

696
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,400
Now, it's not, in fact, a moral universe.

697
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,480
This is the bad news.

698
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,280
It's really not.

699
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,040
I mean, a lot of the bad things that happen are random.

700
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,440
They're governed by power laws.

701
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,600
They're extremely difficult to predict.

702
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,200
Wars are, in fact, pretty randomly distributed.

703
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,960
There's no cycle of history that tells you when a war is coming.

704
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,440
Same applies to financial crises.

705
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,200
Wildfires and earthquakes are not normally distributed.

706
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,560
They can't really be thought of in probabilistic terms.

707
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,440
And so much of the terrible stuff that happens to us

708
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,240
has nothing to do with there being a moral universe.

709
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,800
A cancer may strike one of us down in a much shorter timeframe

710
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,000
than we're both tacitly assuming we have.

711
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:40,960
And if we are diagnosed with a terminal cancer,

712
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,640
how will we react to that news?

713
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,960
What if I hear this tomorrow?

714
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,520
It'll be a tremendous shock to me,

715
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,240
mainly because it will render my younger children

716
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,720
much more vulnerable in my absence.

717
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,640
But will I be able to resist the temptation

718
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,080
that I brought it upon myself?

719
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,720
It'll be there in the back of my mind

720
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,000
because I've just inherited from generations that way of thinking.

721
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:10,400
And it's worth adding one little footnote to this.

722
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,320
My friend, the historian Tom Holland,

723
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,080
wrote a nice book recently, Dominion, arguing that

724
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,320
Christian ways of thinking about the world

725
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:24,400
have outlived Christianity in these secular times that we inhabit.

726
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,720
A very good illustration of this point

727
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,240
is how much Calvinism is still out there.

728
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,520
The belief that you belong to the elect,

729
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,440
the people because of predestination

730
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,600
who are insured of salvation, is a very powerful one.

731
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,960
And it persists long after people have ceased to attend

732
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,440
Calvinist church services.

733
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,640
I'm always impressed by the presence

734
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,640
of the self-appointed elect in academic life.

735
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,080
People who have a sense that they are morally superior

736
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,600
to those around them, they do belong to an elite.

737
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:06,480
And their behavior should be, as it were, fitting to that preeminence.

738
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,280
Now, I am a kind of Calvinist atheist.

739
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,720
I come from the west of Scotland

740
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,600
where that kind of thinking was very well established.

741
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,440
I can see the people who think they belong to the elect

742
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,040
all around me in American academic life.

743
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,760
And, of course, the critical idea

744
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,120
which Robert Louis Stevenson gets at in the Master of Ballon Trey

745
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,960
and James Hogg gets in the Confessions of a Justified Sinner

746
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,200
is that the elect are the worst people.

747
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,560
It's the people who think that they belong to the elite

748
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,920
who turn out to be capable of the most diabolical acts.

749
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,920
So, you know, if you have that feeling

750
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,400
that you might belong to the elect,

751
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,560
disabuse yourself of that notion

752
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,760
because it often empowers dreadful acts of cruelty.

753
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,120
Starting a business can be tough,

754
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,840
especially knowing how to run your online storefront.

755
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,560
Thanks to Shopify, it's easier than ever.

That's Shopify.com-JBP.

775
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,640
I presume that's why the Gospel in Joinder

776
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,200
is that the last will be first, right,

777
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,480
and the first will be last.

778
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,160
It's pointing to something like that.

779
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,920
There's a couple of themes you developed.

780
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,320
So you pointed out that it's often the reaction to a crisis

781
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,840
that's worse than the crisis,

782
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,880
and you pointed to the law of unintended consequences

783
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,000
as the cause of that.

784
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:18,560
And I think there's something technically true about that

785
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,400
in that there isn't a very large number

786
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,080
of possible consequences of any given act.

787
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,160
And the probability that you can specify the consequence

788
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,640
you want and only that consequence

789
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,480
diminishes with the complexity of the action.

790
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,200
And you can see even systems as sophisticated

791
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,320
as the immune system falling prey

792
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,120
to the law of unintended consequences

793
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,800
because sometimes people die when they're infected

794
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,680
by an organism because the immune system overreacts.

795
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,440
And the COVID overreaction was a generalized

796
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,920
social immune system overreaction,

797
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,680
and it was much worse than the hypothetical crisis itself.

798
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,360
But what I wanted to focus on was the reason

799
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,080
that that overreach occurs.

800
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,800
Now, I've been writing a book about biblical narratives,

801
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,160
so they're very much on my mind,

802
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,760
and that's partly why I'm bringing them up.

803
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:23,520
But I talked to a good friend of mine and his brother,

804
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,560
Jonathan Pascio and Matthew Pascio,

805
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,600
about the first apocalyptic cataclysm

806
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,760
as it's laid out in the book of Genesis,

807
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:38,000
and that's the Sin of Eve and the Consequent Sin of Adam.

808
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:41,920
Their view is that the Sin of Eve is one of pride,

809
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,840
is that she encounters the serpent who turns out to be Satan.

810
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,480
So it's the possibility of predation

811
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,400
and natural catastrophe allied with the possibility of evil.

812
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,720
That's a good way of thinking about it symbolically.

813
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,160
And her first presumption

814
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:05,040
is that she can encompass that and hearken to it

815
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,480
and listen to its voice and integrate it.

816
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,880
And that's what produces the fall.

817
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,240
And Adam's Consequent Sin, as he agrees with Eve,

818
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,280
and I would say mostly to try to impress her,

819
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,760
which speaks very deeply to the motivation of men.

820
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,680
And so there's this notion, it's a very, very interesting notion.

821
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,280
And I'd like to know what you make of it,

822
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,640
is that the fundamental reason that cataclysms occur,

823
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,920
and I guess this is an objection to your theory of an amoral world.

824
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,920
So we'll see where this goes,

825
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,720
is that it's people's overreaching pride

826
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,680
that is the eternal precursor to the fall.

827
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,440
You know, pride goes before a fall.

828
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,360
But it's this notion that we can fight off more than we can chew,

829
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,880
that we can encapsulate and control more than we're really competent to.

830
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,280
We have an over-expansive vision of our competence.

831
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:03,360
We trumpet that to parade our moral virtue.

832
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,640
It motivates us to overextend ourselves in places we shouldn't.

833
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:14,240
And the constant consequence of that is systemic collapse

834
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,600
at different scales.

835
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,400
And so it begs the question, you know, I've really wondered about this,

836
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:25,440
and you know, if you, I think it's something to meditate on,

837
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,640
if you didn't overreach in your life,

838
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:34,960
you know, if you were properly humble in your claims of mastery,

839
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,080
if you only dealt with what was local

840
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,160
and that was within your bounds of competence,

841
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,760
you know, maybe extending yourself a bit to learn,

842
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:47,280
maybe you wouldn't bring on yourself a continual sequence

843
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,920
of relatively apocalyptic catastrophes, right?

844
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,560
It's like, and you pointed to that at the end

845
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,000
of your last sequence of comments.

846
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,720
You know, you said, there's a tension there.

847
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,440
You said, well, the universe is full of random events

848
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,520
and it's not essentially moral.

849
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,680
But you also said, but we overreach constantly

850
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,360
and that does produce, you know, various forms of cataclysm.

851
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,440
So I would say, see, there's a paradox in those two viewpoints

852
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,360
because how about this?

853
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,720
Is how about our immorality makes us more susceptible

854
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,240
to the random fluctuations of the world, right?

855
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,960
That joins those two visions together.

856
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:29,920
I think it's rather different from the way you've put it.

857
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:37,120
It's often people with a strong sense of morality who overreach.

858
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,800
Humility is important.

859
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,720
We need to be humble about our ability

860
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,880
to predict the consequences of our actions.

861
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,520
It's a nonlinear world, but we are quite linear thinkers

862
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,560
and we love to say other things being equal,

863
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,400
this act will have the following consequence.

864
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,120
But of course, other things are not equal in a complex system.

865
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,080
Let me give you an illustration of this point,

866
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,720
which is currently in people's minds

867
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,960
because of the success of the movie Oppenheimer.

868
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,560
Oppie Oppenheimer was a very moral individual,

869
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:17,840
at least he felt himself to be rooted in an ethical education

870
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,960
that he'd had at an elite school in New York,

871
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:30,800
drawn out of those ethical premises towards communism in the 1930s.

872
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,440
But when given the challenge to build an atomic bomb

873
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,120
in order to win World War II,

874
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:44,720
he embraced that challenge and achieved it with astonishing brilliance,

875
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:49,120
brilliance both as a scientist and as it turned out as a leader of scientists.

876
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,920
But he quickly began to see, after the bomb had been dropped

877
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,120
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that there were unintended consequences.

878
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,680
He was unable to prevent the arms race

879
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,360
that soon broke out between the United States and the Soviet Union.

880
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:10,960
He was unable to prevent the invention of the thermonuclear bomb, the super.

881
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:16,640
He lost the arguments about the development of nuclear weapons.

882
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,960
And if one looks back at that era,

883
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:24,160
the single most amazing thing to me about that breakthrough

884
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:28,160
is that we have subsequently made so much more use

885
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,840
of the destructive potential of nuclear fission

886
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,400
than of its productive potential.

887
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:40,000
We've built many, many more nuclear warheads than nuclear reactors.

888
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:43,440
That illustrates, I think, very powerfully the law of unintended consequences.

889
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,080
But it began with an individual, Oppenheimer,

890
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,280
who was filled with a sense of his own morality

891
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,800
and took that sense with him to the grave.

892
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,360
Right, okay, but maybe that, okay,

893
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,520
but you're pointing to something there

894
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,600
that is akin to a point you made earlier,

895
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:06,480
is that you said that he was filled with a sense of his own morality.

896
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:10,880
And I can understand why that might be associated

897
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,680
with the totalitarian temptation

898
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,120
of religious dogmatism and Calvinism, let's say.

899
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,480
But I could say, perhaps I could say in response,

900
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,160
he should have been filled instead

901
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,160
with a sense of his own potential sinfulness, right?

902
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,360
And I would also say that,

903
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,880
and you can tell me what you think about this,

904
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,600
because these are ideas that I'm just trying to develop,

905
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,360
is that you already told me that as far as you're concerned,

906
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,800
it's the very people who regard themselves as the elect and the saved

907
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,640
and the already moral who are most likely to overreach

908
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,480
and who present the biggest danger.

909
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,040
You followed that up with a description of Oppenheimer, right?

910
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:50,560
This incredible Luciferian intellect,

911
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,000
and that's the proper symbolic representation

912
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,760
who engaged in this world-destroying scheme

913
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,920
and then was potentially world-destroying scheme

914
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,840
and was unable to control it.

915
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,840
But you characterized him as convinced of his own moral virtue.

916
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,080
So I would say, okay, well, if that's the problem,

917
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,840
maybe he should have been convinced of the opposite of that,

918
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,680
which would be his intrinsic insufficiency and sinfulness.

919
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,360
Now, there is a continual injunction throughout the biblical corpus

920
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,800
to do precisely that.

921
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,880
And the reason I'm bringing that up, too,

922
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,800
is because something else that you said begs a question, you know?

923
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,600
If the law of unintended consequence rules,

924
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:37,200
then under what conditions is action, any action, not overreach, right?

925
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,240
Because you could say, this is combinatorial explosion,

926
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:46,080
you can't predict the consequence of any action, and yet you have to act.

927
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,640
And so then the question emerges,

928
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,800
well, since you have to act,

929
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,440
but there's the danger of exponentially cascading unintended consequences,

930
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,080
in what spirit should you act?

931
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,040
And you've already pointed out, well, it shouldn't be in the spirit

932
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:07,600
of smug, self-satisfied, Calvinistic, dogmatic certainty in your moral right.

933
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,800
Well, then what should it be?

934
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,360
Well, hopefully it should be the opposite of that.

935
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,400
You know, and that is a kind of radical humility, right?

936
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,200
It's an openness to the possibility of error.

937
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,000
I mean, I don't know exactly how those things should be calibrated,

938
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,720
but because we do have to act,

939
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,120
and it does seem to me that there is a domain of action.

940
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:30,560
Like, what do you think it was that Oppenheimer did wrong, fundamentally?

941
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,080
I mean, I characterize his intellect as Luciferian, right?

942
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:40,880
He's reaching for a power that, in principle,

943
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,440
I don't know if it should have been forever off limits.

944
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,520
I have no idea how to adjudicate that.

945
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:50,640
But you have a sense that Oppenheimer himself recognized that he had,

946
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,400
it wasn't that he had too much faith in the comprehensiveness of his intellect,

947
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,120
that he was too tempted by the power that was offered to him

948
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:01,280
as a consequence of being developer of this immense weapon.

949
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,440
Where do you think he went wrong?

950
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,720
That's key to the question of where science itself goes wrong.

951
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,360
I should be, I haven't watched the movie,

952
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,000
but I read the book American Prometheus.

953
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,800
I prefer books to movies.

954
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,280
And the book makes it clear that what Oppenheimer got wrong

955
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,800
was to flirt with communism.

956
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:28,320
And that was wrong because it was the moment when he set aside

957
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:33,840
his scientific judgment and drank at least some of the snake oil

958
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:38,320
that the Soviet regime was successfully exporting in the 1930s.

959
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,920
This was a terrible mistake that ultimately undermined his credibility

960
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:48,480
and limited his power to steer the course of the nuclear race.

961
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,400
What he got right was to develop a bomb that could end World War II

962
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,600
without the need for a large-scale conventional forces invasion of Japan

963
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:01,520
which would have cost untold numbers of American soldiers' lives.

964
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,000
And I think it's very important to emphasize

965
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:07,280
that if Oppenheimer had said to himself,

966
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:15,040
I must be humble and resist the temptation to win this race.

967
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,640
And of course, a number of physicists did take that view

968
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,040
and refused to participate in the Manhattan Project.

969
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,880
It might have been disastrous.

970
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:28,320
I constantly try to remind people in the work I've done on the Second World War

971
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,640
that the Axis powers, the Totalitarian powers, nearly won that war.

972
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,320
And it took tremendous creativity by a whole range of scientists,

973
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,320
not only Oppenheimer, but think of touring those cryptographers

974
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:45,600
who did such a crucial job of making sure that the Allied powers cracked

975
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,360
or the Axis powers codes.

976
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:52,560
It took a huge effort to win that war.

977
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:59,840
The critical thing, I think, comes from another secular Jewish intellect,

978
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,480
Henry Kissinger, whose biography I've spent a large part of my career writing.

979
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:10,000
In the 1950s and 60s, Kissinger, before he entered the realm of power,

980
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,280
came up with the idea of the problem of conjecture.

981
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,440
It's an extremely important idea

982
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,840
that should be communicated to any decision maker,

983
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,640
whether they're in the private sector or the public sector.

984
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,920
And the problem of conjecture says that at any given moment

985
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,200
when one must take a decision, there is a kind of asymmetry.

986
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,760
And the asymmetry arises from the fact that if you act,

987
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:41,680
let's say if you had acted in 1938 to prevent Hitler's takeover of Czechoslovakia,

988
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,280
there would have been a cost.

989
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,920
The war would have begun earlier.

990
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,880
And even if you had successfully prevented a much larger war,

991
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,120
the World War that broke out in 1939,

992
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,760
you would have got no real gratitude for that.

993
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:59,520
You get no payoffs for the averted catastrophe.

994
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,080
Your preemptive action has a cost,

995
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,640
and that you're held responsible for.

996
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,200
The tempting thing, particularly in a democratic system,

997
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,520
is to do nothing, hope for the best, because that has a low cost.

998
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:16,000
And if disaster nevertheless happens, if you're unlucky,

999
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,360
then you say to yourself,

1000
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,960
well, anybody in my position would have made the same error.

1001
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,600
So the cost of preemption is high,

1002
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,400
and you have to take a decision conjecturally.

1003
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,160
Because you can't know that in acting in 1938,

1004
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,040
you avert a much larger and more dangerous war.

1005
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,640
You cannot have that certainty,

1006
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,640
and there are no data that will tell you.

1007
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,280
So I think decision-making under uncertainty

1008
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:43,520
is the hardest thing of all, but it has to be done.

1009
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,720
And I think what I've learned from Kissinger is that

1010
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:51,760
you will be held responsible and judged very harshly

1011
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,240
for those actions you take.

1012
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,800
Even if they avert disaster, you won't get thanked.

1013
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,160
Nobody ever will thank Henry Kissinger for avoiding World War III.

1014
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,280
Nobody will, I think, ever thank any statesman

1015
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,040
for avoiding calamity.

1016
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,240
They will only blame them for the actions that they took.

1017
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,640
And here's the final point that Kissinger makes.

1018
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,720
Most choices in the realm of power are between evils.

1019
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,880
You just have to decide which is the greater

1020
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,320
and which is the lesser.

1021
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,120
There are very frequently no good options.

1022
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,680
I think that's very clear today in the Middle East

1023
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,880
since we're talking at a time of fresh disaster in that region.

1024
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,720
There are no good choices facing the Israeli government

1025
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,120
or even the government of the United States.

1026
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,520
But there's no option to do nothing.

1027
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,960
I think that must be clear.

1028
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,840
Let me take apart what you just said.

1029
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:51,920
And so the first thing you brought up is that Oppenheimer flirted with,

1030
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,680
let's call it, radical left utopianism.

1031
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,880
Now, that's very interesting because I would say that's true

1032
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,480
of intellectuals across the West and has been since the...

1033
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,800
What? I don't know.

1034
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,720
The last 100 years, and it's certainly something

1035
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:14,720
that characterizes the academia at the moment.

1036
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,520
I mean, Larry Summers came out two days ago,

1037
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:21,360
the former president of Harvard, savaging Harvard

1038
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:25,520
as a consequence of its descent into this radical leftist,

1039
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,120
statist utopian vision.

1040
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:34,240
So there's something key to the presumption of the intellect

1041
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,600
and belief in a state-imposed utopia.

1042
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:38,960
So that's one thing.

1043
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,880
Then you said sequence of things that were very, very complicated.

1044
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:49,680
The first was, well, inaction also produces a combinatorial explosion.

1045
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,240
So we're stuck with the necessity of action.

1046
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,440
So that's a big problem.

1047
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,560
That brings up the issue again, is then under what conditions

1048
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,840
is action appropriate?

1049
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:06,000
Then you said you're also not rewarded for preventative action

1050
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:09,360
because in part because nobody can tell what you prevented

1051
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,640
if it doesn't happen, right?

1052
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,600
And so there's no public virtue in that.

1053
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:17,680
And that entices the leaders of modern states

1054
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:21,680
to forestall action because they'll be blamed for action

1055
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:25,120
and then maybe to react precipitously once it's too late.

1056
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,200
So then again, we're back to the central question here,

1057
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:36,880
at least in part, which is how do you organize your attention

1058
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:42,560
and sequence your action so that overreach is least likely?

1059
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,440
Now, you discussed Kissinger in that regard

1060
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:49,520
and said that he was constantly choosing between evils

1061
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,400
and regarded that as a necessity of statescraft.

1062
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,280
You have to conduct yourself.

1063
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,240
We talked earlier about this idea that there's a tremendous

1064
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:06,320
moral hazard in praying in public and signaling virtue to yourself

1065
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,840
and demanding recognition for your positive actions.

1066
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:16,480
And you said that prevention doesn't produce public claim.

1067
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:20,000
That what that has to mean, at least in part,

1068
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,320
is that you have to be oriented to act properly

1069
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:27,520
despite its reputational advantage or cost, right?

1070
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,880
See, that's exactly it, is that something other than reputation

1071
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,560
has to motivate your action.

1072
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,800
And then the question is, what should motivate your action

1073
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:40,800
if it's not status, power, and reputation, right?

1074
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,560
That's exactly right. That's where that should...

1075
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:47,040
Inoch Powell said all political careers end in failure.

1076
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:53,520
I think that any leader should reconcile himself or herself

1077
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:58,400
to ultimate failure because doing the right thing,

1078
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,000
averting disaster, will not get you rewarded.

1079
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,720
And I think this is just to...

1080
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,280
So then why bother? Why bother doing the right thing?

1081
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,840
And how do you even determine what the right thing is

1082
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,200
if it's not associated with public acclaim?

1083
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,400
What would right be?

1084
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,480
Because it must have ultimately been right for Churchill

1085
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:22,720
to speak out against appeasement, as he did throughout the 1930s,

1086
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:26,960
to take the helm in 1940 when all his predictions had been fulfilled

1087
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:30,240
and Britain had been brought to the brink of catastrophe,

1088
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:34,240
to lead Britain to an ultimate victory in 1945,

1089
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:37,680
and then suffer a massive electoral defeat.

1090
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,360
This is a noble story.

1091
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,320
And I think that's what any leader should aspire to,

1092
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,040
to be right on the basis of historical judgment,

1093
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:52,080
to accept that there will not necessarily be triumphal processions,

1094
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:55,440
that there may, in fact, be ignominy at the end of the road,

1095
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:58,800
but to have done the right thing, to save your nation

1096
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,680
and get no thanks for it, that seems to be the most

1097
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,920
that any leader can aspire to.

1098
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,200
Okay, okay, okay.

1099
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,840
Well, I've got two comments about that,

1100
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,040
and then we'll wrap this part of the interview out.

1101
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:13,200
I understand that you have a hard out.

1102
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:18,080
You described Churchill's actions in terms of ultimate right,

1103
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:21,840
and so you made reference to a concept of ultimate right.

1104
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:25,040
And then you turned to a particular concept of ultimate right,

1105
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:30,640
which was a form of extreme self-sacrifice with no public acclaim.

1106
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:33,040
I gotta say, those are strange things for someone

1107
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:36,800
who also said during the same discussion,

1108
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,840
who proclaimed a kind of central atheism,

1109
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,960
because I can't help seeing echoes in that of,

1110
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,600
while the Christian passion, for example,

1111
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:50,240
is that you're called upon to do right at your own expense,

1112
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,320
even your own ultimate expense,

1113
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,520
with no hope of public acclaim,

1114
01:04:55,600 --> 01:05:00,080
and you do that in the service of something that's ultimately right.

1115
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:06,000
And so, well, that's a parallel that occurred to me

1116
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,040
when you made the argument.

1117
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:08,240
That's a perfectly shrewd observation.

1118
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,080
I'm a lapsed atheist, Jordan.

1119
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,600
I go to church every Sunday,

1120
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,680
precisely because having been brought up an atheist,

1121
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,320
I came to realize in my career as an historian,

1122
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,000
not only that atheism is a disastrous basis for a society,

1123
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,920
atheist societies have probably committed

1124
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,560
more violations of human rights than there are any others,

1125
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,680
but also because I don't think it can be a basis

1126
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,080
for individual ethical decision-making.

1127
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,640
Church was a Christian,

1128
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,880
and I think has to be understood as such.

1129
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:42,080
So I am a lapsed atheist and proud of it.

1130
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:44,640
Ah, okay.

1131
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:47,200
Well, you know, it turns out I wanted to talk to you

1132
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,680
for the additional half an hour that I usually use,

1133
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,160
but that's actually just a perfectly fine place

1134
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,240
to bring this part of the conversation to an end.

1135
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,840
I would be more than happy to talk to you again

1136
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,520
in some greater detail.

1137
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,240
There's obviously many other things that we could explore.

1138
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,840
For everyone watching and listening,

1139
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:07,120
most of you know that I'm going to continue

1140
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:11,120
to talk to Dr. Ferguson on the Daily Wire.

1141
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,360
I want to understand more deeply

1142
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,720
where his interests in such topics

1143
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,960
arose during the course of his life.

1144
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:21,280
I usually use an autobiographical approach

1145
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:23,120
in that half an hour.

1146
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,440
So if those of you who are watching and listening

1147
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,200
would like to join us on the Daily Wire side,

1148
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,320
that would be great.

1149
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,240
Otherwise, Neil, thank you very much

1150
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,000
for a very stimulating conversation.

1151
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:35,200
Thank you to everyone who's paid attention

1152
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,800
and devoted some time to walking through this podcast with us.

1153
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,240
Thanks, Jordan.
