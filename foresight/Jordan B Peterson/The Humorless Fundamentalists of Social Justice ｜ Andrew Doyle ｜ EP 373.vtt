00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
I mean, you mentioned, interestingly, people like Joe Rogan and Russell Brown being considered

00:04.400 --> 00:11.760
a gateway to the alt-right. They're still traditionally politically more akin to the left,

00:11.760 --> 00:16.320
but because they've deviated slightly, you have this kind of puritanical sledgehammer coming

00:16.320 --> 00:23.040
down and saying, no, you're straying from what our ideology says you should believe.

00:23.040 --> 00:25.920
And that, to me, also feels like a fundamentalist religion.

00:30.720 --> 00:45.440
Hello to everyone watching and listening. Today I'm speaking, once again, because we've done it

00:45.440 --> 00:51.040
before, with playwright, journalist and political satirist Andrew Doyle, also known as Titania

00:51.040 --> 00:59.040
McGrath. We discuss the intentional irrationality of the far-left doctrines that use religious

00:59.040 --> 01:05.440
rhetoric and practices, despite the absence of God, or perhaps the presence of a different God,

01:06.160 --> 01:12.640
their paramount desire to dismantle societal structures, regardless of need or merit,

01:13.920 --> 01:16.800
the argument for transcendence inherent in the pursuit of art,

01:17.520 --> 01:24.560
and how woke culture stifles genuine expression, forcing dogma to take the place of fundamental

01:24.560 --> 01:31.600
truce and, say, purposefully doing so. Looking forward to it. Well, Mr. Doyle, it's good to see

01:31.600 --> 01:36.480
you again. I think we're damn near friends, or at least I like you. I don't know what you think

01:36.480 --> 01:40.320
about me, but... The feeling's very much mutual, Jordan. Thank you so much for having me.

01:41.040 --> 01:44.480
Well, that's good. Well, us reprehensible types, you know, we need to stick together.

01:44.480 --> 01:50.480
We do. Yeah. Yeah, that's for sure. So, the first, I thought I'd hassle you for a bit. First,

01:51.280 --> 01:57.280
I got two things to hassle you about, I think. The first is, it says on your Wikipedia page,

01:57.280 --> 02:03.280
for whatever that's worth, that you regard yourself as left-wing, and so I think you deserve

02:03.280 --> 02:08.320
some harassment for that. But also, I don't know what the hell that means anymore. And then,

02:08.320 --> 02:12.240
after I've done bugging you about that, I thought I'd bother you about having a PhD in

02:12.240 --> 02:17.840
early Renaissance poetry and make the humiliation complete. Okay, let's start with the left-wing

02:17.840 --> 02:22.960
thing. Okay, yes. Well, firstly, I'd say that Wikipedia is full of errors. I wouldn't trust

02:22.960 --> 02:27.440
absolutely everything you see on Wikipedia. However, on that score, I think it's broadly

02:27.440 --> 02:35.360
accurate. I know that, I mean, I've never voted for a right-wing party. I did vote for Jeremy Corbyn,

02:35.360 --> 02:42.480
which, to be honest, I now regret. As you should. I think if you were to... I'm with you. I don't

02:42.480 --> 02:46.480
really know what left-wing and right-wing means anymore. I think the culture war has, in fact,

02:46.480 --> 02:50.880
obliterated those two designations. I really do believe that because, you know, if you were to

02:51.600 --> 02:58.400
write down my views on most subjects and sort of give them to an impartial observer and say,

02:58.400 --> 03:02.400
is this person on the left or on the right? I think broadly speaking, most of my values

03:02.400 --> 03:08.160
would fall into what traditionally would be considered left-wing. I think I have some sort of

03:08.160 --> 03:12.240
more conservative values when it comes to culture and education and the arts, perhaps.

03:12.240 --> 03:15.920
But that's the same as someone like George Orwell, who was very much a cultural conservative,

03:15.920 --> 03:21.520
as well as being a socialist. I think economically speaking, I do believe in

03:22.320 --> 03:27.680
fair disproportionate taxation of the wealthy. I do believe in the welfare state.

03:29.520 --> 03:34.960
All of those sort of, I believe, in redressing economic inequality, looking out for working

03:34.960 --> 03:39.120
class people, social mobility. So all of these kind of things, I think, would traditionally be

03:39.120 --> 03:43.520
deemed to be left-wing. But I think what the culture war has effectively done is

03:44.400 --> 03:53.520
it's substituted identity, group identity, for the notion of class and money. And what that now

03:53.520 --> 03:58.320
means is that people who describe themselves as left-wing are nothing of the kind. I mean,

03:58.320 --> 04:03.360
most of the activists that you see, the sort of most vociferous cheerleaders of the critical

04:03.360 --> 04:08.400
social justice movement tend to be, well, let's put it nicely, quite posh. They tend to have

04:08.400 --> 04:12.480
quite plummy voices, double-barreled names. They're called things like Hugo Pondsford and

04:12.560 --> 04:16.640
Sage Willoughby and things like this, particularly the case with environmental activists. You know,

04:16.640 --> 04:21.760
there's people who glue themselves to Van Gogh paintings and the statue of David or whatever

04:21.760 --> 04:26.320
it might be. When they talk, they are almost like a caricature, like the kind of thing that I would

04:26.320 --> 04:33.120
have invented as a joke of a kind of fact. And have invented, in fact. Exactly. Well, Tatania

04:33.120 --> 04:40.640
McGrath has that name because she's very, very well off. Part of the joke with that and part of

04:40.640 --> 04:44.320
what I find so funny about so many of these activists is that they are bleeding about

04:45.360 --> 04:51.440
oppression and persecution and privilege, and they're independently wealthy. They've got,

04:51.440 --> 04:54.640
they've had everything handed to them on a plate. They're not in a position to do that.

04:54.640 --> 05:02.000
Andrew, you know, look, I noticed this when I was teaching at Harvard, at Ivy League

05:02.000 --> 05:10.160
school, obviously. And so all of my students were the top 1%, obviously. And if they weren't at that

05:10.160 --> 05:17.360
moment, they were going to be by the time they were 40. So at worst, they were top 1% in what would

05:17.360 --> 05:23.520
you call infancy. There we go. And so you might think that'd be good enough on the privilege side,

05:23.520 --> 05:30.720
but it seems to me that there's a small coterie of very noisy people for whom being rich and

05:30.720 --> 05:36.320
privileged is not enough. They also want all the victimization privileges of being oppressed,

05:36.320 --> 05:41.520
because then you can have bloody well everything, can't you? And if you're a narcissistic psychopath,

05:41.520 --> 05:46.640
then everything is what you want and you want it now. And I want to just follow up on that a bit

05:46.640 --> 05:52.400
with regards to this left-wing issue. So, you know, there's about a dozen studies now. I want to

05:52.400 --> 05:55.760
write an article about this or maybe even a book. There's about a dozen studies now

05:56.640 --> 06:00.640
looking at the personality predictors of left-wing authoritarianism.

06:01.600 --> 06:09.920
And so from the end of World War II till 2016, social psychologists in particular,

06:09.920 --> 06:16.080
and that's a rather dismal discipline, denied the existence of left-wing authoritarianism outright.

06:16.080 --> 06:23.200
It was only a right-wing phenomenon, apparently. You know, I mean, Stalin and Mao, notwithstanding.

06:23.200 --> 06:28.560
But it started to switch a bit in 2016. We did a study in my lab, first of all, showing that

06:28.560 --> 06:34.480
left-wing authoritarianism was a coherent, you could identify a coherent set of beliefs

06:34.480 --> 06:40.160
statistically that were associated with so-called progressive causes allied with the willingness

06:40.160 --> 06:45.840
to impose them using force, fear, force, and compulsion. So that's not a bad definition of

06:45.840 --> 06:50.880
left-wing authoritarianism. But then a number of other studies have come out, and the most

06:50.880 --> 06:57.200
interesting ones concentrate on what's known as the dark tetrad. And the dark tetrad is a group

06:57.200 --> 07:01.680
of personality traits that were too evil to make it into the standard personality models.

07:01.680 --> 07:08.400
They were excluded by fiat to begin with. Manipulativeness, that's Machiavellianism.

07:08.400 --> 07:14.720
Psychopathy, which is predatory parasitism. Narcissism, that was the original dark tet

07:14.720 --> 07:20.320
triad. But that wasn't bad enough, so the psychologists had to add sadism to it to fill

07:20.320 --> 07:28.240
in the last quadrant. And the correlation between dark tetrad personality traits and left-wing

07:28.240 --> 07:35.200
authoritarianism is so high that it isn't obvious that they're distinguishable. And so what I see

07:35.200 --> 07:39.200
is... Is it not similarly high amongst right-wing authoritarianism?

07:39.200 --> 07:43.040
No, it's not. So it's a different kind of authoritarianism?

07:44.000 --> 07:50.400
Yes. I mean, this isn't clearly laid out yet, but the focus at the moment...

07:51.040 --> 07:56.400
I think, first of all, anybody who's willing to use fear and compulsion and force

07:57.120 --> 08:03.200
is likely to also be characterized by those dark tetrad traits. But I think the additional

08:03.200 --> 08:08.160
pathology that emerges on the left, and this is something we can discuss, obviously, is that

08:09.040 --> 08:18.480
you have to be a particular kind of evil snake to mask your psychopathic power-mongering in the

08:18.480 --> 08:24.000
guise of compassion. And I don't think the right-wing authoritarians do that. They more or less come

08:24.000 --> 08:28.240
right out and say, like, fuck you, I'm going to take everything you have, especially if you're

08:28.240 --> 08:32.880
a group I don't like. But the left-wing types, they say, well, you know, really, I'm your best

08:32.880 --> 08:37.840
friend. Historically speaking, is that necessarily the case? I mean, you know, if you take the example

08:37.920 --> 08:44.480
of the Third Reich and Nazism, that was underpinned by a belief, a sincere belief,

08:44.480 --> 08:47.920
a sort of quasi-religious belief that what they were doing was for the good of society.

08:47.920 --> 08:49.760
However, abhorrent, we might find it.

08:50.720 --> 08:55.040
Look, fair enough, man, I know perfectly well that in the 1930s, for example,

08:55.040 --> 09:00.960
as the Nazis marched towards the death camps, their primary rationale for the

09:01.920 --> 09:08.640
original implementation of youth in Asia, so to speak, of mass killing was compassionate

09:08.640 --> 09:13.040
youth in Asia. But then I would also say, and this is something we actually don't know,

09:13.520 --> 09:20.080
you know, that the Nazis were national socialists and their political stance was a weird mixture of

09:20.080 --> 09:25.920
what we would think of as left and right-wing now, right? I mean, there was the fascist component

09:26.320 --> 09:30.720
that involved the aggregation of power at the pinnacle, corporate and governmental,

09:30.720 --> 09:34.800
and media, all of that, right? So that seems kind of right-wing and monolithic.

09:35.360 --> 09:42.480
But it wasn't like they were, it wasn't, there were socialist elements in the platform as well.

09:42.480 --> 09:47.200
And so we don't know enough to sort that out, I would say, maybe on the statistical side.

09:47.200 --> 09:51.440
But doesn't all of this sort of point to the fact, or not even the fact, but my contention,

09:51.440 --> 09:54.880
that actually thinking in terms of left and right when it comes to this

09:54.880 --> 09:57.200
is kind of redundant. I think in a way you've sort of hit it.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.320
Yeah, exactly.

09:58.320 --> 10:02.480
Because the debate has always been the struggle between liberty and authority.

10:02.480 --> 10:06.000
And so, you know, to go back to whether I'm left-wing or right-wing, I think I'm probably

10:06.000 --> 10:09.280
just liberal. I think there are liberal-minded people on the left, there are liberal-minded

10:09.280 --> 10:14.240
people on the right among libertarians. It's not something that is tied to a left-right worldview.

10:14.960 --> 10:20.160
But when I hear people talking about how trying to frame the culture war in terms of left and

10:20.160 --> 10:24.240
right, or to say that the culture war doesn't matter and there are more important things,

10:24.240 --> 10:28.240
actually, this struggle between liberty and authority, which John Stuart Mill talks about

10:28.240 --> 10:33.680
in his book on liberty. George Orwell has written about this. That's the thing that matters. And

10:33.680 --> 10:38.800
the recognition that there is an authoritarian impulse in humanity, that there is an enduring

10:38.800 --> 10:42.960
appeal to authoritarianism, whether you come from the left or from the right, this is something

10:42.960 --> 10:47.200
that George Orwell has to go back to. He tackled this as well. It's precisely the reason why,

10:47.200 --> 10:50.960
when he wrote Animal Farm, he couldn't get it published for so long because people were horrified

10:50.960 --> 10:55.440
by the possibility that left-wing people could be authoritarian. And what he was saying is that

10:55.440 --> 11:03.120
this is something that doesn't... It's irrespective of a left-wing view or a right-wing view. And I

11:03.120 --> 11:06.880
think although you might be able to pinpoint psychological differences and tendencies among

11:06.880 --> 11:11.040
those on the left who have an authoritarian bent and those on the right who have a similar

11:11.040 --> 11:16.160
authoritarian bent, perhaps it's more useful just to think, particularly when it comes to the culture

11:16.160 --> 11:20.560
war, in terms of who believes in traditional liberal values. I know that means something very

11:20.560 --> 11:27.280
different in America, but liberal values insofar as individual autonomy, shared humanity, freedom,

11:27.280 --> 11:33.280
freedom of expression, freedom of the press, etc. Those kind of liberal values you can do whatever

11:33.280 --> 11:37.600
you want with your life, so long as it does not impinge upon the rights of others. That's something

11:37.600 --> 11:44.080
that left and right can agree on. And the social justice warriors, whilst they might call themselves

11:44.080 --> 11:48.400
left-wing, really their movement is characterized by authoritarianism. They oppose those liberal

11:48.400 --> 11:51.280
values. Well, that's what it looks like. And quite... Well, not just what it looks like, quite

11:51.280 --> 11:57.280
explicitly. I mean, the early critical race theory texts explicitly say... I mean, if you read Derek

11:57.280 --> 12:02.400
Bell who wrote an essay called Who's Afraid of Critical Race Theory, he talks about how critical

12:02.400 --> 12:07.760
race theorists have always mistrusted liberalism. They see the liberal project as having failed,

12:07.760 --> 12:14.000
because we still live in a society where racism exists. And they take that as evidence that liberalism

12:14.000 --> 12:19.120
doesn't work, rather than... Right, because the previous societies were so non-racist.

12:19.760 --> 12:26.320
Right, exactly. They don't understand that point. The social liberalism is about an ongoing process.

12:26.320 --> 12:29.760
It's about recognizing that we live in an imperfectible world and trying to do our best

12:29.760 --> 12:36.960
with a bad lot. And the problem is that authoritarians tend to be, as well, kind of utopians,

12:36.960 --> 12:40.720
even though in the case of the social justice activists, I don't think they've got a clear

12:40.720 --> 12:47.680
sense of what their final ideal society would look like. At the moment, they just seem to me

12:47.680 --> 12:54.000
to be on a sort of rampage of destruction. Yeah, well, that is what it would look like.

12:54.000 --> 12:59.040
I've always thought that Hitler got exactly what he was aiming at. He shot himself while

12:59.040 --> 13:04.160
Europe was burning. And it's like a big fuck you to God, fundamentally.

13:04.160 --> 13:09.680
Well, that was because he was the personality type that would rather everyone was torn down

13:09.760 --> 13:12.640
rather than he fails. I mean, one of the things that comes in...

13:12.640 --> 13:15.760
Precisely, yeah. Well, that is the dark tetradite, man. That's for sure.

13:15.760 --> 13:20.960
Right. I mean, he was deeply narcissistic. He would ball people with those lectures

13:20.960 --> 13:27.760
late at night when no one was interested. It was all about him. One thing that comes out

13:27.760 --> 13:32.800
very clearly, there's a great biography of Hitler by Ian Kershaw. One thing that very much comes

13:32.800 --> 13:38.560
out about that is this guy was a narcissist. And when he knew that the game was up, he wanted

13:38.560 --> 13:43.200
everyone to pay, all of the German people. That's narcissism right there, man.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.680
That's absolutely right. Well, and he said that, you know? I mean,

13:46.400 --> 13:51.360
at near the end of the Second World War, when the Russians were advancing on Berlin,

13:52.000 --> 13:58.800
he continually expressed his dismay at the uselessness of the German people who had failed him.

13:58.800 --> 14:04.160
Yes, exactly. And those who had failed on the Eastern front or from his perception

14:04.160 --> 14:07.360
had failed, even though he'd put the military in an impossible situation,

14:07.360 --> 14:12.240
couldn't take any responsibility for his own mistakes. But that kind of narcissism,

14:12.240 --> 14:16.480
and I don't like comparing social justice activists to Hitler. I think that's their trick.

14:16.480 --> 14:20.240
That's what they do. They call everyone Hitler. But I think you can definitely see

14:21.040 --> 14:31.760
that combination of narcissism and also a kind of religiosity, intolerance, and yes,

14:32.320 --> 14:36.400
exactly what you say, a desire to destroy. You know, that if we can't get our way,

14:36.400 --> 14:41.360
we'll just destroy everything. Okay, so let's talk about that. I want to use that as a segue,

14:41.360 --> 14:46.000
and I haven't tortured you about having a PhD in Renaissance poetry. We'll get back to that.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.320
I want us to use that as a segue into the religious issue because you wrote a book here recently.

14:51.280 --> 14:55.280
Just make sure I get title exactly right. The New Puritans, How the Religion of Social

14:55.280 --> 15:02.080
Justice Captured the Western World. And so we could talk about religious issues. I've been thinking

15:02.080 --> 15:09.920
recently along the religious lines, let's say, that what we're seeing is just the modern manifestation

15:09.920 --> 15:16.080
of an eternal battle. And that battle is laid out first, very early in the biblical corpus,

15:16.080 --> 15:23.520
in the story of Cain and Abel. Because what you have in that story is two modes of adaptation,

15:23.520 --> 15:29.440
which I think roughly parallel a kind of demented narcissistic authoritarianism and a kind of

15:30.240 --> 15:35.600
responsibility laden individualism. We can discuss that. But what happens is,

15:35.600 --> 15:41.680
Cain and Abel make sacrifices, right? And that's what people do when they work, because work is the

15:41.680 --> 15:48.800
sacrifice of the present to the future. And human beings uniquely work. I mean, maybe beavers work

15:48.800 --> 15:54.960
in bees, but look, essentially human beings uniquely work. We're willing to sacrifice the

15:54.960 --> 16:01.600
present for the future. Now, what happens in the story of Cain and Abel is that Cain appears to make

16:01.600 --> 16:10.480
bloodless and relatively low quality sacrifices, whereas Abel's all in. And the consequence of

16:10.480 --> 16:16.080
that is Abel gets rewarded by God and everyone loves him and things go well for him. And Cain,

16:16.880 --> 16:23.120
nothing goes his way. And then instead of noticing that maybe he has something to do with that,

16:23.120 --> 16:30.000
he calls God out for creating an improper cosmos and really puts him on the stand. And God says,

16:31.120 --> 16:35.600
look, buddy, if you got your act together, things would go well for you. And the fact that they're

16:35.600 --> 16:41.920
not might have more to do with you than me. And Cain thinks, to hell with you, God, I think I'll

16:41.920 --> 16:47.840
go kill your favorite. And so that's the story. And that's one hell of a brutal story. And then,

16:48.160 --> 16:53.600
Cain's descendants, including Tubal Cain, which is about four generations down the line,

16:54.160 --> 16:59.520
they're the builders of the Tower of Babel and also the first people who make implements of war.

16:59.520 --> 17:03.360
So there's an idea there that there's a resentful and bitter,

17:04.400 --> 17:11.600
revengeful spirit that preoccupies mankind and that it can spread out from the individual and

17:11.600 --> 17:17.680
take out the entire polity. And I can't help but see a reflection of that on the intellectual

17:17.680 --> 17:22.560
landscape now in the political domain. Now, I'm curious about what you think about such things,

17:22.560 --> 17:28.800
because you have described this new movement, let's say, as religious. So what do you mean by

17:28.800 --> 17:34.560
that? What do you think about these more metaphysical speculations? I suppose I should be very clear

17:34.560 --> 17:39.680
about that. And in the book, I do make it clear. I've called the book The New Puritans, and I refer

17:39.680 --> 17:43.760
to the religion of social justice, because one of the things I'm very keen to do, and one of the

17:43.760 --> 17:49.440
reasons why I feel that the critical social justice activists are winning is because a lot of people

17:49.440 --> 17:54.400
do not understand their aims, they don't understand what they're about, and that they are effectively

17:54.400 --> 17:59.280
fall for the linguistic tricks. I mean, you all know that the culture war is largely about who

17:59.280 --> 18:05.120
gets to define the meaning of words. Activists often use words, but they mean the opposite.

18:05.120 --> 18:09.280
They call themselves progressive, for instance, but I believe that they are regressive.

18:09.360 --> 18:13.600
They call themselves liberal, but they are deeply illiberal. They're in favor of censorship and

18:13.600 --> 18:20.320
authoritarianism. They scream about fascism while they themselves are using fascistic tactics,

18:20.320 --> 18:24.880
such as violence to silence political opponents. So the language, unless you understand

18:24.880 --> 18:29.680
where they're coming from, and unless you understand that theirs is a belief system,

18:30.960 --> 18:37.520
which is largely tied to unfalsifiable claims, which depends upon a kind of coterie of high

18:37.520 --> 18:43.440
priests, edicts from above, telling the masses what they should believe and punishing those who

18:43.440 --> 18:49.360
descend. It has all the hallmarks of fundamentalist religion, at least, the idea of excommunicating

18:49.360 --> 18:54.960
heretics, sort of sniffing out heretics, searching for them, and doing the metaphorical

18:54.960 --> 18:58.080
equivalent of burning them at the stake, which is what we call council culture,

18:58.080 --> 19:03.120
destroying their livelihoods, destroying their reputations, a kind of merciless, brutal,

19:03.200 --> 19:09.680
cruel and vicious quality, which nonetheless dons the guise of compassion and righteousness.

19:10.640 --> 19:17.760
You know, I'm sure that bullies and innately cruel sociopaths throughout history have probably

19:17.760 --> 19:22.320
been attracted to the priesthood, because it gives them the opportunity to have a being,

19:22.320 --> 19:28.480
a figure of authority to enact cruelty, and at the same time, to be validated as a principal

19:28.560 --> 19:32.880
and important member of society. So I think it does mean like Pharisees and scribes,

19:32.880 --> 19:36.560
those sorts of people. Exactly. I'm not suggesting for a second, you know,

19:36.560 --> 19:41.040
if you take something as brutal as the Inquisition, I mean, I'm sure a lot of those people involved

19:41.040 --> 19:44.000
felt that they were doing God's work and genuinely thought they were on the side of the angels,

19:44.000 --> 19:49.760
but you can be damn sure that there were some psychopaths who were attracted to those positions

19:49.760 --> 19:54.800
of power. So when I'm saying that I talk about the religion of critical social justice, I'm doing so

19:54.880 --> 20:00.240
to try and make it accessible. I've found that if you just, because it is so baffling to everyone,

20:00.240 --> 20:05.280
most people are completely baffled because for a start, they have their own kind of esoteric

20:05.280 --> 20:11.360
language, this terminology like heteronormativity and toxic masculinity and cisgender, etc. Words

20:11.360 --> 20:16.320
that most people just don't even know what they mean. But if you see them as kind of a biblical

20:16.320 --> 20:21.520
script or a religious text, and they do have their foundational holy texts such as Foucault

20:21.520 --> 20:26.880
and Judith Butler and things like that, if you make this analogy to religion, I think it makes

20:26.880 --> 20:32.480
the movement comprehensible. And I think in order to defeat it, it has to be comprehended.

20:32.480 --> 20:38.560
And I think most people can't comprehend it. So let's try to get at something that might

20:38.560 --> 20:42.800
approximate a definition of religion. So this is how I've been thinking about it technically.

20:43.760 --> 20:48.880
So imagine that you see the world through a hierarchy of presuppositions,

20:49.840 --> 20:54.000
which you have to because you're fundamentally ignorant. You have to presuppose things in order

20:54.000 --> 20:57.760
to move forward because you don't have infinite knowledge. So you have to look at the world

20:57.760 --> 21:03.120
through a hierarchy of presuppositions. Then you can imagine that some presuppositions are deeper

21:03.120 --> 21:10.000
than others. And what that would mean is some presuppositions very little, very few other

21:10.000 --> 21:16.560
presuppositions depend on, and some presuppositions many other presuppositions depend on.

21:17.520 --> 21:22.560
Right? Sort of like it's like citation depth in the scientific literature. And so freedom of

21:22.560 --> 21:27.760
speech, for example, would be a presupposition in a liberal polity upon which almost all other

21:27.760 --> 21:35.200
presuppositions rest. So if you move it, you're moving the depths. So a religion specifies the

21:35.200 --> 21:40.880
deepest presuppositions and they have to be axiomatic because that's sort of where your ignorance

21:40.880 --> 21:45.280
bottoms out. You have to say, I hold these things to be self-evident before you can proceed.

21:45.680 --> 21:50.720
And that is something like the existence of a deity as a presupposition that has to underpin.

21:50.720 --> 21:58.400
Right. Okay. So that's the next issue. So Carl, I read a lot of Carl Jung years ago and very deeply.

21:58.400 --> 22:05.040
And one of the things Jung said about Protestantism, which I found remarkable, he criticized both

22:05.040 --> 22:11.120
Catholicism and Protestantism as a friendly critic, I would say, pointing out that the

22:11.200 --> 22:18.640
the temptation that Catholicism might fall prey to is one of centralizing authoritarianism.

22:19.200 --> 22:26.960
And the temptation that Protestantism falls prey to is fractionating individualism. He said,

22:26.960 --> 22:32.160
the logical conclusion of the Protestant revolution is that every single person becomes their own

22:32.160 --> 22:38.080
church. And so it looks to me like that's happened and what's happened. And psychologists have

22:38.080 --> 22:43.360
abetted this. And even the great clinicians, I believe, have abetted this regardless of my

22:43.360 --> 22:51.040
admiration for them by substituting the self for God. And I think what you have, especially on the

22:51.760 --> 22:58.400
psychopathic narcissistic fringes of what used to be the left, and you see this on the right as well,

22:58.400 --> 23:03.520
is the momentary self elevated to the status of God.

23:04.160 --> 23:08.480
Well, you see that an awful lot, which I think is why, I mean, you've identified the narcissism

23:08.480 --> 23:14.320
within these kind of movements, but also the rapidity with which they resort to religious

23:14.320 --> 23:20.320
terminology or religious ideas or religious modes of expression, for instance. You remember when

23:20.320 --> 23:25.840
them, was it outside of Netflix when they were protesting against Dave Chappelle's show? And

23:25.840 --> 23:31.360
there was that comedian protesting with a sign that said, we like Dave or we like jokes. I think

23:31.360 --> 23:37.200
they had signs like that. And a one woman cornered him and it was all caught on film. And she screamed

23:37.200 --> 23:43.600
repeatedly in his face, repent, mother, she said it again and again and again. And I mentioned that

23:43.600 --> 23:48.720
in the book, because I love that that sort of combined that combination of rage and religiosity,

23:48.720 --> 23:53.840
I think really encapsulates what the movement is all about. I think in terms of the presuppositions

23:53.840 --> 23:58.960
of that movement, which it takes as axiomatic, it's not supernatural. Okay, it doesn't talk about

23:58.960 --> 24:05.840
a deity, even though it has its profits, I think, from the French post-structuralist of the 1960s.

24:05.840 --> 24:09.920
But I think it does have certain axiomatic presuppositions such as

24:10.640 --> 24:16.080
there are power structures that dominate society, that underpinned all human interaction. And these

24:16.080 --> 24:21.440
are based on the notion of group identity. And that that is how society needs to be understood.

24:21.440 --> 24:26.880
As Foucault talked about grids of power through society, power not being a top down phenomenon,

24:26.880 --> 24:33.680
something that sort of is latent within all of our interactions and behavior.

24:34.400 --> 24:39.680
And they see that they believe that these activists believe that they can pick this

24:39.680 --> 24:44.480
apart and understand it and remedy the wrongs in society, so long as they can identify where

24:44.480 --> 24:52.080
the power structures lie and who is exercising privilege at the expense of the oppressed. That's

24:52.080 --> 24:58.480
why critical race theorists, I mean, it was put like this in James Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose's

24:58.480 --> 25:04.080
book, that the key question that you ask if you are a critical race theory is not a theorist, is not

25:05.280 --> 25:09.840
did racism take place in this situation, but how did racism manifest in this situation?

25:09.840 --> 25:10.560
Yes, right, right.

25:10.560 --> 25:15.600
So it's almost like a ghostly spiritual thing that is always there. I think that's one of their

25:15.600 --> 25:17.120
that's one of their major presuppositions.

25:17.760 --> 25:22.560
Well, then, well, so here's another way of thinking about that from the religious perspective.

25:22.560 --> 25:30.400
I mean, Milton Satan is an authoritarian narcissist and he rules over hell. And so

25:30.400 --> 25:36.320
he's a figure that's very much analogous to Mao or to Stalin, right? He's someone who climbs

25:36.320 --> 25:42.080
the most pathological possible power hierarchy and then regards himself as a victor even though

25:42.080 --> 25:49.920
he's actually the biggest loser. And so, so Satan is the spirit, you might say in the Judeo-Christian

25:49.920 --> 25:58.720
tradition, who rules the world by force. Now, the postmodern neo-Marxist types believe that there's

25:58.720 --> 26:05.040
nothing but power. So I can't see that that's any different than a certain Christian heresy that

26:05.040 --> 26:10.320
rose up in the Middle Ages, making the claim that Satan himself was the ruler of the earth,

26:10.320 --> 26:16.560
right? Because the notion there is that power itself is the only or at least the ultimate

26:17.360 --> 26:22.000
motivator and, well motivator is the right way of thinking about it. And so, and then

26:22.880 --> 26:27.120
it follows a lot of things follow from that, right? One thing that follows from that is that

26:27.120 --> 26:31.840
there's no such thing as free speech because there's just conflicts between different claims to power.

26:31.840 --> 26:37.680
And that if you promote free speech, that's just an indication of how conniving you are

26:37.680 --> 26:42.240
to use that entire philosophical language to do nothing but buttress your own colonialist

26:42.240 --> 26:47.040
power claims. Yes, because their theories always put you in that position where you can't win.

26:47.040 --> 26:51.040
You know, it's similar with with the critical race theory, they have their notion of interest

26:51.040 --> 26:56.880
convergence. You know, when people say, well, there are extremely successful black individuals in

26:56.880 --> 27:00.960
our history, Barack Obama, say, someone like that, they will say the only reason that those

27:00.960 --> 27:06.400
people have succeeded is because it was in the interests of white people for them to succeed.

27:06.400 --> 27:11.280
In other words, if black people don't succeed, right, so if black people don't succeed in society,

27:11.280 --> 27:15.040
that's evidence of critical race theorists' claims. But if they do succeed, it's also

27:15.040 --> 27:18.400
evidence of their claims because that's interest convergence. So they keep putting you in this

27:18.400 --> 27:26.240
kind of situation. That to me has to be religion without, as in religious belief, that has not

27:26.240 --> 27:32.480
been, it has merely been asserted rather than proven. The fact that they take on the very

27:32.480 --> 27:36.720
notion of rationality, enlightenment ideas, the fact that they think that those things are even

27:36.720 --> 27:40.560
part, and they also see that through group identity, that that is just the product of

27:40.560 --> 27:46.240
some dead white men in periwigs. President Trump recently issued a warning from his Mar-a-Lago

27:46.240 --> 27:51.040
home, quote, our currency is crashing and will soon no longer be the world standard,

27:51.040 --> 27:55.920
which will be our greatest defeat, frankly, in 200 years. There are three reasons why the

27:55.920 --> 28:02.240
central banks are dumping the US dollar, inflation, deficit spending, and our insurmountable national

28:02.240 --> 28:08.000
debt. The fact is, there is one asset that has withstood famine, wars, and political and economic

28:08.000 --> 28:13.840
upheaval dating back to biblical times, gold. And you can own it in a tax-sheltered retirement

28:13.840 --> 28:18.320
account with the help of Birch Gold. That's right, Birch Gold will help you convert an

28:18.320 --> 28:25.200
existing IRA or 401K, maybe from a previous employer, into an IRA in gold. When currencies fail,

28:25.200 --> 28:31.440
gold is a safe haven. How much more time does the dollar have? Protect your savings with gold.

28:31.440 --> 28:36.160
Birch Gold has an A-plus rating with the Better Business Bureau and thousands of happy customers.

28:36.160 --> 28:44.320
Text Jordan to 989898 and get your free info kit on gold. Again, text Jordan to 989898.

28:47.440 --> 28:53.520
So how do you understand this? There seems to be, okay, so we figure we've got a couple of,

28:53.520 --> 28:58.240
what would you say, contenders for deity. One would be Satan himself, right, the spirit of

28:58.240 --> 29:02.800
power. The other would be the untrammeled hedonic self. It's something like that. But then there's

29:02.800 --> 29:10.960
a weird paradox there, not that the paradox bothers the postmodern types, that group identity is

29:10.960 --> 29:20.560
paramount, but full, what would you say, full licentiousness on the personal front and the

29:20.560 --> 29:27.760
granting of every whim on the personal front is also requisite. And I don't, I can't quite square

29:27.760 --> 29:34.560
that coherently. Like, how is it that the radicals can push forward the notion that group identity is

29:34.560 --> 29:40.880
the only identity, but also push forward the notion that everything possible is to be permitted every

29:40.880 --> 29:46.400
individual at every moment. But you put your finger on it when you said that the paradoxes don't

29:47.280 --> 29:52.400
trouble the postmodernists. You know, it's sort of built into their whole idea. When Derrida was

29:52.400 --> 29:58.400
writing, he was trying to write incoherently. You know, it's part of it. He did manage. It's

29:58.400 --> 30:07.200
absolutely unreadable. So let me try and understand what you're saying here. You were talking about

30:07.200 --> 30:12.400
the idea that- Well, we see this worship of the self that emerged. So there's contenders for God,

30:12.400 --> 30:19.440
right? We have power and we have the self. And then there's an element of that that spreads out

30:19.440 --> 30:25.520
into identity. Now that the radical types definitely put forward group identity as paramount,

30:25.520 --> 30:29.680
and yet they worship the self. What do you mean by licentiousness? What do you mean by

30:30.240 --> 30:34.080
do they believe that absolutely everything is permissible, that any kind of individual

30:35.440 --> 30:39.200
desire is able to be fulfilled? Because in their world, I think they're quite

30:39.200 --> 30:43.040
prescriptive, aren't they, about which modes of behavior are acceptable and which aren't?

30:43.040 --> 30:48.960
Well, that gets extraordinarily complex because it looks to me, one of the things I see on campuses

30:48.960 --> 30:55.680
for example, is the insistence on the left progressive front, let's say, that any form

30:55.680 --> 31:00.880
of sexual identity or behavior whatsoever is permissible. And not only permissible,

31:00.880 --> 31:08.000
but to be celebrated. But now it's complicated because at the same time, every single interaction

31:08.000 --> 31:14.000
between a young man and a young woman is so absolutely dangerous that it has to be subjected

31:14.000 --> 31:21.040
to contractual validation before it can proceed. Well, yeah, well, it's a weird psychoanalytic

31:21.040 --> 31:26.480
truism, that if you go too far in one direction, you simultaneously go too far in the other.

31:26.480 --> 31:31.440
And that really muddies up the water. So the really narcissistic types, for example,

31:31.440 --> 31:37.440
have an extremely uncertain core. But that doesn't make them any less, what would you say,

31:37.440 --> 31:42.320
forthright in their claims that they should rule. So you can't stretch your, go ahead.

31:42.800 --> 31:49.520
Well, I don't, I'm not so sure that it's about fulfilling any indulgence, no matter how depraved.

31:50.560 --> 31:54.160
I think it's more about what they call queering society. I think it's more about,

31:54.160 --> 32:02.080
if it is in the service of demolishing the cis, white, hetero-patriarchal structures

32:02.080 --> 32:06.000
that are in place, then that is seen as a benefit as something positive.

32:06.000 --> 32:10.400
Right. So you think that licentiousness serves the purposes of demolition?

32:10.400 --> 32:11.040
I do.

32:11.040 --> 32:15.360
What about the reverse hypothesis is that, because I would say this might be more

32:15.360 --> 32:22.320
true of Foucault, all the demolition was put forward to license the licentiousness.

32:23.120 --> 32:24.800
I don't know. I mean, this is real.

32:25.440 --> 32:28.560
Yeah, I'm not sure about that. I mean, a lot of people will say that because Foucault has,

32:28.560 --> 32:30.640
as you know, a very shady past.

32:31.520 --> 32:32.720
Yeah, you might say that.

32:32.720 --> 32:37.360
Yeah, absolutely. And people have pointed out that there seems to be a strong correlation

32:37.360 --> 32:43.680
between some of the founding postmodernists and, shall we say, well, yeah, depraved sexual

32:43.680 --> 32:48.080
activity, sometimes pedophilia, these kinds of things. The question, I suppose,

32:48.080 --> 32:53.280
are you suggesting that they created this kind of theoretical framework in order to justify

32:54.640 --> 32:56.320
that sort of behavior? Is that what you mean?

32:56.320 --> 33:03.760
Well, you see, I waver and maybe the causality is interactive because you could see,

33:03.760 --> 33:10.080
I see a lot of stunningly immature behavior on the radical front from a developmental

33:10.080 --> 33:15.440
psychological perspective. So, for example, a lot of the behavior I see looks to me like

33:15.440 --> 33:21.440
unsocialized two-year-old behavior, because two-year-olds are highly prone to motivational

33:21.440 --> 33:26.960
and emotional whims in the short term, and they're incapable of developing a shared frame of

33:26.960 --> 33:32.640
reference. That doesn't happen till kids are three. And aggressive two-year-olds who don't

33:32.640 --> 33:37.840
develop that by four never develop it in their entire life because they become alienated and

33:37.840 --> 33:44.560
they don't make friends and they can't further their development. And so you could say, if this is

33:44.560 --> 33:50.640
sort of a Freudian id-like view, that part of what we're seeing is the expression of extremely

33:50.640 --> 33:58.000
unsocialized, immature, motivational and emotional demands fragmented with a, what would you say,

33:58.000 --> 34:04.800
temper tantrum-like insistence, constant insistence that those whims be granted

34:05.680 --> 34:11.520
immediately. And then you could say, well, the entire power critique has been erected by,

34:11.520 --> 34:16.960
on the intellectual front, just to justify that. Although you could also reverse it and say, no,

34:16.960 --> 34:21.680
the licentiousness, which was the case you were making, the licentiousness is promoted because

34:21.760 --> 34:27.680
it's revolutionary in a sense, and it can be used to demolish these so-called traditional power

34:27.680 --> 34:32.240
structures. Well, it has to be because they just have so many impositions on other people's freedoms.

34:32.240 --> 34:35.760
They have so many ideas of what is acceptable and what is not acceptable, particularly in the arts,

34:36.480 --> 34:42.560
in film, in plays, in books, that, you know, they're for censorship. They believe that things that are,

34:42.560 --> 34:46.400
that horrible word, they use problematic and they like to problematize things.

34:46.400 --> 34:50.640
So it can't be the case that they just believe in a kind of global free-for-all.

34:50.640 --> 34:56.160
It can't be that because I think they come across more like Pharisees to me than anything else.

34:56.160 --> 34:59.840
But maybe what you're describing in terms of the temper tantrums and the things that we see

35:00.800 --> 35:05.760
from these people is that that is just simply the natural consequence of when you have decades

35:05.760 --> 35:10.480
of academics and figures of authority saying that we ought to prioritize our emotional responses

35:10.480 --> 35:16.320
and our own subjective view of the world over objective epistemological frameworks.

35:17.280 --> 35:21.920
Or actual practical responsibility. I mean, I saw this at the University of Toronto. It was

35:21.920 --> 35:27.920
one of the things that constantly made me morally ill was that my idiot compatriots thought that the

35:27.920 --> 35:32.240
best thing to do with young people was to teach them to protest rather than to help them figure

35:32.240 --> 35:37.120
out how to make their way responsibly and productively and generously in the world.

35:37.920 --> 35:43.200
They've created a generation that are infantile. I mean, it is an infantilized world and we see it

35:43.200 --> 35:48.160
in absolutely every strand of our culture and politics as well. And it's because, as you say,

35:49.120 --> 35:56.400
academics, by and large, are activists first and academics second. Helen Pluckrose traces

35:56.400 --> 36:01.680
that to what she calls the applied turn of postmodernism, late 80s. Postmodernists for many

36:01.680 --> 36:07.040
years were quite enjoyed theorizing and frolicking about coming up with these airy fairy ideas,

36:07.040 --> 36:12.320
not applying them to society, not seriously saying we should reconstruct society and apply

36:12.320 --> 36:19.520
these methods. And then the applied postmodernist said, actually, we can actually change society,

36:19.520 --> 36:25.280
revolutionize society through the application of our untested theories and highly contested theories.

36:25.280 --> 36:33.280
And they did it. And what's so tragic is that it eventually worked. We're now in a situation where

36:33.840 --> 36:37.760
our government over here, the government certainly in Canada and in the US,

36:37.840 --> 36:44.400
they are implementing these ideas, these highly contested theories in public policy,

36:44.400 --> 36:49.600
in the educational sense. Yes, they're making the mandatory. Well, that was what propelled me

36:49.600 --> 36:53.840
into the public domain to begin with, was the first move of that sort on the Trudeau Liberal

36:53.840 --> 37:00.480
Government Front, right, mandated speech. But that's why surely it does merit the analogy with

37:00.480 --> 37:10.800
religion, because you are imposing on society ideas that are based on belief, simply based on

37:10.800 --> 37:17.600
belief. You know, there is no evidence that reorganizing society in the way that the critical

37:17.600 --> 37:23.600
race theories would like to do, so that we have a hyper racialized society that focuses first and

37:23.600 --> 37:28.240
foremost on your group of identity and secondarily on who you are as an individual. There's no

37:28.320 --> 37:35.200
evidence that this is making society less racist. So we seem to have agreed that

37:36.400 --> 37:45.360
the desire for demolition and destruction rules paramount even over the desire for untrammeled

37:45.360 --> 37:54.480
personal self-expression. I think that is inevitable when you come from the supposition

37:54.480 --> 38:00.400
that society is inherently broken, that it is undergirded by power structures that only

38:00.400 --> 38:07.520
support the already privileged. Okay, so let's dive into that, because this is a good place to

38:07.520 --> 38:12.960
further interrogate the left issues. So, you know, a lot of the people that I talk with,

38:12.960 --> 38:18.480
Russell Brown and Joe Rogan, Brett Weinstein, those are good, Eric Weinstein, those are good

38:18.480 --> 38:28.640
initial exemplars, are more classical leftist types, and yet they're identified by the screaming

38:28.640 --> 38:33.840
radicals as gateways to the old right, which is extraordinarily interesting, because it means as

38:33.840 --> 38:39.920
soon as you're no longer a useful idiot from the radical perspective, you're instantly a Nazi,

38:39.920 --> 38:51.360
which is very convenient for them. But here's the thing. The postmodern critique that society

38:51.360 --> 38:59.040
is to be understood as nothing but the manifestation of power is attractive, partly because when

38:59.040 --> 39:06.640
social arrangements or even psychological arrangements pathologize, they do pathologize in

39:06.640 --> 39:14.000
the direction of power, right? So, if you're, you can tyrannize yourself like an overlord,

39:14.000 --> 39:20.080
you can tyrannize your partner, you can tyrannize your family and your community,

39:20.080 --> 39:25.280
you can act like a tyrant on the local political stage, and then nationally, right?

39:25.280 --> 39:31.120
You can do that in business as well. And so, and that happens relatively often. So,

39:31.840 --> 39:39.840
there's a core of sense in the claim that power is a powerful motivating force. Now,

39:39.840 --> 39:46.480
I think the radicals go too far when they say everything is about power because, well, everything

39:46.480 --> 39:52.160
is a lot of things, and you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. But the problem,

39:52.160 --> 39:58.480
the problem the left therefore has, if the left is willing to be reasonable and say, well, some

39:59.280 --> 40:04.400
social structures are corrupted by power, then the left has to figure out, and can't,

40:04.400 --> 40:11.680
because I've asked like 50 senators and Republican and congressmen on the Democrat side to do this.

40:12.560 --> 40:19.760
If your leftist stance is that power corrupts society, then how in the world can you tell

40:19.760 --> 40:25.840
when those who make that claim take that claim too far? And I've asked, like the reason I brought

40:25.840 --> 40:31.840
up the Democrat, the senators and congressmen is because I asked every lefty I could get my hands

40:31.840 --> 40:37.920
on, and that's been quite a few over the last five years, when the left goes too far. And I even

40:37.920 --> 40:42.480
asked Robert Kennedy that recently, and he said, well, I'm trying to run a campaign based on unity,

40:42.480 --> 40:47.520
and so I don't want to go down that rabbit hole. It's like, well, the barbarians are at your gate,

40:47.520 --> 40:53.280
buddy. They've been canceling you for 18 years. So, how do we separate out this?

40:53.280 --> 40:56.240
Well, there are so many things that you've raised there. I mean, firstly,

40:56.240 --> 41:00.480
you're right to identify that there is a kernel in truth of truth in the postmodernist claims,

41:00.480 --> 41:06.080
that power is important. It is significant in human behavior and society and history. All of that,

41:06.080 --> 41:10.800
that is absolutely accurate. And you're also right that where they go wrong is to assume that

41:10.800 --> 41:14.640
everything is about power. Like you say, power is really important, but it's not everything.

41:15.280 --> 41:21.520
And I wonder whether reducing everything to just power structures makes things

41:22.480 --> 41:28.240
understandable, easier in a way. Yeah, well, we found the best predictor. In our first study,

41:28.240 --> 41:32.960
the best predictor of left-wing authoritarianism was low verbal intelligence.

41:32.960 --> 41:39.280
Right, because people want easy answers. Absolutely. Power is a good easy answer,

41:39.280 --> 41:46.080
right? Any ideology is because it means that you're outsourcing your thinking to a set of rules,

41:46.080 --> 41:51.040
and that is what is happening. But that's why all those people that you've tried to ask this

41:51.040 --> 41:56.000
question, what happens when the left goes too far in terms of their own megalomania?

41:56.000 --> 41:59.520
They won't answer the question because to do so would be to acknowledge that there is a flaw

41:59.520 --> 42:02.880
in their ideology. There's a potential flaw in their system, that they're dealing ultimately

42:02.880 --> 42:09.600
with human beings. It's the same reason why the Stalinists have never forgiven Orwell.

42:09.600 --> 42:13.680
All these people on the left have always hated him for pointing out that the left is just as

42:13.680 --> 42:16.880
susceptible to corruption as the right is, and they've never forgiven him for that.

42:16.880 --> 42:20.880
And it comes down to that idea of moral purity. I mean, one of the reasons I call them the

42:20.880 --> 42:25.600
new Puritans. Again, it's an analogy. It's trying to make them accessible. It's because in their

42:25.600 --> 42:30.640
world, to deviate even slightly from this very simplistic formula that they've applied to society,

42:30.640 --> 42:37.760
to give them power, ironically enough, to put them in a position where they can control other people,

42:37.760 --> 42:42.880
but also can control their own understandings and comprehensions of the world, because they've

42:42.880 --> 42:47.680
got this framework through which they can look at it. And to say, well, actually, your framework

42:47.680 --> 42:51.360
is flawed in all sorts of ways, that's harder because then you have to start thinking. And they

42:51.360 --> 42:57.600
don't want to start thinking. Thinking is the death of ideology. I think that's why you're

42:57.600 --> 43:00.960
getting that moral purity, but it's also why. I mean, you mentioned, interestingly,

43:01.520 --> 43:06.880
people like Joe Rogan and Russell Brown being considered a gateway to the alt-right. They're

43:06.880 --> 43:12.960
still traditionally politically more akin to the left, I would say, than the right.

43:12.960 --> 43:17.280
But because they've deviated slightly, you have this kind of puritanical sledgehammer

43:17.280 --> 43:24.240
coming down and saying, no, you're straying from what our ideology says you should believe.

43:24.240 --> 43:31.200
And that, to me, also feels like a fundamentalist religion. And I'm making the distinction clearly

43:31.200 --> 43:34.880
between a religion and a fundamentalist religion, because I think even within Catholicism,

43:34.880 --> 43:38.800
the Vatican has always encouraged debate, theological debate and discussion. It's not as

43:38.800 --> 43:44.240
though they just give you the catechism and say, that's it. There's all these kinds of discussions

43:44.240 --> 43:48.880
and debates and nuances being teased out in theological thoughts. Theologians for centuries

43:48.880 --> 43:54.000
have done that. But with fundamentalist religion, that doesn't happen. It doesn't happen with ISIS,

43:54.000 --> 43:58.400
for instance. You don't get the sort of leaders of ISIS sitting around cross-legged in their caves

43:58.400 --> 44:02.480
saying, well, let's decide whether we're right about this fine theological point.

44:02.480 --> 44:07.120
That doesn't happen. So what scares me, I think, about the critical social justice movement,

44:07.120 --> 44:12.160
is that they are like a fundamentalist religion for some reason. I mean, this is why, and you know

44:12.160 --> 44:16.320
this, whenever you meet one of these people, whenever you encounter them online, get into

44:16.320 --> 44:19.440
some kind of discussion, you know what their opinions are and absolutely everything.

44:19.440 --> 44:22.800
Yes, yes, yes. Like turning a crank on someone's head.

44:23.360 --> 44:28.560
I've never been surprised by them. I'd like to be surprised once in a while. I've had a few

44:28.560 --> 44:32.320
occasions recently where I've gotten to conversa... You know, I fall for it. You should just block

44:32.320 --> 44:35.520
them, really, because they're not people who can be reasoned with. But every now and then,

44:35.520 --> 44:40.480
I take the bait and I say, okay, what is it you think I've said? What is upset you? What is the

44:40.560 --> 44:45.680
perspective that I have that you disagree with and why? And they can't do it. They just come back

44:45.680 --> 44:48.800
screaming Nazi or whatever, and then you think, okay, well, I shouldn't have bothered trying.

44:48.800 --> 44:54.560
But they never surprised me. I just wish they would, because if you're not thinking for yourself

44:54.560 --> 44:58.880
and challenging your own ideas, if you're not coming from the basis, from humility, if you're

44:58.880 --> 45:04.720
not coming to the world on the understanding that you're probably wrong about an awful lot of things,

45:04.720 --> 45:09.280
I don't think you're fully human in a way. I think you're like an automaton. You know, you're just,

45:10.240 --> 45:14.640
you're just following a code, a script. You're possessed by a principality.

45:15.200 --> 45:22.160
Right. I find that disturbing. Okay, so let me hassle you about something else. I tweeted out

45:22.160 --> 45:30.000
at Richard Dawkins here recently, and I talked to Richard Dawkins, and I actually admire Richard

45:30.000 --> 45:35.760
Dawkins. I liked his books. They taught me a lot in some of his essays, too. And I think Dawkins

45:36.320 --> 45:41.760
is a real scientist in that he believes there is truth and that the pursuit of the truth will set

45:41.760 --> 45:47.920
you free, which by the way is a religious claim, but he still believes that. In any case, I also

45:47.920 --> 45:54.960
think that Dawkins and Harris and the rest of the new atheists help pave the landscape for this new

45:54.960 --> 46:00.480
woke catastrophe, because it's a humanistic movement fundamentally, and it's radically

46:00.480 --> 46:04.800
anti-science. And I think that Dawkins, well, I know Dawkins sees that because I've been watching

46:04.800 --> 46:09.760
his tweets, and I didn't talk to him. And it's certainly the case that the woke mob, I think,

46:09.760 --> 46:16.320
can take out science even more easily than they can take out the vestiges of Judeo-Christian thought,

46:16.320 --> 46:22.880
and they're definitely going to do that. So now Dawkins and his coterie looked at

46:23.440 --> 46:28.320
the history of the West, and they said, well, we should dispense with that medieval superstition,

46:28.320 --> 46:32.320
and we should progress down the Enlightenment trail. And I've talked to Douglas Murray about this.

46:32.880 --> 46:38.640
Now, the problem with that, it seems to me, so Jung said something very interesting as well

46:39.360 --> 46:47.200
that I'll bring up. He implied that Catholicism, with all its strange mysticism and dream-like

46:49.360 --> 46:55.760
propositional structure, was as sane as people got, like that in order for people to

46:56.560 --> 47:01.920
function psychologically and to exist together socially, the belief system that united them

47:01.920 --> 47:08.960
had to have a dream-like quality. Okay, so and that now the new atheist types would say, well,

47:08.960 --> 47:15.920
no, no, no, we can replace all that mumbo jumbo and darkness and occult mysticism with a clear-headed

47:15.920 --> 47:20.800
rationality. But what I see happening instead, and this is on the religious front, is that

47:21.600 --> 47:27.280
in the aftermath of the death of God, what we've seen reemerge is either a form of worship of power

47:27.280 --> 47:33.920
or degeneration into a kind of polytheistic paganism, not a move forward to Enlightenment-type

47:33.920 --> 47:41.120
Dawkins rationality. Quite the contrary. And so one of the things I'm curious, I know Murray is

47:41.120 --> 47:47.920
uncomfortable about this. Douglas Murray is uncomfortable about this. If the woke movement

47:47.920 --> 47:54.480
is a religion, and if it's a dangerous religion, is the alternative to that no religion, or is

47:54.480 --> 47:59.600
the alternative to that whatever might constitute genuine religion? And what do you think about

47:59.600 --> 48:05.680
that? Well, I think there is clearly something within humanity that we require a certain

48:05.680 --> 48:11.120
satisfaction from some kind of belief system, which is outside of ourselves or a sense that

48:11.120 --> 48:14.960
there is something beyond ourselves. I suppose you might call it transcendence. I think there is

48:14.960 --> 48:22.240
a need for that. I think that I get that through the arts. I think that's why we create things.

48:22.240 --> 48:28.480
That's why we are creative beings, which is also why I think the woke movement is threatened by the

48:28.480 --> 48:35.040
arts and seeks to curtail it and actually to transform it into just another propagandising tool,

48:36.320 --> 48:41.520
because it fundamentally doesn't understand what art is. So it is interesting to me though

48:41.520 --> 48:44.400
to have noted that the new atheist movement, the one that you describe,

48:44.960 --> 48:50.560
they seem now to have evolved into the most woke of all, the humanist society.

48:51.280 --> 48:57.120
Yeah, there's something about them that they bought into gender identity ideology very quickly,

48:57.120 --> 49:02.960
probably before other bodies did. And the humanist society in the UK now is fully paid up in that

49:03.520 --> 49:09.840
really quasi-religious belief system, the idea of a sexed or gendered soul that doesn't match your

49:09.840 --> 49:16.320
biological form. How is that anything other than religious? How is it anything other than

49:16.320 --> 49:22.160
supernatural, really? But it has been interesting to me that those were the very people,

49:22.800 --> 49:28.320
the people who were talking about rationality and to sort of claw back the primacy of enlightenment

49:28.320 --> 49:32.000
values, that they are the ones who've been most susceptible of all. Of course, this is what has

49:32.000 --> 49:40.080
got Dawkins in trouble. That's a stunningly devastating observation, because if it turns out

49:40.080 --> 49:46.240
that those who wanted to walk down the mass enlightenment pathway, produce children who

49:46.240 --> 49:52.960
were most susceptible to woke ideology, that's a pretty damning bit of evidence for the validity

49:52.960 --> 49:59.840
of that approach. As far as I mean, I'm trying to look at it. Well, because it's always concerned

49:59.840 --> 50:04.640
me that some of my most intelligent friends and acquaintances have fallen for the woke

50:04.640 --> 50:09.760
movement. In other words, you talk about the fact that a lot of the activists are very

50:09.760 --> 50:14.880
infantile in their behavior, and yet some of the smartest people in society seem to buy into it.

50:14.880 --> 50:22.240
It has the capacity to infect everyone, perhaps because it isn't responsive to intellectual

50:22.240 --> 50:29.600
rigor. It exists regardless of that. Right, but then that begs the question of why it attracts

50:29.600 --> 50:34.560
the intelligent types that you're describing. I mean, look, it originated in the Bloody Academy.

50:34.560 --> 50:39.440
It didn't originate. Hypothetically, it originated not only in the academy, but

50:39.440 --> 50:42.880
in the core of the academy that was most preoccupied with the humanities.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.040
It obviously appeals to the intellect, let's say.

50:47.600 --> 50:58.400
Or is it just that we're all, we all have the capacity to fall for hysteria? Is it possible

50:58.400 --> 51:04.880
that we're just all, I mean, look, my book opens with a discussion of Salem, The Witch Hunts in

51:04.880 --> 51:10.480
Salem. And one of the key things about that, the more I read about it, and the more I was

51:10.480 --> 51:14.800
fascinated by the fact that it was these figures in authority, it was the ministers, the judges,

51:14.800 --> 51:19.040
it was the highly intelligent in the community who were the ones who were pushing this. I mean,

51:19.040 --> 51:22.720
the girls were screaming and crying witch and pointing and saying that the devil was everywhere,

51:22.720 --> 51:26.880
and they'd seen people sign the devil's book and all of that kind of thing. I see those girls as

51:26.880 --> 51:31.760
analogous with the screaming anime activists online who just shout Nazi everywhere. They see

51:31.760 --> 51:36.960
Nazis everywhere. The girls saw witches everywhere. I see that as very, very similar. But it would

51:36.960 --> 51:41.280
have gone away if the ministers and the judges said, no, this isn't rational. You're wrong.

51:42.320 --> 51:46.960
There's no evidence for your claims. We have to move on. But they didn't. They went along with it.

51:46.960 --> 51:52.320
That's why people ended up being executed. It's when figures in authority capitulate

51:52.320 --> 51:57.040
to the screaming of the children. You've described the children, the activist has children.

51:57.040 --> 52:01.440
The activists themselves, I would posit, are not the problem. If they were all out there with

52:01.440 --> 52:07.120
their billboards screaming. It's the enablers. It's the politicians and people in charge.

52:07.920 --> 52:15.760
So one of the things you see as the biblical corpus unfolds itself symbolically is an emerging

52:15.760 --> 52:22.720
relationship between the figure of Cain. And so that's that bitter figure who's out for revenge

52:22.720 --> 52:27.920
and the figure of the, what would you call it, untrammeled intellect. So for example,

52:28.800 --> 52:32.960
very rapidly after the Cain and Abel story, you have the story of the Tower of Babel.

52:33.840 --> 52:40.480
And what you see there are emperors who are competing to replace God, right? They're building

52:40.480 --> 52:46.720
towers that are ever and ever higher predicated on the proposition that they could build a tower

52:46.720 --> 52:52.080
all the way to heaven. So that's like Jacob's ladder and thereby replace God. Then you have,

52:52.080 --> 53:00.000
you know, the Milton's meditations on Lucifer. Lucifer is the, what the highest angel of God's

53:00.000 --> 53:06.480
heavenly kingdom who's gone most wrong. And he's a stellar example of the, of the untrammeled intellect.

53:06.480 --> 53:12.000
You know, and I kind of see this in the New Atheist movement too. It's like, we're so smart

53:12.960 --> 53:18.880
that our theories can replace the transcendent. Now, your way out of that, I think you just

53:18.880 --> 53:24.960
told me, your way out of that is your involvement on the aesthetic front with the arts, right?

53:24.960 --> 53:30.640
Well, I think so. Well, there are two, there are two ways. There's also humility. I think,

53:30.640 --> 53:36.160
I come back to that point. What you're describing is hubris and that's something which is,

53:36.160 --> 53:39.760
which is common, particularly common among intelligent people, I think.

53:39.760 --> 53:44.240
Right, right. Absolutely. It's the cardinal sin of the intellect is hubris.

53:44.240 --> 53:54.880
Yes, exactly. But yes, the arts, I think are, I suppose, are way out if they are sustained

53:54.880 --> 54:01.920
because they, they satisfying that human need to, to understand ourselves and to explore

54:02.000 --> 54:08.800
ourselves and to interrogate our existence. It's so important, therefore, that the arts

54:08.800 --> 54:11.040
aren't curtailed in the way that they currently are being done.

54:11.040 --> 54:16.160
So let me ask you a question about that. I agree with that. I mean, I see that the signal power

54:16.720 --> 54:22.320
of beauty, especially manifested in music, for me, speaks of something that's truly transcendent.

54:22.320 --> 54:31.040
So here's a question for you. So is there a superordinate unity at which the arts aim?

54:31.840 --> 54:39.040
And is that unity not equivalent to the monotheistic spirit? I know this is a major question,

54:39.040 --> 54:41.040
right? I'm not, I'm throwing out a major question.

54:41.040 --> 54:41.760
It is a major question.

54:41.760 --> 54:47.200
Something makes the arts the arts, right? It's their movement towards beauty. What beauty and

54:47.200 --> 54:54.000
unity, transcendence, but are the arts unified? Are they, are they the manifestation of a unitary

54:54.000 --> 54:58.480
spirit? And I see that unitary spirit is what I think is the antithesis of power.

54:59.040 --> 55:03.680
I couldn't profess to know. And I think a lot of people have attempted to define even what

55:03.680 --> 55:09.840
art is. And I think people have failed. I've always liked Zola's definition of art as

55:09.840 --> 55:17.280
life seen through a temperament. The idea that what the artist does is attempt to present to you

55:18.160 --> 55:24.080
his view of the way that he sees the world on the understanding that we all see the world differently.

55:24.080 --> 55:29.600
And there is something quite beautiful about that, about expressing ourselves artistically.

55:29.600 --> 55:34.480
But it's not just variety. You know, you know, it's not just variety because there are qualitative

55:34.560 --> 55:42.240
distinctions between presentations of worldview. So I mean, Dostoevsky, Trump's 50 Shades of Gray,

55:42.240 --> 55:48.880
right? Because so there's a hierarchy of rank, right? And the greatest artists occupy the highest

55:48.880 --> 55:54.160
rank. And that is what tilts the more towards that transcendent unity, I think. It's something

55:54.160 --> 55:59.600
like that. Well, well, yeah, that's absolutely right. It's genius, isn't it? That's how the

55:59.600 --> 56:03.680
canon is formed. I mean, the canon is, you know, I think academics like to think that they're the

56:03.680 --> 56:08.880
ones who select what is in the canon. The canon is formed through influence, through to what extent

56:08.880 --> 56:15.760
other great artists borrow and innovate on the back of other artists. That's that same depth of

56:15.760 --> 56:20.720
presupposition that I was describing earlier, right? The more fundamental a text is, the more

56:20.720 --> 56:25.360
other texts depend on it. But the reason they do, the reason that artists do that is because obviously

56:25.440 --> 56:33.520
people like Michelangelo, Brahms, Dickens, Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, all of these are clearly

56:33.520 --> 56:37.840
the pinnacles of human achievement. They're achieving something that most of us simply cannot do.

56:37.840 --> 56:42.800
All we can do is look in awe at what they have achieved and other artists look in awe at that

56:42.800 --> 56:47.760
and try to come close to it, or at least, or in some cases of extreme genius build upon it.

56:48.160 --> 57:00.480
Well, there's a cardinal observation, because the hypothesis that you just put forward is something

57:00.480 --> 57:08.880
like the purpose of art is to, what would you say, to provoke the emulation of greatness.

57:08.880 --> 57:14.160
And that's based on the hypothesis that there is something transcendent that's great,

57:14.800 --> 57:18.880
you know? And that's that unity that I think that the arts are striving toward.

57:18.880 --> 57:22.480
Yeah, well, I don't know. I don't think it's conscious like that. I don't think that we...

57:22.480 --> 57:23.920
I don't think so either.

57:24.480 --> 57:31.840
And all I can say is that artists, I think, great art provokes something of the numinous

57:32.640 --> 57:37.840
in us. And whether that's religious or spiritual or godly or whatever, I don't know.

57:38.400 --> 57:39.280
But it's something that...

57:39.280 --> 57:42.960
Well, I think it is sort of by definition, right? I mean, you know what I mean?

57:42.960 --> 57:46.720
It's like, well, if that's not religious, then what is dogma?

57:46.720 --> 57:49.120
It's certainly religious on the experiential front.

57:49.120 --> 57:53.120
Yes, I suppose what I mean is it doesn't point to the existence of God necessarily.

57:53.120 --> 57:58.080
It just points to the existence of something beyond ourselves that we require in order to

57:58.080 --> 57:59.280
have a satisfactory life.

58:00.160 --> 58:01.760
That sounds a lot like God.

58:02.560 --> 58:03.840
Okay, well, that would be...

58:03.840 --> 58:06.560
Well, I'm not trying to be picky, you know?

58:06.560 --> 58:09.600
Well, that's the thing, man, because it is a matter of definition.

58:09.600 --> 58:14.160
You know, like, I don't think God...

58:15.200 --> 58:21.120
This transcendent unity that I've been tapping towards here is something like

58:22.000 --> 58:25.120
the central animating spirit of mankind at its best.

58:25.680 --> 58:26.720
It's something like that.

58:26.720 --> 58:28.800
Now, you might say, well, is that real?

58:28.800 --> 58:32.800
And that's not a good question because you have...

58:32.800 --> 58:37.120
You can't ask that question without bringing an a priori set of presuppositions about what

58:37.120 --> 58:39.600
constitutes real to bear on the question.

58:39.600 --> 58:43.920
Like, is it the same reality as the materialist atheists claim most real?

58:44.560 --> 58:45.440
Probably not.

58:46.320 --> 58:46.820
No.

58:46.820 --> 58:48.400
But that doesn't mean it's not real.

58:48.400 --> 58:50.720
It just means we can't agree on what constitutes real.

58:50.720 --> 58:54.000
Well, we can't agree on what constitutes a woman, so that's not surprising.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.920
Well, then let's suggest then that...

58:55.920 --> 59:01.840
Oh, let's agree that the critical social justice movement is essentially godless.

59:01.840 --> 59:03.520
I think it is godless.

59:03.520 --> 59:04.400
It doesn't have...

59:04.880 --> 59:08.320
It has no yearning after that sense of the numinous,

59:08.320 --> 59:10.640
and it has no capacity to produce it.

59:10.640 --> 59:14.320
That's why no great art has ever been produced from...

59:14.320 --> 59:19.760
Can you name a single woke activist who has produced a great work of art in any

59:19.760 --> 59:21.200
medium or any genre?

59:21.200 --> 59:22.320
Because I can't.

59:22.320 --> 59:22.720
I don't think...

59:22.720 --> 59:24.880
Okay, so that's an interesting...

59:24.880 --> 59:26.560
That's a very interesting observation.

59:26.560 --> 59:27.360
You know, what is it?

59:27.360 --> 59:30.400
The gospel statement, by their fruits, you will know them.

59:30.400 --> 59:32.400
So if they bear nothing but bitter fruit,

59:32.400 --> 59:37.440
then you might think they're worshiping the wrong god, or in your case, they're no god.

59:37.440 --> 59:40.720
But right, that was the criticism of the woke types.

59:40.720 --> 59:44.240
I think they worship power as a god, but whatever, we're close enough on that,

59:44.240 --> 59:45.440
so we don't have to discuss it.

59:45.440 --> 59:51.200
So let's talk about the artistic front here, because I see the scientists being mowed down

59:51.200 --> 59:55.280
like grass under a lawnmower by the woke activists, and that's going to continue,

59:55.280 --> 59:58.080
because the real scientists don't have a political bone in their body,

59:58.080 --> 01:00:00.080
and they have no idea what's coming for them.

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:04.880
But I'm particularly sickened by the bloody artists, because the only thing they have to

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:08.240
offer is this connection to the truly numinous.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.000
That's true across art forms, right?

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.360
They point to the numinous, and they're willing, increasingly,

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:17.920
to subordinate that to ideology order, remain silent in the face of this onslaught,

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:20.960
to bolster their moral self-righteousness.

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:21.520
Yeah, that's really different for us.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.120
They're cutting their own throats.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.080
It's horrible to watch.

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:28.560
It's horrible to witness, because genius, artistic genius, can only come about by those

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:34.480
who can think outside the box, who are not conformists, ultimately.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:38.720
This is a movement that demands conformity, and artists of all people are the ones

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:39.520
who are going along with it.

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.760
Now, to an extent, I suppose, that's always happened, though.

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:44.160
I mean, it must have always happened, because people, artists,

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.520
have to get on with the business of living.

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:50.720
Back in my renaissance period, the area that I studied from my doctorate,

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.560
you had patrons.

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:55.520
You had patrons of the arts in society who would effectively say,

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:59.120
to William Shakespeare, for instance, when King James patronized William Shakespeare's

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:02.240
company, the King's Men, it went from being the Lord Chamberlain's Men to the King's Men,

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:07.280
and he said, they were patronized, but Shakespeare could write whatever he wanted.

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:12.240
The great patrons are the ones who don't try to steer the artists in a certain way.

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:16.640
I mean, sure, you would get, for instance, at the start of Shakespeare's narrative poem,

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:24.640
Venus and Adonis, you have this sort of sycophantic passage about the person to whom it is dedicated,

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:30.880
Henry Ruthsley, the Earl, and that's because Shakespeare also needed to live at that point.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.560
He wasn't yet a rich man at that point.

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:36.080
He became very, very rich ultimately, but at that point, he wasn't.

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:45.360
So artists do require an income, and in our day and age, in order for an artist to be employed,

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.600
they have to satisfy a set of demands by the gatekeepers of various industries.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:56.400
That's theatre, the publishing industry, comedy industry, television, executives, commissioners,

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.360
all of those kind of things.

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:03.200
The problem is that at the moment, all of those people are entirely captured by the woke ideology.

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:08.560
They are all, it's foot soldiers, or at least even in some cases, I suppose you could call them,

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:09.280
it's clergy.

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:12.240
And so they make these demands to artists.

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:17.680
And I suppose, unless you are independently wealthy, what choice have you?

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:23.840
In other words, what this thing does is we can't all be a van Gogh living in complete poverty,

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.120
doing whatever the hell he wanted.

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:31.280
Well, that's a very sympathetic account, and I have some sympathy for that account,

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:37.920
because I've seen people, many, many people who've faced the threat of cancellation

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:43.280
and are terrified by it, not least often because they have a family to support, let's say.

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:48.400
But let me push back on that a little bit.

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.880
And you tell me if you think there's any flaws in this.

01:02:50.880 --> 01:03:02.400
Okay, so look, as far as I can tell, your best bet in life is to play the most transcendent,

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.680
iterable strategy.

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:07.920
And because you're going to pay a price for what you do, no matter what you do.

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:11.440
You're going to pay, in fact, you're going to pay the ultimate price, no matter what you do.

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.920
So you're already screwed in the fundamental analysis.

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:19.840
Now, and that means that you're, the fact that you're going to pay means that you're always

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.120
confronted with a choice.

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:26.240
And the choice is to say what you believe to be true and take the consequences,

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:30.400
or to fail to say what you believe to be true and take the consequences.

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:36.640
Now, people will say, well, I don't want to speak right now because look at the consequences.

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:39.920
And I would say, well, that's always why people have lied throughout history,

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:43.520
is to avoid the consequences or to get something they don't deserve.

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:48.640
And so I could say, from the judgment perspective, rather than the mercy perspective,

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:53.120
especially to artists, it's like, I don't give a damn about your financial need.

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:57.680
The only thing you have to offer the world is the purity of your vision.

01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:02.000
And if you sacrifice that while you're killing the goose that lays the golden eggs,

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.400
and you might be protected in the short term, but they're going to come for you in the future.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.800
There may be a lot of these creative people are thinking to themselves,

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:12.560
I will play the game as far as I need to, so that I can establish myself,

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.560
and then I can make my own artistic choices.

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:15.680
That's how many times- Yeah, right.

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:18.080
Doesn't work. That's what the faculty did.

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:22.720
They said over and over as they rose up the ladder from graduate student to professor.

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:26.000
Well, once I have tenure, I'll be brave.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.680
It's like, that isn't how it works.

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:29.920
You don't get braver because you're more pretentious.

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:33.760
Okay, so you didn't do that, so why didn't you do it?

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:40.000
Look, I completely share your sense of dismay, and particularly from artists.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.120
You know, I think the world of academia is rather more careerist, I think.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:49.760
And so, although I think it's just as unforgivable, it's more understandable.

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:56.480
I think to be an artist, you have to be the kind of person whose soul fealty is to your muse.

01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:57.360
It has to be that.

01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:00.160
Otherwise, you're not really an artist in any serious sense at all.

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:05.040
You have to be creating what it is you are personally impelled to create, whatever drives you.

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:09.280
And you know, there are some people who have done that in history.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:15.040
William Blake was poor throughout his life, died in poverty,

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:20.080
and he could see all these mediocre people playing the game and becoming rich,

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:21.600
but he couldn't do it.

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:23.360
He was too much of an authentic artist.

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:25.920
He wasn't able to do that.

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:28.880
And I wish all artists could have that.

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:33.280
But the other thing about that is actually very few people are great artists.

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:39.360
Most people are sort of peddlers of popular culture or, you know, kind of functional hacks

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:43.920
that people can produce the entertainment that actually we do really need and require.

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:45.840
Like, I'm not trying to denigrate popular culture.

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:46.960
I think it's really, really important.

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:49.440
But it's not the same as great art, right?

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:55.440
So pop music, I really enjoy pop music, but I don't pretend to myself that it's Brahms.

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.920
You know, we have those hierarchies.

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:00.400
Hierarchies, by the way, which the woke would like to tear down and say,

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:04.800
that's all about the implementation of power again and the implement implementation of privilege.

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:07.200
They will say there's no difference between a...

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.800
There's no such thing as quality.

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.960
No, no, no, exactly, exactly.

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.480
Because it's all about subjective feeling.

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:17.040
And they would say that there's no difference between an Elton John song and a Beethoven symphony.

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.160
They'll say there's no difference there.

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:22.400
It's just about, you know, and to pretend that there is is a problem in and of itself.

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.720
And that's why I think there are two things.

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.840
The way that artists could really be supported in this

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.560
partly comes from academia, partly comes from literary theorists

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:35.440
and people who, by the way, I think have completely lost the plot.

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:39.200
But they need to retain the primacy of the canon, of the Western canon.

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:44.480
They need to say, actually, there are certain works of art that are greater than others.

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:46.960
They need to be able to be bold enough to say that.

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:54.400
Rather than stripping away Chaucer or Shakespeare or Marlowe or whatever from the canon

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:59.600
to make way for mediocre writers who happen to represent a marginalized group identity.

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:06.000
Well, I see in that, again, this re-emergence of the spirit of Cain.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.560
Because Cain, imagine you're a mediocre artist, want to be.

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:14.080
And part of the reason for that maybe isn't so much that you're talentless,

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:15.680
although that might have something to do with it,

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:20.080
but that you're unwilling to say a true word or to paint a true brush stroke.

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.480
You're too cowardly, so you're not going anywhere.

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:25.600
Okay, so you're getting irritated and resentful

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:28.640
because your sacrifices aren't being appreciated by God.

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.240
And so what do you do?

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:33.680
Well, if you're Cain, you destroy your own ideal, right?

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:36.480
Because that's what Cain says to God,

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:38.320
my punishment is more than I can bear.

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.880
Now, that's a very ambiguous phrase,

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:42.960
because you can't tell exactly what it refers to.

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:45.520
But as far as I can tell, what he means is,

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:50.640
well, I've really spent my whole life miserable and jealous because I'm not able,

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:53.760
and I want to be more than anything else.

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.560
And now I've gone and killed my own ideal.

01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:00.240
And so how can I live? I've killed my own ideal.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:05.120
Well, that's what these bloody woke artists want to be types are doing.

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.520
It's not just even the woke, this predates the woke.

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:11.440
Harold Bloom used to, the great literary theorist used to write about

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:15.040
the critical theorists, the identitarian theorists of the 90s

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:17.200
as being the theorists of resentment.

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:18.560
That's what he called them.

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:20.640
I think that's exactly right.

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:24.720
It started way back in the 60s with feminist writers trying to problematize

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:28.480
writers such as D.H. Lawrence or Norman Mail or whoever it might be,

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:32.240
Ernest Hemingway, whatever, saying that these writers are sexist.

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:35.600
I mean, when I was studying as an undergraduate for English literature,

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:39.120
you basically got the highest marks if you problematized texts.

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:43.760
If you went through a play and teased out the homophobic elements or the racist elements,

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:46.880
you'd get rewarded almost like you were kind of a kind of moral detective.

01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:48.800
And I think it all started there.

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:49.840
It goes way back to the past.

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:52.480
Well, so then I would say that's part of the

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.360
prideful hubris of the intellect.

01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:00.480
So you have these second rate creative wannabes in English departments, let's say.

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:04.000
And instead of worshiping the spirit of Shakespeare,

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.280
which is what they should properly be doing and transmitting that to students,

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:12.640
they elevate their critical capacity over and above the creative capacity of the artist,

01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:16.160
lay moral claim to the integrity of their arguments,

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:21.600
and then propagandize to the students who pay $50,000 a year for the privilege.

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.960
Which is why I go back to humility, because I think the only sensible

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:28.720
or intelligent approach to Shakespeare is humility.

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:31.200
Similarly, you know, when we saw recently the publishing house,

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:35.520
which publishing house was it that decided to rewrite P.G. Woodhouse's novels?

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.360
P.G. Woodhouse is the greatest comic prose stylist in the English language.

01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:45.200
The idea that a group of 20-something activists in a publishing house think that

01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:47.040
they can write better than Woodhouse,

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:51.120
think that they can improve his work by this sort of horrendous, bolderized version.

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.160
Especially morally.

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:55.120
Of course morally, it's all based on morals.

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:57.360
So it's so infuriating.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:01.120
I mean, it makes me very, very angry because it's the arrogance of that

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:04.240
that I find absolutely stunning.

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:06.480
But similarly with productions of Shakespeare, so there's...

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:11.840
I just saw a review the other day for a production of Julius Caesar

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.440
by the Royal Shakespeare Company.

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.920
By all accounts, it's just an identitarian mess.

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:21.120
It's just taking the play and just reshaping it to promote

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:24.880
vogue-ish ideas that are in fashion at the moment

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:28.640
about group identity and the primacy of group identity and power structures, etc.

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.720
And therefore they're missing the entire play.

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:35.200
And as an audience member, this is why I think it's better to read Shakespeare at this point.

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:41.120
Because as an audience member, you are subject to whatever interpretation

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.720
the director wants to impose on it.

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:46.000
And if that director is really a preacher in disguise,

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.320
then you're just going to get a sermon, not a play.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.040
That seems to me what's happening over and over again.

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:54.480
I saw today, actually, there was an article about Macbeth.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:57.840
Trigger warning.

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.400
It's a trigger warning on Macbeth at the University in Belfast,

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.400
at Queen's University in Belfast, right?

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:05.680
Now, those people are studying a module on Shakespeare.

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.360
And it's actually even a secondary module.

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:10.160
They already have a decent knowledge of the subject.

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:16.400
This is like an advanced module where they are to really get into the weeds with this great writer.

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:18.960
And to put a trigger warning in that is to say

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:23.280
that the way that we need to perceive these great texts

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:27.600
is through our particularly obsessive, moralistic,

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:31.920
identitarian lens, and that we have to see them as morally dangerous texts,

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:33.760
potentially dangerous texts, toxicity.

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:36.160
Maybe they're exactly right on that front.

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:38.240
Because if you are a woke propagandist,

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:41.600
there is nothing more dangerous to you than the spirit of Shakespeare.

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:43.600
Sure. And there is something dangerous, actually,

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:46.720
particularly about Macbeth, I think, because in Macbeth,

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:50.160
I mean, I think Macbeth is one of Shakespeare's greatest plays.

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:53.120
And I think one of the reasons why I always found it disturbing,

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:56.400
even as a child, even though I didn't really know why I found it disturbing as a child,

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.240
because it's one of those that gets on school text,

01:11:58.240 --> 01:11:59.280
because it's such a short one.

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:02.800
But actually, when you watch it, it isn't like you're...

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:08.880
Shakespeare created so many great embodiments of evil,

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:12.480
people like Yago in Othello, or Edmund in King Lear,

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:14.640
or Aaron in Titus Andronicus, these figures.

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:17.680
But Macbeth is different, because with Macbeth,

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:22.800
you go along with Macbeth knowing that it could be you.

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.320
I think it's the closest to what...

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:27.440
When you write about Solzhenitsyn talking about

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:30.080
the line of good and evil cutting through the heart of every man,

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:31.520
that to me is Macbeth.

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:36.080
Because Macbeth is like this incredible representation of,

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.240
what if we lived in a world where we didn't have free will?

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:41.360
Macbeth knows everything he is doing is wrong,

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:42.880
and cannot stop it from happening.

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:45.760
And it's like when you're watching it,

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.440
if you're watching a good production of Macbeth,

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:50.400
you are Macbeth, right?

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.160
And you're falling into this vortex.

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:54.480
That's why I think...

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:58.080
Well, that's actually like a definition of great literature.

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:02.640
I think literature almost always portrays something like

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:06.240
a romantic adventure, and then something like

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:08.000
the battle of good against evil,

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.240
depending on how that's laid out, right?

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:12.480
It's a romantic battle of good against evil.

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:16.720
Okay, but the great literary authors

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:21.040
place that battle in the soul of a single individual, right?

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:24.640
So that each character contains the entire landscape

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:25.760
of the cosmic battle.

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:29.120
Instead of there being some characters parsed out as good,

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:31.600
and other characters parsed out as villainous.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:34.000
And so then when you sit in the audience,

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:36.640
and you experience that,

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:40.000
you're experiencing the divine drama in your own soul.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.160
Yeah, and that is distilting, right?

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:44.080
Let me throw you something at you.

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:48.800
So I went to Jerusalem with Jonathan Pazio,

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:52.560
and Pazio is about the deepest religious thinker I ever encountered.

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:55.040
And he was a postmodernist for a good while,

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:57.280
and so is expert in that domain as well,

01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:59.600
which makes him a particularly vicious critic now

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.240
of the postmodernist types.

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:05.920
Anyways, we walk the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem.

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:13.200
And what that is, so if you imagine a tragic story,

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:14.400
then you embody that.

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:17.920
And the ultimate tragic story is the worst possible thing

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:20.480
happening to the best possible person, right?

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:25.280
That's the pinnacle towards which all tragedy strives,

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.240
you might say.

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:31.360
And walking the Via Dolorosa is an exercise in literary experience.

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:35.840
Because the point of that pilgrimage, so to speak,

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:41.120
is to place yourself not only in the role of the recipient

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:42.720
of all that brutality,

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:46.560
but also in the role of the deliverer of the brutality, right?

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:51.440
Imagine yourself as the mob, as yourself as the best friend

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:56.800
who betrays, as the intellectually hubristic Pharisee

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:59.760
and scribe, as the hapless ruler of Rome.

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.040
That's all you.

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:03.680
And that's what literature does, it walks you through that.

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:08.720
And I think Macbeth and Macbeth and plays of that magnitude

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:14.640
are threatening to the woke types, most particularly,

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:20.400
because they do require that pilgrimage of moral inquiry.

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:23.040
And that does upset the ideological apple cart.

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:24.480
So they hate art, they hate art,

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:26.880
because it pushes past propaganda always.

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:28.960
Exactly, and that's why the passion of the Christ

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:32.400
is the most powerful story and the most enduring story,

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:36.240
not story, but account of the brutality that we...

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.720
I mean, when you read about the experience of Jesus

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:41.440
on the way to Calvary, can any of us be sure

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:43.440
that we wouldn't be among the jeering mobs

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:44.080
throwing the stones?

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:45.600
No, we can be sure we would be.

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.680
We can be certain we would be.

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:49.200
The woke don't agree with that, do they?

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.920
Because the woke like to judge the past,

01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:55.920
and they will say that if I had lived in the antebellum south,

01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:57.360
if I had lived in the Civil War,

01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:59.200
I would have been the ones trying to free the slaves.

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:00.400
I wouldn't have been a slave owner.

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.320
I wouldn't have been one of those people

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:05.280
who supported racial segregation.

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:06.400
But of course they would.

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.760
And in fact, they would have been the first ones.

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:09.600
So, okay, so let's...

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:11.600
All right, so I've been thinking

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:15.200
about this mythological motif of the harrowing of hell.

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:20.240
So what happens in this ultimate tragedy

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:22.000
is that, well, first of all,

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.640
the best possible person is put to death

01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:27.360
by the worst possible people in the worst possible way.

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:29.840
And you might think, well, that's as bad as it gets.

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:30.080
Right?

01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:33.120
Because sort of by definition, that's as bad as it gets.

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:35.440
But you know, that isn't as bad as it gets.

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:38.080
And that's pretty awful because, you know,

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.600
you just pointed to something

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:40.880
is that if you're looking at history

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.480
and you have any bloody sense,

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:45.120
you think, I wouldn't have been a victim or a hero.

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:46.560
I would have been a perpetrator

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.240
because most people were perpetrators.

01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:50.880
Although, you know, there were plenty of victims.

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:52.240
I would have been a perpetrator.

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:53.760
And so then when you realize

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:56.240
that you likely would have been a perpetrator

01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:00.240
and that you probably are at the moment unbeknownst to yourself,

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.000
well, then you're facing something,

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.400
I think, that is in some ways worse than death.

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:05.760
I think it's hell.

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:08.800
I actually think that is that you have to understand

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:12.080
that there is a part of you that would willingly dwell in hell

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:14.480
before you can rescue yourself from it at all.

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.880
You know, and I think that's what we're called to do

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:18.720
in the aftermath of the 20th century

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:21.680
and the horrors of Auschwitz to wake up and think,

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:23.360
oh my God, there's something inside us

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:26.320
that's so malevolent that to gaze upon it for a second

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:28.800
is to suffer for nightmares from nightmares

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.160
for the rest of your life.

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:32.480
But that that's also your moral obligation.

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:34.880
And that seems to me what the harrowing of hell is, right?

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:36.960
It's the descent through death

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:39.040
into the realm of malevolence itself

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:41.440
and to take that onto yourself.

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:44.800
So when the woke try to police art,

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:50.160
apply trigger warnings to art, censor it, remove scenes, et cetera,

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:54.880
are they, in your view, attempting to prevent that experience,

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:58.240
that necessary human experience of confronting

01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:59.920
the worst possible version of yourself?

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:01.200
Is that what they're doing?

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:02.960
That's what it looks like to me.

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:05.280
I mean, I think they're protecting themselves

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:07.360
from chaotic complexity,

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:09.840
but that also denies them possibility.

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:11.680
So that's terrible and hope.

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:13.280
But more importantly,

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:16.560
they're trying to shuffle off the responsibility

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.560
of confronting Satan in the desert.

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:19.520
So there's something,

01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:21.520
well, I mean, there's something quite understandable

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:22.400
about all of that, isn't there?

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:24.560
Because it is uncomfortable.

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:27.280
I mean, people have done this with the arts forever.

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.280
When, I mean, one of the most interesting things

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.200
I think about King Lear, for instance,

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:32.560
the Shakespeare's King Lear,

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:37.600
is that that was not the, after 1680, roughly 1680,

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:39.760
his version wasn't on the stage anymore.

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:42.240
It was rewritten by a guy called Neham Tate.

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:43.600
And that was the version of King Lear

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:45.840
that was on the stage for 150 years.

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:48.880
And in that version, you have a happy ending.

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:50.720
You don't have Lear come in,

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:53.680
cradling his daughter who's been hanged,

01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:56.880
because they couldn't cope with that.

01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:57.760
They couldn't cope.

01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.760
And it's not just, it's not just,

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.600
because I think King Lear, of all his plays,

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:03.600
really represents this complete baron.

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:04.400
I mean, it is baron.

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:05.680
It's pre-Christian.

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:06.560
It is godless.

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:10.240
It's this society where exactly what you describe,

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:14.320
the best type of person has the worst possible experience.

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:15.440
In spite of what critics have said,

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:18.960
Lear is meant to be much loved, a great ruler,

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:23.360
who is subjected to this endless cruelty

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:26.000
that ultimately ends in an unbearable moment.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.720
The unbearable moment is Cordelia coming in dead.

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.800
His fall has been hanged.

01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:33.760
It is complete nihilism.

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:37.920
This is a play that makes you think,

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:39.280
what if there was nothing else?

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:40.640
What if there was no god?

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:42.800
What if being good didn't matter?

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.280
What if the very worst things happened to the best?

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:46.400
And they couldn't handle it.

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:49.040
So the Neham Tate version was what people went to see.

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:51.440
And in the end, Cordelia gets married to Edgar.

01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:52.400
And it's a happy ending.

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:54.720
And although that seems like a travesty to us,

01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:57.280
it actually makes sense to me as well.

01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:01.120
It makes sense why audience goers didn't want to confront that.

01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:02.240
Why would they?

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:05.840
Well, I don't think they would,

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:08.080
but I think the horrible truth might be that

01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:11.200
the only way to paradise is through death and hell.

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:12.320
Right.

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:15.840
And that's like, I'm not saying that with any degree of satisfaction,

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:16.640
but I don't see it.

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.200
Because look, one of the things I tried to do,

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:22.560
I took my studies of Auschwitz in particular,

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:24.880
but also the Gulag really seriously.

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:26.000
I was trying to figure out

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:28.640
what I could do.

01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:31.600
Well, I tried to put myself in the position

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:34.320
of an Auschwitz camp guard who kind of enjoyed his job.

01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:36.000
Right.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.200
And the horrible thing is you can put yourself in that position.

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:41.200
And the horrible thing about that is you discover

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:43.920
all sorts of things about yourself there by doing so

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:46.320
that you pretty much wish you never discovered.

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:50.400
But the upside, and I suppose this is the redemptive upside,

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:53.760
is that if you recognize within yourself

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:56.240
the source of all malevolence and evil,

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:58.880
if you can actually do that, if you'll look at that,

01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:00.480
then you can transcend it.

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:02.080
But there's no other way.

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:03.200
There's no pretense.

01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:06.160
And so I've been terrified of this for decades.

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:07.840
It's what I taught my students at Harvard

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:09.120
and at the University of Toronto.

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:11.760
I said, you have to take upon yourself

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:13.440
the sins of the perpetrator in order

01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:15.840
to rectify the catastrophe of the Holocaust.

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:18.400
You know, weirdly and perversely,

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:21.680
the leftist radicals in some demented way

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:23.360
are insisting upon that, right?

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.960
They say, well, the problem is,

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:29.200
is they put the onus on the souls of other people.

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:31.760
They say, well, look, you powerful people,

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:34.960
you white people, you privileged group people,

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:36.160
you're the perpetrators.

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:38.880
It's like, no, god damn it, you're the perpetrator.

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:40.800
It's really hard, though, for them to put themselves

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.960
in that position and for them to confront

01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:46.480
that aspect of their own soul, if we want to call it that.

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.080
Yeah, it's the hardest thing.

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:49.360
It's the hardest thing.

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:52.400
But also, they can't do it because they don't recognize

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.320
their own behavior for what it is.

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:56.960
They don't see that they are the cruelest of the cruel.

01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:59.360
They don't see that they are themselves

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:01.520
capable of all sorts of monstrosities

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:03.120
because I've seen the way they behave.

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:04.480
Well, it also might be, Andrew,

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:06.240
that they don't see anything like,

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:11.040
something has to, okay, I always believe

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:12.720
that if you understood something,

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:15.520
you could find your way forward.

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:16.640
Like, I would say that's,

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:18.560
and I think my father helped me with that

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:19.920
in some deep way, right?

01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:21.680
He instilled that in me in some way.

01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:22.800
I don't really understand.

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:25.600
And I've always been convinced of that.

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:30.800
And so one of the consequences of that

01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:33.840
is the idea that, well, if you can take it

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:37.200
upon yourself to gaze into the abyss,

01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:39.360
let's say as deep as you possibly can,

01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:41.280
that what you will see eventually

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:43.280
if you look hard enough is the light.

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:44.880
But you know, you have to believe

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:46.720
that the light is a possibility, right?

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:49.200
And maybe that's the fundamental axiom

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:52.000
of an appropriate faith, is the light is a possibility.

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:54.320
And if all you believe is that power rules,

01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:57.200
well, how can you look upon evil without despair?

01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:59.760
And what are the consequences for humanity

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:01.600
if you have a ruling ideology

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:03.360
that doesn't enable any of us

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:04.960
to have that experience anymore?

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:05.600
Because that seems to me to be also-

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:07.200
Well, we know what the consequences

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:08.880
we saw in the 20th century.

01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:09.760
Right.

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:11.280
Right?

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:12.400
Many, many times.

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:16.240
Well, I suppose then, it's not too alarmist

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:17.840
to say that that's where the woke are leading us.

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:19.120
Certainly the spiritual.

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.400
That's what it looks like to me.

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:26.160
Well, no comedy, no art, no literature, right?

01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:31.520
No science, no free speech, no redemption from guilt.

01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:32.400
Yes.

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:34.240
No genuine individual identity,

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:36.000
no up, no down, right?

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.880
Just a desert of barren endeavor, right?

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:41.200
Yes.

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:43.360
With maybe some impulsive hedonism

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:44.480
thrown in now and then to-

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:48.400
And yet they would deny everything you've just said.

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:50.240
They would deny every claim that you're making there.

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.960
They would say they're not trying to do any of that at all.

01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:54.560
That they want to preserve art.

01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:56.160
They want free speech to flourish.

01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:58.800
They just want to protect marginalized communities

01:23:58.800 --> 01:23:59.520
within that.

01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:00.960
That would be their argument.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:02.640
So it's very difficult to combat.

01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:05.680
Yeah, well, the marginalized community argument

01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:07.120
is a very interesting one too.

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:08.640
I've been trying to work that through,

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:09.840
especially with Pajot.

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:12.800
You know, and he helped me walk through

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:15.120
the idea of the center and the fringe

01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:16.320
in the biblical corpus.

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:19.440
And so there's an idea, for example,

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:25.600
in the ancient geography of the ancient Israelite times,

01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:30.400
the poor were allowed to glean on the edges of the fields.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:32.320
Right?

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:35.840
So there was a border of uncertainty around,

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:38.240
what would you say?

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:40.240
Around a demarcated territory.

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:43.200
And that border of uncertainty was where

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:46.560
the marginalized were allowed to thrive.

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:48.720
And so there does have to be a center,

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:49.920
and there has to be a margin.

01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:52.240
But if you bring the margin to the center,

01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:54.800
you destroy the center, and you destroy the margin.

01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:58.880
And that's partly why I don't buy the postmodern claim

01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:01.200
that it's compassion that's driving

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.680
the centering of the marginalized,

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:07.280
because that's a serpent that eats its own tail.

01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:09.280
And I think what we're seeing happen right now

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:12.320
on the LGBT front is that the fringe of the fringe

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.000
is devouring the fringe.

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:19.280
Faster than the center even, because you know that most of the kids

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:23.200
who are surgically transitioned would have been gay.

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:25.280
It's 80%, right?

01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:27.120
So that's pretty damn interesting.

01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:30.480
Well, that might be the thing that breaks it apart.

01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:32.080
I wonder if that's the thing that breaks it apart,

01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:36.800
because there is now a schism within this LGBTQIA2S+,

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:40.080
whatever you want to call it, community,

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:41.200
which doesn't exist anyway.

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:44.080
And the schism is precisely what you described,

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:46.080
which is that gender identity ideology

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:51.920
is not just a fanciful theory,

01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:55.280
a quasi-religious way of viewing the world.

01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:57.280
It's also actively anti-gay.

01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:01.040
And so far as it does suggest,

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:03.440
well, firstly, it denies homosexuality,

01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:06.400
because homosexuality and gay rights have always been predicated

01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:08.560
on the recognition that a minority of people

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:10.320
are attracted to members of their own sex.

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:14.400
It eliminates that by saying there's no such thing as same-sex attraction,

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:18.000
and that actually you should be attracted to gender or gender identity.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:21.760
This is why Stonewall, which is the UK's foremost LGBT charity,

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:24.960
redefined the word homosexual on their website

01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:27.920
to say it's same gender attracted.

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:31.120
I wrote an article recently about this, and I mentioned Nancy Kelly.

01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:33.600
Non-women being attracted to other non-women.

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:34.080
Right, oh my goodness.

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:35.200
No, non-men.

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:37.280
Non-men being attracted to other non-men.

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:38.400
That was great, man.

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:40.400
That's the definition of lesbian now is non-men.

01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:42.320
They're attracted to non-men.

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:43.440
It's unbelievable.

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:46.480
And Nancy Kelly, the CEO of Stonewall,

01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:50.560
has said that women who want to exclude biological men

01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:52.880
from their dating pool are sexual racists,

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:54.400
or akin to sexual racists.

01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:55.520
Well, that's the logical.

01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:56.720
That's the logical.

01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:00.960
I said this five years ago in a discussion I had at Queen's University.

01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:04.480
It's like, well, you don't think discrimination is right.

01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:05.440
No, we don't.

01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:07.120
Well, how about sexual discrimination?

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:08.720
Should you just lay down on the ground

01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:11.280
and spread your legs for every comer, so to speak?

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:14.400
Because you're certainly being discriminatory if you don't.

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:16.080
Like, really, like, fundamentally,

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:19.040
that is the most egregious form of discrimination.

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:20.000
They're right about that.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:20.400
Absolutely.

01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:22.240
A sexual orientation is a form of discrimination.

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:24.880
Like, she says you're like a sexual racist

01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:26.320
if you don't want to sleep with someone with a penis

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:27.120
and you're a woman.

01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:28.480
No, you're just homosexual.

01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:30.080
She's describing homosexuality there,

01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:32.640
but she's saying that homosexuality is itself bigoted.

01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:35.600
And that's coming from the head of the gay rights,

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:37.520
the foremost gay rights charity in this country.

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:38.480
That's insane.

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.560
The inversions are incredible.

01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:44.880
You know, when I was at school, the kids who were effeminate,

01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:46.160
the boys who were effeminate,

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:48.000
who didn't want to play football and all the rest of it,

01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:50.080
the bullies called them girls.

01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:50.960
They said, you're just girls.

01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:52.080
You're not even a proper boy.

01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:53.280
You're not a real boy.

01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:56.160
That's what Mermaids and Stonewall says now.

01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:57.680
They say, that's what the Tavistock was doing.

01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:00.240
They're saying, you're basically probably trapped in the wrong body.

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:01.360
Let's fix you.

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:04.080
Like you say, between 80 and 90% of adolescents

01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:06.400
referred to the Tavistock Clinic are same-sex attracted.

01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:07.760
Well, that's what they do in Tehran.

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:10.640
That's the head of gender transformation,

01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:12.400
sex transformation surgery in the world.

01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.560
Which is really quite something.

01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:18.640
The mothers in Tehran and the heads of Stonewall are peas in a pod.

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:22.400
They're totally, they feel the same way about homosexuality.

01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:26.160
Iran and Pakistan for a while, although not anymore,

01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:29.360
were funding same-sex change operations

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:31.440
because they hang gay people from cranes.

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:35.360
That's why you get the death penalty for being gay.

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:38.240
So of course they want to heterosexualize and fix gay people.

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:40.160
But I would never have seen this coming.

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:41.120
None of us did.

01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:42.720
I've spoken to all these gay activists

01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:44.640
who've come out of retirement basically,

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:46.320
and they're like, we never saw it coming.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.160
It's more dangerous now to be a gay kid

01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:51.600
than it was when I was growing up.

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:54.160
Far more dangerous when I was growing up.

01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:55.040
Oh, yes.

01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:55.520
Yeah.

01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:57.920
So you guys were actually doing pretty good under the,

01:28:58.560 --> 01:28:58.960
what would you say?

01:28:58.960 --> 01:28:59.840
We were doing all right.

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:02.480
The thumb of the Judeo-Christian fascists

01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:05.920
instead of the tender mercies of the T-activist types.

01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:09.200
You know, we had the government implementing a thing called Section 28

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:13.360
where they said that teachers couldn't mention homosexuality in schools

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:15.200
unless they linked it to AIDS.

01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:16.080
That's not great.

01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:17.600
That's a terrible situation to be in.

01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:19.760
So there was that.

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:22.960
So we had anti-gay ideas from members of staff.

01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:23.280
Fine.

01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:27.680
If you were out as a gay kid, which no one was, by the way,

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:28.800
you would be beaten up.

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:30.320
You would be bullied.

01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:31.680
You would be abused, right?

01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:34.800
But what you wouldn't have is the figures in authority

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:36.320
wanting to chop your dick off.

01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:40.400
And that's so it's much more dangerous now.

01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:44.240
Like you wouldn't have politicians and the media

01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:47.440
and the commentary and gay charity saying,

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:49.120
maybe we need to fix you.

01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:50.240
Maybe we need to sterilize you.

01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:53.200
So let me ask you a question about that.

01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:54.400
And this is one that's really,

01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:56.400
well, I don't know what to make of it.

01:29:56.800 --> 01:30:01.200
I just like the stereotypical guy who says he's not bigoted.

01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:04.000
I have a lot of gay friends, and they're people I really admire.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.600
So Bjorn Lomburg, Douglas Murray, you, Andy Know.

01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:08.880
That's four.

01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:11.360
Those are pretty stellar examples, by the way.

01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:13.440
I have a sneaking suspicion, by the way,

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:17.440
that the genetic configuration that leads to male homosexuality

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:21.040
is integrally tied up with creativity itself.

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:23.440
And that's why it sustains itself in the gene pool.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.040
That is fascinating.

01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:27.520
If true, put it aside, because I've always wondered

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:29.920
why you have this disproportionate correlation

01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:31.760
of homosexuality and art.

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:34.800
Another possibility too, which is that if you happen to get

01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:38.160
the balance between masculine and feminine qualities

01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:42.400
exactly right as a man, you are hyper attractive to women.

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:45.360
So that's another possibility.

01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:50.080
So you could think of homosexuality as an overshoot of that target.

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:53.360
Now, I'm speculating, although I think the creativity hypothesis

01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:54.240
is a better one.

01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:56.960
Imagine that homosexuality is polygenetic,

01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:00.720
but it's associated with a much higher probability of creativity.

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:03.280
Well, then obviously it's going to be conserved,

01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:06.720
even though it has lack of reproductive ability.

01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:10.000
It has to be associated with something stellar,

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.680
because obviously it would just disappear.

01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:15.520
So and gay men are radically overrepresented

01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:17.600
in creative disciplines, like radically.

01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:19.680
If you can get to the heart of why that is,

01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:20.960
I'd be absolutely fascinated by that.

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:22.720
But that was a side point, wasn't it?

01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:24.640
That was a side point from what you wanted to say about.

01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:27.200
Yeah. Well, here is what I wanted to ask you about.

01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:28.640
And I don't know what to do about this.

01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:30.640
It's like, I think that part of the problem

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:33.440
that we're trying to figure out is back 20 years ago,

01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:38.080
we did what we could to bring, especially male homosexuality,

01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:42.480
into the center by legalizing gay marriage

01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:45.600
and by attempting to normalize it in some ways.

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:49.680
Now, I think that left a lot of questions unanswered.

01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:50.880
So here's one question.

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:53.840
It's like, well, okay, now if it's normalized all of a sudden,

01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:58.640
same-sex relationships, same-sex sexual relationships,

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:02.720
where do you draw the line and what the hell do you teach children?

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:06.640
And one answer would be, you don't talk about sex at all.

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:07.840
And another answer would be, well,

01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:10.320
you talk about gay sex 50% of the time.

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:15.200
I don't know what the answer is, but it really is a problem.

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:18.080
And I think we're dashing ourself to pieces

01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:19.840
in some ways trying to solve that problem.

01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:23.360
I don't know what the hell the solution in the US

01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:25.760
is take your kids out of the school system.

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:27.600
That's what the solution seems to be.

01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:29.920
So, but I don't know what you think about all that.

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:31.200
It's so difficult because I think

01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:33.440
educationists at the moment are getting it very, very wrong

01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:35.600
in terms of what they're teaching children about sex

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:37.840
and gender and sexuality and all the rest of it.

01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:39.520
And I think gay people are bearing the brunt

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:41.440
of a lot of the blame here, you know?

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:43.680
So I think what's happening is, you know,

01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:46.720
when you have drag queens twerking in front of children

01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:47.760
or stripping in front of children or whatever.

01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:49.120
Yeah, that doesn't seem good.

01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:50.240
It doesn't look good.

01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:54.000
And because they have bracketed us all as LGBTQIA+,

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.600
this is one big thing, then, you know,

01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:00.800
and there's evidence, isn't there, that homophobia

01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:02.160
or at least I don't really like the word,

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.640
but anti-gay sentiment is on the rise

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:06.080
because I think they think this is,

01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:08.240
they think this is gay people doing all of this stuff.

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:09.840
It's not, it's gender ideologues.

01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:11.920
It's gender ideologues who have taken over

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:14.000
the LGBT community, whatever that might be.

01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:17.040
And as I've said, gender ideology

01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:18.880
is actively hostile to homosexuality.

01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:25.200
So gay people aren't the agents of these societal changes.

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:26.480
They're the victims of it,

01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:28.160
because now I'm getting it from both sides.

01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:32.400
So I published that article in the mail about the Pride flag,

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:36.080
and I was getting gender ideologues piling in on me,

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:39.600
calling me evil and telling me I should kill myself

01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:41.200
and, you know, the lovely things

01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:42.640
that the compassionate people often say.

01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:46.000
And then I was also getting right-wing people,

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.240
mostly from America, calling me a sodomite

01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:49.360
and saying that I was evil

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:50.960
and that I was going to burn in hell

01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:52.000
for my sexual orientation.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.280
So now we've got it from both sides.

01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:54.000
So great.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:54.720
Thanks for that.

01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:56.720
I mean, that's what the woke have done.

01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:59.280
They, you know, it's not, and that's why...

01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:00.800
Yeah, and that isn't over yet.

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:02.000
You know, that isn't over yet.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.400
That's going to get a lot worse before it gets better.

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:06.320
And God only knows how it's going to shake out.

01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:09.280
I mean, this year's Pride celebration

01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:11.360
was a whole new set of...

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:13.120
Well, people are getting sick of it.

01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:14.240
Yes, yes, yes.

01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:15.520
Well, no bloody wonder.

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:16.800
A month, really?

01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:17.600
Yeah.

01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:19.040
Good God, guys.

01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:20.800
Partly because it's become so corporate.

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:23.520
You know, corporations put their flags up.

01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:24.720
They don't put it up in the Middle East

01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:26.960
or in Saudi Arabia or places like that,

01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:28.960
where it might actually make a difference, by the way,

01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:31.440
flying that flag, where gay people are killed for being gay.

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:33.040
No, they don't do that.

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:34.400
But they put it up here.

01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:38.320
They never did this, by the way, before gay marriage,

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:40.400
before the age of consent was equalized.

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:41.200
They didn't do any of that.

01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:44.640
They're doing it now because corporations

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:46.800
are so in lockstep with the woke ideology,

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:48.000
which is another reason, by the way,

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.920
if you want to go back to this left-right distinction,

01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:51.600
why I think this is so unhelpful,

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:52.320
because it's a movement...

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:53.280
Right, right, I agree.

01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:53.920
I agree.

01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:56.000
Well, and I don't think there's any worse woke

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.600
than woke capitalism.

01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:57.840
No, no.

01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:00.640
That's the bastard child of greed and ideology, man.

01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:00.880
I mean, that's...

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:02.080
It's some sort of monster.

01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:03.680
Well, that is right-wing wokeness.

01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:06.160
It can't be anything but because capitalism is a set...

01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:08.640
You know, these are essentially money-making bodies.

01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:09.440
These are not...

01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:12.400
These are not socialist organizations.

01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:13.360
It's...

01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:14.720
So there is a confusion there.

01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:16.000
And also, by the way,

01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:19.840
the woke always side against the workers.

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:20.880
You know, whenever these...

01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:21.440
I know.

01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:22.080
That's so in...

01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:22.720
And the poor.

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:23.280
And the poor.

01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:24.320
And the poor, so...

01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:24.880
I know.

01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:26.320
That's so interesting, too,

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:28.400
because I've watched the radicals,

01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:30.800
especially in Europe over the last five years,

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:31.680
because I was curious.

01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:34.000
It's like, well, when push comes to shove,

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.840
let's say, on the climate front,

01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:38.960
are they going to sacrifice the poor on the altar of woke?

01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:41.280
And the answer is, in a bloody heartbeat,

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:42.320
in a second, no holds forward.

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:44.000
That's what net zero does.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.520
Net zero is precisely that.

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:46.960
It's the poor, the better-brun.

01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:47.760
But that's why I don't think...

01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:48.960
Absolutely.

01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:50.800
And whereas I'm probably wrong to say

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:54.080
the wokeness is closer to the right or whatever that is,

01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:55.680
it's definitely not a left-wing movement

01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:56.800
in any traditional understanding

01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:57.760
of what left-wing means.

01:35:57.760 --> 01:35:58.640
It can't be.

01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:00.240
No, I think we have to stop thinking

01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:01.440
about it politically altogether.

01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:01.600
Exactly, exactly.

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:02.720
I think, fundamentally,

01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:04.720
the religious analysis is the right one.

01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:06.480
But that's a weird one, Andrew.

01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:08.400
That's going to take us some strange places,

01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:10.160
because if this is actually...

01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:12.000
First of all, we're actually making the claim

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.240
that this is a spiritual battle, right?

01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:15.520
A religious battle.

01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:18.400
And that's a hell of a claim to make, you know?

01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:20.320
Especially for somebody who's more tilted

01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:21.440
towards atheism.

01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:23.040
And I don't even know what the hell it means

01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:24.160
to make that claim.

01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:27.040
But I don't think it is a political struggle, fundamentally.

01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:27.680
That's right.

01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:30.960
And to bring that into the LGBTQ stuff,

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:33.200
the way that sex education appears

01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:34.560
to be run at the moment,

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:36.160
I don't know how it is necessarily where you are,

01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:39.280
but in Wales, definitely, in Scotland, definitely,

01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:40.880
and in England, we are having similar problems,

01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:44.640
you have gender ideologues writing the curriculum,

01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:45.200
effectively.

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:45.600
Yeah, yeah.

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:46.960
So children are being told.

01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:49.040
Even worse, Canada, after all.

01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:50.320
Oh, yeah, of course, of course.

01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:51.760
Think of this country.

01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:53.760
I mean, we've got narcissistic...

01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:55.680
We've got, what would we say?

01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:59.280
We've got the cardinal narcissist running our country.

01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:01.920
He's everything woke you could possibly imagine.

01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:04.000
And he's got that psychopathic charm

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.280
that lends itself to fooling gullible women.

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:09.040
It's a perfect bloody storm.

01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:13.040
I don't see any difference between effectively encouraging teachers

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:18.080
to promote gender identity ideology to young children

01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:22.560
as having some kind of hook-handed Islamic cleric come in

01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:24.720
and say gay people should be burned to death.

01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:26.160
I don't really see the difference there.

01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:32.560
And so far as you're promoting a really reactionary belief system

01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:35.280
on to children when it comes to the realm of sex and sexuality.

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:37.360
And I think that's really, really dangerous.

01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:39.440
So unless we grapple with this point,

01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:42.400
or unless we as a general population grapple with the fact

01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:46.000
that sex education now is really a religious preaching,

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:46.720
that's all it is.

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:50.320
You were talking about where do you stop?

01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:52.320
How much do you teach them about what?

01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:53.760
Actually, kids generally learn

01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:55.440
and figure things out for themselves, don't they?

01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:57.920
So I've always been of the view that sex education

01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:59.120
doesn't need to be as...

01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:01.280
I think people need to know the basics.

01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:04.400
But I think there's far too much of it going on.

01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:05.840
But we've reached the point where,

01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:08.160
I mean, you must have heard this audio recording

01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:10.960
that was leaked this week from a school in England,

01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:12.640
a place called Rye College.

01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:17.200
The teacher was recorded berating two 13-year-old girls

01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:18.560
because they would not accept

01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:20.960
that one of their peers identified as a cat.

01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:21.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:23.440
And look, it looks silly.

01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:24.720
Well, it's pretty rude, you know.

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:26.000
It is.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.560
To not let the poor girl wear a tail and all that.

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:31.280
Well, you know, this is the thing.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.480
There was a report in the Telegraph this week as well

01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:37.680
saying that there's a school where one child identifies

01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:38.800
as a horse.

01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:40.560
There's one who identifies as a dinosaur.

01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:42.080
There's one who, quite creatively,

01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:45.040
identifies as a moon and wears a cape.

01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:46.480
Now, I think what's happening there

01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:48.560
is those kids are being satirical.

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:50.080
They're... What they're seeing is...

01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:51.120
God, I hope so.

01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:51.600
No, I think they are.

01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:52.240
Go, kids, go.

01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:54.240
You know, the kids that are saying,

01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:56.400
I'm a cat and I need to lie down

01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:58.480
and I need to be stroked and I need to meow.

01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:01.280
Look, they have seen that the figures of authority,

01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:04.240
the teachers, are totally capitulating

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:06.240
to this bizarre belief system,

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:09.440
this esoteric cult, and unless...

01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:10.800
I would have done that in a heartbeat

01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:11.440
when I was 30.

01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:12.080
I would have.

01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:14.480
As a kid, I would have said,

01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:16.400
I'm a velociraptor and you know,

01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:17.760
you have to, you know, and you do what I say

01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:18.880
or I'll eat you or whatever.

01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:21.200
I don't care what it is, but they...

01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:22.160
These kids are pushy.

01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:23.520
They always test the limits anyway.

01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:25.520
But what's brilliant about this is

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:28.720
the teachers can't do anything about it.

01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:32.320
If a young child decides he's a moon

01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:33.600
and wears a cape and a teacher says,

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:34.400
no, you're not,

01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:35.840
she's denying the sacred creed

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:37.360
of gender identity ideology,

01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:38.960
which is in the national curriculum now.

01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:41.440
So she'll get fired.

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:44.560
So this puts the kids in an incredible position of power.

01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:45.840
They're having fun with it.

01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:50.160
And this is also why I'm slightly heartened by this,

01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:51.440
because I kind of think the kids

01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:53.280
are going to be our way out of this.

01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:56.560
I think I hope that this mad religious fervor

01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:58.160
will burn out because the kids see it

01:39:58.160 --> 01:39:59.280
for what it is.

01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:00.400
You know, the fact that that woman

01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:01.760
in that recording was saying that these girls,

01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:03.520
well, I think she said they were despicable.

01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:04.640
I think that was the word she used,

01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:07.920
despicable for not validating

01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:10.800
or accepting their friend's identity as a cat.

01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:14.240
I mean, that's such an extreme position

01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:15.520
for a teacher to take.

01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:16.320
I also don't, by the way,

01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:19.520
I don't think it's fair to dog pile her and bombard.

01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:22.960
And I saw someone doxing her, putting her face.

01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:24.320
And look, she's just following,

01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:26.640
she's probably not a very intelligent person.

01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:27.920
She's probably not a very thinking person.

01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:29.920
But she's just following what she's told to say.

01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:32.640
She's been told by all of the teacher training colleges,

01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:34.080
all of the academics in education

01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:35.600
that this is the case and you've got to go with it.

01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:37.200
And she's just doing her job.

01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:38.720
So I think that's unfair as well.

01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:40.960
I would like teachers to be more intelligent

01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:42.960
and creative and to challenge this stuff.

01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:45.120
But, you know, that's not happening.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:46.960
So yeah, maybe it may be...

01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:49.840
I guess we're learning why the eternal serpent

01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:51.680
always devours its own tail, right?

01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:52.160
Right.

01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:54.240
It's so interesting to see these things

01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:57.200
push too far, start to eat themselves.

01:40:57.200 --> 01:40:58.480
You know, it's...

01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:00.560
We're living in the strangest times, man.

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:01.360
That might be it.

01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:02.560
That might be the hope, though, right?

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:05.360
So it's an optimistic point to make.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.680
But ultimately, because I think this ideology

01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:12.480
is not sustainable, because it is too full of...

01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:15.520
We did walk ourselves back from the brink of tyranny

01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:17.280
on the COVID lockdown front, right?

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:18.240
I mean, we were...

01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:20.480
We went full totalitarian for two years,

01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:22.080
but then everybody seemed to decide

01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:24.080
maybe that wasn't such a good idea.

01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:25.520
But that's quite instructive, isn't it?

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:27.200
The way that we now talk about it.

01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:28.720
Everyone sort of...

01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:30.000
No one mentions it now, do they?

01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:34.560
You walk around, very few people wearing masks.

01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:36.800
People have just sort of...

01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:38.080
There came a weird turning point

01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:39.520
where everyone just decided,

01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:42.400
actually, it's a virus with a very low mortality rate.

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:43.600
Let's just not worry about it.

01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:44.800
And that just sort of happened.

01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:48.880
People have forgotten the mania, the extreme mania.

01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:50.560
People screaming at each other on the streets

01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:53.760
if they weren't wearing masks and the extreme policies.

01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:56.560
The Canadian government's reaction

01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:58.560
to the truckers who were worried

01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:00.160
about their livelihood due to lockdown.

01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:02.160
You mean stealing their bank accounts?

01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:03.760
Stealing their bank accounts

01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:05.520
and threatening to give them money

01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:07.440
to other charities or something?

01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:08.640
Didn't they even...

01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:09.360
I mean, you'll know.

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:10.080
Yeah, yeah, Go said...

01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:14.160
So $10 million was raised on GoFundMe.

01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:14.960
That's it, yeah.

01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:17.920
And then GoFundMe decided

01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:20.080
they weren't going to distribute it to the truckers.

01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:22.880
Then they decided, instead of refunding it,

01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:24.480
they were going to distribute it

01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:26.480
to a charity of their choice.

01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:28.960
Then Ron DeSantis said,

01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:31.840
I think you better not do that or else.

01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:33.840
And then they decided they would refund it.

01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:36.160
And now the money that hasn't been refunded

01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:38.640
is in escrow and there's a huge fight in Canada

01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:39.760
about who owns it.

01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:41.840
We haven't settled the trucker mess here at all.

01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:43.840
But the trucker convoy,

01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:45.360
it had something to do with everybody

01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:46.960
taking those goddamn masks off.

01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:47.600
I'm sure.

01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:50.480
I wonder how those politicians

01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:52.000
who were involved in this will feel about this

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.200
in 20 years' time.

01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:56.320
I know one of your politicians claimed

01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:58.800
that the truckers were beeping their horns

01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:01.120
because they were dog whistling to fascists

01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:03.920
because the honk honk is HH

01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:05.360
and that means Heil Hitler.

01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:06.960
I mean, that was something that was seriously said by...

01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:08.560
Well, that's common knowledge here in Andrew.

01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:09.680
Everybody who honks their horn

01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:11.520
is actually secretly admiring Hitler,

01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:12.800
especially if they do it twice.

01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:14.800
That is so insane.

01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:17.440
So I wonder whether...

01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:19.840
That's Salem which trial level is insane.

01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:20.320
Exactly.

01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:22.400
And Salem is a good example, right?

01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:23.520
Because, you know,

01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:25.040
there's a reason I've used it in the book

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:28.240
is that I think it gives us our clues to our way out.

01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:30.640
Because Salem happened so quickly,

01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:32.880
it happened within just over a year, right?

01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:33.840
Late 17th century,

01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:37.200
this hysteria emerged from nowhere

01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:39.440
and fizzled out immediately

01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:41.520
and everyone afterwards repented.

01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:44.480
All of the people who were most involved in it said,

01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:45.360
we got that wrong.

01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:46.800
What happened there?

01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:48.240
We went mad for a while there

01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:49.520
because they weren't...

01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:55.600
Well, this is maybe the first widespread mental illness

01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:58.400
afflicting our new electronic nervous system.

01:43:58.400 --> 01:43:58.960
That's it.

01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:01.920
I think this is a hysteria on a global scale,

01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:05.760
akin to what happened in Salem.

01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:12.000
I think it's perpetuated itself by a similar means,

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.440
which is firstly just the mechanism of hysteria,

01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:16.720
which I'm not qualified to talk about,

01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:20.400
but also the fact that people in authority

01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:22.880
go along with it because they're terrified not to.

01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:24.400
You know, because in Salem,

01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:26.320
anyone said, hang on, I don't think this is right,

01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:28.160
they were the next to be executed.

01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:29.600
So you don't have politicians saying,

01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:33.440
hang on a minute, is it possible for human beings to change sex?

01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:34.880
Do I know what a woman is?

01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:36.080
They all know the answer,

01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:37.920
just as the magistrates in Salem

01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:39.600
knew that the girls weren't seeing the devil.

01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:42.720
But it all fizzled out very, very quickly.

01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:44.720
One of the points I make in the book

01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:48.160
is about that all of the prosecutions were secured

01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:50.400
on this thing called spectral evidence.

01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:52.480
In other words, the girls' experience,

01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:53.840
what we call lived experience.

01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:56.320
The girls believed that they were seeing devils,

01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:58.800
and therefore that was taken as evidence.

01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:00.960
And that's why the cases collapsed,

01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:04.160
because at the end, the deputy governor of Massachusetts

01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:06.480
wrote to the leading clergyman in the country and said,

01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:10.000
can spectral evidence be admissible in court?

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.320
And they all said, no, of course not.

01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:13.760
The whole thing disappeared overnight.

01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:15.200
Everyone denied they had any part in it.

01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:16.880
These weren't witch hunters.

01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:18.400
They didn't go around hunting witches.

01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:19.440
That happened a lot in Europe.

01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:20.880
It didn't happen in New England.

01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:21.280
And so they were good people.

01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:24.880
Maybe that's the least stupid pathway forward for us now.

01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:27.440
And maybe, God willing, that's the one we'll take.

01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:29.440
We should stop, I guess, I don't want to,

01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:31.120
because you're very entertaining to talk to.

01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:33.440
For everybody watching and listening,

01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:35.680
I'm going to talk to Andrew for another half an hour.

01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:38.480
On the Daily Wire Plus platform side,

01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:40.080
a little bit more personally,

01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:42.160
I want to see a bit more about what makes them tick.

01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:43.440
And so if you're interested in that,

01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:45.360
head over to the Daily Wire Plus platform.

01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:47.440
You could throw those characters,

01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:50.640
those reprehensible right-wing bastards a penny or two,

01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:55.200
if you're inclined to, because they are heading the fight

01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:56.480
to support free speech.

01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:58.880
In the US, the YouTube has been after us,

01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:01.040
because I'm allied with the Daily Wire types,

01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:03.760
been after us pretty badly in the last month.

01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:06.160
They took down three of my talks,

01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:07.520
including one with Helen Joyce,

01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:10.240
because you know how reprehensible good old Helen,

01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:12.080
the Economist journalist is.

01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:15.120
And they also took down a talk I had with Robert F. Kennedy,

01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:18.480
despite the fact that he's running for president.

01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:20.000
And so that's YouTube,

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.320
and they're definitely going after all the Daily Wire folks.

01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:24.720
So thank you all for your time and attention,

01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:26.160
and to Andrew for talking to me

01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:28.000
and helping me delve into these things,

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.480
get a little bit more clarity along with everyone else.

01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:32.960
And for everyone watching and listening,

01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:33.760
we'll see you soon.

01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:36.640
And to the Daily Wire folks, thanks for your support.

01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:39.200
Andrew, off to the Daily Wire.

01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:40.800
Thank you very much.
