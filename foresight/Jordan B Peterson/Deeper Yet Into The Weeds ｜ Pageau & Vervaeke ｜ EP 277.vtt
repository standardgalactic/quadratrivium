WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.040
One of the things I really found striking about Tammy is like she did a very detailed picture of my daughter's surgical wound

00:07.040 --> 00:11.840
And that's not an easy thing to look at right because you don't want to look at that

00:11.840 --> 00:15.320
But that also ties in with the ideas we've been discussing about well

00:15.320 --> 00:19.120
I think that's the with the mystery. Yes mystery of the crucifix. You bet right

00:19.120 --> 00:24.760
Yeah, all these images that we have like the beauty of Christ wounds all these things which sound so completely

00:25.920 --> 00:29.240
Pathological yeah to many people if you can understand them properly

00:29.240 --> 00:32.320
You can understand that that you have to gaze on that which most threatens

00:45.280 --> 00:51.040
So, hello everyone, I'm pleased here pleased today to have with me

00:52.120 --> 00:54.120
Jonathan Pazio and John Verveke

00:55.120 --> 00:59.600
People that most of you many of you not all of you will be familiar with I

01:01.680 --> 01:03.680
I've been working on a new book

01:04.200 --> 01:08.400
entitled we who wrestle with God and it's been influenced by

01:09.400 --> 01:11.400
Jonathan's ideas and

01:11.560 --> 01:13.560
John's ideas and I

01:14.160 --> 01:21.960
Developed an argument in part as a consequence of the public lectures. I've been doing for the last three months trying to push my ideas farther and I

01:22.800 --> 01:24.240
I I

01:24.240 --> 01:26.240
Put forward a set of

01:26.480 --> 01:33.160
Propositions that I'm basing one of the book chapters on I wrote it as an outline and then I think it's solid

01:33.160 --> 01:39.280
I've been testing it when I've been speaking at universities as well to diverse audiences of specialists

01:39.280 --> 01:43.820
To see if they'll object to it because I think it's actually quite radical and I sent this group of

01:44.840 --> 01:51.360
Propositions or this list of propositions to Jonathan and John a month ago about and we've been going back and forth

01:51.960 --> 01:56.760
And I thought I heard Jonathan was coming to town to do a talk with John and I thought hey

01:56.760 --> 01:58.760
that's a good opportunity we could get together and

01:59.200 --> 02:05.320
Walk through these propositions because I'd like to see if if they're solid because if they're solid

02:05.600 --> 02:06.520
Well, that's good

02:06.520 --> 02:10.440
And if they're not I'd like to find out and so we're gonna do this a little different

02:10.720 --> 02:13.200
This is gonna be a little different than many of the conversations

02:13.200 --> 02:17.800
I've had because it'll have a bit more structure and I I want to read the propositions

02:17.800 --> 02:23.520
There's I think about 15 of them and I want Jonathan and and John to

02:25.280 --> 02:27.360
Comment on them to

02:27.360 --> 02:29.640
Tell me where they agree to tell me where they disagree

02:30.040 --> 02:35.400
Tell me what they don't understand and to see if I can well learn something as a consequence

02:35.400 --> 02:39.600
That's kind of the whole and so we'll start with this first proposition

02:41.680 --> 02:43.680
To see the world

02:43.920 --> 02:45.920
We must must

02:46.920 --> 02:48.920
Prioritize our perceptions

02:49.880 --> 02:51.280
so

02:51.280 --> 02:58.000
John I'll ask you about that first because that's a particular I believe a particular focus of yours

02:58.000 --> 03:02.960
I don't think that's an exaggeration. No, it's not. That's that's that's the core of my work

03:04.040 --> 03:05.680
and so

03:05.680 --> 03:07.680
the main

03:07.880 --> 03:10.640
Way I would respond to this is I would say

03:11.120 --> 03:16.720
I think the work that's coming out from artificial intelligence and the work that's coming out from attention

03:17.280 --> 03:22.640
Lines up with this very well. I don't have any significant disagreement with that proposition

03:22.640 --> 03:24.840
And and the must part of it as well

03:26.360 --> 03:30.280
So the must I took well, let me tell you how I took yes, yeah

03:30.280 --> 03:33.680
And I took it as what's called constitutive necessity

03:33.680 --> 03:37.000
I took it to be if you are going to be a cognitive agent

03:37.480 --> 03:40.600
Then you must do this. I didn't take it to be a metaphysical

03:41.360 --> 03:43.960
Necessity I took it to be that kind of constituent necessity

03:43.960 --> 03:50.440
I think it's useful to start with what you described as constituent necessities before you move into the realm of metaphysical

03:50.440 --> 03:56.680
Exactly, I think that's a good way to argue you should all right and so I think and I'm not going to

03:58.600 --> 04:02.800
Recapitulate all these arguments, but a lot of work. I think zero is in on the idea

04:03.680 --> 04:10.280
That the core of what makes us intelligent and the thing that we're finding difficult to give to machines to make them

04:10.760 --> 04:18.200
Artificially general intelligence is a process. I call relevance realization, which is exactly I think lines up with this very well

04:18.280 --> 04:25.080
The amount of information available to you in the world is astronomically vast all the things you could pay attention to

04:25.440 --> 04:27.640
The amount of information in your long-term memory

04:27.760 --> 04:31.680
Especially if you think of all the ways it could be combined is also

04:31.840 --> 04:37.600
Astronomically the number of options of potential lines of behavior. I could move this finger this finger

04:37.600 --> 04:41.560
I could move them like a lift like you and the ways I can move around that's combinatorial

04:41.560 --> 04:45.560
Explosion all of it all of it and then right and then you can also consider

04:45.640 --> 04:50.520
You know all of the options of different pit of potential worlds

04:50.520 --> 04:57.440
You might want to consider trying to produce or moving into right and so the point is in many different dimensions

04:57.640 --> 05:00.520
We face combinatorial explosion and what's

05:01.720 --> 05:06.720
What you can't do and this is where it lines up with the most because we're finite beings

05:06.720 --> 05:10.640
Yes, the finite resources and finite time is you can't check all of that information

05:10.640 --> 05:15.280
So you can't go and say no, that's not relevant. That's not relevant that memory is not relevant

05:15.280 --> 05:22.000
That will take like that's the the rest of the history of the universe right right, so so we don't know how we do it

05:22.000 --> 05:24.480
In fact because of that in part. Well, I mean, I think

05:25.200 --> 05:30.640
I think there's getting some clues towards it, but we can talk about that later. Okay, right?

05:30.640 --> 05:36.920
So the must and the prioritization on the perception side you're fine with it has to be it has to be and here

05:36.920 --> 05:39.420
But here's the tricky thing which is

05:40.720 --> 05:47.280
The fact that we can't check it means and this sounds almost like a Zen coin is the prioritization is odd

05:47.920 --> 05:50.160
when you say it sort of like

05:50.760 --> 05:55.200
Primaficia, yeah, because it means we intelligently ignore

05:56.000 --> 06:01.040
Most of the information right prioritizing the what I want to put yeah, that's a good codicilies

06:01.040 --> 06:08.360
So you're saying that you don't want to misinterpret the necessity for prioritization as our as something like

06:08.920 --> 06:15.960
The necessity or our ability to make a numbered list of exactly number of possibilities that lay out in front of us

06:15.960 --> 06:22.840
Because that's actually impossible right so so that isn't how we do it. However, we do it isn't that exactly so when you when when if

06:23.080 --> 06:25.800
If you're okay with that reading and it sounds like you are

06:26.600 --> 06:31.760
Prioritization doesn't mean what we normally mean by prioritization where we set things out

06:32.440 --> 06:40.760
Explicit and focal and then choose right great. It's implicit. It's implicit and it's self-organizing and our ability to think and it's unconscious

06:40.760 --> 06:42.280
Yes emerges out of it

06:42.680 --> 06:49.080
We can influence it top down but because it is an absolute requirement for our cognition

06:49.560 --> 06:55.320
I would argue that our ability to do anything that we do consciously is ultimately dependent on it and right

06:56.040 --> 07:00.680
Okay, fine. So that's good Jonathan. Well, I think the only thing that I would add is

07:01.720 --> 07:05.240
You have to phrase it in a certain way. There's no you have to have a sense

07:05.720 --> 07:07.720
But there's a sense in with perception

07:07.960 --> 07:10.280
When we say we must prioritize our perceptions

07:10.360 --> 07:14.600
I I think the best way to understand is that perception is already prioritization

07:14.920 --> 07:16.920
It is to in order to perceive

07:16.920 --> 07:21.320
That has to be a hierarchy in itself the perception is in and of itself

07:22.360 --> 07:24.360
it an act of

07:24.600 --> 07:26.600
Implicit prioritization

07:26.600 --> 07:28.200
And to use the word implicit will be a good idea

07:28.200 --> 07:33.640
So to avoid the idea that we are consciously doing it that in order to even perceive the world there already has to be

07:34.440 --> 07:36.440
a given hierarchy that is

07:36.600 --> 07:43.160
That is making you able to focus on anything because yeah, or else we would be lost in a in a way as you know

07:43.240 --> 07:45.240
A sea of infinite details

07:45.240 --> 07:50.600
Okay, so I think that's a good cortisol. And so we could also make a little technical case here quickly

07:51.320 --> 07:54.360
So part of the problem that John John referred to is that

07:54.920 --> 07:58.040
In some sense, it's the problem of the finite confronting the infinite

07:58.120 --> 08:00.760
And so we could make a neurological argument for that

08:00.760 --> 08:07.560
So for example when you move your eyes around or when they move around as a consequence of being directed by unconscious

08:08.200 --> 08:10.840
Structures of prioritization because that happens all the time

08:12.360 --> 08:19.080
You move your eyes around because you want to direct the high resolution part of your visual system to whatever you're attending to

08:19.560 --> 08:23.720
That's the fovea and the fovea is a very small part of your retina and

08:24.600 --> 08:26.360
It's a very high resolution part

08:26.360 --> 08:31.080
So each cell in the fovea is connected at the level of the primary visual cortex

08:31.560 --> 08:35.560
To 10,000 cells and then each of those have 10,000 connections

08:35.880 --> 08:39.960
And so if your whole vision was foveal in its

08:40.600 --> 08:45.800
Um in its resolution you'd have to have a skull like an alien to contain that much brain

08:45.880 --> 08:51.080
And so so so and that's a real indication of that finitude right is that you do have

08:51.640 --> 08:54.040
limited cognitive resources and limited means

08:54.680 --> 08:57.240
Practically and physically limited, but it also means

08:58.120 --> 09:02.280
Metabolically limited the the cost of running your brain is already extremely high

09:02.840 --> 09:04.040
and

09:04.040 --> 09:06.760
And so you're going to shepherd your available

09:07.560 --> 09:13.960
attentional resources because they are finite and and they're finite in no small part because they are technically

09:14.840 --> 09:16.360
metabolically

09:16.360 --> 09:18.840
Costly that all seems okay

09:19.720 --> 09:25.400
So I would add one thing to that which is I would put an emphasis on how this process has to be self-organizing

09:25.720 --> 09:27.720
because we want to avoid

09:27.800 --> 09:31.080
A perennial problem, which you and I both know shows up in psychology

09:31.320 --> 09:33.320
Which is to posit the internal homunculus

09:33.720 --> 09:39.320
That actually doesn't explain the problem, but just shifts the central executive is an example of this etc

09:39.560 --> 09:46.840
So we don't we we don't want to say that there's someone that's doing the prioritization because that someone is just as mysterious

09:46.920 --> 09:53.640
Right and is facing the very problem that we're trying to explain. So yeah, right the process has to be dynamically so far

09:53.880 --> 09:55.880
Well, one of the ways I

09:56.680 --> 09:58.440
realized

09:58.440 --> 10:04.600
How that problem works is in an attempt to solve the mind-body problem because you can't solve the mind-body problem

10:05.080 --> 10:08.280
But you can say let's say you're you want to

10:09.000 --> 10:11.800
Explore an idea and you decide to do that by writing an essay

10:12.040 --> 10:15.560
So then you sit down in front of the computer, which is not an idea

10:15.800 --> 10:19.400
It's actually that you're sitting and then you move your fingers on the keyboard

10:19.480 --> 10:25.640
And so there's a hierarchy of transformation from mind which might be the abstract intent to body

10:25.960 --> 10:29.880
And so and so that the spirit hits the body in the finger movements

10:30.200 --> 10:36.280
And then the spirit disappears in some sense under the finger movements because you can move your fingers voluntarily

10:36.440 --> 10:41.720
But you have no idea what muscles you're moving to do that and you can't control the cells or anything like that

10:41.880 --> 10:45.800
Oh, I did that with my students in the lecture this morning. I was talking about

10:46.600 --> 10:49.160
This very fact that I said, uh, put up your finger

10:49.880 --> 10:55.560
Okay, bend your finger. What do you do to bend your finger? Right exactly. Exactly. It's so interesting

10:56.280 --> 11:01.960
It's so interesting that you have that level of consciousness at that level of detail, which is pretty detailed

11:02.200 --> 11:08.680
But no more than that. Yes. Yes. Yeah. So that's a mystery man that that that that localization of consciousness

11:09.640 --> 11:14.040
Between the body and part of the spirit. There's like a there's like a what would you call it? Uh

11:14.600 --> 11:18.360
There's a bandwidth. There's a bandwidth of resolution for consciousness. Yes

11:18.440 --> 11:25.640
And why that band see the social psychologists who studied language are caught into this because one of the things they realized was that

11:26.200 --> 11:29.320
Short words first of all short words tend to be old words

11:29.960 --> 11:33.880
So because as language develops words that are used a lot get more efficient

11:34.440 --> 11:40.760
But the short words also map extraordinarily well onto the self evident level of perception

11:41.160 --> 11:44.280
and so for example a short word is cat because

11:46.120 --> 11:48.120
A cat presents itself

11:48.120 --> 11:52.520
For some reason to our perception the species cat doesn't and the

11:53.080 --> 11:57.640
The fur of the cat in some sense doesn't it's the cat. Yes, and and you can see that

11:58.440 --> 12:05.320
Primary object record level recognition basic level basic level. That's right. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. And so you see that with

12:05.800 --> 12:07.800
Babies because they get

12:07.960 --> 12:15.480
Doggy pretty damn fast and that that's because the language maps on to the primary domain of perception that basic level perception

12:15.800 --> 12:19.240
Quite nicely and that is associated with something like the natural

12:19.880 --> 12:26.840
Bandwidth of consciousness. Yeah, I would I would say that that lines up with if you rush his explanation

12:27.480 --> 12:33.640
Is you know, you're getting the best trade-off between differences between category and similarities within categories, right?

12:33.640 --> 12:41.320
And then the question is what this best trade-off means exactly and that's and for me that's that's what that would that be a little bit of

12:42.760 --> 12:44.760
I guess a nuance I'd want to put on to

12:45.480 --> 12:48.360
The prioritization because the prioritization sounds

12:49.080 --> 12:51.400
very but sort of like an imposition

12:52.280 --> 12:57.720
Whereas I think what we're talking about is something more like what maro ponte talked about when he talked about optimal gripping

12:58.280 --> 13:00.520
Right. So what's what's the correct?

13:01.640 --> 13:03.320
You know distance to look at this

13:03.320 --> 13:08.680
Well, it depends because if I zoom in I lose the gestalt if I zoom out I lose the detail that depends on what you want to do

13:08.840 --> 13:12.840
Exactly. Well, that's it. That's why I'm kind of attracted to pragmatism

13:12.840 --> 13:18.040
It's like well to some degree our theories of truth need to be embedded in the practicalities of action

13:18.120 --> 13:24.280
And so is that a grippable object that I can drink from while I want my perception to match that problem

13:25.160 --> 13:28.920
Yeah, but it doesn't I think that it if you understand that the prioritization

13:29.720 --> 13:33.560
The thing that you have heaven and earth. I'm going to use sorry. I'm going to use mythical categories. But so you have

13:35.480 --> 13:37.480
You have heaven and earth and that

13:37.960 --> 13:42.040
It's the way in which heaven meets earth is a it's a mutual relationship, right?

13:42.040 --> 13:44.680
We always see it as a relationship of lovers you could say

13:44.920 --> 13:48.520
But it's not the the prioritization isn't just about an imposition from above

13:48.520 --> 13:51.640
But it's about the manner in which that which is above let's say the

13:52.200 --> 13:58.200
The hierarchy is able to encounter the potential on which it's we were talking about that last night

13:58.280 --> 14:02.680
So jonathan made this funny joke last night. We were talking about sam harris and sam harris has this

14:03.640 --> 14:05.640
Uh line of argumentation

14:05.880 --> 14:11.000
Where and he used this on me where I interpreted a biblical story and then he interpreted a recipe

14:11.160 --> 14:14.600
Yes, and he said well look at all the interpretations and that is a problem of

14:15.240 --> 14:22.200
Of semiotic drift. Yes. Well, it's also a problem of this horizon of infinite possibility. There are multiple interpretive schemes

14:22.600 --> 14:24.600
So jonathan said he'd like to do a video

14:25.160 --> 14:29.800
Where he shows that a recipe is actually necessarily embedded inside a mythological framework

14:29.800 --> 14:31.960
And we started to talk about that because imagine

14:32.440 --> 14:34.440
Well, the recipe implies

14:34.760 --> 14:40.680
That you need to make an edible meal that you want to make an edible meal that you're going to serve it to family

14:40.680 --> 14:44.520
And friends that that's part of a kind of communion that you think that's a good thing

14:44.600 --> 14:47.880
That's worth spending time on that serves your family and friends

14:48.120 --> 14:51.800
That's maybe nested in something like an ethic of service to the community

14:51.800 --> 14:54.440
Like there's a whole there's a whole network of purpose

14:54.520 --> 14:56.120
I would add more to that

14:56.120 --> 15:00.680
There's all kinds of implicit assumptions that I can capture in a sequence of propositions

15:01.240 --> 15:07.560
Procedural skills that are not completely capturable in words and that those procedures and skills can also map on

15:07.880 --> 15:09.880
Through the particular virtues and skill

15:10.120 --> 15:12.280
You know that that people are bringing to like

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
it's like

15:15.320 --> 15:21.400
Most things can't be solved by a recipe and right right and yet so a recipe is a

15:22.200 --> 15:26.600
significant cognitive cultural achievement and we don't recognize like and and and

15:27.400 --> 15:33.320
We we we we tend to over generalize the things we think for which we can provide recipes. This is one of the right

15:33.480 --> 15:37.480
That's an algorithm issue. Yes, exactly. Exactly. And so there's lots

15:37.880 --> 15:39.880
Yeah, even in the recipe itself

15:39.960 --> 15:45.160
You will notice that the way in which we name things and the way in which we order things will be related to a normal

15:45.480 --> 15:47.240
prioritization hierarchy prioritization

15:47.320 --> 15:51.320
But if you're making chicken you'll have the chicken and then you'll have the spices

15:51.480 --> 15:55.320
And you'll understand that these elements that i'm adding are spices and that they're there

15:55.480 --> 15:59.080
Let's say something like a marginalia that i'm adding to the central meal

15:59.240 --> 16:02.920
It's actually the very it's like it's the pattern of a church actually, you know where you have

16:03.400 --> 16:06.600
A movement towards the central identity that we understand and then we have

16:07.240 --> 16:12.600
The way in which it's complemented to other things and so even the actual recipe itself is like a little

16:12.920 --> 16:17.320
Microphone and also the judgment you use is like well, how much spice well the answer is

16:17.880 --> 16:20.360
Well, what function is this spice going to serve and you say well

16:20.360 --> 16:23.080
I want to add a little zest and interest

16:23.400 --> 16:28.200
To my cooking and so then you have a philosophy of zest and interest that's associated with that because

16:28.600 --> 16:30.440
Just predictable chicken isn't good enough

16:30.440 --> 16:35.000
And maybe you want to put a little more spice on because you want to uh, what would you say you want to

16:35.720 --> 16:40.600
Challenge your guests a little bit in an interesting way and you're thinking this all through and for the same reason

16:40.600 --> 16:44.440
You'd wear funny socks or a tie that has just a little bit too much on it, you know

16:44.920 --> 16:48.600
Well, it seems I mean that's actually the future of general problem solving

16:48.920 --> 16:54.360
Like you when people are solving a problem, especially if they might get the wrong frame

16:54.840 --> 16:59.960
Moderately distracting you from the central concern is an optimal way. Yeah, exactly. You need to do that

17:00.040 --> 17:06.840
So so what I'm hearing both of you say is the prioritization is really a multi-dimensional optimal gripping

17:07.320 --> 17:12.920
That's right. That's right. We're concentrating on okay. Well, then that we can also expand on that to some degree because

17:13.720 --> 17:15.720
multi-dimensional and optimal

17:16.200 --> 17:21.960
Brings a lot of other concerns into it. So imagine that one of the principles and and can't can't

17:23.640 --> 17:28.040
Move towards this with this theory of universal ethic in some sense, although I think it

17:28.760 --> 17:30.840
You know I hesitate to criticize can't because but

17:32.280 --> 17:37.080
I think that there's a deeper explanation for what he observes is well, how should I treat you?

17:37.640 --> 17:41.880
Well, that's a complex question. But one of the constraints is well

17:42.920 --> 17:44.920
What if we meet a hundred times?

17:45.400 --> 17:50.600
So we're going to establish an actual relationship. So however, I conduct myself in the present moment

17:51.400 --> 17:52.520
has to

17:52.600 --> 17:57.640
Be in accordance with a value hierarchy that takes into account the desirability of our mutual

17:58.600 --> 18:03.160
Interrelationship into the future and that produces a very serious series of I would say

18:03.720 --> 18:08.440
Often intrinsic constraints. So I can't be too insulting. I can't be too unwelcoming

18:08.440 --> 18:13.960
I have to offer you something approximating a true reciprocity for the thing not to degenerate

18:14.440 --> 18:19.560
And so and all of that and I would say that also governs how you cook for someone if you actually want to make friends

18:19.960 --> 18:23.160
So it's like treat other people as you would like them to treat you

18:23.560 --> 18:29.720
And it's pretty funny that that's the intrinsic ethic in a recipe. And so that's a good that's a that's such a funny argument

18:30.760 --> 18:34.120
We'll get right back to Jonathan Peugeot and John Verbecki in just a moment

18:34.440 --> 18:42.760
First we'd like to tell you about Elysium health founded by Dr. Leonard Garante a renowned mit researcher and 30 year student of the science of aging

18:42.920 --> 18:49.240
Elysium health is on a mission to translate critical scientific advancements in aging research into accessible health products

18:49.320 --> 18:54.280
And technologies their flagship product basis replenishes youthful levels of nad plus

18:54.840 --> 19:00.760
Activating what scientists call our longevity genes to promote healthy aging and keep you feeling younger longer

19:01.080 --> 19:07.400
Many customers report benefits such as sustained maintained energy levels less general tiredness and fatigue

19:07.640 --> 19:13.640
More satisfying workouts and support in recovery from workouts healthy skin and general health and wellness

19:13.960 --> 19:19.400
Matter Elysium's brain aging supplement was developed in partnership with the university of oxford

19:19.560 --> 19:23.560
Matter does what no other product does it slows the shrinking of our brains

19:23.800 --> 19:29.080
For most of us brain shrinkage begins in our 30s and impacts memory learning and even physical activity

19:29.400 --> 19:34.760
Lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption smoking and poor sleep habits accelerate this process

19:35.000 --> 19:41.480
Matter is patented and clinically proven to slow the age related loss in the brain's memory centers by an average of 86

19:41.560 --> 19:48.360

19:57.160 --> 19:59.160
Okay, so let's move to the second

20:01.080 --> 20:02.920
presupposition

20:02.920 --> 20:04.200
To act in the world

20:04.200 --> 20:09.160
So it's kind of a corollary or the first or something equivalent to act in the world. We must prioritize our actions

20:09.240 --> 20:11.720
I don't think we probably have to cover that right because it's

20:12.280 --> 20:18.040
Perception is an action already because you have to move your eyes and orient your head and also gripping is an action

20:18.120 --> 20:22.120
Yes, exactly. So I think that goes with it. Yeah, okay. So so we'll leave that well, okay

20:22.600 --> 20:27.240
Now this is the next this is a nice switch. I think any system of priorities

20:29.000 --> 20:35.400
Is a structure of values and then I sneak something in an ethic. So I'm kind of defining ethic as a

20:35.480 --> 20:41.240
Something approximating perhaps an internally. It's like a game. It's an internally consistent

20:42.440 --> 20:47.160
Hierarchy of value, but it's also it's going to have to be iterable in the sense that we already discussed

20:47.160 --> 20:52.120
So that's kind of what I'm defining an ethic as and then you could also think of it as something that's embodied

20:52.520 --> 20:58.040
So when you're watching someone on a screen in a movie say a character, they embody an ethic

20:58.120 --> 21:01.720
That's what makes them interesting. It's a whole structure of value

21:02.280 --> 21:08.120
And they're acting it out and it's a system of priorities of perception and action

21:08.680 --> 21:13.000
And that's a value structure. The reason it's a value structure is because well, what's the difference between

21:13.800 --> 21:15.800
prioritization and value

21:16.280 --> 21:22.760
You you prioritize what you value and so I think the difficulty I have is if you use the word ethic because the word ethic is so

21:23.320 --> 21:24.520
charged with

21:24.520 --> 21:25.800
Morality and also

21:25.800 --> 21:28.360
To the way that we're supposed to act between each other

21:28.440 --> 21:33.000
Then I think it it can be a little bit misleading because values and why is good

21:33.080 --> 21:37.640
It seems to well, I think good is fine. That is the good in the sense that there's also a good glass

21:37.640 --> 21:41.480
Which has no moral bearing at all. There's a there's a good way to walk down the hall

21:41.480 --> 21:46.920
Which is not a moral question. There's a you know, they're good way to fish, but these are not ethical ethical

21:47.160 --> 21:51.960
Maybe they are maybe yeah, maybe but I think that that's maybe the little place where I would wonder about

21:51.960 --> 21:55.320
Yeah, so that that's a terminological problem in some sense, right? Well, it is

21:55.480 --> 22:00.440
I don't know. What do you think that it seems that the word ethic seems to imply interpersonal relationships

22:00.680 --> 22:06.040
Yeah, the word ethic has been reduced to the the moral interactions ethical. Yes. Yes, whereas

22:06.840 --> 22:15.240
Typically philosophers will use the term normativity to be a much more general term for cover for the idea that there's a governing principle

22:15.320 --> 22:17.320
for your behavior

22:17.880 --> 22:21.080
Okay, so I I'll have to make sure I clarified that when I read about this

22:21.080 --> 22:26.920
But I was also thinking about, you know common fictional tropes in popular culture. So

22:28.120 --> 22:29.960
If you're watching a mafia

22:29.960 --> 22:35.960
Movie one of the things that's interesting about a mafia criminal as opposed to just your ordinary criminal is

22:36.520 --> 22:38.520
That he's not entirely chaotic

22:38.920 --> 22:43.080
Right. He abides by the mafia code. So he's loyal to his

22:44.200 --> 22:49.160
Yeah, he's loyal to a code. So it makes him a quasi-ethic actor and I would say well the mafia

22:49.480 --> 22:55.320
Character does embody an ethic and I'm kind of struggling for a word that isn't ethic

22:56.200 --> 22:59.480
You might disagree with the ethical but I think it's because I mean

22:59.480 --> 23:02.760
I think you can actually take this a lot further than than just a mafia person

23:02.760 --> 23:06.840
I think there's a way that you can be a good mass murderer

23:07.400 --> 23:09.480
that in the sense that you can you can

23:10.360 --> 23:15.240
You have discovered the hierarchy of values things you need to value in order to become a good mass murderer

23:15.480 --> 23:18.360
And now you're engaging in them towards that

23:18.840 --> 23:22.840
Hierarchy of values. There is like you could say like there are satanic hierarchies like the

23:23.560 --> 23:28.200
Columbine killers, for example, we're doing exactly that and most of the mass shooters

23:28.760 --> 23:31.640
There's a contest going on. Yeah, they know about each other

23:31.720 --> 23:37.480
They're often in fact one of them one kid who was planning to do this wrote me like six months ago

23:37.720 --> 23:44.360
He had a 50 page manifesto ready and the weapons and he watched this this youtube video

23:44.600 --> 23:48.120
Discussion I did with Warren Farrell and where we touched on this issue

23:48.360 --> 23:54.680
And he decided that there was seriously something wrong with him and that he should get some help and not do this

23:54.840 --> 23:59.160
But he was in contact with one of the people who went out and shot up a high school

23:59.480 --> 24:04.760
They'd been contact online. So he was like that far away from it. Yeah, but that's so so there is this

24:05.480 --> 24:07.480
It's not a

24:07.480 --> 24:11.960
You can have a chaotic criminal who's completely unpredictable, but then you don't have much of a plot, right?

24:11.960 --> 24:15.800
He's not an interesting character. He's gonna get caught really fast. Well, there's that too, right?

24:16.120 --> 24:20.760
The far more interesting ones have a they haven't well, I'd say they have an ethic now

24:20.760 --> 24:22.040
It's not an ethical ethic, right?

24:22.040 --> 24:27.880
So that's why the word ethic is difficult because you could say that ultimately what you're gonna what's gonna happen is that there will be

24:28.440 --> 24:34.440
A hierarchy of value systems. Yeah, we'll be more related to the good in the in the classical sense that is played out

24:34.520 --> 24:39.560
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Exactly. And this is Plato's argument that nobody willingly does evil

24:39.720 --> 24:42.680
Everybody does what they conceive to be a good in some fact

24:42.680 --> 24:49.240
Yeah, you see that in Dante you see the same is whole movement. He even talks about how the people inhale everybody is there because of

24:49.320 --> 24:51.720
I'm reading the divine comedy right now. That's wonderful. Yeah, that's great

24:52.200 --> 24:54.600
Everybody who is there is there because of love

24:55.160 --> 24:59.400
For a good even though even if they love the good too much or they're mistaken about

24:59.640 --> 25:01.960
Let's say the actual ultimate value of that good

25:02.360 --> 25:06.280
Everybody moves towards a good even if you're doing something which is completely reprehensible

25:06.440 --> 25:12.680
Yeah, the proposal that sin is actually failing to love wisely. Yeah, that's the don't you see that I have

25:12.840 --> 25:16.520
I have some problem with that viewpoint because I think I think that happens

25:16.600 --> 25:19.080
I do think that happens and I think many of the

25:19.480 --> 25:24.440
You know, I've talked to people like my friend Greg Hurwitz who writes thrillers and he crafts pretty evil characters

25:24.520 --> 25:26.520
And we've talked about that a lot

25:27.240 --> 25:31.800
An evil character with an ethic so like a misplaced love is is a very interesting character

25:31.800 --> 25:36.200
But then there's the other sorts of characters that are more cane like because cane

25:37.320 --> 25:40.520
His spirit that the spirit that's expressed in that story

25:41.800 --> 25:43.800
his

25:43.960 --> 25:47.000
He isn't aiming at something that's good. He's aiming at

25:47.800 --> 25:50.760
Getting away with lying to god. He's aiming at getting away with making

25:51.480 --> 25:55.800
Insufficient sacrifices. He's aiming at getting away eventually with murder

25:56.280 --> 26:01.560
It's not a perversion of the good and I think that we underestimate the problem of evil if we assume

26:01.880 --> 26:06.840
That it's merely a consequence of worshiping false idols say because the idol can be so

26:07.080 --> 26:13.000
It's like I talked to you last night about the reports that michelle fuko rape boys in graveyards. It's like

26:13.640 --> 26:14.840
okay

26:14.840 --> 26:16.680
He argued even formally

26:16.680 --> 26:22.600
Culturally to abolish or at least radically reduce the age of consent and a lot of intellectuals went along with them

26:22.840 --> 26:27.560
And maybe you can have a discussion about that and what the age of consent could be and maybe you can't

26:27.640 --> 26:30.200
there's room for differences in opinion there, but

26:31.080 --> 26:35.560
When your pedophilia involves graveyard sex

26:36.280 --> 26:38.280
Then that's not a misplaced good

26:38.520 --> 26:41.960
Like that's that's that's but why not george. Why why isn't that

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Pleasure is a good

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Right and and well, it's so specific

26:48.040 --> 26:51.160
You know, why the graveyard like there's something so dark

26:51.320 --> 26:55.880
I don't think there's I think that's a place that's so dark that you can't go there without knowing that it's dark

26:56.200 --> 26:59.080
And I do think that I really do believe and you know

26:59.160 --> 27:04.760
I've done my best to study the thought of people who've done truly reprehensible things is that there's a level of

27:05.400 --> 27:12.440
Reprehensibility where you are going there to cause the most trouble you can't and I don't see

27:13.160 --> 27:17.160
If there's any good left in that it's such a tiny really gonna be like that

27:17.240 --> 27:19.560
I'm really gonna be the devil's advocate here knowing that

27:20.280 --> 27:23.960
There are some that do it better than others and some that don't do it as well

27:24.360 --> 27:29.880
Even recognizing that the good that they're aiming towards is is not really transcendentally

27:29.960 --> 27:31.960
Their memory has to be working their problems

27:31.960 --> 27:36.680
Right, that is that they that it's like if I yeah, so they're still driven by a coherent spirit

27:36.760 --> 27:40.200
Well, that's what I think the spirit of lucifer and this and the spirit of girth is

27:41.080 --> 27:46.280
Mephistopheles that's that's and the spirit of cane. That's a description of that ethic

27:46.520 --> 27:49.400
It does you know it is it is a coherent personality

27:49.640 --> 27:51.960
And that's why there's so much well and Milton as well

27:52.040 --> 27:59.080
It's it's there's been an attempt to delineate the ethic of evil and and it's not merely chaotic

27:59.240 --> 28:02.360
And the reason one of the reasons why it's important and maybe it's hard to

28:02.920 --> 28:05.320
To see that right away, but one of the reasons why it's important

28:05.640 --> 28:10.040
At least I find it important to formulate it this way the way the Dante formulated it or that Plato

28:10.440 --> 28:13.400
Formulated it is that if you don't go in this direction

28:13.720 --> 28:17.960
You end up with a dualism and then they end up acting as like two opposites

28:18.360 --> 28:23.800
Whereas there's the the more platonic way of setting it up what ends up happening is that

28:24.520 --> 28:28.440
The evil always ends up just being a perversion of the good right is parasitic

28:29.080 --> 28:35.320
It's always parasitic and so what what it does is that it makes the good truly good and it makes it all pervasive

28:35.560 --> 28:38.040
And a way in which it can actually fill up the entire

28:38.920 --> 28:43.480
Cosmos, you know the this idea that even in the death of hell the love of god is there

28:43.560 --> 28:47.800
Like you see that in a lot of the christian mystic that there is no place that is

28:48.200 --> 28:53.320
Okay, so let me ask you about that on the grounds of christian theology

28:53.800 --> 28:57.320
So and I'm probably going to mangle this and so correct me

28:57.640 --> 29:02.360
Well, there's an idea that in the book of revelation that christ is the eternal judge

29:02.440 --> 29:06.360
but that he's also a judge who comes back at the end of days and

29:07.080 --> 29:12.360
Separates the wheat from the chaff the damned from the saved and the implication in that

29:13.000 --> 29:14.760
book is that

29:14.760 --> 29:20.120
Many are called but few are chosen the judgment's pretty damn harsh and most

29:21.400 --> 29:27.720
Most what most spirits are damned most people are damned and then is that eternal or is there a

29:28.840 --> 29:32.280
reconciliation and so I don't know the answer to that so the

29:32.760 --> 29:34.280
Christian

29:34.680 --> 29:36.680
The best way

29:36.680 --> 29:37.800
This is gonna

29:37.800 --> 29:39.480
This is the type of thing that could actually get me in trouble

29:39.480 --> 29:41.880
But like the best way to formulate it

29:41.880 --> 29:47.160
I think that we're seeing in the orthodox tradition right now is to say that we live in the hope of

29:47.800 --> 29:49.640
Of a final restoration

29:49.640 --> 29:53.240
But that we cannot universal redemption, but we cannot posit it because

29:54.200 --> 29:58.920
You like you said there are seems to be there seem to be two traditions in the christian world

29:59.240 --> 30:02.760
There is a tradition of final restoration which you find in revelation as well

30:02.760 --> 30:06.760
By the way, because it says the last thing to die is death itself right there

30:06.840 --> 30:08.840
There's the sense of death is thrown into the fire

30:08.920 --> 30:14.680
And so the last what exactly is that referring to the the sense in which the heavenly druslim descends and embodies

30:15.000 --> 30:21.400
Fills up the entire world. So you have these images and then you also have an image of evil being completely

30:22.120 --> 30:24.840
Let's say cast off and those two kind of exist in a

30:25.160 --> 30:31.880
Yeah, well, it's it's I was thinking this about just the other day when I was thinking about making a video address to

30:32.600 --> 30:35.640
Do the islamic world as preposterous as that might sound

30:37.000 --> 30:41.480
Because one of the things you want to do when you're talking to people is you want to distinguish between

30:42.040 --> 30:48.200
them as of intrinsic value and redeemable in some final sense just as you are and

30:48.680 --> 30:55.560
Ideas that might be possessing them that have either this misplaced good element to them or this vengeful element and so

30:56.680 --> 30:59.080
You know, you don't want to throw to use a horrible cliche

30:59.160 --> 31:01.160
You don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water

31:01.160 --> 31:04.120
And so maybe the separation of the wheat from the chaff is

31:04.600 --> 31:08.680
A spiritual discrimination that doesn't throw out the entire

31:09.160 --> 31:14.520
Being along with the judgment you understand it fractally then I think that that makes sense

31:15.400 --> 31:20.280
If you read like for example, c.s. Lewis is a great example of someone who kind of was going in that direction

31:20.280 --> 31:27.000
Was hinting at some things he talked about how like the this notion that the key to hell is hell is locked from the inside

31:27.480 --> 31:28.760
right

31:28.760 --> 31:35.160
No matter even like I think c.s. Lewis said like even in the depth of in the depth of hell if satan wanted

31:35.560 --> 31:41.000
To repent there's well that's what Milton said but that's not but that's not it's like it's not happening because that's the role

31:41.400 --> 31:44.920
That's in the story. This is the character that helped me understand this

31:45.400 --> 31:46.200
part of

31:46.200 --> 31:50.360
The cosmos that or the part of the way that the world is laying itself out and you see that

31:50.920 --> 31:54.280
In in in some of the syrian fathers for example said that from the syrian

31:54.280 --> 32:00.600
He he says things like that where he says there's the the fire in hell is the same fire that was at pentacos

32:01.160 --> 32:03.160
The fire in hell is the love of god

32:03.640 --> 32:09.160
And it's and it's and it's it's only that to the extent that you refuse to be transformed

32:09.160 --> 32:11.960
Yeah, and you hold on to your let's say

32:12.520 --> 32:19.400
Parasitic good that is what the fire hell well right well part of that is is that as you become more divorced from

32:19.880 --> 32:24.520
Let's say what constitutes a sustainable and valid good the farther you get away from that

32:24.840 --> 32:29.240
Whether it's merely by pursuing a misplaced good or it's by conscious design

32:29.800 --> 32:31.080
the more that

32:31.080 --> 32:38.040
Elevates itself up as the harshest possible judge that will do the most damage to your current ethic and then

32:38.120 --> 32:40.520
destabilize your whole perceptions and so

32:41.240 --> 32:43.480
That's so interesting because as you deviate

32:44.600 --> 32:46.840
Speaking spiritually as you deviate from god

32:46.920 --> 32:47.960
He becomes more

32:47.960 --> 32:53.880
tyrannical in in some sense to you and more judgmental and it's also partly because this is why the catholic

32:54.920 --> 32:59.800
idea of confession is isn't what's often pilloried because you know people laugh

33:00.120 --> 33:06.040
Well, you're a catholic you can sin your whole life and on your deathbed you can repent. It's like yeah, but you have to

33:06.120 --> 33:09.800
Face the magnitude of everything you did wrong

33:10.440 --> 33:15.480
So repentance isn't just well. I'm sorry. It's like you're actually sorry

33:15.880 --> 33:19.400
And if you've stacked up a whole lifetime of a lifetime of sins

33:19.880 --> 33:26.440
What makes you think that you're going to have the moral wherewithal on your deathbed to confront that without anything

33:27.160 --> 33:33.160
Well, it's just absolute existential terror is so it's there's no easy out from that so

33:33.880 --> 33:35.880
So

33:39.480 --> 33:41.480
I mean, I thought the discussion was

33:42.200 --> 33:45.800
um important um and and what you just said jordan is important I I

33:46.360 --> 33:52.600
I I for I for one who would not look want immortality because when I look back at the foolishness and

33:53.160 --> 33:55.160
And the vices of my past

33:55.400 --> 33:56.760
um

33:56.760 --> 33:59.720
Yeah, it's it's it's hard. It's and so

33:59.800 --> 34:05.480
Um people who think they could just sort of sin and mouth. I don't mouth the repentance

34:05.480 --> 34:09.480
I don't think that's well. They also think they can in some sense pull one over god

34:09.560 --> 34:17.000
Yeah, but or we could we'll abide by this rule that will never use religious language week when we can use any other kind of language

34:17.080 --> 34:24.280
No, no, no, I know I know you weren't objecting to that. I think it's a good principle. I'm happy. I'm happy to talk about it

34:25.080 --> 34:27.080
I I I'll but I don't

34:27.480 --> 34:29.000
um

34:29.000 --> 34:30.600
Well, let me say

34:30.600 --> 34:33.480
There's there's something underneath the religious discussion

34:34.280 --> 34:38.440
That is sort of a central concern to me at this point. Um

34:39.080 --> 34:41.080
And I'll invoke caught

34:41.160 --> 34:43.880
Um caught right the three critiques

34:44.520 --> 34:50.360
Right the critique of pure reason practical reason judgment, right and and and Habermas makes a great point of this

34:50.440 --> 34:52.440
I'm coming to it. I'm coming to the point which is

34:53.160 --> 34:58.440
We don't seem since caught we don't have an integrated normativity

34:59.160 --> 35:02.360
We have three autonomous spheres of normativity

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Around the true the epistemic

35:05.560 --> 35:12.280
The good and the beautiful and what what what caught did and one of the problems of modernity and this is Habermas's point

35:12.680 --> 35:14.680
Is he made a very strong case

35:14.680 --> 35:20.680
For the autonomy of each right beauty is beauty. So that's partly why you objected in the way you did when you emailed me back

35:20.760 --> 35:27.800
Exactly you I was talking about an ethic that would unite and you said well, it's differentiated true beautiful and good

35:28.040 --> 35:32.200
Right my my response to that would be something like well, whatever god is

35:33.320 --> 35:38.440
Fundamentally ineffable. So we'll we'll make that yeah, we'll make that clear to begin with

35:39.000 --> 35:39.800
but

35:39.800 --> 35:41.160
I would say that

35:41.160 --> 35:47.400
One way of thinking about the way we think about god is that god is what's common to the good the true and the beautiful

35:47.720 --> 35:52.440
So this gets us into the the the the discussion that I think is for me

35:53.320 --> 35:55.560
sort of the deepest levels of the phenomenology

35:56.120 --> 35:58.120
And the cognition which is I mean that

35:58.600 --> 36:03.240
Jonathan would know this is the classical doctrine the classical way of putting this is the convertible of the

36:03.640 --> 36:06.200
The the the transcendentals are convertible into each other

36:06.440 --> 36:12.760
So somehow the true and the good and and and the beautiful are one but not mathematical identity

36:12.840 --> 36:16.120
This is really important. It's not right you can write and so

36:16.680 --> 36:22.600
And you know the coinus wrestles with this max. I've been reading maximus, but I think you see a reflection of that in the idea

36:22.600 --> 36:28.920
The trinity too, of course, right and and and and so the issue there is

36:30.840 --> 36:35.480
And I've been reading DC Schindler on the Catholicity of reason and he talks about this he gets it from baltazar

36:35.560 --> 36:38.280
he talks about the primacy of

36:40.280 --> 36:47.080
The primacy of beauty the centrality of goodness and the ultimacy of truth that that they they are superlative but in different ways

36:47.560 --> 36:51.800
So what he means by that is there's a primacy to beauty and and this is a classic platonic argument

36:52.280 --> 36:55.720
If you don't have beauty all the other normativities are not available to you, right?

36:56.680 --> 36:58.680
so why right

36:59.640 --> 37:06.120
I wrote a chapter in my last book on the necessity of beauty, but but I don't understand why that why prime why primary

37:06.920 --> 37:11.880
Because and what does that say about our perception that it's primary and so right because you don't have to think about it

37:12.040 --> 37:14.200
Is that part of it? Is that you apprehend it?

37:14.600 --> 37:17.160
I don't understand well a way of thinking about it is

37:17.560 --> 37:21.560
scarry wrote a really beautiful book called beauty and how it prepares us for truth and justice

37:22.120 --> 37:27.880
And the idea so let let's let's let's take let's take something that's that's very culturally relevant

37:27.880 --> 37:30.280
And I've something I've been talking about so we we are

37:30.920 --> 37:34.600
We are immersed in what recur called a hermeneutics of suspicion

37:35.160 --> 37:41.960
The hermeneutics of suspicion is that appearances are always distorting distracting deceiving us from reality

37:42.040 --> 37:45.480
That's the hermeneutics of suspicion and the moment of truth is when you reveal

37:46.200 --> 37:50.280
The hidden cabal the conspiracy, right? This is the hermeneutics of suspicion

37:50.600 --> 37:54.280
And it's you know, and and and recur's point is we got this that's what Freud does

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Freud and it's the uncovering

37:57.560 --> 38:02.120
Here's what's really going on in the deconstruction is here's what's read exactly. It's everywhere now

38:02.600 --> 38:08.120
Right. Okay. Now. Yeah. Yeah. Now. Here's marlapunty's point about this, right? His point is but wait

38:08.680 --> 38:10.680
the hermeneutics

38:10.680 --> 38:17.640
Of that the hermeneutics of suspicion is always dependent on this if I say that's unreal. Oh, look

38:18.360 --> 38:20.360
I do that because I say that's real

38:20.920 --> 38:24.920
Realization is always a comparative judgment. This is his point

38:25.560 --> 38:31.000
So the and so does he accept the notion that there is something because one of the things you see in the post-modern types

38:31.080 --> 38:34.040
And I was looking at Richard Rorty the work the other day

38:34.040 --> 38:36.840
And he seems to buy the post-modern idea that

38:37.320 --> 38:42.120
Everything is just a network of linguistic representation and that there is no real beyond that

38:42.280 --> 38:45.800
That's that's Dylan's critique of that being similarly logical reductionism

38:45.880 --> 38:49.880
All you do is transfer all the markers of reality onto properties of the text

38:50.280 --> 38:55.320
And then you you you prevent the text from being subject to the very criticisms you're making of reality

38:55.480 --> 39:01.560
Yeah, well that that that seems credible to me. Okay. So so so it was marlapunty accepts the reality of beauty

39:02.520 --> 39:07.160
Exactly because think about what this means if the hermeneutics of suspicion is

39:07.800 --> 39:15.880
Right that appearances distract us deceive us right there has to be something under that right and beauty is when appearances disclose reality

39:16.680 --> 39:17.880
Yeah

39:17.880 --> 39:20.920
That's the that's what I mean. That's what I believe that that's the artist

39:21.000 --> 39:27.640
I mean that's the artist take or that's the liturgical take or it's the the beauty of an of a church or the beauty of an icon

39:27.720 --> 39:29.720
or the it's it's the notion that

39:30.680 --> 39:37.960
That that god or ultimate reality or however you want to phrase it is disclosing itself to us and that appears to us

39:38.520 --> 39:40.520
as the connection between

39:40.680 --> 39:47.160
That which we encounter these these patterned beings that we encounter and what they reveal to us about the other transcendentals

39:48.280 --> 39:51.400
Well, when I wrote this chapter, which is my favorite chapter in both books

39:51.480 --> 39:54.120
It's try to make one room in your house as beautiful as possible

39:54.120 --> 39:56.120
And so this sort of step behind

39:56.200 --> 40:01.320
Well order your room first so that it's just not cluttered and and idiotic and and

40:01.880 --> 40:06.680
Running at counter purposes to whatever your purposes are a reflection of your internal chaos

40:07.160 --> 40:12.600
Get it orderly, but that's not good enough. The next thing is see if you can make a relationship with beauty, which is really

40:13.080 --> 40:19.480
It's it's really uh people are afraid of that a because I've watched people try to buy art and they're terrified of buying art

40:19.560 --> 40:21.560
and the reason is is because

40:21.560 --> 40:24.520
Their choice puts their taste on display

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
and if their taste is

40:27.080 --> 40:32.680
undeveloped then their inability to distinguish between a false appearance and

40:33.000 --> 40:39.000
The genuine reality of beauty is immediately revealed to people so they're terrified of it, but they're also equally

40:39.480 --> 40:42.520
Terrified of beauty. So let me tell you a story about this if you don't mind

40:43.080 --> 40:47.080
I I bought some russian impressionist paintings for my father

40:47.880 --> 40:51.000
And I liked them a lot. I this particular artist

40:52.760 --> 40:57.880
The russian impressionist style is like the french impressionist style except it's a lot rougher the brushstrokes are

40:58.760 --> 41:03.320
Thicker and so it's lower resolution, but it's equally beautiful in terms of palette

41:03.560 --> 41:06.520
And I have a variety of paintings if you get some distance from them

41:06.520 --> 41:09.480
They just snap into representations so lovely

41:09.720 --> 41:14.200
And so I sent my dad like eight of these paintings and my mom took one look at them and she said

41:14.760 --> 41:16.760
Those are not coming out of the basement

41:16.920 --> 41:23.480
And so and my mom is is a conservative person so she's not high in openness. She's not that interested in ideas

41:23.800 --> 41:26.680
And she's not and her aesthetic sense isn't

41:27.240 --> 41:29.800
Sophisticated now my mother has a lot of lovely attributes

41:29.880 --> 41:35.480
But but and my dad and her differ in that and so I he loved these paintings and then he made these

41:36.200 --> 41:39.000
frames for them and then he brought one up

41:39.640 --> 41:43.400
And my mom tolerated that and then he brought another one up

41:43.400 --> 41:47.320
And then she tolerated that and then like all eight of them eventually made it upstairs

41:47.400 --> 41:51.560
And then a few years later I was there and she told me how much she loved the paintings

41:51.960 --> 41:55.320
But it really they really set her off and I think it was partly because

41:56.200 --> 41:58.200
well, if you're

41:58.200 --> 42:02.920
Imagine you have you're you're comfortable in your canonical perceptions of objects in some sense

42:02.920 --> 42:07.080
And then the impressionist come along and say, you know, you could look at that whole landscape as if it was nothing

42:07.080 --> 42:11.000
But the interplay of color and that's we forget how radical that is

42:11.000 --> 42:11.480
I mean

42:11.480 --> 42:17.560
Those paintings caused riots in Paris when they were first showed impressionist paintings and that's what my mother was reacting to

42:17.560 --> 42:20.760
It's like, oh my god, there's a whole different way of looking at the world

42:20.840 --> 42:23.560
I don't want to see that and it's an invitation to

42:24.440 --> 42:30.120
That which is beyond the triviality of your perceptions, let's say, but it's to think that there's nothing about that that's

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Worth being frightened of or challenging

42:34.520 --> 42:36.920
You don't understand conservatives if you don't see that

42:37.320 --> 42:39.880
So but in terms of in terms of beauty

42:40.360 --> 42:47.320
One of the things that also that especially now you can one of the the problems or the the way the beauty can kind of overwhelm us

42:47.400 --> 42:52.280
Is that we feel as if if we give ourselves we we're afraid of the

42:52.760 --> 42:58.280
The suspicion the hermeneutics of suspicion. We're afraid that if we we see reality discloses itself to us

42:58.360 --> 43:02.680
And we can see the connection between that which is appearing to me and some

43:03.480 --> 43:07.240
Something behind it and I'm afraid that if I jump if I make that leap

43:07.640 --> 43:13.400
Then I'll be betrayed or all that or that it will right that it won't turn out to be real or well

43:13.560 --> 43:19.880
Sometimes it sometimes it's not like some there are there is it is possible to to be tricked by

43:20.520 --> 43:23.160
By appearance and this gets you to to haunt

43:23.720 --> 43:27.560
You know saving beauty his critique of what you see going on right now

43:28.120 --> 43:33.400
Is he he he argues if you read ancient texts if you read platinus one of the features they'll say

43:33.800 --> 43:36.600
About beauty is it striking and disturbing and disrupting?

43:37.080 --> 43:41.320
Right. I'll I want to come back to that about the the transformative aspect of truth

43:41.720 --> 43:43.880
But but right the transformative theory of truth

43:44.360 --> 43:48.520
But and hawn talks about now what we've done right and he talks about in other books too

43:48.760 --> 43:51.720
Is we've reduced we try to reduce the beautiful to the smooth

43:52.520 --> 43:56.920
Which is the the ease at which we can consume something

43:57.080 --> 44:03.000
Like the smooth out of cover of a car exactly right one pixel resolution. Yes. Yes

44:03.480 --> 44:05.480
And and and because

44:05.640 --> 44:09.560
Because what that does is it gives you and I'll use this word deliberately the veneer

44:09.960 --> 44:13.880
Of beauty with but while protecting you from the hermetic suspicion

44:14.280 --> 44:18.120
Yeah, right you see that so what we do is and then he says in pornography

44:18.440 --> 44:24.520
Is the primary example of that because what you do is you remove all threat all mystery all otherness

44:24.680 --> 44:30.040
Of from the person so there's no way they can strike you or disturb you. There's no way to reject you. Yeah, right

44:30.280 --> 44:33.560
Yes, exactly. And the and so pornography is an example of

44:34.280 --> 44:38.600
Of the smooth completely overtaking the beautiful and being misunderstood

44:39.160 --> 44:40.920
as beautiful

44:40.920 --> 44:45.320
But if that's if you if you gentlemen are in agreement with that what that means

44:45.560 --> 44:51.720
That's my answer to why the primacy of beauty because if you do not get that ability

44:52.360 --> 44:54.360
To and I want to use this word

44:55.080 --> 45:00.840
Sorry, please go ahead then I'll ask. Yeah, I I want to say through the way I'm saying like through my glasses

45:01.320 --> 45:07.800
Beyond and by means of if we can't properly get a moment where we can see through appearance into reality

45:08.280 --> 45:10.280
We are locked

45:10.280 --> 45:12.280
Into solipsism and skepticism

45:12.600 --> 45:19.560
You need a primary and if you do it if you do it rather than it is called to you then you are trapped

45:20.040 --> 45:24.680
But you need you need something that calls you from beyond appearances

45:25.080 --> 45:29.160
So that you can properly align appearances to reality and you realize

45:29.560 --> 45:34.680
That's why the primacy. So is that the ontological calling you out of epistemology?

45:35.640 --> 45:41.720
I would argue that that's Plato's argument for what how the beauty how so when you say, okay, so

45:42.600 --> 45:45.720
I I've thought thought a lot about the relationship between love and truth

45:45.720 --> 45:49.400
And I think love is primary and the truth is the handmaiden of love in some sense

45:49.480 --> 45:53.000
But but so there's a primacy there. I would say the primacy of love

45:53.080 --> 45:57.080
But you're making an argument for the primacy of beauty. And so are they contradictory?

45:57.160 --> 45:59.160
no, no, no, no not at all because

45:59.880 --> 46:00.840
Plato's

46:00.840 --> 46:05.400
View of love and you have to be careful because Plato is taking the greek notion of eros

46:05.640 --> 46:07.240
And he's trying to bend it

46:07.240 --> 46:10.920
And I think he's trying to bend it towards what the christians are going to eventually talk about in agape

46:11.000 --> 46:13.720
Right. Okay. So take that as a caveat on what I'm saying

46:13.960 --> 46:17.800
But nevertheless, what's going on, right is Plato says no, no, no

46:18.200 --> 46:21.080
What love is is that you are called

46:21.640 --> 46:22.760
to beauty

46:22.760 --> 46:27.800
And let me let me let me let me let me just try and show you give me a sec because there's a connection

46:27.800 --> 46:32.840
Yeah, okay. So a lot this will sound like where's he took out of left field but like

46:33.800 --> 46:35.800
truth rationality

46:36.040 --> 46:37.880
Most of the cognitive biases

46:37.880 --> 46:41.880
In fact, there's a growing argument that a lot of the cognitive biases confirmation bias, blah, blah, blah

46:42.120 --> 46:44.120
A lot of them are actually

46:44.200 --> 46:46.200
versions aspects of the myside bias

46:47.000 --> 46:50.120
Uh, egocentrism. I won't make that argument here. I think it's a good argument

46:50.520 --> 46:53.720
But let's say even if it's only partially true. This is an important point

46:54.600 --> 46:56.600
And spinosa got this right

46:57.240 --> 47:00.920
This orientation self relevance how things are relevant to me

47:01.800 --> 47:06.760
Right that sort of fundamental egocentrism a fundamental way in which you're prioritizing

47:07.160 --> 47:11.720
Your perception on the world, right? You can't reason your way out of that

47:12.200 --> 47:15.160
spinosa the most logical of the philosopher says no, no

47:15.640 --> 47:21.240
The only thing that will invert the arrow of relevance is love. This is murdoch's point

47:21.480 --> 47:24.680
Love is when you recognize something other than yourself is real, right?

47:25.080 --> 47:27.720
Okay, so so let's okay. Let me ask you about that because

47:28.280 --> 47:31.320
I've been thinking about the idea of being selfish. Yes, you know

47:31.560 --> 47:34.520
Well psychopaths are selfish, but they also betray themselves

47:34.760 --> 47:39.400
Yes, because psychopaths don't learn from experience and they doom their future selves

47:39.720 --> 47:42.440
And so I kind of wonder if that love that

47:43.080 --> 47:44.920
lifts you out of

47:44.920 --> 47:51.400
This self orientation what it does in some sense is that it's the way you see the world if you see

47:53.080 --> 47:58.360
Beyond this narrow selfishness because I don't really think there's any difference technically

47:58.760 --> 48:05.480
In me in me taking care of the multitude of future selves that I will become and me treating you properly

48:05.560 --> 48:11.320
I totally agree. Okay. Okay. I think your relationship to your future self is ultimately an agopic relationship

48:11.480 --> 48:16.760
And I think that's the only way you can deal with a lot of empirical research. Okay. So you do you do? Yes

48:17.320 --> 48:21.160
Oh, why the empirical research because I think the empirical research shows that

48:21.960 --> 48:24.920
Like the I mentioned it in the Cambridge talk that I sent you the way

48:25.480 --> 48:27.480
Right what if you do this

48:28.040 --> 48:33.640
This is one instance among many experiments you go into a bunch of academics at a university

48:33.640 --> 48:36.600
The people who are supposed to be the best at taking data and processing it

48:36.760 --> 48:41.160
You present them with all the evidence that they should start saving for their retirement right now, right?

48:41.400 --> 48:43.960
And they won't do it. You come back six months later

48:44.120 --> 48:46.200
They will they will they you ask them at the time

48:46.680 --> 48:51.560
Is this argument a solid solid argument great evidence? Yeah, come back six months. Have they changed not at all?

48:51.560 --> 48:55.560
Yeah, the behaviorist behavioral therapists know that perfectly well, right? Yeah, but

48:56.360 --> 48:59.480
So if you but if you do the following you say I want you to

49:00.760 --> 49:07.160
Imagine your future self as a family member that you love and care about right right. They will start to

49:08.040 --> 49:14.280
Save and more importantly the vividness of that imagery predicts how well that's so cool

49:14.440 --> 49:18.280
Look, you know this this program that we worked on the future authoring program

49:18.440 --> 49:21.400
Well, it's predicated on the idea of developing

49:22.200 --> 49:27.320
A love for your future self. So so it's an exercise is in a real sense

49:27.320 --> 49:29.480
it's it's like here and it's

49:29.480 --> 49:32.840
The ethic that's underneath it although this wasn't particularly

49:33.560 --> 49:35.560
conscious in my mind when I built it was

49:37.080 --> 49:39.080
Knock and the door will open it's like okay

49:39.960 --> 49:41.960
Let's play a game you get to have

49:42.840 --> 49:44.840
What you want and need

49:44.920 --> 49:49.080
But the rule is first of all you have to accept it and second of all you have to specify it

49:49.400 --> 49:51.080
And so but let's just play it as a game

49:51.640 --> 49:55.320
If you could if you could envision a future that would justify your suffering

49:55.400 --> 49:58.200
That's a really good way of thinking about it justify your suffering

49:58.680 --> 50:02.360
What would that entail and then people and then I make it practical

50:02.440 --> 50:04.920
It's like well, what do you want for an intimate relationship?

50:05.080 --> 50:10.440
How do you want to treat your family members? What sort of job or career like I break it into seven practicalities, you know

50:10.680 --> 50:12.680
To nail it down to the ground

50:13.000 --> 50:16.440
And I do believe that see one of the things we found we thought well

50:16.440 --> 50:18.840
What predicts whether or not this works because it really works

50:18.920 --> 50:22.760
We dropped the dropout rate of young men at moho college 50 percent

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
It should it should well it did yes

50:25.080 --> 50:30.920
And and it had the biggest effect on those who were doing the worst which is not very common for psychological interventions

50:31.240 --> 50:33.240
But one the only thing we could find

50:34.040 --> 50:39.080
Content-wise that predicted how well it would work was number of words written

50:39.560 --> 50:44.680
And so my sense was well that just was an index a rough index of how much thought they put into it

50:44.920 --> 50:50.920
And how vividly and then it would be did they treat their future self with some love like genuinely

50:51.080 --> 50:56.760
And then did they differentiate that so it wasn't just an abstract mountaintop conceptualization

50:57.160 --> 51:00.520
So but let's add one wrinkle that brings the beauty thing back

51:01.160 --> 51:04.600
Because you go back and ask them. Why didn't you pay attention to your future self?

51:05.320 --> 51:10.200
Before well sometimes people don't think they could they have no idea that that's even a possibility

51:10.280 --> 51:17.800
That's I don't deny that yeah, but overwhelmingly people said I don't want to look at that person because that's me old and ugly

51:18.200 --> 51:21.400
They're afraid of it. Yeah, and it's an aesthetic judgment

51:22.360 --> 51:26.600
It's an aesthetic judgment and what you have to do is get them to reform it

51:27.160 --> 51:34.280
But what if that's an old it's a shallow aesthetic judgment. Yes, that's right exactly my wife. She she she does portraits

51:34.600 --> 51:40.760
And one of the things that's really interesting about my wife's art is she will look at she's like goya, although, you know

51:40.920 --> 51:45.240
Goya is goya obviously, but one of the things I really found striking about Tammy is

51:45.560 --> 51:49.560
Like she did a very detailed picture of my daughter's surgical wound

51:50.040 --> 51:54.280
And that's not an easy thing to look at right because you don't want to look at that

51:54.600 --> 51:58.040
But that also ties in with the ideas we've been discussing about the fact that

51:58.760 --> 52:00.760
so in in the story of exodus

52:00.840 --> 52:01.720
when

52:01.720 --> 52:06.040
God tells moses how to stop the israelites from being bitten by poisonous snakes

52:06.040 --> 52:09.160
He insists that they have to look at what's poisoning them

52:09.720 --> 52:14.280
And well, I think that's the with the mystery. Yes, the mystery of the crucifix. You bet right

52:14.840 --> 52:18.920
Yeah, all these images that we have like the beauty of christ wounds all these things which sound so

52:19.560 --> 52:21.000
completely

52:21.000 --> 52:27.640
Pathological yeah to many people if you can understand them properly you can understand that that you have to gaze on that which most threatens you

52:27.720 --> 52:33.400
Yeah, there's right there's a verse and then then you say well this inadequacy of vulnerability that characterizes old age

52:34.360 --> 52:41.000
That's a terror in that yeah, and so people won't go there right but you what you do is you replace the shallow aesthetic

52:41.720 --> 52:43.720
Right, don't let the appearances

52:44.120 --> 52:47.880
Right right distract you right let the experiences disclose

52:48.600 --> 52:52.440
What if that was an old family member right always look through

52:52.920 --> 52:58.360
And see that those appearances are that's somebody who's been there right that you care about someone you love

52:58.600 --> 53:03.560
Exactly and so you beautify them so you love them and the love and the beauty they reinforce each other

53:03.880 --> 53:08.840
So for me to answer your question right the the you you're saying the primacy of love

53:09.320 --> 53:11.320
And I think you ultimately me an agape glove

53:11.640 --> 53:13.640
right that and beauty

53:14.200 --> 53:16.040
if you're incapable

53:16.040 --> 53:18.680
of turning the arrow of relevance and saying

53:19.240 --> 53:23.400
I want that to exist rather than I want that to exist for me

53:24.520 --> 53:25.560
Right

53:25.560 --> 53:29.400
That's what beauty does and that's also the central move. I would argue in love

53:29.880 --> 53:36.360
Okay, so do we do we want to detour into the true and the it's beautiful true and beautiful true and the good the good

53:37.560 --> 53:41.080
Do you have something equally revealing to say about the good and

53:41.960 --> 53:43.000
The true

53:43.000 --> 53:44.120
Yeah, I do okay

53:44.200 --> 53:48.920
Well, let's let's let's let's go there and then we'll continue through this because I thought that was really useful

53:49.080 --> 53:55.480
Well, and and and I would like this if I if I would request that we return back to that whatever this discourse would

53:55.720 --> 53:59.000
I I love following the the logos. That's that that that I

53:59.560 --> 54:02.040
I aspire to be like socrates like a true christian

54:02.600 --> 54:09.400
Well, but it's mostly like a two follower of socrates too right fair enough fair enough right and but I I'm hoping that in this

54:09.800 --> 54:12.600
in this deal logos if we if we get into the depths

54:13.160 --> 54:17.320
Of the true the good and the beautiful that we can address my criticism of you

54:17.560 --> 54:22.440
Yep, which is I'm making a criticism on behalf of the of the enlightenment and cost. Yes, yes

54:22.440 --> 54:27.400
Which is the fracturing of the the normativities into three autonomous spheres

54:27.720 --> 54:32.120
Yeah, and this argument if it's going to go forward needs something that would

54:33.000 --> 54:38.920
Yeah, I see I see I see what you're doing. You bet. Yeah. Is that okay with you? Yeah, that's all right, okay

54:39.480 --> 54:41.480
so for me

54:42.040 --> 54:44.040
The the the thing I want to say

54:44.520 --> 54:46.520
first about about the good

54:46.920 --> 54:48.040
is

54:48.040 --> 54:51.160
There's two readings to make about about this

54:52.040 --> 54:57.000
And one is and this is what the enlightenment did we can reduce and jonathan's already challenged this

54:57.240 --> 55:01.560
But we can reduce the ethical we can sort we can reduce the good to the ethical good

55:01.720 --> 55:07.080
So that when we're talking about goodness, we're asking how moral a person is in their standard modern meeting, right?

55:08.040 --> 55:09.160
now

55:09.400 --> 55:10.280
what

55:10.280 --> 55:14.440
Plato argues is that is actually a derivative form of goodness

55:15.320 --> 55:18.360
It's kind of an algorithmic form. It's kind of an algorithmic form

55:18.360 --> 55:22.920
But so so here's the the central sort of at least I would argue now

55:22.920 --> 55:27.400
Of course, there's going to be 10,000 plateness will disagree with everything I say because play does been around so long

55:27.720 --> 55:30.440
Right, but I think I could make a good case and I think this lines up with

55:31.080 --> 55:38.040
The best book I've ever read on play though DC Schindler's a Plato's critique of impure reason the best book hands down my whole life

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
DC Schindler's astonishing

55:41.240 --> 55:43.240
But here's a here's a proposal

55:43.800 --> 55:45.800
right

55:46.840 --> 55:52.280
We and you can you can see date cart wrestling with this in the enlightenment and sort of failing we need

55:53.560 --> 55:55.160
intelligibility

55:55.160 --> 55:57.160
To be wedded to reality

55:57.880 --> 56:00.840
Right, the structures of intelligibility have to be

56:01.560 --> 56:05.320
Not identical to because that's impossible. You try idealism in that field

56:06.120 --> 56:08.520
I'm sorry. That was too fast for some people, but I'll just let that go

56:08.920 --> 56:13.560
But so I we the map has to correspond to the territory whether correspond

56:13.640 --> 56:15.640
It has to there has to be a conformity

56:15.640 --> 56:18.600
There has to be a contact and a wedding to them together

56:18.600 --> 56:22.680
There can't be a space between them like there's between map and territory because soon as there's a space

56:22.920 --> 56:27.000
There's what guarantees and what manages the space and at some point

56:27.400 --> 56:32.760
This is this is Taylor's point. You need a contact epistemology. No, right, right, right, right?

56:32.840 --> 56:35.560
So, you know, there's nothing you can do

56:36.600 --> 56:38.040
right

56:38.040 --> 56:44.440
That will show me or give me an argument for why intelligibility shall map should conform that way to reality

56:44.760 --> 56:48.920
Because what you'll do is right locked in right and this is what Plato saw

56:49.320 --> 56:54.520
Right, but what what Plato's basically saying is there is it's like if I can put it this way

56:54.520 --> 56:56.520
I'll try and put it in a way that's more narrative

56:58.120 --> 57:00.120
It's like there's a perpetual promise

57:00.520 --> 57:05.960
That intelligibility will track reality and that we find that to be inexhaustibly the case

57:06.360 --> 57:12.040
But there's no argument we can give that will ultimately explain that because every argument presupposes it

57:12.920 --> 57:18.040
Does that track as I'm I'm not sure why the last part of that is true

57:18.120 --> 57:19.640
Although I agree that it's true

57:19.640 --> 57:24.920
So and I and what's running around in the back of my head while you're laying that out is I think well in some sense

57:24.920 --> 57:29.800
That's the problem that evolution solves in a technical sense. So, you know, let's say

57:30.200 --> 57:32.680
A mosquito lays a million eggs in its lifetime

57:33.000 --> 57:38.520
And so that's a million mosquitoes whose epistemology better track ontology, but almost none of them do

57:39.000 --> 57:43.960
So they all die. Yes. And so that that that mapping I think

57:44.680 --> 57:47.960
Because it's philosophically important impossible in some sense

57:48.600 --> 57:49.720
I think that

57:49.720 --> 57:55.720
The process of evolution is actually what solves that and then our cognitive architecture emerges out of that evolve base

57:55.800 --> 58:03.640
And so it's taken 3.5 billion years to produce the solutions that we have to mapping intelligibility onto

58:03.800 --> 58:05.800
I totally agree with you about this. I agree

58:06.280 --> 58:11.000
So, let me agree and then tell you why I think it goes deeper. Yeah, okay. So just very quickly

58:11.560 --> 58:15.960
The the I think relevance realization basically does that same thing that evolution does

58:16.360 --> 58:21.400
It has this it's a self-organizing system in which you would introduce variation and then selection

58:21.560 --> 58:26.200
Your your attention is doing it right now. There's a there's a drive to open up mind wander vary

58:26.440 --> 58:31.320
And then there's and what you're doing is constantly evolving your fittedness your optimal gripping

58:31.880 --> 58:37.800
So towards some end, which is the dialogue of the conversation. Yes. Yeah, and whatever that's embedded in exactly. Yeah, right

58:38.040 --> 58:40.040
Yeah, so you're doing this

58:40.040 --> 58:43.640
Yeah, and there's a space of associations beside what you're doing

58:43.800 --> 58:47.240
But yeah, what I'm saying is evolution actually presupposes

58:47.640 --> 58:49.960
an ontology in which that

58:50.440 --> 58:56.760
Will work, right? Right. So that's right. Okay, right. Okay. So that you should have something to say

58:56.840 --> 59:00.040
But we talked about we've talked about that before like when we when we did that

59:00.760 --> 59:02.120
thing on Genesis

59:02.120 --> 59:05.720
And you talk about how it's this idea of a psychic projection

59:05.800 --> 59:12.200
But the idea that let's say you example could imagine that you could psychically project patterns and and and

59:12.600 --> 59:14.760
onto the world means that it presupposes that

59:15.720 --> 59:20.440
The same problem that means that those patterns are presupposed in the manner in which the world exists

59:20.520 --> 59:24.200
And that even be right in the historians of science. I've read who

59:25.160 --> 59:29.720
attempt to embed the development of science in a Judeo-Christian ethic by necessity

59:30.360 --> 59:35.880
Also, you know giving obeisance, let's say to the influence of the Enlightenment say that the

59:36.760 --> 59:38.760
notion that

59:39.080 --> 59:40.440
There was a logos

59:40.520 --> 59:47.320
There's an ontological logos as well as an epistemological logos was that precondition for the development of the scientific attitude

59:47.800 --> 59:53.400
And I think that's true. Yes. And I think and that's the that's the cornerstone of ancient epistemology

59:53.560 --> 59:58.680
You don't ask the question how from this the the workings of my mind till I get to the ontology

59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.120
You ask the question. Well, whatever knowledge there is presupposes intelligibility, right?

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:09.400
And then I asked I have to ask what must the world be like such that that intelligibility reliably exists

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:16.680
It's a very different orientation. That's for sure. Okay, so but let's take it that this is at least a plausible argument

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.200
the promise that intelligibility is wedded

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:21.960
to

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:22.920
reality

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:28.360
And there and that we can realize it through something like relevance realization cognitively or

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.640
Biologically adaptivity through evolution, right? That promise is continually made

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:37.640
But we can give no explanation for it because given what we've just said

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:41.560
Every attempt to explain it presupposes it as a fundamental thing

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:47.960
Okay, that seems just fine to me the fact that the promise is inexhaustibly kept

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.760
is the good

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:53.720
Hmm

01:00:53.720 --> 01:01:01.240
Is that the good that is referred to in genesis when god uses the the logos to derive habitable order out of chaos

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:06.040
Well says it is good. Is that the same idea? I hope so. I mean

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:10.840
For me, that's what playdough means when he talks about how the good is even beyond being

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.640
Because the good makes possible

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:19.560
The intelligibility of reality. Okay. Well, that's kind of what I'm trying to also drive out in this system of propositions

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:22.040
And that's what I meant and I hope you took it as a compliment what I said

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:24.360
I think this is a neoplatonic argument you're making

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.440
You're you're you're doing a lot of the similar moves. Okay. Now the thing I have is

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Right, so that's the good

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.920
And and then is there a way of and

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.600
Oh, you mean I think jonathan will have some important things to say

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:46.920
So that's like the a priori structure of being before there is there's actually beings. It's like there's it's there's an it's an

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:49.720
In this there's a there's a potential intelligibility

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.280
Even for the finite in relation to the infinite

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:57.480
Exactly because if and and what you can do is you can reject that fundamental goodness

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:00.440
And I and notice I can't give you an argument to get you back into it

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.760
But but if you reject that fundamental goodness, you will be you will be you and you you see dey karp wrestling with this

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.080
Because he tries to

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:15.240
He gets sort of stuck inside the kajato, right? And he's trying and and he's I think they're for you

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:18.040
Right and and and and he realizes. Oh

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:23.640
Oh, I could be trapped in solipsism and skepticism. And what does he do? He says, oh, no, no

01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:26.280
There must be a god that guarantees

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:31.000
That the intelligibility the clear and distinct ideas map onto reality

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:37.160
He realizes he needs something outside of the argument in order to guarantee that fundamental goodness

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.160
That makes everything else possible

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:42.840
But then what he does is he creates famously a circular argument for that god

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:47.480
And so he tries to make an argument for it, but he ends up presupposing the very thing

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:51.240
He's trying to prove this is what I mean by our apprehension of it

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:57.080
Is is not something that is produced inferentially it is an apprehension of a fundamental this fundamental goodness

01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:03.560
And I can't I can't give you an argument or an evidence or evidence for now. I think

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:09.720
I think ethical goodness is dependent on and reflective of at times exemplary of

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:12.920
That ontological of your la la mi goodness

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:19.640
And don't you think that that's the reason why in so many traditions the infinite is always referred to negatively like the whole notion of

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:24.360
Negative theology or oh, that's interesting say more well the idea that that

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:31.160
If you want to express that which is which is the source of being you end up having it almost and it empties itself

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:33.480
Yes, it is empties itself of all characteristics

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:38.040
While recognizing that it is at the same time this the summation of all characters

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:42.280
It's like the good ultimately is that which everything is culminating to and then

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:49.160
It's a kind of giving away into something which is always more and you think that's related to that a prior acceptance of

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:52.280
the of the existence of the relationship between

01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:00.280
Intelligence and and being well that it's that that that this thing that guarantees that has the is being pointed at too

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:03.720
By these processes. I think so. I've been thinking about I've been thinking

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.840
I don't know I can take you on this this experiment that I've talked about

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:12.040
This idea that that identity is kinetic that identity always kind of empties itself into more

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:18.040
So I you always use the example of an object like you have a it's like you have a cup and then you have you have

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:21.080
So certain level you have different aspects of the cup

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:25.640
So in order for it to reach it's good all these elements in order for them to reach it's good

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.840
They have to kind of they have to give themselves into something which

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:31.880
Cannot be found at the level of their elements

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:37.560
So so what you end up having is you have hierarchies of beings that that are moving towards that identity

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:40.520
But as they reach their highest point they actually empty themselves

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:45.800
Into the higher identity and then you move up and then you end up with something that is beyond being ultimately

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:51.560
Okay, so let me try something to you because that might start to sow the good and the true and the beautiful together

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:53.720
I've been doing a lot on

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:57.800
Marrying Maro Ponti with Plato and John Roots and other people are doing this

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:01.000
I will but here like the that thing you just pointed out so

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:05.160
Maro Ponti's point is you never you can never completely see any object

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:09.880
So let's just talk because the number of right or the number of just even

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:13.720
Uh perceptual aspects is which is what the castle was doing

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:16.920
Yeah, yeah, right and then of course then there's the imaginal aspects

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:21.000
I can also all the functions that are implicit in this all the use like right

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:25.560
And then so one of the things I've been arguing is is that if you take a look at Plato the

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:28.920
Eidos I originally meant the look of a thing, but he didn't mean the look

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:33.320
He meant something like the aspect and here's here's what the like so

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:38.040
You have all of these aspects and they're unfolding inexhaustibly

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:43.240
There's a through but they don't unfold chaotically. There is a coherent through line that runs through them

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:50.120
Right you get a sense of as you said the identity, but here's the thing that through line is not itself an aspect

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:57.160
It can't be because if you you're making a fundamental it's an a priori necessity right and it runs through it

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.000
but notice how

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
right first of all that's starting to get us into

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:07.720
Not right a sense of the goodness because that's the promise being kept the through line is the promise being kept

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:12.120
It's also a different notion of truth. This is something I want to talk about later if we get a chance

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:16.760
Truth is this as ala Thea as disclosure rather than as correspondence

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.120
But notice first of all how that corresponds to beauty and think about what Tammy's doing with the paintings

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:29.240
She's right because she's she's don't step don't stop at this one aspect as the appearance

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:34.440
But open it up open up all and see and fulfill the promise

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.440
The aspects even in something horrible. Yes. Yes, that's dependent on your willingness to gaze

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:46.040
Which is the story of exodus and and the bronze serpent. Well, and I would say the crucifixion as well

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:49.960
That's really interesting because hawn talks about we've lost the ability to linger

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:52.680
With things and that's why we can no longer

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:57.800
You know if chimps if chimps are in the jungle and they come across a decent sized snake

01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:59.800
They'll stand at a distance from it

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:04.840
But they will gaze at it for up to 24 hours and they have a particular cry

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:10.520
Which which is a snake ra that's the name of the cry which they utter that brings other chimps

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:15.720
And so they hate snakes right in innately do you show a rubber snake to a chimp that's never seen one?

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:19.960
He'll hit the ceiling but then he'll look and so they're out there gazing on the snake

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:25.240
It's part of they're fascinated by it despite the fact that it's also simultaneously threatening. Yes

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:29.800
So I think that there's increasing evidence for for something like awe

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:33.720
It's awe definitely well, that's manifest in pilo erection in animals

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:39.960
Okay, but think about what awe does awe is a kind of love and all the things awe does which is really interesting

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:45.320
It's one of the few instances where people reliably report a sense of the shrinkage of the self

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:49.800
That is nevertheless as a positive element to it. Yeah, even though they're terrified

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:53.560
Yeah, they want to they want to follow it through they want to go into

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:59.960
Well, I think that's partly so imagine this so so imagine awe imagine pilo erection now

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:05.480
So a cat puffs up and you know, that's the hair standing up in the back of your neck. Oh, it's the same instinct. It is

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:13.080
Yeah, and I'm doing work on this with a student of mine right now and and how we've exacted the pilo erection into aesthetic

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:15.640
Yeah experience, right. Okay. So imagine this now

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:21.640
You're out you look at the night sky and it's it's awe inspired and so there's also a call to imitate there

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:26.680
So you see the image of mary for example with her foot on the serpent and her head in the stars

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:31.240
Well, she's looking at the stars and she's so that's the cosmic realm. It's the infinite and now

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.800
She's awe struck by that vision

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:38.200
And then she in order to adapt to that vision of the infinite

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:44.200
You have to imitate that which instills the awe and that's represented by her foot on the serpent. Oh, that's cool

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:50.200
Yes, that's for sure. That's why you know, there's there's literally hundreds of Renaissance images of that

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:52.520
mary head in the stars

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:58.520
Foot on the serpent and I thought I've been thinking through this awe issue for and it has this interesting association with beauty

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:00.280
But you can imagine that

01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:04.440
When a cat dances sideways and pilo erect. It's trying to look larger

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:09.800
It's trying to look as if it can overcome the predator. Well, that's what awe does to us is that when we've

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:16.040
Historically evolutionarily what we did when we felt awe in the face of a predator is we

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:23.320
We felt compelled to imitate the predator so that we could become ferocious enough to overcome the predator

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:29.160
And so that's that call to an expanded being that you would associate for example with development of the shadow

01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:34.200
It's like when you look at something brutal, you know, that really terrifies you

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:36.040
It has to call that

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:39.560
Capacity for predatory behavior out of that monstrous capacity

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:43.080
Now it should be integrated into the kind of ethic that we're describing

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:45.240
But you're not good if you're harmless

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:50.920
It's way more than that and that awe in the face of what's catastrophic is a call to be

01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:56.680
More than the catastrophic thing which certainly makes you monstrous in a sense. Well, that's not really interesting

01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.560
because

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:01.320
I mean, it's also

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.320
It also produces

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.760
sort of increased

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:05.960
Seeking of others

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:09.720
Which makes sense because one of the ways we can make ourselves band together band together

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:14.440
And then and then that seems to get exacted into right

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:16.920
I don't have to be big

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:21.880
But I can connect or participate in something right right and then you get reverence

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:26.760
As opposed to just raw awe. What's really interesting just to supplement your argument

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:29.320
And this is work. I'm doing with song you chin

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:36.280
If you like they have a they have a device now that will actually cause people to have chills the chills up and down

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:39.560
This line run cold water up and down in the right way

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:43.720
What you do and what you can do is you can really enhance people's aesthetic experience

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:47.240
But even more basically you get people to listen to like to the same

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:50.840
Passage of music and you put one group of people in a slightly cooler room

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:56.760
They will have a more powerful aesthetic experience because it facilitates pilo erection. Exactly. That's so cool

01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:01.640
Yeah, I was so thrilled about this notion of pilo erection being associated with the instinct to imitate

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.640
You know to put those two things together

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:08.440
It's like well, what do you do in the face of the predator? Well, one is run away. The other is

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:12.600
Become superordinate to the predator and then you might say well

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:17.240
What's the worst possible predator which I think is part of the Judeo-Christian narrative because we're trying to

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:23.640
Because the snake in the garden is satan. It's like well. What's the worst predator? It's not the snake bad as snakes are

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.520
It's like a super snake. It's a meta snake

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:31.720
It's the sum total of everything that threatens you and so that calls you to be more than that

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:35.000
Whatever that is. I don't know a lot about the biology but biology

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.200
But do the do animals experience this pilo erection?

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:42.520
in with let's say a member of their own species that is bigger or more

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:48.760
Dominating sure. Yes, they do sure and we also have some preliminary and it's ethnographic

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:54.760
So you have to be careful with it that they do something that looks like awe you'll get a monkey

01:11:55.080 --> 01:12:00.920
You've got the snake thing but there's also a video like of a macaque monkey and it's goes out onto a precipice

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:06.440
Which is a little bit dangerous. Uh-huh to watch the sunrise not doing anything. Uh-huh just sits there

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:11.560
Well, you know monkeys will look longer if you show them photos of of their troop

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:14.920
They gaze longer at the high status individuals as well

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:19.080
And if they are encountering a high status individual who could take them out in some sense

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:24.680
But not merely as an expression of power as the primatologists insist then they do show

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:27.800
Pilo erection in response to the threat from the superior

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:32.520
But they're also fascinated by it and you can imagine that part of that fascination is

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:37.800
The locking of their attention onto what they could become right because that's what at least at least that it

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:43.080
Interests me more in the sense of beauty, right? Yes, where it's it is this sense of

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:50.200
Shrinking in front of something in the sense feeling that you're smaller than that and then this desire to move into it

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:55.160
Or contact imitation as a kind of internalization a kind of being wetting yourself to someone

01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:59.160
Yeah, and to form a worship a primary form of worship, right because you

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:03.800
You worship what you you imitate what you worship. They're the same thing

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:10.120
So, okay. Well, that was fun. So shall we move to the next one? I think so. I mean, I'm getting a sense of

01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:14.920
How the true the good and the beautiful could be potentially integrated

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:21.800
Because I think that's a necessary requirement for this argument and notice how we are moving outside of we didn't talk about true

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:27.560
We can talk about that later. Yeah, we're moving outside of sort of standard ways of talking about

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:35.160
At least goodness and beauty here. I think there's similar ways of doing a truth that could actually get us back to something that

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:38.840
Yeah, well, it's nice to put the dot biological twist on it too

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.920
I'd wanted to run one thing before we move on which is that the way that I tend to think about it in terms of

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:46.920
um

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:50.360
When we talked about the idea of the through line. Yes, I think that's the idos

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:56.280
I think that's what the form is in play dough. Well, it isn't it isn't what Aristotle thought it was. It isn't just a specificity

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:58.600
Right of necessary and sufficient conditions

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:03.720
So would you feel comfortable with the notion that it's the manner in which the multiplicity is gathered?

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:08.840
It's the logos, right? And so it actually gathers multiplicity. Don't listen to my words

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:12.920
Listen to the logos that gathers them together. All things are one, right? Heraclitus

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.400
Well, so then what we would presume

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:19.640
Visionally is that the thing that unites the true the good and the beautiful is the logos now

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:23.400
We shouldn't make the presumption of knowing that we understand what that logos is

01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:28.680
We've got some hints about what it is, but we can't characterize it entirely. Is that a reasonable

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:32.760
Proposition in your estimation. I think so. I think uh

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:34.920
in

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:38.840
Especially if we're careful to do what you did before which is we have

01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:40.920
um

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:45.000
We have a dipolar way of invoking the logos the logos is both

01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.400
the gathering

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:51.240
All right, the throughlining if I can put it that way, but it is also

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:53.960
right, right

01:14:53.960 --> 01:15:00.520
It is also the ontological reality that affords that happening. It's it's the fact that I can't exhaust it

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:05.560
Right, no matter how far I push it. So whatever through line I have is at most

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.160
um

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:10.920
A signification or a symbol of the fact that it's inexhaustible

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:14.280
Did that make sense what I'm trying to say? What do you know?

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:20.360
I'm not trying to understand that that the through line is the the significance that inexhaustible

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:24.440
In the manner in which it points up or in the manner in which it

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
inexhaustible like this or inexhaustible

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:33.640
The manner in which it's the fact that that intelligibility between between representation and actuality

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:36.680
Remains regardless of how okay how far you push it

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:40.120
So that would sort of be like the notion that the universe is logical

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:44.680
Logo space essentially, but and that there's that we're not going to run out of that

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:48.280
But it's not going to be logical in the modern sense right of a complete system

01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:53.560
Even though go to you can't reduce it to an algorithm exactly exactly so the see this is what I mean by saying

01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:56.600
I don't think of the form as

01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:04.440
Like a standard Aristotelian essence at least how it's been taught. Yeah to me which is a set of necessary and sufficient conditions

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:09.160
Like the low like there's no be there's no becoming in that is there there's just being

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:11.880
well because becoming implies

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:16.440
transformation of something that's algorithmic but in a but in a manner that's not

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:21.400
That doesn't escape from the logos and I mean, I think that's how reality constitutes itself

01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:25.480
And that's probably that's part of the solution to the scandal of induction

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:30.200
It's like no you can't predict with 100 percent certainty what's going to happen next

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:31.880
but

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:39.480
What will happen next despite its unpredictability like the next note in a symphony is still predictable exactly. This is what I mean about the good

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:45.320
The reason why Hume couldn't deal with the problem of induction is it requires the apprehension of the good

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:49.480
Which is the promise that this is not going to be logical identity

01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:52.840
But nevertheless it is going to be inexhaustibly coherent

01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:55.640
It's going to remain beautiful and in that in that sense

01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:57.240
It's always going to be

01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:01.160
Something right to which so it's not algorithm. It's not reducible to an algorithm

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:05.320
But that doesn't mean what you said it that doesn't mean it's not habitable. It doesn't mean it's not good

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:08.280
It doesn't mean it's not coherent exactly right

01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:16.280
And your example the the music which john russen used the musicality of intelligibility as I think the best way to think about

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:20.520
Yeah, I think so too. I think that's actually I actually think that's why we like music

01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:23.400
Yes, because I think that music is actually the most

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:28.600
Representational art form because for a variety of reasons first of all, we don't see objects

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.320
We see patterns and we interpret some patterns as objects

01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:36.200
So patterns are primary then we're looking for the harmonious interplay of patterns and then it's not

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:41.400
It's not strictly a causal relationship because the music is governed by principles

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:47.720
But it's not formally predictable. Otherwise it gets boring. Exactly, right? So you see that I think most particularly early

01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:50.280
I've I've experienced that most particularly with box

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:53.560
Brandenburg concertos which have this amazing

01:17:54.760 --> 01:18:00.280
Continual unfolding that's so logical. It almost appears mathematical and yet it's unpredictable

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:05.160
And you don't know where it's going to go and it goes there and you think man that just that's just right

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:10.600
So yeah, and so you could say that you could say that about pretty much everything that exists

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:13.720
That is that you know, I like the glass because it's just easy

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:18.920
So so the the idea is that there is a through line in this glass and but the through line

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:21.720
Goes through potentiality, which is indefinite

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:25.800
It is I can encounter a million glasses in my life and they will all be different

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:31.160
That's like the realm of musical possibility. Exactly. It's all but they all end up being predictable to a certain extent once I

01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:34.360
Grasp it like when I see the glass I recognize it

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:39.720
But I couldn't have predicted that this is the glass that would exist. There's a there's a kind of potentiality which

01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:44.840
Which is maintained within the identity of the glass, but it's not it's inexhaustible

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:49.240
Right. And when you see that when you apprehend that and this is scarry's point

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:51.000
This is

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:56.520
Being struck by beauty you see the tree and it's somehow it's like every other tree you've seen and yet it's not

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.560
It reminds you of the idos it reminds you of just what you said

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:06.920
And that's love I think that that's love too like in love in the sense that I've often said love is

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:10.040
The capacity for unity and multiplicity to exist

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:13.400
That's what love is. Right. That is that I

01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:18.120
I recognize something of you that we have in common

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:23.240
But I also recognize you're completely separate from me and that is and both are values

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:26.040
Those both have to coexist for love to be real. It has to be

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:32.760
separation well to give the devil is due you know, I would say that's the kernel of good that the diversity types are pushing

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:36.760
You know, we need to recognize the utility of multiplicity. It's like fair enough

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:42.600
The the problem with that a problem with that is well, yeah, but what's where's the unity here?

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:47.160
Where's the unity? It's all diversity. It can't be all diversity because then all we do we're in conflict

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:49.800
so and we we tend to have a

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:53.960
We tend to be the modern world had tends towards radical they tend to want to radical

01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:58.840
change unity to uniformity and then have this kind of crazy

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:07.160
Exploded multiplicity whereas the real this kind of natural relationship between between otherness is

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:09.160
exactly this

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:10.600
both recognizing

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:15.880
What we have in common and at the same time being kind of fascinated and attracted to that which we have

01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:22.440
Well, you think about the reason this conversation works is because we have grounds for commonality in our understanding

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:29.000
But that would be sterile without the multiplicity because we would just run over the same territory

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.720
And so, you know, we hope we aim towards the same thing enough so that we can communicate

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:35.800
but I wouldn't like it at all if

01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:41.800
You didn't each of you didn't bring something to bear on the discussion that i'm incapable of bringing to bear on it

01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:45.240
so the the last thing I want to bring up is of course, I mean

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:49.320
People are gonna say i'm jesus muggling but there's that's that's the

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:53.720
That's the the reason one of the reasons are where we can understand that in christianity

01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:59.480
The trinity is seen as the infinite is the image of the infinite that we have is

01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:05.640
Is a contradictory possibility of absolute unity and absolute multiplicity

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:12.680
And so we we just throw those two up at the same time and we say the infinite is absolutely multiple and absolutely one

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:16.760
And you cannot without contradiction and you cannot totally

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:21.160
That you can't reconcile that completely because that is ultimately

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:27.720
The it's a problem which practically appears everywhere anyways because everything is always

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:30.680
Everything in the world has something in common with everything else

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:37.400
You know, you know, if it's just being itself, but it it also necessarily must be different for the difference to

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:43.160
Goodman argument every object is infinitely some similar and right and right which is

01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:49.160
Restatement of the problem of perception itself. Yes, like well, you've seen a glass. Yes, but you haven't seen this glass

01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:53.240
Well, how much difference is there is well, there's an infinite number of differences as it turns out

01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:56.920
All right, so this is a this is a this is quite a switch here

01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:59.240
And I think this is a radical

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:01.560
uh proposition

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:08.040
That maybe not because once you hear it you think well, yes, and then you think well that's self evidence like yeah, well

01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:13.240
Not so not so quick here the description of a structure of values or an ethic

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:16.440
Subject to the code of sales that we've already added

01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:23.080
Or set of priorities is a narrative. So the description of a system of

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:27.720
Perceptual prioritizations and actions is a narrative

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.680
What do you think the description that could be it could also be representation in image

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:36.040
It wouldn't have to be a verbal not a grant a imagistic or verbal description

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:42.520
That is what we regard as a narrative. So this is what I I wanted to again challenge you on

01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:46.840
And it sort of overlaps with the discussion we've having about the true and the good and the beautiful

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:49.320
because I think there are

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:55.640
Three three different dimensions by which we organize intelligibility

01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:59.400
So there's a narrative

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:04.520
The example I use is video games and and there's a reason why people are doing the virtual exodus

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:09.400
They're preferring video games over with the real world because of the dimensions that are found in video games

01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:13.800
So one is a narrative and the narrative they belong to clearly. That's one of the things so

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:20.360
Total agreement that there's two other features that are deeply meaningful to them not

01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:25.480
Semantic but meaning in life meaningful right one is a nomological order

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:30.600
There's a set of rules that they understand that makes sense of that world

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:34.920
So that they can move around in that world with confidence

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:38.360
Because if they have a narrative, but it doesn't it isn't undergirded by an

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.560
Okay, is that a reflection in the video game of the same through line and

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:50.200
And mapping of intelligibility onto ontology within the that's what I think the nomological but it's a simpler world

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:53.560
Yes, so they can establish that first. So you're saying

01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:57.160
Okay, so it's a slightly different argument

01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:00.200
Perhaps because I said well a narrative is a description of an ethic

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:02.760
And you say there's more than

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:06.920
There's more ways that the world needs to be apprehended than the purely narrative

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:08.120
And I think that's fine

01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:13.400
But does that bear on the argument that the description of an ethic is a narrative?

01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:16.040
No, because we also describe other ways in which we

01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:18.200
prioritize

01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:24.200
Our perceptions in things that aren't narratives that are nomological. That's what we call a scientific theory

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:27.640
The theory of evolution right is not it is not a narrative

01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:35.560
It's a description of the way things unfold or let's they say newton's laws newton's laws are not narrative in any fashion

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:39.000
But do you think okay? So let me push back on that fair enough fair enough

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:43.000
And then you could say well a set of mathematical axioms and and the

01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:46.680
Operations that are derived from the axioms is also not a narrative

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:52.360
But so and fair enough. So then I would say and this will get us into discussion about science later

01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:58.600
Is the intelligibility and the attraction of those non narrative descriptions of the world

01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:01.560
dependent on their being

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:05.800
nested inside a narrative, but see and so here's where I'm going to answer you back

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:10.840
I'm going to say they mutually they reciprocally require each other just like what we were doing with the truth

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:13.480
Okay, okay, so that that then okay fine

01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:18.120
So so is that the same thing as narrative and the scientific description mutually requiring each other right?

01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:21.160
But you can't reduce the one to the either to the

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:26.440
You can't okay one you can't reduce the nomological to the narrative or the narrative to the nomological

01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:31.080
That's why that's what I was trying to get at three dimensions almost like a cartesian graph with three dimensions

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:35.640
Right, okay, you can't reduce if I remove right because I suppose if you do that too

01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:39.560
You run into the postmodern trap, which is that there's nothing but the narrative intelligibility

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:43.320
There's nothing but the narrative there has to yes, and there also has to be something

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:49.080
There has to be a space within which we can compare narratives move between narratives and

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:53.960
Learn narratives right and there and there has to be something that allows us to override narrative bias

01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:57.960
You know the research on narrative bias. It's powerful. It's one of our most powerful bias

01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:01.400
There has to be something that can kick us out of the narrative bias

01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:04.760
but I think okay the way that that's the way that I would phrase it is

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:07.400
myself is that

01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:13.080
The reason why we tend to think or like even the way that I presented is that the priority of narrative is because

01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:20.680
Narrative is the embodied manner in which we engage with a structural value. That is it's the way that we engage in a structural value

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:23.080
and so because because we

01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:29.480
See a disc and usually it has a narrative that embodied pattern is a description of the embodied pattern

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:34.280
I think that it I think that it's because I don't know if it's a story if you acted out

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:36.200
I don't know if it's a story

01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:41.960
Until it's a representation of a pattern of action because otherwise it's it's more like a pattern of behavior

01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:46.520
You know like so for example imagine you watched wolves interacting. Yeah, you could say well

01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:49.960
It's as if they're following the following narrative rules

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:55.480
But they're not because they don't have it's not narrative. It's a pattern in their behavior

01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:57.640
right, but for the same reason that

01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:03.400
That it's the through line like for the same reason that you can't see the glass from the elements of the glass

01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:09.080
It doesn't mean that the glassness like the identity of the glass has a causal relationship to its

01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:13.400
element it's just not a call it's not that a mechanical causal relationship

01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:15.080
It's a the causal of identity

01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:21.640
It's it and so the the narrative or let's say the pattern of behavior is causal from above you could say

01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:26.360
Because it's that the way in which you recognize that the behavior is a pattern in the first place

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:28.520
Okay, I want to push back on all right. No, you have to

01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:33.400
This is one of the areas where we we kind of don't totally agree. Yeah, but that's good because

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:39.960
Well, this is a real mystery this problem because it is the relationship between science and the narrative of meaning

01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:45.480
It's a relationship between ontology and epistemology or between description and value

01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:49.240
I mean, so it's no wonder that this is causing, you know, a little bit of trouble

01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:51.400
I want to throw in one more dimension

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:55.800
Which is right, which is you could also level up in the game

01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:02.520
There's a way in there. There's a dimension that's not a narrative. It's it's an act of self-transcendence, right?

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:06.360
I call that I thought about as a meta key that you can scale

01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:12.840
That has to be that's quidditch. By the way, that's what rolling represented with quidditch because there's a game and a meta game

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:18.680
If you win the meta game, you also win the game, right? Okay, but not vice versa, which is very it's so smart

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:23.640
So sorry you you do this turn you'll just throw these observations that are like

01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:26.120
What's even worse than that?

01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:30.920
I think that the quidditch players are chasing is the round ks of lkma that

01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:35.960
It contains all the potential of the world, right? And it's also the spirit of mercury. I like it's like

01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:41.000
I don't know how she did that. It's just beyond belief that she managed that. I don't I really don't

01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:47.640
It's like if you get if you the way to understand it like in terms of a glass would be like once you grasp the logos

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:50.920
This is the st. Maximus way of speaking too once you grasp the logos

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:55.880
Then you you are able to you've captured all the rules and everything else

01:28:56.200 --> 01:29:01.640
And once you understand what a glass is then you don't have to you can recognize every glass in the entire world

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:03.160
It's like it's such a massive power

01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:07.000
You overcome the entire game through getting this one thing which is like

01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:11.800
Which is often the image as a seed or as a golden ball or as something sparkling

01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:19.240
Which is which you represent like in the world, but it's ultimately pointing above it or well, that's part perhaps that's a

01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:25.080
Reflected in the insistence that adam is to name all the animals

01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:31.160
Right in in in the in the story of adam and eve because that's obviously kept in the narrative for a reason

01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:33.160
And it has to do with the power that

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:40.120
Naming and sub doing in the sense that you've described which is the also simultaneous imposition of a hierarchy of

01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:44.200
categorization that goes along with naming that gives you a grip on the world

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:48.440
And that that grip is associated with the moral necessity and requirement in that story

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:52.600
It's for me the nomological dimension is the naming dimension

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.600
That's what science does

01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:57.640
Broadly construed and that's different from telling a story

01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:04.840
Naming things is different from telling a story. So but ultimately this is where this is where I kind of come back again to the

01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:05.800
We're gonna we'll take you

01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:10.280
We have to not go too far to this because we've been through this from down this path before but

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.920
so ultimately because

01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:16.440
We are not disembodied beings like this is so science

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:19.400
This type of nomological order

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:22.040
Is taken from a position where I am

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:28.120
As I see the nomological order I have to climb the yes the ladder and so and

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:32.520
Especially most narratives always have a sense of this is moses on the mountain again

01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:37.880
Yes, yes, but there's also there's that's why the narrative is always this like almost all narratives are that it's

01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:42.600
You notice the difference and once you you notice the distance and when you notice the distance

01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:45.240
Then you have to reestablish a connection with that

01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:50.360
With which you're distant because you don't need an ethic unless you notice the difference

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:54.120
You just I mean you don't need at least you don't need an explicit ethic

01:30:54.120 --> 01:31:01.480
You don't have to why why not unless you notice the difference because you don't have to tell someone how to go downstairs unless they can't do it

01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:06.840
You're going you don't you don't have a you don't have an explicit set of rules

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:09.560
Okay, so there has to be a there has to be an objection

01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:13.480
There has to be a problem so st. Paul says something like okay the law is written on the human heart

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:15.880
Which means that it doesn't mean all the laws are written

01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:18.440
Extensively in every detail in the human heart

01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:25.480
It's like no that is in the human heart in that in that little golden ball in that center in that place where everything comes together you have

01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:30.200
Contain all the potentiality everything that has the through line is contained in that

01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:32.600
But now if you notice the difference

01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:37.000
Then you have to formulate that difference and then that becomes the laws

01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:41.080
Or just the ways of being so I can say something at first like

01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:45.560
When you're driving a car like there's specific laws and then a problem comes up

01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:46.440
It's like oh well

01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:49.960
Actually, there's a differentiation here, which we have to make or else there's a problem right

01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:53.880
Which means the ethic that's currently keeps getting more and more detail and more and more

01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:57.320
So you start with the law you end up with like this in Jewish tradition

01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:01.800
You end up with this huge compendium of exceptions and like details and everything

01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:05.480
But ultimately the idea is that all of that is ultimately contained in the

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:11.160
Something which gathers it all together into one into this ineffable point that transcends

01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:15.960
I might have followed this but but but the space in which all the laws are being made and written

01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:18.360
That's not a narrative space

01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:20.360
Right

01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:25.320
Let me go after you on that for a minute. The Ten Commandments is not a story because no, I don't think that's true

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:31.000
You think that I think it is a story. That's why christ when christ so he okay, that's a good entry point

01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:34.920
That's a good entry point. Well because the story which reveals the Ten Commandments, right?

01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:39.480
Okay, but there's also a story in it aren't this aren't I believe that yeah, there is a little bit

01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:41.160
But I think they're you're right

01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:47.320
But why this is why we say that the Ten Commandments is embedded in a story without the story of the israelites leaving

01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:54.200
Leaving egypt finding themselves in the desert of of of nothingness having to reconnect with the transcendent

01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:57.720
That is why the law exists. So the nomological

01:32:58.440 --> 01:32:59.480
order

01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:04.120
Is embedded in the story you wouldn't have to but the reverse is also the case

01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:09.080
Go ahead. Go ahead if there isn't if god doesn't offer us the nomological order

01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:11.800
There's no point for the exodus in the story, right?

01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:17.080
Right, that's okay. We could we could hypothesize that it comes up from the bottom and down from the top

01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:21.480
No, no, this is this is even before that right. We're trying to talk about

01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:28.600
Like I'm proposing that the narrative and the nomological and whatever we want to call this self transcending dimension

01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:33.560
Are irreducible to each other they're not neither none of them can exist independent

01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:39.640
That's why I'm using the three dimensions. Yeah metaphor. Yeah, right. They are interdependent, but they're not they're not reducible

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:45.160
So I'm resisting I would say the the ontology is is not captured inside

01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:47.960
epistemology because

01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:53.080
Epistemology cannot reach to the full extent of the multiplicity of ontology

01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:56.280
So, okay, so now why is that relevant to what you just said?

01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:00.680
That's part of the irreducibility you're arguing. I think in some sense that

01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:05.400
No matter what the story is there's something that's real that's beyond that story

01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:09.560
Is that okay? Okay. So so let me put a couple of twists in that got it

01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:13.720
Is that okay for you Jonathan right now? No, I think it's fine. We'll keep going. Okay. Okay

01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:19.320
So you said there's no story in it in the 10 commandments, right and Jonathan had one objection

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:23.800
I have a different take on that that that he may appreciate maybe maybe you too

01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:28.200
When the Pharisees so the Pharisees and the scribes are always trying to

01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:34.360
Trap Christ in the gospels into making a heretical statement or doing something that clearly violates the law

01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:37.080
So they call them on healing on the Sabbath for example

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:40.440
And there's like 10 stories like that where smart people

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:46.600
Who run on algorithms try to trap them and it never works because he does the thing you described

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:52.120
Which is he just refers to a higher order principle or even three levels up and says like no

01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:56.120
Yes, but one of the things that happens is the Pharisees come and say

01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:03.800
Well, here's the decalogue which is the most important law and the trick there is no matter what he says

01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:10.120
He says the others are less important and so now he's a heretic and and they get to take him away and he says

01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:15.160
Put God above all else

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:18.120
And love your neighbor as yourself

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:19.400
Mm-hmm

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:23.160
It's all of the laws are derived from that spirit

01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:29.080
And that spirit is that spirit is a story and that story is the logos

01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:36.120
And so that's the move that I don't I slow it down, Jordan. Okay, I get that's the spirit

01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:41.400
I totally get that well then the question is what is the spirit? But why is the spirit necessarily a story?

01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:44.840
Well, I don't know why it's necessarily a story

01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:52.760
But I know that it's necessarily a story in that context because the spirit that christ is referring to that unites the decalogue

01:35:53.320 --> 01:36:00.200
Is the logos and the whole biblical corpus the narrative that stem that spans the entire biblical corpus

01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:01.960
is the

01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:05.480
account of the elaboration of that spirit across time and it's

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:13.160
embodied incarnation and that presents itself as a story and so and I think the reason for that is that it just

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:19.240
Okay, so so I mean I get I get I understand your point. I understand the point that you're making now and so

01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:23.320
I'm actually understanding your point better than I've ever suggested it before

01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:29.240
Well, you're talking about that that which transcends the current narrative and that has to be there. There's no reality

01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:30.440
so

01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:31.720
Okay, let's

01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:33.720
Let's leave that for for a moment

01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:37.480
I just want to maybe one more thing because I think it's important. Sorry. No, no, that's fine

01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:38.920
I think we're at a key moment

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.320
So we are so one of the things that that that we've been discussing and this has been coming back over and over is that

01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:49.400
So let's say that we understand that there is a certain type of equivalence and two functions for

01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:52.840
Anomological order like a hierarchy that's presented

01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:58.120
You know like just a series of categories which are related in embedded structure, right?

01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:00.280
And I see science committed to that. Okay

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.880
And that this also coexist for sure in scripture

01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:07.000
That's what we're seeing is like it actually it coexist together

01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:10.520
Yeah, you have the story of the israeli the bible and then you have these series of laws

01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:14.520
Which is actually not just n it's a lot a lot a lot of laws, right?

01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:16.520
So you have all these laws and so

01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:22.200
But one of the things that you've said several times is that you you want to you feel like the solution

01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:28.760
To the meaning crisis. Yes, does it need narrative or that narrative shouldn't be part of the solution?

01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:31.960
And so I think that if those two are

01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:38.360
Both have their function, I'd say why is it that you want to remove one and keep the other? Oh, okay?

01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:43.800
That's an excellent question. This is something sam harris struggles with too by the way. No, I'm dead serious about that

01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:45.960
I'm dead serious about that. So

01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:52.440
Let me answer this really carefully and uh, tell me if we're getting too far afield from the main discussion

01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:54.680
Okay, so I'm going to depend on both of you

01:37:55.160 --> 01:38:01.160
My argument is the nomological order that one of the problems in the meaning crisis is the nomological order that we have

01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:08.680
Is no longer in any way relatable to or wet can be wedded to a narrative because the nomological order we have

01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:11.240
Right is that there it

01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:16.520
So what used to bridge between the nomological order and the narrative order is teleology

01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:21.640
So teleology says the nomological order is ordered, but it's ordered in this way

01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:28.600
And the teleology has this structure and then narrative says, oh, I can glum onto I can I can

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.320
Conform to a teleological order because stories are inherently teleological

01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:37.480
But they're different from just a teleology just telling a teleology isn't a story

01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:45.000
But stories can attach to teleology. Is that why is why is describing a teleology not a story?

01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:48.760
Because you could describe it

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.360
I think that's you could describe the cup but then the problem is as well

01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:55.960
Can you describe the top cup in the absence of a narrative?

01:38:56.120 --> 01:39:00.120
And I mean, I think part of the argument I'm trying to make in this. So this is our key

01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:03.560
Disagreement in some sense is I don't think you can okay

01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:08.200
And so well, let's be really careful because we might we might also be engaged in in semantic drift

01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:10.920
So I I'm trying to limit

01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:13.080
We can trivialize what we mean by narrative

01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:18.680
And we they need a description of a series of events is a narrative. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. No. No, I don't want to do that

01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:23.880
I get your point. No, no, we don't want to we don't want to widen the words so much that the argument

01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:25.320
Though but

01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:32.120
Wait a minute. No, no, I would I would actually object to that because any descriptions of events that I can conceive as being one

01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:37.880
Is has to have some kind of narrative structure. Otherwise, we have the other one. We have the same problem of

01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:40.760
of multiplicity and

01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:47.880
And combinatorial if I can recognize that events connect together that that means that you would you have to not metaphorically

01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:50.760
I actually no, I agree with that. But not but let me challenge it

01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:56.360
Unfortunately, but and I'm not speaking metaphorically here because if I'm speaking metaphorically, we're just golfing another thing

01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:58.600
That means that music has a narrative

01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:05.400
Because it has a melody you're saying a melody is a narrative and that strikes me as a very

01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:09.640
Improper thing to say that. Okay. That's a tough one man. Yeah, because

01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:12.680
Then you have to start to wrestle with

01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:15.240
Well, what do you mean by music?

01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:20.120
Because you could say that the the sequence of the notes in and of itself

01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:24.920
May not have a narrative although I'm not certain of that but you could say that because

01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:28.120
But then the question is

01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:33.960
When you're listening to the music and it has the effect that you regard as music on you

01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:39.560
How much of that effect including the aesthetic is a consequence of a narrative?

01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:43.640
So I would say well when you say music, how sure are you that what you're saying is

01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:48.120
That's nothing but the relationship of the notes to one another. I agree. That's a good point

01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:53.560
Because there's no embodiment in that right right and there's a sense in which music is neither subjective or objective

01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:56.920
Right like beauty. Yes. Yes. It has to have something

01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:05.320
That is at least analogous to to narrative because in order for you to recognize and and it's funny because the modern's tried to go away from

01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:07.320
Yeah, you understand the modern's really tried to break it

01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:10.040
But there was in in in any traditional society

01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:15.640
There are tropes of music which help you understand when something's beginning when something's ending

01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:19.560
And you can map them on to narrative very directly because that's what happens

01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:26.120
Slide you because if you give me them you say oh when I'm going to send you a narrative to mirror to melody

01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:31.720
Then I'll say here's a logical argument and there's a progression and a through line from the premises to the conclusion. Is that a narrative?

01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:40.120
Well, that's a tough one right because because the the fact that you selected out those those okay

01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:43.000
Here's something I've been thinking about

01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:45.640
I'm going to take a slight detour but go right back to the point

01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:51.720
So I I thought about this more when I was talking to Richard Dawkins because I think Dawkins is a good faith player

01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:55.640
And I think he believes he's a real scientist and he believes that the truth will set you free

01:41:55.720 --> 01:42:00.680
Which scientists have to believe to be scientists because they cannot be scientists if they're not pursuing the truth

01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:05.000
The truth is sacred to absolutely. Absolutely. You want to admit that but it is okay

01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:08.520
So so I was thinking about the scientific endeavor and I

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:13.320
I thought a lot about this when I was reading Jung's work on alchemy because Jung attempted to

01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:17.480
Situate the development of science in this alchemical fantasy and it's very interesting piece of work

01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:25.400
So he believes that there was this immense motivated narrative that provided the historical precondition in the realm of unconscious fantasy

01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:30.680
For the flourishing of science. So it's an amazing argument in any case

01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:36.040
Thinking about that I thought well, there's a set of facts and that's kind of the argument you're making

01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:40.440
There's a set of facts independent of the narrative and that's kind of the scientific viewpoint

01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:43.480
There's a set of facts independent of the narrative and even more importantly

01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:48.120
We should identify the set of facts that's maximally independent of any narrative

01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:54.280
Because why should your facts prevail and we want a universal set of facts and fine

01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:58.040
Look what we've got with that. But then I think wait a second

01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:04.040
When you're practically engaged in the processes of science the sort of things that kuhn tried to lay out

01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:08.360
Is it not the case that you're always engaged within a

01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:11.080
system of practice and perception

01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:15.880
That's defined by at least an implicit if then statement. And so I would say

01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:17.480
if

01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:19.480
This is your aim then

01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:24.040
That's the set of relevant and true facts conditional implications. Well, yeah

01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:29.800
Well, so so if you're a medical researcher, it's like well, here's here is what the cancer cell is doing

01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:33.080
Well, what do you mean doing because it's doing an infinite number of things

01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:37.560
Oh, well if we want to understand the cancer cell so that we can eradicate cancer

01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:42.280
Then this is what the cancer cell is doing now. It's also doing something

01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:46.280
That's independent of that narrative. But the weird thing about that is that

01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:52.120
It's doing such a plethora of things independent of that narrative that you drown in the complexity

01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:55.480
Of course, so so then so then we have a problem here, right?

01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:59.160
Is that you they have the facts of the cancer cell which are multiplicitous

01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:03.400
Then you have the set of relevant facts, which hopefully are still facts

01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:09.160
But those aren't derivable without the narrative that we should save lives that saving lives is good that we can

01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:13.880
Pay careful attention to the horrors of disease and in the attempt to ameliorate suffering

01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:18.840
All of that framework seems to be a precondition for the abstraction of the relevant facts

01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:24.280
I agree with everything you said. Okay, what I disagreed with was the identity statement you slipped in which is the

01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:30.600
The ethic is a narrative. That's exactly what's in dispute here. The dispute isn't that we don't need these normative structures

01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:36.440
I'm not disputing that at all. What I'm what I'm disputing is that they're all reducible to the narrative

01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:39.080
Ethic that there's also a

01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:42.520
Right. Well, that's also why I wanted to get to the last I mean

01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:45.720
I think that I'm coming closer to you than ever because

01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:49.080
In the sense that because I need to work it out

01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:53.080
But because I I see that in like let's say that there is

01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:56.760
Clearly a distinction in the story like in the story

01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:02.680
There is a story and then there's the laws and they're related, but they're different. And so I need to think about how they're

01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:05.560
Why they're right? Well, one of the things well

01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:12.600
There's an interesting weirdness there that's also associated with the scientific enterprise because one of the things you're trying to do

01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:17.960
Imagine if you impose a strict narrative that there's a very limited set of facts that make themselves manifest

01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:20.520
Well, what you want to do scientifically is say well

01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:25.640
Let's abstract out the set of relevant facts in a manner that's relevant to a multitude of

01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:29.480
Redemptive narratives simultaneously. Okay, so let me pick up on that

01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:33.640
So let me try and using what we've just said specify the difference how I would put it

01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:36.600
I think what science does is it picks up on

01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:42.280
Nomological relations which are supposed to be as you say causal invariance for the universe

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:47.560
Right force equals mass times acceleration. We'll forget Einstein right across narratives

01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:52.520
Right, right a narrative is not about causal laws. A narrative is about an

01:45:54.120 --> 01:46:01.000
Irrepeatable causal pathway when I ask why did Napoleon lose at Waterloo? I don't give you a law

01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:05.960
I give you a narrative. I give you a narratives are this event leads to this event

01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:12.520
It's a through line like you said, but it's a through line that explains the specific occurrence of specific events

01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:16.520
It's exactly the opposite of my mind of what science does

01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:23.320
Science is trying to explain the universality that is not captured in the specifics of a specific causal pathway

01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:27.160
That's why I can't see okay, so then okay, so imagine this imagine this

01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:30.120
You have a so there's this notion in the old testament

01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:31.960
There's a sequence of stories

01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:37.320
So it's an aggregation of stories and there's an idea that the meta narrative of christ is implicit in that

01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:43.240
Set of narratives. Yes. And so then I have this idea. Well, and Jung talked about this as well said

01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:48.600
Imagine you take any random sample of narratives comprehensive random sample of narratives

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:53.320
And you attempt to extract out the common story. It's going to be an image of something like christ

01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:56.200
You could even say that that's what christ is in some sense

01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:58.600
so and we can argue about that but

01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:02.520
It's a it's it's like saying that the hero narrative is archetypal

01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:08.520
It's the same idea if you have 25 narratives and you see what makes them interesting adventure stories

01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:09.640
It's the hero archetype

01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:13.640
So the reason why you can recognize it as a through line in the first place is because it has a pattern

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:19.160
But that's my point my point is just like the through line of all the aspects is not an aspect

01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:26.600
The through line of all the stories is not itself a story. Yeah, but see I'm not so sure that's that is definitely what we're arguing about

01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:28.600
And I'm not I'm not saying I know this

01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:30.920
There may be a distinction between

01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:32.680
as story

01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:39.160
And the pattern of all stories and maybe that's something we can think about too because in my work in maps of meaning I called

01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:41.880
Just a narrative a story

01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:45.320
But the the story that unites all narratives is a meta story

01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:48.440
It's and piaget caught on to this too in some sense because

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:54.840
He started to try to find out what kids regarded as true and then by the end of his career

01:47:54.840 --> 01:48:00.200
He said well what we really want to know if we're studying truth isn't the nature of any contingent truths

01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:03.560
So any representations within a system narrative otherwise

01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:09.640
But the process we need to specify the process by which all truths come to be as the ultimate truth

01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:16.520
And then I would say that the meta narrative that constitutes christ from the symbolic perspective is the story of the

01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:18.920
process by which

01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:24.120
What would we say the it's the story it's certainly the story of the process by which narratives transform

01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:27.240
It's not exactly a story because it's a meta story

01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:31.960
It's but it's the problem of it's the problem of this kind of apophatic move

01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:36.680
It's kinematic reality, which is true also of the nomological order as well

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.600
It is the origin of the nomological order. It's not a nomological order

01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:44.200
Exactly in the same way that the origin of a narrative is not a narrative

01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:48.200
It's not a detailed narrative or say the pattern patterns all move into the manner in which they

01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:53.400
Transcend themselves and ultimately give up to this apophatic like this this negative

01:48:53.800 --> 01:49:00.280
Space or negative reality and I think the nomological and the narrative and what this self transcending dimension

01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:02.680
They all converge

01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:06.920
Okay, so imagine imagine that's not to say they're identical

01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:10.360
No, of course they're not because that's why they can write right right right

01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:15.560
And I I think if they were so obviously identical, we wouldn't have a conflict between science and religion

01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:18.520
Which we apparently have so so it's an important distinction

01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:21.960
So imagine you have this set of narratives that are particularized and out of that you

01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:28.280
You extract a general pattern and the pattern is something akin to the process of adaptation itself

01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:33.480
Which is the manifestation of the divine word let's say and its ability to call order out of chaos

01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:36.440
It's got this hierarchy of narratives and there's something at the pinnacle

01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:43.240
And so then imagine that you have a set of corresponding facts and each specific narrative would give you a set of

01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:44.600
proximal facts

01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:49.560
But there's an abstraction from the facts that approximates universal scientific truths

01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:55.080
But I would say that maybe they exist in relationship to the application of that meta narrative

01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:59.080
Because isn't it the case now? I don't know. I can't figure this out

01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:02.520
Isn't it the case that we abstract out commonalities?

01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:05.400
like force equals mass times acceleration

01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:10.200
Because we want to further our adaptation to the world. Yeah as simultaneously

01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:12.920
We're exploring the intrinsic logos of

01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:17.560
Ontology, but we've already agreed to some degree that there's a there's a

01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:25.720
Similitude between that ontology and the epistemology. And so maybe as we abstract out from scientific truths towards the universal we

01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:30.120
Not only must we simultaneously move up the abstraction level

01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:37.720
In a narrative sense. Jung's point would be we better or we'll misuse the normal logical to destroy ourselves

01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:43.240
Wouldn't that also be the case if we abstracted up the narrative without also going up the normal logical?

01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:51.400
Well, he he he believes he believed that the the problem with the first millennia of christianity was that we did exactly that

01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:53.720
Was that we emphasized

01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:56.760
spiritual redemption to such a degree

01:50:57.800 --> 01:50:59.400
try to reduce

01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:03.320
Redemption itself to the spiritual then the world was still crying out because of its

01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:07.480
Ontological suffering. It's like well if we're all redeemed by the sacrifice of christ

01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:10.920
it's like what's with all the poor and diseased people and that that

01:51:11.480 --> 01:51:17.160
Call for the unredeemed material was part of what he saw as the motivational foundation for the

01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:24.280
The the systematic investigation say that led to the development of medicine. Yeah. Yeah, so so there was an insufficiency

01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:27.240
There was an insufficiency

01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:31.320
Maybe it's the insufficiency of getting lost in epistemology if it's just a narrative

01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:34.200
It's just a narrative. Well, it's not it has to refer to the world

01:51:35.320 --> 01:51:37.640
Okay, so well

01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:42.360
That complicates things right because we're part of what we're stuck on here to some degree is

01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:47.640
In that ontological realm that's outside any given narrative. There is also a logos

01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:52.360
And then the question is is that ontological logos the nature of the world itself

01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:56.680
Somehow a narrative and the christian idea to answer that would be

01:51:57.640 --> 01:51:59.880
Well, that I don't know because creation is separate

01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:02.040
creation

01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:08.680
Yeah, speaking on behalf of christian. Yeah, I think christianity makes the claim that the logos is ultimately a person not a narrative

01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:12.440
It's not a story. Yeah. Yeah, that's very important. Right. The logo is not an it's not a story

01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:14.680
Everything culminates into

01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:21.720
Into into the into the person and person literally means originally means hypostasis that which stands under

01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:24.760
Yes. Yes. Well, it has to be a person right right

01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:29.480
Well, that's why I also said though that it's the description of a structure values is a narrative

01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:36.200
So as an embodied ideal christ isn't a story. No, right, but the description of his embodiment

01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:39.960
That's a story and the images are a story and the the reason we want the story

01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:41.880
Is because the story

01:52:41.880 --> 01:52:45.800
Causes us to that to the ethic. That's why we value the stories is right

01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:50.440
I would like to see the world the way you see it because you have a whole set of tools that I don't have

01:52:50.680 --> 01:52:53.400
And so if you can tell me a story and I can enter into your world

01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:58.040
Then that is truly redemptive because the facts now array themselves in a slightly different way

01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:02.600
That might be very valuable to me if I run into one of these objects that you described, you know

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:08.040
I'm running an algorithm and something objects. I don't know what to do. What would you do? Tell me

01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:10.680
What you did in the similar situation

01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:13.400
And so I don't think the story

01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:17.080
The story isn't the yeah god that gets so tricky

01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:23.800
The the the christian emphasis certainly is is that the embodied reality is the fundamental reality

01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:28.280
Yeah, but the story isn't nothing. That's for sure. I'm not saying I know you're not. I know you're not

01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:31.720
I'm saying that at all. I was trying to answer jonathan's question, right?

01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:34.280
And we're running into the difficulty that I see

01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:37.400
Whether or not I'm right or wrong

01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:41.320
There's a difficulty. Oh, definitely that's the difficulty. I'm putting my finger on

01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:45.880
I'm trying to put my finger on in the meeting. Well, it's also the difficulty that I'm trying to address with this set of propositions

01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:50.520
It's definitely a difficulty. Okay, but we got somewhere we got somewhere in that I would say

01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:56.200
I think it was very valuable. Okay, so I'm going to skip to number five here every set of values is hierarchical

01:53:56.440 --> 01:53:58.040
Otherwise, there's no prioritization

01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:02.680
I think we agree on that because we've already agreed that there has to be a prioritization

01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:06.120
And there has to be that implies a hierarchy. So the one thing I wanted to ask there

01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:10.360
Sorry, I seem to be the the diffusivity. No, no, but it is again

01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:14.360
Let's go back to embodied living and then this is actually something you see in narratives

01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:17.800
And I would also say that it's something that some of the parables of jesus

01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:23.880
Point to because parables. I think mcfag is right parables are narratives that destroy themselves as narrative structures

01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:27.560
They're kind of like the way koans destroy themselves as questions

01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:29.240
um

01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:31.240
And so what I want to say is

01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:37.400
Let's say that there is we we seem to have like there's the true the good and the beautiful or we have the narrative the

01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:43.480
Nomological and I'll call it the normative in terms of betterment or something like let's say is it the case?

01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:47.080
The thing is the hierarchy stable

01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:53.160
What I mean by that is you get narratives you get stories get works of art great works of art

01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:58.120
In which it looks like they're picking up on something that is true to our embodied experiences

01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:03.560
Sometimes we sacrifice the true for the good or the good for the beautiful or the beautiful for the true

01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:08.280
Like we seem to be making trade up. We don't seem to have a stable what's on top

01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:13.000
We we shift the prioritizations around. There's a lot of great art at least

01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:15.720
Proposing that so I think it's a reasonable thing

01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:21.560
Right. Well, I think that's partly a consequence of the confusion about what constitutes the unification

01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:24.280
so part of the project I have here is that

01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:29.720
I'm I'm beginning to view all the narratives that are laid out in the biblical corpus as

01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:34.840
They're snapshots of the different idea of what should be at the top. They're like the through line

01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:39.960
Well, they're representations of the through line. We still don't know what the through line is so to speak, right?

01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:44.600
But there's snapshots so I for example in in the opening lines of genesis

01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:49.640
God so we'll say by definition. God is what is at the top. We'll just start with that

01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:54.680
And I'm not going to make an ontological claim about that just an epistemological claim

01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:59.720
God is what's at the top of your value structure. Okay, so what what should that be?

01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:04.040
Well, let's say that's a mystery. Okay, so the bible is an attempt to

01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:10.920
To represent that mystery from a variety of different narrative perspectives and so I'll give you a couple of examples

01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:12.920
So in the earliest

01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:15.960
Chapter the beginning of genesis

01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:23.640
God is the word that derives habitable the habitable order that is good out of chaos and potential

01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:29.160
Okay, so that whatever god is that's part of it. Okay, so that's that's

01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:34.360
And god is a creative force and then then there's the next thing is is

01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:36.200
that

01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:39.880
God is whatever it is that human beings are made in the image of

01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:48.120
That also provides them with a worth that transcends the merely material in some sense because god is outside creation

01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:55.000
And if man is made in the image of god, then there's something about man. That's valuable. That's outside of the mirror

01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:58.600
materiality. Okay, so that's the next proposition and then

01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:05.400
God is rapidly that which forbids and allows so that happens in the garden and then god is

01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:08.760
That spirit that you walk with when you're

01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:11.400
Unselfconscious and not ashamed

01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:18.200
So that's that's the story of adam in the garden and then in noah god is that which

01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:21.880
Calls you to batten down the hatches and prepare

01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:28.520
When if you're wise in your generations you see that chaos is coming and then in the abrahamic story

01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:34.280
God is that which calls you out of the comfort of your family into adventure and so it's like

01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:42.200
Who knows what the union of all those things are right because they're they're quite multiplicitous very but but

01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:46.760
But I think they're very sophisticated and you might say well is that god it's like well

01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:49.400
Do you follow the call of adventure?

01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:53.720
Do you take your own intuition seriously when you think that the flood is coming?

01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:59.080
The answer to that generally is well you either follow that or you're in trouble people

01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:03.960
You sure know that and is god the divine word that generates habitable order

01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:08.920
The habitable order that is good out of chaos. Well, do you believe that truth has that power?

01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:11.560
so I think

01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:18.040
Okay, so these are all ways of pointing to that which might unify the disunity that you see now

01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:22.920
You can't boil it down in some way the same way that you boil down beauty

01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:30.520
You know, it's it's harder to specify and I think what the bible is attempting to do and and I think this is true of religious writings

01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:33.400
of many sorts is to

01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:38.520
What is it it's a characterization of this it's first of all

01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:43.880
It's an insistence that the thing at the top is a spirit, right? It's not an idea. It's not even like beauty

01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:49.000
It's not an abstraction. It's a spirit that can inhabit which is kind of an incarnation idea

01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:53.400
So it's it's a spirit that you can embody or that can season possess you

01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:55.720
So it's really something that's living

01:58:56.360 --> 01:59:01.160
And and so it's not merely an abstract idea and it's not just a normal logical construct

01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:04.600
It's something you enact and it's something in principle

01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:09.560
You might think well if you're and this leads to the next point any hierarchy that is not unified

01:59:10.520 --> 01:59:17.480
Produces confusion anxiety anomy aimlessness and conflict psychological and social. Well, why well?

01:59:17.480 --> 01:59:19.480
It's not unified. You don't know your priorities

01:59:20.040 --> 01:59:23.400
And if it and if it isn't pointing to something valuable

01:59:23.800 --> 01:59:27.160
There's no hope because hope is to be found in

01:59:27.880 --> 01:59:29.880
The movement towards something of value

01:59:30.440 --> 01:59:33.480
So, okay. Well, sorry. That's a lot. No, no, no, but that's helpful

01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:37.720
So let me let me say something and it's not really a pushback

01:59:37.800 --> 01:59:42.920
But it's it's sliding over here and if we can make the connection then maybe we can come to an agreement around it

01:59:43.400 --> 01:59:44.280
so

01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:45.720
right

01:59:45.720 --> 01:59:46.600
Adaptivity

01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:49.480
Adaptivity is a thing and it's really important and it's not an abstraction

01:59:50.040 --> 01:59:50.920
Define it

01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:55.720
Adaptivity is the that you are fitted to your environment in a way that allows you

01:59:56.360 --> 02:00:02.120
To successfully live long enough to reproduce. Yeah, okay. Okay. So that's kind of an interrated game idea too

02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:08.760
You have to live long enough to propagate totally. Yeah, totally. And I'm not here to defend, you know

02:00:09.720 --> 02:00:14.600
A gene version or a group selection. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's not that's not what I want. Yeah, okay. So

02:00:15.320 --> 02:00:18.920
Adaptivity and you want to you want to you know, how does this?

02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:23.560
How does this arise and one of the things you can do is you can say here's all these snapshots of

02:00:23.880 --> 02:00:26.920
Adaptivity and what I can do is I can try and find

02:00:27.560 --> 02:00:31.160
The what what do they all share in common the capacity to elicit or?

02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:38.200
Well, wait a sec. Wait a sec. Wait a sec. So like the problem is right this and this is what you see the

02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:40.840
The naturalists before Darwin doing they're trying to find

02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:46.600
The shared perfection. Yeah, and then Darwin breaks the mold. He says no, no, no, no, you're making the mistake

02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:48.920
There is no

02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:54.600
Right, right. There isn't what there is right is some things are adaptive because they're small

02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:58.600
Some are adaptive because they're large some are fast some are slow some are hard some are soft

02:00:58.680 --> 02:01:00.680
Some are unicellular some are multicellular

02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:06.200
Adaptivity doesn't have but what he finds is but there's a universal process

02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:11.960
That is right that can explain how all of these different snapshots emerge

02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:18.440
But there is there is a perfection and the perfection is being itself. It's the continuation of existence

02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:22.040
Okay, but what you just did you've you've played you're not playing with my analogy

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:27.480
You said I can I can meta that and I'm not denying that you can do that John. Okay. I'm trying to use a meta

02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:35.160
I don't deny that. Okay. I'm not making that claim. I'm just trying to use this as an analogy and I'm trying to say

02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:38.520
Well, it's a powerful objection because certainly the biologists do that

02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:40.760
They say well, there's no teleology in evolution

02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:45.160
And and and I know that you object to that because you say well, there has to be because you can't even

02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:49.800
There's no unity there in any of the organisms and there's certainly no way of perceiving them

02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:55.960
But they also have a point which is there's a nomological unity. Even though there's no narrative. That's how they argue

02:01:56.280 --> 02:02:01.240
There is a universal process that can be understood scientifically that explains

02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:07.240
Adaptivity explain because if you get the theory of evolution, you say right all the organisms should be right

02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:09.560
but then you have the problem that

02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:16.360
Every organism that survives plays out a pattern which is variation on the horizon of potentiality

02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:21.960
And so then you might say well, there is a there is a directionality because if the organism can't

02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:27.000
Very creatively on the horizon of potentiality it can't exist or multiply

02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:30.920
and so then so so there's a teleology that emerges

02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:39.000
Out of the the necessity for survival and reproduction and so and I would say so think about sorry

02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:41.880
I gotta get this out

02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:46.360
I'll say the abstractions you generate in your prefrontal cortex are

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:50.440
avatars of the process of adaptation to the horizon of the future

02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:52.280
and so and so the

02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:58.680
Flowering of the human spirit in its highest sense is an embodiment of the process by which the biologists attribute

02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:04.680
The the adaptivity it's the process that utilize adaptivity. And so maybe those things dovetail

02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:07.240
Well, that's what I'm going to say. So there is a narrative though. No, no

02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:08.760
No, that's what there's what I want to challenge you

02:03:08.760 --> 02:03:13.240
You gave me a model of the logos that I would say is not narrative except for a trivial definition of narrative

02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:15.400
Which is variation and selection

02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:16.920
look

02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:20.600
Instead look let's put it back in the psychological. It's like with humans

02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:22.600
It's the willingness to do that though

02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:25.720
So it's not just the fact that it can can happen and does happen

02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:33.080
And that's partly what brings in the narrative element is you do not have to abide by that like you you that can happen to you

02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:38.360
You can you can have this creative variation and this selection in relationship to

02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:40.920
Adaptivity let's say to keep it biological

02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:43.720
But you can you do not have to do that

02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:47.880
And so I think it's the struggle with that that constitutes the narrative

02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:49.480
I want to push back on you on that

02:03:49.480 --> 02:03:51.800
Okay, I think there's all kinds of stuff

02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:56.600
At the relevance realization doing that variation and selection that you cannot

02:03:57.160 --> 02:04:01.160
Exercise authority over because your authority actually depends on on the right

02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:05.320
So it's different than the level at which you have narrative access to your own being

02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:12.360
And look I think that that's related to Jonathan's objection earlier

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:17.720
That the law is inscribed on the human heart. It's like yes, I agree, but but

02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:20.520
Let me say if I claim that

02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:23.240
human evolution

02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:29.160
builds a material embodiment that strives towards manifestation of the logos and then there's an abstraction

02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:31.720
And and that meets in the middle

02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:37.560
The fact that you can't control all the manifestations of your

02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:45.720
Prioritization structure doesn't mean the logos isn't built into the a priori systems that structure that perception for you

02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:50.520
I'm not denying that what I'm denying is that that logos is ultimately operating as a narrative

02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:55.080
I think the low and look at look at look at even look at even psychologically

02:04:55.480 --> 02:05:00.680
Narrative doesn't emerge until a certain age and it is pre it depends on dia logos

02:05:00.760 --> 02:05:03.720
It depends on dialogue. It depends on joint attention

02:05:04.040 --> 02:05:06.760
It depends on the ability to take turns in conversation

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:11.160
You have to have all this dialogical machinery in place before narrative is possible, right?

02:05:11.240 --> 02:05:14.680
Well the way I would object to that fine. That's a perfectly reasonable objection

02:05:14.680 --> 02:05:17.800
but the problem with that is is that a lot of that scaffolded by

02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:20.840
quasi narrative precursors

02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:26.040
So for example, one of the things you do with a baby before it can engage in in the dialogue is

02:05:26.680 --> 02:05:30.840
verb mediated semantically is you do a dance like play

02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:37.480
And the spirit of the logos is and I would say a narrative spirit is deeply embodied in that because if that isn't taking

02:05:37.960 --> 02:05:40.680
Place within the spirit of love and play and truth

02:05:41.080 --> 02:05:44.840
Then it isn't going to give rise to the capacity later for the dialogos

02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:48.440
So that's kind of the embeddement in some sense of the embeddement

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:50.680
embeddement

02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:56.520
Embedding there's the word of the logos in the material right prior to its manifestation

02:05:56.680 --> 02:06:01.720
And I do think in some sense that's not a story, you know, because if you watch a wolf pack

02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:06.920
What they're doing isn't a story, but if you describe it it becomes a story

02:06:07.240 --> 02:06:10.760
Yes, right. So there is an embodied pattern. That's not a story

02:06:11.400 --> 02:06:13.400
But I think we're agreeing now that

02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:15.720
Okay, okay. Okay. Well, there

02:06:16.600 --> 02:06:21.080
There's a lot of so I guess we go back to where you said the description of a structure of that's right

02:06:21.160 --> 02:06:23.160
I said the description is a story

02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:27.160
Now that doesn't mean that the description doesn't match the underlying behavioral pattern

02:06:27.640 --> 02:06:29.640
You know, I think one of the things I

02:06:30.200 --> 02:06:32.760
sort of thought through and maps of meaning with the moses story is

02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:35.720
Well, why why those laws?

02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:40.680
So you see in the story, it's so bloody cool before moses goes up to the mountain

02:06:41.800 --> 02:06:43.400
He spends

02:06:43.400 --> 02:06:45.400
Decades we don't know forever

02:06:46.280 --> 02:06:48.280
morning tonight

02:06:48.280 --> 02:06:51.240
Judging objections. So the Israelites are out in the desert

02:06:51.320 --> 02:06:56.120
There's no structure and they fight with each other all the time and then they come to moses and say well, we're fighting

02:06:56.200 --> 02:06:57.320
What do we do about it?

02:06:57.320 --> 02:07:03.720
And he like judges them and his father-in-law actually says to him you have to stop doing this because it is absolutely

02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:08.360
Exhausting you and it isn't till after that that so then you think what's he doing?

02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:10.680
We're seeing all these micro narratives, right?

02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:16.120
And then he has to discriminate between them, which means he's turning them into a hierarchy of value because that's what the discrimination is

02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:20.120
This is what's right in this conflict. So conflict

02:07:20.920 --> 02:07:24.920
Hierarchy and then he's doing that just constantly so you can imagine that within him

02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:26.520
this

02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:33.400
Hierarchy of value is starting to be built explicitly then he goes up on the mountain and it's like bang. Oh

02:07:34.520 --> 02:07:35.800
This is

02:07:35.800 --> 02:07:42.200
What all our striving is oriented to and then he comes down the first time it doesn't map as you said the second time it maps

02:07:42.520 --> 02:07:47.480
So the the deliverance of the message from on high has to map on to this and some of this

02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:54.600
Conflict and its agreement would emerge from biological acceptability because the people would say oh

02:07:55.640 --> 02:07:59.720
I feel as though that was just it solves the problem

02:08:00.120 --> 02:08:06.040
And so the the materials in communication then with the abstraction. I think I think we're close to agreement. I guess

02:08:06.920 --> 02:08:08.520
To circle back

02:08:08.520 --> 02:08:14.920
I don't I don't sort of deny that I don't I'm really not denying that narrative is a powerful way for disclosing

02:08:15.480 --> 02:08:16.840
intelligibility

02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:18.200
And the logos

02:08:18.200 --> 02:08:24.360
Right, what I'm saying is is it there's a privileging of it here that I'm okay. So is it okay?

02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:26.360
So is it important? Is it important?

02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:29.480
Is the distinction that I just made between

02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:32.360
an embodied pattern

02:08:32.840 --> 02:08:34.840
and a narrative enough to

02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:40.440
Dispense with your with your objection or is there more to it? Well, let me let me let me see

02:08:41.400 --> 02:08:47.000
Because I think that theories and poems and music things that I'm treating as non narrative

02:08:47.240 --> 02:08:50.920
Can disclose depths of reality that I can't disclose with the story

02:08:51.800 --> 02:08:56.520
Okay, so why is it? Why is it important to you or necessary to make that distinction?

02:08:56.920 --> 02:09:01.560
Do you think? Well, why is out of curiosity? Well, it's important for me is that

02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:04.360
I'm concerned about

02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:06.440
a privileging of narrative

02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:11.560
All used to be an inappropriate privileging of narrative border on idolatry, right?

02:09:12.040 --> 02:09:15.320
In that we are well, that's kind of what the postmodernists do

02:09:15.560 --> 02:09:21.160
So there's definitely a danger there, right? If you overprivilege narrative to the point where the ontology itself disappears

02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:25.160
I think what's the honest thing is that he's afraid that if we embody if we embrace a narrative

02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:28.200
Then the solution to the meaning crisis won't be universal enough

02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:31.960
Is that something that's so that's a practical implication because

02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:34.520
I I would propose to you

02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:35.560
It's a proposal

02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:36.360
Okay

02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:42.920
That whatever is going to resolve the meaning crisis has to reintegrate science and spirituality

02:09:43.080 --> 02:09:49.400
If it does not do that, right? Well, so that's partly also what you're insisting on is that there is this domain of scientific knowledge

02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:57.240
That should be regarded as in some sense independent of narrative and that's I'm still having a very much trouble with that because we still have the problem of

02:09:58.040 --> 02:09:59.640
If then, right? It's like

02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:02.680
But and I don't see how we escape escape from that

02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:07.240
But that's where I push on back on the trivialization if if then constitutes a narrative

02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:09.640
No, no, it doesn't okay if

02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:16.360
Constitutes a narrative if yeah if does because if has to be well if we want to cure disease if we want to

02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:21.400
So Jung believed that the spirit of science grew out of the alchemical fantasy

02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:25.480
And so the alchemical fantasy was we will find in material

02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:28.680
this solution to

02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:30.760
ill health death and

02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:32.200
privation

02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:37.240
Well, yeah ill health death and privation. That's exactly it. And so Jung's point was without that

02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:41.560
Impulse which he regarded as a compensation to the hyper

02:10:42.280 --> 02:10:49.480
Spiritualization that Christianity imposed in the world in the first Christian ion without that fantasy deeply like deeply embodied

02:10:50.200 --> 02:10:53.160
Manifesting itself out of embodied behavior and then out of image

02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:55.400
We wouldn't have been because Jung said well

02:10:55.800 --> 02:10:59.400
How do you get someone to look down a microscope at an amoeba for 10 hours?

02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:03.560
Because like no animal will do that and his notion was well

02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:09.000
We had to be gripped by something of a dream of intense motivational significance

02:11:09.160 --> 02:11:15.240
And it was the dream that redemption could be found in analysis of the transformations of the material world

02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:17.640
right, but like but

02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:21.640
The the the motivating the motivating structure

02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:27.080
Is not the same thing as the reference of of what i'm talking about right right right right

02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:29.480
So i might be narrative to do science

02:11:29.720 --> 02:11:34.120
But we don't want to make the genetic fallacy that that means that everything that science is referring to

02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:39.000
Is a narrative, right? Yeah, right the fact right right that that'd be like

02:11:39.720 --> 02:11:42.600
That's like saying everything i talk about i have to speak in english

02:11:42.600 --> 02:11:47.960
So reality is made of english that does bring us to the postmodern conundrum because they would insist that know all the

02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:53.160
Sets of all the facts that science derives are in some simple sense a narrative right?

02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:56.680
And then that narrative is associated with the drive to power and domination

02:11:56.920 --> 02:12:03.240
And so yeah, we do have to be careful that because we'll fall right into that trap right so that that that's what so if you

02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:06.440
Want to comment no, but i can i say this?

02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:12.280
I I I I do think that a great manner in which modern

02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:14.920
science got developed who does

02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:18.200
Is I think it is narrative that is there is

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:23.720
On the one hand the desire to deliver and but on the other hand the desire to dominate is there right

02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:27.400
We've talked about this before with bacon. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and I don't deny that

02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:27.960
Yeah

02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:34.520
And so there is it there is and so it doesn't take away the but the same motivation can drive people in doing mathematics

02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:37.800
Yeah, right at the same motivation can drive people doing music

02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:44.680
So we don't want to say that's the essence of science or music or mathematics because then we're doing we're removing the important differences

02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:49.480
You're afraid that we're collapsing everything. Yes, but I think yeah, I think that it's mostly about high

02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:51.560
it's about hierarchy in in the sense of

02:12:52.840 --> 02:12:55.640
In the sense that because we are embodied beings that are living

02:12:56.040 --> 02:13:00.680
That are living in the world that are living lives and all that we do all that we care about

02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:03.000
Is part of that reality?

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:06.840
And so even the nomological order, although I think I I agree with you now

02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:12.600
It's definitely not a narrative, but it is embedded. That's why Jordan used it

02:13:13.400 --> 02:13:15.400
The expression embedded in narrative

02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:20.440
Yes, that is that it has to but isn't the reverse the case narrative depends on

02:13:20.760 --> 02:13:23.960
The presupposition that there is an ordered world in which it can take place

02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:28.760
Right, but that the question is then is that logos that constitutes the order so to speak

02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:33.960
If when you represent that do you necessarily represent it as a narrative? And this is a deep question

02:13:34.040 --> 02:13:36.920
I mean, I'm proposing to you that the logos is that which

02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:38.280
Which

02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:44.280
Allows the narrative order and the nomological order to unite to what they're doing. That's what I'm saying, right?

02:13:44.440 --> 02:13:47.800
Okay, but that's fine. I but then I might wonder does it extend

02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:53.160
Does it extend to the narrative order and to the underlying on ontological order as well?

02:13:53.320 --> 02:13:56.440
The logos is both in the story and in the logic

02:13:56.680 --> 02:14:04.520
That's we think about just even follow the history of the word logos and watch how it goes in these two different directions

02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:06.520
With good reason

02:14:06.520 --> 02:14:08.520
Yeah, yeah, well, so okay, so

02:14:08.920 --> 02:14:15.720
Then then the question so you're objecting that the logos isn't a story and and that's so strange and so weird because

02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:20.280
We could say that what the west is kind of split on that because in some sense

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:27.080
If you if you think of the development of the idea of the logos from the greek and enlightenment side the answer would be

02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:30.120
There there's no

02:14:30.120 --> 02:14:34.040
Immediate insistence there that it's a narrative. That's right on the Judeo-christian side

02:14:34.280 --> 02:14:40.200
There's a pronounced insistence that it's a narrative. Yes, and our modern culture is actually a union of those two, right?

02:14:40.280 --> 02:14:44.760
Just described a couple episodes of the awakening for the meaning crisis. That's exactly the argument

02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:46.200
I try to trace out

02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:48.520
And well, and certainly the argument we're having right now because

02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:53.560
Jonathan and I in some sense are making a case where the logo says narrative and embody narrative

02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:59.640
Although you also point to the importance of embodiment. I'm not rejecting. I know. I know. I know while it's very difficult to differentiate

02:14:59.720 --> 02:15:07.320
That's right. Yes, and I do like the idea that there's a hierarchy of narrative with the ideal at the top and then a hierarchy of

02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:13.880
Nomological description and that there's a correspondence between the hierarchies because it does seem to me that

02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:17.400
And I want to puzzle that out one of the things Jung warned about

02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:20.680
he thought there was an ethos in

02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:25.320
The religious story and to some degree in the alchemical story and then when the

02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:29.000
Scientific revolution hit we blew up the normal logical

02:15:29.720 --> 02:15:32.200
Into this massively powerful thing

02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:37.800
But our ethic was left in the same primitive form. So now we're in danger because of that

02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:43.320
I think I think that's exactly right. I think one of one of I talk about this in terms of propositional

02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:49.240
tyranny and algorithmic tyranny right and what we've done is we've reduced

02:15:49.880 --> 02:15:59.080
The logos inappropriately to logic. I strongly resist that move too, right? So you're okay. Okay. Okay. Well, I get I get your caution because I do believe that

02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:05.880
Devolving everything down to the narrative per se does put us in the postmodern trap

02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:08.040
Which is what's all

02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:10.840
In some sense. Well, it's all narrative which is kind of what they claimed

02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:17.080
And that's a problem because then you can dispense with the with the corrective reality. Exactly. Exactly

02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:21.240
So I I I use a stereoscopic metaphor. I think of the logos as

02:16:21.880 --> 02:16:27.080
Like as epitomized in logic as in story and then I try to look through both to a depth

02:16:27.640 --> 02:16:31.000
That's what I try to think of as the logo school. Sorry. Tell me that again

02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:36.840
So, you know how I have the left and right visual field and then I look through them to depth perception. Yeah

02:16:38.040 --> 02:16:39.400
Here's logos as logic

02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:43.320
There's logos as story and I try to look through them to the depth behind

02:16:43.320 --> 02:16:45.960
Yeah, yeah, that's well that seems on the face of it quite fine

02:16:46.040 --> 02:16:48.040
I mean, I'm still in a conundrum because

02:16:49.640 --> 02:16:55.400
We already agreed that the selection of the facts and even the manifestation of the facts as perceptual objects is dependent

02:16:55.400 --> 02:16:57.400
On the imposition of a hierarchy value

02:16:57.400 --> 02:17:01.800
And so that tangles the damn narrative into it again, but so but

02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:07.160
But there's something that's key to the idea of parallel hierarchies that I think is is

02:17:08.040 --> 02:17:12.040
A conceptual way out of this and that's one of the key moves in neoplatonism

02:17:12.440 --> 02:17:15.080
Exactly what you're puzzling over. How do these things?

02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:21.480
What explains their parallel and what explains beyond the parable parallel what I was trying to do with the

02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:25.800
Derascopic what what explains their convergence? Okay, okay, what if

02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:28.680
What if it is something like

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:32.600
Let's say I'm using the word person, but let's use the word consciousness

02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:40.200
Okay, right or so that that that so it's a maximus has this is why I like to maximum so much right because say maximus

02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:46.680
He has he has exactly what you're talking about in terms of this non-melodic order. This is hierarchy of order

02:17:47.640 --> 02:17:53.720
And he has a sense in which the laboratory for that is man, right man with a capital M

02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:58.760
And so doesn't it doesn't it kind of one of the solutions to this?

02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:04.520
When it be the this relevant realization that you're talking about but the relevant realization happens

02:18:05.240 --> 02:18:12.120
Ultimately happens in in consciousness or something like consciousness or I mean, I I think it happens in intelligence

02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:17.400
Because we have a lot of relevance realization going on below consciousness. Okay, and I've talked about this right, okay

02:18:17.400 --> 02:18:23.080
I think consciousness is a kind of intelligence for specific kinds of problems. It'll define normal novel. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:27.080
Yeah, that's the horizon unpredictable horizon of the future, right, right, right, right, so

02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:31.480
But let's say and and I think the issue is yes

02:18:31.800 --> 02:18:34.600
And and what I'm here what I'm sort of proposing is

02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:38.040
intelligibility is something like the way

02:18:38.680 --> 02:18:42.920
Reality is realizing itself and relevance realization is intelligence

02:18:43.240 --> 02:18:48.120
And the good is the fact that we we trust that the

02:18:48.680 --> 02:18:53.080
The intelligence can track the intelligibility and by doing that it puts us in touch with the world

02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:56.120
That's what I was is that a is that a presupposition of faith?

02:18:56.760 --> 02:19:01.960
Is that a presupposition of the faith that was necessary before the manifestation of a real science?

02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:06.040
Yes, the willingness to act on that basis. I think if you do not

02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:11.800
Okay, so I'm not going to I'm not going to deny the importance of the judeo christian story

02:19:12.280 --> 02:19:17.960
Okay, but I would also say that without fedo's argument about the good

02:19:18.440 --> 02:19:23.000
As the ongoing fulfillment of the promise that intelligibility tracks realness

02:19:23.160 --> 02:19:28.120
You can't do science and there's a reason why the scientific revolution is a return to play-doh

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:33.640
Galileo rejects Aristotle and goes to play-doh and says play-doh is right

02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:41.640
Mathematics listen to the words mathematics is the language of reality. There's no math in Aristotelian science for 1200 years

02:19:43.160 --> 02:19:45.000
It turns to play-doh

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:51.000
And that's what brings in the core of why why is that a turn to play-doh particularly? It's because play-doh

02:19:51.560 --> 02:19:55.160
Like really in the republic play-doh makes the argument that

02:19:55.480 --> 02:19:57.800
Mathem you he had it over the academy

02:19:57.800 --> 02:20:02.440
You can't come into the academy unless you can do mathematics because until you do mathematics

02:20:02.760 --> 02:20:09.640
You can't grasp the kind of intelligibility needed to get at the deepest realities of things and science

02:20:09.800 --> 02:20:12.920
So you said the math was the cardinal example of that. Yes

02:20:13.560 --> 02:20:19.080
And all of our science is dependent on math and his his attitude towards myth and narrative is

02:20:19.720 --> 02:20:21.720
Right

02:20:21.720 --> 02:20:29.160
That's how to claim about science. Yeah, is that myths and narratives are right that they are indispensable

02:20:29.800 --> 02:20:33.080
But they do not have the same degree of

02:20:34.440 --> 02:20:39.640
Revelation of the promise of the good okay that math does i'm not saying i'm agreeing with that

02:20:39.800 --> 02:20:41.800
Isn't that why also neoplatonism?

02:20:42.760 --> 02:20:46.440
Could never land right he could never land and become

02:20:47.400 --> 02:20:50.200
A mode of being for a society

02:20:50.600 --> 02:20:53.480
It's it's it that's why we've talked about this before a little bit where

02:20:54.440 --> 02:20:57.320
What christianity does is it provides the body

02:20:58.200 --> 02:21:00.200
for that which was good of

02:21:00.760 --> 02:21:05.880
Of the neoplaton platonic tradition and it provides something more to be to be embodied in a

02:21:06.280 --> 02:21:12.040
In a communion of love and a communion of participation see what what you can't get in neoplatonism

02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:18.280
And and and although i'm not a christian i prefer christian neoplatonism over pagan neoplatonism because

02:21:18.920 --> 02:21:24.520
Plato is striving towards the agape and christianity makes this astonishing the two identity claims

02:21:25.560 --> 02:21:32.600
Both made by john god is the logos and god is agape right and and then that's an identity claim between

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
logos and agape

02:21:35.240 --> 02:21:39.080
Right it's not to say they're the same, but it's also sustained right

02:21:39.800 --> 02:21:43.560
And you're gonna say the trinity and i get that right that's fine and i don't object to that

02:21:43.800 --> 02:21:47.160
But the point i'm making is for me. That's the crucial move

02:21:47.800 --> 02:21:49.800
Here's what i say in response to that

02:21:49.880 --> 02:21:54.280
And this is what i mean when i say about neoplatonism is the interesting that you would use the word crucial

02:21:55.160 --> 02:21:59.000
Yeah, no i think it is i think it is because i go back to my point

02:21:59.080 --> 02:22:03.880
You can't follow the logos unless agape takes you out of egocentrism

02:22:04.360 --> 02:22:11.480
Right right i that's right. Yeah, okay, but also agape can't unfold to you unless there's an order and an intelligibility to it

02:22:11.640 --> 02:22:16.680
It makes no sense to say i love something. Yeah, and there's no intelligibility to it. That doesn't make any sense

02:22:17.080 --> 02:22:19.080
Right. Yeah, okay

02:22:19.320 --> 02:22:25.480
Now but you see the thing is and and this is what i when i'm trying to get at with my idea of the intellectual silk road

02:22:25.800 --> 02:22:31.960
Right that neop, right now our culture the hermetic suspicion were locked into the courtroom of debate

02:22:32.600 --> 02:22:36.280
I propose that we go back and do what we had with the silk road

02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:43.880
Which is the courtyard of discussion neoplatonism has this terrific ability to enter into reciprocal reconstruction

02:22:44.920 --> 02:22:49.320
With christianity clearly it does it with islam, which is what we're doing right now

02:22:49.480 --> 02:22:52.040
Yes, but it does it with islam and that's how you get suphism

02:22:52.440 --> 02:22:55.640
It does it with science you if you take a look

02:22:56.120 --> 02:23:00.680
Read john spencer's book the eternal law you look at what's happening around ironside in that

02:23:00.840 --> 02:23:04.440
They're all invoking neoplatonic or similar ideas to neoplatonism

02:23:04.920 --> 02:23:12.840
Neoplatonism at with galalao it's capable of entering into reciprocal reconstruction with science with islam with christianity

02:23:12.920 --> 02:23:15.480
There seems to be evidence that it can do this with buddhism

02:23:15.880 --> 02:23:19.400
Taoism that's what thomas plant is arguing was happening on the silk road

02:23:19.720 --> 02:23:21.000
so

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:25.720
What you see as a potential defect i see is a benefit which is it doesn't

02:23:26.200 --> 02:23:31.320
It doesn't land because it's designed to land in many different ways and allow people

02:23:31.320 --> 02:23:36.040
Okay, so that's very much related to this idea of apparel a harky if you're abstracting out

02:23:36.680 --> 02:23:41.880
The set of universal facts then those facts are useful in relationship to

02:23:42.360 --> 02:23:44.920
The higher order narratives that unite narratives

02:23:45.320 --> 02:23:49.960
What that's that's exactly. I think that's the claim you just made I I think so let me let me see

02:23:50.360 --> 02:23:55.000
So what i'm saying is that neoplatonism gets us gives us a way to dispose the furniture of thought

02:23:55.320 --> 02:23:59.160
That we can come into deep dialogue and it would allow a sufi

02:23:59.880 --> 02:24:01.400
And it would allow

02:24:01.400 --> 02:24:04.840
You know a christian to have deep discussion. They don't have to agree

02:24:05.240 --> 02:24:09.240
The the silk road wasn't dependent on one person running the silk road

02:24:09.480 --> 02:24:14.680
It was dependent on the fact that all of these civilizations found a way to deeply talk to each other

02:24:14.680 --> 02:24:17.400
Why the silk road metaphor i'm not i'm too historically

02:24:17.560 --> 02:24:23.160
I know what the silk road was but why why use that because the silk road binds the east and the west together

02:24:23.880 --> 02:24:27.880
Right, it's like the golden thread. Yes. It's it's the through line between civilizations

02:24:28.040 --> 02:24:34.360
Literally, but not just the physical road. There is a philosophical silk road and thomas plant by the way

02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:37.240
Who is a christian argues that that was neoplatonism?

02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:42.440
So I think I think in one deep sense

02:24:42.760 --> 02:24:46.040
Well, there's certainly it certainly is the case that to some degree

02:24:46.520 --> 02:24:50.360
If science is a derivation of neoplatonism in the way that you described

02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:52.040
science has also been

02:24:52.040 --> 02:24:56.600
A uniting methodology and system of apprehension because many different cultures

02:24:57.160 --> 02:24:58.280
Are willing

02:24:58.280 --> 02:25:01.240
With different degrees of ability to utilize the scientific method

02:25:01.320 --> 02:25:05.000
I I agree and I would say that's ultimately exactly for the reasons you just gave

02:25:05.560 --> 02:25:08.120
Gave because science has has

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:12.680
Has sort of made implicit within itself many neoplatonic moves

02:25:14.600 --> 02:25:19.880
I mean, I think it's interesting. I would say I mean it doesn't bother me so much in the sense that

02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:23.560
To the extent that that which do play is and present as true

02:25:24.200 --> 02:25:28.200
I don't have that much of a problem when I read saying maximus. I don't even ask myself

02:25:29.080 --> 02:25:32.600
You played play doesn't was this Christianity and I'm not saying you should yeah

02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:36.440
What I'm what I'm saying is and when I read a Sufi, I don't ask myself that question either

02:25:36.520 --> 02:25:41.160
Like if I read ibn Arabi, I would say yeah, he's saying some pretty powerful true things

02:25:41.560 --> 02:25:45.240
You know and I can also recognize the the place to which we disagree

02:25:45.320 --> 02:25:49.720
But he says some definitely powerful things about the nature of reality, which are the

02:25:50.280 --> 02:25:53.480
Think about the imaginal without ibn Arabi. You won't get it

02:25:53.880 --> 02:26:00.200
And and if you want to turn to some very good places to talk about agopic love read sufi read some of the sufi

02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:02.360
you want right like

02:26:02.600 --> 02:26:04.600
I I want to

02:26:04.680 --> 02:26:09.480
So you're you're emphasizing this in large part because or I don't want to put words in your mouth

02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:11.560
But because you also see

02:26:12.360 --> 02:26:19.560
See, I think the belief in the logos is a precondition for dialogue, right? Yes, but you're making a case for

02:26:20.600 --> 02:26:25.640
In some sense, it's not a binary definition of logos. It's one that's informed

02:26:26.760 --> 02:26:30.920
Perhaps properly in equal parts from the tradition of

02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:36.520
Greece and the it's dipolar. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but there's but there's also

02:26:37.640 --> 02:26:40.520
There's no reason to assume that there isn't a deeper unity that

02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:43.880
That both are pointing to

02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:47.720
I mean, we've been acting out that presupposition in some sense in the west since

02:26:48.120 --> 02:26:50.120
Since the time of the Renaissance because that was

02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:52.520
Rome and Greece meeting

02:26:52.520 --> 02:26:54.440
Jerusalem in a real sense

02:26:54.440 --> 02:26:58.920
Rome sorry Roman Athens say meeting Jerusalem in a real sense, but it was true way before that

02:26:58.920 --> 02:27:05.480
I mean that one of the precursors to the Renaissance is the the intellectual reality of Constantinople like new Platonism was just

02:27:06.200 --> 02:27:09.560
Present was present there the whole time. It just was there

02:27:09.960 --> 02:27:14.760
And so we know we don't know much about it because the city was destroyed and everything got scattered

02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:16.200
but the the the

02:27:16.200 --> 02:27:22.920
Let's say the tradition new Platonism the man in which the one of the important matters in which it reached the west was was through these

02:27:23.400 --> 02:27:24.440
these

02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:30.760
Christian scholars that got chased away from the city basically because it was in danger and brought the the text and the tradition to

02:27:30.920 --> 02:27:34.680
And then there's another and then there's the way it comes from the Arab world too

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:39.960
There's sort of multiple time. See what I'm trying to do what I'm proposing is I'm trying to do

02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:45.640
I'm starting to do like a historical thing where I'm trying to look at all of the ways in which it's like the glass

02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:50.280
We can get the multi-espectuality of neoplatonism by seeing all the ways it was able to re

02:27:50.920 --> 02:27:52.920
reciprocally reconstructed itself

02:27:53.960 --> 02:28:00.040
Like reciprocally reconstruct with with christ with Aristotle or with Christianity or with science or with

02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:03.560
So you're taking snapshots of that in some sense in the same way

02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:08.360
I'm trying to do that with the notion of right at the top in the narrative sense using the biblical corpus

02:28:08.520 --> 02:28:10.520
Exactly and I'm trying to find the through line

02:28:10.920 --> 02:28:16.120
The historical through line for neoplatonism because I don't this is maybe where Jonathan and I disagree

02:28:16.440 --> 02:28:18.920
But I think we do it in at least a loving manner

02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:26.920
Well, or don't understand each other fully. It's possible. It's possible. But what I'm what I guess what I wanted to state is

02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:29.880
Your metagame

02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:32.920
Me participating in the dialogue is more important to me than

02:28:33.800 --> 02:28:39.480
Continuing the right relationship is more valuable to me than coming to the right right. Definitely. Okay. Definitely. So I just wanted to state

02:28:39.480 --> 02:28:44.200
Oh, yeah. Well, that's a good place to end. I think I mean we've got a long ways through this

02:28:44.840 --> 02:28:46.040
um

02:28:46.040 --> 02:28:48.040
We'll try to figure out perhaps

02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:53.880
After we think about this for a good while what we might do to continue it because there's a few

02:28:54.600 --> 02:28:59.000
Propositions here that I think are relevant. I just might share them with people that we didn't get to

02:28:59.640 --> 02:29:04.680
Any hierarchy that is unified is made so by the dominion of a superordinate principle

02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:08.920
So something has to bring everything together and has to be at the top to unite

02:29:09.480 --> 02:29:15.480
That principle is most effectively what is common to all that is deemed of comparative relative value within the hierarchy

02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:18.680
So we talked about the commonality between the good the beautiful and the true

02:29:19.320 --> 02:29:21.320
the common principle of value

02:29:22.280 --> 02:29:28.360
Must necessarily be elevated to the highest place in the hierarchy. Well, that's the abstraction of the good

02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:33.240
Maybe it wouldn't matter if it was neoplatonic or the more Christian notion of the logos and then

02:29:33.960 --> 02:29:39.240
This is something that you really influenced me in relationship that bringing to the highest place is

02:29:39.960 --> 02:29:43.320
Personal subordination. So that's above me and I serve it

02:29:43.720 --> 02:29:48.280
Imitation I want to become that faith. I believe that that principle prevails

02:29:49.480 --> 02:29:52.120
Which is it's worthy of what would you say?

02:29:53.560 --> 02:29:58.280
If there's joy in relationship to the recognition of its superordinate place

02:29:59.240 --> 02:30:02.520
Adulation a variant of that in worship, which is sort of maybe

02:30:03.080 --> 02:30:06.760
A worship is what combines all of those and so those are propositions

02:30:06.760 --> 02:30:10.760
Which I would like to impact with you guys and then there's something that's more specifically

02:30:11.080 --> 02:30:15.160
Judeo-Christian after that, which I won't get into now because I think it would be a distraction

02:30:15.880 --> 02:30:16.760
so

02:30:16.760 --> 02:30:18.440
well

02:30:18.440 --> 02:30:24.440
That's a that's great conversation. I'll come to try on any time for this. Yeah, okay. Well, I think we should we should

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
think about

02:30:27.080 --> 02:30:31.880
Doing it again. Well, we'll start halfway through and see if we get to the end. I think that would be very good

02:30:32.120 --> 02:30:35.080
Yeah, well, it's really really see a lot of what we're doing is

02:30:36.200 --> 02:30:40.600
We're differentiating the propositions, right? It's like well, here's here's the proposition

02:30:40.600 --> 02:30:43.720
Here's its complexity and there's some real utility and just

02:30:44.680 --> 02:30:46.680
In just seeing the full complexity

02:30:46.840 --> 02:30:48.840
walking through it

02:30:48.920 --> 02:30:50.920
I mean, this is also

02:30:51.080 --> 02:30:55.160
Right. This is also I think a genuine active fellowship or even friendship because

02:30:55.720 --> 02:31:03.000
Um, do you the more you do that the more responsive you can make your argument to people who want to engage with it? Of course, of course

02:31:03.080 --> 02:31:05.160
that's exactly. Well, I mean, we're trying to get to

02:31:06.120 --> 02:31:13.560
A diverse range of tools that are grounded on something as rock-solid as we can manage. Yeah, so yeah

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:19.560
Thanks for writing us. I don't need to have sightings of suspicion. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. That was that was hey

02:31:19.560 --> 02:31:23.320
My pleasure, man. I'm so glad you guys could come and that we could be together finally

02:31:23.800 --> 02:31:28.920
In person and I think the conversation was a lot more dynamic and deeper than we would have managed

02:31:29.560 --> 02:31:32.600
On zoom total. Yeah, I totally agree with that. Yeah, I totally agree

02:31:33.240 --> 02:31:35.240
All right, great. Thanks, Eric

02:31:35.640 --> 02:31:42.200
Thank you for all all you who are watching and listening and more to follow on many fronts with any luck
