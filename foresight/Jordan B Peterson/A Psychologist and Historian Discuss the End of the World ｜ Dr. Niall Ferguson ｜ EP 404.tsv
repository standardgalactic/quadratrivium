0	4160	The more people refer to the science,
4240	7120	the more you should suspect that they are engaged
7200	10280	in some quasi-religious activity.
10360	14920	This kind of wrong-headedness leads to all kinds of policy errors
15000	19200	because people have focused on the satisfaction of asceticism.
19280	22240	It's very significant that in our lifetimes,
22320	26120	governments have got worse at dealing with disasters, not better.
26200	28520	Despite the accumulation of scientific knowledge,
28640	32960	we seem somehow, collectively, to be worse at scientific thinking.
47560	50080	Hello, everyone, watching and listening.
50160	53280	Today, I'm speaking with historian and author Neil Ferguson.
53360	56760	We haven't spoken before, although I've wanted to for a long time.
56920	61120	We discuss the historical and deeply mythological precedent
61200	63640	of world-ending narratives,
63720	66520	how the Global Doomsday Ethos
66600	71400	abdicates local responsibility while empowering the elite class,
71480	76600	the out-of-control gigantism plaguing our administrative states today,
76680	79240	and how we might strive as individuals
79320	82320	to deal with the genuine tragedy of life,
82400	86040	morally, humbly, and religiously.
86160	90520	So, I was reviewing your book, Doom, this morning,
90600	93440	and I've been wanting to talk to you about it for a long time.
93520	98640	I'm very interested in the apocalyptic vision
98720	106760	and its implications for political organization
106840	109840	and psychological organization as well.
109920	113840	And I thought I'd just start with a couple of comments to get us going.
114840	117720	The apocalypse, in some ways, is always upon us,
117800	120400	and you write about that in your book.
120480	122520	I mean, because people might ask,
122600	129880	well, why has mankind always been consumed at the narrative level
129960	131720	with notions of the end of the world?
131800	134520	And the answer to that is at least in part
134600	140840	because we always inhabit demarcated conceptual worlds
140920	142120	and even embodied worlds,
142120	145000	and all of those worlds do come to an end.
145080	148080	And so, the idea that there's a universal end
148160	150480	is built into the fabric of reality,
150560	153880	and it's something that we have to permanently contend with.
153960	158360	And so, it's there as a lurking existential abyss,
158440	161600	but it's also there as a practical problem that we have to contend with.
161680	166920	And the grand apocalyptic visions, the book of Revelation, for example,
167000	170360	are in part attempts to structure our apprehension
170600	175320	of the, what would you say, the eternal apocalypse
175400	179280	and to also help us determine, practically and politically,
179360	183200	how that might be at least staved off,
183280	187560	although perhaps even managed more comprehensively.
187640	190840	And so, I guess I'm curious,
190920	193280	why did your interest, do you think,
193360	195480	coalesce around the conception of doom?
195560	200320	And it's been a couple of years now since this book was published,
200400	203080	how have your conceptions changed?
203160	210080	And what did you learn as a consequence of investigating this narrative trope so deeply?
210160	215520	There's a great sketch in the Beyond the Fringe album,
215600	220600	which goes right back to Peter Cook and Dudley Moore,
220680	224840	Jonathan Miller and Alan Bennett in the 1960s.
224920	226920	And the sketch is the end of the world,
227160	231800	and it's essentially a sect of millenarians who gather on a hill
231880	235120	to anticipate the end of the world.
235200	239720	They have a long and quite amusing discussion about what it's likely to involve.
239800	243280	Will the veil of the temple be rent asunder?
243360	247960	And the time comes, they count down to the end of the world,
248040	249440	and nothing happens.
249520	251840	And Peter Cook, who's the leader of the sect,
251920	256760	ends the sketch by, well, never mind, lads, same time next week.
256760	259720	And I always thought that was very funny,
259800	264120	because the end of the world has been consistently overpredicted
264200	267880	by human beings for millennia.
267960	270360	We're fascinated by the idea of the end of the world,
270440	272760	and I think it's for a slightly different reason
272840	275680	from the one that you hypothesized.
275760	282480	We have the reality that we as individuals end to contend with.
282600	288720	That's just one of the givens of human life.
288800	291760	Even for billionaires in Silicon Valley,
291840	297880	right now, the end of their individual lives is inevitable.
297960	303400	And that's really the hardest thing to deal with about life, that it ends.
303480	306760	And we also know how it ends, we know what that's like,
306840	311000	because at some time or another in our lives, we encounter death.
311080	314480	The death of a grandparent, a parent, of a friend.
314560	317560	We also see things being destroyed.
317640	321600	We see buildings collapse or bridges.
321680	324920	We see fires consume areas of woodland.
325000	327040	So we know what dissolution looks like,
327120	328640	not just for us as individuals,
328720	334120	but we know what it looks like for expanses of land or edifices.
334200	338360	And I think we therefore infer the consoling thought
338480	344320	that it's all going to go down in flames at some future date.
344400	346520	And the great monotheistic religions
346600	349800	have as one of their centerpieces the end of the world.
349880	353520	It's there in Islam as well as in Christianity.
354600	356000	And I think it's also exciting.
356080	361440	I think we find the end of the world kind of a cinematic prospect,
361520	364000	which is why there are so many movies about it,
364080	366320	as well as works of science fiction.
366360	368440	So we're fascinated by the end of the world
368520	371040	because it's clearly a spectacular prospect,
371120	374160	but it's also consoling to us, we may die as individuals,
374240	376640	but everything's going down at some point.
376720	378400	And the issue is when?
378480	385320	So many Christians at successive periods in the history of Christianity
385400	388960	have anticipated quite an imminent end of the world.
389040	391120	And of course, they're always disappointed,
391200	393240	like Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.
393320	395760	So the consoling issue,
395800	397800	I mean, the easy read on that, I suppose,
397880	401320	is that the end of the world is the precondition
401400	404760	for the establishment of an ever more glorious paradise.
404840	407760	And you can understand a consolation in that.
407840	411320	But you're pointing to a different kind of consolation, I suppose,
411400	414120	which is, it seems to me, correct me if I'm wrong,
414200	418160	that something like Schadenfreude is that the fact that we end
418240	421320	is easier to swallow if we understand it
421400	424360	in relationship to the potential end of everything.
424400	428520	So I don't exactly understand why you highlighted consolation.
428600	432360	I can see it in the heavenly vision, let's say, post-apocalypse,
432440	435360	but yours, you seem to be pointing to something else.
435440	440600	Well, of course, religion offers an afterlife
440680	445960	that will be better and resurrection in the case of
446040	449040	the great monotheistic religions.
449120	453160	But I don't think that's always what's in people's minds
453240	455760	when they contemplate the end of the world.
455840	457720	I was very struck as I was researching the book,
457800	461960	how many times in the midst of a localized disaster,
462040	466000	individuals said it felt like the end of the world.
466080	471680	So when you're in the midst of a massive conflagration,
471760	474760	the biggest wildfire in US history,
474840	479040	or when you're in London during the Blitz,
479120	483040	when you're in the midst of some localized disaster,
483320	485240	it seems somehow consoling to say,
485320	487960	oh, it's clearly the end of the world.
488040	490080	So I don't think it's just that people say,
490160	494360	and therefore I can look forward to being reunited with my ancestors
494440	496200	in some happy afterlife.
496280	498920	I think there's just a sense that if everybody's going down,
499000	501800	that doesn't make it quite so bad as if it's just me.
502680	505720	Well, you know, there might be another element to it as well.
505800	509920	I mean, the Terminator movie series came to mind
509920	513760	when you were walking through your discussion,
513840	516040	I suppose, in reference to the science fiction
516120	517680	representations of the end of the world.
517760	522560	And all of our conceptual schemes,
522640	524760	when they encounter an obstacle,
524840	527160	undergo a collapse into a kind of chaos
527240	528840	and then a potential regeneration.
528920	531600	And that's the same as a stage transition
531680	534080	in Piagetian child development.
534160	536280	And it's the same as the scientific revolution.
536320	540320	And every act of learning is simultaneously
540400	543040	the death of some set of preconceptions.
543120	544960	And there's pain in that,
545040	547680	which is partly why we don't like to have our ideas challenged.
547760	549520	But you know, there's also adventure in it.
549600	553520	And part of the reason that people do go to watch movies
553600	558320	like The Terminator and the plethora of the end of the world
558400	560680	movies that do make themselves manifest
560760	564920	is because I think we can see in the confrontation
564960	568240	with cataclysm an adventure.
568320	569920	I mean, that's what people are doing in a theater
570000	571680	when they're watching the Terminator series.
571760	573440	I mean, it's a dreadful adventure,
573520	574840	but it's a total adventure.
574920	576240	It's completely engrossing.
576320	579560	And it might be that you could imagine,
579640	582280	and I think that this is part of the emphasis
582360	585640	of the Judeo-Christian notion of ultimate sacrifice.
585720	590440	You could imagine welcoming the apocalyptic reality
590520	592920	of the world with open arms,
593040	595160	being willing to undergo that adventure
595240	597280	of continual death and transformation,
597360	599360	and transforming it,
599440	602760	that entire death and rebirth process
602840	607560	into something like the most exciting possible adventure.
607640	610720	I mean, you know, what you do see in the biblical corpus,
610800	613440	there's always a wrestling with the apocalyptic reality
613520	616520	of existence, socially and individually.
616600	621320	And there is the insistence throughout the text
621320	623720	that the appropriate way to deal with that
623800	625720	is not to run from it or deny it,
625800	628360	but to really, to the degree that it's possible,
628440	630080	to welcome it with open arms.
630160	632560	Now, that's a very tricky thing to manage, obviously.
632640	636000	How do you welcome the death of everything with open arms?
636080	637840	But in some ways, it doesn't matter
637920	641000	because it's a reality that people have to face.
641080	643320	I think what's fascinating about the book of Revelation
643400	646760	is that it's so spectacular.
646840	653640	It's an extraordinary visualisation of a cataclysm.
653720	655280	And it's really very elaborate.
655360	658120	It's worth reading and trying to picture it in your mind,
658200	662640	and you realise that you would need the most advanced computer graphics
662720	666080	to realise it on a screen.
666160	670600	I think it's partly that you need a spectacular prelude
670680	673560	for the Kingdom of God to be plausible,
673640	675400	because the terrible truth about the Kingdom of God
675440	677400	is that it does sound quite dull.
678480	684760	I mean, the reality about the saints and angels
684840	689320	and God himself is that they don't really know how to throw a party,
689400	694880	and we need more than that to excite us.
694960	697480	So I think that the apocalypse is attractive
697560	702640	because it's so much more exciting than the ultimate outcome,
702720	704960	the utopian outcome of heaven.
705120	706800	Now, what's interesting about science fiction
706880	709200	is that it really discards utopia.
709280	713120	There's some utopian science fiction about most of its dystopian,
713200	716280	and you gave the example of the Terminator movie series.
716360	720240	That's part of a long tradition of visualising an end of the world
720320	725080	which is dystopian, where an apocalyptic event occurs
725160	729280	and all you're really left with in the case of the Terminator movies
729360	733320	is a pile of rubble in which a few surviving humans
733360	736720	are picked off by killer robots.
737480	739240	The interesting thing to me about science fiction
739320	743160	is that from its birth in the early 19th century as a genre,
743240	746760	it provides the apocalypse without the prospect
746840	750760	of some ultimate reign of God and the saints,
750840	752440	and we find that hugely exciting.
752520	754880	So the paradox at the heart of the book is
754960	757920	that we spend a lot of time thinking about the end of the world.
758000	761080	Of course, environmentalists are the latest heirs
761200	762600	to the millenarian tradition.
762680	764800	They love to say that the world is about to end.
764880	768240	It's in 12 years, it must be now eight years and counting.
768320	772080	That's part of a long tradition where secular movements
772160	775880	embrace often unwittingly religious ideas
775960	779520	about the impending apocalypse.
779600	782640	And that's exciting to people, so they're drawn to it.
782720	787640	Greta Thunberg is just the latest prophet of the millennium.
787680	790600	And I think that's a very important reason
790680	793960	to be sceptical about stories about the end of the world,
794040	796960	because while we spend a lot of time discussing the end of the world
797040	801880	in its latest incarnation, the catastrophic climate scenario,
801960	806400	we kind of miss the much more likely, smaller scale,
806480	810000	medium-sized disasters, and the key point the book makes
810080	812120	is we're getting worse at handling those.
812200	814320	So we spend ages talking about the end of the world,
814400	817400	endless conferences on climate change and the apocalypse,
817480	819600	and we utterly bungle.
819680	823880	Or what was, in fact, not a particularly disastrous pandemic.
823960	828000	And we're going to bungle our way through some geopolitical disasters.
828080	830200	We're doing that right now.
830280	832360	I think that's the critical argument of the book,
832440	834520	and that's why the subtitle of the book is so important,
834600	836760	The Politics of Catastrophe.
836840	840560	The key argument the book makes is that most disasters
840640	844920	shouldn't be thought of as either natural or man-made.
845000	846160	Disasters happen,
846200	850400	and then we, as a species, collectively bungle them or not.
850480	852480	And that's the critical point.
852560	856800	Disasters are, in many ways, politically determined,
856880	858960	even if their origins are natural.
859040	860880	So that's the argument of the book.
862160	865200	As the holiday season unfolds, it's a time of joy,
865280	867040	gratitude, and reflection.
867120	868960	In the midst of all these festivities,
869040	871760	consider taking a moment to reflect on the digital footprint
871840	873720	that accompanies you through the season.
873800	875520	Think about all the information on your phone.
875600	877440	From anything you search, your location,
877520	879520	to the websites you shop at and more,
879600	881840	companies can legally gather this information
881920	884240	and sell your data for profit.
884320	886240	That's why you need to do what I do
886320	889040	and keep your data private with ExpressVPN.
889120	891840	ExpressVPN is an app on your phone and computer
891920	893600	that encrypts all of your online traffic
893680	895840	so whatever you do stays private.
895920	898320	If you think incognito mode will stop people
898400	900000	from tracking your online activity,
900080	902080	think again when you read the fine print
902160	904720	that appears when you start browsing in incognito mode.
904800	906960	It says that your activity might still be visible
907040	908480	to your employer, your school,
908560	910240	or your internet service provider.
910320	912480	Without ExpressVPN, every site you visit
912560	914880	could be logged by the admin of that network.
914960	918240	We love using ExpressVPN because of how easy it is to use.
918320	919680	The app has one button.
919760	922640	Once you turn it on, you're protected from prying eyes.
922720	924880	The Daily Wire has partnered with ExpressVPN
924960	927040	to get you a special holiday offer.

938480	940480	Okay, so there's three themes there
940560	944560	that I'd like to expound upon.
944640	948640	So the first is, you interestingly pointed out
948720	952000	that the dystopia and the apocalypse
952080	955440	is more interesting than the app.
955520	957600	The first one is, you know,
957600	961120	the dystopia and the apocalypse is more interesting
961200	965120	than the subsequent heaven.
965200	970160	And that's the problem with socialist visions of utopia
970240	975120	that people like Dostoevsky laid out in the late 1800s.
975200	976720	In notes from underground,
976800	978800	Dostoevsky famously pointed out
978880	982320	that if we did bring about the socialist utopia,
982400	986000	and he described that as the endless opportunity
986000	988560	of pools of bubbling water,
988640	991200	busy ourselves with the continuation of the species
991280	993200	and eat nothing but cake,
993280	995840	that human beings would break it all
995920	999040	into a chaotic mess at the first opportunity
999120	1001760	just so that something exciting could happen.
1001840	1007920	And so there's the problem with a satiation vision of heaven.
1008000	1009840	So that would be a vision where everyone has
1009920	1011440	everything they need all the time,
1011520	1014880	is that precisely when you do that with an infant
1014880	1018000	or when you enter that state after Thanksgiving dinner,
1018080	1020720	Christmas dinner, all you do is go to sleep.
1020800	1022960	There's no reason to be conscious.
1023040	1026320	Consciousness demands something like an adventure.
1026400	1029920	And the classic vision of heaven does seem lacking
1030000	1032640	in that it isn't obvious what you would do there.
1032720	1035360	So that's something we could delve into.
1035440	1040240	Then you pointed out that one of the additional
1040320	1044160	underground advantages to being an apocalyptic doomsayer
1044240	1045440	is that you can...
1045520	1047200	I'm modifying your argument slightly,
1047280	1050000	but that you can present yourself
1050080	1055920	as the ultimate virtue-seeking redeemer
1056000	1061760	by claiming to be obsessed by nothing but large-scale disaster.
1061840	1064400	You can construe yourself as virtuous
1064480	1066560	because of the depth of your concern,
1066640	1068880	and you can abdicate your responsibility
1068960	1073280	to actually deal with less self-dramatizing problems
1073360	1075360	with the less self-dramatizing problems
1075440	1080000	that actually constitute problems you could solve and address
1080080	1082240	if you put your mind to it in the real world.
1082320	1085760	And there's psychological reasons for assuming...
1085840	1089520	One of the things you see when people's lives go seriously astray
1089600	1091920	is that they don't generally...
1092000	1095040	People generally don't run off a cliff
1095120	1097440	immediately after doing brilliantly.
1097520	1100160	What happens is they make one error,
1100240	1101920	and then they make a more serious error,
1101920	1104160	and then they repeat that 10,000 times,
1104240	1105920	and then they're in hell.
1106000	1113520	And it was their failure to rectify the mini-crisis
1113600	1117520	all along the way that brings upon the apocalypse in their life.
1117600	1120640	And I do see a lot of that political posturing
1120720	1123760	characterizing the modern world,
1123840	1127280	that people act out the role of world-redeeming savior,
1127360	1130480	but they're not actually attending to genuine problems
1130480	1133360	that are right in front of them that they could address
1133440	1136640	if they acted responsibly.
1136720	1138960	And then the final theme you developed, you said...
1139040	1140160	This is very interesting.
1140240	1146160	You said that the notion of natural disaster,
1146240	1149520	in some sense, is ill-conceptualized
1149600	1155200	because there's an ambiguity
1155280	1157360	about whether, when a disaster occurs,
1157440	1160800	it's a consequence of the hand of God,
1160880	1164080	say, in the earthquake or the flood,
1164160	1166800	or the utter failure of the authorities
1166880	1170240	to have prepared properly for a foreseeable disaster.
1170320	1174960	I thought this very clearly when Katrina hit New Orleans
1175040	1179040	because a hue and cry went up about the catastrophe
1179120	1180320	of the natural disaster,
1180400	1183280	but you didn't have to dig very far before you realized
1183360	1186080	that the reason that that hurricane
1186080	1187920	was so devastating in New Orleans
1188000	1191360	was because, well, the dykes hadn't been maintained
1191440	1195120	and they'd only been built to withstand a one-in-one-century flood
1195200	1199040	and that the entire infrastructure of the society was corrupt.
1199120	1202880	And so, you know, in mythological representations,
1202960	1205920	in deep narratives, there is an identity
1206000	1210000	between the evil king and the wicked queen of nature.
1210080	1211680	They're the same thing.
1211760	1213840	And so if the king gets wicked enough,
1213840	1216320	the evil queen of nature arises.
1216400	1219520	And that's a representation of the fact that
1219600	1221840	if your state is corrupt,
1221920	1226240	natural disaster will definitely make itself shown
1226320	1228160	and that you actually can't distinguish.
1228240	1230560	There's no distinction between lack of preparation
1230640	1232880	and a natural disaster in the final analysis.
1232960	1239520	And corruption and blindness facilitate that nexus.
1239600	1241680	So the Egyptians had a story.
1241760	1244320	It's the story upon which their whole culture was funded
1244400	1247520	that the state corrupted, that's Osiris.
1247600	1252160	The state corrupted and became willfully blind as it aged.
1252240	1254800	And then it was overthrown by, that's Osiris,
1254880	1257600	is overthrown by Seth, who's the precursor of Satan,
1257680	1258880	and then he rules.
1258960	1260800	So now the tyrant rules.
1260880	1264080	And then Isis, who's the queen of the underworld,
1264160	1265040	she's nature.
1265120	1269200	She makes herself known again, chaos, right?
1269200	1273840	With enough disintegration at the sociological level,
1273920	1276400	then chaos makes itself manifest again.
1276480	1279040	It's one of the most ancient stories of mankind,
1279120	1281840	playing out that dichotomy between the tyrant
1281920	1285280	and natural disaster that you just described.
1285360	1289840	Let me take those points in order if I can.
1289920	1292480	I think that the most interesting thing to me
1292560	1297600	about fantasies, about the end of the world,
1297680	1301040	about the various millenarian cults through history,
1301120	1305760	is that they are often accompanied by certain forms
1305840	1309920	of behavior that one might characterize as ascetic.
1310000	1312480	So the asceticism is an important part
1312560	1316640	of many religious and secular movements.
1316720	1322240	So the end is approaching, the apocalypse is nearing,
1322320	1326560	and therefore we should fast, or perhaps even flog ourselves,
1326640	1329760	like the flagellant orders at the time of the Black Death.
1329840	1334480	And it seemed to me very interesting how many similar patterns
1334560	1338320	one could see in our time.
1338400	1342240	Whether you are preoccupied with climate change
1342320	1344960	or systemic racism doesn't matter.
1345040	1350320	You should engage in some kind of ascetic atonement
1350400	1353120	in advance of the Great Reckoning.
1353200	1360160	And this, I think, infests a lot of contemporary progressivism.
1360240	1364320	The desire to eat rabbit food,
1364400	1370960	to be constantly trying to eliminate things from one's diets.
1371040	1378000	The desire to engage in abstention from reproduction.
1378080	1382720	We must have children because climate change is so cataclysmic.
1382800	1385120	So you have these sorts of ascetic behaviors
1385200	1388960	which you can find in medieval and ancient religion.
1389040	1391920	So I think that's an important first point.
1392000	1396720	The second point is that mythology of the sort you describe
1396800	1400080	in the case of the ancient Egyptian myths
1400160	1403520	makes a lot of sense if you imagine yourself living
1403600	1407200	in the prehistoric or very ancient world.
1407280	1411440	Life expectancy was very short.
1411440	1414240	Individuals were extraordinarily at risk
1414320	1419600	from a whole variety of premature forms of mortality.
1419680	1422160	And the natural world was deeply mysterious
1422240	1426000	because there was no scientific framework for understanding
1426080	1431200	anything, the fluctuations in the level of the River Nile,
1431280	1437360	the periodic droughts that afflicted early agricultural societies.
1437440	1440880	And so you end up with ways of making sense of
1440880	1445600	an extraordinarily cruel and capricious world.
1445680	1450560	So I think that's an important reason why myths persist.
1450640	1456480	They're deeply rooted in our pre-modern experience.
1456560	1462960	And I think that if one tries to think about our present predicament,
1463040	1469440	it's odd that such things have such enduring power over us
1469520	1472640	because since the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment,
1472720	1476800	we have a much better handle on the challenges
1476880	1482240	that a species like ours faces on a planet like ours.
1482320	1486640	So what's odd is that despite having really quite a good understanding
1486720	1493280	of, say, infectious disease or the ways that hurricanes
1493360	1496240	strike the Eastern seaboard of the United States,
1496240	1501520	we seem to be getting worse at handling pandemics and hurricanes.
1501600	1504560	And that's a really important argument that the book makes.
1504640	1507600	Compared with the generation of the 1950s,
1507680	1510560	the generation of the 2010s and 2020s
1510640	1513280	seemed really quite bad at disaster management
1513360	1516480	in most Western societies, not only the United States.
1516560	1519840	It's explaining that that takes us into new territory
1519920	1523280	because I don't think you can explain the diminishing competence
1523360	1528160	of the modern state without having a theory of its degeneration.
1528240	1532080	And that's something that is a really important part of the book.
1532160	1535760	Okay, so I want to pick up on two of those topics.
1535840	1544080	So the first is you point out that as the apocalyptic vision predominates,
1544160	1546640	there's a turn to asceticism.
1546720	1550000	And then you describe, we could say, veganism and vegetarianism.
1550000	1553520	And the insistence by the environmentalists
1553600	1555440	that we must engage in degrowth
1555520	1557520	and that we must produce our standard of living.
1557600	1564560	And yes, okay, but there's a very interesting psychological rationale
1564640	1572640	for that as well, which is that if the old state of being has become corrupt,
1572720	1573680	so that's the old king.
1573760	1577600	And now we're threatened by its collapse,
1577600	1586240	then the proper thing to do is to engage in repentance and atonement
1586320	1592480	because what you want to do is you want to offer up your stupid preconceptions
1592560	1596240	to be destroyed so that you can rectify the corruption
1596320	1598640	so that you can stave off the disaster.
1598720	1604560	And so now it's interesting because with the millenarian
1604640	1606400	and apocalyptic movements on the left,
1606480	1609040	you have a simultaneous insistence
1609120	1615280	that all sorts of impulsive, pleasure-seeking, licentious behavior
1615360	1619040	should be centered and prioritized and celebrated.
1619120	1621520	But at the same time, you have this insistence
1621600	1625360	that there's a certain kind of asceticism that's also necessary.
1625440	1627680	And I see in that as a psychologist,
1627760	1634080	I see that as a proper mechanism of repair gone astray.
1634400	1641360	Is that, well, you should always be cutting back in this ascetic way
1641440	1647120	on your idiot excesses locally to improve the manner
1647200	1648560	in which you conceptualize the world.
1648640	1651200	That's the continual sacrificial offering
1651280	1654240	of your own insufficiency and your own stupidity.
1654320	1657360	And that does renew the world.
1657440	1660400	And so, but now we've got this dynamic
1660480	1664240	where we globalize the apocalypse.
1664320	1666320	We view the end of the world.
1666400	1670880	We assume that nothing but a kind of universal asceticism
1670960	1672960	and atonement will suffice.
1673040	1675840	That enables us to set local concerns aside,
1675920	1678400	as we already discussed, and to act irresponsibly.
1678480	1683280	And maybe that's part of what's producing this inability
1683280	1688880	to actually respond locally and effectively to genuine problems.
1688960	1690560	You know, in the Old Testament,
1690640	1696160	there's a second commandment is to not use God's name in vain.
1696240	1698640	And what that means, as far as I can tell,
1698720	1702320	is that you shouldn't claim divine motivation
1702400	1705360	for doing things that are actually self-serving.
1705440	1707280	You shouldn't attribute sacred motivations
1707360	1713120	to your own instrumental, impulsive, and self-serving behavior.
1713200	1715280	And then that's echoed in the New Testament
1715360	1718000	with the insistence that you shouldn't pray in public.
1718080	1721840	Now, if you take on the apocalyptic burden and you're virtuous
1721920	1727680	only in consequence of your compassionate concern,
1727760	1731920	it gives you a perfect excuse to dispense with local responsibility.
1732000	1734160	And if you dispense with local responsibility,
1734240	1736880	then you're no longer able to engage
1736960	1739280	in the concrete problem-solving activities
1739360	1740560	of the sort that you described.
1740640	1743920	I mean, what did you conclude when you have a chapter
1744000	1745840	on developing political incompetence
1745920	1750080	and also one on a sort of a belief in scientism?
1750160	1752080	And that seems to me to be part of your attempt
1752160	1755120	to assess the local failure
1755200	1757680	while we're concentrating on the global apocalypse.
1757760	1759280	And so what do you make of that,
1759360	1763360	that concatenation of causal forces?
1763360	1766720	There are two things that are going on, I think.
1766800	1772960	One is that the more people refer to the science,
1773040	1775920	the more you should suspect that they are engaged
1776000	1779680	in some quasi-religious activity.
1779760	1783920	Because the notion of some settled body of knowledge
1784000	1786960	called the science is at odds with the reality
1787040	1790400	of the scientific method, which is a constant struggle
1790480	1793280	to falsify hypotheses through experimentation.
1794880	1798080	During the COVID-19 pandemic, but I think it predates it,
1798160	1800240	it was already going on in debates about climate,
1800320	1803520	there was a lot of spurious invocation of the science.
1804240	1808880	And one might as well have been saying the gods or the deity,
1808960	1813440	because it was, in fact, quite unscientific thinking
1813520	1814160	that was going on.
1814240	1815760	I'll give you an illustration of this.
1816560	1820560	A great delusion is to imagine that we can prevent
1820640	1824320	the rise of average temperatures by large scale
1824400	1825760	asceticism in the West.
1826800	1829760	We must give up internal combustion engines.
1829840	1831920	We should give up eating meat and so on.
1832640	1837840	If we end up buying electric vehicles and solar cells
1837920	1841840	manufactured in China with electricity generated
1841920	1844240	by burning ever larger quantities of coal,
1844800	1849040	the probability of reducing average temperatures is zero.
1850320	1855200	Because that is, in fact, the perfect illustration
1855840	1858720	of wrongheadedness in action.
1859680	1863040	If one accepts the premises of the debates
1863120	1865280	on the causes of rising temperatures,
1865360	1869120	it makes no sense at all for us to behave this way.
1869200	1871520	Our asceticism will make no difference
1872080	1875600	if it manifests itself as increased burning of coal in China.
1875680	1877200	So that's the first thing that's going on.
1877280	1880640	I mean, like, well, or increased burning in coal in Germany,
1880720	1883440	because that's what's happened with the Green Revolution in Germany.
1883520	1884000	Exactly.
1884080	1887840	They shut off the nuclear plants and started up the Lignite plant.
1887920	1893920	So this kind of wrongheadedness leads to all kinds of policy errors
1894000	1898000	because people have focused on the satisfaction of asceticism,
1898000	1902960	the virtue signaling that comes with getting rid of nuclear power stations
1903040	1905040	or internal combustion engines.
1905120	1907440	So there's a kind of generalized failure,
1907520	1911280	which embraces the policy elite to think rationally
1911360	1914080	about the problems that we're trying to address.
1914160	1916640	The second problem, which I think is just as important,
1916720	1918960	is the way the administrative state functions.
1919680	1921840	If you compare central governments today
1921920	1925520	with their counterparts of half a century or 70 years ago,
1925520	1926880	they've become much larger.
1926960	1929920	They're bloated in terms of the numbers of people employed.
1930720	1932800	They intervene in many more ways.
1934880	1939040	There's an enormous corpus of regulation in all western countries.
1940240	1945040	This administrative state, unwieldy regulatory, is very inefficient.
1945120	1948160	It's very bad at achieving its intended goals.
1949120	1951840	That has to do with the way that bureaucracy works
1951920	1956160	and the sclerotic tendencies that the modern state suffers from.
1956240	1961680	So between the science as a quasi-religious way of thinking
1962400	1964000	and the administrative state,
1964080	1966560	we have a very, very dysfunctional approach
1966640	1969200	to nearly all the problems that confront us.
1969280	1971920	And that is really the central argument of doom.
1972000	1974480	It's very significant that in our lifetimes,
1975200	1978880	governments have got worse at dealing with disasters, not better.
1978960	1981280	Despite the accumulation of scientific knowledge,
1981280	1985520	we seem somehow, collectively, to be worse at scientific thinking.
1986960	1988880	The holidays are rapidly approaching,
1988960	1992640	but we can find peace and calm in the craziness of the season with Hallow,
1992720	1995520	the number one Christian prayer app in the world.
1995600	1998320	Immerse yourself in Christmas and Advent prayers,
1998400	2000960	meditations, and peaceful Christmas music.

2048880	2051040	That's Hallow.com slash Jordan.
2054320	2057920	Okay, so imagine this.
2058000	2064800	You magnify the size of the apocalypse, so it becomes a world-ending ragnarok.
2064880	2067440	Then you magnify the size of the bureaucratic state
2067440	2071520	because you have to in order to deal with that apocalypse.
2071600	2076240	Okay, then because the state is so global and large and so central,
2076320	2078640	it loses its connection with the real world.
2078720	2083280	It has no subsidiary organization, and then it flails about pointlessly.
2083360	2087280	Now, I'm going to walk through a couple of narrative representations of that,
2087360	2089760	and it'll tie it back to the imagery of Revelation.
2089840	2091120	You might find this interesting.
2091200	2094720	So you see that dynamic play out in the opening chapters of Genesis,
2094720	2098080	because what you have is the descendants of Cain.
2098160	2102240	So Cain makes improper sacrifices, and he becomes bitter and resentful,
2102320	2103840	and he turns to technology.
2103920	2107600	It's Cain's descendants that turn to technology first.
2107680	2111120	They build the first cities, and then the city becomes corrupt.
2111200	2114640	It becomes corrupt in the direction of the Tower of Babel.
2114720	2117440	Now, the Tower of Babel is a ziggurat.
2117520	2121520	It's a stepped pyramid, and at that time,
2121600	2126160	the potentates of the Middle East were competing to build the largest ziggurats.
2126240	2130640	They were trying to build towers to heaven to glorify themselves,
2130720	2134000	and that's the subtext of the Tower of Babel story.
2134080	2140160	So what happens is that the ultimate Tower of Babel is erected to reach to the sky,
2140240	2144640	and that's a challenge to the supremacy of God.
2144720	2149520	And the consequence of that is that the cosmos,
2149520	2156640	the spirit of the cosmos, the creative producer of the cosmos,
2156720	2161120	makes all those who inhabit the Tower unable to communicate with one another.
2161200	2165520	So they start to lose even the ability to share concepts,
2165600	2167440	and this structure collapses.
2167520	2172000	And it's because that Tower of Babel is too large, it reaches too high,
2172080	2174960	it's too uniform, and it's destined to failure.
2175040	2177840	Because that begs the question, what's the alternative to that?
2177840	2181520	But I would say the entire remaining biblical corpus
2181600	2184560	is actually an attempt to answer that question, but it's very germane.
2184640	2189440	Now, that imagery is picked up again in the Book of Revelation.
2189520	2193680	So one of the central images in the book that I think is very relevant,
2193760	2199680	imagine that the Book of Revelation is trying to conceptualize the apocalypse as such,
2199760	2204800	the manner in which things deteriorate before the ultimate disaster.
2204880	2208880	And so one of the main images is of a seven-headed beast,
2208960	2212400	and on the back of the beast is the horror of Babylon.
2212480	2220160	And it's an image of a centralizing state,
2220240	2223360	a centralizing, a monstrous centralizing state,
2223440	2225520	that's a good way of thinking about it,
2225600	2234720	with multiple heads, with something like disinhibited licentiousness as its partner.
2234880	2236080	That's the image.
2236160	2238720	And so the notion there is that when things deteriorate
2238800	2241120	to the point where apocalypse is likely,
2241200	2246960	you have the construction of monstrous state-like apparatuses
2247040	2253920	aligned with individual fragmentation down to the point of licentious atomization.
2254000	2255920	That's a good way of thinking about it.
2256000	2260320	So you're striving towards, it seems to me in your argument,
2260400	2262560	you're striving towards the hypothesis
2262560	2266640	that there's something like an out-of-control gigantism
2266720	2275040	that's causally related to the inability of these bureaucratic organizations
2275120	2278880	to actually respond to actual occurrences in the world.
2278960	2281040	So two thoughts.
2281120	2282400	There's only one law of history.
2282480	2287280	I'm a historian, and that's the law of unintended consequences.
2287360	2291600	And so what typically happens is that well-intentioned people
2291760	2296400	come to power, identify a problem which they feel they must address,
2296480	2299680	and they undertake measures to address the problem
2299760	2301520	which have unintended consequences.
2301600	2304560	This was true when back in the 1960s and 70s,
2304640	2307840	people persuaded themselves that there was a terrible problem of overpopulation
2307920	2309920	that Malthus was going to be vindicated,
2310000	2313440	and therefore there had to be drastic population control, especially in Asia.
2313520	2317120	And that turned out to have all kinds of unintended consequences.
2317120	2322800	In our time, fears not just of climate change,
2322880	2328480	but of dangerous technological developments have given rise
2328560	2333040	to a view which my friend Nick Bostrom and Oxford exemplifies,
2333120	2336880	that we need to have very, very powerful surveillance powers
2336960	2339920	to prevent bad things from happening,
2340000	2343200	whether it's to prevent CO2 emissions
2343280	2348800	in reaching the levels of the net zero program,
2348880	2351520	or whether it's to stop dangerous research
2351600	2353760	being done with artificial intelligence,
2353840	2358320	we need to empower the state to have even greater powers of surveillance
2358400	2361440	than the mid-20th century totalitarian regimes had.
2361520	2364320	And so one of the key arguments in the book DOOM is that
2364400	2369040	actually totalitarianism is the thing most to be feared.
2369120	2373600	In the 20th century, totalitarian regimes caused way more premature death
2373680	2375120	than anything else.
2375200	2378000	And so the last thing we should want to do in the 21st century
2378080	2380800	is to create new forms of totalitarianism
2380880	2386160	out of the belief that only an all-seeing state can prevent disaster.
2386240	2389520	So this is a really, really important argument that the book makes,
2389600	2392880	and I think it's become even more relevant with the major breakthroughs
2392960	2398720	we've seen in artificial intelligence in the two years since the book was published.
2398720	2404160	The other thing that I would say is we want the universe to be moral.
2404240	2408240	We are very strongly inclined to think when bad things happen to us
2408320	2414000	that they may in fact be retribution for sins that we committed in the past.
2414080	2420720	And even the most rational individual is susceptible to this idea.
2420800	2425520	I know this because my parents did their very best to raise me
2425600	2430960	as a product of the Scottish Enlightenment, an atheist and a devoted believer
2431040	2432320	in the scientific method.
2432400	2435440	But when bad things happen, I have this uneasy sense
2435520	2439840	that I may have brought it upon myself by transgressing in some way,
2439920	2443680	illustrating that you can't really escape the Christian legacy
2443760	2450000	unless you travel a very long, long way away from post-Christian civilizations.
2450080	2452400	Now, it's not, in fact, a moral universe.
2452480	2454480	This is the bad news.
2454560	2455280	It's really not.
2455360	2459040	I mean, a lot of the bad things that happen are random.
2459120	2461440	They're governed by power laws.
2461520	2463600	They're extremely difficult to predict.
2463680	2467200	Wars are, in fact, pretty randomly distributed.
2467280	2470960	There's no cycle of history that tells you when a war is coming.
2471040	2473440	Same applies to financial crises.
2473520	2477200	Wildfires and earthquakes are not normally distributed.
2477280	2480560	They can't really be thought of in probabilistic terms.
2480640	2483440	And so much of the terrible stuff that happens to us
2483520	2488240	has nothing to do with there being a moral universe.
2488320	2492800	A cancer may strike one of us down in a much shorter timeframe
2492880	2496000	than we're both tacitly assuming we have.
2496080	2500960	And if we are diagnosed with a terminal cancer,
2501040	2502640	how will we react to that news?
2502720	2504960	What if I hear this tomorrow?
2505040	2507520	It'll be a tremendous shock to me,
2507520	2512240	mainly because it will render my younger children
2512320	2514720	much more vulnerable in my absence.
2514800	2516640	But will I be able to resist the temptation
2516720	2518080	that I brought it upon myself?
2518160	2520720	It'll be there in the back of my mind
2520800	2526000	because I've just inherited from generations that way of thinking.
2526080	2530400	And it's worth adding one little footnote to this.
2530480	2532320	My friend, the historian Tom Holland,
2532400	2536080	wrote a nice book recently, Dominion, arguing that
2536160	2538320	Christian ways of thinking about the world
2538400	2544400	have outlived Christianity in these secular times that we inhabit.
2544480	2546720	A very good illustration of this point
2546800	2550240	is how much Calvinism is still out there.
2550320	2553520	The belief that you belong to the elect,
2553600	2555440	the people because of predestination
2555520	2559600	who are insured of salvation, is a very powerful one.
2559680	2562960	And it persists long after people have ceased to attend
2563040	2565440	Calvinist church services.
2565520	2568640	I'm always impressed by the presence
2568720	2572640	of the self-appointed elect in academic life.
2572720	2576080	People who have a sense that they are morally superior
2576160	2579600	to those around them, they do belong to an elite.
2579680	2586480	And their behavior should be, as it were, fitting to that preeminence.
2586560	2589280	Now, I am a kind of Calvinist atheist.
2589360	2590720	I come from the west of Scotland
2590800	2593600	where that kind of thinking was very well established.
2593680	2597440	I can see the people who think they belong to the elect
2597520	2601040	all around me in American academic life.
2601120	2603760	And, of course, the critical idea
2603840	2607120	which Robert Louis Stevenson gets at in the Master of Ballon Trey
2607200	2610960	and James Hogg gets in the Confessions of a Justified Sinner
2611040	2613200	is that the elect are the worst people.
2613280	2616560	It's the people who think that they belong to the elite
2616640	2619920	who turn out to be capable of the most diabolical acts.
2620000	2621920	So, you know, if you have that feeling
2622000	2624400	that you might belong to the elect,
2624480	2626560	disabuse yourself of that notion
2626640	2629760	because it often empowers dreadful acts of cruelty.

2690720	2694640	I presume that's why the Gospel in Joinder
2694720	2697200	is that the last will be first, right,
2697280	2698480	and the first will be last.
2698560	2700160	It's pointing to something like that.
2700240	2701920	There's a couple of themes you developed.
2702000	2708320	So you pointed out that it's often the reaction to a crisis
2708320	2709840	that's worse than the crisis,
2709920	2712880	and you pointed to the law of unintended consequences
2712960	2714000	as the cause of that.
2714080	2718560	And I think there's something technically true about that
2718640	2722400	in that there isn't a very large number
2722480	2726080	of possible consequences of any given act.
2726160	2730160	And the probability that you can specify the consequence
2730240	2732640	you want and only that consequence
2732720	2736480	diminishes with the complexity of the action.
2737440	2741200	And you can see even systems as sophisticated
2741280	2744320	as the immune system falling prey
2744400	2747120	to the law of unintended consequences
2747200	2750800	because sometimes people die when they're infected
2750880	2753680	by an organism because the immune system overreacts.
2753760	2757440	And the COVID overreaction was a generalized
2757520	2759920	social immune system overreaction,
2760000	2765680	and it was much worse than the hypothetical crisis itself.
2765920	2769360	But what I wanted to focus on was the reason
2769440	2772080	that that overreach occurs.
2772160	2776800	Now, I've been writing a book about biblical narratives,
2776880	2778160	so they're very much on my mind,
2778240	2779760	and that's partly why I'm bringing them up.
2779840	2783520	But I talked to a good friend of mine and his brother,
2783600	2786560	Jonathan Pascio and Matthew Pascio,
2786640	2791600	about the first apocalyptic cataclysm
2791680	2793760	as it's laid out in the book of Genesis,
2793840	2798000	and that's the Sin of Eve and the Consequent Sin of Adam.
2798080	2801920	Their view is that the Sin of Eve is one of pride,
2802000	2805840	is that she encounters the serpent who turns out to be Satan.
2805920	2810480	So it's the possibility of predation
2810560	2814400	and natural catastrophe allied with the possibility of evil.
2814480	2816720	That's a good way of thinking about it symbolically.
2816800	2820160	And her first presumption
2820160	2825040	is that she can encompass that and hearken to it
2825120	2828480	and listen to its voice and integrate it.
2828560	2830880	And that's what produces the fall.
2830960	2834240	And Adam's Consequent Sin, as he agrees with Eve,
2834320	2837280	and I would say mostly to try to impress her,
2837360	2839760	which speaks very deeply to the motivation of men.
2839840	2843680	And so there's this notion, it's a very, very interesting notion.
2843760	2845280	And I'd like to know what you make of it,
2845280	2850640	is that the fundamental reason that cataclysms occur,
2850720	2855920	and I guess this is an objection to your theory of an amoral world.
2856000	2857920	So we'll see where this goes,
2858000	2860720	is that it's people's overreaching pride
2860800	2863680	that is the eternal precursor to the fall.
2863760	2865440	You know, pride goes before a fall.
2865520	2869360	But it's this notion that we can fight off more than we can chew,
2869440	2874880	that we can encapsulate and control more than we're really competent to.
2874880	2879280	We have an over-expansive vision of our competence.
2879360	2883360	We trumpet that to parade our moral virtue.
2883440	2888640	It motivates us to overextend ourselves in places we shouldn't.
2888720	2894240	And the constant consequence of that is systemic collapse
2894320	2895600	at different scales.
2895680	2898400	And so it begs the question, you know, I've really wondered about this,
2898480	2905440	and you know, if you, I think it's something to meditate on,
2905520	2908640	if you didn't overreach in your life,
2908720	2914960	you know, if you were properly humble in your claims of mastery,
2915040	2918080	if you only dealt with what was local
2918160	2920160	and that was within your bounds of competence,
2920240	2923760	you know, maybe extending yourself a bit to learn,
2923840	2927280	maybe you wouldn't bring on yourself a continual sequence
2927280	2929920	of relatively apocalyptic catastrophes, right?
2930000	2932560	It's like, and you pointed to that at the end
2932640	2934000	of your last sequence of comments.
2934080	2936720	You know, you said, there's a tension there.
2936800	2939440	You said, well, the universe is full of random events
2939520	2941520	and it's not essentially moral.
2941600	2945680	But you also said, but we overreach constantly
2945760	2949360	and that does produce, you know, various forms of cataclysm.
2949440	2953440	So I would say, see, there's a paradox in those two viewpoints
2953440	2955360	because how about this?
2955440	2958720	Is how about our immorality makes us more susceptible
2958800	2962240	to the random fluctuations of the world, right?
2962320	2964960	That joins those two visions together.
2965040	2969920	I think it's rather different from the way you've put it.
2970000	2977120	It's often people with a strong sense of morality who overreach.
2977200	2978800	Humility is important.
2978880	2980720	We need to be humble about our ability
2980800	2982880	to predict the consequences of our actions.
2982960	2987520	It's a nonlinear world, but we are quite linear thinkers
2987600	2990560	and we love to say other things being equal,
2990640	2994400	this act will have the following consequence.
2994480	2999120	But of course, other things are not equal in a complex system.
2999200	3002080	Let me give you an illustration of this point,
3002160	3004720	which is currently in people's minds
3004800	3008960	because of the success of the movie Oppenheimer.
3009040	3012560	Oppie Oppenheimer was a very moral individual,
3012640	3017840	at least he felt himself to be rooted in an ethical education
3017920	3020960	that he'd had at an elite school in New York,
3021040	3030800	drawn out of those ethical premises towards communism in the 1930s.
3030880	3035440	But when given the challenge to build an atomic bomb
3035520	3039120	in order to win World War II,
3039200	3044720	he embraced that challenge and achieved it with astonishing brilliance,
3044800	3049120	brilliance both as a scientist and as it turned out as a leader of scientists.
3049200	3053920	But he quickly began to see, after the bomb had been dropped
3054000	3059120	on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that there were unintended consequences.
3059200	3061680	He was unable to prevent the arms race
3061680	3065360	that soon broke out between the United States and the Soviet Union.
3065440	3070960	He was unable to prevent the invention of the thermonuclear bomb, the super.
3071040	3076640	He lost the arguments about the development of nuclear weapons.
3076720	3078960	And if one looks back at that era,
3079040	3084160	the single most amazing thing to me about that breakthrough
3084240	3088160	is that we have subsequently made so much more use
3088240	3091840	of the destructive potential of nuclear fission
3091920	3094400	than of its productive potential.
3094480	3100000	We've built many, many more nuclear warheads than nuclear reactors.
3100080	3103440	That illustrates, I think, very powerfully the law of unintended consequences.
3103520	3108080	But it began with an individual, Oppenheimer,
3108160	3111280	who was filled with a sense of his own morality
3111360	3114800	and took that sense with him to the grave.
3114880	3117360	Right, okay, but maybe that, okay,
3117440	3119520	but you're pointing to something there
3119600	3121600	that is akin to a point you made earlier,
3121680	3126480	is that you said that he was filled with a sense of his own morality.
3126560	3130880	And I can understand why that might be associated
3130960	3133680	with the totalitarian temptation
3133760	3137120	of religious dogmatism and Calvinism, let's say.
3137200	3140480	But I could say, perhaps I could say in response,
3140560	3142160	he should have been filled instead
3142240	3146160	with a sense of his own potential sinfulness, right?
3146240	3147360	And I would also say that,
3147440	3148880	and you can tell me what you think about this,
3148960	3151600	because these are ideas that I'm just trying to develop,
3151680	3155360	is that you already told me that as far as you're concerned,
3155440	3158800	it's the very people who regard themselves as the elect and the saved
3158880	3162640	and the already moral who are most likely to overreach
3162720	3164480	and who present the biggest danger.
3164560	3167040	You followed that up with a description of Oppenheimer, right?
3167120	3170560	This incredible Luciferian intellect,
3170560	3174000	and that's the proper symbolic representation
3174080	3177760	who engaged in this world-destroying scheme
3177840	3179920	and then was potentially world-destroying scheme
3180000	3181840	and was unable to control it.
3181920	3185840	But you characterized him as convinced of his own moral virtue.
3185920	3188080	So I would say, okay, well, if that's the problem,
3188160	3191840	maybe he should have been convinced of the opposite of that,
3191920	3195680	which would be his intrinsic insufficiency and sinfulness.
3195760	3199360	Now, there is a continual injunction throughout the biblical corpus
3199440	3200800	to do precisely that.
3200880	3202880	And the reason I'm bringing that up, too,
3202960	3206800	is because something else that you said begs a question, you know?
3206880	3211600	If the law of unintended consequence rules,
3211680	3217200	then under what conditions is action, any action, not overreach, right?
3217280	3220240	Because you could say, this is combinatorial explosion,
3220320	3226080	you can't predict the consequence of any action, and yet you have to act.
3226160	3228640	And so then the question emerges,
3228640	3230800	well, since you have to act,
3230880	3235440	but there's the danger of exponentially cascading unintended consequences,
3235520	3238080	in what spirit should you act?
3238160	3241040	And you've already pointed out, well, it shouldn't be in the spirit
3241120	3247600	of smug, self-satisfied, Calvinistic, dogmatic certainty in your moral right.
3247680	3248800	Well, then what should it be?
3248880	3251360	Well, hopefully it should be the opposite of that.
3251440	3254400	You know, and that is a kind of radical humility, right?
3254480	3257200	It's an openness to the possibility of error.
3257200	3260000	I mean, I don't know exactly how those things should be calibrated,
3260080	3262720	but because we do have to act,
3262800	3265120	and it does seem to me that there is a domain of action.
3265200	3270560	Like, what do you think it was that Oppenheimer did wrong, fundamentally?
3270640	3274080	I mean, I characterize his intellect as Luciferian, right?
3274160	3280880	He's reaching for a power that, in principle,
3280960	3283440	I don't know if it should have been forever off limits.
3283520	3285520	I have no idea how to adjudicate that.
3285520	3290640	But you have a sense that Oppenheimer himself recognized that he had,
3290720	3294400	it wasn't that he had too much faith in the comprehensiveness of his intellect,
3294480	3297120	that he was too tempted by the power that was offered to him
3297200	3301280	as a consequence of being developer of this immense weapon.
3301360	3303440	Where do you think he went wrong?
3303520	3306720	That's key to the question of where science itself goes wrong.
3306800	3309360	I should be, I haven't watched the movie,
3309440	3312000	but I read the book American Prometheus.
3312080	3314800	I prefer books to movies.
3314960	3319280	And the book makes it clear that what Oppenheimer got wrong
3319360	3322800	was to flirt with communism.
3322880	3328320	And that was wrong because it was the moment when he set aside
3328400	3333840	his scientific judgment and drank at least some of the snake oil
3333920	3338320	that the Soviet regime was successfully exporting in the 1930s.
3338400	3341920	This was a terrible mistake that ultimately undermined his credibility
3342000	3348480	and limited his power to steer the course of the nuclear race.
3348560	3352400	What he got right was to develop a bomb that could end World War II
3352480	3355600	without the need for a large-scale conventional forces invasion of Japan
3355680	3361520	which would have cost untold numbers of American soldiers' lives.
3361600	3364000	And I think it's very important to emphasize
3364080	3367280	that if Oppenheimer had said to himself,
3367360	3375040	I must be humble and resist the temptation to win this race.
3375120	3378640	And of course, a number of physicists did take that view
3378720	3381040	and refused to participate in the Manhattan Project.
3381120	3382880	It might have been disastrous.
3382960	3388320	I constantly try to remind people in the work I've done on the Second World War
3388400	3392640	that the Axis powers, the Totalitarian powers, nearly won that war.
3392720	3396320	And it took tremendous creativity by a whole range of scientists,
3396320	3400320	not only Oppenheimer, but think of touring those cryptographers
3400400	3405600	who did such a crucial job of making sure that the Allied powers cracked
3405680	3407360	or the Axis powers codes.
3407440	3412560	It took a huge effort to win that war.
3412640	3419840	The critical thing, I think, comes from another secular Jewish intellect,
3419920	3424480	Henry Kissinger, whose biography I've spent a large part of my career writing.
3424720	3430000	In the 1950s and 60s, Kissinger, before he entered the realm of power,
3430080	3433280	came up with the idea of the problem of conjecture.
3433360	3435440	It's an extremely important idea
3435520	3437840	that should be communicated to any decision maker,
3437920	3440640	whether they're in the private sector or the public sector.
3440720	3443920	And the problem of conjecture says that at any given moment
3444000	3449200	when one must take a decision, there is a kind of asymmetry.
3449280	3453760	And the asymmetry arises from the fact that if you act,
3453840	3461680	let's say if you had acted in 1938 to prevent Hitler's takeover of Czechoslovakia,
3461760	3463280	there would have been a cost.
3463360	3465920	The war would have begun earlier.
3466000	3470880	And even if you had successfully prevented a much larger war,
3470960	3473120	the World War that broke out in 1939,
3473200	3475760	you would have got no real gratitude for that.
3475840	3479520	You get no payoffs for the averted catastrophe.
3479600	3482080	Your preemptive action has a cost,
3482160	3484640	and that you're held responsible for.
3484720	3487200	The tempting thing, particularly in a democratic system,
3487280	3491520	is to do nothing, hope for the best, because that has a low cost.
3491600	3496000	And if disaster nevertheless happens, if you're unlucky,
3496080	3497360	then you say to yourself,
3497440	3500960	well, anybody in my position would have made the same error.
3501040	3503600	So the cost of preemption is high,
3503680	3506400	and you have to take a decision conjecturally.
3506480	3510160	Because you can't know that in acting in 1938,
3510240	3513040	you avert a much larger and more dangerous war.
3513120	3514640	You cannot have that certainty,
3514720	3516640	and there are no data that will tell you.
3516720	3519280	So I think decision-making under uncertainty
3519360	3523520	is the hardest thing of all, but it has to be done.
3523600	3526720	And I think what I've learned from Kissinger is that
3526800	3531760	you will be held responsible and judged very harshly
3531840	3534240	for those actions you take.
3534320	3536800	Even if they avert disaster, you won't get thanked.
3536880	3540160	Nobody ever will thank Henry Kissinger for avoiding World War III.
3542240	3545280	Nobody will, I think, ever thank any statesman
3545360	3547040	for avoiding calamity.
3547120	3550240	They will only blame them for the actions that they took.
3550320	3552640	And here's the final point that Kissinger makes.
3552720	3556720	Most choices in the realm of power are between evils.
3556800	3558880	You just have to decide which is the greater
3558960	3560320	and which is the lesser.
3560400	3563120	There are very frequently no good options.
3563200	3565680	I think that's very clear today in the Middle East
3565760	3570880	since we're talking at a time of fresh disaster in that region.
3570960	3574720	There are no good choices facing the Israeli government
3574800	3577120	or even the government of the United States.
3577200	3579520	But there's no option to do nothing.
3579600	3580960	I think that must be clear.
3581840	3583840	Let me take apart what you just said.
3583920	3591920	And so the first thing you brought up is that Oppenheimer flirted with,
3592720	3595680	let's call it, radical left utopianism.
3596400	3600880	Now, that's very interesting because I would say that's true
3600960	3604480	of intellectuals across the West and has been since the...
3605360	3606800	What? I don't know.
3606880	3610720	The last 100 years, and it's certainly something
3610800	3614720	that characterizes the academia at the moment.
3614800	3617520	I mean, Larry Summers came out two days ago,
3617600	3621360	the former president of Harvard, savaging Harvard
3621360	3625520	as a consequence of its descent into this radical leftist,
3625600	3627120	statist utopian vision.
3627200	3634240	So there's something key to the presumption of the intellect
3634320	3637600	and belief in a state-imposed utopia.
3637680	3638960	So that's one thing.
3639040	3642880	Then you said sequence of things that were very, very complicated.
3643440	3649680	The first was, well, inaction also produces a combinatorial explosion.
3649680	3652240	So we're stuck with the necessity of action.
3652320	3653440	So that's a big problem.
3653520	3656560	That brings up the issue again, is then under what conditions
3656640	3657840	is action appropriate?
3658640	3666000	Then you said you're also not rewarded for preventative action
3666080	3669360	because in part because nobody can tell what you prevented
3669440	3670640	if it doesn't happen, right?
3670720	3673600	And so there's no public virtue in that.
3673680	3677680	And that entices the leaders of modern states
3677680	3681680	to forestall action because they'll be blamed for action
3681760	3685120	and then maybe to react precipitously once it's too late.
3685680	3689200	So then again, we're back to the central question here,
3689280	3696880	at least in part, which is how do you organize your attention
3696960	3702560	and sequence your action so that overreach is least likely?
3702640	3705440	Now, you discussed Kissinger in that regard
3705520	3709520	and said that he was constantly choosing between evils
3709600	3712400	and regarded that as a necessity of statescraft.
3713840	3715280	You have to conduct yourself.
3716880	3720240	We talked earlier about this idea that there's a tremendous
3720880	3726320	moral hazard in praying in public and signaling virtue to yourself
3726400	3729840	and demanding recognition for your positive actions.
3729840	3736480	And you said that prevention doesn't produce public claim.
3737840	3740000	That what that has to mean, at least in part,
3740080	3742320	is that you have to be oriented to act properly
3742400	3747520	despite its reputational advantage or cost, right?
3747600	3750880	See, that's exactly it, is that something other than reputation
3750960	3752560	has to motivate your action.
3752640	3756800	And then the question is, what should motivate your action
3756800	3760800	if it's not status, power, and reputation, right?
3760880	3762560	That's exactly right. That's where that should...
3762640	3767040	Inoch Powell said all political careers end in failure.
3768160	3773520	I think that any leader should reconcile himself or herself
3774080	3778400	to ultimate failure because doing the right thing,
3778480	3782000	averting disaster, will not get you rewarded.
3782960	3784720	And I think this is just to...
3784720	3787280	So then why bother? Why bother doing the right thing?
3787360	3789840	And how do you even determine what the right thing is
3789920	3793200	if it's not associated with public acclaim?
3793280	3794400	What would right be?
3794480	3798480	Because it must have ultimately been right for Churchill
3798560	3802720	to speak out against appeasement, as he did throughout the 1930s,
3802800	3806960	to take the helm in 1940 when all his predictions had been fulfilled
3807040	3810240	and Britain had been brought to the brink of catastrophe,
3810320	3814240	to lead Britain to an ultimate victory in 1945,
3814240	3817680	and then suffer a massive electoral defeat.
3817760	3819360	This is a noble story.
3820000	3824320	And I think that's what any leader should aspire to,
3824400	3827040	to be right on the basis of historical judgment,
3827120	3832080	to accept that there will not necessarily be triumphal processions,
3832160	3835440	that there may, in fact, be ignominy at the end of the road,
3835520	3838800	but to have done the right thing, to save your nation
3838880	3841680	and get no thanks for it, that seems to be the most
3841760	3843920	that any leader can aspire to.
3844000	3845200	Okay, okay, okay.
3845280	3847840	Well, I've got two comments about that,
3847920	3851040	and then we'll wrap this part of the interview out.
3851120	3853200	I understand that you have a hard out.
3854080	3858080	You described Churchill's actions in terms of ultimate right,
3858160	3861840	and so you made reference to a concept of ultimate right.
3861920	3865040	And then you turned to a particular concept of ultimate right,
3865120	3870640	which was a form of extreme self-sacrifice with no public acclaim.
3870720	3873040	I gotta say, those are strange things for someone
3873120	3876800	who also said during the same discussion,
3877600	3879840	who proclaimed a kind of central atheism,
3879920	3882960	because I can't help seeing echoes in that of,
3883600	3885600	while the Christian passion, for example,
3885680	3890240	is that you're called upon to do right at your own expense,
3890320	3892320	even your own ultimate expense,
3892400	3895520	with no hope of public acclaim,
3895600	3900080	and you do that in the service of something that's ultimately right.
3900800	3906000	And so, well, that's a parallel that occurred to me
3906080	3907040	when you made the argument.
3907120	3908240	That's a perfectly shrewd observation.
3908320	3910080	I'm a lapsed atheist, Jordan.
3910160	3911600	I go to church every Sunday,
3912640	3915680	precisely because having been brought up an atheist,
3915760	3918320	I came to realize in my career as an historian,
3918400	3922000	not only that atheism is a disastrous basis for a society,
3922080	3923920	atheist societies have probably committed
3924000	3926560	more violations of human rights than there are any others,
3927360	3929680	but also because I don't think it can be a basis
3930400	3934080	for individual ethical decision-making.
3935200	3936640	Church was a Christian,
3936720	3938880	and I think has to be understood as such.
3938960	3942080	So I am a lapsed atheist and proud of it.
3943840	3944640	Ah, okay.
3944720	3947200	Well, you know, it turns out I wanted to talk to you
3947280	3949680	for the additional half an hour that I usually use,
3949760	3952160	but that's actually just a perfectly fine place
3952240	3954240	to bring this part of the conversation to an end.
3954800	3957840	I would be more than happy to talk to you again
3958400	3959520	in some greater detail.
3959520	3962240	There's obviously many other things that we could explore.
3962320	3963840	For everyone watching and listening,
3963920	3967120	most of you know that I'm going to continue
3967200	3971120	to talk to Dr. Ferguson on the Daily Wire.
3971200	3973360	I want to understand more deeply
3973440	3976720	where his interests in such topics
3976800	3978960	arose during the course of his life.
3979040	3981280	I usually use an autobiographical approach
3982080	3983120	in that half an hour.
3983200	3985440	So if those of you who are watching and listening
3985520	3987200	would like to join us on the Daily Wire side,
3987280	3988320	that would be great.
3988320	3990240	Otherwise, Neil, thank you very much
3990320	3992000	for a very stimulating conversation.
3992080	3995200	Thank you to everyone who's paid attention
3995280	3998800	and devoted some time to walking through this podcast with us.
3999360	4000240	Thanks, Jordan.
