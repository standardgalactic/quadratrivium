1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,260
Hi all, it is of course completely presumptuous of me to dare to write and broadcast a video

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:13,760
entitled Message to the Christian Churches, but I'm going to do it anyway because I have

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,960
something to say and because that something needs to be said.

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,320
I've been speaking to and watching and listening to audiences all over the Western world for

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:33,720
the past four years, in person and in virtual form, and have learned a few things in consequence.

6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:39,960
It all started in some sense with the lectures I did on Genesis in 2017.

7
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,880
My family and I took a risk and rented out a theatre in Toronto on the off chance that

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,560
there might be an audience for what might be described as a psychological approach to

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:58,160
our ancient stories and, lo and behold, and Miracle of Miracles, there was.

10
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:06,200
I completed 15 or so lectures walking through the first Biblical book, sold out the theatre,

11
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:15,440
and attracted, surprisingly, millions of viewers, Christians, Jews, Muslims, and atheists,

12
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:21,200
and most of the people who attended lives, and the majority of those who watched online

13
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,260
were young men.

14
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:30,660
That is not a phenomenon that can be easily accounted for, but let me try.

15
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:37,640
Now in the West, because of the weight of historical guilt that is upon us, a variant of the sense

16
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:44,720
of original sin in a very real sense, and because of a very real attempt by those possessed

17
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:51,200
by what might be described as unhelpful ideas to weaponize that guilt, our young people

18
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,260
face a demoralization that is perhaps unparalleled.

19
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:03,180
This is particularly true of young men, although anything that devastates young men will eventually

20
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,080
do the same to young women.

21
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:13,100
And that, in this era of anti-natalism and equally reprehensible nihilism, is precisely

22
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,980
the point.

23
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:21,140
When they are children, boys are hectic for their toy preferences, which often include

24
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,420
toy weapons such as guns, and they're more boisterous playing style, as boys require

25
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:32,700
active rough-and-tumble play, even more than girls, for whom it is also a necessity.

26
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:39,020
When in grade school, boys are admonished, shamed, and controlled in a very similar manner

27
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:44,420
By those who think that play is unnecessary, particularly if it's competitive, and who

28
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:53,900
value a docile, harmless obedience above all, shades of Dolores Umbridge, following all

29
00:02:53,900 --> 00:03:01,500
that, because that's not enough, even when pursued assiduously for total demoralization,

30
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,580
is the inculcation of an extremely damaging ideology, which essentially consists of three

31
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,180
accusations.

32
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:16,900
Number one, human culture, particularly in the West, is best construed as an oppressive

33
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:24,900
patriarchy, motivated by the desire, willingness, and ability to use power, defined as the compulsion

34
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:31,180
of others against their will, to attain what our purely selfish and self-serving ends.

35
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,300
This is true at every level of analysis.

36
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:41,060
Marriage is akin to slavery, friendship to exploitation, political disagreement to war,

37
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,780
and business arrangements to deception and theft.

38
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,180
And this is true not only of the current social arrangements that characterize our culture,

39
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:58,460
particularly in the West, but also the fundamental reality of history itself.

40
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:06,340
Number two, human activity, particularly that undertaken in the West, is fundamentally

41
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,580
a planet-disspoiling enterprise.

42
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:14,900
The human race is a threat to the ecological utopia that existed before us, and that could

43
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,660
hypothetically exist in our absence.

44
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:24,380
We might well be construed even as a cancer that threatens the very viability of the complex

45
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:31,100
systems that make up the ecosystem of the Earth that shelters and supports us.

46
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:37,220
We are facing a Malthusian catastrophe of overpopulation and biosphere degradation.

47
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:43,380
And we have to place extreme limits on our wants, even our needs, so that survival itself,

48
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:49,500
even in a much reduced form, can be guaranteed.

49
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:56,060
Number three, the prime contributor both to the tyranny that makes up the oppressive patriarchy

50
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:02,420
and structures all of our social interactions, past and present, and the unforgivable dispoiling

51
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:08,460
of our beloved Mother Earth is damnable male ambition, competitive and dominating,

52
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:14,540
power-mad, selfish, exploitative, raping and pillaging.

53
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,060
You might think that I'm overstating the case.

54
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,380
Think again, sunshine.

55
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:26,900
We in the West are facing an all-out assault at the deepest levels on what that old Joker

56
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:34,800
Jacques Derrida deemed the foul, logo-centric conceptual structure of civilization itself.

57
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,780
To take that apart, that's a society centered on the encouraging, adventurous, masculine

58
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:49,020
spirit and that privileges that hated word of all things, the divine logos.

59
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:55,540
And what should we worship and celebrate properly other than that, deconstructionists, the words

60
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,460
of that mass murderer Karl Marx?

61
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,020
And it is precisely those young men who are deeply conscientious, capable of guilt and

62
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:10,300
regret, who have come to believe in pain that every deep impulse that moves them out into

63
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:16,540
the world for the adventure of their life, even that impulse drawing them to women, is

64
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:23,100
nothing but the manifestation of a spirit that is essentially satanic in nature.

65
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:30,980
This is not only wrong, theologically, morally, psychologically, practically and scientifically.

66
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,180
It is literally anti-true.

67
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:39,900
It's not a mere misstatement about the nature of reality, a minor conceptual error, but

68
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:46,060
something that literally could not be farther from the truth, and something that distant

69
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:52,860
from the truth comes from a place that cannot be distinguished from hell.

70
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,340
The Christian Church is there to remind people, young men included, and perhaps even first

71
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:05,260
and foremost, that they have a woman to find, a garden to walk in, a family to nurture,

72
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:12,060
an ark to build, a land to conquer, a ladder to heaven to build, and the utter terrible

73
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:23,260
catastrophe of life to face stalwartly in truth devoted to love and without fear.

74
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,180
Invite the young men back.

75
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:33,980
Say literally to those young men, you are welcome here if no one else wants what you

76
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,900
have to offer.

77
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,180
We do.

78
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,460
We want to call you to the highest purpose of your life.

79
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:46,420
We want your time and energy and effort and your will and your goodwill.

80
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:53,980
We want to work with you to make things better, to produce life more abundant for you and

81
00:07:53,980 --> 00:08:00,340
for your wife and children and for your community and your country and the world.

82
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,100
And we have our problems.

83
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:08,740
In the Christian Church, we are more abundant, sometimes far too often corrupt, and sometimes

84
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,900
deeply so.

85
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:16,260
We are outdated, as are all institutions with their roots in the dead, but still often wise

86
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,820
past.

87
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,740
So join us.

88
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:29,420
We'll help fix you up, and you can help fix us up, and together we'll aim up.

89
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,420
But here is a message to those young men skeptical about such things.

90
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,780
What else do you have?

91
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,420
You can abandon the churches in your cynicism and disbelief.

92
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:45,300
You can say to yourself, narcissistically and solipsistically, the church does not express

93
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,500
what I believe properly.

94
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,180
Who cares what you believe?

95
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,700
Why is this about you?

96
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,420
Do you even want it to be about you?

97
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,100
What if it was about others?

98
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:05,400
What if it was about your duty to the past and to the broader community that surrounds

99
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,980
you in the present?

100
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,860
What if it was incumbent upon you and vital to your health and willingness even to live

101
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:19,860
to rescue your dead father from the belly of the beast, where he has always resided,

102
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,220
and to restore him to life?

103
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:32,340
Once again to the churches, Protestant, you're the worst at the moment, Catholic, Orthodox.

104
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:40,220
Invite young men, put up a billboard, say, young men are welcome here.

105
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,980
Print some flyers and put them in a box by the billboard.

106
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,820
Signal the existence of those flyers with an arrow, with the words, more information

107
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,940
about attending here.

108
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,820
Tell those who have never been in a church exactly what to do, how to dress, when to

109
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:04,940
show up, who to contact, and most importantly, what they can do.

110
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:09,620
Ask more, not less of those you are inviting.

111
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,580
Ask more of them than anyone ever has.

112
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:21,580
Remind them who they are in the deepest sense and help them become that.

113
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,740
For churches, for God's sake, quit fighting for social justice.

114
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,620
Quit saving the bloody planet.

115
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,980
Attend to some souls.

116
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,340
That's what you're supposed to do.

117
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,100
That's your holy duty.

118
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,340
Do it now, before it's too late.

119
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,020
The hour is nigh.
