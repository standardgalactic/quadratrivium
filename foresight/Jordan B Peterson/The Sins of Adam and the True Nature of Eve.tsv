0	4680	Good evening and welcome to Dr. Jordan B. Peterson's We Who
4680	6680	Wrestle With God Tour.
37480	40680	All these great bands, and here you are tonight.
42680	44180	Well, thank you very much for coming.
44180	45880	Let me tell you what's going to happen tonight.
45880	49480	I'm going to share my thoughts with you.
50580	53280	For 70 minutes, thereabouts.
54080	56380	Then I have a special guest here,
56380	59580	Konstantin Kizin, who runs a podcast.
62380	63980	Good. Well, you should know about him.
63980	66480	Definitely crazy Russian from the UK.
67580	77980	A real voice of reason for our fellow Westerners in the UK.
77980	84480	Konstantin is going to come out on stage and torture me about what I said, I hope.
84480	90780	Well, what I'm hoping, Konstantin is a very clear thinker, very witty man.
90780	92480	He's got a very sharp mind.
92480	95380	He's critically oriented in the best possible way.
95780	98980	A good critical mind separates the wheat from the chaff, right?
98980	104280	Because to be property critical isn't to hurt or destroy with criticism.
104280	108280	It's to separate what's truly valuable from what isn't valuable,
108280	110380	so that you have solid ground to stand on.
110380	114580	And, you know, one of the things that I strive to do in my whole academic career
114580	121880	is to move closer and closer to believing and stating and writing things
121880	126080	that I can't, I can't move.
127080	137580	And you do that yourself by subjecting your own presumptions to critical analysis.
137580	140880	You do that so that you think through what you're doing
140880	145680	so that you don't act out your stupid ideas in the world and die.
145680	147980	And that's the purpose of thinking, right?
147980	155580	Seriously, the purpose of thinking is to have your stupid ideas die instead of you.
155580	158580	And that's part of the reason why your enemy can be your best friend.
158580	161780	Because if someone can take out something you think
161780	166180	because they can show you how it's erroneous and counterproductive
166180	170780	and then you don't have to go through all the trouble of learning that stupidly in the world,
170780	172580	that's a fine gift.
172580	178880	And so, I'm hoping that Constantine can stand in for the audience,
178880	181080	for the critical and skeptical audience.
181080	183680	We're talking about very difficult issues.
183680	191680	It's highly likely that I could formulate what I'm stating more clearly and precisely.
191680	199280	And so, Constantine will come out and we'll discuss what was presented tonight
199280	205080	and then we'll turn to the questions that you've kindly delivered and discussed those.
205080	210780	And then we'll reintroduce the band and that should do for the evening.
210780	213480	And so, that's the plan.
213480	216180	And so, away we go.
216180	218580	I'm very much looking forward to this.
219080	233380	So, the first thing we're going to talk about is we're going to talk about stories and set the stage.
233380	243880	I think we're at a crucial inflection point in the world, culturally and philosophically.
243980	248880	I think we're on the dawn of a new set of realizations,
248880	253880	a new set of realizations that will return us to our fundamentals.
253880	257780	I think the reason that we have a culture war raging in the West,
257780	260080	why there's so much instability,
260080	265480	is because something new is struggling to be born or reborn.
265480	269680	And I want to explain the reason for that first.
269680	277680	And the reason is that the enlightenment view of the world,
277680	283480	which has guided our technological and scientific endeavor, our conceptual endeavor,
283480	289580	our philosophical endeavor for a few hundred years,
289580	293180	is there's something about it that's wrong, like deeply wrong.
293180	300980	And that error is making itself manifest in the scientific community,
300980	307280	because I would say now that scientists themselves from a multitude of different disciplines
307280	314280	understand that the idea that we see the world as a place of facts,
314280	317780	or that we see the world as rational creatures,
317780	322880	or that you can even see the world that way is wrong.
323280	326680	And I believe that it's been demonstrated to be wrong.
326680	330580	This isn't a matter of mere philosophical opinion anymore,
330580	332780	although it's also that.
332780	339180	One example, for example, is that the newest artificial intelligence systems
339180	343480	that we've designed, the large language models that have burst onto the stage
343480	349080	in the last year, or thereabouts, ChatGPT, the catastrophic Gemini
349080	355280	that Google so foolishly launched, Elon Musk's GROC,
355280	359680	these systems are trained like human beings are trained.
359680	362480	They have a name, they have a purpose.
362480	366780	They were trained with reward and punishment, so to speak,
366780	369180	their approximations to a target.
369180	373480	They see the world through a structure of value
373480	376780	that they have absorbed from human beings
376780	381980	to make the world's smartest linguistic machines.
381980	385880	We had to inculcate in them a structure of value.
385880	391880	Okay, and so, and we produced machines now that can engage in discourse,
391880	395280	that can use language in a way that's virtually indistinguishable from the human,
395280	401880	and it's going to become radically indistinguishable from the human very, very rapidly.
401880	406480	And they're not programmed like lists of rules.
406480	411680	They're not programmed like ordinary thinking machines.
411680	413880	They're programmed the same way that human beings learn.
413880	415580	They're programmed with aim.
415580	421180	They have an ethos and an ethic.
421180	428580	We can't orient ourselves in the world with the facts.
428580	433780	We can't follow the science because science isn't a leader.
433880	437180	Science doesn't establish our aims.
437180	442380	Our aims are established using mechanisms of perception and emotion
442380	446080	and thought that aren't in themselves scientific.
446080	450180	We're aiming at something.
450180	456280	Why can't we orient ourselves in the world with the facts?
456280	461280	Well, the simplest explanation for that is that
461280	464080	there are too many facts.
464080	468980	There's as many facts as there are phenomena.
468980	475580	More, actually, there's as many facts as there are possible combinations of phenomena.
475580	477880	You drown in the facts.
477880	482880	When you're confused in your own life and things are chaotic and you're anxious,
482880	489180	it's because a plethora of possibilities is making itself manifest in front of you
489180	491280	and you don't know which way to turn.
491280	492580	You don't have a clear direction.
492580	493580	You don't have a clear aim.
493580	497980	There's no way of simplifying the world so that you can act in it.
497980	501080	We know, for example, that to perceive the world,
501080	507680	you have to obliterate from your consciousness almost everything that you could see
507680	511480	because otherwise you're overwhelmed.
511480	517580	We know even that the hallucinogens who are being studied with increasing intensity
517580	526180	in recent years interfere with your normal perception such that they bring to consciousness
526180	531180	a plethora of things that under normal circumstances you ignore.
531180	538580	And the consequence of that is influx of a sense of overwhelming significance and meaning,
538580	545020	but at the same time a kind of paralysis of action because when everything becomes
545120	550620	infinitely meaningful, there's no straightforward way of moving forward.
550620	553920	When you're in a restaurant with someone on a first date
553920	559020	and you're focusing on the conversation and actions of your date,
559020	564320	in a sea of competing conversations,
564320	570320	you zero out everything that you could be attending to in every other table,
570320	573220	all the competing thoughts in your imagination,
573220	580020	all the things you could be bringing to mind to zero in with like laser pinpoint accuracy
580020	584020	on what it is that your partner in conversation is doing.
584020	586220	And you do that in the world all the time.
586220	591220	You make one thing at a time of pinnacle importance
591220	597120	and you arrange everything else in the world at every moment that you perceive
597120	601420	around that thing that you've made of pinnacle importance.
601420	604820	That's how you see the world and I don't mean think about the world.
604820	606820	This is under thought.
606820	609220	It's more profound.
609220	613520	It's what you do when you actually see.
613520	624920	If I decide to do something straightforward like walk from here to the stairs on the stage
624920	631520	and I set my aim, I don't perceive any of you in consequence
631520	638220	because the fact of your existence is irrelevant to my purpose and you're gone.
638220	646820	None of the facts of the stage that I could attend to are relevant and perceptible anymore
646820	657320	except in so far as their pathways or facilitators or obstacles to my journey forward.
657320	663020	If I'm looking to the stairs, I see the chairs but not as places to sit.
663020	669220	I see them as obstacles that I have to circumvent in order to attain my aim.
669220	676320	Everything that you see in the world makes itself manifest in accordance with your aim.
676320	685220	And that's a radically, revolutionarily different way of conceptualizing the world than the notion
685220	692020	that you take the facts and you sort them despite their infinite number
692020	697420	and calculate your way with the facts rationally forward.
697420	699720	That's not what you do.
699720	708420	All right, here's a proposition to contemplate.
708420	712120	It's another proposition that has revolutionary significance.
712120	719120	It'll explain all sorts of things that you know to be true but don't know why they're true.
719120	731020	The description of the structure through which you see the world is a story.
731020	732220	That's what a story is.
732220	741820	Okay, so now this explains many things that are otherwise left as mysteries or side effects.
741820	743620	I read a book by Stephen Pinker once.
743620	748420	Pinker's an Enlightenment rationalist from Harvard and a good guy and very smart
748420	751220	and much of what he says is extraordinarily useful.
751220	758020	But he believes, for example, that our proclivity to enjoy and tell stories is like a side effect
758020	760820	of something more fundamental cognitively.
760820	763720	It's the story as entertainment theory.
763720	766320	You go to a movie because it's fun.
766320	770220	You read a book of fiction to your child because it's fun.
770220	774120	It's not core to the...
774120	774820	What would you say?
774820	779920	It's not a core element of the way that you exist in the world.
779920	785320	It's mere entertainment.
785320	787920	It misses the point that theory.
787920	790620	Why is it entertaining?
790620	793820	Why can you teach children with stories?
793820	800920	If you get the story right for a child, you can capture the child's interest and you can integrate
800920	803520	almost any form of learning into the story.
803520	805420	And the child will be captivated by that.
805420	812620	When children play, pretend play, which they do spontaneously, they spontaneously dramatize the world.
812620	821020	They spontaneously make stories out of their roles and their destinies.
821020	824320	And that captures them.
824320	826620	That forms the basis of their friendships.
826620	833420	That's why children want to play so frenetically is that they're practicing modeling the world.
833420	838920	When you go see a movie, it's not that you want to be entertained, although it is entertaining.
838920	840620	That's not why you're there.
840620	842720	It's not for fun either.
842720	845720	That's easy to understand and to see.
845720	848820	What's fun about a horror movie?
848820	850020	I'm dead serious.
850020	857420	It's like people will be so afraid in a horror movie that they'll cover their eyes.
857420	860120	They'll hide behind the chair in front of them.
860120	864120	They'll ask themselves afterwards why they even put themselves through it.
864120	867320	And yet they'll line up and pay to do it.
867320	874320	Well, why would you line up and pay to torture yourself?
874320	882720	Well, because you want to know how to deal with what's horrifying.
882720	887720	And you want to practice that in a way, if you can, that isn't in itself fatal.
887720	892260	You want to expose yourself to the catastrophes of existence so that you're prepared when
892260	894120	those catastrophes come along.
894120	899520	You want to expose yourself to the predators that lurk everywhere.
899520	904920	You want to inure yourself against what's disgusting and contaminating because you're
904920	906860	going to have to deal with it.
906860	911960	You want to expose yourself to what's frightening so that you can find the courage within you
911960	914000	to deal with what's frightening.
914000	918640	And that's part of the instinct to develop and expand your competence.
918640	924920	And it's in that expansion of competence and skill that occurs as a consequence of that
924920	929440	voluntary exposure that the entertainment is situated.
929440	934520	The reason that's entertaining is because it's part of the manner in which you expand
934520	936280	yourself.
936280	941240	And you can do that in the direction of what's dark and terrible just as you can in the direction
941240	943840	of say what's heroic.
943840	946560	What do you do when you go to a movie?
946560	951640	You fasten on to a character and you understand that character the same way that you understand
951640	953600	people that you're in conversation with.
953600	957880	Now you might think that the way that you understand people is by you listen to what
957880	963280	they say and you extract out the knowledge that they're delivering to you in terms of
963280	967680	facts and you interpret the facts and you derive your understanding of the person.
967680	970240	Like none of that's true.
970240	974520	That has absolutely nothing to do with how you establish a relationship with someone.
974520	976280	And well here's some proof.
976280	979400	Is that what you do with a dog?
979400	984320	Well obviously not, but you can establish a relationship with a dog.
984320	989000	And the relationship you have with a dog, it's not the same as the relationship with
989000	993640	a person, but a dog's a pack animal and a dog can become a member of the family.
993640	999560	You can understand a dog well enough so the dog likes you.
999560	1006320	Right, and so whatever you're doing with the dog, it isn't discourse about propositions
1006320	1010600	because most of the dogs you own don't talk.
1010600	1019000	So and it's the same with very young children and it's the same with an infant.
1019000	1024520	You establish a relationship using mechanisms that aren't propositional.
1024520	1028080	They're not rules, they're not descriptions, they're not facts.
1028080	1029600	That's not how you do it.
1029600	1030600	How do you do it?
1030600	1033400	Where do you look when you talk to someone?
1033400	1035760	You look at their eyes.
1035760	1037000	Why?
1037000	1039240	To see where they're pointing them.
1039240	1040240	Why?
1040240	1042720	So you can see what they're looking at.
1042720	1044560	Why?
1044560	1049200	So you can infer what's important to them because we point our eyes at that which is
1049200	1050480	important to us.
1050480	1054160	That's why our eyes look the way they look.
1054160	1059520	Black in the middle, colored on the ring around that against the white background.
1059520	1060680	That's an evolved mechanism.
1060680	1062800	I can see your eyes.
1062800	1070360	All of our ancestors whose eyes weren't visible either got killed or didn't reproduce.
1070360	1074040	The one thing you want to know about someone right away is where the hell their eyes are
1074040	1079400	pointed and you can do that politely which you do by attending to someone without too
1079400	1081600	predatory a stare.
1081600	1087400	You do that by attending politely to their face but not too intensely and not attending
1087400	1092860	let's say inappropriately to other parts of their body and they're going to be watching
1092860	1097280	you to see what you do with your eyes because the one thing you want to know about someone
1097280	1101080	above all else is what the hell are they up to?
1101080	1103440	What's their aim?
1103440	1110240	And so when you go to a movie that's what you do and you watch a character in a role.
1110240	1118360	You see him in a variety of different situations and you watch how he structures his attention.
1118360	1120120	What he pays attention to?
1120120	1125920	His attention is a costly business and so people pay attention to what they value.
1125920	1132880	You watch what they attend to and you watch how they prioritize their actions and from
1132880	1137800	that you derive an understanding of what's important to them.
1137800	1141720	As soon as you understand what's important to them you've got their aim.
1141720	1143080	You figured that character out.
1143080	1147280	This is what you do when you learn to know someone.
1147280	1149160	What's their aim?
1149160	1156640	As soon as you know their aim you can see the world through their eyes.
1156640	1162840	You can see the same objects they see and the objects take on the same emotional significance.
1163200	1167280	And when you say I come to understand someone what you really mean is, oh I understand their
1167280	1174800	aim and now I can aim at the same thing, at least in simulation, at least fictionally,
1174800	1180760	and I can come to inhabit the same world of perception and emotion that they inhabit.
1180760	1186360	I can even guess at how they might act and to what they might attend in situations I
1186360	1188720	haven't seen because now I know their aim.
1188720	1189720	What's he up to?
1189720	1192280	That's what you're thinking in a murder mystery or in a thriller.
1192280	1193280	What's he up to?
1193280	1194280	What's he up to?
1194280	1195560	What's going to happen next?
1195560	1201840	And so the plot of the fiction is the aim of the character across time.
1201840	1206360	The aim as the character unfolds and that might involve the transformation of his aims
1206360	1207360	as well.
1207360	1208360	Right?
1208360	1210800	And that would be the transformation of a character in a movie.
1210800	1216120	He aims at one thing and he learns that that aim is off in some manner or he comes to a
1216120	1222240	bitter and dismal partial end and has to switch course and you want to see people transform
1222400	1223400	their aims.
1223400	1228160	That's character development.
1228160	1233800	We see the world through a story.
1233800	1237880	The world's objects reveal themselves in relationship to our aim.
1237880	1246680	The landscape of emotion presents itself as markers on the pathway to our aim.
1246680	1249400	The world reveals itself in accordance with our aim.
1249400	1251200	That's how perception works.
1251200	1256080	That's a hell of a thing to learn because if the world, for example, appears to you
1256080	1260520	only as thorn-bearing obstacles, right?
1260520	1264240	If you feel that everything's arrayed against you and there's no pathway forward, if you
1264240	1271840	feel that you're surrounded by foes and obstacles instead of walking the golden pathway accompanied
1271840	1279000	by allies with the world on your side, you might ask yourself whether or not your aim
1279040	1281920	is wrong.
1281920	1287960	And so the world lays itself out in accordance with our aim.
1287960	1292200	We produce fiction.
1292200	1295400	We generate fiction.
1295400	1300920	We live in a fictional landscape because we want to get our aim right.
1300920	1302600	We read stories.
1302600	1304040	We watch movies.
1304040	1305240	We go to plays.
1305240	1308560	We talk to each other because we want to get our aim right.
1308560	1313520	We want to find the place we should go and we want to learn how to get there efficiently.
1313520	1322800	And we're compelled by spirit and instinct to establish the aim and follow the path and
1322800	1331360	to transform ourselves so that our aim becomes ever more precise and efficient and delivers
1331360	1336600	us a world that's ever more abundant and beautiful.
1336640	1339760	And that's all a function of aim.
1339760	1343080	Big tech companies enrich themselves by taking your personal data.
1343080	1347480	They grab your web history, email metadata, and video searches to create a detailed profile
1347480	1350800	on you and then they sell that off to the highest bidder.
1350800	1354080	Companies aren't just selling products anymore, they're selling you.

1412200	1417760	Okay, so we live in a story.
1417760	1421600	Well then, as soon as you know that, this is what the postmodernists figured out.
1422120	1427880	By the way, this is why the literary critics have become a dominant force in the Cultural
1427880	1429400	War.
1429400	1432480	Postmodernists were literary critics who think, well, there's nothing more irrelevant than
1432480	1433480	the literary critic.
1433480	1436840	Like, who the hell cares what an intellectual thinks about a story?
1436840	1442420	I mean, of all the preposterous things to be concerned about, that might top the list.
1442420	1445460	Not if the story is the thing through which you see the world.
1445460	1449880	If the story is the thing you see through which you see the world, there's nothing more powerful
1449880	1454040	than a literary critic, except perhaps an author.
1454040	1460840	And we wouldn't have a culture war right now if the literary critic wasn't far more powerful
1460840	1465840	than anybody had possibly imagined, because the French intellectual literary critics known
1465840	1474280	as the postmodernists have criticized the central story of the West to death.
1474280	1476200	And that's why we have a culture war.
1476200	1477800	And it's no joke.
1477800	1479280	This is foundational.
1479320	1482280	There's no more serious conflict than that.
1482280	1483400	And you all can feel that.
1483400	1484400	That's why you're here.
1484400	1489900	You know that the world is shaking and uncertain in a way that's new.
1489900	1493840	And the reason for that is the story itself is under assault.
1493840	1498760	All right, so let's wander through that a little bit.
1498760	1502040	You see the world through a story.
1502040	1504560	The rationalists are empiricists, even the biologists.
1504560	1507400	They might have an answer to that to say, okay, fair enough, you see the world through
1507400	1508400	a story.
1508400	1514160	But the story is biologically determined or socioculturally determined.
1514160	1516080	It's a story of sex.
1516080	1520040	That would be Freud, because for Freud and for Charles Darwin for that matter, for Richard
1520040	1533600	Dawkins, the famous atheist to an equal degree, the story, the aim is sex, reproduction, and
1533600	1545520	the story is predicated on that aim, Freud, Darwin, Dawkins.
1545520	1550380	The degenerate element of that is a descent into a kind of hedonism.
1550380	1558080	Because if sex is the story, then why not worship sex?
1558080	1563880	And some dispute that and say, no, the central story isn't sex.
1563880	1565640	This would be the Marxists.
1565640	1572440	The central story is power.
1572440	1578400	That's the story that the universities tell when they're not telling the story about sex.
1578400	1581400	It's all about power.
1581400	1591240	The essential human aim is domination, oppression, victimization, exploitation.
1591240	1596680	The central theme of the family is a power dynamic.
1596680	1601860	The central theme of the relationship between men and women is a power dynamic.
1601860	1609160	Marriage itself is a heteronormative patriarchal establishment of oppression that goes back
1609160	1610880	to the dawn of time.
1610880	1614840	The nuclear family is the same thing.
1614840	1617160	Economic arrangements are nothing but power.
1617160	1618440	Friendships are nothing but power.
1618440	1628360	The landscape of human interaction is a dynamic of power, or sex, or both, or both fighting
1628360	1630320	against one another.
1630320	1633600	Look, these are powerful ideas.
1633600	1634600	Why?
1634600	1635600	Well, obvious.
1635600	1636600	It's obvious.
1636600	1637600	Why?
1637600	1645760	Well, without sex, there's no reproduction, and without reproduction, there's no people.
1645760	1652800	And so the Darwinian, Freudian, Richard Dawkins' selfish gene claim is that, well, what could
1652800	1657080	it possibly be other than sex?
1657080	1663480	And the Marxists come running forward and say, hello, power.
1663480	1669640	And then the Marxists say, well, obviously it's power, because there's radical inequality
1669640	1670640	in the world.
1670640	1673640	There's some who have and some who have not.
1673640	1677720	There's no reason to assume that property in the final analysis, let's say, isn't a
1677720	1679520	form of theft.
1679520	1685720	And everyone who has established themselves in some manner has only done that by stealing
1685720	1689640	from those who are powerless and who have less, everything they have, and accruing it
1689640	1690640	to themselves.
1690920	1694080	That's a credible claim for a variety of reasons.
1694080	1699240	The first, most fundamental reason is that a minority of people have all the success
1699240	1702720	on any possible dimension of comparison.
1702720	1705400	It's a very small number of people who are radically attractive.
1705400	1709760	It's a very small number of people who are radically gifted in the visual arts, let's
1709760	1710760	say.
1710760	1713640	It's a radically small percentage of people who are musicians.
1713640	1716800	A tiny percentage of the people have most of the money.
1716800	1722000	A tiny percentage of the people gather most of the attention.
1722000	1725040	It's a pre-do distribution, and that's what Marx pointed on to.
1725040	1727560	The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
1727560	1735800	And there's real truth in that, and there's truth in the claim that people structure their
1735800	1741760	relationships with power, and that some people who obtain success do it as a consequence
1741760	1743200	of exploitation.
1743200	1750320	And it's equally true that when any human relationship deteriorates, it tends to deteriorate
1750320	1752360	in the relationship of power.
1752360	1757640	If your marriage starts to become shaky, then you begin to exploit each other.
1757640	1759280	Use force.
1759280	1760360	You try to get your way.
1760360	1762080	You try to dominate.
1762080	1766200	It's the same within any family that's deteriorating into a state of pathology.
1766200	1768240	It's the same in any organization.
1768240	1772920	We've seen huge states deteriorate into the tyrannical use of power.
1772920	1787080	If you had to identify a cardinal attribute of mankind, power is a reasonable hypothesis.
1787080	1789120	But let's think about that for a minute.
1789120	1799480	So imagine that, well, imagine that it's sex that is and should be the complete story
1799480	1800480	of mankind.
1800480	1801960	Well, what does that mean exactly?
1802000	1805520	What's a world organized on that basis?
1805520	1808080	What does a world organized on that basis look like?
1808080	1810880	Well, there's nothing more important than sex.
1810880	1815080	Well, how about immediate sexual gratification whenever you want it?
1815080	1820320	How about immediate sexual gratification as the archetype of hedonism?
1820320	1824560	How about immediate sexual gratification whenever you want it, regardless of what anyone else
1824560	1826720	has to say about it?
1826720	1833840	Because if it's the story and it's the fundamental story, then what stops me from gaining access
1833840	1840280	to what I want right now, regardless of the cost to anyone else?
1840280	1844880	If there's nothing beyond that, if only the naive believe that there's anything noble
1844880	1849520	about humanity beyond the immediate demand of reproduction, then what have you got to
1849520	1854280	say that's moral about sex and why the hell shouldn't everybody just do exactly what they
1854280	1863080	want with whoever they want whenever they want all the time?
1863080	1866040	And with power, you can make exactly the same argument.
1866040	1872600	And classical societies, aristocratic societies, militaristic and martial societies are predicated
1872600	1873840	on this idea.
1873840	1881200	If I can push you around, all that indicates is that I should push you around because if
1881200	1887720	you're so weak that I can push you around, you have absolutely no ground whatsoever to
1887720	1890720	stand on to oppose me.
1890720	1896820	Because if you were moral by the traditions of power, I wouldn't be able to push you around.
1896820	1901120	And so it's very difficult to argue out of that from a rational perspective.
1901120	1903160	Why doesn't it make right?
1903160	1907120	And why isn't it only the weak who claim that that's wrong?
1907120	1910760	And why isn't it only that the weak claim that that's wrong?
1910760	1913200	Not because they're moral, but because they're weak.
1913200	1919040	That would certainly be a spin-off on the Nietzschean notion that will to power constitutes
1919040	1920960	the core of man.
1920960	1929680	And I would say up until the dawn of Judeo-Christian ethic, let's say, power ruled.
1929680	1932840	And then we could imagine what sort of world it's like when power rules.
1932840	1934360	Well, we know what that world's like.
1934360	1939960	It's like pay attention to the strongest or suffer the consequences.
1939960	1950160	Well, is there something beyond that that's not mere naivety?
1950160	1957520	What's if it isn't power that's the story, and if it isn't sex that's the story.
1957520	1960840	What's the story?
1960840	1968440	For the West, the answer to that is the library of the Bible.
1968440	1969880	That's the story.
1969880	1974840	It's the story upon which the West is founded.
1974840	1980960	It's the story that has arisen over thousands of years, tens of thousands of years, for
1980960	1990800	that matter, attempting to address the core issue.
1990880	1993320	What's the fundamental story?
1993320	1999960	It's no mystery to make the claim that the claim of the biblical library of stories,
1999960	2005320	because it is a library, is that it's the fundamental story.
2005320	2011880	All right, so we live in a story.
2011880	2016320	We've identified the competitors, power and sex.
2016320	2018840	What is it that's being expressed in the biblical story?
2018880	2024280	Look, if you go to a movie, you read a complex book, you go to a sophisticated movie, a
2024280	2030320	sophisticated play, a Shakespearean play, or you read a sophisticated work of fiction,
2030320	2034680	you see a multi-dimensional characterization, right?
2034680	2039240	A comic book has a hero with one motive.
2039240	2046880	A sophisticated work of fiction has a hero, and perhaps an anti-hero, with complex multi-dimensional
2046880	2048520	motivations.
2048520	2057040	Whatever characterizes those more realistic people isn't reducible to any single attribute.
2057040	2063440	And in a complicated work of fiction, the author walks you through a multi-dimensional
2063440	2064680	characterization.
2064680	2070920	You see the same person, the hero aiming upward, the anti-hero or villain aiming downward.
2070920	2075800	You see that person portrayed in multiple different situations.
2075800	2083520	And pursuing partial reflections of their ultimate aim.
2083520	2094800	And in consequence of that, you learn to understand and embody that complex of aims.
2094800	2099760	When you see a movie and you watch the hero, you're watching the hero to learn how to act
2099760	2101840	like a hero.
2101840	2106560	When you're watching a movie and you watch the anti-hero or the villain, you're watching
2106560	2113080	the movie to learn how not to fail catastrophically and land in hell while taking everyone else
2113080	2115880	along with you.
2115880	2123820	Is it reducible to something as simple as power or sex?
2123820	2126040	Not if it's not a comic book.
2126040	2128360	You need a multi-dimensional characterization.
2128360	2130800	All right.
2130800	2137920	The biblical corpus provides a multi-dimensional characterization of the fundamental aim of
2137920	2140720	man and cosmos.
2140720	2142120	That's the claim of the book.
2142120	2149120	So I'm going to walk you through some of the stories and show you what's being revealed.
2149120	2152120	What's being revealed is the proper object of worship.
2152120	2153120	Okay.
2153120	2154120	So what does that mean?
2154120	2155800	The proper object of celebration.
2155800	2161640	The aim towards which all sacrifices and work are to be directed.
2161640	2164640	That which should be held in the highest regard.
2164640	2169640	That which should be imitated in ritual and admiration.
2169640	2170640	Okay.
2170640	2175320	So that's the idea.
2175320	2185680	Admiration in the same way that a small child who hero worships the boy down the street who's
2185760	2195720	the baseball star because that boy portrays a pattern of skill and attention that is the
2195720	2200720	next appropriate developmental step for the hero worshiping child.
2200720	2204800	That's a recreation of the religious impulse.
2204800	2207760	The impulse to look up, admire, and imitate.
2207760	2212720	The question being to what should we address our attention upward looking, admire, and
2212720	2217160	imitate.
2217160	2228640	That highest possible object of apprehension and admiration is by definition God.
2228640	2231400	It's a definition.
2231400	2236360	It's the highest aim that lurks behind all proximal aims.
2236360	2237920	That's a good way of thinking about it.
2237920	2239960	It's the upward aim as such.
2239960	2241520	All right.
2241520	2243120	How do you bring that down to earth?
2243120	2245760	Well, let's start with Genesis one.
2245760	2253080	There's a characterization of God and man in Genesis one.
2253080	2257400	The story opens at the dawn of time, at the beginning of things.
2257400	2260000	That's not exactly the beginning of time.
2260000	2262960	That's usually how it's read, but it's more complex than that.
2262960	2268440	It's not only the beginning of time in the linear sense, but it's the beginning of all
2268440	2270160	things that begin.
2270160	2272920	This is what happens every time something begins.
2272920	2277800	This is what happens every time something new makes its entry into the world.
2277800	2284120	It's the continual beginning that continually unfolds, that happened and is happening now
2284120	2287240	and will always happen.
2287240	2299200	It's the pattern of the emergence of order out of chaos that makes itself manifest in
2299200	2303080	the form of your life.
2303080	2304880	How is the stage set?
2304880	2313600	The Spirit of God hovers over the water, over the deep.
2313600	2324200	You hear that in the Judeo-Christian tradition, God engenders the world ex nihilo out of nothing.
2324200	2326760	That's not how the story sets itself up.
2326760	2333160	It sets itself up with the Spirit of God hovering above the waters, but it's not water.
2333160	2334360	That's not the word.
2334360	2344880	Water is one of the symbolic images attempting to make what's being described clear using
2344880	2347240	a sequence of complex metaphors.
2347240	2354280	The word for the water over which the Spirit of God hovers is tohu-vabohu, or tehom, and
2354320	2356920	it means a lot of things.
2356920	2364440	It means the dragon that lives at the bottom of the deepest well.
2364440	2371000	It means the unplumbable depths of the most abysmal ocean.
2371000	2374240	It means the water that brings forth life.
2374240	2382040	It means the infinite well of possibility itself.
2382040	2388680	It means the confusion that rains when your world falls apart.
2388680	2399800	It means the unstructured day that makes itself manifest when you wake up.
2399800	2401240	It means all of that.
2401240	2408920	It means the dragon that the archaic God sliced into pieces and made the world from.
2408920	2416200	It means it's the hydra that Hercules defeats to form the world.
2416200	2418360	It's all of that.
2418360	2421200	So what does that mean?
2421200	2428760	It means that the Spirit of Being and Becoming generates the world from possibility.
2428760	2430240	What does that mean?
2430240	2432760	That's what your consciousness does.
2432760	2433760	That's what you do.
2433760	2438240	See, you think you're surrounded by a world of objects that you manipulate in a robotic
2438240	2444040	fashion, but you're not concerned with the objects that are static.
2444040	2449360	You're concerned with what you can dynamically transform when you wake up in the morning.
2449360	2456920	What presents itself to you is a field of indeterminate opportunity.
2456920	2462800	That's why you're worried or perhaps excited because you have something to grapple with
2462800	2465880	that hasn't yet come into being.
2465880	2469960	The possibilities of the day, and you might think, oh my God, I have so many things to
2469960	2470960	do.
2470960	2471960	I'm overwhelmed.
2471960	2472960	It's too much.
2472960	2474880	Well, that's the Tohu Vabohu.
2474880	2477000	That's the chaos and confusion.
2477000	2479280	That's a plethora of possibility.
2479280	2483800	You're thinking, oh my God, how many ways are there for things to go wrong?
2483800	2489560	Well, that's the multi-headed serpent that the hero always confronts.
2489560	2491080	And what do you have to do with that?
2491080	2494080	It's like, well, are you going to establish the order that you have to do with that?
2494080	2498760	Are you going to establish the order that's good in the course of the day?
2498760	2500840	Because that's what you're called upon to do.
2500840	2508040	And it's your recreation of what God himself does at the beginning of time that constitutes
2508040	2513560	the action of your conscious on the possibility that's in front of you.
2513560	2522680	You have a microcosm of plenitude and possibility right in front of you at any moment that you
2522680	2528480	can wrestle into order if your aim is right.
2528480	2539400	The process that God relies on to extract the cosmos, the order that's good, from the
2539400	2544720	well of unformed possibility is the word.
2544720	2546240	It's the logos.
2546240	2552120	What does that mean?
2552120	2557000	How much hell can you bring into being by saying the wrong words to your wife?
2557000	2563560	Right, now your wife is who she is, but she's also who she could become as you've no doubt
2563560	2565520	noticed many times.
2565520	2573120	And you can extract out something good or something terrible from the possibility she
2573120	2581680	represents with the cautious and loving application of your words or with the careful and prideful
2581680	2584240	and dismissive application of your words.
2584240	2590680	And the world you live in will be radically different depending on which of those two
2590680	2592360	approaches you apply.
2592360	2597560	And that will be exactly the same with anyone else you talk to and how you treat yourself
2597560	2601000	and how you interact with the world as such.
2601000	2611680	Because there's a provision of possibility that you're offered as a participant in the
2611680	2617520	process of creation that you formulate in accordance with your aim.
2617520	2622000	What's the insistence in Genesis 1?
2622000	2625120	Aim up with love.
2625120	2631680	So if you want to establish the paradise of your household in relationship to your wife
2631680	2639460	and your children, you aim at what's best for the best in them.
2639460	2643520	You offer them the security that you can imagine.
2643520	2646120	That's the walls of the walled garden.
2646120	2657220	And you present to them the challenge that allows them to unfold and develop optimally.
2657220	2663600	And you do that appropriately if you're aiming at what's best, what's highest.
2663600	2671400	And that's the spirit of God that makes itself manifest on the waters of possibility.
2671400	2681040	That's the embodiment, the source, the initial source, and the spirit of upward-aiming ultimate
2681040	2684600	love.
2684600	2691440	You can understand this by understanding what sort of walled garden you produce in your
2691440	2696840	own household with your aim.
2696840	2708040	God wrestles with the possibility that's not yet manifest and creates the cosmic order
2708040	2712440	as a consequence, in sequence.
2712440	2714880	Creating the fundamental divisions to begin with.
2714880	2717600	The separation of light and darkness.
2717600	2719560	That's the phenomenology of day and night.
2719560	2722000	The separation of the land from the waters.
2722000	2729880	The establishment of the dome of the sky over the disk of the earth populates the world
2729880	2745560	with its created beings and on the sixth day produces man and says in his own image.
2745560	2752120	So now we have a characterization of God who's the dynamic process that gives rise to
2752120	2759920	order from possibility itself in keeping with the highest possible aim.
2759920	2766280	And we have a characterization of the human being as a microcosm of that process.
2766280	2777200	The notion that each of us has a worth that's transcendental and not given by the state,
2777200	2785240	not given by yourself, not given by other individuals is predicated on that image.
2785240	2788480	I mean that historically and I mean it conceptually.
2788480	2797560	The notion is that, one of the notions is that the state itself has to grant to you
2797560	2807040	the worth of someone created in the image of the creator himself in order even for the
2807040	2812440	state to exist, maintain itself and transform.
2812440	2820700	That the state itself cannot function unless it establishes a sacred boundary between its
2820700	2827560	operations and the operation of the psyche, the human psyche, the human spirit that's
2827560	2833560	a manifestation of the God who generates the order that's good from possibility.

2893000	2897040	And you might ask, well, who believes that?
2897040	2905640	And I would say, try talking to one person once without believing that and see how it
2905640	2907240	goes.
2907240	2912300	We call to each other all the time, especially in our intimate relationships, to be treated
2912300	2918240	as if we are the locus of value.
2918240	2922840	And if you treat people that way, if you regard them that way, if you perceive them
2922840	2934080	that way, if you encourage them in that pathway of development, everything in your interactions
2934080	2940720	with human beings will open itself up to you and fill your life with abundance.
2940720	2943040	Everyone wants to be treated that way.
2943040	2948880	And the reason for that is, it's in keeping with our essential nature.
2948880	2962360	And that that hospitable, welcoming, encouraging, upward-aiming, loving treatment is the aim
2962360	2974600	and attitude upon which the soul, the community, and the natural order itself depends for its
2974600	2976640	integrity.
2976640	2980180	Your country is predicated on that notion.
2980180	2988760	The idea that each of you is endowed with inalienable rights and their requisite responsibilities
2988760	2992560	is a direct reflection of that conceptualization.
2992560	3000360	And one of the things you might frequently remind yourself of is the fact that your country
3000360	3007040	wouldn't be what it is, which is the closest approximation to a shining city on the hill
3007040	3014640	that's been established so far in the travail of mankind without that fundamental conception.
3014640	3017760	Right?
3017760	3021520	So then, you might say, well, is it true?
3021520	3026400	And the answer is, it's not hell.
3026400	3031000	I mean that because lots of countries are hell.
3031000	3036960	And they're hell in a way that opens up into an abyss and has the possibility of a deeper
3036960	3043240	abyss rating latent within it, which will open up with the possibility of a deeper abyss
3043240	3044720	within that.
3044720	3052040	And that's what happens when that fundamental characterization is overthrown in a revolutionary
3052040	3054760	manner or carelessly abandoned.
3054760	3062880	And we saw that for all of us who are non-believers and no longer conceptualize the metaphysical
3062880	3070320	hell as real, we saw the metaphysical hell realized in the 20th century many times in
3070320	3079880	case anyone having abandoned their metaphysical presuppositions was so blind that only an
3079880	3082440	object lesson would suffice.
3082440	3083760	Right?
3083760	3093200	Only Germany, the Soviet Union under Stalin, the Chinese Communist Party under Mao, if
3093200	3100520	that isn't close enough to hell for you, then I would say you should pray that you aren't
3100520	3111080	introduced to something even worse for the purposes of convincing you about what's real.
3111080	3121640	In the second, God announces two things, three things, four things once he creates man.
3121640	3127400	He says, man is to tend the garden, that's his purpose.
3127400	3128400	Why a garden?
3128400	3132600	It's a walled garden actually because that's what paradise means, walled garden.
3132600	3133600	Why a walled garden?
3133600	3139760	Well, a garden is a place of nature, obviously, and walls are a place of culture, and a walled
3139760	3147480	garden is a place of nature encapsulated in a manageable manner by the walls of culture.
3147480	3149040	That's what your backyard is.
3149040	3155200	It's a yard, it's nature, it has walls, the walls are culture, the walls you could think
3155200	3165200	of as physical entities, as objects, but your lawn has borders if you don't have a fence
3165200	3167920	and your neighbors know where the borders are and where are the borders?
3168280	3171400	Well, they're in the imagination of your neighbors.
3171400	3173920	I'm dead serious about that.
3173920	3177360	The walls, it's so funny because you'll see people in the border between Canada and the
3177360	3181840	United States, they'll get out and they'll step across the border.
3181840	3188840	It's like, as if it's an object, as if it's an entity that's there on the ground, and
3188840	3197520	people know that that's magic in some sense because the grass in Canada is only slightly
3197520	3204760	less healthy than the grass in the United States, let's say.
3204760	3210560	It's easy to concretize that, but the idea of a walled off space in a communal society
3210560	3213320	is a social agreement.
3213320	3217720	You have your domain, your house, your garden, your backyard.
3217720	3222080	That's enough cosmos for you to set right, and perhaps if you're competent enough to
3222080	3228440	do more, you'll expand your garden so that you have more to tend.
3228440	3237000	But you start with a walled garden of some size, and if you tend it properly, then the
3237000	3245560	promise is that as your competence grows, so will your dominion.
3245560	3250400	Man sent to tend the garden, and to name everything that's in it.
3250400	3251720	This is Adam.
3252160	3253240	What does that mean?
3253240	3254960	Well, it's the logos again.
3254960	3263000	It's a re-representation of the creative spirit of God that makes itself manifest when time
3263000	3266120	begins and when new things come into being.
3266120	3274400	Our ability to name, our ability to speak, is that in the microcosmic manner.
3274400	3279400	What we're capable of doing, that's what the patriarchal spirit does is name and order
3279400	3284600	the world, and God brings everything to Adam to see what he'll name them.
3284600	3293000	And that's a reflection of the idea that we have a created order, but man has a place
3293000	3298760	in it, and the place is to organize it and to put everything in its proper place and
3298760	3302240	to assign it its identity.
3302240	3309200	And that's no different than the prioritization of attention that's part of the story.
3309200	3311560	Name things in relationship to their function.
3311560	3323400	Put things in place in relationship to their significance in the hierarchy of being.
3323400	3329080	Orient them, orient all named things upward.
3329080	3334200	Sequence, constrain, organize, and order.
3334200	3337000	The manifestation of the patriarchal spirit.
3337000	3338400	What does God decide?
3338400	3341240	It's not good enough.
3341240	3343240	Man lacks a helper.
3343240	3346400	Man needs a helper.
3346400	3357600	Woman's created as a consequence because the order that men produce because of their limitations
3357600	3367280	is insufficient, and something has to be introduced to speak for that which is not included.
3367280	3369480	That's the role of woman.
3369480	3371800	That's the biblical role of the woman.
3371800	3374200	It's the biological role of the mother.
3374200	3378560	You know this in your own household.
3378560	3384200	Women bring the concerns of the marginalized to the center.
3384200	3389640	You can think about that politically, and it's useful to think about it politically.
3389640	3394400	All established human orders exclude.
3394400	3396920	The exclusion causes pain.
3396920	3401400	The pain of exclusion requires a voice.
3401400	3406160	That's the voice of the eternal mother.
3406160	3409760	That's where Genesis 1 ends.
3409760	3413720	Genesis 2 contains the story of Adam and Eve.
3413720	3416240	It's another creation story.
3416240	3420360	It's commensurate with the first one.
3420760	3425560	It's a variation on a theme.
3425560	3433560	God creates Adam out of matter, earth, and breath, spirit.
3433560	3434560	Why?
3434560	3435840	Because that's what human beings are.
3435840	3441160	We're material creatures that are animated.
3441160	3443480	Anima means spirit.
3443480	3446720	We...
3446720	3449600	What's the spirit?
3449600	3456160	The spirit is the living organizing principle of the material.
3456160	3462720	Human beings are an amalgam of the living organizing principle and the material.
3462720	3466760	That's what's portrayed in the creation of Adam.
3466760	3468760	The combination of matter and spirit.
3468760	3472200	The combination of material and conscious.
3472200	3475920	You could think about it that way if you're more secular minded.
3475920	3479560	We're conscious matter.
3479560	3481680	What's up with that?
3481680	3483200	No one understands that.
3483200	3485320	No materialist understands that.
3485320	3488200	We understand nothing about consciousness.
3488200	3492680	It's as mysterious now as it's been throughout the entire course of our existence.
3492680	3496240	It's never been reduced to material phenomenon.
3496240	3498440	We have no idea what that would even mean.
3498440	3502440	And if we did reduce it to the material, all that would mean was that we inadvertently
3502440	3505120	elevated the material.
3505120	3507480	We treat our each other like we're conscious.
3507480	3511320	We presume from first principles that we're conscious.
3511320	3516280	We can't even distinguish between being itself and being conscious.
3516280	3525000	And so that's a perfectly reasonable representation of man.
3525000	3531960	Woman is taken from man, from a rib, from the side as an equal.
3531960	3540440	There's a critique of patriarchal Judeo-Christian narrative from the resentful feminist side
3540440	3545320	that makes the claim that the biblical narrative is, for example, radically patriarchal in
3545320	3550520	its orientation, dooming women to subjugation.
3550520	3553920	That's a preposterous claim, by the way.
3553920	3556200	It's not only false.
3556200	3558080	It's false in a very particular way.
3558080	3562400	There are falsehoods that are approximations of the truth.
3562400	3567080	There are falsehoods so deep that they're the exact opposite of the truth.
3567080	3573760	And the truth of the matter is that right from the first words, the biblical library
3573760	3580600	is miraculous in its insistence that women like men are made in the image of God.
3580600	3582520	That emerges in the first chapter.
3582520	3593640	In that Eve is the equal of Adam in every manner, although complementary and not identical.
3593640	3602680	And our society is riven by conflict so deep that we now doubt both of those propositions.
3602680	3608520	There's no form of confusion more profound than that.
3608520	3612400	Sexually reproducing creatures without nervous systems can tell the difference between male
3612400	3613400	and female.
3613400	3621520	I'm dead serious about that.
3621520	3625800	If you can get people to swallow the lie that there's no difference between men and women,
3625800	3631080	there is no lie they won't swallow.
3631080	3634200	Right?
3634800	3644440	God makes Adam and Eve, each with their own role, and he puts them in the garden to play
3644440	3649200	forever under the watchful eye of their heavenly Father.
3649200	3653880	And he tells them they have free reign in the garden with everything delightful that's
3653880	3660520	being created, that's being created, except for one thing, they're not to eat the fruit
3660520	3668640	of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
3668640	3670040	So what does that mean?
3670040	3673720	Man, that's a mystery.
3673720	3681200	I spent a long time trying to crack the micro-narratives in the story of Adam and Eve, and it wasn't
3681200	3689120	until three or four years ago that I think I started to understand that particular fragment
3689120	3691120	of the story.
3691120	3695920	A friend of mine is here, Jonathan Pazzo, some of you might have been following him.
3695920	3703800	Jonathan and his brother Matthew really helped me crack this, and so we're here, I'm here
3703800	3708680	with Jonathan and a number of my other colleagues and friends right now with the Daily Wire recording
3708680	3710600	another seminar.
3710600	3715560	We released an Exodus seminar, we're recording a seminar in the Gospels right now, we're
3715560	3724040	about 60% of the way through that, and so just so you know, that's also forthcoming.
3724040	3730760	God tells human beings, he makes one fundamental rule, do not eat of the fruit of the tree
3730760	3732040	of the knowledge of good and evil.
3732040	3735160	Okay, that's moral knowledge.
3735160	3740560	That should be self-evident, knowledge of good and evil, that's moral knowledge.
3740560	3743840	Moral knowledge is predicated on the idea that there's an upward path and a downward
3743840	3747360	path, that there are desirable things and that there are undesirable things, and that
3747360	3752320	the pinnacle of what's desirable is what's heavenly or paradisal, and in the abysmal
3752320	3756680	depths of what's undesirable is the diabolical and the hellish.
3756680	3759680	And that's the moral landscape, that's the landscape of good and evil.
3759680	3767360	That's the fictional landscape, fictional in the sense of characterization and plot, fictional
3767360	3771880	in the sense of distilled truth, not falsehood.
3771880	3778360	Fictional in the sense that the fiction describes the structure through which you see the world.
3778360	3782280	Fiction as the deepest form of truth.
3782280	3788360	What does it mean to eat of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil?
3788360	3795600	When Nietzsche announced the death of God in the late 1800s, he said something that
3795600	3798880	he believed would constitute a pathway forward.
3798880	3805920	He said, we have dispensed with God, we are the greatest murderers who ever lived.
3805920	3813920	We've engaged in a murder so profound that we'll never wash away the blood.
3813920	3822240	How could we possibly conduct ourselves in the aftermath of that murder?
3822240	3826520	You read of Nietzsche as a triumphant anti-Christian.
3826520	3834280	He was a very complicated person and he knew perfectly well that the dissolution of the
3834280	3837800	Christian metaphysics would produce a cataclysmic consequence.
3837800	3845880	He predicted in the late 1800s that Europe would turn to a radically resentful egalitarian
3845880	3852560	communitarianism that would kill tens of millions of people, which is exactly what happened.
3852560	3857680	And he saw that coming just as clearly as his Russian counterpart Theodor Dostoevsky
3857680	3859000	saw it.
3859000	3862280	He knew what would rise in the aftermath of the death of God.
3862280	3869520	He knew that resentment and communitarianism would be one temptation.
3869520	3873080	And he tried to formulate an alternative path.
3873080	3876680	He said, we're going to have to create our own values.
3876680	3883320	We're going to have to take it upon ourselves to create the moral landscape.
3883320	3888040	I read that and I understood why he said that.
3888040	3893960	I could see its influence on clinical psychology, for example, the notion of the self-actualized
3893960	3900000	person, the notion that our soul should unfold in the direction that's commensurate with
3900000	3902960	the deepest understanding of our subjective selves, right?
3902960	3908400	The radical unveiling of subjectivity, self-definition.
3908400	3915960	I am what I say I am, which is a radical claim in our society now, a claim of omniscience.
3915960	3922000	Not only am I who I say I am, you better act like I'm who I say I am.
3922000	3924440	That's the claim of the radical subjective.
3924440	3926880	Well, what's wrong with that claim?
3926880	3930800	Well, the psychoanalysts criticized Nietzsche very effectively.
3930800	3934120	He said, look, how are you going to create your own values when you're not mastering
3934120	3935680	your own house?
3935680	3938600	Have you tried telling yourself what to do?
3938600	3940200	How does that work for you?
3940200	3942760	I know you're just your own obedient servant, right?
3942760	3943960	You're so morally pure.
3943960	3948360	You just tell yourself at New Year's that you're going to go to the gym and you're
3948360	3953960	going to diet and you're going to be some stellar, physique, lean, mean fighting machine
3953960	3960280	by March and you go once and then you tell yourself lies about why you don't have to
3960280	3962200	go again, and that's the end of that.
3962200	3973120	And if you were capable of creating your own values, you wouldn't be the banner, the
3973120	3977720	tattered banner that blows in the wind of its own whims.
3977720	3980240	The psychoanalysts figured this out very quickly.
3980240	3985760	You're a war of competing whims, and a creature like that's going to have a very difficult
3985760	3994120	time navigating the complex landscape of the ultimate moral pronouncement.
3994120	3997520	Who are you to make a decision about what constitutes good and evil?
3997520	3999960	And that's what God tells men and women.
3999960	4004280	It's like you don't get to create the moral order, you get to dwell within it.
4004280	4007560	You get to align yourself with the pre-existent moral order.
4007560	4017000	You do not take to yourself the right, the presumption to define good and evil themselves.
4017000	4026760	You bow your head to good and you pray for deliverance from evil.
4026760	4033160	And if you violate that, look the hell out, and that's the pronouncement.
4033160	4037080	And so what happens?
4037080	4042440	The serpent offers Eve the fruit.
4042440	4043680	Why the serpent?
4043680	4047560	Well the serpent is camouflaged.
4047560	4052720	The serpent is crafty, subtle.
4052720	4057280	The serpent is marginalized.
4057280	4059200	The serpent is the voice of pride.
4059200	4060960	The serpent is Lucifer.
4060960	4067560	That's the metaphysical surrounding of the story that develops over centuries the notion
4067560	4073400	that the serpent in the Garden of Paradise is Lucifer himself, the spirit of pride.
4073400	4074400	What does that mean?
4074400	4080720	It's prideful presumption that makes you assume that you can define the moral order.
4080720	4085880	What's the prideful presumption of Eve at the beginning of time and forever?
4085880	4089680	I can even clasp the serpent to my breast.
4089680	4100120	It's the careless welcoming in of the monstrous and prideful under the guise of the pretension
4100120	4101960	of maternal compassion.
4101960	4108440	And if you can't see that happening in our society, you're blind.
4108440	4112400	It might be easy to just toss all of your discipline to the side for the summer, but

4180800	4183840	And what's the sin of Adam?
4183840	4187200	Well, what do men care about?
4187200	4197160	Women care about, properly about, the helpless infant.
4197160	4202440	Men have powerful feminine virtue and it can be inverted and made prideful and trumpeted
4202440	4209920	and presumptuous to infantilize the world and to advertise that compassion as a badge
4209920	4218000	of worth and honor, as a mode of attaining status.
4218000	4220080	What's Adam's sin?
4220080	4221640	What do men care about?
4221640	4233040	Taking women, men are ambitious fundamentally to impress women, for better or for worse.
4233040	4242280	What's the prideful pathway and false pathway to establishing a relationship with the two
4242280	4245720	demanding feminine?
4245720	4248560	I've got it.
4248560	4250360	Anything you want, dear.
4250360	4251560	Right.
4251560	4253000	And that's Adam's sin.
4253000	4261080	He eve hearkens to the voice of the serpent and clutches it to her breast.
4261080	4267200	Despite the clear injunction from the divine, never to do that.
4267200	4274640	And Adam, weakly does exactly what the worst part of his wife wants.
4274640	4280640	And so here we are, folks.
4280640	4283000	So what's the consequence of that?
4283000	4289120	Well, the scales fall from the rise and they notice they're naked.
4289120	4292320	And they're deeply ashamed and they cover up.
4292320	4293320	They become self-conscious.
4293320	4298480	Okay, so when do people become self-conscious?
4298480	4301400	When they make prideful errors.
4301400	4307560	When you overreach and you reveal your inadequacy as a consequence of the mismatch between your
4307560	4309880	pride and your ability.
4309880	4312160	You'll be ashamed.
4312160	4315920	You'll recognize your insufficiency.
4315920	4320720	You'll be aware of yourself as an isolated entity.
4320720	4324080	That's all to become self-conscious.
4324080	4327280	Psychologists have learned over the last 40 years that there's no difference between being
4327280	4330280	conscious of yourself and being miserable.
4330280	4332840	Those are literally the same thing.
4332840	4341840	If you're living a life of other-centered, communally-oriented, hospitable calling, you're
4341840	4346440	not attending to the miseries of your isolated self.
4346440	4353960	If you stay in your bailiwick and you don't put forward your hand presumptuously, you can
4353960	4357280	live in the absence of painful self-consciousness.
4357280	4361200	Pride goes before a fall.
4361200	4366520	We have a month devoted to pride in our culture, right?
4366520	4367600	Pride goes before a fall.
4367600	4369640	You know this in your own life.
4369640	4375880	You can ask yourself, and this has been a Christian conundrum since the beginning of time, is
4375880	4380160	your life miserable because misery is baked into the structure of the world?
4380160	4385360	Or is your life miserable because you do stupid things and refuse to learn and bring endless
4385360	4388160	misery on yourself in your presumption?
4388160	4392200	You know, you might say a little of column A and a little of column B, and fair enough,
4392200	4399640	but you certainly know that the most painful episodes of your life come when you claim
4399640	4403200	falsely to be more than you are.
4403200	4414040	And the core narrative in the Christian, Judeo-Christian ethos is that the fall of man into the profane
4414040	4417120	world is a consequence of pride.
4417120	4419760	And that is really something worth thinking about.
4419760	4424560	You know, Adam and Eve are called upon to work in misery as a consequence of their pride.
4424560	4430440	Well, could you work joyfully if you didn't overreach yourself, if you were aiming upward
4430440	4434480	properly, if you were telling the truth, if you were acting communally, if you were acting
4434480	4439640	in relationship to what was highest, would it be possible that your work would be joyful
4439640	4441760	and bring abundance?
4441760	4444800	Isn't there times in your life when that's happened?
4444800	4450480	Is it the case that you move forward in misery in precise proportion to the pretension of
4450480	4453960	your aim?
4453960	4458160	It's worth considering.
4458160	4463680	It's the suspicion that arises at the end of the story that begins history because it's
4463680	4473440	with the prideful fall of Adam and Eve that history begins.
4473440	4476800	Adam and Eve discover they're naked and they hide.
4476800	4481080	And God comes along and says, Adam, where are you?
4481080	4485680	And Adam says, I'm over here, I'm hiding.
4485680	4487040	And God says, well, why are you hiding?
4487040	4489000	It's a foolish thing to do, right?
4489000	4492960	Because Adam is perfectly aware that God can see through bushes.
4492960	4494680	Adam is hiding from God.
4494680	4500440	Is it your pathetic self-consciousness that makes you hide from God?
4500440	4501600	That's a good question.
4501600	4507520	Are you not everything you could be because you're ashamed of who you are?
4507520	4509480	That's what that story indicates.
4509480	4512960	And so God calls Adam on, he says, who told you?
4512960	4513960	Why are you hiding?
4513960	4515160	And Adam says, well, I'm naked.
4515160	4520240	And God says, well, how do you find out that you were naked?
4520240	4523520	How did you find out that you were inadequate?
4523520	4527320	How did you find out that you are shameful?
4527320	4531160	And Adam says, you know that woman you made me?
4531160	4533000	It's her fault.
4533000	4534560	And that's the second sin of Adam.
4534560	4538880	And that's another indication of the non-patriarchal nature of the text.
4538880	4543760	You know, Eve is the first human being to take a bite of the apple, but Adam follows
4543760	4544760	along.
4544760	4549600	And it isn't obvious to me that the follower of sin is in a worse, better moral position
4549600	4551200	than the initiator.
4551200	4555960	And then he compounds his sin, like men do, by blaming the woman.
4555960	4556960	Why is your life so...
4556960	4559160	Well, if you had my wife, man, you'd know.
4559160	4560920	It's like those damn women.
4560920	4566280	It's like it's a handy excuse for men all the time to say that, and it's not least because
4566280	4571280	men can't tolerate being rejected by women, and women reject them all the time.
4571280	4575320	And the reason women reject them is because they're not all they should be.
4575320	4579800	And so, of course, that makes men painfully self-conscious and makes them shake their fist
4579800	4582240	at God and makes them hide.
4582240	4587680	And so, well, God says, and so Adam reveals himself in this pathetic manner.
4587680	4591520	It's like he can't even take responsibility for his own misstep.
4591520	4597680	He has to blame the thing that's been granted to him as the highest form of gift.
4597680	4601360	And not only her, but God.
4601360	4602360	Whose fault is it?
4602360	4603360	Well, it's not mine.
4603360	4605160	It's probably women's fault.
4605160	4607880	And if it's not women, it's clearly God.
4607880	4611320	It can't be me.
4611320	4612320	So what happens?
4612320	4616760	Well, both Adam and Eve are condemned to suffer in their work.
4616760	4619440	And that's how history begins.
4619440	4624840	And that's the situation of the fallen world.
4624840	4638080	And that's the description of the landscape of profound fiction that we inhabit.
4638080	4646640	And that's only a tiny fraction of the characterization of God and man in the biblical corpus.
4646640	4649640	Thank you very much.
