WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.420
It's the Hebrews created history as we know it.

00:06.420 --> 00:10.500
You don't get away with anything and so you might think you can bend the fabric of reality

00:10.500 --> 00:14.500
and that you can treat people instrumentally and that you can bow to the tyrant and violate

00:14.500 --> 00:16.120
your conscience without cost.

00:16.120 --> 00:17.420
You will pay the piper.

00:17.420 --> 00:22.100
It's going to call you out of that slavery into freedom even if that pulls you into the

00:22.100 --> 00:23.100
desert.

00:24.100 --> 00:30.700
And we're going to see that there's something else going on here that is far more cosmic

00:30.700 --> 00:33.180
and deeper than what you can imagine.

00:33.180 --> 00:41.460
The highest ethical spirit to which we're beholden is presented precisely as that spirit

00:41.460 --> 00:45.940
that allies itself with the cause of freedom against tyranny.

00:45.940 --> 00:46.940
Yes, exactly.

00:46.940 --> 00:48.460
I want villains to get punished.

00:48.460 --> 00:52.140
But do you want the villains to learn before they have to pay the ultimate price?

00:52.140 --> 00:54.140
That's such a Christian question.

01:05.140 --> 01:08.500
One of the reasons why I started working on the equipment is the way cattle were being

01:08.500 --> 01:10.660
handled was horrible.

01:10.660 --> 01:14.380
Electric prods on 100 percent of them falling down and crashing into things, people screaming

01:14.380 --> 01:16.140
at them.

01:16.140 --> 01:19.820
Cattle handling in the 80s was terrible, absolutely terrible.

01:19.820 --> 01:23.740
And I saw that as something that I could fix.

01:23.740 --> 01:28.220
Now I talked to a lot of young people today that want to do activism about some specific

01:28.220 --> 01:30.580
thing and it's way too broad.

01:30.580 --> 01:32.700
I want justice in the world, for example.

01:32.700 --> 01:33.700
Right, yes, yes.

01:33.700 --> 01:34.700
It might be something they would say.

01:34.700 --> 01:35.700
Yes, yes.

01:35.700 --> 01:40.060
And I say, why don't you do something more targeted, like using DNA to show that this

01:40.060 --> 01:43.100
prisoner was falsely accused?

01:43.100 --> 01:47.700
You see, now that's something a lot more targeted that you can actually do.

01:47.700 --> 01:49.500
Yes, absolutely.

01:49.500 --> 01:54.020
I think that is a huge problem with the way that kids are trained morally in universities

01:54.020 --> 02:02.060
is that that grandiose, vague activism replaces the actual practicalities of problem-solving

02:02.060 --> 02:04.260
that you're describing that actually make a difference.

02:04.260 --> 02:18.700
Hello, everyone.

02:18.700 --> 02:25.820
I'm usually excited to have whoever I'm talking to that day on my show because I pick people

02:25.820 --> 02:27.060
I'm excited about talking to.

02:27.060 --> 02:32.020
But I'm particularly excited about my guest today, Dr. Temple Grandin.

02:32.140 --> 02:37.740
Temple Grandin revolutionized the animal handling industry over the last 40 years and has done

02:37.740 --> 02:43.340
more for animal welfare in a practical sense than anybody that I know of and perhaps anybody

02:43.340 --> 02:44.340
on the planet.

02:44.340 --> 02:45.900
I think you could make a case for that.

02:45.900 --> 02:46.900
She's a remarkable person.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.660
I saw her first in Tucson, Arizona.

02:48.660 --> 02:51.300
I'll talk about that a little bit in our interview.

02:51.300 --> 02:55.540
She gave one of the most compelling presentations I'd ever seen in an academic setting at a

02:55.540 --> 02:59.460
conference on consciousness and saw that about 15 years ago.

02:59.460 --> 03:04.020
And ever since then, I'd really been wanting to meet her and I got to do that today, so

03:04.020 --> 03:05.340
that's so exciting.

03:05.340 --> 03:08.620
So I'll just give you a brief bio and we'll pop into the interview.

03:08.620 --> 03:15.140
Dr. Temple Grandin is a professor of animal sciences at Colorado State University.

03:15.140 --> 03:19.620
Facilities she has designed for handling livestock are used by companies all around the world.

03:19.620 --> 03:25.020
Her work has been instrumental in implementing animal welfare auditing programs, now used

03:25.020 --> 03:29.900
by McDonald's, Wendy's, Whole Foods, and many other major corporations.

03:29.900 --> 03:35.380
She has appeared on numerous shows across platforms such as 2020 Larry King Live and

03:35.380 --> 03:36.380
Prime Time.

03:36.380 --> 03:42.580
Dr. Grandin is also an accomplished author with books such as Thinking in Pictures,

03:42.580 --> 03:46.700
Livestock Handling in Transport, and The Autistic Brain.

03:46.700 --> 03:52.940
A few of her other publications, Animals in Translation, as well as Visual Thinking,

03:52.940 --> 03:55.900
have even made it to the New York Times bestseller list.

03:55.900 --> 04:02.460
In 2017, Dr. Grandin was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame, and in 2022,

04:02.460 --> 04:06.540
she was honored once again as a Colorado State Distinguished Professor.

04:06.540 --> 04:14.380
We're going to walk through her book today and we're going to learn what she has to

04:14.380 --> 04:17.380
say now about thinking.

04:17.380 --> 04:19.380
Let's start with Visual Thinking and Language.

04:19.380 --> 04:25.900
So do you want to tell people about your realization and about different thought patterns?

04:25.900 --> 04:31.780
When I was in my 20s, I thought everybody thought in pictures the way I thought.

04:31.780 --> 04:37.180
I didn't know that other people thought in words until I was in my late 30s.

04:37.180 --> 04:39.700
Now you've already mentioned how do I categorize?

04:39.700 --> 04:47.660
Well, I explain as a child how I learned to categorize, categorizing with individual pictures.

04:47.660 --> 04:54.820
So as a very young child, I categorized cats, dogs, and horses by size because in our neighborhood

04:54.820 --> 04:59.300
at that time, there were no cattle and there were no small dogs.

04:59.300 --> 05:05.940
Then a doxxant came into my neighborhood and she's the same size as a cat.

05:05.940 --> 05:10.540
And I remember looking at the doxxant, she was a black doxxant, and trying to figure

05:10.540 --> 05:16.300
out now what features does she share with the dog she barks.

05:16.300 --> 05:22.140
Her nose shape is the same as a dog and she smells like a dog.

05:22.140 --> 05:29.060
So I had to take other sensory-based things like smell and what the dog sounded like to

05:29.060 --> 05:33.500
put the doxxant in the dog category.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.060
So the way I formed categories is I have to have a bunch of information.

05:36.060 --> 05:43.780
Let's take the cat category and you look at a leopard's face, a lion's face, and even

05:43.780 --> 05:51.740
a house cat's face, there's similarities and they also smell all the same too.

05:51.740 --> 05:55.980
If you go to the zoo, you can smell how they are different.

05:55.980 --> 06:02.020
So the first step for abstract thinking is put making categories.

06:02.020 --> 06:09.100
So when I finally figured out that other people did not think in pictures, if I asked most

06:09.100 --> 06:13.860
people, visualize your own home, your dog, or your car, you will do it because you're

06:13.860 --> 06:16.780
so familiar with that.

06:16.780 --> 06:21.900
But one time at an autism conference, when I was in my late 30s, I asked a speech therapist

06:21.900 --> 06:27.940
think about a church staple and I was shocked that all the only image she saw was a very

06:27.940 --> 06:34.020
vague two lines like this, where I see specific churches.

06:34.020 --> 06:41.260
They come up like a series of back then 35 millimeter slides, now the PowerPoint slides.

06:41.260 --> 06:46.020
And then I can start as I see more and more of these churches, I can put them into New

06:46.020 --> 06:50.740
England type category, stone cathedral type.

06:50.740 --> 06:55.380
Looks like a warehouse and it has a little plastic steeple type.

06:55.380 --> 07:01.220
I can make finer categories as I get more and more specific images.

07:01.220 --> 07:05.860
It's bottom-up thinking and I learned that that's exactly how an artificial intelligence

07:05.860 --> 07:09.620
program diagnosis melanoma cancer.

07:09.620 --> 07:14.540
It's given a training set of 2,000 melanomas and another training set of every kind of

07:14.540 --> 07:19.180
skin rash and mosquito bite and infected whatever.

07:19.180 --> 07:24.020
And then it learns to categorize melanoma from non-melanoma.

07:24.020 --> 07:28.980
And that was very insightful to me when I learned that that's how the simple type of

07:29.060 --> 07:35.380
artificial intelligence programs work, diagnosing something like melanoma.

07:35.380 --> 07:41.500
So let me ask you, when I'm thinking something through, now I can think in pictures and if

07:41.500 --> 07:46.980
I'm building something or trying to design something to build, then I tend to think in

07:46.980 --> 07:47.980
pictures.

07:47.980 --> 07:55.980
But I would say 90% of the time my proclivity is to think in words and I would say in part

07:55.980 --> 08:03.980
that's because my word thinking is so dominant, it just suppresses the image thinking.

08:03.980 --> 08:09.540
And so a lot of my thinking, I would also say, takes the form of something like internal

08:09.540 --> 08:11.540
argumentation.

08:11.540 --> 08:17.820
So I'll ask myself a question, I'll think up an answer in words and then I'll think

08:17.820 --> 08:22.740
up a bunch of reasons why that answer isn't sufficient and then I'll conduct an internal

08:22.740 --> 08:23.740
argument.

08:23.740 --> 08:29.060
And that's occupying me continually, like 16 hours a day non-stop.

08:29.060 --> 08:34.180
And it's been like that ever since I was two years old, except for those times, let's say.

08:34.180 --> 08:44.100
So yeah, so how do you conduct internal arguments or what accounts for the...

08:44.100 --> 08:48.020
So part of the creativity in my thinking is the outcome of these arguments.

08:48.020 --> 08:53.940
What you're thinking in pictures, so you're not having internal arguments, what's the

08:53.940 --> 08:55.820
stream of your thought like?

08:55.820 --> 09:02.260
Well, when it comes to things like designing equipment, I often will kind of, a lot of

09:02.260 --> 09:05.820
equipment design, someone gets an idea from something else.

09:05.820 --> 09:10.780
And one of my other books I wrote about the inventor of Velcro and he saw how Burdock

09:10.780 --> 09:16.740
stuck on his clothes, cockled birds on those kind of things stuck on his clothes.

09:16.740 --> 09:20.260
And that's where he got the idea for making Velcro.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.060
That would be visual thinking.

09:23.060 --> 09:29.620
The Burdocks and Velcro, they've got similarities on how they stick together.

09:29.620 --> 09:33.900
In designing equipment, I can just see how it operates.

09:33.900 --> 09:40.220
I worked with welders that had 20 patents each that barely graduated from high school,

09:40.220 --> 09:45.460
but they could build any kind of a machine and invent industrial machinery.

09:45.460 --> 09:48.700
They just see it in their head.

09:48.700 --> 09:55.020
Right now, will you see, okay, so I read Nikolai Tesla's biography a long while back and it

09:55.020 --> 10:01.660
was extremely interesting and he claimed, and I have no reason to disbelieve him, that

10:01.660 --> 10:09.560
entire inventions, machines would pop into the theater of his imagination, detailed out

10:09.560 --> 10:14.580
to the point where he knew the angles on the screws that held the metal together.

10:14.580 --> 10:20.020
And he would try to write them down in something, draw them out in something approximating,

10:20.020 --> 10:25.580
something that you could make a blueprint out of, let's say, in that much detail.

10:25.580 --> 10:30.460
And sometimes a new invention would pop into his head so quickly that it would obliterate

10:30.460 --> 10:32.100
the previous one.

10:32.100 --> 10:34.460
He had to work very quickly to keep up.

10:34.460 --> 10:39.620
And so there's that incredible fluency in visualization.

10:39.620 --> 10:46.660
But then, as I said, in the verbal world, I'll think of an argument and counterarguments.

10:46.660 --> 10:52.780
When you're thinking of industrial design, do you think of the object that you're attempting

10:52.780 --> 10:57.020
to design and then multiple variants of it and test them against each other, or does

10:57.020 --> 11:01.140
it just come to you as a solution for a given problem?

11:01.140 --> 11:04.500
It almost sort of just pops into my head.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.260
I also see mechanical abnormalities.

11:06.460 --> 11:10.540
I remember walking in and someone had made a cardboard, old-fashioned locomotive.

11:10.540 --> 11:16.540
The wheels have those links between them, and I go, they drew that wrong.

11:16.540 --> 11:17.540
Wheels are not going to turn.

11:17.540 --> 11:23.180
It was just a cartoon train for a party.

11:23.180 --> 11:26.300
But I immediately noticed that they didn't draw it right.

11:26.300 --> 11:31.300
The other thing is, is my thinking is associative.

11:31.300 --> 11:33.100
All right.

11:33.100 --> 11:37.740
Give me a key word, pretend I'm Google for images.

11:37.740 --> 11:44.300
Not something I can see in here with books and papers all around and photography equipment

11:44.300 --> 11:48.540
and stuff all around me, but something kind of a creative key word.

11:48.540 --> 11:56.580
And I'll tell you how I access my memory for that key word.

11:56.580 --> 11:59.820
Start the new year off right with black rifle coffee.

11:59.820 --> 12:04.060
Black rifle has all the best brewing gear, thermos, mugs, and apparel designed for folks

12:04.060 --> 12:06.980
who love country and coffee.

12:06.980 --> 12:10.660
Black rifle sources the most exotic roasts from around the globe.

12:10.660 --> 12:15.900
All coffee is roasted here in the U.S. by veteran-led teams of coffee experts.

12:15.900 --> 12:20.660

12:47.180 --> 12:52.660
So and with regard, so my wife has a very powerful visual imagination.

12:52.660 --> 12:57.540
She's able to do all sorts of remarkable things with it.

12:57.540 --> 13:03.860
And one of the things that strikes me as highly probable is that her capacity for visual imagery

13:03.860 --> 13:06.540
is a lot more intense than mine.

13:06.540 --> 13:13.260
And so like I was a fairly vivid dreamer for years, especially when I was reading Carl

13:13.260 --> 13:15.540
Jung's work in graduate school.

13:15.540 --> 13:19.860
Don't seem to dream much now or not, well, I don't remember them much now.

13:19.860 --> 13:25.900
When I do think in pictures, it's not as vivid as seeing the real world.

13:25.900 --> 13:28.580
It's maybe 5% of that.

13:28.580 --> 13:34.100
It's sort of, it's, it's, well, it just doesn't have that intensity.

13:34.100 --> 13:35.780
What about, and you, and you?

13:35.780 --> 13:38.580
Oh no, it's very, very vivid.

13:38.580 --> 13:44.420
And, and while I was, while you were setting up all the camera equipment, here I found on

13:44.420 --> 13:46.020
here's a whole bunch of papers.

13:46.020 --> 13:51.260
More papers I've found online supporting the, a lot of the things that are in the book.

13:51.260 --> 13:56.500
I just got surfing around and boy, you can sometimes find some great stuff when you look

13:56.500 --> 13:57.500
at the citations.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.500
No, but it's very, very vivid.

13:59.500 --> 14:02.940
I don't know, it's, it's completely vivid.

14:02.940 --> 14:08.700
Now when you mentioned the word imagination, I remember going to a long time ago, Disney

14:08.700 --> 14:15.100
World, a kind of a ride that had imagination with people and dirigibles and things like

14:15.180 --> 14:16.180
that.

14:16.180 --> 14:21.100
You know, then I visited a studio where they, where Disney made a whole bunch of their stuff.

14:21.100 --> 14:22.100
I'm now seeing that.

14:22.100 --> 14:24.580
Yes, I'm now seeing a non-disclosure agreement.

14:24.580 --> 14:27.740
So I can't tell you what I did there.

14:27.740 --> 14:36.580
And I, but I, now I'm seeing a very interesting discussion we had about designing things where,

14:36.580 --> 14:40.820
where you're designing things, there's the decoration part of it.

14:40.820 --> 14:44.340
And then there's, then there's a mechanical part of, of a machine.

14:44.460 --> 14:49.020
Of course, at an amusement park, you want to have decorations, but you also, the rides

14:49.020 --> 14:50.660
have to mechanically work.

14:50.660 --> 14:55.980
They're kind of two separate things that were kind of done by two separate departments.

14:55.980 --> 15:02.500
You also spoke in your book about your ability to see things out of place.

15:02.500 --> 15:09.780
And so one of the things that characterizes autism is the fact that at least some autistic

15:09.780 --> 15:15.700
people are not very happy when they walk into a room, say that they're familiar with

15:15.700 --> 15:17.500
and one thing is out of place.

15:17.500 --> 15:23.420
So for example, an autistic child might walk into a dining room and one of the chairs is,

15:23.420 --> 15:27.420
you know, tilted 45 degrees to the right or to the left instead of being put straight

15:27.420 --> 15:28.420
in.

15:28.420 --> 15:34.140
And what seems to happen, correct me if, if you feel that I'm wrong, is that the fact

15:34.140 --> 15:41.100
that that chair is now askew means that the entire room is different in some important

15:41.100 --> 15:43.100
and emotionally significant way.

15:43.100 --> 15:45.220
So there's this response to anomaly.

15:45.220 --> 15:46.700
I don't have that issue.

15:46.700 --> 15:53.500
That's not an issue for me, but if there's one pixel off on an electronic sign, I will

15:53.500 --> 15:54.500
notice that.

15:54.500 --> 16:01.340
I remember one time walking into the airport with somebody else and the United Ticket Counter

16:01.340 --> 16:05.340
sign was a whole row of television monitors.

16:05.340 --> 16:10.220
And there must have been 20 TV monitors making the word United over and over again.

16:10.220 --> 16:13.900
And one of the screens was scrambled, the whole screen.

16:13.900 --> 16:17.900
And I immediately saw it and I said to the person beside me, did you see that that sign

16:17.900 --> 16:19.180
was messed up?

16:19.180 --> 16:21.420
No, they did not see it.

16:21.420 --> 16:24.260
They were right beside me when we walked in.

16:24.260 --> 16:25.460
I immediately saw it.

16:25.460 --> 16:29.660
Now that it upset me, no, I just noticed that the sign was scrambled.

16:29.660 --> 16:30.660
Right.

16:30.660 --> 16:31.780
But it didn't upset you.

16:31.780 --> 16:32.780
No.

16:32.780 --> 16:36.300
So yeah, so that's that interesting.

16:36.300 --> 16:41.700
So for me, I think I can detect anomalies visually.

16:41.700 --> 16:47.300
So for example, one of the things I learned to do when I was setting up my house and renovating

16:47.300 --> 16:53.180
places and setting up my offices, like arranging my local environment, was to sit in the room

16:53.180 --> 16:56.940
and become meditative in some sense.

16:56.940 --> 17:04.460
And then to feel out what was bothering me about the room, like what ugly feature might

17:04.460 --> 17:08.060
pop out, what part of it needed to be attended to.

17:08.060 --> 17:09.060
Right.

17:09.060 --> 17:15.820
And I think I was tuning myself to detect what was abnormal in relationship to the underlying

17:15.820 --> 17:19.140
aesthetic or the pattern of the room.

17:19.140 --> 17:24.020
But that pops out for you almost instantaneously.

17:24.020 --> 17:26.300
For me, anomaly detection is mostly verbal.

17:26.300 --> 17:31.500
Again, it's like all think up an argument and then think up counter arguments.

17:31.500 --> 17:37.580
And if one argument and the other don't jive, if they're contradictory, then that pops out

17:37.580 --> 17:38.580
for me.

17:38.580 --> 17:45.020
Well, it's sort of like I fly all the time to like I know when the pilots do the checklist.

17:45.020 --> 17:51.300
And like we push back, and we just take too long to turn, I'm going, uh-oh, we're going

17:51.300 --> 17:53.700
to have an air traffic control delay.

17:53.700 --> 17:59.940
And I can often predict that before they announce it.

17:59.940 --> 18:06.220
And I also can, I'm very conscious of on the biggest airplane, when they start the little

18:06.220 --> 18:09.820
gentle push to push it back from the gate, I can feel it on the biggest aircraft there

18:09.820 --> 18:10.820
is.

18:10.820 --> 18:11.820
Right.

18:11.820 --> 18:20.940
And I just want to get there and I'm going, oh, please push back.

18:20.940 --> 18:23.700
But it's sort of like I don't get upset about it.

18:23.700 --> 18:27.140
It's just anything that's not routine.

18:27.140 --> 18:32.580
I instantly notice it and I go, oh, crap, I see a vest that says tech ops.

18:32.580 --> 18:35.180
We may have a delayed flight.

18:35.180 --> 18:37.900
Now that brings up another thing I want to talk about.

18:37.900 --> 18:43.620
In the last month, I've had, okay, a mechanic come on a plane twice and both mechanics had

18:43.620 --> 18:45.060
gray hair.

18:45.060 --> 18:51.580
And this brings up a major issue that's in my book about skill loss, especially skill

18:51.580 --> 18:54.380
loss with mechanical things.

18:54.380 --> 19:00.100
I've been on a lot of questionable elevators and escalators lately that definitely needed

19:00.100 --> 19:02.300
servicing.

19:02.300 --> 19:06.980
And what's happening, and this is in my screened out chapter, is the kids are getting screened

19:06.980 --> 19:11.700
out of these trades because they've taken the shop classes out of the schools 20 years

19:11.700 --> 19:17.060
ago and we have so many higher math requirements that you don't need for something like fixing

19:17.060 --> 19:22.820
elevators that the kids are playing video games in the basement on an autism diagnosis

19:22.820 --> 19:25.060
instead of fixing elevators.

19:25.060 --> 19:29.940
There's a relationship here between what goes on with industrial things and what's going

19:29.940 --> 19:35.540
on at school, which is a major, major thing that I'm interested in talking about.

19:36.260 --> 19:39.380
Yeah, so let's talk about that a little bit.

19:39.380 --> 19:43.260
That's one of the things that popped out for me from your book.

19:43.260 --> 19:45.860
So I was trying to think that through.

19:45.860 --> 19:51.220
So you make the claim as you just laid out that our education system and maybe our entire

19:51.220 --> 19:59.100
culture as it's hypothetically deindustrializing is actually working against the best interests

19:59.100 --> 20:04.460
of those who think mechanically, those who think in pictures, and those who can do hands

20:04.580 --> 20:05.580
on work.

20:05.580 --> 20:11.700
And here's a paper I just dug off of Google Scholar on visual objectability, a new dimension

20:11.700 --> 20:13.780
of nonverbal intelligence.

20:13.780 --> 20:20.340
And what a lot of educators don't understand is that object visualization, especially on

20:20.340 --> 20:25.220
solving mechanical problems, it is a different way of thinking.

20:25.220 --> 20:29.540
I worked with people that barely graduated from high school, stutterers.

20:29.540 --> 20:31.060
They'd be labeled autistic to date.

20:31.060 --> 20:37.100
They'd be in special ed, but they had big metal working shops and 20 patents each for

20:37.100 --> 20:41.580
mechanically complicated equipment that they are selling around the world.

20:41.580 --> 20:47.180
And this is something that educators just don't get it.

20:47.180 --> 20:53.260
And the reason why I wrote this book, I'll tell you what was the reason.

20:53.260 --> 21:00.420
In 2019, just before COVID shut everything down, I went to four places and I realized

21:00.420 --> 21:03.340
the magnitude of the skill loss.

21:03.340 --> 21:09.900
The first one was a pork processing plant where most of the equipment came from Holland.

21:09.900 --> 21:14.140
I went to another pork processing plant, equipment coming from Holland.

21:14.140 --> 21:18.180
Then I went to a poultry processing plant where all of the specialized equipment came

21:18.180 --> 21:21.500
from Holland, 100 shipping containers.

21:21.500 --> 21:26.780
And then I went to the Steep Jobs Theater and the structural glass walls are from Italy

21:26.780 --> 21:27.780
and Germany.

21:27.780 --> 21:33.620
Then, after reading more stuff, I found out that the state-of-the-art electronic chip-making

21:33.620 --> 21:36.420
machine comes from Holland.

21:36.420 --> 21:40.380
And that goes back to their educational system.

21:40.380 --> 21:44.740
They don't stick their nose up at the high-end skilled trades and look at it sort of like

21:44.740 --> 21:47.060
a lesser form of intelligence.

21:47.060 --> 21:52.380
When the kids get to about ninth grade, they can go university route or they can go tech

21:52.380 --> 21:53.380
route.

21:53.380 --> 21:58.740
They're going to emphasize high-end skilled trades where you're really using that visual

21:58.740 --> 22:03.100
thinking for mechanical devices.

22:03.100 --> 22:07.260
So I was trying to think through why this might be happening.

22:07.260 --> 22:12.020
So let me offer some hypotheses to you and you tell me what you think about this.

22:12.020 --> 22:19.600
So first of all, we have learned and you draw on Simon Baron Cohen's work in your book.

22:19.600 --> 22:25.800
We have learned that there is a difference and we can try to map this on to verbal thinking

22:25.800 --> 22:28.560
versus imagistic thinking.

22:28.560 --> 22:36.560
Simon Baron Cohen talked about systemizing versus empathizing and he considers that something

22:36.560 --> 22:42.160
akin to the continuum between autistic thinking and normal thinking.

22:42.160 --> 22:49.240
So the autistic types are more systematizing and my suspicions are they're also the ones

22:49.280 --> 22:52.520
who are more likely to think in images in the manner that you described.

22:52.520 --> 22:53.520
Wait a minute.

22:53.520 --> 22:58.400
Now we've got two kinds of thinking in images.

22:58.400 --> 23:02.680
And there's a nice paper that just came out relatively recently, seeing and thinking in

23:02.680 --> 23:08.800
pictures, a review of visual information processing that came out in 2018, I'd like to keep my

23:08.800 --> 23:10.680
stuff up to date.

23:10.680 --> 23:17.400
Now I think in photorealistic pictures where the more mathematical type of thinking thinks

23:17.440 --> 23:19.480
in patterns.

23:19.480 --> 23:22.960
See in your brain you've got circuits for what is something.

23:22.960 --> 23:26.320
OK, so I see a dog and I go, yeah, that's a dog.

23:26.320 --> 23:32.760
Or I've got some china ceramic cattle on my coffee table here.

23:32.760 --> 23:36.200
OK, and I just look at the animals and name them.

23:36.200 --> 23:39.640
Then the visual spatial is where is something?

23:39.640 --> 23:42.560
Where are you located in space?

23:42.560 --> 23:46.600
There are actually two different kinds of visualization.

23:46.640 --> 23:54.240
And I have a whole chapter in visual thinking book about this and research to back this up.

23:54.240 --> 24:01.400
Now the visual spatial type pattern thinking or sort of where is something in space, those

24:01.400 --> 24:04.800
kids do well in math, so they're going to stem right.

24:04.800 --> 24:08.360
But let me tell you what's going on out in the food processing plants.

24:08.360 --> 24:12.400
The people I've worked with in the big steel shops now that a lot of us closed down, we

24:12.400 --> 24:18.000
are paying the price now for taking out the shop classes on designed mechanically clever

24:18.000 --> 24:19.600
equipment.

24:19.600 --> 24:23.400
The people I've worked with in May, we never worked on boilers or refrigeration, we don't

24:23.400 --> 24:25.320
understand that stuff.

24:25.320 --> 24:31.440
That requires a lot more mathematical thinking or this load on the roof so the factory doesn't

24:31.440 --> 24:34.080
fall down if we get two feet of snow.

24:34.080 --> 24:38.400
You see then I have seen this division of engineering labor in every single meat company

24:38.400 --> 24:39.400
I have worked with.

24:39.400 --> 24:40.400
They're all the same.

24:40.400 --> 24:47.760
So do you think that's a matter of like let's say something approximating focal depth?

24:47.760 --> 24:56.600
So is it possible that the first kind of people that you talked about are dealing at the object

24:56.600 --> 24:57.600
level itself?

24:57.600 --> 25:01.600
So they're dealing say with a boiler or with a particular piece of equipment whereas the

25:01.600 --> 25:05.400
other types are dealing with the relationship between pieces of equipment?

25:05.400 --> 25:07.400
No, you don't think that's it?

25:07.400 --> 25:09.400
No, I think it's just real simple.

25:09.400 --> 25:15.160
You just see the objects and then after you work, you see an object visualizer gets better

25:15.160 --> 25:20.000
and better at designing mechanical equipment, the more things you go out and see.

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
When I started working my designing cattle handling facilities, I went to every feed yard

25:24.000 --> 25:29.880
in Arizona and I worked cattle and I go this kind of a design doesn't work, this worked

25:29.880 --> 25:33.040
so then I took all the good bits and like recombined them.

25:33.040 --> 25:34.240
It's bottom up thinking.

25:34.240 --> 25:38.920
The more stuff I get exposed to, okay, whether it's cattle handling facility or maybe I'll

25:38.960 --> 25:43.160
look at how water flows through something and then you watch how cattle move.

25:43.160 --> 25:51.160
I'd like to look at drone footage and a lot of that resembles water flow and the visual

25:51.160 --> 25:54.600
spatial, they see patterns.

25:54.600 --> 26:03.160
It's actually very different and what we're losing is the object visualizer.

26:03.160 --> 26:08.000
That person that can just, you see, I'm very aware of things like I go in an elevator now

26:08.080 --> 26:11.400
that hasn't been serviced and it's scraping in the shaft, you better believe it.

26:11.400 --> 26:16.080
I hear it and I go, they haven't serviced that elevator.

26:16.080 --> 26:22.040
I was at a fancy hotel recently and the bell hop goes, oh, it skips that floor.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.120
We have to get that floor on the way down.

26:24.120 --> 26:27.360
Yeah, real nice hotel, major city.

26:27.360 --> 26:29.120
Right, right.

26:29.120 --> 26:33.520
Okay, so let me, I don't quite understand that distinction yet so I'm going to, I'm

26:33.520 --> 26:35.080
going to push a little bit more on that.

26:35.080 --> 26:42.520
So on the visual side, you have the visual spatial types, if I'm remembering this correctly,

26:42.520 --> 26:44.680
and that's the category that you fall into.

26:44.680 --> 26:48.640
And then you have people who are, what are they, higher up on the abstraction chain in

26:48.640 --> 26:51.240
some sense, the ones who can think more mathematically?

26:51.240 --> 26:55.840
No, but basically, object visualizers, I can tell you this from experience, we're good

26:55.840 --> 26:59.360
at mechanical devices, art, photography.

26:59.360 --> 27:04.920
I have talked to many, many photographers because I do a lot of interviews, find out

27:04.920 --> 27:09.200
they're dyslexic, they're about flunked out of school, and fortunately somebody introduced

27:09.200 --> 27:10.560
them to photography.

27:10.560 --> 27:13.920
And the other thing that my kind of mind's good at is animals.

27:13.920 --> 27:18.320
Then your visual spatial, mathematics, algebra, I can't do algebra.

27:18.320 --> 27:20.480
There's nothing there to visualize.

27:20.480 --> 27:25.080
Mathematics, calculus, I took a computer programming course when I was in college.

27:25.080 --> 27:27.120
I couldn't do it, I had to drop it.

27:27.120 --> 27:31.840
I was exposed to the same exact computer that Bill Gates had, and he could do it and I had

27:31.840 --> 27:35.000
to drop the class.

27:35.000 --> 27:41.040
These are the things that the more mathematical pattern thinking mind is good at.

27:41.040 --> 27:45.440
And some of these really smart kids, they can just look at algebra formulas and just see

27:45.440 --> 27:46.440
it.

27:46.440 --> 27:48.400
They don't have to do it step by step, they just see it.

27:48.400 --> 27:52.080
And that's how they think, and then the teachers try to make them do it step by step.

27:52.080 --> 27:54.240
That gets the kids frustrated.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.120
They don't think the same way.

27:56.760 --> 28:01.400
And so my thinking is also associative, I tend to jump around.

28:01.400 --> 28:04.600
But there's a logic to the association.

28:04.600 --> 28:08.680
And I think the best way to illustrate that associative kind of thinking is give me a

28:08.680 --> 28:14.560
single keyword, like I'm Google for images, and think of a creative keyword.

28:14.560 --> 28:20.840
And I will tell you exactly how my mind associates and how my mind can get off the subject, but

28:20.840 --> 28:24.760
there is a logic to the getting off of the subject.

28:24.760 --> 28:27.360
So give me a keyword, a single keyword.

28:27.360 --> 28:30.000
Okay, how about rows?

28:30.000 --> 28:36.480
Okay, I'm seeing rows bushes that we had in our backyard when I was a child.

28:36.480 --> 28:39.680
And we had a lot of thorns on them.

28:39.680 --> 28:42.200
And we also like to dig around in the grass that was back there.

28:42.200 --> 28:49.360
So now I'm seeing the grass behind our house, we used to go play in it and catch some insects

28:49.360 --> 28:50.360
sometimes.

28:50.360 --> 28:53.600
Okay, now you can see how it's jumping around.

28:53.600 --> 28:59.160
I don't have that big a visual library of roses.

28:59.160 --> 29:04.640
So then I tend to then go to something else.

29:04.640 --> 29:06.720
But how about cows?

29:06.720 --> 29:07.720
What?

29:07.720 --> 29:08.720
Cows.

29:08.720 --> 29:14.960
All right, now I'm seeing like 10 cow statues right here in front of me.

29:14.960 --> 29:19.080
And so obviously those are coming up in my mind.

29:19.080 --> 29:21.360
Just recently, I tend to bring up recent memories.

29:21.360 --> 29:27.000
I visited with a black Angus bull, it was a pet, and he wasn't very happy with us because

29:27.000 --> 29:28.920
we didn't bring him any carrots.

29:28.920 --> 29:34.800
So my friend gave him one of those disgusting soy protein bars and he goes, not going to

29:34.800 --> 29:35.800
eat that.

29:35.800 --> 29:39.280
I wouldn't eat it, no matter how much we tried to feed it to him.

29:39.280 --> 29:43.560
And he was annoyed because we didn't bring him any carrots.

29:44.560 --> 29:49.400
Okay, now I've got the carrot word in my head.

29:49.400 --> 29:54.640
And when I was in fourth grade, I used my singer Sohandi to sew green crepe paper so

29:54.640 --> 29:56.360
students could be carrots.

29:56.360 --> 30:01.360
And I made the green carrot tops out of green crepe paper.

30:01.360 --> 30:04.720
So that's how I got the cattle to carrot.

30:04.720 --> 30:11.200
So talking to you that way reminds me very much of what used to happen in my therapy

30:11.200 --> 30:15.320
sessions when I was helping people interpret their dreams.

30:15.320 --> 30:22.720
And so dreams have the same quality of thought that your thought had when you just put it

30:22.720 --> 30:23.920
on display there.

30:23.920 --> 30:27.560
So because the dream tends to be an intermingling.

30:27.560 --> 30:33.560
So imagine there's a center category and the nature of the category is somewhat unclear.

30:33.560 --> 30:36.360
Maybe that's partly what the dream is trying to puzzle out.

30:36.440 --> 30:42.080
What you get is a web of associations, some of which are autobiographical, that are sort

30:42.080 --> 30:44.760
of circulating around a main theme.

30:44.760 --> 30:49.960
And partly what you do when you analyze a dream is you walk through all the associated

30:49.960 --> 30:50.960
images.

30:50.960 --> 30:56.840
You also ask the person to let their mind loose to generate more associations.

30:56.840 --> 31:02.560
And then you try to use the associational web to triangulate on the central theme and

31:02.560 --> 31:03.920
to haul out the gist.

31:03.920 --> 31:09.000
And the gist of that array of images would be something like the interpretation of the

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
dream.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.040
If you get it right, then it snaps into people.

31:12.040 --> 31:15.640
They think, oh yes, that's definitely what that was about.

31:15.640 --> 31:21.240
But the dream is attempting to put something together that has a central category of structure.

31:21.240 --> 31:26.960
Well, now there also are sensory things because I have some balance issues.

31:26.960 --> 31:31.400
So I often get dreams where I'm riding a bike down a hill that's super steep like that.

31:31.400 --> 31:33.520
And I wish I wasn't doing that.

31:33.520 --> 31:37.280
And I know that that has to do with the fact that I have balance issues.

31:37.280 --> 31:41.920
I don't think it means anything, but I'm always up on some high place that I wish I wasn't

31:41.920 --> 31:45.960
up on and I've got to try to walk down it.

31:45.960 --> 31:50.280
And then I have other dreams where I can see it might have some meaning and other times

31:50.280 --> 31:53.280
of where it doesn't.

31:53.280 --> 31:58.320
But the other thing with my thinking, when I'm working on design work, I can control

31:58.320 --> 32:00.560
the associations.

32:00.560 --> 32:02.480
I can control them.

32:02.480 --> 32:06.520
I've had before, there's now 3D simulations.

32:06.520 --> 32:11.640
Okay, let's say the company that's building this plant wants to show off how the equipment

32:11.640 --> 32:12.640
works.

32:12.640 --> 32:16.920
They can do a 3D simulation showing how the equipment works.

32:16.920 --> 32:20.320
I can remember sitting in a conference room when we were trying to discuss how to do some

32:20.320 --> 32:23.440
conveyors.

32:23.440 --> 32:26.680
And the other guys there are coming up with ideas for the conveyors and going, no, no,

32:26.680 --> 32:29.320
if you do that, you're going to yank the rails out of the ceiling.

32:29.320 --> 32:31.520
Oh, no, no, no, that won't work.

32:31.520 --> 32:37.480
They were almost using my mind like a 3D CAD program that was animated.

32:37.480 --> 32:42.480
And I could test run in my head on these different conveyors.

32:42.480 --> 32:46.880
Men, is it time to stop mindless scrolling?

32:46.880 --> 32:50.480
Time to finally gain that higher quality of life you know you're missing out on?

32:50.480 --> 32:55.320
If this sounds familiar, then on January 9th, join thousands of men all over the world to

32:55.320 --> 32:59.520
embark on a 90 day journey together in search of a better life.

32:59.520 --> 33:03.440
It's called Exodus 90 and it was built to help men enjoy the freedom of becoming who

33:03.440 --> 33:05.440
they were truly made to be.

33:05.440 --> 33:10.360
Exodus 90 guides you in removing the attachments that are holding you back from a better life.

33:10.360 --> 33:12.680
And it actually works.

33:12.680 --> 33:17.000
Independent research shows that Exodus 90 men report considerable shifts after the first

33:17.000 --> 33:21.440
90 days, including stronger satisfaction rates in their marriages, more meaningful prayer

33:21.440 --> 33:25.680
lives, and dramatic decreases in time spent on their phones.

33:25.680 --> 33:30.360
For the past seven years, Exodus has helped more than 60,000 men build a roadmap for living

33:30.360 --> 33:35.320
with virtue in a culture that offers far too many paths to self-destruction.

33:35.320 --> 33:37.280
Is it time for your Exodus?

33:37.280 --> 33:39.200
We start January 9th.

33:39.200 --> 33:43.880
Find resources to prepare for Exodus at Exodus90.com slash Jordan.

33:43.880 --> 33:50.280
That's Exodus90.com slash Jordan.

33:50.280 --> 33:55.400
So let's go back to the issue of, say, taking sharp class out of school.

33:55.400 --> 34:00.040
So Baron Cohen talked about systematizers versus empathizers.

34:00.040 --> 34:05.280
Yeah, but what Baron Cohen did, he left out the object visualizers.

34:05.280 --> 34:10.160
He was looking more at the mathematical visualization pattern thinkers.

34:10.160 --> 34:17.960
I agree with him about systematizing and verbal, but the object visualizer.

34:17.960 --> 34:19.240
But he didn't differentiate.

34:19.240 --> 34:21.960
He didn't differentiate the systematizers properly.

34:21.960 --> 34:22.960
That should be more differentiated.

34:22.960 --> 34:23.960
Yeah, he didn't.

34:23.960 --> 34:29.080
The systematizers would have two categories, the object visualizer and the visual spatial.

34:29.080 --> 34:33.600
And a big mistake in a lot of perceptual studies is that they're not differentiating them.

34:33.600 --> 34:39.040
And some people, there's some verbal people in psychology that don't want to believe this

34:39.040 --> 34:40.040
stuff exists.

34:40.040 --> 34:46.480
Just while you were setting up the cameras, I downloaded six new abstracts that aren't

34:46.480 --> 34:51.760
even in my book on this that show that they are different.

34:51.760 --> 34:52.760
Right.

34:52.760 --> 34:55.640
Got them right here on my lap.

34:55.640 --> 35:00.760
So Cohen also talks about gender differences in relationship to this continuum.

35:00.760 --> 35:04.080
So we can break the continuum into two parts on the one end.

35:04.080 --> 35:11.160
And it is the case that autism tends to be preferentially a male disorder, although there

35:11.160 --> 35:12.800
are females as well.

35:12.800 --> 35:18.120
But so that systematizing mode of thinking that you've differentiated into the two categories

35:18.120 --> 35:22.800
also tends to be gender stereotype to some degree at a biological level.

35:22.800 --> 35:28.560
I avoid that issue as controversial because right now, I'm interested in one thing at

35:28.560 --> 35:33.960
the age of 75 of helping the students who think differently get into really good careers

35:33.960 --> 35:36.920
where they can have satisfying lives.

35:36.920 --> 35:39.360
And I avoid the controversial stuff.

35:39.800 --> 35:43.280
Yeah, well, I'm not so much interested in the controversy.

35:43.280 --> 35:49.160
I'm interested in trying to address the issue of why shop courses, for example, have been

35:49.160 --> 35:50.800
taken out of schools.

35:50.800 --> 35:57.120
Now we do know that schools are predominantly run by women, and women are more likely to

35:57.120 --> 35:58.120
be empathizing.

35:58.120 --> 36:00.480
No, I think it's a reason why they talk it out.

36:00.480 --> 36:04.400
So I'm wondering if there's a gender issue going on there and a prejudice against a certain

36:04.400 --> 36:05.400
way of thinking.

36:05.400 --> 36:06.400
Okay.

36:06.400 --> 36:07.400
What's that?

36:08.400 --> 36:12.440
One of the reasons they took out the shop classes, they kind of just go, everybody's

36:12.440 --> 36:16.640
going to go the university route and cost.

36:16.640 --> 36:19.160
Good shop classes cost a lot of money.

36:19.160 --> 36:23.440
Now people are starting to put shop classes back in, and you know what they're finding?

36:23.440 --> 36:26.360
They can't find anybody that teach the shop classes.

36:26.360 --> 36:30.760
I just heard about a brand new beautiful welding shop built here in Colorado at a community

36:30.760 --> 36:36.480
college and they can't find somebody to teach it even after they dropped the university requirement.

36:36.480 --> 36:40.480
And I can tell you right now, we need people that can do these things before the power

36:40.480 --> 36:42.360
grid and the water systems fall apart.

36:42.360 --> 36:44.720
I'll tell you that stuff I care about.

36:44.720 --> 36:45.720
Right.

36:45.720 --> 36:46.720
Right.

36:46.720 --> 36:47.720
Right.

36:47.720 --> 36:48.720
Yeah.

36:48.720 --> 36:53.680
Well, do you think virtualization has also played a role in this?

36:53.680 --> 36:55.200
I mean, the systematizing types.

36:55.200 --> 36:56.200
You can't.

36:56.200 --> 37:00.920
Some of the 3D drawings, I see a block.

37:00.920 --> 37:04.240
And that's not going to fix some of the serious problems we've got with infrastructure right

37:04.240 --> 37:05.440
now.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.040
And you need both kinds of thinkers.

37:07.040 --> 37:12.680
Like one of the things I've got in my book is where a bridge fell down in Minneapolis.

37:12.680 --> 37:14.480
And the workers were complaining.

37:14.480 --> 37:17.800
They were worried that when they were working on this bridge it was going to collapse.

37:17.800 --> 37:24.160
Well, I looked up that bridge collapse and I saw all the twisted metal and I took one

37:24.160 --> 37:26.880
look at that and I went, it's too light.

37:26.880 --> 37:29.200
It's too cheap.

37:29.200 --> 37:32.280
That was just from looking at the pictures.

37:32.280 --> 37:36.320
And I found the engineering report on why that bridge fell down.

37:36.320 --> 37:41.160
And they cheated on the gusset plates that hold the beams together and they were way

37:41.160 --> 37:43.720
thinner than the spec.

37:43.720 --> 37:49.320
But I had already looked at the pictures and said that bridge is too light, it's cheap

37:49.320 --> 37:54.080
before I read any engineering report.

37:54.080 --> 38:02.120
So how was it in your life that you attained the practical knowledge necessary to facilitate

38:02.120 --> 38:02.960
your thinking?

38:02.960 --> 38:06.480
So we're talking about how kids who take in the vision.

38:06.480 --> 38:07.480
I'll tell you how you do it.

38:07.480 --> 38:08.480
It's real simple.

38:08.480 --> 38:12.400
You got to get out and experience all kinds of stuff because the more information you

38:12.400 --> 38:14.760
put in the database, the better you get.

38:14.760 --> 38:19.160
And going back to teaching a computer how to diagnose melanoma, you had to give it like

38:19.160 --> 38:24.160
a couple of thousand melanoma examples and a couple of thousand mosquito bites, infected

38:24.160 --> 38:26.800
boils and everything else, examples.

38:26.800 --> 38:32.480
In other words, the more, as I got older and I got more and more information in my database,

38:32.480 --> 38:38.400
I could think better and better and better and I could make smaller categories of things.

38:38.400 --> 38:42.240
Now a lot of the people that I worked with in construction that build equipment for me,

38:42.240 --> 38:47.480
that's used in every large beef plant now in the US, some of them started and some of

38:47.480 --> 38:49.920
them would definitely be autistic.

38:49.920 --> 38:55.120
One of them started out working on cars, another one took a single welding class and now he's

38:55.120 --> 39:00.800
selling mechanical equipment all over the world, started with a tiny shop that then

39:00.800 --> 39:02.440
grew into a big shop.

39:02.440 --> 39:10.640
And what's happening now is the little shops are not forming and that's why we're importing

39:10.640 --> 39:15.400
all this equipment from Holland and Italy because when you look at their educational

39:15.400 --> 39:21.920
system and I looked it up again recently online, Italy actually has three routes, university

39:21.920 --> 39:28.040
route, tech route, mechanical and art route, you know like for their fashion industry and

39:28.040 --> 39:32.960
the Holland and Netherlands you can go either university route or tech route and that's

39:32.960 --> 39:37.680
why they're making the state-of-the-art chip making machine that we don't make.

39:37.680 --> 39:38.680
Right.

39:38.680 --> 39:43.360
And I'm not talking potato chips, I'm talking electronic chips.

39:43.360 --> 39:44.520
Right.

39:44.520 --> 39:50.480
I wonder if this is also a consequence of people increasingly moving away from farms.

39:50.480 --> 39:54.280
No, because when you're on a farm you'd have to do a lot of hands-on stuff, you have to

39:54.280 --> 39:58.360
do a lot of fence repair, you've got to take care of your own machinery and as you move

39:58.360 --> 40:02.840
into the urban environment everything in some sense even in the real world is virtualized

40:02.840 --> 40:06.480
because you can always call on other people to do the day-to-day things that you need

40:06.480 --> 40:09.000
to keep the infrastructure in place for example.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Well, I agree.

40:10.000 --> 40:15.680
A lot of kids are growing up today totally removed from the practical.

40:15.680 --> 40:23.160
And one of the things I talk about in the visual thinking book is I talked to a doctor

40:23.160 --> 40:28.680
and he told me he had trouble training interns to sew up cuts because the interns had never

40:28.680 --> 40:31.560
used scissors as a young child.

40:31.560 --> 40:36.760
I had a student in my class that had never used a tape measure to measure anything.

40:36.760 --> 40:41.120
And they're totally removed from the world of the practical where those kids that came

40:41.120 --> 40:46.520
off the farms, yes, they had to figure out how to fix things, absolutely.

40:46.520 --> 40:51.120
But I think what's happening now in the schools is things are getting so verbal and they're

40:51.120 --> 40:57.400
going absolutely crazy on math requirements because I know people with 20 patents and

40:57.400 --> 41:02.960
they could basically do sixth grade arithmetic that I could do because I can relate that

41:02.960 --> 41:05.720
back to real things and things like.

41:05.720 --> 41:15.440
Do you know of any research pertaining on how the people who visualize objects might

41:15.440 --> 41:17.400
be assessed for their ability?

41:17.400 --> 41:18.400
Yes.

41:18.400 --> 41:22.080
And there's a whole chapter in here.

41:22.080 --> 41:27.560
There's a whole chapter in here and I never can pronounce their names, Blank and Culver

41:27.560 --> 41:30.480
and I never can say the names correctly.

41:30.480 --> 41:35.700
But I have a whole list of references in there where the difference between the object visual

41:35.700 --> 41:39.660
analyzer and the visual spatial is being assessed.

41:39.660 --> 41:41.500
And there's a whole bunch of references on that.

41:41.500 --> 41:49.340
Now I have to look these names up because I can't pronounce them correctly.

41:49.340 --> 41:56.300
Let me find the reference list here for chapter two, okay, it's Blazhenkova.

41:56.300 --> 42:03.220
I've got one, two, three references in here from Blazhenkova on types of creativity and

42:03.220 --> 42:15.700
then the other big reference, I have lots of references, would be Kozhevnikov if she's

42:15.700 --> 42:22.900
got trade-offs, object versus spatial visualization, reviewing the visual verbal dimension, evidence

42:22.900 --> 42:29.300
for two types of visualizers, that's another paper, spatial versus object visualization,

42:29.300 --> 42:32.620
a new characterization of visual cognitive style.

42:32.820 --> 42:39.340
There's three papers right there from Kozhevnikov that are in my reference list and I've got

42:39.340 --> 42:45.580
a lot of references where their actual tests were done.

42:45.580 --> 42:50.340
When I go through the citation lists, I just went in and we're working on the children's

42:50.340 --> 42:56.460
edition of the book right now and one of the copy editors had a query about a reference

42:56.500 --> 43:03.260
and I had to look that up and then I decided to just type in object visualizer, visual

43:03.260 --> 43:10.100
spatial into Google Scholar again and find the same old papers and then I found some

43:10.100 --> 43:15.580
citations, it's kind of a cool paper here in the journal Cognition, it's an old paper

43:15.580 --> 43:19.900
actually, visual objectability, a new dimension of nonverbal intelligence.

43:19.900 --> 43:25.380
I know from working in factories, I spent 25 years in heavy construction and that is

43:25.420 --> 43:30.820
something that I don't think many teachers have done that and seen how these guys think.

43:30.820 --> 43:38.980
Big complicated Cargill plans, IBP plans which are now Tyson, Monfort plans, that company

43:38.980 --> 43:44.900
is now JBS, figuring out complicated things with equipment.

43:44.900 --> 43:51.740
It's a different type of intelligence and I think when I worked on the book with Betsy

43:51.740 --> 43:58.660
Lerner, my super verbal co-writer who helped me organize things and she had someone come

43:58.660 --> 44:03.860
in to fix a bunch of stuff in her house and after we had discussed this, Betsy was telling

44:03.860 --> 44:08.900
me, well I watched how he figured out how to fix the stones on the chimney.

44:08.900 --> 44:13.780
I had never really thought about it before but she watched how he did things and then

44:13.780 --> 44:18.540
she started to understand there's a form of intelligence there that's absolutely not

44:18.660 --> 44:19.660
verbal.

44:19.660 --> 44:23.300
When she watched a person, she hired to fix stuff in her house.

44:23.300 --> 44:24.780
Right, right.

44:24.780 --> 44:30.180
Yeah, well you can imagine something and this did pop into my mind visually, can imagine

44:30.180 --> 44:35.700
somebody who's trying to put together a stone chimney has to rotate stones to make sure

44:35.700 --> 44:39.020
that they're going, like a Tetris game, that's a good way of thinking about it.

44:39.020 --> 44:43.340
I was thinking then again, because I'm thinking in images now that we're talking, I was thinking

44:43.340 --> 44:49.340
about my young grandson, he was only two years old, he had his Legos laid out in front

44:49.340 --> 44:53.780
of him and when I was a kid, I played a lot with Legos and I played a fair bit with this

44:53.780 --> 44:59.620
mechano set that was like a junior engineering set and it was certainly the case that working

44:59.620 --> 45:06.260
with Legos was non-verbal because you're rotating shapes in space and having them fit into one

45:06.260 --> 45:14.820
another towards some design end and that's a nice kind of hands-on learning and exposure

45:14.820 --> 45:20.580
to different mechanical principles and so do you have recommendations for people who

45:20.580 --> 45:29.340
want to help their children train their visual spatial and object visualization abilities?

45:29.340 --> 45:31.020
Let's get them out building things.

45:31.020 --> 45:34.580
The big mistake I see with a lot of kids is they're super good with Legos, they don't

45:34.580 --> 45:36.260
think to introduce tools.

45:36.260 --> 45:40.860
I was using tools by second grade, I was not using a saw, but I was using hammer, screwdriver

45:40.860 --> 45:46.180
and pliers, I was taught how to use them safely, I've got another book of children's projects

45:46.180 --> 45:51.780
called Calling All Minds where I describe bird kites that I spent hours with tinkering

45:51.780 --> 46:01.700
to get them to work, to agree with parachutes to get them to open up more easily, kids today

46:01.980 --> 46:06.820
are totally separated in the world of physical things.

46:06.820 --> 46:13.660
They're not getting out and observing stuff out in nature, this is part of the problem

46:13.660 --> 46:20.740
and I just went to a veterinary school where the students are so far removed from practical

46:20.740 --> 46:26.020
things that to give them dexterity skills and surgical skills they have these plastic

46:26.020 --> 46:30.340
tote boxes and they put children's puzzles inside them and they've got to just reach

46:30.460 --> 46:36.060
in and by feel put these children's puzzles together because when they were in kindergarten

46:36.060 --> 46:37.700
they never did this.

46:37.700 --> 46:39.500
Right, right, right.

46:39.500 --> 46:44.460
Yeah, well my parents told me that when I was four my favorite toy was a screwdriver

46:44.460 --> 46:49.180
and that I used to take all the cupboard doors off the cupboards in the kitchens.

46:49.180 --> 46:53.980
And so I was introduced to tools at a very early age and that there's a real practical

46:53.980 --> 46:59.100
utility in that too because now if I visualize a project in my house shelving or something

46:59.100 --> 47:05.380
like that or any construction project of any sort, well I can visualize the array of tools

47:05.380 --> 47:11.460
that's necessary to make that come about and then I have the tools at hand and I know how

47:11.460 --> 47:20.460
to use them and that is a, well, it's also, I really find that kind of work calming and

47:20.460 --> 47:21.620
engrossing.

47:24.620 --> 47:26.660
We'll be back in one moment.

47:26.660 --> 47:31.140
Next we wanted to give you a sneak peek at Jordan's new documentary, Logos in Literacy.

47:35.140 --> 47:41.540
I was very much struck by how the translation of the Biblical writings jump-started the

47:41.540 --> 47:44.740
development of literacy across the entire world.

47:44.740 --> 47:46.740
Illiteracy was the norm.

47:46.740 --> 47:52.460
The pastor's home was the first school and every morning it would begin with singing.

47:52.460 --> 47:55.660
The Christian faith is a singing religion.

47:55.660 --> 48:00.580
Probably 80% of scripture memorization today exists only because of what is sung.

48:00.580 --> 48:01.580
This is amazing.

48:01.580 --> 48:08.140
Here we have a Gutenberg Bible printed on the press of Johann Gutenberg.

48:08.140 --> 48:14.140
Science and religion are opposing forces in the world but historically that has not been

48:14.140 --> 48:15.140
the case.

48:15.140 --> 48:17.380
Now the book is available to everyone.

48:17.380 --> 48:26.180
From Shakespeare to modern education and medicine and science to civilization itself.

48:26.180 --> 48:31.900
It is the most influential book in all of history and hopefully people can walk away

48:31.900 --> 48:33.780
with at least a sense of that.

48:38.300 --> 48:42.340
Well the problem is is we got kids growing up today totally removed from the world of

48:42.340 --> 48:43.540
the practical.

48:43.540 --> 48:45.420
They don't use tools.

48:45.420 --> 48:47.660
They don't use scissors.

48:47.660 --> 48:51.660
I had a student in a class who had never used a ruler or tape measure to measure anything

48:51.660 --> 48:54.220
ever.

48:54.220 --> 49:01.300
I think that's a problem because if you haven't done practical things then you don't understand

49:01.300 --> 49:02.300
how to fix things.

49:02.300 --> 49:05.620
Okay like two years ago they had the horrible mess where the power you know like a bunch

49:05.620 --> 49:08.540
of different power stations froze.

49:08.540 --> 49:13.900
Well I never heard so much abstract gobbledygook about that because the way I would work on

49:13.900 --> 49:18.540
fixing it would be all right let's look at each power station what piece of equipment

49:18.540 --> 49:20.940
actually froze.

49:20.940 --> 49:24.820
I never saw anything written in the press that described okay what froze in this plant.

49:24.820 --> 49:30.780
What froze in this plant because my inclination would be to kind of rank them on okay a turbine

49:30.780 --> 49:34.780
haul that froze I can build a building over it that's an easy one you know a whole bunch

49:34.780 --> 49:41.900
of gas wells froze that's gonna be like really difficult to fix but you see nothing's abstract

49:41.900 --> 49:46.740
because okay if I'm gonna try to figure out how to fix it I don't really want to argue

49:46.740 --> 49:52.060
who owns them I'm not interested in the politics I would just rank the power stations on expansiveness

49:52.060 --> 49:58.060
and difficulty to winterize and say exactly what piece of equipment froze and you know

49:58.060 --> 50:02.660
how I can find out you let me loosen there away from the managers I'll find the maintenance

50:02.660 --> 50:04.540
shop they'll show me everything.

50:04.540 --> 50:09.300
And I know enough about equipment that they can't BS me.

50:09.300 --> 50:15.660
Right so maybe part of the advantage to that more visual form of processing is also its

50:15.660 --> 50:22.660
association with that kind of practical particularization that's right that's right now on the other

50:22.660 --> 50:27.460
hand I have no idea how to balance a power grid that's a job for the mathematicians you

50:27.460 --> 50:34.940
see this is where we need to work together and in a complementary factor in a complementary

50:34.940 --> 50:39.380
way and I tell people in big corporations that I've done a lot of talks for businesses

50:39.380 --> 50:48.540
your first step is that you've got to recognize different kinds of thinking exists and let's

50:48.540 --> 50:53.500
take another example recently I visited two really nice dairies up in Quebec Canada that

50:53.500 --> 50:58.300
have the robotic milking machines where the cow can go in she decides one she wants to

50:58.300 --> 51:04.540
get milk and get fed and on both dairies it actually made some good mechanical modifications

51:04.540 --> 51:10.300
on that equipment which the equipment company finally adopted but one of the dairy producers

51:10.300 --> 51:16.380
said to me I stop at the computer stuff I don't mess with the program that's somebody else's

51:16.380 --> 51:22.100
job to work on the software but the mechanical parts of the device they figured out ways

51:22.100 --> 51:29.220
to improve it yeah it's like a it's like a hierarchy man you can imagine a hierarchy

51:29.220 --> 51:35.460
of generalization with the highest resolution lowest level being the particulars of a given

51:35.460 --> 51:42.580
machine then you can imagine people but specialized to operate at different levels of the hierarchy

51:42.580 --> 51:47.500
maybe the verbal types are operating at the high well that's right they are but they lose

51:47.500 --> 51:51.660
that particularization that's right that's basically right because the verbalizer tends

51:51.700 --> 51:56.620
to overgeneralize one of the papers that are reviewed in my book on visual thinking was

51:56.620 --> 52:03.220
an interesting study where on high school students that came life for school specializing

52:03.220 --> 52:07.900
in the arts another school specializing in the sciences and another one especially in

52:07.900 --> 52:13.380
the humanities which would be more verbal on those teams of students and their assignment

52:13.380 --> 52:20.380
was to create a new planet so the art students heavily visualizing they made a planet with

52:20.780 --> 52:26.220
crystals on it another one made a skyscraper planet and then the more mathematical science

52:26.220 --> 52:33.420
students just painted a round made a round ball and described the gravity and the atmosphere

52:33.420 --> 52:38.060
you know kind of boring pictures and the verbal thinkers started write it down and then they

52:38.060 --> 52:43.420
go oh wait a minute we're supposed to draw the planet so they made kind of splotchy stuff on it

52:43.420 --> 52:49.900
but the thing that was interesting is that the art minds more my kind of mind and the mathematical

52:49.900 --> 52:57.020
minds they had big planning sessions on how to design their planet where the verbal thinkers

52:57.020 --> 53:01.580
on they didn't do any planning you see this is the problem the verbal thinker would get big

53:01.580 --> 53:08.620
broad concepts or something we need to do right but how do you actually implement those concepts

53:08.620 --> 53:14.700
yeah right there's no detail there now in food safety we have a thing that I really like it's

53:14.700 --> 53:21.100
called hazard analysis critical control points so let's say I'm out there in a sea of of things

53:21.100 --> 53:27.180
I can do well I can't do all that stuff you see now the critical control point let's say in food

53:27.180 --> 53:35.180
safety in a food factory I can't measure microbes and bacteria on everything in that plant I have

53:35.180 --> 53:42.300
to pick out the places where I'm most likely to have contamination that would be the critical

53:42.300 --> 53:49.900
control points and one of them is doorknobs yeah that's why some places food factories have

53:49.900 --> 53:57.260
automatic doors because that gets rid of touching the door yeah well one of one of the things that

53:57.260 --> 54:04.700
I always found a relief in working with engineers is that they were good and I can see it in the

54:04.700 --> 54:10.860
terms that you're describing they were very good at rank ordering practical priorities right and

54:10.860 --> 54:17.580
that that seems to be part of this particularization so I have this company it's a software company

54:17.580 --> 54:24.700
that sells personality tests and and writing programs for people to help them plan their lives

54:24.700 --> 54:30.460
and my business partners and engineer and although he's also very intelligent verbally he's more

54:30.460 --> 54:38.060
intelligent non-verbally and he knows the systems right from the from the code upward at every level

54:38.060 --> 54:43.580
of the machine instantiation and so the huge advantage to that is that if anything ever goes

54:43.580 --> 54:48.940
wrong he knows exactly what goes wrong and he knows exactly how to fix it it's particularized

54:48.940 --> 54:54.620
down to the point where that makes action possible eh and that's part of the problem with the with

54:54.620 --> 54:59.900
the verbal abstraction is that it makes sense conceptually but that doesn't mean that it's

54:59.900 --> 55:04.540
detailed to the point where it's actually implementable and then it it's like a pseudo knowledge

55:04.540 --> 55:11.020
right because it sounds like you've got the picture right but when you actually try to

55:11.020 --> 55:16.140
implement it you find out that that that it's really a hollow a hollow shell of conceptualization

55:16.140 --> 55:21.740
well I kind of look at like this is why when I learned about the food safety concept of

55:21.740 --> 55:26.300
hazard analysis critical control points or let's just call it critical control points

55:26.300 --> 55:33.260
so I've got a big sea of stuff out there what's the really important thing okay now I I only think

55:33.260 --> 55:39.980
in specific examples so let's take frozen Texas power stations the critical control

55:39.980 --> 55:47.740
point is and I want it like in two sentences what great piece of equipment froze and then

55:47.740 --> 55:53.420
you can very easily figure out the ones that'll be easy to winterize and I've actually talked to

55:53.420 --> 55:59.820
somebody who installs gas wells and I only cost $5,000 to winterize a well when you build it

55:59.820 --> 56:05.500
to retrofits a complete mess he also said you have to have someone who knows how to turn the

56:05.500 --> 56:12.540
valves he said that's me right I call him the guy in the pickup and that person in that pickup

56:12.540 --> 56:19.180
truck is not getting enough credit he knows how to turn those valves right yeah so if you

56:19.180 --> 56:25.100
conceptualize that verbally you end up saying something like a bad winter storm took out the

56:25.100 --> 56:31.340
Texas power grid and that sort of sounds like you've said something but it's nothing like saying

56:31.340 --> 56:38.220
well the grid is made out of 200 different uh like industrial assemblies each of those

56:38.220 --> 56:43.020
is made up of a variety of parts that's differentially susceptible to winter all right well that's

56:43.020 --> 56:49.020
still gobbledygook because first of all they wouldn't have 200 separate power stations you know it's

56:49.020 --> 56:58.380
more like 10 something like that and and I would just let I listen well write down the name of the

56:58.380 --> 57:02.780
station because I don't really care who owns it and what we used to do with meat packing plants when

57:02.780 --> 57:08.060
we were doing welfare audits is we'd always call them by their town names because you're auditing

57:08.060 --> 57:13.740
that particular plant next I will this power station at a frozen turbine hall that's an easy one to

57:13.740 --> 57:20.220
fix on then there was a coal fire that froze well as they freeze up the where you have a cold

57:20.220 --> 57:28.940
bump sand that's probably really easy to fix and if you know 50 gas wells froze up the feet of plant

57:28.940 --> 57:36.060
that's going to be a mess to fix on but you see as I talk about these things I see it and I happen

57:36.060 --> 57:41.100
to know what some of the equipment looks like you see that also makes me a better troubleshooter

57:41.100 --> 57:46.780
you know if I know what stuff looks like you see this is where you've got to put things in my database

57:48.220 --> 57:54.380
but I but I worked 25 years out in factories on heavy construction stuff so I know what a lot

57:54.380 --> 58:00.700
of stuff looks like right so so it means in some sense that to solve the problem is you take the

58:00.700 --> 58:07.260
verbal representation so the verbal representation is a storm took out the texas power grid and then

58:07.260 --> 58:12.860
you say well there's 10 key components to that's okay our grid so that differentiates that and then

58:12.860 --> 58:21.020
you say in each of the 10 systems there are critically vulnerable points that are specifically

58:21.020 --> 58:25.820
sensitive to cold weather we need to differentiate and find out what those key ones are then we

58:25.820 --> 58:30.620
have to differentiate that further you see now okay now when I first started my work there was no

58:30.620 --> 58:36.060
Google Earth well the first thing I do probably Google Earth and Street View the power stations

58:37.340 --> 58:42.540
and the other thing I've learned if I want to get accurate information I don't you don't talk to the

58:42.540 --> 58:49.020
managers you got to get down in the shop and and then the shop guys have to be not worried about

58:49.020 --> 58:54.300
getting fired that's another right right nasty issue that I'm going to have to deal with

58:55.740 --> 59:00.780
but you know let's say I get three shop guys together and we have okay my industry say when

59:00.780 --> 59:05.100
we get rid of all the suits you know that's going to be the managers and the verbal thinkers

59:05.100 --> 59:08.860
they won't talk in front of suits they're afraid they're going to lose their jobs

59:09.740 --> 59:13.980
you know and this is something I know from all the years I've worked in this stuff

59:13.980 --> 59:19.420
and then they'll take you out there and show you what froze and then oh there's creative things I've

59:19.420 --> 59:24.860
talked to a guy I worked in a power plant and there was this one sensor very important electronic

59:24.860 --> 59:32.060
sensor and it gets cold and when it got cold he put plastic garbage bags over it and I'm going

59:32.060 --> 59:37.260
right well I think we need to have something a little more permanent to keep that sensor warm

59:37.260 --> 59:45.500
than black plastic garbage bags that's what I told him yeah so so that that issue that the the guys

59:45.500 --> 59:51.180
with the hands-on knowledge have to worry about being fired is interesting too because it seems

59:51.180 --> 59:57.500
like so they have this extremely detailed knowledge that's practical about how these systems operate

59:57.500 --> 01:00:03.020
and what happens is if they bring that knowledge up the abstraction hierarchy what they're doing

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:08.460
in some sense is is pointing out the manner in which their superiors their hypothetical

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:17.580
well that's the problem and a very big problem I've had is um I they're they're worried about

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:25.660
losing their jobs yeah and and but you really want to solve the problem they need to be able to

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:30.780
talk to you freely because they're the ones that tell you exactly what froze

01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:39.100
right well the question is why would their attempts to bring their practical reality to bear

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:45.180
as they move information up the information hierarchy why would that threaten people to the

01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:52.380
point where they would be intimidated in relationship to their job I mean why is there this gap the

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:57.100
psychological gap between the practical and the abstract I mean you'd think that the managers

01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:02.380
would be calling on these people all the time you got to drag those suits out of the office too

01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:10.140
just when things are working normally and so they get a better understanding of what the

01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:16.220
practical people are doing now my animal welfare work on one of the things where I made some of

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:20.780
the biggest difference in animal welfare work is auditing programs I helped develop with McDonald's

01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:28.620
Wendy's and Burger King back over 20 years ago and in this situation we were taking vice president

01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:35.420
level managers out to the plant and they'd have these undercover boss moments just like that show

01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:41.020
I'll never forget the day when the McDonald's vice president saw a half-dead dairy cow go into

01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:47.980
their product and he goes yeah we got some things here we have to fix you see before it was all an

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:54.060
abstraction spreadsheets numbers okay animal welfare give it to lawyers give it to the public

01:01:54.060 --> 01:02:00.540
relations department but when they came out of the office and they saw something bad now it was real

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:07.340
now they had to act it was no longer abstract anymore there seems to be a kind of pride in that

01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:12.540
abstraction in some sense I mean I've also noticed that highly intellectual people and maybe those

01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:18.060
are ones who think primarily in words tend to be rather dismissive of the intelligence of more

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:24.300
practical people like working people and that's I come from a working class environment so although

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:29.420
I've hung around verbal people most of my life so I can see that dichotomy do you have any sense of

01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:38.860
why it is that the more abstract thinkers are have a well because they used to say okay the kids

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:43.900
that are like failing in high school stupid kids go and shop well I can tell you right now

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:49.420
right exactly I worked big metal fabrication companies owned by these so-called stupid people

01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:53.340
and what they they were inventing equipment they had 20 patents and they were very proud of their

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:59.820
patents and one of them made posters out of them put them up all over his place it's a different

01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:08.460
kind of intelligence and and it's not you know there's things they can do that the verbal thinkers

01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:13.820
can't do and what I what I'm really interested in is we need all the different kinds of minds

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:19.900
because one of the problems with my kind of thinker since I'm associative is the point in a company

01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:24.940
let's say I had a metal fabrication shop I'd have to hire a verbal thinker just to run the business

01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:31.260
the payroll ordering materials things all of that part of it do you think it's a competition

01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:36.780
do you think it's a competition for status between different forms of neurodiversity

01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:42.860
I mean if I can claim that my intelligence is paramount that that increases my social status

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:47.980
in some sense right you can imagine there's a competition for that broadly going on in society

01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:54.940
what I have found is when you got the verbal thinkers out in the field their eyes got opened

01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:03.180
that the important thing is you got to drag the suits out of the office I've done a whole lot of

01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:09.420
that and let me tell you they changed okay I've done a lot of work on supply chain management

01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:15.180
and when there's supply chain disasters like a factory burning up and a clothing industry

01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:21.100
disgusting industry they need to clean up a lot of stuff and a factory burns up a hundred people

01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:29.500
selling bluejanes well the suits didn't get out of the office and see what was going on in these

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:35.500
factories until there was a disaster the one they should have been preventing a disaster like that

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:41.740
right well yeah so once you build up hierarchical organizations it's very easy for the people who

01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:47.500
are operating near the top of the abstraction chain not to pay attention to the details and

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:51.340
hopefully the details are working out so well that you don't have to pay attention to them I mean

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:56.220
that's in some sense the point of building a hierarchical organization but but what you need to

01:04:56.220 --> 01:05:02.380
do obviously the manager can't be you know doing every job out there in a plant but they need to

01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:08.540
have enough contact with the field and I'm going to use the field be like the factory floor farming

01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:16.380
you know waterworks any of these kind of things so they they understand the difference

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:21.340
there can be things bad going on but I tell business managers and I've talked to many big

01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:29.100
corporations computer companies steel companies on pharmaceutical companies that the first step is

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:36.060
realizing that different kinds of thinking exist and that they can work together in complementary

01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:43.260
ways and you actually need the whole team you need the whole team because we're kind of

01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:48.700
disorganized and associational and I'm going to need a verbal thinker if I got a really big

01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:57.500
business to you know keep the business going so what do you think what do you think of the

01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:05.180
suppositions and you talk about them a bit in your book that the visual versus verbal modes of

01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:10.540
cognition map to some degree on to hemispheric specialization well that the right is more

01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:15.340
oriented towards your kind the right hemisphere is more oriented broadly speaking towards

01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:21.020
speaking broadly so it dominates your mind yeah but broadly speaking that's true you know

01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:26.700
they're accept they're exceptions to some of that that stuff but I'm the thing that I want to talk

01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:35.180
about is is right now I'm seeing too many kids that are dyslexic autistic or whatever I'm

01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:42.380
ending up playing video games on a disability check when they could be photographers I got

01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:49.900
four person crew here right now doing this filming and that's an interesting career

01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:56.060
or they could be designing mechanical equipment and they never get an opportunity to do photography

01:06:56.060 --> 01:07:01.020
art or mechanical equipment because it kind of looked at these stupid kids

01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:08.300
right right okay so there's a privileging of this semantic and that's partly because it's

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:14.220
cheaper it's easier it's detached from the world in some sense how do you think we should redesign

01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:19.820
schools for say kindergarten kids and elementary kids in some practical way you tend to think

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:26.060
practically what do you what do you think would be a good start well like in the 50s when I went

01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:31.180
to school we had all kinds of craft projects I was learning to use little blunt scissors probably

01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:36.060
in first grade I'd be putting all the hands-on classes back into schools and that's going to

01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:44.780
include theater music cooking sewing when I went to elementary school I loved art sewing and wood

01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:50.540
working and if I hadn't had those classes I would have hated elementary school and I loved sewing

01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:55.900
and I'm what I was in fourth grade I had a singer sew handy a toy sewing machine that

01:07:55.900 --> 01:08:00.380
actually sewed and it was one of my favorite things because I could make things with it

01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:08.460
kids are not doing enough of that kind of stuff today right okay so there's a return to the there's

01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:13.340
there's a need for a return to the practical on in some sense on both sides of the gender

01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:20.460
everybody on every way with and I would now I went when I was doing a book signing for visual

01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:28.460
thinking I went to on a physics lab in Harvard this room's labeled physics lab and they had all

01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:33.260
kinds of 3d printers on there but they also had a sewing machine and they also had a station for

01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:39.820
crocheting this is the building labeled engineering department at Harvard maybe they're realizing

01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:43.660
they've got to get them doing some hands-on things this is when I did the book signing

01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:49.180
for this it was part of the book tour the other thing I've noticed I stayed I got into some

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:57.180
interesting places I stayed at this hotel where where they is in Evansville Illinois where they had

01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:04.780
textbooks in the rooms from the 1930s I wish I'd had more time to look at it and I pulled out an

01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:12.380
electrical engineering book and it had a lot of math in it but it was much more applied they'd

01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:16.700
say well this is how this is the generator works this is the math that goes well but it would

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:25.820
describe how the generator actually worked it was much more applied and I now the physiology book

01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:31.260
that I had in the 70s you know explain how the kidney works how the heart works and then explain

01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:35.740
the chemistry now I look at a physiology book and it's much more verbal a lot more math and

01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:41.820
chemistry but how does the kidney actually work I still have my old Duke's physiology of domestic

01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:48.460
animals from 1970 and I want to go back and compare that to the Duke's physiology now and

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:57.260
and it's like we're taking the practical out I just got an email yesterday from the UK that they

01:09:57.260 --> 01:10:02.460
wanted to take a technology and design course out of a high school you see I think this what's

01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:08.140
happening now is mathematics is totally taking over yes we need mathematics because my kind of

01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:13.820
mind is not going to touch boilers and refrigeration in that food processing plant that's a job for

01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:21.500
the mathematicians but what we're losing is the object visualizer right right right yeah well I

01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:28.300
wonder I wonder too if part of this is the fact that you know for a long time in our society

01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:34.060
a lot of this practical machinery just worked and so we could afford to ignore it in some

01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:40.060
abstract sense right because our cars worked and our power grids worked and we could take all of

01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:44.460
this low-level infrastructure for granted now that meant there were a lot of people on the shop

01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:49.980
floors who were busily working making sure it worked but it did mean that we had the luxury to

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:55.820
engage in abstract specialization and maybe we could fall prey to the psychological tendency

01:10:55.820 --> 01:11:02.540
to just dismiss all that well you see when they first started about 20 years ago is when they

01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:08.460
started taking shop classes out of the schools well you can get away with that for a while

01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:16.700
and then the people I worked with on gray now are retiring they're retiring out and they're not

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:22.140
getting replaced that's happening with elevator and escalator mechanics that's happening with airplane

01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:28.140
mechanics and I'm seeing that more and more and more and more as I travel these are free things

01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:37.420
that I see all the time and they are getting gray right right so yeah the retirement problem's going

01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:43.500
to be the retirement although there's when it comes to industry there's two gigantic mistakes

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:51.100
that were made shutting down in-house engineering shops 20 years ago we had a huge metalworking

01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:56.860
shop called the Montfort fab shop and it was part of the engineering of a company called Montfort so

01:11:56.860 --> 01:12:03.580
no longer exists now well that's been shut down and then at the same time we took out shop classes

01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:09.820
now in the short run it was cheaper for these companies to just farm out engineering work they

01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:17.100
need to do in their plant yeah that works fine until the shops retire out and now what's happened

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:20.860
like I can't go in the name give you the name of the company but I have a client right now

01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:28.140
where the one shop that's left is ripping people off at five times the price and that's happening

01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:37.340
right right do you see any positive consequences of computer technology for object visualizers

01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:42.300
and for the for the people who are working more in the visual spatial end of things well it's

01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:48.860
definitely useful to you know like the visualization and stuff you can do on computers but that doesn't

01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:56.620
replace real things let me tell you power grid I lay awake at night about that and that's so fragile

01:12:56.620 --> 01:13:01.660
that I'm not I'm not going to go into any detail because it's too fragile and I'm not going to

01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:07.740
discuss the things that I visualize and lay awake at night about the power grid because it's just

01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:15.900
okay um okay I'm curious about that why not discuss them because I don't want to give I don't want to

01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:21.740
give people that have bad intentions any information on how to hurt the power grid okay okay okay I see

01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:28.620
I see that is the reason right because it's very easy so when you and I don't want to give out any

01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:33.580
information that would help somebody damage the power grid so I don't discuss the details here

01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:40.860
but I'm seeing them right now right right right yeah well that's part of that ability to think about

01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:45.660
critical points of failure well there's I know exactly I'm engineering mind I know where the

01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:52.620
critical points of failure are and I'm not going to discuss them right right so we can all be thankful

01:13:52.620 --> 01:14:00.220
that you're not a terrorist yeah I'll be thankful I'm not a criminal yes exactly exactly yeah well

01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:07.580
I've always often been afraid when thinking along the same lines that you're describing of just exactly

01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:12.540
how fragile things are in that regard and how much someone with a good imagination how much

01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:17.900
damage they could do if they targeted things properly it is really quite frightening to apprehend

01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:23.180
well that's why there's certain things about the power grid I am not going to discuss and I'm seeing

01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:29.820
three big fat critical control points right now I'm seeing them in my mind and they make me cringe

01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:36.940
right so so could we talk a little bit about the specifics of your work I remember one of the

01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:42.860
stories you told at this Tucson conference was about you talked about cows that they would do

01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:47.580
such things as go into a field and look at if you look left a briefcase on the field for example

01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:53.260
the cows would eventually come and look at it yeah that's right a cow's in a in a line might be

01:14:53.260 --> 01:15:00.780
stopped by something like a coke bottle in their path and so you used your ability to think like

01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:07.340
animals to design systems for animal handling that were much more humane so could you walk us

01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:14.060
through that a little bit well the first work I did with cattle was in the 70s in Arizona I

01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:18.780
when I didn't even know that I had was a visual thinker and other people were not a visual thinker

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:23.340
and I noticed that if there was a coat hung on the fence the cattle would stop

01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:30.300
on if there was a shadow or reflection off a vehicle so I got down in the shoots to see what

01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:36.620
they were seeing and I would take pictures down inside the shoot and people thought that was kind

01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:44.620
of crazy but now I'm like right just recently did start up at a really big plant and at 10 o'clock

01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:49.740
in the morning everything was working fine and then at three o'clock in the afternoon a big shadow

01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:55.420
appeared I called the spider monster and it was just a shadow and these cattle decided they weren't

01:15:55.420 --> 01:16:01.180
going to walk over that so they'll have to build a roof over the facility so that the cattle can't

01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:07.340
see the spider monster on the other thing I'm I show I show people how to do is watch your lead

01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:12.780
animal your lead animal will come up and stop and look at the thing they don't like the same plant

01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:19.020
on the night shift okay the shadow monster wouldn't be there they either the guy calls me and he goes

01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:24.940
they go halfway up the shoot and stop all right what do I do I said now bring up a nice calm bunch

01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:30.460
of cattle watch your leader really carefully he'll look right at the thing he doesn't like

01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:37.580
and there's an LED light on the corner of a building and they took that down and then everything

01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:45.260
worked fine how do you identify the leader well there's always a leader when when all right let's

01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:52.060
say I take a 20 head of cattle out of a pan there's a lead animal that walks out first usually one

01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:57.580
of the more bold animals not the dominant animal the dominant animal that pushes the others away

01:16:57.580 --> 01:17:02.060
from the feed trough he's in the middle of the herd or she's in the middle of the herd but the

01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:07.260
leader will come out of the pen first and the other cattle follow and it's just the first animal in

01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:11.500
the group it's a leader it's that simple you see as we're talking about that I'm seeing it

01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:19.820
okay so so is that leader stable across instances of leadership and is that associated with this

01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:26.620
ability to find what's anomalous and to deal with well in cattle that have lived together for a while

01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:33.500
tend to stay in the same order you know years ago when your tags came out that were sequentially

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:37.900
numbered in other words you could just buy a package of ear tags labeled one through 200

01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:44.220
and they put them on their cattle and one of the things that surprised ranchers when maybe 200

01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:49.420
cattle came back the following year to go through the shoots to get vaccinated and they were coming

01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:58.780
to in almost the same order now that's a group of cattle that live together okay is there something

01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:03.740
okay so you made the observation that the lead animal will stop and look at the thing that he

01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:10.300
doesn't like and so are the other animals and but it also that lead animal wasn't the physically

01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:15.260
dominant animal he's got some other characteristics the animal it's dominant at the pushing others

01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:20.780
away from the water trough or the feed trough but the but once the lead animal walks the other

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:25.740
cattle usually will follow same thing was shaped the other animals will usually follow right so you

01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:31.900
remove the distractions that the lead animals reacting to and and at this particular plant

01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:35.900
we had two things we had to get rid of we had to get rid of the shadow the spider monster shadow

01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:39.820
and we had to get rid of an led light that was on the corner of a building

01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:49.100
so do you have any sense on of why the other animals come to rely on the lead animal like what's

01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:54.700
the lead animal being selected for or is it just a first mover well the leader of this lead animal

01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:59.900
you see there's different levels of fear in animals genetically some animals are more bold

01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:07.420
other animals are more shy or you can call those high and low fear and the animal that's more bold

01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:17.260
is more likely to be the leader than the animal that's more anxious and and and you know if you

01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:21.420
down with a bunch of cattle that have lived together all the time you know that there'll be

01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:26.140
certain animals that tend to be the leaders and then you've got the big one with the giant horns

01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:30.140
and she shoves everybody else away from the feed trough there's something that's very profound

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:35.580
about that because you're laying out the fact that it isn't the dominant animal that leads no

01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:41.100
and that it's the animal that's exploratory and that's somewhat willing to take risks that

01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:47.660
that's right but also absolutely also that the that the lead animal will spot anomaly right like

01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:53.500
the spider monster that you're describing and so it's not like they're they're so bold that

01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:59.100
they're completely without fear they're still acting cautiously in some sense all right so you

01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:03.500
can walk the lead animal down a chute and you can see what it's going to see and you can actually

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:07.420
do that because you go down there and do it but you also think that way you've got to bring your

01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:12.380
cat up really calmly to see because if you bring him up at a run then the leader just turns back

01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:17.260
and you don't know what it's reacting to oh yeah i said to him now bring him up nice and calm watch

01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:22.380
the leader come up the chute and when he stops he'll look right at the thing he doesn't like and

01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:27.580
he looked at the led light on the corner of the building then they texted me a picture of it and

01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:35.820
they got rid of that and that fixed the problem now have you have you have you developed some sort of

01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:42.940
picture of the class of things that stop cats yes yes i have the spider mode okay so tell me what

01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:48.940
sort of thing i have him to stop cattle i have pictures i have checklists of things to look for

01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:56.700
reflections on water at this particular plant there was a gate handle a gate handle that jiggled

01:20:56.700 --> 01:21:01.980
and it was right by the chute entrance i said that needs to be fixed so this gate handle doesn't

01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:10.140
vibrate so what's common do you what's common about the things that stop cattle in their tracks

01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:15.340
or or can you extract out well let's look at let's look at cattle's a prey species animal

01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:22.940
so you're looking for things that might be a danger some little little bits of rapid movement set

01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:30.860
them off and and something that's sort of like shouldn't be there like you can put a white plastic

01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:34.380
bottle in the entrance of the chute now about shut a meat plant down

01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:42.460
i they'll just keep turning back away from it turning back away from it right so they're looking

01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:47.100
for something that doesn't fit the environmental pattern and that's probably doing something like

01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:52.540
activating predator detection well that's right it's like that you know they they're looking for

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:58.700
stuff that you know a movement in the bushes maybe that's a mountain lion or a wolf some

01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:03.740
little movement in the bushes the other thing about new experiences if you take something

01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:09.180
like camera equipment cattle love camera equipment you put an expensive camera in the middle of the

01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:15.340
pasture they will come up and knock it over and lick it to death that's what they will do

01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:22.460
see things that are novel are attractive when the animal can voluntarily approach and scary if

01:22:22.460 --> 01:22:29.420
you suddenly shove it in their face you suddenly shove it in their face then it's scary right and

01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:35.820
so the best way that's a introduce new things to cattle is to let them voluntarily approach it

01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:40.220
i don't know how many times people say to me my horse was fine at home he went crazy at the show

01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:46.540
well you've got a lot of novel stuff they're like flags for example so you better get your horse used

01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:51.020
to flags before you go there and the best way to get them used to flags would be to decorate the

01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:57.580
pasture with flags and let your animal walk up and voluntarily approach them right right well you

01:22:57.580 --> 01:23:01.660
know that's exactly what you do in psychotherapy when you're trying to help people overcome

01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:06.620
aphobia right so if someone's afraid of an elevator and won't get in it that often happens

01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:15.020
with agoraphobia what you do is you say to them okay um let's start by imagining elevators so that's

01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:20.060
going to make you a bit nervous but imagine an elevator at some distance that doesn't make you

01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:27.180
uncomfortable okay okay and then you say okay well now you've done that see if you can move yourself

01:23:27.180 --> 01:23:33.100
in your mind closer to the elevator door and then you keep doing that but it has to be voluntary

01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:38.060
it's 100% absolutely necessary for it to be okay so maybe you run them through this

01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:43.340
imaginal exposure therapy and then you say okay for our next session what we're going to do is

01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:46.620
we're going to go out in the hallway you know that elevator you wouldn't take we're going to go out

01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:51.420
in the hallway we're going to stand 200 feet away from the elevator and you're just going to look at

01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:57.500
it if you can't and so they'll do that has to be voluntary and then you can get them 150 feet away

01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:03.260
and 100 feet away and soon they'll be right up to the elevator door I was very anxious

01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:10.620
I you know my 20s and I got terrified of airplanes because I was an extremely scary

01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:15.420
emergency landing when I was a senior in high school they put the slides down and the whole thing

01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:21.740
very very scary and one of the ways I got over that is I had to make aviation interesting

01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:28.140
and when I got the ride in the cockpit of a plane flying on Holstein Hefers to Puerto Rico

01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:36.620
that made it interesting you make something scary interesting because I know another thing they do

01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:41.660
on the elevator phobias is they show them how the safety mechanisms work that the elevator is not

01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:48.700
going to fall down the shaft yeah well you you you know you even compel that interest to some

01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:55.340
degree so for example one once you get a phobic person inside an elevator what they'll tend to do

01:24:55.340 --> 01:25:01.660
is look at their feet and so you say to them look quit looking at your feet look at each corner of

01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:08.460
the elevator look at all the numbers look at the display panel like you have to facilitate their

01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:14.220
voluntary visual exploration okay and to some degree what you're doing is you're calling out

01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:19.420
their interest to say attend to all of these things as if they're interesting and then that's

01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:24.220
how they familiarize themselves with the elevator and they also note that well they're in there

01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:28.620
because you have to look at the elevator to know you're in an elevator right literally you have to

01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:33.420
move your eyes and point at all the different parts of the elevator and the more that you can help

01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:39.980
people do that at a high level of detailed resolution voluntarily the more likely they are not not

01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:44.940
only to become less afraid of the elevator is that that actually isn't what happens is you actually

01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:50.700
train them in a form of exploratory bravery because what you teach them is that if they use

01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:56.780
their eyes voluntarily to scan what they're afraid of they'll become braver and then that generalizes

01:25:56.780 --> 01:26:03.180
to all sorts of other instances too so if you train someone to be less afraid of an elevator

01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:08.860
they're much less afraid of other things as well well that's right and the thing that we're saying

01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:14.220
I'm seeing now in dogs you know we have very strict lease laws here and there's more problems with

01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:18.700
dogs being afraid of the veterinarian because they haven't been out experiencing enough stuff

01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:24.220
like strange people touching them for example just going to lots of different places you know this is

01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:30.380
the reason why when they train service dog puppies you take them everywhere so that there's almost

01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:37.980
nothing that will frighten them yes yeah well that that that's the same argument you were making

01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:42.140
earlier about the fact that to train people practically we have to put them in a lot of

01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:47.420
different practical hands-on situations and so that they can generalize across all those instances

01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:53.740
and so experience that's too narrow is too is too restrictive well when I get worried that

01:26:53.740 --> 01:27:00.620
we're going to have people making policy on all kinds of important stuff on when they're so far

01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:06.460
removed from the world of the practical you see we need to have both because all the problem with

01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:12.780
us practical people is we're not organized enough that's where just about every tech company

01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:18.540
has to hire a suit eventually just to keep the company organized somebody's got to pay the payroll

01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:24.540
somebody's got to pay the taxes somebody has to make sure the rent is paid you know if they need

01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:31.180
more office space then they've got to go out and go shopping for office space you know they there's

01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:38.220
uh and we really do need all the different kinds of minds well when I look at the ideological

01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:43.980
solutions that are being put forward to the world's problems continually I do wonder the same thing

01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:50.860
you're wondering about which is is this empty ideological representation a consequence of

01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:54.940
the fact that the people who are doing this have no practical experience at all it's like

01:27:54.940 --> 01:28:00.460
they're not thinking at the level of detail well I think that it's a problem because when I worked

01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:05.820
originally this is over 20 years ago with McDonald's Burger King and Wendy's and they took the top

01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:11.980
managers out into the field and implemented the auditing program it was interesting to see how the

01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:18.940
animal welfare uh issue went from an abstraction give it to legal give it to public relations

01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:24.940
to something real that they really needed to address you know half-dead animals going into your

01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:31.020
products not okay right right right uh broken stunning equipment is totally terrible and not

01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:38.620
okay and that's mainly a management problem and failure to do maintenance and and I and and and

01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:44.860
and when I worked on that 1999 I got five journal articles published on this and I saw more change

01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:51.020
than I'd seen and and in my whole career when these big companies were inspecting these plants

01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:57.740
but I figured out a very simple scoring system if you couldn't shoot 95 of those cattle dead on

01:28:57.740 --> 01:29:03.180
the first shot you failed the McDonald's audit it was that simple some very simple critical control

01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:07.020
points if you had more than three percent of your cattle beller in their heads off when you're

01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:12.780
handling them you failed the McDonald's audit okay so why why why did that turn out to be the critical

01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:19.660
issue well the broken stunts were a big issue now on the handling I figured out a way to score

01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:24.940
that that's very simple vocalization if you're poking cattle with too many electric prods or you're

01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:30.860
slamming doors on them or whatever they're going to be beller in their heads off and I better not

01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:35.500
hear any beller in coming out of the place where they kill them right here beller in coming out of

01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:40.860
there somebody needs to get kicked off the approved supplier list it's that simple that's one of the

01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:47.020
critical control right so you used so you used animal distress as an indication of that's right

01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:51.980
efficiency of process okay can you can you walk us through some of your designs

01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:57.820
I mean you designed these these circular cattle enclosures as well to calm them down

01:29:57.820 --> 01:30:02.940
the circular designs are really nice but I'm also very proud of the fact there were 75 plants

01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:09.020
on the McDonald's approved supplier list only three had to buy fancy expensive equipment

01:30:09.740 --> 01:30:13.820
everybody else we fixed with management yeah three managers had to be removed I call that

01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:19.340
manager ectomy on a lot of non-slip flooring had to go in because one of the things we measure

01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:26.940
is slipping and falling and lighting cattle are scared of the dark on training people to move

01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:33.900
smaller groups of animals and and put a solid side up so they don't see the vehicles passing by

01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:39.660
and these very simple changes we were able to fix some of the older places and I'm very I used all

01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:44.780
my design ability to figure out how to make some of the older facilities work even though they did

01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:51.980
not have the fancy new equipment and then we had three science only three plants had to do a front

01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:57.500
end remodel that was very very expensive that's three out of 75 I'm really proud of that oh yeah

01:30:57.500 --> 01:31:04.460
that's all a big port yeah yeah plants in the US right so so tell me tell me tell me tell me what

01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:09.420
your goals were okay so let's walk this through at the level of detail so why don't you tell people

01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:15.100
about how these cattle handling plants work broadly speaking from from the time the cattle arrived

01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:20.700
till the time they're processed let's say and then how were you brought in to fix them well

01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:27.500
unloading a truck make sure you have a non-slip unloading ramp open the gates up let them out

01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:31.580
you do not need to scream at them pound on the vehicle or stick electric prads in through the

01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:37.660
holes in the side of the truck so let the cattle just get off and they will and then they should

01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:43.180
walk quietly out of the truck if they got a scale weigh them on the scale and then quietly walk into

01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:47.980
a holding pen get a drink of water maybe a lay down then when it's time to go up to the plant

01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:55.660
somebody should come down bring a group of 20 out not a group of 50 and you quietly walk them up

01:31:55.660 --> 01:32:01.980
the alley to where they get to where the round crowd pen is and the whole thing should be a calm walk

01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:09.020
without slipping and falling and without moving and bellowing and and almost no electric prads

01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:14.380
that and it should all be very calm walking is what it should be

01:32:16.380 --> 01:32:23.900
right and and how many plants did you go analyze we had 75 plants on the on the approved supplier

01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:30.860
list and only three of them had to have extensive renovations but we did have three plants where

01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:36.780
the plant manager had to be removed right and so in those cases yeah why did you remove the managers

01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:41.100
well the ones where we're able to get rid of the plant manager were the corporate ones

01:32:41.820 --> 01:32:47.500
on the plant then we had one plant we used to call the problem child and manager was family and we

01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:51.740
couldn't get rid of it and that plant would like you know fail on audit and then pass an audit and

01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:59.660
but management has to decide that they're going to do things right you can have the best equipment

01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:06.380
and it's not going to work if it's not managed in fact before we started these audits i had a

01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:11.660
lot of equipment out in the field lots of equipment half my clients tore it up and wrecked it and one

01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:18.860
that what the customer inspections and audits did is force the plant to manage the stuff they had

01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:27.180
either brand new fancy stuff or older stuff and so how broadly did your innovation spread and how

01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:31.900
rapidly and what were the consequences of that for the meat handling industry in general

01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:38.140
well the auditing program was within six months as in the year of 1999 was adopted by mcdonald's

01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:43.660
wendys and burger king and that covers just about all the big beef plants and i saw more

01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:50.620
improvement than i'd seen in a 25 year career prior to that people were no longer using broken

01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:57.340
equipment they were moving smaller groups of animals things were kept repaired and

01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:02.140
and employees were better supervised and boy it made a big difference

01:34:03.340 --> 01:34:08.700
so why do you think you were able to do this i mean you obviously can solve the problem

01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:15.660
practically but how are you able to um make your way in the corporate world in a manner that actually

01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:20.940
resulted a in people listening to you and b in changes actually being made because that's

01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:26.300
that's quite a remarkable combination of unlikely achievements all right let's start off i started

01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:32.620
out with equipment this was in my 20s and i found that selling equipment was much easier than getting

01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:37.660
people to manage equipment correctly and early in my career i made the mistake that a lot of young

01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:45.340
engineers make i thought i could make a self managing cattle handling facility that is bs and i got a

01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:49.820
lot of systems out there the other thing that helped me to get systems out into the industry

01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:55.980
is i wrote about them and i wrote about them in the meat industry and cattle industry trade press

01:34:56.940 --> 01:35:02.380
wrote all kinds of articles just about how to do it so now i had a lot of equipment out there

01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:07.660
center track restrainer and lots and lots of these big plants had one it's a piece of equipment i

01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:13.340
developed with the guys in the shops that i've talked to you about earlier but half my clients tore

01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:19.340
it up and wrecked it then i worked with a lady named janet riley at the american meat institute

01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:27.340
and i came up with this very very simple scoring system for evaluating meat packing plants

01:35:28.060 --> 01:35:34.620
and we wrote it up in our guidelines nobody used it for two years then mcdonald's approached me

01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:43.580
to implement their animal welfare auditing program and it started out taking vice president level

01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:50.780
managers out of the office they saw some bad stuff and it started out as a little training program

01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:56.540
they already had food safety auditors in the plants auditing them that was already being done

01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:01.900
and so i took the trains of food safety auditors to do the animal welfare audit

01:36:02.220 --> 01:36:09.100
and within six months i saw more change that i had seen in my whole career prior to that

01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:14.140
then wendy's got on board then burger king got on board and i made sure that everybody used the

01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:20.060
exact same score so it was absolutely clear it was like traffic rules you know you know they

01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:25.420
measure speeding we measured how many vocalizations the cattle did we measured how many animals

01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:31.020
fell down those things were measured and the plants had to make certain numbers it was

01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:35.900
absolutely clear there were five critical control points and they had to do all five of them to

01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:40.780
pass the audit i kind of sometimes can't believe i pulled it off it worked me on my wildest dreams

01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:49.100
but it was absolutely practical right right yeah well it did it is it is quite a remarkable

01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:53.660
thing to pull off to to be able to make that kind of change in the corporate world so quickly that's

01:36:53.660 --> 01:36:58.860
that's really quite remarkable the other reason i was able to make change i i practiced reverse

01:36:58.860 --> 01:37:04.380
conflict of interest i had a lot of expensive equipment already out in the plants i've been

01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:10.700
over backwards in the older facilities to figure out how to make that older facility work without

01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:16.300
buying expensive equipment let me tell you non-slip flooring it can work wonders you know we did quite

01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:22.220
a lot of that right but that's not that's not expensive equipment and i'm really proud of the

01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:26.380
fact that i took some of the older facilities and we made them work and then we did have three

01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:33.100
only three out of 75 plants that had to build an expensive front-end remodel and that was very

01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:42.540
expensive so what would you say if if you had to put it into a few phrases you you weren't obviously

01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:47.980
pursuing mere narrow profit at that time not there's anything wrong with profit you you were

01:37:47.980 --> 01:37:54.300
serving some other goal i was serving the goal of improving animal welfare and i've been over

01:37:54.300 --> 01:38:01.100
backwards to do reverse conflict of interest and i tried to take some of those older facilities

01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:09.020
right some of them a bit shabby and make them work with simple changes like repairs non-slip

01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:14.780
flooring changing the lighting and three plants had to have the plant manager removed and that's

01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:20.620
great so what why were you why were you so concerned with animal welfare and how would you

01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:25.820
define animal welfare why did that become paramount in your in your hierarchy of goals

01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:30.620
well one of the reasons why i started working on the equipment is like the way cattle were

01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:35.980
being handled was horrible you know electric prods on 100 i'm falling down crashing into things

01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:41.340
people screaming at them uh cattle handling in the 80s was terrible absolutely terrible

01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:48.780
and i i saw that as something that i could fix now i talked to a lot of young people the day

01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:53.660
that want to you know do activism about some specific thing and it's way too broad

01:38:53.660 --> 01:38:58.300
i want justice in the world for example right yes yes might be something they would say yes yes

01:38:58.300 --> 01:39:04.140
and i say why don't you do something more targeted like using dna to show that this prisoner

01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:10.460
was falsely accused you see now that's something a lot more targeted that you can actually do

01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:15.820
yes absolutely and i think that is a huge problem with the way that kids are trained

01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:24.220
morally in universities is that that grandiose vague uh activism replaces the actual practicalities

01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:28.380
of problem solving that you're describing that actually make a difference why do you think it

01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:33.740
was that animal suffering stood out for you is it is it partly because you you can think like

01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:37.660
animals like what why do you think well you would how would you like to get shocked to electric

01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:42.700
prods and be slipping and falling and crashing and defenses and things like that you'd be terrified

01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:51.500
um and my goal was to improve how the cattle were treated when i talked to students about you

01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:58.700
know activism i said what i worked on wasn't everything bad happening to animals i worked

01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:03.340
on something targeted the thing that i'm seeing now with young people that want to make a difference

01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:08.460
they say i want to have justice in the world or i want to like animals are treated terrible we got

01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:14.940
to do something about it and i'm saying you're going to be more effective if you pick out something

01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:21.500
relatively targeted i worked on cattle handling to start with that's not everything to do with animals

01:40:22.540 --> 01:40:28.940
yes exactly or the example of using dna to show that this criminal was innocent that's something

01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:35.740
much more doable and targeted that you can actually do right so how was it that the suffering of

01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:41.340
animals in meat tracking in meat packing plants came to your attention to begin with so you said

01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:47.100
the suffering you found that unbearable first of all it started out when i went out to the feed yards

01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:51.500
handling cattle back in the 70s there's a lot of really horrible cattle handling

01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:59.260
and i i made a mistake in the beginning that a lot of young engineers make they think technology

01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:05.420
can solve all their problems and i mistakenly believed that i could build a self managing

01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:11.500
cattle handling facility that's nonsense i know that now that's nonsense good equipment makes

01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:16.860
good handling better but it doesn't replace management and what the auditing program did

01:41:16.860 --> 01:41:23.100
is it forced people to manage the facilities and why why were you at the cattle handling facilities

01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:27.740
to begin with i mean was this part of your academic training or was this part of the fact

01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:33.180
that you'd grown up on a farm well i got interested in got to going out to my aunt's ranch and

01:41:33.180 --> 01:41:37.340
this brings up the other thing students get interested in stuff they get exposed to

01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:44.700
it's that simple in in one of the people i profiled in visual thinking was michael angelo

01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:51.260
grubby little 12 year old dropped out of school but he was running around all the churches seeing

01:41:51.260 --> 01:41:57.420
great art and he grew up with stone cutting tools okay that's the exposure then he started

01:41:57.420 --> 01:42:01.820
making some stuff and then an artist took him in as an apprentice that's mentoring

01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:07.340
good careers start first with exposure and the other reason why i'm so concerned about

01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:12.380
taking all the hands-on stuff out of the schools is those things like let's say theater for example

01:42:12.380 --> 01:42:19.020
exposed students i didn't care about being in the play but i loved making scene rate and costumes

01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:26.140
that i love to do it now that's something that can become a career so let me let me we're running

01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:30.140
out of time on this segment let me ask you one more question and then maybe i'll sum up our

01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:35.820
discussion for everybody or try to extract out the gist you think primarily in pictures but you're

01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:40.380
also an extremely effective verbal communicator i mean you've written a number of books you can

01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:46.060
obviously talk your way into corporate environments and help people walk through the complex process

01:42:46.060 --> 01:42:50.940
of restructuring say animal handling on a pretty much on a national scale how did you

01:42:51.660 --> 01:42:56.540
how do you think you've been able to develop your verbal ability like what what did you do to

01:42:56.540 --> 01:43:01.740
manage that all right it goes back to when i was seven years old and in my neighborhood all the

01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:06.060
kids when they were seven when the parents had a party you had to put your good clothes on greet

01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:12.620
the guests and serve the snacks be little hosts and hostesses that's what you had to do um i sold

01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:18.620
candy for charity that helped me on talking to people the other thing i figured out very early on

01:43:18.620 --> 01:43:24.780
is backdoors into jobs and most people don't see this in the hbo movie temple grand and there's a

01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:30.780
scene where i go up to the editor of our state farm magazine and i get his card because i knew if i

01:43:30.780 --> 01:43:37.980
wrote for that magazine that would help my career that's a back door writing i did a lot of writing

01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:44.700
this how to handle cattle how to design facilities and i was so happy when one of my very early

01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:50.780
articles got picked up by two other magazines you know it had made the national scene of course this

01:43:50.780 --> 01:43:56.620
is all you know pre-internet and then that press pass got me into all kinds of meetings that helped

01:43:56.620 --> 01:44:03.660
me to get into my next self-made internship with a swift plant i've recognized the back doors most

01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:09.020
people don't recognize the back doors but lots of good jobs are gotten through the back door

01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:16.860
right so you allied your ability to concentrate on focal details practically with the ability

01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:21.740
and the willingness to communicate on at all sorts of different levels verbally

01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:27.260
you were able to bring both that's getting too abstract for me i just go okay i got the card

01:44:27.340 --> 01:44:32.780
within a week i i may i had done a master's thesis on cattle behavior in different types of

01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:39.660
squeeze shoots and i i sent them a good article and they published it then i went back to them and

01:44:39.660 --> 01:44:45.340
said maybe i could just write something for you every month i just walked into the office and

01:44:45.340 --> 01:44:49.180
asked that job so i did that as a volunteer for about three or four months and then they started

01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:59.020
paying me i wasn't shy to walk up and ask right right so so you developed a communication

01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:03.740
communication expertise and a communication network at the same time that you were trying to

01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:08.860
implement your practical solutions and both of those facilitated each other well in the very

01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:14.620
beginning i wasn't even designing facilities and then i was just visiting all these feed yards

01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:20.860
and writing for the magazine and that press pass got me into all kinds of places

01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:27.500
i recognized the value of that press pass it got me into meetings in the 70s with $600

01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:34.060
registration fees i was no way i could have afforded that this is 70s right right right

01:45:34.060 --> 01:45:39.020
so what are what are you working on now you finished this this new book that came out in 2022

01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:44.220
what are you doing now well i'm very interested in seeing the kids who think differently

01:45:44.220 --> 01:45:50.380
get into good careers and that's going to be a major emphasis of the things that i do now be a

01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:55.500
lot of speaking engagements a lot of you know interviews like this because i want to see those

01:45:55.500 --> 01:46:02.060
kids that are different get into good jobs okay if they're visual object visualizer like me maybe

01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:08.220
art job maybe photography job or a job building things if they're the more mathematical visual

01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:15.660
spatial a good programming job a good on mathematics or chemistry job where you need the

01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:21.260
mathematics there's too many kids that think differently i'm some of them just kind of going

01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:27.500
nowhere i want to see them get into good careers and do things that will be constructive in the

01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:35.740
world do something constructive so we're we're going to switch over to the additional half an

01:46:35.740 --> 01:46:40.380
hour that i produced for the daily wire plus platform to delve into some of the biographical

01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:46.380
details of your life before we close i'd like to just sort of wander over the territory that we've

01:46:46.380 --> 01:46:50.460
covered and see if there's anything else see if you think this is a reasonable summary and if

01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:56.220
there's anything else you want to add i've been talking with dr. temple grand in today

01:46:56.220 --> 01:47:04.140
who's who's developed a spectacular career in modifying animal handling and also managed a lot

01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:09.340
on the more purely intellectual front as well in terms of conceptualization of information

01:47:09.340 --> 01:47:17.340
processing she's uh we talked a lot today about the difference in in in the ways that people think

01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:22.460
concentrating mostly on the distinction between visual thinkers who tend to be more practical

01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:28.220
and detail oriented and who are can be broadly differentiated into two categories and those

01:47:28.220 --> 01:47:35.020
would be object visualizers and people who think more visually and mathematically contrasting them

01:47:35.020 --> 01:47:41.340
with people who think more verbally we talked a fair bit about the prioritization of more verbal

01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:47.820
and abstract thinking at the cost of this practical thinking and training in that practical thinking

01:47:47.820 --> 01:47:53.340
we discussed how that's affected the school system and broader culture we discussed the dangers that

01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:59.180
poses to the integrity of our society as we lose the people who have the hands-on knowledge

01:47:59.180 --> 01:48:05.020
we talked about the psychological danger that poses to people who think more practically

01:48:05.020 --> 01:48:11.420
concretely and and visually who are in school systems that are optimized for the verbal thinkers

01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:22.460
we talked about temples um career at the detail level um ameliorating the suffering of animals

01:48:22.460 --> 01:48:29.580
that across like nationally and internationally as it turned out partly because she decided

01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:36.300
not to chase mere generalities but to focus on an actual problem which was the suffering of actual

01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:43.740
animals in actual plants was willing to focus her um emotional concerns on something that was

01:48:43.740 --> 01:48:49.420
practical and to marry that with a strategy that involved particularization and visualization

01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:55.740
and verbal communication and practical interactions with corporations and also we closed

01:48:55.740 --> 01:49:00.540
that with a discussion of the fact that what she's doing now is trying to bring to people's

01:49:00.540 --> 01:49:08.060
attention in podcasts like this the fact that we seem to be um working contrary to our own

01:49:08.620 --> 01:49:17.820
best interests by not um building educational facilities that help optimize the ability of

01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:24.620
visual thinkers to function but also for society more broadly to take advantage of the

01:49:24.620 --> 01:49:30.460
talents and skills of those people in the in innovation and in the maintenance of the infrastructure

01:49:30.460 --> 01:49:35.660
that we already have around us and so I think that about summarizes what we talked about today

01:49:35.660 --> 01:49:41.020
is there anything you want to add to that that definitely you know kind of um kind of summarizes

01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:45.580
that we need all the different kinds of minds and they can when we understand that different

01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:51.660
people think differently they can work in teams where they can collaborate and have complementary

01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:58.540
skills I think that's that's uh something that's really important also right right right the thing

01:49:58.540 --> 01:50:04.300
I want to one thing I would do with the schools is I'd put a lot of the hands-on classes back in

01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:11.100
like art sewing woodworking shop welding auto mechanics theater because these are all things

01:50:11.660 --> 01:50:15.740
expose kids to to things that can become possible careers too

01:50:17.980 --> 01:50:21.980
right and those are all things that have to be done they're in an embodied sense you actually

01:50:21.980 --> 01:50:27.420
have to it's not purely abstract any it's not abstract none of those things are abstract

01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:33.900
yeah well that's I suppose a danger of moving so much education online as well as that it's going

01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:40.140
to increase the degree well that's right the other thing when I went to did the book signing

01:50:40.140 --> 01:50:44.380
for visual thinking I told you about the electrical engineering book from the 30s I found in this

01:50:44.380 --> 01:50:50.700
unique hotel room but I also got put in the office of a professor in political science

01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:57.420
and I looked at some of those books and it was so abstract theories about politics I I didn't

01:50:57.420 --> 01:51:03.500
even understand it it had nothing to do with right or left it had to do with just abstractions

01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:08.780
that were so abstract it made no sense to me now I'm going oh I wouldn't want this person in charge of

01:51:08.780 --> 01:51:15.260
figuring out with the power bread you know I remember at this Tucson conference where I first

01:51:15.260 --> 01:51:21.260
saw you speak after you spoke very practical talk very much like the one that you you delivered

01:51:21.260 --> 01:51:25.980
today when we were talking a philosophy student got up because there were a lot of abstract thinkers

01:51:25.980 --> 01:51:32.140
at this consciousness conference and asked you something extremely abstract and philosophical

01:51:32.140 --> 01:51:37.260
and you did exactly what I would expect a good engineer to do which was to say you know I really

01:51:37.260 --> 01:51:41.980
don't understand anything that you just said I don't know how to associate it with anything

01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:46.940
practical and I'm completely unable to answer your question which I thought was just it was

01:51:46.940 --> 01:51:53.820
ridiculously comical and I also thought um what would you say well targeted because it was the case

01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:58.620
that you know you had been talking about real practical realities your ability to think like

01:51:58.620 --> 01:52:04.140
an animal the fact that you had taken these practical set steps to ameliorate animal suffering

01:52:04.140 --> 01:52:12.380
and that that had been so consequential and and so of obvious worth and then you were faced with this

01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:18.540
flight into abstraction and and did what engineers always did do which is something like well yeah

01:52:18.540 --> 01:52:22.700
but I don't understand that what does it mean practically which is a really good question

01:52:22.700 --> 01:52:26.940
that you know it's a question that should be asked of abstract thinkers all the time what are the

01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:32.780
devils in the details here that you're overlooking how much do you know about the systems that you're

01:52:32.780 --> 01:52:38.940
abstractly representing and the answer to that is usually almost nothing well it's sort of like

01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:43.580
you know we need all the three different base you know different kinds of minds you need the

01:52:43.580 --> 01:52:49.980
object visualizers you know we're going to get the arts mechanical and photography and animals

01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:55.740
you need the visual spatial mathematicians computer programmers chemists things that require

01:52:55.740 --> 01:53:01.900
mathematics and we need the verbal thinkers because they're going to help organize things

01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:07.420
you see you need yeah all three different kinds of minds and they should work together in a

01:53:07.420 --> 01:53:14.460
complementary fashion all right well that's a good place to end this segment I would say I'm going

01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:20.220
to go thank you thank you to everyone on YouTube and the associated podcast for your time and

01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:26.220
attention I hope you found this discussion interesting and engaging and practically useful

01:53:26.220 --> 01:53:32.140
as well I'm going to switch switch over to the daily wire plus platform and I'm going to talk to

01:53:32.140 --> 01:53:37.660
dr. temple grand and a little bit more on the biographical and I want to lay out how her

01:53:37.660 --> 01:53:42.780
her interest in the issues that she did pursue professionally made themselves manifest in her

01:53:42.780 --> 01:53:48.940
life hello everyone I would encourage you to continue listening to my conversation with my

01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:53.980
guest on dailywireplus.com
