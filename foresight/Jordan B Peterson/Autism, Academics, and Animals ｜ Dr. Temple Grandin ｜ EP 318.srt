1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,420
It's the Hebrews created history as we know it.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,500
You don't get away with anything and so you might think you can bend the fabric of reality

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,500
and that you can treat people instrumentally and that you can bow to the tyrant and violate

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,120
your conscience without cost.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,420
You will pay the piper.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,100
It's going to call you out of that slavery into freedom even if that pulls you into the

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,100
desert.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:30,700
And we're going to see that there's something else going on here that is far more cosmic

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,180
and deeper than what you can imagine.

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:41,460
The highest ethical spirit to which we're beholden is presented precisely as that spirit

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,940
that allies itself with the cause of freedom against tyranny.

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,940
Yes, exactly.

13
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,460
I want villains to get punished.

14
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,140
But do you want the villains to learn before they have to pay the ultimate price?

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,140
That's such a Christian question.

16
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,500
One of the reasons why I started working on the equipment is the way cattle were being

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,660
handled was horrible.

18
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,380
Electric prods on 100 percent of them falling down and crashing into things, people screaming

19
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,140
at them.

20
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,820
Cattle handling in the 80s was terrible, absolutely terrible.

21
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,740
And I saw that as something that I could fix.

22
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,220
Now I talked to a lot of young people today that want to do activism about some specific

23
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,580
thing and it's way too broad.

24
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,700
I want justice in the world, for example.

25
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,700
Right, yes, yes.

26
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,700
It might be something they would say.

27
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,700
Yes, yes.

28
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,060
And I say, why don't you do something more targeted, like using DNA to show that this

29
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,100
prisoner was falsely accused?

30
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,700
You see, now that's something a lot more targeted that you can actually do.

31
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,500
Yes, absolutely.

32
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,020
I think that is a huge problem with the way that kids are trained morally in universities

33
00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:02,060
is that that grandiose, vague activism replaces the actual practicalities of problem-solving

34
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,260
that you're describing that actually make a difference.

35
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:18,700
Hello, everyone.

36
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:25,820
I'm usually excited to have whoever I'm talking to that day on my show because I pick people

37
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,060
I'm excited about talking to.

38
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,020
But I'm particularly excited about my guest today, Dr. Temple Grandin.

39
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:37,740
Temple Grandin revolutionized the animal handling industry over the last 40 years and has done

40
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:43,340
more for animal welfare in a practical sense than anybody that I know of and perhaps anybody

41
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,340
on the planet.

42
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,900
I think you could make a case for that.

43
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,900
She's a remarkable person.

44
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,660
I saw her first in Tucson, Arizona.

45
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,300
I'll talk about that a little bit in our interview.

46
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,540
She gave one of the most compelling presentations I'd ever seen in an academic setting at a

47
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,460
conference on consciousness and saw that about 15 years ago.

48
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,020
And ever since then, I'd really been wanting to meet her and I got to do that today, so

49
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,340
that's so exciting.

50
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,620
So I'll just give you a brief bio and we'll pop into the interview.

51
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:15,140
Dr. Temple Grandin is a professor of animal sciences at Colorado State University.

52
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,620
Facilities she has designed for handling livestock are used by companies all around the world.

53
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,020
Her work has been instrumental in implementing animal welfare auditing programs, now used

54
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,900
by McDonald's, Wendy's, Whole Foods, and many other major corporations.

55
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:35,380
She has appeared on numerous shows across platforms such as 2020 Larry King Live and

56
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,380
Prime Time.

57
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:42,580
Dr. Grandin is also an accomplished author with books such as Thinking in Pictures,

58
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,700
Livestock Handling in Transport, and The Autistic Brain.

59
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:52,940
A few of her other publications, Animals in Translation, as well as Visual Thinking,

60
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,900
have even made it to the New York Times bestseller list.

61
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:02,460
In 2017, Dr. Grandin was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame, and in 2022,

62
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,540
she was honored once again as a Colorado State Distinguished Professor.

63
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:14,380
We're going to walk through her book today and we're going to learn what she has to

64
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,380
say now about thinking.

65
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,380
Let's start with Visual Thinking and Language.

66
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:25,900
So do you want to tell people about your realization and about different thought patterns?

67
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:31,780
When I was in my 20s, I thought everybody thought in pictures the way I thought.

68
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:37,180
I didn't know that other people thought in words until I was in my late 30s.

69
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,700
Now you've already mentioned how do I categorize?

70
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:47,660
Well, I explain as a child how I learned to categorize, categorizing with individual pictures.

71
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:54,820
So as a very young child, I categorized cats, dogs, and horses by size because in our neighborhood

72
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,300
at that time, there were no cattle and there were no small dogs.

73
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:05,940
Then a doxxant came into my neighborhood and she's the same size as a cat.

74
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,540
And I remember looking at the doxxant, she was a black doxxant, and trying to figure

75
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:16,300
out now what features does she share with the dog she barks.

76
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:22,140
Her nose shape is the same as a dog and she smells like a dog.

77
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:29,060
So I had to take other sensory-based things like smell and what the dog sounded like to

78
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,500
put the doxxant in the dog category.

79
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,060
So the way I formed categories is I have to have a bunch of information.

80
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:43,780
Let's take the cat category and you look at a leopard's face, a lion's face, and even

81
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:51,740
a house cat's face, there's similarities and they also smell all the same too.

82
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,980
If you go to the zoo, you can smell how they are different.

83
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:02,020
So the first step for abstract thinking is put making categories.

84
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:09,100
So when I finally figured out that other people did not think in pictures, if I asked most

85
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,860
people, visualize your own home, your dog, or your car, you will do it because you're

86
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,780
so familiar with that.

87
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:21,900
But one time at an autism conference, when I was in my late 30s, I asked a speech therapist

88
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:27,940
think about a church staple and I was shocked that all the only image she saw was a very

89
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:34,020
vague two lines like this, where I see specific churches.

90
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:41,260
They come up like a series of back then 35 millimeter slides, now the PowerPoint slides.

91
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:46,020
And then I can start as I see more and more of these churches, I can put them into New

92
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,740
England type category, stone cathedral type.

93
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,380
Looks like a warehouse and it has a little plastic steeple type.

94
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:01,220
I can make finer categories as I get more and more specific images.

95
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,860
It's bottom-up thinking and I learned that that's exactly how an artificial intelligence

96
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,620
program diagnosis melanoma cancer.

97
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:14,540
It's given a training set of 2,000 melanomas and another training set of every kind of

98
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:19,180
skin rash and mosquito bite and infected whatever.

99
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:24,020
And then it learns to categorize melanoma from non-melanoma.

100
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:28,980
And that was very insightful to me when I learned that that's how the simple type of

101
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:35,380
artificial intelligence programs work, diagnosing something like melanoma.

102
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:41,500
So let me ask you, when I'm thinking something through, now I can think in pictures and if

103
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,980
I'm building something or trying to design something to build, then I tend to think in

104
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,980
pictures.

105
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:55,980
But I would say 90% of the time my proclivity is to think in words and I would say in part

106
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:03,980
that's because my word thinking is so dominant, it just suppresses the image thinking.

107
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:09,540
And so a lot of my thinking, I would also say, takes the form of something like internal

108
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,540
argumentation.

109
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:17,820
So I'll ask myself a question, I'll think up an answer in words and then I'll think

110
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:22,740
up a bunch of reasons why that answer isn't sufficient and then I'll conduct an internal

111
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,740
argument.

112
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:29,060
And that's occupying me continually, like 16 hours a day non-stop.

113
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:34,180
And it's been like that ever since I was two years old, except for those times, let's say.

114
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:44,100
So yeah, so how do you conduct internal arguments or what accounts for the...

115
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,020
So part of the creativity in my thinking is the outcome of these arguments.

116
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:53,940
What you're thinking in pictures, so you're not having internal arguments, what's the

117
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,820
stream of your thought like?

118
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:02,260
Well, when it comes to things like designing equipment, I often will kind of, a lot of

119
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,820
equipment design, someone gets an idea from something else.

120
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,780
And one of my other books I wrote about the inventor of Velcro and he saw how Burdock

121
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:16,740
stuck on his clothes, cockled birds on those kind of things stuck on his clothes.

122
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,260
And that's where he got the idea for making Velcro.

123
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,060
That would be visual thinking.

124
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:29,620
The Burdocks and Velcro, they've got similarities on how they stick together.

125
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,900
In designing equipment, I can just see how it operates.

126
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:40,220
I worked with welders that had 20 patents each that barely graduated from high school,

127
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:45,460
but they could build any kind of a machine and invent industrial machinery.

128
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,700
They just see it in their head.

129
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:55,020
Right now, will you see, okay, so I read Nikolai Tesla's biography a long while back and it

130
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:01,660
was extremely interesting and he claimed, and I have no reason to disbelieve him, that

131
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:09,560
entire inventions, machines would pop into the theater of his imagination, detailed out

132
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,580
to the point where he knew the angles on the screws that held the metal together.

133
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:20,020
And he would try to write them down in something, draw them out in something approximating,

134
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:25,580
something that you could make a blueprint out of, let's say, in that much detail.

135
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:30,460
And sometimes a new invention would pop into his head so quickly that it would obliterate

136
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,100
the previous one.

137
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,460
He had to work very quickly to keep up.

138
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:39,620
And so there's that incredible fluency in visualization.

139
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:46,660
But then, as I said, in the verbal world, I'll think of an argument and counterarguments.

140
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:52,780
When you're thinking of industrial design, do you think of the object that you're attempting

141
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:57,020
to design and then multiple variants of it and test them against each other, or does

142
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:01,140
it just come to you as a solution for a given problem?

143
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,500
It almost sort of just pops into my head.

144
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,260
I also see mechanical abnormalities.

145
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:10,540
I remember walking in and someone had made a cardboard, old-fashioned locomotive.

146
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:16,540
The wheels have those links between them, and I go, they drew that wrong.

147
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,540
Wheels are not going to turn.

148
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:23,180
It was just a cartoon train for a party.

149
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,300
But I immediately noticed that they didn't draw it right.

150
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:31,300
The other thing is, is my thinking is associative.

151
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,100
All right.

152
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,740
Give me a key word, pretend I'm Google for images.

153
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:44,300
Not something I can see in here with books and papers all around and photography equipment

154
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,540
and stuff all around me, but something kind of a creative key word.

155
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:56,580
And I'll tell you how I access my memory for that key word.

156
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,820
Start the new year off right with black rifle coffee.

157
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,060
Black rifle has all the best brewing gear, thermos, mugs, and apparel designed for folks

158
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,980
who love country and coffee.

159
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,660
Black rifle sources the most exotic roasts from around the globe.

160
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,900
All coffee is roasted here in the U.S. by veteran-led teams of coffee experts.

161
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:20,660
Every purchase you make with black rifle helps support veteran and first responder causes.

168
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:52,660
So and with regard, so my wife has a very powerful visual imagination.

169
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,540
She's able to do all sorts of remarkable things with it.

170
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:03,860
And one of the things that strikes me as highly probable is that her capacity for visual imagery

171
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,540
is a lot more intense than mine.

172
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:13,260
And so like I was a fairly vivid dreamer for years, especially when I was reading Carl

173
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,540
Jung's work in graduate school.

174
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,860
Don't seem to dream much now or not, well, I don't remember them much now.

175
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:25,900
When I do think in pictures, it's not as vivid as seeing the real world.

176
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,580
It's maybe 5% of that.

177
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:34,100
It's sort of, it's, it's, well, it just doesn't have that intensity.

178
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,780
What about, and you, and you?

179
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,580
Oh no, it's very, very vivid.

180
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:44,420
And, and while I was, while you were setting up all the camera equipment, here I found on

181
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,020
here's a whole bunch of papers.

182
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:51,260
More papers I've found online supporting the, a lot of the things that are in the book.

183
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:56,500
I just got surfing around and boy, you can sometimes find some great stuff when you look

184
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
at the citations.

185
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,500
No, but it's very, very vivid.

186
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,940
I don't know, it's, it's completely vivid.

187
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:08,700
Now when you mentioned the word imagination, I remember going to a long time ago, Disney

188
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:15,100
World, a kind of a ride that had imagination with people and dirigibles and things like

189
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,180
that.

190
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:21,100
You know, then I visited a studio where they, where Disney made a whole bunch of their stuff.

191
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,100
I'm now seeing that.

192
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,580
Yes, I'm now seeing a non-disclosure agreement.

193
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,740
So I can't tell you what I did there.

194
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:36,580
And I, but I, now I'm seeing a very interesting discussion we had about designing things where,

195
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,820
where you're designing things, there's the decoration part of it.

196
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,340
And then there's, then there's a mechanical part of, of a machine.

197
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:49,020
Of course, at an amusement park, you want to have decorations, but you also, the rides

198
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,660
have to mechanically work.

199
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,980
They're kind of two separate things that were kind of done by two separate departments.

200
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:02,500
You also spoke in your book about your ability to see things out of place.

201
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:09,780
And so one of the things that characterizes autism is the fact that at least some autistic

202
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:15,700
people are not very happy when they walk into a room, say that they're familiar with

203
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,500
and one thing is out of place.

204
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:23,420
So for example, an autistic child might walk into a dining room and one of the chairs is,

205
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,420
you know, tilted 45 degrees to the right or to the left instead of being put straight

206
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,420
in.

207
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:34,140
And what seems to happen, correct me if, if you feel that I'm wrong, is that the fact

208
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:41,100
that that chair is now askew means that the entire room is different in some important

209
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,100
and emotionally significant way.

210
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,220
So there's this response to anomaly.

211
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,700
I don't have that issue.

212
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:53,500
That's not an issue for me, but if there's one pixel off on an electronic sign, I will

213
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,500
notice that.

214
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:01,340
I remember one time walking into the airport with somebody else and the United Ticket Counter

215
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,340
sign was a whole row of television monitors.

216
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:10,220
And there must have been 20 TV monitors making the word United over and over again.

217
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,900
And one of the screens was scrambled, the whole screen.

218
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,900
And I immediately saw it and I said to the person beside me, did you see that that sign

219
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,180
was messed up?

220
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,420
No, they did not see it.

221
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,260
They were right beside me when we walked in.

222
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,460
I immediately saw it.

223
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,660
Now that it upset me, no, I just noticed that the sign was scrambled.

224
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,660
Right.

225
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,780
But it didn't upset you.

226
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,780
No.

227
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:36,300
So yeah, so that's that interesting.

228
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,700
So for me, I think I can detect anomalies visually.

229
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:47,300
So for example, one of the things I learned to do when I was setting up my house and renovating

230
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:53,180
places and setting up my offices, like arranging my local environment, was to sit in the room

231
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,940
and become meditative in some sense.

232
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:04,460
And then to feel out what was bothering me about the room, like what ugly feature might

233
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:08,060
pop out, what part of it needed to be attended to.

234
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,060
Right.

235
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:15,820
And I think I was tuning myself to detect what was abnormal in relationship to the underlying

236
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,140
aesthetic or the pattern of the room.

237
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:24,020
But that pops out for you almost instantaneously.

238
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,300
For me, anomaly detection is mostly verbal.

239
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:31,500
Again, it's like all think up an argument and then think up counter arguments.

240
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:37,580
And if one argument and the other don't jive, if they're contradictory, then that pops out

241
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,580
for me.

242
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:45,020
Well, it's sort of like I fly all the time to like I know when the pilots do the checklist.

243
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:51,300
And like we push back, and we just take too long to turn, I'm going, uh-oh, we're going

244
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,700
to have an air traffic control delay.

245
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:59,940
And I can often predict that before they announce it.

246
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:06,220
And I also can, I'm very conscious of on the biggest airplane, when they start the little

247
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,820
gentle push to push it back from the gate, I can feel it on the biggest aircraft there

248
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,820
is.

249
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,820
Right.

250
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:20,940
And I just want to get there and I'm going, oh, please push back.

251
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,700
But it's sort of like I don't get upset about it.

252
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,140
It's just anything that's not routine.

253
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:32,580
I instantly notice it and I go, oh, crap, I see a vest that says tech ops.

254
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,180
We may have a delayed flight.

255
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,900
Now that brings up another thing I want to talk about.

256
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:43,620
In the last month, I've had, okay, a mechanic come on a plane twice and both mechanics had

257
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,060
gray hair.

258
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:51,580
And this brings up a major issue that's in my book about skill loss, especially skill

259
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,380
loss with mechanical things.

260
00:18:54,380 --> 00:19:00,100
I've been on a lot of questionable elevators and escalators lately that definitely needed

261
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,300
servicing.

262
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,980
And what's happening, and this is in my screened out chapter, is the kids are getting screened

263
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,700
out of these trades because they've taken the shop classes out of the schools 20 years

264
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:17,060
ago and we have so many higher math requirements that you don't need for something like fixing

265
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:22,820
elevators that the kids are playing video games in the basement on an autism diagnosis

266
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,060
instead of fixing elevators.

267
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:29,940
There's a relationship here between what goes on with industrial things and what's going

268
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:35,540
on at school, which is a major, major thing that I'm interested in talking about.

269
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,380
Yeah, so let's talk about that a little bit.

270
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,260
That's one of the things that popped out for me from your book.

271
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,860
So I was trying to think that through.

272
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:51,220
So you make the claim as you just laid out that our education system and maybe our entire

273
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:59,100
culture as it's hypothetically deindustrializing is actually working against the best interests

274
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:04,460
of those who think mechanically, those who think in pictures, and those who can do hands

275
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,580
on work.

276
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:11,700
And here's a paper I just dug off of Google Scholar on visual objectability, a new dimension

277
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,780
of nonverbal intelligence.

278
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:20,340
And what a lot of educators don't understand is that object visualization, especially on

279
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:25,220
solving mechanical problems, it is a different way of thinking.

280
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:29,540
I worked with people that barely graduated from high school, stutterers.

281
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,060
They'd be labeled autistic to date.

282
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:37,100
They'd be in special ed, but they had big metal working shops and 20 patents each for

283
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:41,580
mechanically complicated equipment that they are selling around the world.

284
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:47,180
And this is something that educators just don't get it.

285
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:53,260
And the reason why I wrote this book, I'll tell you what was the reason.

286
00:20:53,260 --> 00:21:00,420
In 2019, just before COVID shut everything down, I went to four places and I realized

287
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,340
the magnitude of the skill loss.

288
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:09,900
The first one was a pork processing plant where most of the equipment came from Holland.

289
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,140
I went to another pork processing plant, equipment coming from Holland.

290
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,180
Then I went to a poultry processing plant where all of the specialized equipment came

291
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,500
from Holland, 100 shipping containers.

292
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,780
And then I went to the Steep Jobs Theater and the structural glass walls are from Italy

293
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,780
and Germany.

294
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:33,620
Then, after reading more stuff, I found out that the state-of-the-art electronic chip-making

295
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,420
machine comes from Holland.

296
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,380
And that goes back to their educational system.

297
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,740
They don't stick their nose up at the high-end skilled trades and look at it sort of like

298
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,060
a lesser form of intelligence.

299
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:52,380
When the kids get to about ninth grade, they can go university route or they can go tech

300
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,380
route.

301
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:58,740
They're going to emphasize high-end skilled trades where you're really using that visual

302
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:03,100
thinking for mechanical devices.

303
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,260
So I was trying to think through why this might be happening.

304
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:12,020
So let me offer some hypotheses to you and you tell me what you think about this.

305
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:19,600
So first of all, we have learned and you draw on Simon Baron Cohen's work in your book.

306
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,800
We have learned that there is a difference and we can try to map this on to verbal thinking

307
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,560
versus imagistic thinking.

308
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:36,560
Simon Baron Cohen talked about systemizing versus empathizing and he considers that something

309
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:42,160
akin to the continuum between autistic thinking and normal thinking.

310
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:49,240
So the autistic types are more systematizing and my suspicions are they're also the ones

311
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,520
who are more likely to think in images in the manner that you described.

312
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
Wait a minute.

313
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,400
Now we've got two kinds of thinking in images.

314
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,680
And there's a nice paper that just came out relatively recently, seeing and thinking in

315
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:08,800
pictures, a review of visual information processing that came out in 2018, I'd like to keep my

316
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,680
stuff up to date.

317
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:17,400
Now I think in photorealistic pictures where the more mathematical type of thinking thinks

318
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,480
in patterns.

319
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,960
See in your brain you've got circuits for what is something.

320
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,320
OK, so I see a dog and I go, yeah, that's a dog.

321
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,760
Or I've got some china ceramic cattle on my coffee table here.

322
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,200
OK, and I just look at the animals and name them.

323
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,640
Then the visual spatial is where is something?

324
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,560
Where are you located in space?

325
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,600
There are actually two different kinds of visualization.

326
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:54,240
And I have a whole chapter in visual thinking book about this and research to back this up.

327
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:01,400
Now the visual spatial type pattern thinking or sort of where is something in space, those

328
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,800
kids do well in math, so they're going to stem right.

329
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,360
But let me tell you what's going on out in the food processing plants.

330
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,400
The people I've worked with in the big steel shops now that a lot of us closed down, we

331
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,000
are paying the price now for taking out the shop classes on designed mechanically clever

332
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,600
equipment.

333
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,400
The people I've worked with in May, we never worked on boilers or refrigeration, we don't

334
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,320
understand that stuff.

335
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:31,440
That requires a lot more mathematical thinking or this load on the roof so the factory doesn't

336
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,080
fall down if we get two feet of snow.

337
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,400
You see then I have seen this division of engineering labor in every single meat company

338
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,400
I have worked with.

339
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,400
They're all the same.

340
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:47,760
So do you think that's a matter of like let's say something approximating focal depth?

341
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:56,600
So is it possible that the first kind of people that you talked about are dealing at the object

342
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
level itself?

343
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,600
So they're dealing say with a boiler or with a particular piece of equipment whereas the

344
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,400
other types are dealing with the relationship between pieces of equipment?

345
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
No, you don't think that's it?

346
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
No, I think it's just real simple.

347
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:15,160
You just see the objects and then after you work, you see an object visualizer gets better

348
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:20,000
and better at designing mechanical equipment, the more things you go out and see.

349
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
When I started working my designing cattle handling facilities, I went to every feed yard

350
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,880
in Arizona and I worked cattle and I go this kind of a design doesn't work, this worked

351
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,040
so then I took all the good bits and like recombined them.

352
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,240
It's bottom up thinking.

353
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,920
The more stuff I get exposed to, okay, whether it's cattle handling facility or maybe I'll

354
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,160
look at how water flows through something and then you watch how cattle move.

355
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:51,160
I'd like to look at drone footage and a lot of that resembles water flow and the visual

356
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,600
spatial, they see patterns.

357
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:03,160
It's actually very different and what we're losing is the object visualizer.

358
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:08,000
That person that can just, you see, I'm very aware of things like I go in an elevator now

359
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,400
that hasn't been serviced and it's scraping in the shaft, you better believe it.

360
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,080
I hear it and I go, they haven't serviced that elevator.

361
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:22,040
I was at a fancy hotel recently and the bell hop goes, oh, it skips that floor.

362
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,120
We have to get that floor on the way down.

363
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,360
Yeah, real nice hotel, major city.

364
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,120
Right, right.

365
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,520
Okay, so let me, I don't quite understand that distinction yet so I'm going to, I'm

366
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,080
going to push a little bit more on that.

367
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:42,520
So on the visual side, you have the visual spatial types, if I'm remembering this correctly,

368
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,680
and that's the category that you fall into.

369
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,640
And then you have people who are, what are they, higher up on the abstraction chain in

370
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,240
some sense, the ones who can think more mathematically?

371
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,840
No, but basically, object visualizers, I can tell you this from experience, we're good

372
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,360
at mechanical devices, art, photography.

373
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,920
I have talked to many, many photographers because I do a lot of interviews, find out

374
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,200
they're dyslexic, they're about flunked out of school, and fortunately somebody introduced

375
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,560
them to photography.

376
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,920
And the other thing that my kind of mind's good at is animals.

377
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,320
Then your visual spatial, mathematics, algebra, I can't do algebra.

378
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,480
There's nothing there to visualize.

379
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,080
Mathematics, calculus, I took a computer programming course when I was in college.

380
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,120
I couldn't do it, I had to drop it.

381
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,840
I was exposed to the same exact computer that Bill Gates had, and he could do it and I had

382
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,000
to drop the class.

383
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,040
These are the things that the more mathematical pattern thinking mind is good at.

384
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:45,440
And some of these really smart kids, they can just look at algebra formulas and just see

385
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,440
it.

386
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,400
They don't have to do it step by step, they just see it.

387
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,080
And that's how they think, and then the teachers try to make them do it step by step.

388
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,240
That gets the kids frustrated.

389
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,120
They don't think the same way.

390
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,400
And so my thinking is also associative, I tend to jump around.

391
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,600
But there's a logic to the association.

392
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,680
And I think the best way to illustrate that associative kind of thinking is give me a

393
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:14,560
single keyword, like I'm Google for images, and think of a creative keyword.

394
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:20,840
And I will tell you exactly how my mind associates and how my mind can get off the subject, but

395
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,760
there is a logic to the getting off of the subject.

396
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,360
So give me a keyword, a single keyword.

397
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,000
Okay, how about rows?

398
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,480
Okay, I'm seeing rows bushes that we had in our backyard when I was a child.

399
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,680
And we had a lot of thorns on them.

400
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,200
And we also like to dig around in the grass that was back there.

401
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:49,360
So now I'm seeing the grass behind our house, we used to go play in it and catch some insects

402
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,360
sometimes.

403
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,600
Okay, now you can see how it's jumping around.

404
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,160
I don't have that big a visual library of roses.

405
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:04,640
So then I tend to then go to something else.

406
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,720
But how about cows?

407
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,720
What?

408
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,720
Cows.

409
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,960
All right, now I'm seeing like 10 cow statues right here in front of me.

410
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,080
And so obviously those are coming up in my mind.

411
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,360
Just recently, I tend to bring up recent memories.

412
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:27,000
I visited with a black Angus bull, it was a pet, and he wasn't very happy with us because

413
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,920
we didn't bring him any carrots.

414
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:34,800
So my friend gave him one of those disgusting soy protein bars and he goes, not going to

415
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,800
eat that.

416
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,280
I wouldn't eat it, no matter how much we tried to feed it to him.

417
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:43,560
And he was annoyed because we didn't bring him any carrots.

418
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:49,400
Okay, now I've got the carrot word in my head.

419
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:54,640
And when I was in fourth grade, I used my singer Sohandi to sew green crepe paper so

420
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,360
students could be carrots.

421
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:01,360
And I made the green carrot tops out of green crepe paper.

422
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,720
So that's how I got the cattle to carrot.

423
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:11,200
So talking to you that way reminds me very much of what used to happen in my therapy

424
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,320
sessions when I was helping people interpret their dreams.

425
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:22,720
And so dreams have the same quality of thought that your thought had when you just put it

426
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,920
on display there.

427
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,560
So because the dream tends to be an intermingling.

428
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:33,560
So imagine there's a center category and the nature of the category is somewhat unclear.

429
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,360
Maybe that's partly what the dream is trying to puzzle out.

430
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:42,080
What you get is a web of associations, some of which are autobiographical, that are sort

431
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,760
of circulating around a main theme.

432
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,960
And partly what you do when you analyze a dream is you walk through all the associated

433
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,960
images.

434
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:56,840
You also ask the person to let their mind loose to generate more associations.

435
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:02,560
And then you try to use the associational web to triangulate on the central theme and

436
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,920
to haul out the gist.

437
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:09,000
And the gist of that array of images would be something like the interpretation of the

438
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
dream.

439
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,040
If you get it right, then it snaps into people.

440
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,640
They think, oh yes, that's definitely what that was about.

441
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:21,240
But the dream is attempting to put something together that has a central category of structure.

442
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:26,960
Well, now there also are sensory things because I have some balance issues.

443
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,400
So I often get dreams where I'm riding a bike down a hill that's super steep like that.

444
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,520
And I wish I wasn't doing that.

445
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,280
And I know that that has to do with the fact that I have balance issues.

446
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:41,920
I don't think it means anything, but I'm always up on some high place that I wish I wasn't

447
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,960
up on and I've got to try to walk down it.

448
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,280
And then I have other dreams where I can see it might have some meaning and other times

449
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,280
of where it doesn't.

450
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:58,320
But the other thing with my thinking, when I'm working on design work, I can control

451
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,560
the associations.

452
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,480
I can control them.

453
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,520
I've had before, there's now 3D simulations.

454
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:11,640
Okay, let's say the company that's building this plant wants to show off how the equipment

455
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,640
works.

456
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,920
They can do a 3D simulation showing how the equipment works.

457
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,320
I can remember sitting in a conference room when we were trying to discuss how to do some

458
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,440
conveyors.

459
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,680
And the other guys there are coming up with ideas for the conveyors and going, no, no,

460
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,320
if you do that, you're going to yank the rails out of the ceiling.

461
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,520
Oh, no, no, no, that won't work.

462
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:37,480
They were almost using my mind like a 3D CAD program that was animated.

463
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:42,480
And I could test run in my head on these different conveyors.

464
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,880
Men, is it time to stop mindless scrolling?

465
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,480
Time to finally gain that higher quality of life you know you're missing out on?

466
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,320
If this sounds familiar, then on January 9th, join thousands of men all over the world to

467
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,520
embark on a 90 day journey together in search of a better life.

468
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,440
It's called Exodus 90 and it was built to help men enjoy the freedom of becoming who

469
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,440
they were truly made to be.

470
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,360
Exodus 90 guides you in removing the attachments that are holding you back from a better life.

471
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,680
And it actually works.

472
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:17,000
Independent research shows that Exodus 90 men report considerable shifts after the first

473
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,440
90 days, including stronger satisfaction rates in their marriages, more meaningful prayer

474
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,680
lives, and dramatic decreases in time spent on their phones.

475
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:30,360
For the past seven years, Exodus has helped more than 60,000 men build a roadmap for living

476
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:35,320
with virtue in a culture that offers far too many paths to self-destruction.

477
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,280
Is it time for your Exodus?

478
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,200
We start January 9th.

479
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,880
Find resources to prepare for Exodus at Exodus90.com slash Jordan.

480
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:50,280
That's Exodus90.com slash Jordan.

481
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:55,400
So let's go back to the issue of, say, taking sharp class out of school.

482
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:00,040
So Baron Cohen talked about systematizers versus empathizers.

483
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:05,280
Yeah, but what Baron Cohen did, he left out the object visualizers.

484
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:10,160
He was looking more at the mathematical visualization pattern thinkers.

485
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:17,960
I agree with him about systematizing and verbal, but the object visualizer.

486
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,240
But he didn't differentiate.

487
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,960
He didn't differentiate the systematizers properly.

488
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,960
That should be more differentiated.

489
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,960
Yeah, he didn't.

490
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:29,080
The systematizers would have two categories, the object visualizer and the visual spatial.

491
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,600
And a big mistake in a lot of perceptual studies is that they're not differentiating them.

492
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:39,040
And some people, there's some verbal people in psychology that don't want to believe this

493
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,040
stuff exists.

494
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:46,480
Just while you were setting up the cameras, I downloaded six new abstracts that aren't

495
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,760
even in my book on this that show that they are different.

496
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,760
Right.

497
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,640
Got them right here on my lap.

498
00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:00,760
So Cohen also talks about gender differences in relationship to this continuum.

499
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,080
So we can break the continuum into two parts on the one end.

500
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:11,160
And it is the case that autism tends to be preferentially a male disorder, although there

501
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,800
are females as well.

502
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:18,120
But so that systematizing mode of thinking that you've differentiated into the two categories

503
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:22,800
also tends to be gender stereotype to some degree at a biological level.

504
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,560
I avoid that issue as controversial because right now, I'm interested in one thing at

505
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,960
the age of 75 of helping the students who think differently get into really good careers

506
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,920
where they can have satisfying lives.

507
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,360
And I avoid the controversial stuff.

508
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,280
Yeah, well, I'm not so much interested in the controversy.

509
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,160
I'm interested in trying to address the issue of why shop courses, for example, have been

510
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,800
taken out of schools.

511
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:57,120
Now we do know that schools are predominantly run by women, and women are more likely to

512
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,120
be empathizing.

513
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,480
No, I think it's a reason why they talk it out.

514
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,400
So I'm wondering if there's a gender issue going on there and a prejudice against a certain

515
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
way of thinking.

516
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,400
Okay.

517
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,400
What's that?

518
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,440
One of the reasons they took out the shop classes, they kind of just go, everybody's

519
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,640
going to go the university route and cost.

520
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,160
Good shop classes cost a lot of money.

521
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:23,440
Now people are starting to put shop classes back in, and you know what they're finding?

522
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,360
They can't find anybody that teach the shop classes.

523
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,760
I just heard about a brand new beautiful welding shop built here in Colorado at a community

524
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:36,480
college and they can't find somebody to teach it even after they dropped the university requirement.

525
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,480
And I can tell you right now, we need people that can do these things before the power

526
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,360
grid and the water systems fall apart.

527
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,720
I'll tell you that stuff I care about.

528
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,720
Right.

529
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,720
Right.

530
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,720
Right.

531
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,720
Yeah.

532
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,680
Well, do you think virtualization has also played a role in this?

533
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,200
I mean, the systematizing types.

534
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,200
You can't.

535
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,920
Some of the 3D drawings, I see a block.

536
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,240
And that's not going to fix some of the serious problems we've got with infrastructure right

537
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,440
now.

538
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,040
And you need both kinds of thinkers.

539
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,680
Like one of the things I've got in my book is where a bridge fell down in Minneapolis.

540
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,480
And the workers were complaining.

541
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,800
They were worried that when they were working on this bridge it was going to collapse.

542
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:24,160
Well, I looked up that bridge collapse and I saw all the twisted metal and I took one

543
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,880
look at that and I went, it's too light.

544
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,200
It's too cheap.

545
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,280
That was just from looking at the pictures.

546
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,320
And I found the engineering report on why that bridge fell down.

547
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,160
And they cheated on the gusset plates that hold the beams together and they were way

548
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,720
thinner than the spec.

549
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:49,320
But I had already looked at the pictures and said that bridge is too light, it's cheap

550
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:54,080
before I read any engineering report.

551
00:37:54,080 --> 00:38:02,120
So how was it in your life that you attained the practical knowledge necessary to facilitate

552
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,960
your thinking?

553
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,480
So we're talking about how kids who take in the vision.

554
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,480
I'll tell you how you do it.

555
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,480
It's real simple.

556
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,400
You got to get out and experience all kinds of stuff because the more information you

557
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,760
put in the database, the better you get.

558
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,160
And going back to teaching a computer how to diagnose melanoma, you had to give it like

559
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:24,160
a couple of thousand melanoma examples and a couple of thousand mosquito bites, infected

560
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,800
boils and everything else, examples.

561
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,480
In other words, the more, as I got older and I got more and more information in my database,

562
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:38,400
I could think better and better and better and I could make smaller categories of things.

563
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,240
Now a lot of the people that I worked with in construction that build equipment for me,

564
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,480
that's used in every large beef plant now in the US, some of them started and some of

565
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,920
them would definitely be autistic.

566
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,120
One of them started out working on cars, another one took a single welding class and now he's

567
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:00,800
selling mechanical equipment all over the world, started with a tiny shop that then

568
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,440
grew into a big shop.

569
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:10,640
And what's happening now is the little shops are not forming and that's why we're importing

570
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:15,400
all this equipment from Holland and Italy because when you look at their educational

571
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:21,920
system and I looked it up again recently online, Italy actually has three routes, university

572
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,040
route, tech route, mechanical and art route, you know like for their fashion industry and

573
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:32,960
the Holland and Netherlands you can go either university route or tech route and that's

574
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,680
why they're making the state-of-the-art chip making machine that we don't make.

575
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,680
Right.

576
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:43,360
And I'm not talking potato chips, I'm talking electronic chips.

577
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,520
Right.

578
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:50,480
I wonder if this is also a consequence of people increasingly moving away from farms.

579
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,280
No, because when you're on a farm you'd have to do a lot of hands-on stuff, you have to

580
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,360
do a lot of fence repair, you've got to take care of your own machinery and as you move

581
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,840
into the urban environment everything in some sense even in the real world is virtualized

582
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,480
because you can always call on other people to do the day-to-day things that you need

583
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,000
to keep the infrastructure in place for example.

584
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Well, I agree.

585
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,680
A lot of kids are growing up today totally removed from the practical.

586
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:23,160
And one of the things I talk about in the visual thinking book is I talked to a doctor

587
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:28,680
and he told me he had trouble training interns to sew up cuts because the interns had never

588
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,560
used scissors as a young child.

589
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:36,760
I had a student in my class that had never used a tape measure to measure anything.

590
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,120
And they're totally removed from the world of the practical where those kids that came

591
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:46,520
off the farms, yes, they had to figure out how to fix things, absolutely.

592
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:51,120
But I think what's happening now in the schools is things are getting so verbal and they're

593
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:57,400
going absolutely crazy on math requirements because I know people with 20 patents and

594
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:02,960
they could basically do sixth grade arithmetic that I could do because I can relate that

595
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,720
back to real things and things like.

596
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:15,440
Do you know of any research pertaining on how the people who visualize objects might

597
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,400
be assessed for their ability?

598
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,400
Yes.

599
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,080
And there's a whole chapter in here.

600
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:27,560
There's a whole chapter in here and I never can pronounce their names, Blank and Culver

601
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,480
and I never can say the names correctly.

602
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,700
But I have a whole list of references in there where the difference between the object visual

603
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,660
analyzer and the visual spatial is being assessed.

604
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,500
And there's a whole bunch of references on that.

605
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:49,340
Now I have to look these names up because I can't pronounce them correctly.

606
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:56,300
Let me find the reference list here for chapter two, okay, it's Blazhenkova.

607
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:03,220
I've got one, two, three references in here from Blazhenkova on types of creativity and

608
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:15,700
then the other big reference, I have lots of references, would be Kozhevnikov if she's

609
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:22,900
got trade-offs, object versus spatial visualization, reviewing the visual verbal dimension, evidence

610
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:29,300
for two types of visualizers, that's another paper, spatial versus object visualization,

611
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,620
a new characterization of visual cognitive style.

612
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:39,340
There's three papers right there from Kozhevnikov that are in my reference list and I've got

613
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:45,580
a lot of references where their actual tests were done.

614
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:50,340
When I go through the citation lists, I just went in and we're working on the children's

615
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:56,460
edition of the book right now and one of the copy editors had a query about a reference

616
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:03,260
and I had to look that up and then I decided to just type in object visualizer, visual

617
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:10,100
spatial into Google Scholar again and find the same old papers and then I found some

618
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:15,580
citations, it's kind of a cool paper here in the journal Cognition, it's an old paper

619
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:19,900
actually, visual objectability, a new dimension of nonverbal intelligence.

620
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:25,380
I know from working in factories, I spent 25 years in heavy construction and that is

621
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:30,820
something that I don't think many teachers have done that and seen how these guys think.

622
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:38,980
Big complicated Cargill plans, IBP plans which are now Tyson, Monfort plans, that company

623
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:44,900
is now JBS, figuring out complicated things with equipment.

624
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:51,740
It's a different type of intelligence and I think when I worked on the book with Betsy

625
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:58,660
Lerner, my super verbal co-writer who helped me organize things and she had someone come

626
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:03,860
in to fix a bunch of stuff in her house and after we had discussed this, Betsy was telling

627
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:08,900
me, well I watched how he figured out how to fix the stones on the chimney.

628
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:13,780
I had never really thought about it before but she watched how he did things and then

629
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:18,540
she started to understand there's a form of intelligence there that's absolutely not

630
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:19,660
verbal.

631
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:23,300
When she watched a person, she hired to fix stuff in her house.

632
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,780
Right, right.

633
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:30,180
Yeah, well you can imagine something and this did pop into my mind visually, can imagine

634
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:35,700
somebody who's trying to put together a stone chimney has to rotate stones to make sure

635
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:39,020
that they're going, like a Tetris game, that's a good way of thinking about it.

636
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:43,340
I was thinking then again, because I'm thinking in images now that we're talking, I was thinking

637
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:49,340
about my young grandson, he was only two years old, he had his Legos laid out in front

638
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:53,780
of him and when I was a kid, I played a lot with Legos and I played a fair bit with this

639
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:59,620
mechano set that was like a junior engineering set and it was certainly the case that working

640
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:06,260
with Legos was non-verbal because you're rotating shapes in space and having them fit into one

641
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:14,820
another towards some design end and that's a nice kind of hands-on learning and exposure

642
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:20,580
to different mechanical principles and so do you have recommendations for people who

643
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:29,340
want to help their children train their visual spatial and object visualization abilities?

644
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,020
Let's get them out building things.

645
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,580
The big mistake I see with a lot of kids is they're super good with Legos, they don't

646
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,260
think to introduce tools.

647
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:40,860
I was using tools by second grade, I was not using a saw, but I was using hammer, screwdriver

648
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:46,180
and pliers, I was taught how to use them safely, I've got another book of children's projects

649
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:51,780
called Calling All Minds where I describe bird kites that I spent hours with tinkering

650
00:45:51,780 --> 00:46:01,700
to get them to work, to agree with parachutes to get them to open up more easily, kids today

651
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:06,820
are totally separated in the world of physical things.

652
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:13,660
They're not getting out and observing stuff out in nature, this is part of the problem

653
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:20,740
and I just went to a veterinary school where the students are so far removed from practical

654
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:26,020
things that to give them dexterity skills and surgical skills they have these plastic

655
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:30,340
tote boxes and they put children's puzzles inside them and they've got to just reach

656
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:36,060
in and by feel put these children's puzzles together because when they were in kindergarten

657
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,700
they never did this.

658
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,500
Right, right, right.

659
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:44,460
Yeah, well my parents told me that when I was four my favorite toy was a screwdriver

660
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:49,180
and that I used to take all the cupboard doors off the cupboards in the kitchens.

661
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:53,980
And so I was introduced to tools at a very early age and that there's a real practical

662
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:59,100
utility in that too because now if I visualize a project in my house shelving or something

663
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:05,380
like that or any construction project of any sort, well I can visualize the array of tools

664
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:11,460
that's necessary to make that come about and then I have the tools at hand and I know how

665
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:20,460
to use them and that is a, well, it's also, I really find that kind of work calming and

666
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:21,620
engrossing.

667
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:26,660
We'll be back in one moment.

668
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:31,140
Next we wanted to give you a sneak peek at Jordan's new documentary, Logos in Literacy.

669
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:41,540
I was very much struck by how the translation of the Biblical writings jump-started the

670
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,740
development of literacy across the entire world.

671
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,740
Illiteracy was the norm.

672
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:52,460
The pastor's home was the first school and every morning it would begin with singing.

673
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:55,660
The Christian faith is a singing religion.

674
00:47:55,660 --> 00:48:00,580
Probably 80% of scripture memorization today exists only because of what is sung.

675
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,580
This is amazing.

676
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:08,140
Here we have a Gutenberg Bible printed on the press of Johann Gutenberg.

677
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:14,140
Science and religion are opposing forces in the world but historically that has not been

678
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,140
the case.

679
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,380
Now the book is available to everyone.

680
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:26,180
From Shakespeare to modern education and medicine and science to civilization itself.

681
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:31,900
It is the most influential book in all of history and hopefully people can walk away

682
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,780
with at least a sense of that.

683
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:42,340
Well the problem is is we got kids growing up today totally removed from the world of

684
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,540
the practical.

685
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:45,420
They don't use tools.

686
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,660
They don't use scissors.

687
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:51,660
I had a student in a class who had never used a ruler or tape measure to measure anything

688
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:54,220
ever.

689
00:48:54,220 --> 00:49:01,300
I think that's a problem because if you haven't done practical things then you don't understand

690
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,300
how to fix things.

691
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:05,620
Okay like two years ago they had the horrible mess where the power you know like a bunch

692
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:08,540
of different power stations froze.

693
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:13,900
Well I never heard so much abstract gobbledygook about that because the way I would work on

694
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:18,540
fixing it would be all right let's look at each power station what piece of equipment

695
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,940
actually froze.

696
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:24,820
I never saw anything written in the press that described okay what froze in this plant.

697
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:30,780
What froze in this plant because my inclination would be to kind of rank them on okay a turbine

698
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:34,780
haul that froze I can build a building over it that's an easy one you know a whole bunch

699
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:41,900
of gas wells froze that's gonna be like really difficult to fix but you see nothing's abstract

700
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:46,740
because okay if I'm gonna try to figure out how to fix it I don't really want to argue

701
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:52,060
who owns them I'm not interested in the politics I would just rank the power stations on expansiveness

702
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:58,060
and difficulty to winterize and say exactly what piece of equipment froze and you know

703
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:02,660
how I can find out you let me loosen there away from the managers I'll find the maintenance

704
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:04,540
shop they'll show me everything.

705
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:09,300
And I know enough about equipment that they can't BS me.

706
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:15,660
Right so maybe part of the advantage to that more visual form of processing is also its

707
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:22,660
association with that kind of practical particularization that's right that's right now on the other

708
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:27,460
hand I have no idea how to balance a power grid that's a job for the mathematicians you

709
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:34,940
see this is where we need to work together and in a complementary factor in a complementary

710
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:39,380
way and I tell people in big corporations that I've done a lot of talks for businesses

711
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:48,540
your first step is that you've got to recognize different kinds of thinking exists and let's

712
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:53,500
take another example recently I visited two really nice dairies up in Quebec Canada that

713
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:58,300
have the robotic milking machines where the cow can go in she decides one she wants to

714
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:04,540
get milk and get fed and on both dairies it actually made some good mechanical modifications

715
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:10,300
on that equipment which the equipment company finally adopted but one of the dairy producers

716
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:16,380
said to me I stop at the computer stuff I don't mess with the program that's somebody else's

717
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:22,100
job to work on the software but the mechanical parts of the device they figured out ways

718
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:29,220
to improve it yeah it's like a it's like a hierarchy man you can imagine a hierarchy

719
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:35,460
of generalization with the highest resolution lowest level being the particulars of a given

720
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:42,580
machine then you can imagine people but specialized to operate at different levels of the hierarchy

721
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:47,500
maybe the verbal types are operating at the high well that's right they are but they lose

722
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:51,660
that particularization that's right that's basically right because the verbalizer tends

723
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:56,620
to overgeneralize one of the papers that are reviewed in my book on visual thinking was

724
00:51:56,620 --> 00:52:03,220
an interesting study where on high school students that came life for school specializing

725
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:07,900
in the arts another school specializing in the sciences and another one especially in

726
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:13,380
the humanities which would be more verbal on those teams of students and their assignment

727
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:20,380
was to create a new planet so the art students heavily visualizing they made a planet with

728
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:26,220
crystals on it another one made a skyscraper planet and then the more mathematical science

729
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:33,420
students just painted a round made a round ball and described the gravity and the atmosphere

730
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:38,060
you know kind of boring pictures and the verbal thinkers started write it down and then they

731
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:43,420
go oh wait a minute we're supposed to draw the planet so they made kind of splotchy stuff on it

732
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:49,900
but the thing that was interesting is that the art minds more my kind of mind and the mathematical

733
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:57,020
minds they had big planning sessions on how to design their planet where the verbal thinkers

734
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:01,580
on they didn't do any planning you see this is the problem the verbal thinker would get big

735
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:08,620
broad concepts or something we need to do right but how do you actually implement those concepts

736
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:14,700
yeah right there's no detail there now in food safety we have a thing that I really like it's

737
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:21,100
called hazard analysis critical control points so let's say I'm out there in a sea of of things

738
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:27,180
I can do well I can't do all that stuff you see now the critical control point let's say in food

739
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:35,180
safety in a food factory I can't measure microbes and bacteria on everything in that plant I have

740
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:42,300
to pick out the places where I'm most likely to have contamination that would be the critical

741
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:49,900
control points and one of them is doorknobs yeah that's why some places food factories have

742
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:57,260
automatic doors because that gets rid of touching the door yeah well one of one of the things that

743
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:04,700
I always found a relief in working with engineers is that they were good and I can see it in the

744
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:10,860
terms that you're describing they were very good at rank ordering practical priorities right and

745
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:17,580
that that seems to be part of this particularization so I have this company it's a software company

746
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:24,700
that sells personality tests and and writing programs for people to help them plan their lives

747
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:30,460
and my business partners and engineer and although he's also very intelligent verbally he's more

748
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:38,060
intelligent non-verbally and he knows the systems right from the from the code upward at every level

749
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:43,580
of the machine instantiation and so the huge advantage to that is that if anything ever goes

750
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:48,940
wrong he knows exactly what goes wrong and he knows exactly how to fix it it's particularized

751
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:54,620
down to the point where that makes action possible eh and that's part of the problem with the with

752
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:59,900
the verbal abstraction is that it makes sense conceptually but that doesn't mean that it's

753
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:04,540
detailed to the point where it's actually implementable and then it it's like a pseudo knowledge

754
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:11,020
right because it sounds like you've got the picture right but when you actually try to

755
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:16,140
implement it you find out that that that it's really a hollow a hollow shell of conceptualization

756
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:21,740
well I kind of look at like this is why when I learned about the food safety concept of

757
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:26,300
hazard analysis critical control points or let's just call it critical control points

758
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:33,260
so I've got a big sea of stuff out there what's the really important thing okay now I I only think

759
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:39,980
in specific examples so let's take frozen Texas power stations the critical control

760
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:47,740
point is and I want it like in two sentences what great piece of equipment froze and then

761
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:53,420
you can very easily figure out the ones that'll be easy to winterize and I've actually talked to

762
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:59,820
somebody who installs gas wells and I only cost $5,000 to winterize a well when you build it

763
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:05,500
to retrofits a complete mess he also said you have to have someone who knows how to turn the

764
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:12,540
valves he said that's me right I call him the guy in the pickup and that person in that pickup

765
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:19,180
truck is not getting enough credit he knows how to turn those valves right yeah so if you

766
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:25,100
conceptualize that verbally you end up saying something like a bad winter storm took out the

767
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:31,340
Texas power grid and that sort of sounds like you've said something but it's nothing like saying

768
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:38,220
well the grid is made out of 200 different uh like industrial assemblies each of those

769
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:43,020
is made up of a variety of parts that's differentially susceptible to winter all right well that's

770
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:49,020
still gobbledygook because first of all they wouldn't have 200 separate power stations you know it's

771
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:58,380
more like 10 something like that and and I would just let I listen well write down the name of the

772
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:02,780
station because I don't really care who owns it and what we used to do with meat packing plants when

773
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:08,060
we were doing welfare audits is we'd always call them by their town names because you're auditing

774
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:13,740
that particular plant next I will this power station at a frozen turbine hall that's an easy one to

775
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:20,220
fix on then there was a coal fire that froze well as they freeze up the where you have a cold

776
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:28,940
bump sand that's probably really easy to fix and if you know 50 gas wells froze up the feet of plant

777
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:36,060
that's going to be a mess to fix on but you see as I talk about these things I see it and I happen

778
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:41,100
to know what some of the equipment looks like you see that also makes me a better troubleshooter

779
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:46,780
you know if I know what stuff looks like you see this is where you've got to put things in my database

780
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:54,380
but I but I worked 25 years out in factories on heavy construction stuff so I know what a lot

781
00:57:54,380 --> 00:58:00,700
of stuff looks like right so so it means in some sense that to solve the problem is you take the

782
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:07,260
verbal representation so the verbal representation is a storm took out the texas power grid and then

783
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:12,860
you say well there's 10 key components to that's okay our grid so that differentiates that and then

784
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:21,020
you say in each of the 10 systems there are critically vulnerable points that are specifically

785
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:25,820
sensitive to cold weather we need to differentiate and find out what those key ones are then we

786
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:30,620
have to differentiate that further you see now okay now when I first started my work there was no

787
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:36,060
Google Earth well the first thing I do probably Google Earth and Street View the power stations

788
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:42,540
and the other thing I've learned if I want to get accurate information I don't you don't talk to the

789
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:49,020
managers you got to get down in the shop and and then the shop guys have to be not worried about

790
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:54,300
getting fired that's another right right nasty issue that I'm going to have to deal with

791
00:58:55,740 --> 00:59:00,780
but you know let's say I get three shop guys together and we have okay my industry say when

792
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:05,100
we get rid of all the suits you know that's going to be the managers and the verbal thinkers

793
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:08,860
they won't talk in front of suits they're afraid they're going to lose their jobs

794
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:13,980
you know and this is something I know from all the years I've worked in this stuff

795
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:19,420
and then they'll take you out there and show you what froze and then oh there's creative things I've

796
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:24,860
talked to a guy I worked in a power plant and there was this one sensor very important electronic

797
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:32,060
sensor and it gets cold and when it got cold he put plastic garbage bags over it and I'm going

798
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:37,260
right well I think we need to have something a little more permanent to keep that sensor warm

799
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:45,500
than black plastic garbage bags that's what I told him yeah so so that that issue that the the guys

800
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:51,180
with the hands-on knowledge have to worry about being fired is interesting too because it seems

801
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:57,500
like so they have this extremely detailed knowledge that's practical about how these systems operate

802
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:03,020
and what happens is if they bring that knowledge up the abstraction hierarchy what they're doing

803
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:08,460
in some sense is is pointing out the manner in which their superiors their hypothetical

804
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:17,580
well that's the problem and a very big problem I've had is um I they're they're worried about

805
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:25,660
losing their jobs yeah and and but you really want to solve the problem they need to be able to

806
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:30,780
talk to you freely because they're the ones that tell you exactly what froze

807
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:39,100
right well the question is why would their attempts to bring their practical reality to bear

808
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:45,180
as they move information up the information hierarchy why would that threaten people to the

809
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:52,380
point where they would be intimidated in relationship to their job I mean why is there this gap the

810
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:57,100
psychological gap between the practical and the abstract I mean you'd think that the managers

811
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:02,380
would be calling on these people all the time you got to drag those suits out of the office too

812
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:10,140
just when things are working normally and so they get a better understanding of what the

813
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:16,220
practical people are doing now my animal welfare work on one of the things where I made some of

814
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:20,780
the biggest difference in animal welfare work is auditing programs I helped develop with McDonald's

815
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:28,620
Wendy's and Burger King back over 20 years ago and in this situation we were taking vice president

816
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:35,420
level managers out to the plant and they'd have these undercover boss moments just like that show

817
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:41,020
I'll never forget the day when the McDonald's vice president saw a half-dead dairy cow go into

818
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:47,980
their product and he goes yeah we got some things here we have to fix you see before it was all an

819
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:54,060
abstraction spreadsheets numbers okay animal welfare give it to lawyers give it to the public

820
01:01:54,060 --> 01:02:00,540
relations department but when they came out of the office and they saw something bad now it was real

821
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:07,340
now they had to act it was no longer abstract anymore there seems to be a kind of pride in that

822
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:12,540
abstraction in some sense I mean I've also noticed that highly intellectual people and maybe those

823
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:18,060
are ones who think primarily in words tend to be rather dismissive of the intelligence of more

824
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:24,300
practical people like working people and that's I come from a working class environment so although

825
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:29,420
I've hung around verbal people most of my life so I can see that dichotomy do you have any sense of

826
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:38,860
why it is that the more abstract thinkers are have a well because they used to say okay the kids

827
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:43,900
that are like failing in high school stupid kids go and shop well I can tell you right now

828
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:49,420
right exactly I worked big metal fabrication companies owned by these so-called stupid people

829
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:53,340
and what they they were inventing equipment they had 20 patents and they were very proud of their

830
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:59,820
patents and one of them made posters out of them put them up all over his place it's a different

831
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:08,460
kind of intelligence and and it's not you know there's things they can do that the verbal thinkers

832
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:13,820
can't do and what I what I'm really interested in is we need all the different kinds of minds

833
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:19,900
because one of the problems with my kind of thinker since I'm associative is the point in a company

834
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:24,940
let's say I had a metal fabrication shop I'd have to hire a verbal thinker just to run the business

835
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:31,260
the payroll ordering materials things all of that part of it do you think it's a competition

836
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:36,780
do you think it's a competition for status between different forms of neurodiversity

837
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:42,860
I mean if I can claim that my intelligence is paramount that that increases my social status

838
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:47,980
in some sense right you can imagine there's a competition for that broadly going on in society

839
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:54,940
what I have found is when you got the verbal thinkers out in the field their eyes got opened

840
01:03:56,940 --> 01:04:03,180
that the important thing is you got to drag the suits out of the office I've done a whole lot of

841
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:09,420
that and let me tell you they changed okay I've done a lot of work on supply chain management

842
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:15,180
and when there's supply chain disasters like a factory burning up and a clothing industry

843
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:21,100
disgusting industry they need to clean up a lot of stuff and a factory burns up a hundred people

844
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:29,500
selling bluejanes well the suits didn't get out of the office and see what was going on in these

845
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:35,500
factories until there was a disaster the one they should have been preventing a disaster like that

846
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:41,740
right well yeah so once you build up hierarchical organizations it's very easy for the people who

847
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:47,500
are operating near the top of the abstraction chain not to pay attention to the details and

848
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:51,340
hopefully the details are working out so well that you don't have to pay attention to them I mean

849
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:56,220
that's in some sense the point of building a hierarchical organization but but what you need to

850
01:04:56,220 --> 01:05:02,380
do obviously the manager can't be you know doing every job out there in a plant but they need to

851
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:08,540
have enough contact with the field and I'm going to use the field be like the factory floor farming

852
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:16,380
you know waterworks any of these kind of things so they they understand the difference

853
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:21,340
there can be things bad going on but I tell business managers and I've talked to many big

854
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:29,100
corporations computer companies steel companies on pharmaceutical companies that the first step is

855
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:36,060
realizing that different kinds of thinking exist and that they can work together in complementary

856
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:43,260
ways and you actually need the whole team you need the whole team because we're kind of

857
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:48,700
disorganized and associational and I'm going to need a verbal thinker if I got a really big

858
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:57,500
business to you know keep the business going so what do you think what do you think of the

859
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:05,180
suppositions and you talk about them a bit in your book that the visual versus verbal modes of

860
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:10,540
cognition map to some degree on to hemispheric specialization well that the right is more

861
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:15,340
oriented towards your kind the right hemisphere is more oriented broadly speaking towards

862
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:21,020
speaking broadly so it dominates your mind yeah but broadly speaking that's true you know

863
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:26,700
they're accept they're exceptions to some of that that stuff but I'm the thing that I want to talk

864
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:35,180
about is is right now I'm seeing too many kids that are dyslexic autistic or whatever I'm

865
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:42,380
ending up playing video games on a disability check when they could be photographers I got

866
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:49,900
four person crew here right now doing this filming and that's an interesting career

867
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:56,060
or they could be designing mechanical equipment and they never get an opportunity to do photography

868
01:06:56,060 --> 01:07:01,020
art or mechanical equipment because it kind of looked at these stupid kids

869
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:08,300
right right okay so there's a privileging of this semantic and that's partly because it's

870
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:14,220
cheaper it's easier it's detached from the world in some sense how do you think we should redesign

871
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:19,820
schools for say kindergarten kids and elementary kids in some practical way you tend to think

872
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:26,060
practically what do you what do you think would be a good start well like in the 50s when I went

873
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:31,180
to school we had all kinds of craft projects I was learning to use little blunt scissors probably

874
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:36,060
in first grade I'd be putting all the hands-on classes back into schools and that's going to

875
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:44,780
include theater music cooking sewing when I went to elementary school I loved art sewing and wood

876
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:50,540
working and if I hadn't had those classes I would have hated elementary school and I loved sewing

877
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:55,900
and I'm what I was in fourth grade I had a singer sew handy a toy sewing machine that

878
01:07:55,900 --> 01:08:00,380
actually sewed and it was one of my favorite things because I could make things with it

879
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:08,460
kids are not doing enough of that kind of stuff today right okay so there's a return to the there's

880
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:13,340
there's a need for a return to the practical on in some sense on both sides of the gender

881
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:20,460
everybody on every way with and I would now I went when I was doing a book signing for visual

882
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:28,460
thinking I went to on a physics lab in Harvard this room's labeled physics lab and they had all

883
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:33,260
kinds of 3d printers on there but they also had a sewing machine and they also had a station for

884
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:39,820
crocheting this is the building labeled engineering department at Harvard maybe they're realizing

885
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:43,660
they've got to get them doing some hands-on things this is when I did the book signing

886
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:49,180
for this it was part of the book tour the other thing I've noticed I stayed I got into some

887
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:57,180
interesting places I stayed at this hotel where where they is in Evansville Illinois where they had

888
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:04,780
textbooks in the rooms from the 1930s I wish I'd had more time to look at it and I pulled out an

889
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:12,380
electrical engineering book and it had a lot of math in it but it was much more applied they'd

890
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:16,700
say well this is how this is the generator works this is the math that goes well but it would

891
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:25,820
describe how the generator actually worked it was much more applied and I now the physiology book

892
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:31,260
that I had in the 70s you know explain how the kidney works how the heart works and then explain

893
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:35,740
the chemistry now I look at a physiology book and it's much more verbal a lot more math and

894
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:41,820
chemistry but how does the kidney actually work I still have my old Duke's physiology of domestic

895
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:48,460
animals from 1970 and I want to go back and compare that to the Duke's physiology now and

896
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:57,260
and it's like we're taking the practical out I just got an email yesterday from the UK that they

897
01:09:57,260 --> 01:10:02,460
wanted to take a technology and design course out of a high school you see I think this what's

898
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:08,140
happening now is mathematics is totally taking over yes we need mathematics because my kind of

899
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:13,820
mind is not going to touch boilers and refrigeration in that food processing plant that's a job for

900
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:21,500
the mathematicians but what we're losing is the object visualizer right right right yeah well I

901
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:28,300
wonder I wonder too if part of this is the fact that you know for a long time in our society

902
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:34,060
a lot of this practical machinery just worked and so we could afford to ignore it in some

903
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:40,060
abstract sense right because our cars worked and our power grids worked and we could take all of

904
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:44,460
this low-level infrastructure for granted now that meant there were a lot of people on the shop

905
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:49,980
floors who were busily working making sure it worked but it did mean that we had the luxury to

906
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:55,820
engage in abstract specialization and maybe we could fall prey to the psychological tendency

907
01:10:55,820 --> 01:11:02,540
to just dismiss all that well you see when they first started about 20 years ago is when they

908
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:08,460
started taking shop classes out of the schools well you can get away with that for a while

909
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:16,700
and then the people I worked with on gray now are retiring they're retiring out and they're not

910
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:22,140
getting replaced that's happening with elevator and escalator mechanics that's happening with airplane

911
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:28,140
mechanics and I'm seeing that more and more and more and more as I travel these are free things

912
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:37,420
that I see all the time and they are getting gray right right so yeah the retirement problem's going

913
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:43,500
to be the retirement although there's when it comes to industry there's two gigantic mistakes

914
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:51,100
that were made shutting down in-house engineering shops 20 years ago we had a huge metalworking

915
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:56,860
shop called the Montfort fab shop and it was part of the engineering of a company called Montfort so

916
01:11:56,860 --> 01:12:03,580
no longer exists now well that's been shut down and then at the same time we took out shop classes

917
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:09,820
now in the short run it was cheaper for these companies to just farm out engineering work they

918
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:17,100
need to do in their plant yeah that works fine until the shops retire out and now what's happened

919
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:20,860
like I can't go in the name give you the name of the company but I have a client right now

920
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:28,140
where the one shop that's left is ripping people off at five times the price and that's happening

921
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:37,340
right right do you see any positive consequences of computer technology for object visualizers

922
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:42,300
and for the for the people who are working more in the visual spatial end of things well it's

923
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:48,860
definitely useful to you know like the visualization and stuff you can do on computers but that doesn't

924
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:56,620
replace real things let me tell you power grid I lay awake at night about that and that's so fragile

925
01:12:56,620 --> 01:13:01,660
that I'm not I'm not going to go into any detail because it's too fragile and I'm not going to

926
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:07,740
discuss the things that I visualize and lay awake at night about the power grid because it's just

927
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:15,900
okay um okay I'm curious about that why not discuss them because I don't want to give I don't want to

928
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:21,740
give people that have bad intentions any information on how to hurt the power grid okay okay okay I see

929
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:28,620
I see that is the reason right because it's very easy so when you and I don't want to give out any

930
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:33,580
information that would help somebody damage the power grid so I don't discuss the details here

931
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:40,860
but I'm seeing them right now right right right yeah well that's part of that ability to think about

932
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:45,660
critical points of failure well there's I know exactly I'm engineering mind I know where the

933
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:52,620
critical points of failure are and I'm not going to discuss them right right so we can all be thankful

934
01:13:52,620 --> 01:14:00,220
that you're not a terrorist yeah I'll be thankful I'm not a criminal yes exactly exactly yeah well

935
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:07,580
I've always often been afraid when thinking along the same lines that you're describing of just exactly

936
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:12,540
how fragile things are in that regard and how much someone with a good imagination how much

937
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:17,900
damage they could do if they targeted things properly it is really quite frightening to apprehend

938
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:23,180
well that's why there's certain things about the power grid I am not going to discuss and I'm seeing

939
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:29,820
three big fat critical control points right now I'm seeing them in my mind and they make me cringe

940
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:36,940
right so so could we talk a little bit about the specifics of your work I remember one of the

941
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:42,860
stories you told at this Tucson conference was about you talked about cows that they would do

942
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:47,580
such things as go into a field and look at if you look left a briefcase on the field for example

943
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:53,260
the cows would eventually come and look at it yeah that's right a cow's in a in a line might be

944
01:14:53,260 --> 01:15:00,780
stopped by something like a coke bottle in their path and so you used your ability to think like

945
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:07,340
animals to design systems for animal handling that were much more humane so could you walk us

946
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:14,060
through that a little bit well the first work I did with cattle was in the 70s in Arizona I

947
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:18,780
when I didn't even know that I had was a visual thinker and other people were not a visual thinker

948
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:23,340
and I noticed that if there was a coat hung on the fence the cattle would stop

949
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:30,300
on if there was a shadow or reflection off a vehicle so I got down in the shoots to see what

950
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:36,620
they were seeing and I would take pictures down inside the shoot and people thought that was kind

951
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:44,620
of crazy but now I'm like right just recently did start up at a really big plant and at 10 o'clock

952
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:49,740
in the morning everything was working fine and then at three o'clock in the afternoon a big shadow

953
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:55,420
appeared I called the spider monster and it was just a shadow and these cattle decided they weren't

954
01:15:55,420 --> 01:16:01,180
going to walk over that so they'll have to build a roof over the facility so that the cattle can't

955
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:07,340
see the spider monster on the other thing I'm I show I show people how to do is watch your lead

956
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:12,780
animal your lead animal will come up and stop and look at the thing they don't like the same plant

957
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:19,020
on the night shift okay the shadow monster wouldn't be there they either the guy calls me and he goes

958
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:24,940
they go halfway up the shoot and stop all right what do I do I said now bring up a nice calm bunch

959
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:30,460
of cattle watch your leader really carefully he'll look right at the thing he doesn't like

960
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:37,580
and there's an LED light on the corner of a building and they took that down and then everything

961
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:45,260
worked fine how do you identify the leader well there's always a leader when when all right let's

962
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:52,060
say I take a 20 head of cattle out of a pan there's a lead animal that walks out first usually one

963
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:57,580
of the more bold animals not the dominant animal the dominant animal that pushes the others away

964
01:16:57,580 --> 01:17:02,060
from the feed trough he's in the middle of the herd or she's in the middle of the herd but the

965
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:07,260
leader will come out of the pen first and the other cattle follow and it's just the first animal in

966
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:11,500
the group it's a leader it's that simple you see as we're talking about that I'm seeing it

967
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:19,820
okay so so is that leader stable across instances of leadership and is that associated with this

968
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:26,620
ability to find what's anomalous and to deal with well in cattle that have lived together for a while

969
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:33,500
tend to stay in the same order you know years ago when your tags came out that were sequentially

970
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:37,900
numbered in other words you could just buy a package of ear tags labeled one through 200

971
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:44,220
and they put them on their cattle and one of the things that surprised ranchers when maybe 200

972
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:49,420
cattle came back the following year to go through the shoots to get vaccinated and they were coming

973
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:58,780
to in almost the same order now that's a group of cattle that live together okay is there something

974
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:03,740
okay so you made the observation that the lead animal will stop and look at the thing that he

975
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:10,300
doesn't like and so are the other animals and but it also that lead animal wasn't the physically

976
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:15,260
dominant animal he's got some other characteristics the animal it's dominant at the pushing others

977
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:20,780
away from the water trough or the feed trough but the but once the lead animal walks the other

978
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:25,740
cattle usually will follow same thing was shaped the other animals will usually follow right so you

979
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:31,900
remove the distractions that the lead animals reacting to and and at this particular plant

980
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:35,900
we had two things we had to get rid of we had to get rid of the shadow the spider monster shadow

981
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:39,820
and we had to get rid of an led light that was on the corner of a building

982
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:49,100
so do you have any sense on of why the other animals come to rely on the lead animal like what's

983
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:54,700
the lead animal being selected for or is it just a first mover well the leader of this lead animal

984
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:59,900
you see there's different levels of fear in animals genetically some animals are more bold

985
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:07,420
other animals are more shy or you can call those high and low fear and the animal that's more bold

986
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:17,260
is more likely to be the leader than the animal that's more anxious and and and you know if you

987
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:21,420
down with a bunch of cattle that have lived together all the time you know that there'll be

988
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:26,140
certain animals that tend to be the leaders and then you've got the big one with the giant horns

989
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:30,140
and she shoves everybody else away from the feed trough there's something that's very profound

990
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:35,580
about that because you're laying out the fact that it isn't the dominant animal that leads no

991
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:41,100
and that it's the animal that's exploratory and that's somewhat willing to take risks that

992
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:47,660
that's right but also absolutely also that the that the lead animal will spot anomaly right like

993
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:53,500
the spider monster that you're describing and so it's not like they're they're so bold that

994
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:59,100
they're completely without fear they're still acting cautiously in some sense all right so you

995
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:03,500
can walk the lead animal down a chute and you can see what it's going to see and you can actually

996
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:07,420
do that because you go down there and do it but you also think that way you've got to bring your

997
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:12,380
cat up really calmly to see because if you bring him up at a run then the leader just turns back

998
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:17,260
and you don't know what it's reacting to oh yeah i said to him now bring him up nice and calm watch

999
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:22,380
the leader come up the chute and when he stops he'll look right at the thing he doesn't like and

1000
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:27,580
he looked at the led light on the corner of the building then they texted me a picture of it and

1001
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:35,820
they got rid of that and that fixed the problem now have you have you have you developed some sort of

1002
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:42,940
picture of the class of things that stop cats yes yes i have the spider mode okay so tell me what

1003
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:48,940
sort of thing i have him to stop cattle i have pictures i have checklists of things to look for

1004
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:56,700
reflections on water at this particular plant there was a gate handle a gate handle that jiggled

1005
01:20:56,700 --> 01:21:01,980
and it was right by the chute entrance i said that needs to be fixed so this gate handle doesn't

1006
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:10,140
vibrate so what's common do you what's common about the things that stop cattle in their tracks

1007
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:15,340
or or can you extract out well let's look at let's look at cattle's a prey species animal

1008
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:22,940
so you're looking for things that might be a danger some little little bits of rapid movement set

1009
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:30,860
them off and and something that's sort of like shouldn't be there like you can put a white plastic

1010
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:34,380
bottle in the entrance of the chute now about shut a meat plant down

1011
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:42,460
i they'll just keep turning back away from it turning back away from it right so they're looking

1012
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:47,100
for something that doesn't fit the environmental pattern and that's probably doing something like

1013
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:52,540
activating predator detection well that's right it's like that you know they they're looking for

1014
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:58,700
stuff that you know a movement in the bushes maybe that's a mountain lion or a wolf some

1015
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:03,740
little movement in the bushes the other thing about new experiences if you take something

1016
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:09,180
like camera equipment cattle love camera equipment you put an expensive camera in the middle of the

1017
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:15,340
pasture they will come up and knock it over and lick it to death that's what they will do

1018
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:22,460
see things that are novel are attractive when the animal can voluntarily approach and scary if

1019
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:29,420
you suddenly shove it in their face you suddenly shove it in their face then it's scary right and

1020
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:35,820
so the best way that's a introduce new things to cattle is to let them voluntarily approach it

1021
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:40,220
i don't know how many times people say to me my horse was fine at home he went crazy at the show

1022
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:46,540
well you've got a lot of novel stuff they're like flags for example so you better get your horse used

1023
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:51,020
to flags before you go there and the best way to get them used to flags would be to decorate the

1024
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:57,580
pasture with flags and let your animal walk up and voluntarily approach them right right well you

1025
01:22:57,580 --> 01:23:01,660
know that's exactly what you do in psychotherapy when you're trying to help people overcome

1026
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:06,620
aphobia right so if someone's afraid of an elevator and won't get in it that often happens

1027
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:15,020
with agoraphobia what you do is you say to them okay um let's start by imagining elevators so that's

1028
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:20,060
going to make you a bit nervous but imagine an elevator at some distance that doesn't make you

1029
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:27,180
uncomfortable okay okay and then you say okay well now you've done that see if you can move yourself

1030
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:33,100
in your mind closer to the elevator door and then you keep doing that but it has to be voluntary

1031
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:38,060
it's 100% absolutely necessary for it to be okay so maybe you run them through this

1032
01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:43,340
imaginal exposure therapy and then you say okay for our next session what we're going to do is

1033
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:46,620
we're going to go out in the hallway you know that elevator you wouldn't take we're going to go out

1034
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:51,420
in the hallway we're going to stand 200 feet away from the elevator and you're just going to look at

1035
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:57,500
it if you can't and so they'll do that has to be voluntary and then you can get them 150 feet away

1036
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:03,260
and 100 feet away and soon they'll be right up to the elevator door I was very anxious

1037
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:10,620
I you know my 20s and I got terrified of airplanes because I was an extremely scary

1038
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:15,420
emergency landing when I was a senior in high school they put the slides down and the whole thing

1039
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:21,740
very very scary and one of the ways I got over that is I had to make aviation interesting

1040
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:28,140
and when I got the ride in the cockpit of a plane flying on Holstein Hefers to Puerto Rico

1041
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:36,620
that made it interesting you make something scary interesting because I know another thing they do

1042
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:41,660
on the elevator phobias is they show them how the safety mechanisms work that the elevator is not

1043
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:48,700
going to fall down the shaft yeah well you you you know you even compel that interest to some

1044
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:55,340
degree so for example one once you get a phobic person inside an elevator what they'll tend to do

1045
01:24:55,340 --> 01:25:01,660
is look at their feet and so you say to them look quit looking at your feet look at each corner of

1046
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:08,460
the elevator look at all the numbers look at the display panel like you have to facilitate their

1047
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:14,220
voluntary visual exploration okay and to some degree what you're doing is you're calling out

1048
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:19,420
their interest to say attend to all of these things as if they're interesting and then that's

1049
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:24,220
how they familiarize themselves with the elevator and they also note that well they're in there

1050
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:28,620
because you have to look at the elevator to know you're in an elevator right literally you have to

1051
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:33,420
move your eyes and point at all the different parts of the elevator and the more that you can help

1052
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:39,980
people do that at a high level of detailed resolution voluntarily the more likely they are not not

1053
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:44,940
only to become less afraid of the elevator is that that actually isn't what happens is you actually

1054
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:50,700
train them in a form of exploratory bravery because what you teach them is that if they use

1055
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:56,780
their eyes voluntarily to scan what they're afraid of they'll become braver and then that generalizes

1056
01:25:56,780 --> 01:26:03,180
to all sorts of other instances too so if you train someone to be less afraid of an elevator

1057
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:08,860
they're much less afraid of other things as well well that's right and the thing that we're saying

1058
01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:14,220
I'm seeing now in dogs you know we have very strict lease laws here and there's more problems with

1059
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:18,700
dogs being afraid of the veterinarian because they haven't been out experiencing enough stuff

1060
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:24,220
like strange people touching them for example just going to lots of different places you know this is

1061
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:30,380
the reason why when they train service dog puppies you take them everywhere so that there's almost

1062
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:37,980
nothing that will frighten them yes yeah well that that that's the same argument you were making

1063
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:42,140
earlier about the fact that to train people practically we have to put them in a lot of

1064
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:47,420
different practical hands-on situations and so that they can generalize across all those instances

1065
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:53,740
and so experience that's too narrow is too is too restrictive well when I get worried that

1066
01:26:53,740 --> 01:27:00,620
we're going to have people making policy on all kinds of important stuff on when they're so far

1067
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:06,460
removed from the world of the practical you see we need to have both because all the problem with

1068
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:12,780
us practical people is we're not organized enough that's where just about every tech company

1069
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:18,540
has to hire a suit eventually just to keep the company organized somebody's got to pay the payroll

1070
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:24,540
somebody's got to pay the taxes somebody has to make sure the rent is paid you know if they need

1071
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:31,180
more office space then they've got to go out and go shopping for office space you know they there's

1072
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:38,220
uh and we really do need all the different kinds of minds well when I look at the ideological

1073
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:43,980
solutions that are being put forward to the world's problems continually I do wonder the same thing

1074
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:50,860
you're wondering about which is is this empty ideological representation a consequence of

1075
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:54,940
the fact that the people who are doing this have no practical experience at all it's like

1076
01:27:54,940 --> 01:28:00,460
they're not thinking at the level of detail well I think that it's a problem because when I worked

1077
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:05,820
originally this is over 20 years ago with McDonald's Burger King and Wendy's and they took the top

1078
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:11,980
managers out into the field and implemented the auditing program it was interesting to see how the

1079
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:18,940
animal welfare uh issue went from an abstraction give it to legal give it to public relations

1080
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:24,940
to something real that they really needed to address you know half-dead animals going into your

1081
01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:31,020
products not okay right right right uh broken stunning equipment is totally terrible and not

1082
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:38,620
okay and that's mainly a management problem and failure to do maintenance and and I and and and

1083
01:28:38,620 --> 01:28:44,860
and when I worked on that 1999 I got five journal articles published on this and I saw more change

1084
01:28:44,860 --> 01:28:51,020
than I'd seen and and in my whole career when these big companies were inspecting these plants

1085
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:57,740
but I figured out a very simple scoring system if you couldn't shoot 95 of those cattle dead on

1086
01:28:57,740 --> 01:29:03,180
the first shot you failed the McDonald's audit it was that simple some very simple critical control

1087
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:07,020
points if you had more than three percent of your cattle beller in their heads off when you're

1088
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:12,780
handling them you failed the McDonald's audit okay so why why why did that turn out to be the critical

1089
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:19,660
issue well the broken stunts were a big issue now on the handling I figured out a way to score

1090
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:24,940
that that's very simple vocalization if you're poking cattle with too many electric prods or you're

1091
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:30,860
slamming doors on them or whatever they're going to be beller in their heads off and I better not

1092
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:35,500
hear any beller in coming out of the place where they kill them right here beller in coming out of

1093
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:40,860
there somebody needs to get kicked off the approved supplier list it's that simple that's one of the

1094
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:47,020
critical control right so you used so you used animal distress as an indication of that's right

1095
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:51,980
efficiency of process okay can you can you walk us through some of your designs

1096
01:29:51,980 --> 01:29:57,820
I mean you designed these these circular cattle enclosures as well to calm them down

1097
01:29:57,820 --> 01:30:02,940
the circular designs are really nice but I'm also very proud of the fact there were 75 plants

1098
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:09,020
on the McDonald's approved supplier list only three had to buy fancy expensive equipment

1099
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:13,820
everybody else we fixed with management yeah three managers had to be removed I call that

1100
01:30:13,820 --> 01:30:19,340
manager ectomy on a lot of non-slip flooring had to go in because one of the things we measure

1101
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:26,940
is slipping and falling and lighting cattle are scared of the dark on training people to move

1102
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:33,900
smaller groups of animals and and put a solid side up so they don't see the vehicles passing by

1103
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:39,660
and these very simple changes we were able to fix some of the older places and I'm very I used all

1104
01:30:39,660 --> 01:30:44,780
my design ability to figure out how to make some of the older facilities work even though they did

1105
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:51,980
not have the fancy new equipment and then we had three science only three plants had to do a front

1106
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:57,500
end remodel that was very very expensive that's three out of 75 I'm really proud of that oh yeah

1107
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:04,460
that's all a big port yeah yeah plants in the US right so so tell me tell me tell me tell me what

1108
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:09,420
your goals were okay so let's walk this through at the level of detail so why don't you tell people

1109
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:15,100
about how these cattle handling plants work broadly speaking from from the time the cattle arrived

1110
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:20,700
till the time they're processed let's say and then how were you brought in to fix them well

1111
01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:27,500
unloading a truck make sure you have a non-slip unloading ramp open the gates up let them out

1112
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:31,580
you do not need to scream at them pound on the vehicle or stick electric prads in through the

1113
01:31:31,580 --> 01:31:37,660
holes in the side of the truck so let the cattle just get off and they will and then they should

1114
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:43,180
walk quietly out of the truck if they got a scale weigh them on the scale and then quietly walk into

1115
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:47,980
a holding pen get a drink of water maybe a lay down then when it's time to go up to the plant

1116
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:55,660
somebody should come down bring a group of 20 out not a group of 50 and you quietly walk them up

1117
01:31:55,660 --> 01:32:01,980
the alley to where they get to where the round crowd pen is and the whole thing should be a calm walk

1118
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:09,020
without slipping and falling and without moving and bellowing and and almost no electric prads

1119
01:32:10,940 --> 01:32:14,380
that and it should all be very calm walking is what it should be

1120
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:23,900
right and and how many plants did you go analyze we had 75 plants on the on the approved supplier

1121
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:30,860
list and only three of them had to have extensive renovations but we did have three plants where

1122
01:32:30,860 --> 01:32:36,780
the plant manager had to be removed right and so in those cases yeah why did you remove the managers

1123
01:32:37,820 --> 01:32:41,100
well the ones where we're able to get rid of the plant manager were the corporate ones

1124
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:47,500
on the plant then we had one plant we used to call the problem child and manager was family and we

1125
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:51,740
couldn't get rid of it and that plant would like you know fail on audit and then pass an audit and

1126
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:59,660
but management has to decide that they're going to do things right you can have the best equipment

1127
01:33:00,620 --> 01:33:06,380
and it's not going to work if it's not managed in fact before we started these audits i had a

1128
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:11,660
lot of equipment out in the field lots of equipment half my clients tore it up and wrecked it and one

1129
01:33:11,660 --> 01:33:18,860
that what the customer inspections and audits did is force the plant to manage the stuff they had

1130
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:27,180
either brand new fancy stuff or older stuff and so how broadly did your innovation spread and how

1131
01:33:27,180 --> 01:33:31,900
rapidly and what were the consequences of that for the meat handling industry in general

1132
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:38,140
well the auditing program was within six months as in the year of 1999 was adopted by mcdonald's

1133
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:43,660
wendys and burger king and that covers just about all the big beef plants and i saw more

1134
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:50,620
improvement than i'd seen in a 25 year career prior to that people were no longer using broken

1135
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:57,340
equipment they were moving smaller groups of animals things were kept repaired and

1136
01:33:58,380 --> 01:34:02,140
and employees were better supervised and boy it made a big difference

1137
01:34:03,340 --> 01:34:08,700
so why do you think you were able to do this i mean you obviously can solve the problem

1138
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:15,660
practically but how are you able to um make your way in the corporate world in a manner that actually

1139
01:34:15,660 --> 01:34:20,940
resulted a in people listening to you and b in changes actually being made because that's

1140
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:26,300
that's quite a remarkable combination of unlikely achievements all right let's start off i started

1141
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:32,620
out with equipment this was in my 20s and i found that selling equipment was much easier than getting

1142
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:37,660
people to manage equipment correctly and early in my career i made the mistake that a lot of young

1143
01:34:37,660 --> 01:34:45,340
engineers make i thought i could make a self managing cattle handling facility that is bs and i got a

1144
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:49,820
lot of systems out there the other thing that helped me to get systems out into the industry

1145
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:55,980
is i wrote about them and i wrote about them in the meat industry and cattle industry trade press

1146
01:34:56,940 --> 01:35:02,380
wrote all kinds of articles just about how to do it so now i had a lot of equipment out there

1147
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:07,660
center track restrainer and lots and lots of these big plants had one it's a piece of equipment i

1148
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:13,340
developed with the guys in the shops that i've talked to you about earlier but half my clients tore

1149
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:19,340
it up and wrecked it then i worked with a lady named janet riley at the american meat institute

1150
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:27,340
and i came up with this very very simple scoring system for evaluating meat packing plants

1151
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:34,620
and we wrote it up in our guidelines nobody used it for two years then mcdonald's approached me

1152
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:43,580
to implement their animal welfare auditing program and it started out taking vice president level

1153
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:50,780
managers out of the office they saw some bad stuff and it started out as a little training program

1154
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:56,540
they already had food safety auditors in the plants auditing them that was already being done

1155
01:35:57,500 --> 01:36:01,900
and so i took the trains of food safety auditors to do the animal welfare audit

1156
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:09,100
and within six months i saw more change that i had seen in my whole career prior to that

1157
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:14,140
then wendy's got on board then burger king got on board and i made sure that everybody used the

1158
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:20,060
exact same score so it was absolutely clear it was like traffic rules you know you know they

1159
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:25,420
measure speeding we measured how many vocalizations the cattle did we measured how many animals

1160
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:31,020
fell down those things were measured and the plants had to make certain numbers it was

1161
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:35,900
absolutely clear there were five critical control points and they had to do all five of them to

1162
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:40,780
pass the audit i kind of sometimes can't believe i pulled it off it worked me on my wildest dreams

1163
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:49,100
but it was absolutely practical right right yeah well it did it is it is quite a remarkable

1164
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:53,660
thing to pull off to to be able to make that kind of change in the corporate world so quickly that's

1165
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:58,860
that's really quite remarkable the other reason i was able to make change i i practiced reverse

1166
01:36:58,860 --> 01:37:04,380
conflict of interest i had a lot of expensive equipment already out in the plants i've been

1167
01:37:04,380 --> 01:37:10,700
over backwards in the older facilities to figure out how to make that older facility work without

1168
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:16,300
buying expensive equipment let me tell you non-slip flooring it can work wonders you know we did quite

1169
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:22,220
a lot of that right but that's not that's not expensive equipment and i'm really proud of the

1170
01:37:22,220 --> 01:37:26,380
fact that i took some of the older facilities and we made them work and then we did have three

1171
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:33,100
only three out of 75 plants that had to build an expensive front-end remodel and that was very

1172
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:42,540
expensive so what would you say if if you had to put it into a few phrases you you weren't obviously

1173
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:47,980
pursuing mere narrow profit at that time not there's anything wrong with profit you you were

1174
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:54,300
serving some other goal i was serving the goal of improving animal welfare and i've been over

1175
01:37:54,300 --> 01:38:01,100
backwards to do reverse conflict of interest and i tried to take some of those older facilities

1176
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:09,020
right some of them a bit shabby and make them work with simple changes like repairs non-slip

1177
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:14,780
flooring changing the lighting and three plants had to have the plant manager removed and that's

1178
01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:20,620
great so what why were you why were you so concerned with animal welfare and how would you

1179
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:25,820
define animal welfare why did that become paramount in your in your hierarchy of goals

1180
01:38:27,020 --> 01:38:30,620
well one of the reasons why i started working on the equipment is like the way cattle were

1181
01:38:30,620 --> 01:38:35,980
being handled was horrible you know electric prods on 100 i'm falling down crashing into things

1182
01:38:35,980 --> 01:38:41,340
people screaming at them uh cattle handling in the 80s was terrible absolutely terrible

1183
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:48,780
and i i saw that as something that i could fix now i talked to a lot of young people the day

1184
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:53,660
that want to you know do activism about some specific thing and it's way too broad

1185
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:58,300
i want justice in the world for example right yes yes might be something they would say yes yes

1186
01:38:58,300 --> 01:39:04,140
and i say why don't you do something more targeted like using dna to show that this prisoner

1187
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:10,460
was falsely accused you see now that's something a lot more targeted that you can actually do

1188
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:15,820
yes absolutely and i think that is a huge problem with the way that kids are trained

1189
01:39:15,820 --> 01:39:24,220
morally in universities is that that grandiose vague uh activism replaces the actual practicalities

1190
01:39:24,220 --> 01:39:28,380
of problem solving that you're describing that actually make a difference why do you think it

1191
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:33,740
was that animal suffering stood out for you is it is it partly because you you can think like

1192
01:39:33,740 --> 01:39:37,660
animals like what why do you think well you would how would you like to get shocked to electric

1193
01:39:37,660 --> 01:39:42,700
prods and be slipping and falling and crashing and defenses and things like that you'd be terrified

1194
01:39:43,580 --> 01:39:51,500
um and my goal was to improve how the cattle were treated when i talked to students about you

1195
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:58,700
know activism i said what i worked on wasn't everything bad happening to animals i worked

1196
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:03,340
on something targeted the thing that i'm seeing now with young people that want to make a difference

1197
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:08,460
they say i want to have justice in the world or i want to like animals are treated terrible we got

1198
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:14,940
to do something about it and i'm saying you're going to be more effective if you pick out something

1199
01:40:14,940 --> 01:40:21,500
relatively targeted i worked on cattle handling to start with that's not everything to do with animals

1200
01:40:22,540 --> 01:40:28,940
yes exactly or the example of using dna to show that this criminal was innocent that's something

1201
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:35,740
much more doable and targeted that you can actually do right so how was it that the suffering of

1202
01:40:35,740 --> 01:40:41,340
animals in meat tracking in meat packing plants came to your attention to begin with so you said

1203
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:47,100
the suffering you found that unbearable first of all it started out when i went out to the feed yards

1204
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:51,500
handling cattle back in the 70s there's a lot of really horrible cattle handling

1205
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:59,260
and i i made a mistake in the beginning that a lot of young engineers make they think technology

1206
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:05,420
can solve all their problems and i mistakenly believed that i could build a self managing

1207
01:41:05,420 --> 01:41:11,500
cattle handling facility that's nonsense i know that now that's nonsense good equipment makes

1208
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:16,860
good handling better but it doesn't replace management and what the auditing program did

1209
01:41:16,860 --> 01:41:23,100
is it forced people to manage the facilities and why why were you at the cattle handling facilities

1210
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:27,740
to begin with i mean was this part of your academic training or was this part of the fact

1211
01:41:27,740 --> 01:41:33,180
that you'd grown up on a farm well i got interested in got to going out to my aunt's ranch and

1212
01:41:33,180 --> 01:41:37,340
this brings up the other thing students get interested in stuff they get exposed to

1213
01:41:38,940 --> 01:41:44,700
it's that simple in in one of the people i profiled in visual thinking was michael angelo

1214
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:51,260
grubby little 12 year old dropped out of school but he was running around all the churches seeing

1215
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:57,420
great art and he grew up with stone cutting tools okay that's the exposure then he started

1216
01:41:57,420 --> 01:42:01,820
making some stuff and then an artist took him in as an apprentice that's mentoring

1217
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:07,340
good careers start first with exposure and the other reason why i'm so concerned about

1218
01:42:07,340 --> 01:42:12,380
taking all the hands-on stuff out of the schools is those things like let's say theater for example

1219
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:19,020
exposed students i didn't care about being in the play but i loved making scene rate and costumes

1220
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:26,140
that i love to do it now that's something that can become a career so let me let me we're running

1221
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:30,140
out of time on this segment let me ask you one more question and then maybe i'll sum up our

1222
01:42:30,140 --> 01:42:35,820
discussion for everybody or try to extract out the gist you think primarily in pictures but you're

1223
01:42:35,820 --> 01:42:40,380
also an extremely effective verbal communicator i mean you've written a number of books you can

1224
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:46,060
obviously talk your way into corporate environments and help people walk through the complex process

1225
01:42:46,060 --> 01:42:50,940
of restructuring say animal handling on a pretty much on a national scale how did you

1226
01:42:51,660 --> 01:42:56,540
how do you think you've been able to develop your verbal ability like what what did you do to

1227
01:42:56,540 --> 01:43:01,740
manage that all right it goes back to when i was seven years old and in my neighborhood all the

1228
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:06,060
kids when they were seven when the parents had a party you had to put your good clothes on greet

1229
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:12,620
the guests and serve the snacks be little hosts and hostesses that's what you had to do um i sold

1230
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:18,620
candy for charity that helped me on talking to people the other thing i figured out very early on

1231
01:43:18,620 --> 01:43:24,780
is backdoors into jobs and most people don't see this in the hbo movie temple grand and there's a

1232
01:43:24,780 --> 01:43:30,780
scene where i go up to the editor of our state farm magazine and i get his card because i knew if i

1233
01:43:30,780 --> 01:43:37,980
wrote for that magazine that would help my career that's a back door writing i did a lot of writing

1234
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:44,700
this how to handle cattle how to design facilities and i was so happy when one of my very early

1235
01:43:44,700 --> 01:43:50,780
articles got picked up by two other magazines you know it had made the national scene of course this

1236
01:43:50,780 --> 01:43:56,620
is all you know pre-internet and then that press pass got me into all kinds of meetings that helped

1237
01:43:56,620 --> 01:44:03,660
me to get into my next self-made internship with a swift plant i've recognized the back doors most

1238
01:44:03,660 --> 01:44:09,020
people don't recognize the back doors but lots of good jobs are gotten through the back door

1239
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:16,860
right so you allied your ability to concentrate on focal details practically with the ability

1240
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:21,740
and the willingness to communicate on at all sorts of different levels verbally

1241
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:27,260
you were able to bring both that's getting too abstract for me i just go okay i got the card

1242
01:44:27,340 --> 01:44:32,780
within a week i i may i had done a master's thesis on cattle behavior in different types of

1243
01:44:32,780 --> 01:44:39,660
squeeze shoots and i i sent them a good article and they published it then i went back to them and

1244
01:44:39,660 --> 01:44:45,340
said maybe i could just write something for you every month i just walked into the office and

1245
01:44:45,340 --> 01:44:49,180
asked that job so i did that as a volunteer for about three or four months and then they started

1246
01:44:49,180 --> 01:44:59,020
paying me i wasn't shy to walk up and ask right right so so you developed a communication

1247
01:44:59,020 --> 01:45:03,740
communication expertise and a communication network at the same time that you were trying to

1248
01:45:03,740 --> 01:45:08,860
implement your practical solutions and both of those facilitated each other well in the very

1249
01:45:08,860 --> 01:45:14,620
beginning i wasn't even designing facilities and then i was just visiting all these feed yards

1250
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:20,860
and writing for the magazine and that press pass got me into all kinds of places

1251
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:27,500
i recognized the value of that press pass it got me into meetings in the 70s with $600

1252
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:34,060
registration fees i was no way i could have afforded that this is 70s right right right

1253
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:39,020
so what are what are you working on now you finished this this new book that came out in 2022

1254
01:45:39,020 --> 01:45:44,220
what are you doing now well i'm very interested in seeing the kids who think differently

1255
01:45:44,220 --> 01:45:50,380
get into good careers and that's going to be a major emphasis of the things that i do now be a

1256
01:45:50,380 --> 01:45:55,500
lot of speaking engagements a lot of you know interviews like this because i want to see those

1257
01:45:55,500 --> 01:46:02,060
kids that are different get into good jobs okay if they're visual object visualizer like me maybe

1258
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:08,220
art job maybe photography job or a job building things if they're the more mathematical visual

1259
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:15,660
spatial a good programming job a good on mathematics or chemistry job where you need the

1260
01:46:15,660 --> 01:46:21,260
mathematics there's too many kids that think differently i'm some of them just kind of going

1261
01:46:21,260 --> 01:46:27,500
nowhere i want to see them get into good careers and do things that will be constructive in the

1262
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:35,740
world do something constructive so we're we're going to switch over to the additional half an

1263
01:46:35,740 --> 01:46:40,380
hour that i produced for the daily wire plus platform to delve into some of the biographical

1264
01:46:40,380 --> 01:46:46,380
details of your life before we close i'd like to just sort of wander over the territory that we've

1265
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:50,460
covered and see if there's anything else see if you think this is a reasonable summary and if

1266
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:56,220
there's anything else you want to add i've been talking with dr. temple grand in today

1267
01:46:56,220 --> 01:47:04,140
who's who's developed a spectacular career in modifying animal handling and also managed a lot

1268
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:09,340
on the more purely intellectual front as well in terms of conceptualization of information

1269
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:17,340
processing she's uh we talked a lot today about the difference in in in the ways that people think

1270
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:22,460
concentrating mostly on the distinction between visual thinkers who tend to be more practical

1271
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:28,220
and detail oriented and who are can be broadly differentiated into two categories and those

1272
01:47:28,220 --> 01:47:35,020
would be object visualizers and people who think more visually and mathematically contrasting them

1273
01:47:35,020 --> 01:47:41,340
with people who think more verbally we talked a fair bit about the prioritization of more verbal

1274
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:47,820
and abstract thinking at the cost of this practical thinking and training in that practical thinking

1275
01:47:47,820 --> 01:47:53,340
we discussed how that's affected the school system and broader culture we discussed the dangers that

1276
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:59,180
poses to the integrity of our society as we lose the people who have the hands-on knowledge

1277
01:47:59,180 --> 01:48:05,020
we talked about the psychological danger that poses to people who think more practically

1278
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:11,420
concretely and and visually who are in school systems that are optimized for the verbal thinkers

1279
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:22,460
we talked about temples um career at the detail level um ameliorating the suffering of animals

1280
01:48:22,460 --> 01:48:29,580
that across like nationally and internationally as it turned out partly because she decided

1281
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:36,300
not to chase mere generalities but to focus on an actual problem which was the suffering of actual

1282
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:43,740
animals in actual plants was willing to focus her um emotional concerns on something that was

1283
01:48:43,740 --> 01:48:49,420
practical and to marry that with a strategy that involved particularization and visualization

1284
01:48:49,420 --> 01:48:55,740
and verbal communication and practical interactions with corporations and also we closed

1285
01:48:55,740 --> 01:49:00,540
that with a discussion of the fact that what she's doing now is trying to bring to people's

1286
01:49:00,540 --> 01:49:08,060
attention in podcasts like this the fact that we seem to be um working contrary to our own

1287
01:49:08,620 --> 01:49:17,820
best interests by not um building educational facilities that help optimize the ability of

1288
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:24,620
visual thinkers to function but also for society more broadly to take advantage of the

1289
01:49:24,620 --> 01:49:30,460
talents and skills of those people in the in innovation and in the maintenance of the infrastructure

1290
01:49:30,460 --> 01:49:35,660
that we already have around us and so I think that about summarizes what we talked about today

1291
01:49:35,660 --> 01:49:41,020
is there anything you want to add to that that definitely you know kind of um kind of summarizes

1292
01:49:41,020 --> 01:49:45,580
that we need all the different kinds of minds and they can when we understand that different

1293
01:49:45,580 --> 01:49:51,660
people think differently they can work in teams where they can collaborate and have complementary

1294
01:49:51,660 --> 01:49:58,540
skills I think that's that's uh something that's really important also right right right the thing

1295
01:49:58,540 --> 01:50:04,300
I want to one thing I would do with the schools is I'd put a lot of the hands-on classes back in

1296
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:11,100
like art sewing woodworking shop welding auto mechanics theater because these are all things

1297
01:50:11,660 --> 01:50:15,740
expose kids to to things that can become possible careers too

1298
01:50:17,980 --> 01:50:21,980
right and those are all things that have to be done they're in an embodied sense you actually

1299
01:50:21,980 --> 01:50:27,420
have to it's not purely abstract any it's not abstract none of those things are abstract

1300
01:50:29,340 --> 01:50:33,900
yeah well that's I suppose a danger of moving so much education online as well as that it's going

1301
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:40,140
to increase the degree well that's right the other thing when I went to did the book signing

1302
01:50:40,140 --> 01:50:44,380
for visual thinking I told you about the electrical engineering book from the 30s I found in this

1303
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:50,700
unique hotel room but I also got put in the office of a professor in political science

1304
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:57,420
and I looked at some of those books and it was so abstract theories about politics I I didn't

1305
01:50:57,420 --> 01:51:03,500
even understand it it had nothing to do with right or left it had to do with just abstractions

1306
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:08,780
that were so abstract it made no sense to me now I'm going oh I wouldn't want this person in charge of

1307
01:51:08,780 --> 01:51:15,260
figuring out with the power bread you know I remember at this Tucson conference where I first

1308
01:51:15,260 --> 01:51:21,260
saw you speak after you spoke very practical talk very much like the one that you you delivered

1309
01:51:21,260 --> 01:51:25,980
today when we were talking a philosophy student got up because there were a lot of abstract thinkers

1310
01:51:25,980 --> 01:51:32,140
at this consciousness conference and asked you something extremely abstract and philosophical

1311
01:51:32,140 --> 01:51:37,260
and you did exactly what I would expect a good engineer to do which was to say you know I really

1312
01:51:37,260 --> 01:51:41,980
don't understand anything that you just said I don't know how to associate it with anything

1313
01:51:41,980 --> 01:51:46,940
practical and I'm completely unable to answer your question which I thought was just it was

1314
01:51:46,940 --> 01:51:53,820
ridiculously comical and I also thought um what would you say well targeted because it was the case

1315
01:51:53,820 --> 01:51:58,620
that you know you had been talking about real practical realities your ability to think like

1316
01:51:58,620 --> 01:52:04,140
an animal the fact that you had taken these practical set steps to ameliorate animal suffering

1317
01:52:04,140 --> 01:52:12,380
and that that had been so consequential and and so of obvious worth and then you were faced with this

1318
01:52:13,100 --> 01:52:18,540
flight into abstraction and and did what engineers always did do which is something like well yeah

1319
01:52:18,540 --> 01:52:22,700
but I don't understand that what does it mean practically which is a really good question

1320
01:52:22,700 --> 01:52:26,940
that you know it's a question that should be asked of abstract thinkers all the time what are the

1321
01:52:26,940 --> 01:52:32,780
devils in the details here that you're overlooking how much do you know about the systems that you're

1322
01:52:32,780 --> 01:52:38,940
abstractly representing and the answer to that is usually almost nothing well it's sort of like

1323
01:52:39,660 --> 01:52:43,580
you know we need all the three different base you know different kinds of minds you need the

1324
01:52:43,580 --> 01:52:49,980
object visualizers you know we're going to get the arts mechanical and photography and animals

1325
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:55,740
you need the visual spatial mathematicians computer programmers chemists things that require

1326
01:52:55,740 --> 01:53:01,900
mathematics and we need the verbal thinkers because they're going to help organize things

1327
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:07,420
you see you need yeah all three different kinds of minds and they should work together in a

1328
01:53:07,420 --> 01:53:14,460
complementary fashion all right well that's a good place to end this segment I would say I'm going

1329
01:53:14,460 --> 01:53:20,220
to go thank you thank you to everyone on YouTube and the associated podcast for your time and

1330
01:53:20,220 --> 01:53:26,220
attention I hope you found this discussion interesting and engaging and practically useful

1331
01:53:26,220 --> 01:53:32,140
as well I'm going to switch switch over to the daily wire plus platform and I'm going to talk to

1332
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:37,660
dr. temple grand and a little bit more on the biographical and I want to lay out how her

1333
01:53:37,660 --> 01:53:42,780
her interest in the issues that she did pursue professionally made themselves manifest in her

1334
01:53:42,780 --> 01:53:48,940
life hello everyone I would encourage you to continue listening to my conversation with my

1335
01:53:48,940 --> 01:53:53,980
guest on dailywireplus.com
