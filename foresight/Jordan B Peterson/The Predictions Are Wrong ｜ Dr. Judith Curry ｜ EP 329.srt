1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
It leaves me open mouthed in amazement that we in the developed world with our functional

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,840
economies and our high level of luxury and security can say to developing worlds the

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,800
developing world, well, you know, we've got a pretty good here and we're probably willing

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,800
to cut back a little bit, but you guys down there in the developing countries, you know,

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,800
you should be pretty damn careful about your carbon output.

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,080
We're not going to help you develop your economy so that you can benefit from the same industrial

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:35,640
revolution that has enabled us to educate our children and to have plenty to eat and

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,240
to be warm in the winter and cool in the summer.

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,320
And then what's even more preposterous is it's the very people who are constantly clamoring

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:50,120
about the oppressive nature of Western culture who are foisting this very story on these

11
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,440
developed countries.

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:59,440
Yeah, the irony is that even if the African nations were given, you know, the carbon credits

13
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,440
or whatever and allowed to develop to where they want to be and where anyone expects them

14
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,360
to be, at most they would be emitting like five or six percent of global emissions and

15
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,960
this is for like a billion people in the population.

16
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,400
We're not talking about a lot of extra emissions to allow them to develop.

17
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,920
I mean, it just makes absolutely no sense and it's evil.

18
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,320
It's absolutely evil.

19
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,160
Hello everyone on YouTube and associated platforms.

20
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,160
I'm here today with another climate denialist because, you know, I've been racking those

21
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,160
up.

22
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,440
It's all part of my attempt to become the most reprehensible commentator on YouTube.

23
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,080
And so, at least in the eyes of those who think they're my enemies.

24
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,240
Anyways, I'm talking to Dr. Judith Curry today, a very accomplished scientist.

25
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,760
She's an American climatologist with a bachelor in science degree in geography, she earned

26
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,240
out at Northern Illinois University and a geophysical sciences PhD from the University

27
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,760
of Chicago.

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,520
Curry is the professor emerita and former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric

29
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,880
Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,760
She's had an accomplished career working with NASA, the U.S. government and numerous

31
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,520
academic institutions in the field of climate change.

32
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:35,160
A real scientist with 190 publications, Curry advocates, so reprehensibly, for a non-alarmist

33
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,240
approach acknowledging Earth's rising temperature with a grain of salt.

34
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,280
The grain being in field research and a refusal to shut the doors of science to those with

35
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,520
contrary views and findings.

36
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:52,240
In 2017, Dr. Curry retired from reposition at the Georgia Institute of Technology, citing

37
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:59,760
the poisonous nature of the scientific discussion around man-made climate change as a key factor.

38
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,880
Curry co-founded and acts as president of the Climate Forecast Applications Network,

39
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,600
a company, a private company which seeks to translate cutting-edge weather and climate

40
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,280
research into tenable forecast products.

41
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,280
Insurance companies, financial institutions rely on Dr. Curry to provide them with information

42
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,360
that can guide them with regard to their future financial decision-making.

43
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,000
She's a controversial figure on the climate front, being somewhat of a contrarian in regard

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,440
to the hypothetical scientific consensus on the climate apocalypse front.

45
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,840
So the first thing I'd like to ask you, Dr. Curry, is if you would walk people through

46
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:44,160
your professional qualifications and to let everyone know why it is that you might be

47
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,640
regarded as a credible commentator on such issues.

48
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:56,800
Okay, well I received my PhD in 1982 in Geophysical Sciences from the University of Chicago.

49
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:05,440
And I spent my entire career in academia with jobs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,

50
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:13,360
Purdue University, Penn State University, University of Colorado Boulder, and most recently

51
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,520
at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

52
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:22,400
And at Georgia Tech, I served as chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences

53
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,080
for 13 years.

54
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:34,080
I've written several books and published about 190 journal articles.

55
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:42,360
I'm a fellow of several major professional societies, have received some recognition

56
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,280
for my research.

57
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,960
I left my university position in 2017.

58
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,600
I felt it was too constraining.

59
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,960
I wanted to do a broader range of things.

60
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,160
And I had started a company about 10 years before.

61
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:09,320
It was a startup under Georgia Tech's Venture Lab program.

62
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:17,360
And so then I started devoting full time to it after I left academia.

63
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:26,920
I inadvertently stepped into the limelight on the global warming issue in 2005.

64
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:35,200
If you recall at the time of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans, I and my co-authors

65
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:44,120
had a paper that was published in the journal Science two weeks after Katrina hit.

66
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:52,080
And we had found that the percentage of category four and five hurricanes had doubled in recent

67
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,480
decades.

68
00:05:53,480 --> 00:06:00,120
And so this was with rather explosive media attention.

69
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:06,840
And this was the first time that I did TV interviews or anything like that.

70
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,720
And it was a very antagonistic debate.

71
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,840
People were coming at us from all sides.

72
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:21,720
Of course, the Enviro advocacy groups thought I was the greatest thing since sliced bread.

73
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:30,400
There are a lot of people on the other side of the debate thought I was absolutely evil.

74
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,160
So for the first time, I started giving a lot of public lectures.

75
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,040
And people would invariably ask me questions that were outside of my expertise or knowledge.

76
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,160
Everyone was asking about the hockey stick, for example, or what's going on with the sun

77
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,160
and all these kind of things.

78
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:55,720
And I figure, oh, my gosh, I really need to just step out beyond my personal areas of

79
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:02,320
expertise and try to understand a lot more of this, which I did.

80
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:09,240
And eventually the hurricane and global warming issues settled down a little bit.

81
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,480
And then a few years later, climate gates struck.

82
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:22,560
This was in November of 2009 with the unauthorized release of emails from the University of East

83
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,560
Anglia.

84
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:31,680
It was a very big scandal at the time, IPCC authors hiding the decline, Mike's nature

85
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,800
trick, all this kind of stuff.

86
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,320
And it was hugely important politically and it's believed to have derailed the Waxman

87
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:47,440
Markey bill that was making progress towards being passed.

88
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,360
And then this just pretty much derailed it.

89
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:58,120
And I took the controversial step of saying, we need to do better.

90
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,920
We need to make all of our data publicly available.

91
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,360
We need to make our methods transparent.

92
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:10,040
We need to pay more attention to uncertainty and be more honest about the level of confidence

93
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,800
we actually have in this stuff.

94
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:21,280
And we also need to pay attention to skeptics and treat them with respect and pay attention

95
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,200
to their arguments and refute them if they're serious.

96
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,880
And to me, this sounded like motherhood and apple pie kind of thing.

97
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,880
Right, absolutely.

98
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:38,120
Okay, but the people within the climate community were very angry at me, saying that I needed

99
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,680
to be more sensitive to the feelings of the scientists who were involved.

100
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,880
Excuse me, no one was sensitive to my feelings during the hurricane and global warming wars.

101
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,440
And also, I wasn't worried about their feelings.

102
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:02,320
I was worried about the IPCC and the credibility of it and what we should be doing about this.

103
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:10,040
There were much bigger issues at stake here than the feelings of these scientists.

104
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,200
Well, anybody, any scientist who talks to you about whether you're hurting their feelings

105
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,240
when you're launching a discussion of the factual basis of their claims has immediately

106
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,200
stepped outside of the scientific domain.

107
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,400
I mean, one of the things I loved about being a scientist was that the rules of engagement

108
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,200
at professional conferences, let's say, that were genuinely scientific in nature were pretty

109
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,200
damn clear.

110
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:42,600
I mean, we were discussing the empirical and statistical reliability and validity of your

111
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,120
claims on a technical basis.

112
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,120
That was that.

113
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,800
And if we weren't doing that, it wasn't science.

114
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,960
And so the idea that what you should be attending to when you're criticizing someone's work,

115
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,880
which doesn't mean denigrating it, it means trying to separate the wheat from the chaff,

116
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
by the way.

117
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:03,440
It has nothing to do with your regard for the emotional well-being of your, say, antagonist.

118
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,560
I mean, you could be polite and that's helpful, but it's also not mandatory.

119
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,560
Right.

120
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,040
But well, there's a subtlety here because I was not so much criticizing the substance

121
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:20,640
of the science, but the behavior of the scientists that I felt violated the norms of science

122
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:32,320
in terms of everybody, universalism, everybody should have a chance or a shot at the data.

123
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:40,320
We should listen to skeptics and we should try to keep politics out of our science to

124
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,000
the extent that we can.

125
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,120
I mean, these are the kind of behaviors.

126
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:52,360
These emails reveal people trying to get editors fired, playing fast and loose with

127
00:10:52,360 --> 00:11:00,520
the guidelines of the IPCC, evade Freedom of Information Act requests from people they

128
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,340
thought would challenge their research.

129
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:07,640
This kind of behavior that I strenuously objected to and I thought that we should not defend

130
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,720
and we should call out.

131
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,760
So I was not challenging the substance of anybody's science.

132
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,480
It was really the behavior in the public debate on climate.

133
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,480
Right.

134
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,920
Well, that is a form of, that is a form in some sense of methodological criticism.

135
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,920
Yes.

136
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,680
I mean, your point was that there's rules to the investigative process and the communication

137
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,880
process and politicization breaks those rules and the response on the front of the climate

138
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,000
apocalypse, let's say, you see this with biologists who are concerned about extinction from time

139
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,400
to time too, is that, well, this issue is so important that it's unethical to abide by

140
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,760
those normative principles because we need to do everything we can to draw as much attention

141
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:56,080
to this looming catastrophe as possible and in some sense, all is fair in love and war.

142
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,440
And that would be fine if they were correct and 100% correct possibly, although I still

143
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,280
think they're violating the science politics distinction.

144
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,800
But when there's doubt and there's substantial doubt here, then that's a real problem.

145
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,960
I wanted to take apart some of the things you said, so you came at this in a very interesting

146
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,640
way in some sense because the first time that you rose to something approximating public

147
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,880
prominence, you were actually putting forth a set of propositions that you could argue

148
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:31,360
supported a more dire view of climate outcome, making the claim that these hurricanes, severe

149
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,420
hurricanes had increased in frequency.

150
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:38,680
Do you believe now that have they continued to increase in frequency or was that a momentary

151
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,680
spike?

152
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,680
Do you know that literature still?

153
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,680
Oh, yes.

154
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:47,800
Okay, first off, there were lots of potshots thrown at us.

155
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,920
The couple of criticisms turned out to be valid.

156
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:57,200
One is that the global data before 1985 is pretty dodgy.

157
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:04,360
We went back to 1970, so realistically, you have to throw out 15 years.

158
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:10,960
And the other thing was looking at just the natural variability and could we really distinguish

159
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,480
a warming signal from the natural variability?

160
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,240
And at this point, we still can't with a lot of confidence.

161
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,840
Yeah, well, a big part of the problem here is what time frame over, this is a huge problem

162
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,880
and I don't even know how you solve it in some sense.

163
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,920
If you're trying to define something like a trend towards cooling or warming or increased

164
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,280
or decreased variability, the question that immediately arises, well, are you talking

165
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:43,200
about a hundred years or a thousand or 10,000 or a million, like there's an infinite number

166
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,160
of time frames to consider and-

167
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,360
Exactly, that is a key challenge.

168
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:54,400
And one of my major themes coming out of the climate gate thing was a more serious look

169
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,200
at uncertainty.

170
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,920
And I wrote a paper called Climate Change and the Uncertainty Monster.

171
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:09,560
And I used that paper, a series of, you know, to launch my blog, Climate Etc, JudithCarré.com

172
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,000
in 2010.

173
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,840
And again, this was people outside the clique of establishment climate scientists thought

174
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
this was great.

175
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,840
This is important.

176
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
This is obvious.

177
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,800
However, within the clique, they viewed me as trying to destroy a consensus that they

178
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,240
had been trying to build for 20 years.

179
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:38,320
Well, this manufactured consensus and it was on very flimsy ground, you know, and there

180
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,320
was no-

181
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,080
Okay, how would you characterize that so-called consensus?

182
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,800
Is that associated with this idea?

183
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,080
I talked to Richard Frenzen about this recently.

184
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:54,840
Is that associated with the idea that like 97% of scientists agree that, well, it isn't

185
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,520
clear what they agree, that's the issue, is that climate change is a severe and catastrophic

186
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,920
problem, which is that statement in itself is not true by any stretch of the imagination.

187
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,680
What's the consensus here?

188
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,880
Okay, the issue is the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

189
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:17,480
They did their first assessment report in like 1991 and following that, I mean, that was

190
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,480
a good report.

191
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,800
There was a good assessment at the time.

192
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,720
And then the powers that be says we need to strive for consensus in our statements.

193
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,640
And so this sort of narrowed the framing and the people they were picking to be on the

194
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,360
committee were people who were all going to agree.

195
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,800
And so they were working to manufacture a consensus.

196
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:45,680
You know, it was their view of how the policy process deals with uncertainty.

197
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,560
So it was sort of a speaking consensus to power approach.

198
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,000
And this was like formalized by the IPCC.

199
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,720
And you know, people challenging the consensus, and there's many dimensions to it, but the

200
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:10,760
most fundamental one is that most of the warming that we've seen since 1950 is caused by humans.

201
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,880
I mean, that's the most central consensus statement.

202
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,280
There is warming, that there is warming, even though now the narrative has changed, that

203
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,760
there is warming.

204
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,240
There's a certain idea about its potential magnitude.

205
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,800
And then hypothetically, the consensus is that what, about 50% of that is to do human

206
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
activity?

207
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:36,720
No, they used to make the statement more than half, but they really meant 100%.

208
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:43,040
But there's certainly no scientific consensus that 100% of the global warming that's occurring

209
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,120
at the moment is anthropogenic.

210
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,120
I don't believe it.

211
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,680
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, there isn't a scientific, okay.

212
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,680
There's no measure.

213
00:16:51,680 --> 00:17:00,840
I mean, when you have a complex, highly uncertain situation like this, the issue of consensus

214
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,640
is scientifically meaningless.

215
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:11,160
It's only meaningful, you know, for political purposes, this whole idea of speaking consensus

216
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,840
to power, that that was some pathway, you know, to policymaking, it hasn't really turned

217
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,840
out to be.

218
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,920
Yeah, so, yeah, there's no consensus, the most recent...

219
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:32,200
Well, it's also a preposterous claim scientifically, because the way science works is that a great

220
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,040
scientist is the first person who challenges the consensus.

221
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,920
That's kind of how you define a great scientist.

222
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,880
One of the things that's so wonderful about science is that it can reveal when the universal

223
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,000
consensus is wrong.

224
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,440
And it's powerful in its methods precisely because of that.

225
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,280
And you know that as a practicing researcher, is that the probability that you're going

226
00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:01,000
to do a study and that the data is going to reveal the consensus of your lab's theory,

227
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,560
the validity of the consensus of your lab's theory is basically zero.

228
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,640
So, the idea that something unexpected is going to crop up when you actually test your

229
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,640
idea against reality itself.

230
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,640
So, the idea that science is consensus-based is...

231
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,640
It's wrong.

232
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
It's wrong.

233
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,640
It's amazing that the idea got anywhere.

234
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,640
Okay, look at the social factors in play.

235
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:32,640
Okay, there was a big drive by the UN to deal with human, you know, dangerous anthropogenic

236
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,640
climate change.

237
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,720
It was a 1992 treaty before we even had any evidence of human cause warming at all.

238
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,720
Okay?

239
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,920
And then you had scientists become invested in this, you know, in their career goals and

240
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,440
the funding that comes into the field and all of this kind of stuff.

241
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,720
There was this sort of social contract between the scientists and the policy makers that

242
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,000
perpetuated this situation and, you know, and they were...

243
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,080
The policy makers, we need, you know, more, you know, we need more and more confident

244
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:12,800
statements from the IPCC even though the dimensions of the problem were growing and growing and

245
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:18,120
growing every year and clearly becoming more complex and obvious that there were a lot

246
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,800
of things that we didn't understand.

247
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,480
But there was this drive, you know.

248
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,360
Well, it's not as if the IPC documents themselves or even that radical.

249
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:35,560
I mean, my understanding of the IPC documents is that the projection is something like one

250
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:41,440
to two degrees of further warming with some increase in variability, especially in the

251
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,960
polar regions and a small degree of sea level rise.

252
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:53,840
No indication in the IPCC reports that this will produce runaway out-of-control feedback

253
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,200
loops that will have a devastating consequence, no real vision of apocalypse.

254
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:06,400
And so that's not quite correct until, until recently, people were looking at projections

255
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:12,560
of four to five degrees centigrade more warming over the course of the 21st century.

256
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:22,000
OK, the issue was wildly ridiculous emissions projections, which are now believed to be

257
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,240
implausible.

258
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,840
The more recent IPCC assessment report with more plausible emissions scenarios is looking

259
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,520
at more two to three degrees centigrade of warming.

260
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:41,720
And we've already had one degree, so it's an additional one to two degrees centigrade

261
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,000
of warming that people expect based on the climate models.

262
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,520
So they were pretty alarming up until recently because everyone was focused on this extreme

263
00:20:53,520 --> 00:21:01,400
emissions scenario, which is now widely accepted as implausible, if not impossible.

264
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,880
So there was a lot of alarm and all the, you know, when you talk about all the projections

265
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,200
of extreme weather events and we won't be able to grow wine in California and crazy

266
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:18,000
projections of sea level rise, all these projections were tied to that extreme emissions

267
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,760
scenario and it's taken a community a long time to reject it.

268
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:30,840
In fact, this extreme emissions scenario was still the most often, the most widely used

269
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:38,800
in the sixth assessment report, which was published only like two years ago.

270
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:46,560
So I mean, this is still pervasive, these excessively alarming projections of what could

271
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:55,560
happen in the 21st century, mostly driven by implausible to impossible emissions scenario,

272
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,360
but also driven by climate models that are running too hot.

273
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,760
Okay, let's go into that a bit.

274
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:07,640
So I talked to Richard Linsen about a week ago about the problems with models.

275
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:13,760
He said, for example, that the models are based on cells, let's say, so those would

276
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,640
be, the whole earth can't be modeled, so you have to oversimplify it, you have to clump

277
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,560
it into chunks, and the chunks are about 70 miles wide, they don't, they can't really

278
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,880
model cloud activity very well.

279
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,200
There's a lot of error in relationship to projecting and forecasting the effect of

280
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,240
water vapor.

281
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,000
The models, the models have to build a lot of assumptions in and that doesn't mean that

282
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:43,960
we shouldn't build models, but it does mean that they have very large potential for error,

283
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,760
and that error is magnified as you project out into the future.

284
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,480
And so I've read, for example, you tell me if you think this is accurate, that our estimates

285
00:22:53,480 --> 00:23:00,340
of the cumulative effect of carbon dioxide on global warming or climate change are smaller

286
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,960
than our estimates of the magnitude of our error in measuring the effect of water vapor.

287
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:11,320
And that's a big problem because water vapor is a major contributor to warming in principle,

288
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:16,200
and so if carbon dioxide effects are under the size of the error in that measurement,

289
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,400
that's really well.

290
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,240
Well, I wouldn't put it that way.

291
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,840
We have a pretty good idea of how much water vapor is in the atmosphere.

292
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,080
The question is, how is that going to change with warming?

293
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,480
The bigger issue is the clouds, what clouds are doing.

294
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:42,880
Clouds have a huge, and they're not modeled very well, and the observational basis for

295
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,880
understanding how they're trending only goes back a few decades.

296
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:55,280
So that's a tough one, but the net result of these uncertainties in water vapor and

297
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:02,680
cloud feedback is that we don't know how sensitive the climate is to increasing CO2 because

298
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:09,520
the way the models treat it is that CO2 and clouds amplify the warming.

299
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,880
And I think the cloud feedback might even be negative.

300
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:22,040
Water vapor does overall amplify the warming, but in the tropics where Richard Linsen has

301
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:28,120
done his research, he proposes that there is a negative feedback, and that's something

302
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,880
that's hotly debated, but I think the clouds are the bigger issue.

303
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,880
But apart from what's going on in the atmosphere, to me, it's really the oceans and the sun

304
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:43,920
that are the biggest sources of uncertainty in terms of understanding what's going on

305
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,880
and be able to project into the future.

306
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,880
So there are...

307
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,880
Okay, why the oceans?

308
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,880
Oh my goodness.

309
00:24:49,880 --> 00:25:00,340
Okay, the oceans have these large circulation systems overturning El Niño, La Niña.

310
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,800
People are familiar with that.

311
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,160
That's a mode of natural internal variability.

312
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:13,040
There's also decadal and multi-decadal oscillation cycles that change the patterns of clouds,

313
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:18,480
the whole patterns of sea surface temperature, influence of snowfall on Greenland, the Arctic,

314
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:24,440
sea ice, rainfall, regional climates, et cetera, and the models don't treat these very well.

315
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:30,520
There's a whole spectrum of these ocean circulations all on out to 10,000 years.

316
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,120
You have millennial scale overturning that influences the climate.

317
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:43,440
And the models have far too little power in that part of the spectrum.

318
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,440
So we're just missing that.

319
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,820
And so is that a consequence?

320
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:54,680
Does that mean that the degree to which the ocean takes up carbon dioxide is permeated

321
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,760
by error in measurement?

322
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:01,920
Is it also an indication of our lack of understanding of how the temperature of the ocean itself

323
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,280
is regulated by the motion of water from the depths up to the top?

324
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,280
All of that?

325
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,280
Oh, yeah.

326
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,480
Is that where the error is?

327
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,980
Well, no.

328
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:16,640
Vertical transport of heat and carbon in the ocean is part of the consequences of the uncertainty

329
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,480
in these large-scale circulations.

330
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,920
But more fundamentally, these large-scale...

331
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,480
They change the weather patterns and change the clouds, among other things.

332
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:33,840
So this is trying to get all that modeled right, let alone making credible predictions

333
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,840
into the future.

334
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,440
We're not there, not even close to being there.

335
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,600
And then once you get into the sun, it's even crazier.

336
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:54,600
The IPCC has pretty much dismissed the role of the sun in the last 150 years.

337
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:00,760
But the interesting thing is that in the Six Assessment Report, Chapter 6, they finally

338
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:06,840
acknowledged the great uncertainty in the amount of solar forcing in the late 20th century.

339
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:15,240
And this arises from there was a gap in the satellites measuring the sun output that occur

340
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:22,820
at the time of the Challenger shuttle disaster, if you recall that.

341
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:27,460
And so one solar sensor was running out, and they were supposed to launch another one,

342
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:32,740
but all the launches were put off for a number of years until they sorted out what was going

343
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,420
on at NASA with the launches and everything.

344
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:44,700
So there's this so-called gap, and depending on what was actually happening in that gap,

345
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:50,260
you can tune the solar variability to high variability or low variability.

346
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:56,380
So all the climate models are being run with low solar variability forcing, but for the

347
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:02,900
first time, Chapter 2 in the observational chapter of the Six Assessment Report acknowledged

348
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,660
this issue that there is huge amount of variability.

349
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:12,180
And this doesn't even factor in the so-called solar indirect effects in terms of there's

350
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:18,820
a lot of it's not just the heat from the sun, there's a lot of issues related to ultraviolet

351
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:24,180
and stratosphere and cosmic rays and magnetic fields and all these other things that really

352
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,940
aren't being factored in.

353
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:29,700
They're at the forefront of research, but they're certainly not factored into the climate

354
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,700
models.

355
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:39,140
So there are so many uncertainties out there that affect certainly the projections of what

356
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:45,540
might happen in the 21st century, but also our interpretation of what's been going on

357
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:54,660
with the climate for the last 100 years ago and exactly what's been causing what.

358
00:28:54,660 --> 00:29:00,380
The current administration's New Year's goals are to tax spend and turn a blind eye to inflation.

359
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:04,020

374
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:06,580
So I would say that those who object to the line of reasoning that you're putting forward,

375
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,620
I believe would make an argument analogous to the following.

376
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:14,980
They would say, well, look, we have, despite all the objections on the measurement front,

377
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,740
we have pretty good evidence that there's a warming trend.

378
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:22,260
We have reasonable evidence that at least a reasonable proportion of that is a consequence

379
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:27,020
of anthropogenic activity, most particularly the production of carbon dioxide.

380
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:33,540
The potential consequence of this could be apocalyptic 100 years down the road or 50

381
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,500
years down the road.

382
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,380
Even with all those doubts in mind, it's incumbent upon us to take something like emergency

383
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:46,740
action now so that we ameliorate this risk of apocalyptic transformation.

384
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:51,540
And so this is just obstructionist hand waving your objections.

385
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:57,540
And if you were moral and on board, you'd see that this issue is so serious and so apocalyptic

386
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:01,300
that it's inappropriate to stand in the way of the amelioration.

387
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,860
And so what do you think about that as a counter proposition?

388
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:11,100
OK, the weakest part of their argument is whether all this is dangerous.

389
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:15,140
The sea level rise is creeping up.

390
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:24,020
The ice cap, Greenland, Antarctic, it changes from year to year with a little bit of melting,

391
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:28,020
but there's no catastrophe looming on those fronts.

392
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,580
And so they've turned to extreme weather.

393
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,300
Oh, global warming is calling.

394
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:37,420
And I have to say, the hurricane and global warming first put this idea into their head.

395
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:43,740
Ah, you know, if we can show that even one degree can cause something bad, like more

396
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,500
category five hurricanes, then we have something.

397
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:54,220
So this started this whole trend of every extreme weather event is associated with human

398
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,460
cause global warming, which just isn't true.

399
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:04,700
And if you look back, and they tend to go back to 1970 or 1950, oh, this is the warmest

400
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:10,180
year, the worst storm or the biggest drought or whatever since 1970, maybe since 1950.

401
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:17,420
But if you look into the first half of the 20th century, the weather was way worse, certainly

402
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:23,500
in North America and over much of the globe also.

403
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:30,980
Right now in the U.S. West, we're being assaulted by these atmospheric river events, bringing

404
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:39,460
huge amounts of rain and snow, which is going to cause flooding, it's still snow yet.

405
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:44,020
And you know, this is horrible, global warming and everything like that.

406
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:59,220
But if you go back to the winter of 1861 and 1862, 15 inches of rain fell in central California

407
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:05,420
over a period of a couple of months, which huge floods over a very widespread area that

408
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,420
lasted for absolute months.

409
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:14,780
And paleo climate evidence showed that these tend to happen about every 200 years or so,

410
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:18,940
where you have this massive accumulation of these atmospheric rivers.

411
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,780
So this is nothing at all unusual.

412
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:27,540
So if you look back into the historical record or better yet, the paleo climate record, invariably

413
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,660
you will find worse weather events.

414
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:36,060
So that's part of the timeframe problem, right, is like, well, over what span do you evaluate

415
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,500
these events before you draw your conclusions?

416
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,500
But you can't...

417
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,700
So do you believe it?

418
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:46,780
Do you believe that any of the tipping point hypotheses, Franzen told me something interesting.

419
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:49,260
This was kind of a technical proposition.

420
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:54,900
He said that in complex systems with many degrees of freedom on the entropy front, so many ways

421
00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:01,460
they can potentially react, the probability of a tipping point positive feedback loop,

422
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:05,700
you know, like the runaway global warming or something like that, the melting of the

423
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:11,340
Greenland ice caps, because we hit a tipping point, said in complex systems that have multiple

424
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:16,540
potential outcomes, that kind of all or none tipping point is unlikely.

425
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:21,340
You get that more likely in a simple system that's characterized by the probability of

426
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,820
radical state change, like water freezing, for example.

427
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:29,140
And so I thought that I can't evaluate that argument, you know, it's outside my domain

428
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:33,700
of scientific competence, but it struck me as an interesting idea.

429
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:42,140
Well, to some extent, it's true, there is one sort of tipping point that we could encounter,

430
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:48,120
and if this does happen, I would expect that human-caused global warming would play only

431
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:54,660
a small part, and this is the West Antarctic ice sheet, which is an unstable ice sheet.

432
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:58,900
So if you took the ice sheet away, the continent would actually be under water.

433
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:04,500
But what it is, you have this huge ice sheet that sits on the continent and part of it's

434
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:09,220
above water, okay, and it has an overhang.

435
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:16,820
And this is just a dynamically unstable situation, and it moves fairly fast.

436
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:24,780
Underneath this ice sheet are lots of inactive volcanoes, even the occasional active volcanoes.

437
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:29,940
So if these volcanoes became active and we had, you know, a greater heat source under

438
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:39,100
this, combined with sea level rise and a little bit of global warming, this could accelerate.

439
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:45,020
And on the time scale of, you know, three or four centuries, we could see this collapse,

440
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:49,220
you know, which could lead to a substantial sea level rise.

441
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:54,460
So that's the one kind, you know, if we saw that happening, are there engineering ways

442
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,060
of dealing with it?

443
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:02,060
I don't know, but it was something that would be a slow process, but that's the only one

444
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:10,380
of the so-called tipping points that I see could happen, because, you know, if there's

445
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:15,820
going to be some solid earth, you know, if the earth wants to have an earthquake or big

446
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:20,780
volcanic eruption, you know, there aren't a lot of, you know, negative feedbacks in

447
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,780
the earth system to prevent that.

448
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:30,860
So to me, that's the one, like, bad thing that could happen, but it would take centuries.

449
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:35,060
But the other ones, you know, I don't see it.

450
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:40,700
So what do you think, when you look at the IPCC reports now and you look 50 years ahead

451
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:48,140
or 100 years ahead, what would you regard as a credible representation of the so-called

452
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,540
climate science?

453
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:56,700
Do you accept the new IPC prognostications, or do you think the models are so error-ridden

454
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:02,740
that even the hypothesis of one to two degrees warming isn't reliable enough, even though

455
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,940
it's the best we have?

456
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:11,180
Well, the interesting thing is that the IPCC Six Assessment Report, Working Group One,

457
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:15,660
they also sort of rejected the climate models to some extent.

458
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:21,580
They were guided by them in their projections, but they also, you know, defined a plausible

459
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:25,980
range of climate sensitivity and looked at the projections from there.

460
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:31,500
So even the IPCC is stepping back from the global climate models as being useful for

461
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:37,220
projections, and people are going to these climate emulators, these simple climate models.

462
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:43,340
Well, for this amount of warming, you know, run it through a damage model or an economic

463
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,380
assessment model or something like that.

464
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:49,500
So people are really stepping back from these big global climate models, and it's about

465
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,020
time.

466
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:59,340
And one of the innovations that I've been undertaking in my projection work, and this

467
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:06,100
is what I do for clients of my company, Climate Forecast Applications Network, is that I

468
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,260
look at it.

469
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:13,500
I don't just look at the IPCC scenarios, and I choose the low-end ones, because I think

470
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:18,260
those are more credible, but I also look at scenarios of what the ocean circulations

471
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:26,180
could be doing, you know, scenarios of volcanic eruptions and solar variation scenarios and

472
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:31,980
try to put forward a broader range of what we might be looking at.

473
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:37,900
And so I have like a network-based approach to combine all this and to producing a much

474
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,060
broader range of scenarios.

475
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:45,700
And at least over the next three decades, like the natural variability piece of this

476
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:52,260
is pointing towards cooling rather than amplifying the warming, you know, it would tamp down

477
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:58,220
the global warming of whatever magnitude it is from fossil fuel emissions.

478
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,380
So that's the approach that I'm taking.

479
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,540
Okay, so let's go into that a bit.

480
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:11,060
You earlier, you indicated that you left the university in 2017 to pursue an entrepreneurial

481
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:18,260
activity that you had initiated at Georgia Tech, and you just made allusion to that again.

482
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:26,220
So tell me, if you would, how you are modeling, and you've laid out some of the conclusions,

483
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,980
but who's interested in your models?

484
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:33,300
And obviously, you're doing this on an entrepreneurial basis, so people are willing to pay you for

485
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:38,660
your opinion, which gives, I think, some, what would you say, indication of their faith

486
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:44,500
in its credibility, because people are actually spending money on it, like how are your models

487
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:50,460
different than the models that are more broadly publicized, let's say?

488
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:54,180
And who is it that is paying you to produce these models?

489
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,700
Why is there interest in that?

490
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,180
And why are they doing it?

491
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:04,620
Okay, well, insurance companies, financial institutions have an interest in Atlantic

492
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,120
hurricanes.

493
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:11,340
What are we looking at over the next three decades in terms of Atlantic hurricane activity?

494
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:17,660
A big issue is a potential shift to the cold phase of the Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation.

495
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:24,540
This is one of those multi-decadal oscillations that I talked about, which we would expect

496
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:29,700
would start to tamp down the Atlantic hurricane activity.

497
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,780
So this is a very big deal for them.

498
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:39,860
Another client was Wind Farm owners who wanted to know, is the wind going to keep blowing

499
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:43,460
for the next 30 years, and are my wind farms in the right location?

500
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,780
Okay, they wanted to know that.

501
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:54,580
Some electric utilities want to know, what could we be looking at in terms of, like,

502
00:40:54,580 --> 00:41:02,180
how frequent these really bad situations could be for renewable power, like a massive cold

503
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:07,060
air outbreak that lasts for weeks, the wind doesn't blow, and it's wintertime and there's

504
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,780
no sun.

505
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:13,700
How bad can it get, and how frequently might these occur?

506
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:19,380
So these are some of the things that I've been looking at, and also people interested

507
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:27,940
in sea level rise projections in their particular location, looking at scenarios of what their

508
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:28,940
location.

509
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:37,380
A lot of interest from people in Florida, San Francisco, along the Atlantic coast.

510
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,260
What could we be looking at?

511
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:46,740
We see that those projections from the IPCC, which of those should we believe, but we already

512
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:52,140
know that, you know, how are the ocean circulation patterns going to influence their local sea

513
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,860
level rise?

514
00:41:53,860 --> 00:42:06,420
What kind of trends do I see for the vertical land motion, both from local effects and large

515
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:12,700
more planetary scale up and down, kind of effects.

516
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:17,980
So those are some of the projects that I've been working on, looking at scenarios out,

517
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:22,260
say, 30 to 50 years.

518
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,980
If you own a small to medium-sized business that kept employees on payroll through COVID,

519
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,900
you may have a big cash refund waiting for you.

534
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:30,020
So why do these companies believe that your models are credible enough for them to pour

535
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:35,100
economic resources into, and why do you believe that your models are credible enough to provide

536
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,100
them with accurate guidance?

537
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:40,940
I mean, we talked about some of the limitations of models, and so what is it that you're doing

538
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:46,060
that is credible to the companies, and why do you believe scientifically that you're

539
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,740
providing accurate information?

540
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,740
Okay.

541
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:56,660
The first thing that I did, and I did this before most other people did, I said, look,

542
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:01,500
you're wasting your time looking at that extreme emissions scenario.

543
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:10,380
If you look at the international energy agency, their scenarios show emissions being fairly

544
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:17,700
flat for the next several decades, and I think this is a much more plausible scenario.

545
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:24,080
So let's focus on that one, and this is apart from trying to predict what policy is going

546
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:29,400
to do and how much you're going to change, but the thinking is now that emissions are

547
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:36,240
going to stay fairly flat for the next few decades, and I saw this, and I saw the journal

548
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,560
publications, and this is what I was pushing to my client.

549
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:43,760
If you want something realistic, this is what you should be looking at.

550
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:55,480
The other thing is not accepting the extremely high values of climate sensitivity to CO2

551
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,480
doubling.

552
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:02,880
I don't go as low as Richard Linsen does, but I'm certainly on the low end, and I justify

553
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:09,600
why to them, based on publications, including some of my own, why we shouldn't be looking

554
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,360
at these very high sensitivity values.

555
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:20,120
I run it through a range so they can look, but I'm saying, so I give them all the scenarios

556
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,120
they want.

557
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:27,720
I'll give the high emission scenario, I'll give the high climate sensitivity, low climate

558
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:35,200
sensitivity, I'll say my best judgment is that this is what it is, but then I uniquely

559
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:40,920
put in scenarios of the natural variability, and they really like this.

560
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:47,880
They get it, they've seen it, and they understand it's out there, they've just never seen anybody

561
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,080
try to project it before, and I have publications on this.

562
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:56,640
They can parameterize their risk given your plethora of models.

563
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:03,120
Here's the worst case scenario, here's the likely scenario, here's the range, and then

564
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:09,640
they can calculate how to mitigate their risk across those scenarios.

565
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,640
Exactly.

566
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,920
A lot of times they want to know, well, what's the worst case?

567
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,920
What's the worst plausible case?

568
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:22,520
Okay, and so I give them that, and so they have this whole range, okay, so for example,

569
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:30,040
in the wind farm profitability study, I gave them 81 scenarios, different scenarios of

570
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:39,480
how this could play out over the next 30 years, and there was a cluster of scenarios in a

571
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:46,800
certain area, and I say, you might infer that these are the most plausible outcomes

572
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:53,920
because there's multiple different pathways for reaching that, but here's your plausible

573
00:46:53,920 --> 00:47:01,880
worst case, here's your plausible best case, and this gives them some information for making

574
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,640
their decision.

575
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:12,400
So you admit right up front in some sense that there are inputs into your models that

576
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:18,280
are somewhat arbitrary, that you have to decide about, and those might be, for example, your

577
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:25,560
projections of carbon dioxide output, and then you say, given a variety of initial assumptions,

578
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:31,800
here's a variety of outcomes, but a lot of the models tend to converge at this vision,

579
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:36,680
this range of visions, and so if the convergence of multiple models constitutes evidence, which

580
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:42,080
we generally assume it does, then this seems to be the most plausible pathway, right, and

581
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,960
so how does that differ from the IPCC approach?

582
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:50,320
Okay, well, I don't say it's the more, well, first they neglect all the elements of natural

583
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:55,920
variability that I conclude, they're not giving scenarios of volcanic eruptions, they're not

584
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:10,160
giving different scenarios of sun activity, they have a bunch of different scenarios of

585
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:16,680
what the internal ocean variability is doing, but I can anchor it more closely to what the

586
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:22,920
observations are in my own network model in terms of what the plausible trajectories are,

587
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:33,560
so I'm giving them a more plausible trajectory for the ocean oscillations, and generally,

588
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:40,480
going out 30 years, these other scenarios are cooler than the IPCC scenarios.

589
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:48,200
Well, and so, and do they actually point to cooling or just less rapid warming?

590
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:53,440
Some of them go as far as cooling, okay, and others are less rapid warming, and there've

591
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:59,920
been another publications, you never see them publicize, that show for certain combinations

592
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:07,800
of these ocean circulations or volcanic eruptions or solar activity that you could see cooling

593
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:14,600
for a decade or two during the 21st century, that could happen.

594
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:21,640
When the IPCC AR6 did, if you read the fine print deep in the chapters, you'll see these

595
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:30,200
papers referenced and it is acknowledged, but it's not something that you hear in the

596
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:35,000
public debate, it's just this relentless warming that we're going to be seeing.

597
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:43,240
Okay, so that's interesting because the warming advocates are doubtful enough about their

598
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:49,000
own prognostication so that it's no longer appropriate to refer to global warming, you're

599
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,480
supposed to refer to climate change, which I think is a terrible sleight of hand, but

600
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,480
in any case, that's what's happened.

601
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:02,880
But nonetheless, the apocalyptic prognostications are still predicated on this idea of warming.

602
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:08,440
Now your claim is that the consensus that that might be apocalyptic was never there to

603
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:13,720
begin with and the initial estimates of the magnitude of warming were out by about a factor

604
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:20,760
of two, partly because people accepted equally apocalyptic in some sense prognostications

605
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,280
of carbon dioxide output.

606
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:29,880
But then you're taking that further, you're saying that the models are so prone to variability

607
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:35,720
that there is some non-trivial possibility that there'll be a global cooling trend over

608
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,520
the next 30 years instead of a global warming trend.

609
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:44,960
And so in the face of all that, someone might ask themselves, well, if the situation with

610
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:53,040
regards to these models is as uncertain as you suggest, and also it's interesting just

611
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,800
as soon as I decide that financial companies will pay you for your prognostications, which

612
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:04,560
is another form of validation of your opinion, why in the world are we stampeding madly to

613
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:10,480
spend untold, literally trillions of dollars trying to ameliorate a problem that we haven't

614
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,160
properly measured?

615
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,720
Like what's going on here as far as you can tell?

616
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,720
Okay.

617
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:16,720
You have to go back.

618
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:17,720
Okay.

619
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:25,880
The policy cart has been way out in front of the scientific course from the very beginning.

620
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:33,000
In the 1980s, the UN environmental program was looking for something.

621
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,160
We hate capitalism.

622
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,880
We don't like the oil companies.

623
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,000
We like world government, all this kind of thing.

624
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:47,320
And they latched on to the climate change, the CO2 global warming is what it was called

625
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,320
back then.

626
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:54,760
And this ceded the formation of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

627
00:51:54,760 --> 00:52:01,720
And there was a treaty signed by 192 nations in 1992, including the US.

628
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,760
This was before we knew anything.

629
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:11,300
We were to avoid dangerous anthropogenic climate change before we had any idea of any of this.

630
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:20,360
And so this frame, the climate problem, in a very narrow frame, a lot of climate is now

631
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:25,120
caused by CO2 and by definition warming is dangerous.

632
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,400
Why was that such an attractive political hypothesis?

633
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:35,160
Why did politicians decide that in the absence of this stringently produced scientific evidence

634
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:41,200
that the proper place for the world's political community to focus was on the cardinal danger

635
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,320
of global warming that was anthropogenically produced?

636
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:48,360
Like, what the hell is going on there, especially because it's so expensive?

637
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,360
Okay.

638
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,800
Well, people didn't pay much attention to it for decades.

639
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:57,800
I mean, the Kyoto Protocol, a bunch of countries in 1997, a bunch of countries signed on to

640
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,640
reduce their emissions.

641
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:04,040
But even the ones who signed on didn't really reduce their emissions, and of course the US

642
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,440
never signed on.

643
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,200
And reduced its emissions weirdly enough.

644
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,440
So that's pretty funny.

645
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,760
I know.

646
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:17,800
And it wasn't really until the Paris Agreement that they came up with this more voluntary

647
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,320
thing.

648
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:26,240
Then they started phrasing it, and there was a spate of bad weather, big El Nino and stuff

649
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:33,680
like that, that they latched onto this extreme, if we'd just got rid of all this, the weather

650
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,680
would be nicer.

651
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:40,160
We'd get rid of all these floods and droughts and hurricanes and whatever else and heatwaves

652
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,720
that was plaguing humanity.

653
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:47,440
And so people bought that kind of simple argument.

654
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:53,600
And then once, there was a real shift in 2018.

655
00:53:53,600 --> 00:54:00,640
After the Paris Agreement, the rhetoric was climate crisis, climate emergency from the

656
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:08,240
world leaders, the UN, President Obama, Macron, Merkel, all of these leaders saying this.

657
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,600
But in 2018, people started paying attention.

658
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:23,200
And this is when Gretta Thunberg came onto the scene, and she's a remarkable person.

659
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:28,520
She's wrong, a lot of things, but a remarkable person nevertheless.

660
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:34,360
But what she was doing spawned the sunrise movement, extinction, rebellion, all this

661
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,960
kind of stuff.

662
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:42,640
And the journalists amplified this, the climate crisis, the climate emergency.

663
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:48,880
Ten years ago, climate, even ten years ago, climate change was like really a fringe topic.

664
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,600
At journals, now major media outlets have a climate desk, you know, I have a whole team

665
00:54:53,600 --> 00:55:02,800
of journalists and there's huge money going into things like carbon brief, things that

666
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,360
focus specifically on climate change.

667
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,200
And so it's just exploded.

668
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:13,240
And again, there's this social contract between the policy makers, the media and the scientists.

669
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:16,000
It's great for the science, there's nobody.

670
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,560
Ten years ago, people with a PhD in climate science, you know, would be trying to get

671
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,880
a postdoc and whatever.

672
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,320
And now the universities can't even hang onto them.

673
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:30,440
There's so many jobs in the media and the private sector that, you know, this is just

674
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,840
a hot thing.

675
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:38,560
Every university now has some sort of climate-y department, institute.

676
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,240
It's just big business for everybody.

677
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:46,240
And so there's this mutual reinforcement between the scientists, the policy makers and the media.

678
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,800
So that's where the positive feedback loops are, from the tipping point.

679
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,120
Right, they're on the sociological side.

680
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,680
Yeah, definitely, definitely.

681
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,200
Yeah, well, it's quite something to behold.

682
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:00,240
So now what has been the consequences?

683
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,680
I mean, you've been pilloried, I believe, I don't believe I'm overstating this, you've

684
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:10,480
been pilloried or satirized as a sort of fringe figure on the client denial front.

685
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,560
I think that's fair to say.

686
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:18,600
And it's pretty easy to smear someone with tactics like that, and it's psychologically

687
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,600
very effective.

688
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:25,280
I mean, what has it, you know, you said you rose to public prominence partly because you

689
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:30,720
formulated an argument, at least to begin with, that could be latched onto by the climate

690
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,520
apocalypse, and quite effectively.

691
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:41,600
But then you produced all sorts of other material, mitigating, producing a mitigated view.

692
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:45,600
What's been the consequence for you of being involved in this?

693
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:51,200
Okay, let me tell you what my sin was.

694
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,640
People don't object to my science.

695
00:56:53,640 --> 00:57:00,360
I mean, I'm within, you know, the likely range of the IPCC for the most part on the

696
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,360
low end.

697
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:08,240
But, you know, it's not fringe perspectives, and I commonly cite the IPCC.

698
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:15,120
What happened, the reason I was shuffled off into denier camp is because I criticized

699
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:18,320
the behavior of climate scientists.

700
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:26,160
I criticized the IPCC for some ethical violations, as well as not paying enough attention to

701
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,160
uncertainty.

702
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,880
So that was my sin, okay?

703
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:35,560
I offended and criticized the grand poobahs of the climate community.

704
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:43,720
And then I was very quick, and most importantly, in 2011, I criticized Michael Mann's hockey

705
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:50,200
stick on my blog, and then he started calling me a denier, and that was really the beginning

706
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,200
of the end.

707
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,200
So my sin...

708
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,840
Yeah, so let's talk about that terminology for a second, just so everybody knows.

709
00:57:55,840 --> 00:58:02,240
So this is quite the rhetorical move on the part of the climate purveyors of apocalyptic

710
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,240
doom.

711
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:08,840
And so we already established in our society, broadly speaking in the West, that to object

712
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:14,160
to the idea that the Holocaust was a historical reality puts you outside the pale of normative

713
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,760
and reasonable political discussion.

714
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:21,800
And so you can be a Holocaust denier, and if you are such a creature, then you're lumped

715
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:26,560
in with the Nazis and put on the shelf for no further contact, right?

716
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,800
You've entered the realm of the reprehensible.

717
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:33,440
Now one of the most effective rhetorical moves of the people who are making a great living

718
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:39,320
or putting themselves forward morally as climate apocalyptic doomsayers was to target

719
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:44,680
people who objected to their views with terminology that was derived directly from that rhetorical

720
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,680
move.

721
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:51,080
So now if you're a climate change denier, the connotation is you're occupied the same

722
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:57,240
category morally as people who refuse to believe on the grounds of their appalling anti-Semitism

723
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:02,200
and their blind historical ignorance that the Holocaust was a historical reality.

724
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:07,040
And so in some sense, there's no real difference between labeling someone a climate change

725
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,880
denier and labeling them a Nazi enabler.

726
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,360
And the rhetorical move was designed precisely to produce that outcome.

727
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:17,120
And so I'm not a big fan of that kind of rhetorical move.

728
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:21,200
And let's talk about Michael Mann for a second too now, because a lot of people listening

729
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,720
and watching, they're not going to know what that hockey stick graph was.

730
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:30,200
And they don't know what cardinal role, the scandal around that graph has produced in

731
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,200
the discussion.

732
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,760
Do you want to walk through the hockey stick graph a little bit?

733
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:34,760
Okay.

734
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:43,440
If you go back to 2001, this was the release of the third assessment report from the IPCC.

735
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:49,320
And Sir John Houghton, who was the head of the IPCC, was giving the press release.

736
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:56,920
And the backdrop behind him was this image, a curve that looked like a hockey stick, which

737
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:02,760
was meant to portray that the climate was very stable for the last thousand years.

738
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:10,840
And all of a sudden, you've got this big uptick that is caused by humans.

739
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:16,640
And this was based on the work of Michael Mann, who was a recent PhD.

740
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,520
This was his postdoc work.

741
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:27,200
Before the ink was dry on his PhD, he was appointed a lead author of the IPCC, which

742
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:31,200
was a fairly unusual move to appoint someone.

743
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,400
That's an insane move.

744
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,760
Let me let everybody watching and listening know.

745
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:42,840
Your PhD is putting your foot or your toe in the water of scientific endeavor.

746
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:50,320
So Judith has 190 publications, and just so those of you who are listening know, generally

747
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:55,920
speaking, a PhD thesis requires approximately as much work as three scientific publications

748
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,600
if it's a high quality PhD.

749
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:05,600
And so when you get your PhD, you've entered the domain of genuine scientific contribution.

750
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,720
The PhD is actually a marker of that.

751
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:13,080
And if you do a postdoc, that means that you have the opportunity to do a little bit more

752
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:18,200
research work to establish your credibility now as a more independent researcher who isn't

753
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,960
dependent on the ideas of your supervisor.

754
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,080
So you're a neophyte.

755
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,960
You're a beginner when you do a PhD and a postdoc.

756
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:29,280
And maybe you have to do one or maybe two, and then maybe you can get hired as a junior

757
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,280
professor.

758
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,320
But you're by no means at the peak of your career.

759
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:38,640
And it's very, very rare for initiatory research that might be done at the PhD level to be

760
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:45,240
regarded as canonical unless you're a Nobel Prize-winning genius by the scientific community.

761
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:50,000
And so the fact that man's work got so much attention, even though it was done at this

762
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,480
initial level of scientific investigation, I mean, that doesn't speak to its validity.

763
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,880
But my point is it's an aberration in the process.

764
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:01,000
And it also points to this problem we discussed earlier of timeframe.

765
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,640
I mean, when you construct graphs, you can play with their psychological impact in all

766
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,440
sorts of inappropriate ways.

767
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:11,320
You can expand and contract the timeframe.

768
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:14,920
You can expand and contract the scale on the left.

769
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:20,400
And you can make what's really a small effect across some historical span of time look big

770
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,680
by playing with the scale.

771
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:29,120
And you can make an effect that isn't very large, temporally speaking, by shrinking the

772
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,720
timescale of evaluation.

773
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:38,520
So the man's graph showed this uptick in climate transformation that was attendant on human

774
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:39,960
industrial activity.

775
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:46,600
But he picked a very narrow timeframe and a very particularized scale so that this maximized

776
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,320
the psychological impact of the graph.

777
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:52,080
And so, but that does bring us to this problem of timescale.

778
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,600
It's like, well, and variability.

779
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:58,000
How much has things changed over 10,000 years?

780
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,560
Like what's the right timescale here?

781
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,200
And that's a very difficult problem.

782
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:13,080
Well, the issues of the hockey stick were not so much that the trigger, the hockey stick

783
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:17,400
trigger, the important one is around 2000.

784
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:24,240
Right after that, this was viewed by a mining engineer, Steve McIntyre said, hockey stick,

785
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,080
hockey stick, I've seen these things.

786
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:29,800
This is usually a con game trying to get somebody to buy mining stocks.

787
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:33,680
He says, you know, then he got intrigued, he wanted to look at the data.

788
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,440
So he asked for the data, they gave him some of it.

789
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:44,960
And he and Ross McKittrick, Canadian economics professor, took a look at this and they found

790
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:50,840
all sorts of errors, you know, mishandling of data, inappropriate statistical methods

791
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,600
on and on it goes.

792
01:03:52,600 --> 01:04:00,440
And man went after these guys big time rather than, you know, constructively trying to deal

793
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,960
with these criticisms.

794
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:08,360
He went after these guys and this turned into a pretty big flame war.

795
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:13,840
And then McIntyre and McKittrick published two additional papers in 2005.

796
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:17,560
And the controversy, you know, was just explosive.

797
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:21,880
There were congressional hearings on this and on and on it went.

798
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:25,280
So it was this huge controversy.

799
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:34,080
And these Climategate emails that were released in 2009 revealed all sorts of skull-dudgery,

800
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:42,040
you know, trying to keep data away from McIntyre and McKittrick, trying to put pressure on

801
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:46,960
journal editors not to publish their papers and on and on it goes.

802
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:52,760
And, you know, and so this was revealed in Climategate.

803
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:57,360
So those were more egregious sins than just picking a convenient timeframe and a convenient

804
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:58,360
scale.

805
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:59,360
Oh, yeah, yeah.

806
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:06,560
But there is a graphical issue and this was the theme of my blog post, Hiding the Decline.

807
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:11,440
So the Paleo climate record just, you know, showed these little oscillations and to get

808
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:20,120
that sort of hockey stick piece, they spliced on the observational record on top of that.

809
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:25,680
And it wasn't clear in the IPCC report that was that was done.

810
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:31,200
It was sort of in some sort of a footnote or an obscure reference, but it never occurred

811
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:35,680
to me as someone in the field that this is what had been done.

812
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,480
So no, I don't understand that.

813
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,480
Go into that more detail.

814
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:41,160
I don't understand exactly what was done there.

815
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:42,160
Okay.

816
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,160
You see the handle?

817
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,160
Okay.

818
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:49,920
If you look at the actual tree ring rate data that went into their analysis, it was just

819
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:53,000
like the flat handle.

820
01:05:53,000 --> 01:06:00,720
In order to get the blade, the uptick of the blade, they spliced on the historical temperature

821
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,480
record, completely different data set.

822
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,320
Oh, oh, I see.

823
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:10,040
Because the tree rings weren't showing this uptick.

824
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:14,280
This is a so-called hide the decline.

825
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:21,800
And so, you know, to me, this is something without doing that is a bad idea, but doing

826
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:30,920
that without explaining it is marginal and this is known in some circles subsequently

827
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:34,240
would be given a label as image fraud.

828
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:40,560
And so this is what I wrote my blog post about and I wasn't particularly attacking man because

829
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:49,720
he wasn't the only person involved in this little deception, but, you know, this got

830
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:56,080
a lot of attention and apparently Michael Mann was unhappy and pretty soon after that,

831
01:06:56,080 --> 01:07:00,280
you know, he was calling me a denier on Twitter and then I started appearing on all these

832
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:10,040
misinformer lists and by 2012, you know, I was firmly established as a denier and the

833
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:17,560
society of environmental journalists put together a list, a description of all the climate blogs.

834
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:24,480
And my blog was under the list of denier blogs and the description says, unlike most other

835
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:27,400
denier blogs, Currie is a real scientist.

836
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:34,360
She looks at both sides of the issues, digs deep into the issues, discusses the uncertainties

837
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:38,960
and all this other stuff and I said, well, that's a beautiful description of my blog,

838
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:44,040
but why did they accept prima facie that my blog is a denier blog?

839
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:49,280
I mean, it just shows how pervasive and how stupid this whole thing was.

840
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,840
So I, you know, I got tossed into the denier camp.

841
01:07:52,840 --> 01:08:03,040
I don't align myself with either side, you know, I, I, I preciously fought for my independence,

842
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:06,400
which included resigning my academic position.

843
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:13,520
So you know, I think for myself, I think deep, I look at the evidence, make judgments.

844
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:19,080
And it's mostly about trying to better characterize uncertainties and what we don't know.

845
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:25,400
This is a key part of rational policymaking is to understand the uncertainties and what

846
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:28,600
we don't know.

847
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,440
We'll be back in one moment.

848
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:34,880
First we wanted to give you a sneak peek at Jordan's new series, Exodus.

849
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:44,760
So the Hebrews created history as we know it.

850
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,320
You don't get away with anything.

851
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:49,920
And so you might think you can bend the fabric of reality and that you can treat people

852
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,760
instrumentally and that you can bow to the tyrant and violate your conscience without

853
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,760
cost.

854
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:55,760
You will pay the piper.

855
01:08:55,760 --> 01:09:00,120
It's going to call you out of that slavery into freedom, even if that pulls you into

856
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:01,120
the desert.

857
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:09,000
And we're going to see that there's something else going on here that is far more cosmic

858
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,480
and deeper than what you can imagine.

859
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:19,760
The highest ethical spirit to which we're beholden is presented precisely as that spirit

860
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:24,000
that allies itself with the cause of freedom against tyranny.

861
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Yes, it's that hope.

862
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
And there is that hope.

863
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
I want villains to get punished.

864
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,280
But do you want the villains to learn before they have to pay the ultimate price?

865
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:31,680
That's such a Christian question.

866
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:48,240
Well, we've got a threefold problem here by the sounds of things in some real sense.

867
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:53,560
I mean, the first problem is kind of a positive feedback loop that you alluded to, is that

868
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:56,880
a lot of attention was paid to this potential issue.

869
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:00,880
A lot of money was put into funding investigation into it.

870
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:05,800
That incentivized the growth of a huge scientific enterprise.

871
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:10,520
That incentivized people who were primarily motivated by the money, including the grants.

872
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:15,080
And I mean, it's hard not to be motivated by that if you want to be a practicing scientist.

873
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:22,240
And so there was a lot of financial and practical pressure to produce an environmentally apocalyptic

874
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:23,560
story.

875
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:28,560
And then you could imagine that it's amplified by the fact that reporting that there's no

876
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:33,160
problem on the climate front is not something that's going to produce an attention grabbing

877
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:41,600
headline, especially in the era of declining attention being paid to legacy media outlets.

878
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:46,720
And so we know perfectly well that human beings are much more sensitive to negative information

879
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:52,720
comparatively speaking than to positive information and that you can attract attention with a story

880
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:57,520
of gloom and threat much more effectively than one that states there's no story here

881
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,960
at all or something positive.

882
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:00,960
So that's a big problem.

883
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:07,360
And then the third problem I would say is that it's easy for venal and narcissistic politicians,

884
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:14,760
and that's not all of them, to latch on to a convenient money generating apocalyptic nightmare

885
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:20,200
to put themselves forward as white knights on the moral front and to pull the wool over

886
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:24,240
the eyes and maybe even their own eyes in relationship to whether or not they're making

887
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,680
any practical progress in the actual world.

888
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:33,480
And so there is a situation where we have a set of positive feedback loops operating

889
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:38,160
in sociological space that are producing a kind of chicken little outcome.

890
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:43,760
And so we're running around claiming that the sky is falling and dumping, tilting our

891
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:48,560
economic systems in a dangerous direction and spending untold hundreds of billions of

892
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:54,960
dollars addressing a problem that is ill defined and likely nowhere nearer of the magnitude

893
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,920
that we think it is.

894
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:02,920
And so, and then I want to follow that with a, I tried to make a strong case for why you

895
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:08,560
might be regarded with a certain degree of apprehension from the perspective of the climate

896
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,560
apocalypse, but I'm also curious about this.

897
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:18,120
The piece of data that has really emerged as most striking to me on the environmental

898
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:24,880
front over the last 20 years is the recent observations, they've been going on for about

899
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:33,200
five years or 10 years perhaps, that one of the consequences of extra carbon dioxide output

900
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:41,000
is that the planet has greened 15% since the dawn of the millennia and that most of that

901
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:46,600
greening has taken place in what would have otherwise been semi-arid and rather denuded

902
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,400
areas.

903
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:56,720
And so I don't see a statistic on the anti-carbon front that's as powerful negatively as the

904
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:02,160
statistic that the planet is 15% greener and that our crops are also in a consequence

905
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:06,080
quite a lot more productive on the pro-carbon dioxide front.

906
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:10,880
So you made the claim earlier that maybe we're in for a period of cooling, that's within

907
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:15,240
the error predictions of the models, but I would like to say, well, why shouldn't I

908
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:21,040
look at the fact that the planet has got 15% greener in 15 years, that's an area bigger

909
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:26,680
than the United States and say, well, why are we so sure that carbon dioxide output is

910
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:28,760
a bad thing at all?

911
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:33,880
I mean, some of the people who initially hypothesized about the greenhouse effect were quite effusive

912
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:38,800
in their predictions that this would produce a greener, more lush and more productive world,

913
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,520
a more habitable world.

914
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:46,880
So is it unreasonable to put that forward as a proposition?

915
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:56,440
Again, the apocalypse types are pushing extreme weather events as being caused by warming.

916
01:13:56,440 --> 01:14:02,720
The hurricanes, the Pakistan flooding, the heat waves, unusual this, that, and the other.

917
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:07,240
This is what they're pushing as being caused by warming.

918
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:16,720
It's conceivable that there is some element of contribution from fossil-fueled warming

919
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:24,120
to this, but it's because of the large amount of natural weather and climate variability,

920
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:26,200
it's impossible to discern.

921
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:32,760
I mean, if we were to immediately stop emitting fossil fuels, we probably wouldn't notice

922
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:39,120
any change in the weather throughout the rest of the 21st century.

923
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:45,480
So this is the key error in logic that people have been made.

924
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:48,960
Well, I mean, it's not an error in logic.

925
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:54,840
It's a very effective selling point for the alarmist, but people have bought it and people

926
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,120
have weather amnesia.

927
01:14:56,120 --> 01:15:02,720
I mean, if you just look back to the 1950s to the 1930s or whatever, the weather was

928
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:07,360
much worse, certainly in North America.

929
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:11,320
So it's just something that doesn't make sense.

930
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:15,880
Does that mean we should just keep amping up the fossil-fuel emissions?

931
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:22,080
No, we just really don't quite understand the consequences of this, but neither does

932
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:33,800
it imply that we should urgently reduce emissions and disrupt the global energy systems that

933
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:41,240
will make people less off and less well off and more vulnerable to whatever extreme weather

934
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:44,680
and climate events might happen to occur.

935
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:49,440
So we're hurting ourselves, but we're not doing much in the way of reducing emissions

936
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:57,920
anyways, and we're just making ourselves less prosperous and more vulnerable to extreme

937
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,080
weather events.

938
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:05,320
Well, OK, so there's two consequences of that, I would say, is the first is if we do make

939
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:09,880
people less well off by making energy much more expensive, by restricting fossil-fuel

940
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:15,680
use like unreasonably, let's say, or by not pursuing nuclear power, for example, as an

941
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:17,000
alternative.

942
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,280
The major consequence of that will be that a lot of poor people who are right on the

943
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:27,880
edge and there's lots of them are poorer than they need to be and will be off the edge.

944
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:32,160
And the consequence of that is, as you already pointed out, that if anything untoward does

945
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:35,760
happen on the weather front, they're going to be much more vulnerable to that.

946
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:42,360
I mean, distinguishing between infrastructure inadequacy and weather catastrophe is very,

947
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,360
very difficult.

948
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:49,760
Even when Katrina hit New Orleans, you could say that it was a natural disaster.

949
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:54,520
But you could also say it was an abject failure of planning, because the Army Corps of Engineer

950
01:16:54,520 --> 01:17:01,520
Dykes were only designed to withstand a one-in-a-hundred-year storm, whereas when the Dutch built Dykes, they designed

951
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:04,760
them to withstand a one-in-ten-thousand-year storm.

952
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:08,880
So whether that was a natural disaster or a consequence of human foolishness is not

953
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,640
precisely obvious.

954
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:13,360
And the same thing applies on the energy front.

955
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:19,560
If we impoverish the already poor by making energy expensive, not only do we expose them

956
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:25,000
to much more risk to life and limb, let's say, and property, but we also decrease the

957
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,040
probability that those self-same people are going to be able to take an environmentally

958
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:35,160
oriented view, because the data indicates that if you can get people up to producing

959
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:42,240
or benefiting from economic growth to the tune of about $5,000 a year in average GDP,

960
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:47,240
then they start to take a medium to long-term view of the future and start to attend much

961
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:51,320
more carefully to what you might describe as environmental concerns.

962
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:56,600
So panicking about climate in the way that we're doing, if the consequence is to raise

963
01:17:56,600 --> 01:18:01,400
energy prices and impoverish people, looks like it's going to kill more people first

964
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,120
because they'll be more vulnerable.

965
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:07,960
And second, that it's going to make, it's going to deliver as far fewer people who are

966
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:13,560
capable of taking the kind of medium to long-term view of sustainability that would be actually

967
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:17,520
beneficial to producing a more livable planet.

968
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:20,440
And I still want to ask your opinion about the greening.

969
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,920
Yeah, the greening's happening.

970
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:28,840
I think it's attributed mostly to carbon dioxide, but also more rainfall and warmer temperatures

971
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:31,360
in help.

972
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:41,320
So the greening is definitely a benefit that the greening is happening over a big portion

973
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:44,080
of the globe, actually.

974
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:48,200
So it's clearly a benefit.

975
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:53,720
Well, it's also so perverse, because one of the, it's perverse is the fact that the Americans

976
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:57,440
decreased their carbon output by returning to fracking.

977
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:58,680
Nobody predicted that.

978
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:04,840
But here we have a situation where not only is the planet not getting browner and drier,

979
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:11,120
which was the apocalyptic vision, but many of the areas that were really brown and dry,

980
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:17,120
like the southern edge of the Sahara Desert, are actually seeing the ingress of vegetation

981
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:21,880
in a manner that's, well, unprecedented even up to 15 years ago.

982
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:28,640
And so not only is that not what was predicted, it's the very opposite of what's predicted.

983
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:35,800
And it's the opposite in a very, very massive manner.

984
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:40,680
I mean, 15% increase in greening is just, it's almost beyond comprehension.

985
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:45,200
As I said, that's an area bigger than the continental United States.

986
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:49,200
And then to say as well that that's also produced quite an increment in the productivity of

987
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:53,120
human crops and enabled us to grow more food in less area.

988
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:57,520
So like, those are facts that need to be taken with dead seriousness.

989
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,240
They're very positive, perhaps.

990
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:04,360
I mean, you could argue that maybe that rate of vegetation change brings with it threats

991
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:07,720
that we haven't yet envisioned, and that could be the case.

992
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:13,120
But nonetheless, this, it certainly isn't the spreading of the deserts that we were

993
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,440
led to be apprehensive of.

994
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,240
Well, that's correct.

995
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:25,920
Again, the framing of this going back to 1992 was around dangerous anthropogenic interference

996
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,440
in the climate system.

997
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:29,880
So the focus was on dangers.

998
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:31,240
They were looking for dangers.

999
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:40,360
The benefits, you know, weren't even acknowledged until maybe the fifth assessment report in

1000
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:41,360
the IPCC.

1001
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:47,160
I mean, everything, they were just looking for dangers, that there was no counterweight

1002
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:48,240
of the benefits.

1003
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:49,240
So.

1004
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:50,240
Right.

1005
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:51,240
Right.

1006
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:52,240
And no cost benefit analysis.

1007
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:54,400
I mean, I've talked to Bjorn Lomburg a lot.

1008
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,400
Yeah.

1009
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:59,320
The reason I went after that was that I looked through all the data that you're describing

1010
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,160
for a long period of time.

1011
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:05,760
One of the things that struck me, and struck me as well about the multiplicity of goals

1012
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:11,240
that the UN was hypothetically pursuing, was that no one was assessing these risks

1013
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:15,280
and benefits in any systematic manner, ranking them.

1014
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:19,800
And then I came across Lomburg's work, and he tried to do a cost benefit analysis, looking

1015
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:25,640
at our capacity to adapt and ranking the problems that face us in terms of their severity

1016
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:29,520
and also what we could do about those problems in some effective manner.

1017
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:36,040
And like Lomburg, like you, accepts the IPCC prognostications of a mild warming trend

1018
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:41,520
over the next hundred years, but he's done calculations showing that the net consequence

1019
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:47,200
of that, even if it is somewhat detrimental economically, if we factor all those costs

1020
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:53,040
into account, is that we'll be less, more rich than we would otherwise be, right?

1021
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:58,400
Because our GDP is going to increase something like 400% on average in the next hundred

1022
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:03,560
years, and one of the negative consequences of global warming will be that it'll be slightly

1023
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:06,000
less than 400%.

1024
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,720
And that it's clear that we can manage that in any real sense, and that we're very good

1025
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:16,520
at adapting to a huge range of weather situations and climate scenarios.

1026
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:20,880
Some of us live in damn near Arctic conditions, and other people live in the desert.

1027
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:26,000
And so it's not outside the realm of human adaptation to adapt to a one or two degree

1028
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,840
climate transformation.

1029
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:32,560
And animals should be able to do the same, assuming that we're reasonably intelligent

1030
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,560
on the environmental conservation front.

1031
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:40,240
And so, I don't know, are you aware of Lomburg's work?

1032
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,240
What do you think of-

1033
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:49,080
Oh, yeah, no, Bjorn and I are in close contact, and I'm very well aware of what he's doing,

1034
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:53,080
and he's doing a very good job of making those points.

1035
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:58,520
The thing that, you know, the UN has the 17 sustainability goals.

1036
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:03,760
I think the first one is to eliminate poverty.

1037
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,600
The second one is to eliminate hunger.

1038
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:16,520
The number seven is energy, affordable energy for all, and the number 13 is climate action.

1039
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:21,800
And you've got to wonder, how did climate action, even one piece of that, which is elimination

1040
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:31,640
of fossil fuels, come to Trump, elimination of poverty and elimination of hunger?

1041
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:38,520
Climate aid from the UN, from the World Bank and whatever is now focused on mitigation,

1042
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:43,880
the traditional objectives of economic development and help with adaptation.

1043
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:49,480
Those are put on the back burner in favor of mitigation.

1044
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:56,240
And this is making people less well off, and we're squandering opportunities for human

1045
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:57,240
development.

1046
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:06,000
You know, for senseless objectives that aren't expected to improve anyone's life over the

1047
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,360
course of the 21st century and could very well make us all worse off.

1048
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:17,080
Okay, so this is part of the incomprehensibility of this to me, because it looks to me like

1049
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:24,040
a lot of the arguments, for example, that would force us to take the apocalyptic prognostications

1050
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:25,680
of the doomsayer seriously.

1051
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:32,600
The moral arguments go something like this, well, you know, a hundred years if there's

1052
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:37,400
a lot of climate change, it's primarily going to be the world's poor who pay the largest

1053
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:40,200
price for that, the world's poor and oppressed.

1054
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:46,000
And to mitigate against that, we have to adopt policies that however painful they are in

1055
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:51,520
the short term, will mitigate against that because of our concern for the long term viability

1056
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:54,760
of, let's say, these poverty-stricken people.

1057
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:59,000
But the problem with that is that the models aren't very reliable, and it's absolutely

1058
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:04,280
100% certain that if we raise energy prices, which we have been doing quite effectively,

1059
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:10,080
and food prices, we're going to make life much more difficult for impoverished people throughout

1060
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:12,120
the developing world right now.

1061
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:16,000
And in a way that's going to kill plenty of people, and it's certainly going to deprive

1062
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:21,500
many others of educational opportunity and nutritional, optimal nutritional input and

1063
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:25,340
all of that, 100% certain that's going to occur.

1064
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:31,860
But the moral aspect is, well, we shouldn't be doing things that would endanger those

1065
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:34,180
people who are oppressed and poor.

1066
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:37,900
But the policies we're pursuing do precisely that.

1067
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:43,940
So again, I'm still left with this complete incapacity to understand how this can possibly

1068
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:45,100
be the case.

1069
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:49,580
I don't get it because there's lots of other things we could be doing.

1070
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:54,180
Well, leaders in Africa are quite outspoken.

1071
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:57,700
They're on the front lines of being the victims of all this.

1072
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:06,820
They refer to green colonialism, energy apartheid that they're facing over this global warming

1073
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:07,820
policies.

1074
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:08,940
Right, right, right.

1075
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:14,220
And they can't get loans from development banks to build.

1076
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:20,820
They have plenty of fossil natural gas, coal, a lot of fossil fuel resources in Africa.

1077
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:26,380
They can't get loans to build their own power plants.

1078
01:26:26,380 --> 01:26:32,340
The only thing that they're able to do is sell their fuel to Europe.

1079
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:40,500
So Europe is exploiting them doubly by taking their fuel, but not allowing it.

1080
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:46,300
It's politically incorrect for these banks to fund the development of power plants.

1081
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:50,220
So the Africans can develop their own economy.

1082
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:51,220
It's just evil.

1083
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:55,700
And I think green colonialism and energy apartheid are perfect descriptors for what's

1084
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:56,700
going on.

1085
01:26:56,700 --> 01:27:03,820
Well, it's just, again, it leaves me open mouthed in amazement that we in the developed

1086
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:09,740
world with our functional economies and our high level of luxury and security can say

1087
01:27:09,940 --> 01:27:14,660
to developing worlds, the developing world, well, you know, we've got it pretty good here

1088
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:16,940
and we're probably willing to cut back a little bit.

1089
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:21,820
But you guys down there in the developing countries, you know, you should be pretty damn careful

1090
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:25,780
about your carbon output because, you know, we've only got one planet.

1091
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:29,460
And so it isn't really obvious that any of you should have the same kind of benefits

1092
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:30,460
that we have.

1093
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:33,700
The planet can't sustain that level of luxury and security.

1094
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:37,180
And so we're just not going to let you have any money.

1095
01:27:37,180 --> 01:27:41,420
We're not going to help you develop your economy so that you can benefit from the same industrial

1096
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:48,020
revolution that has enabled us to educate our children and to have plenty to eat and

1097
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:50,620
to be warm in the winter and cool in the summer.

1098
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:55,660
And then what's even more preposterous is it's the very people who are constantly clamoring

1099
01:27:55,660 --> 01:28:02,460
about the oppressive nature of Western culture who are foisting this very story on these

1100
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:03,820
developed countries.

1101
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:11,780
Yeah, the irony is that even if the African nations were given, you know, the carbon credits

1102
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:17,780
or whatever and allowed to develop to where they want to be and where anyone expects them

1103
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:24,260
to be, at most they would be emitting like five or six percent of global emissions.

1104
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:28,940
And this is for like a billion people in the population.

1105
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:35,220
So we're not talking about a lot of extra emissions to allow them to develop.

1106
01:28:35,220 --> 01:28:37,900
I mean, it just makes absolutely no sense.

1107
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:39,220
And it's evil.

1108
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:40,220
It's absolutely evil.

1109
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:42,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1110
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:43,580
That's how it looks to me too.

1111
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:49,500
Well, I'm glad to hear that you regard Lomborg as a credible commentator on such things.

1112
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:55,540
Well, you know, I've looked across a wide variety of political and scientific thinkers over

1113
01:28:55,620 --> 01:29:01,980
a 20-year period trying to identify people that I believe to be credible on the interface

1114
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:06,940
between economic development and energy and environmental management.

1115
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:10,220
And I like Schellenberger.

1116
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:13,500
I think Eppstein has some interesting things to say.

1117
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:17,620
I like Marion Tupi.

1118
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:19,740
What's the English?

1119
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:21,740
What's his name?

1120
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:22,740
Richard Tull.

1121
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:23,740
Matt Ridley.

1122
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:24,740
I think Ridley is good.

1123
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:25,740
Yeah, yeah.

1124
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:29,900
And so, but of all those people, I think Lomborg has done the most credible job.

1125
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:32,540
And he's also been given a damn rough ride in the media.

1126
01:29:32,540 --> 01:29:38,140
I mean, he's doing pretty well now, I think, promoting his message, which is such a lovely,

1127
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:42,580
what he lays out is such a lovely scenario, because he shows how much good we could do

1128
01:29:42,580 --> 01:29:47,500
in the world, especially with regard to the amelioration of absolute poverty and the provision

1129
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:52,860
of education, at such a tiny fraction of the amounts of money that are being devoted to

1130
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:58,180
this insane prevention of a non-existent climate apocalypse.

1131
01:29:58,180 --> 01:30:03,220
And I've been doing everything I can for whatever it's worth to draw attention to his work.

1132
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:10,260
But the fact that he's been pilloried, like you've been pilloried, makes it, well, there's

1133
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:12,340
always a question lurking in the back of my mind.

1134
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:14,940
It's sort of like, well, where there's smoke, there's fire.

1135
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:19,180
If people are constantly being attacked for their views on moral grounds, maybe there's

1136
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:20,300
something to that.

1137
01:30:20,660 --> 01:30:25,380
I certainly, I haven't been able to find that my analysis of your work, or Franzen's.

1138
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:30,380
I certainly have seen none of that whatsoever in relationship to Lomborg.

1139
01:30:30,380 --> 01:30:33,340
So the mystery still remains for me.

1140
01:30:33,340 --> 01:30:40,700
Okay, they went after Lomborg early on, you know, 2003, whatever, following his book,

1141
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:43,180
The Skeptical Environmentalist.

1142
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:55,060
The issue was that he didn't regard the reduction of fossil fuel emissions as the be all and

1143
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:56,060
end all.

1144
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:59,100
There were more important things to do.

1145
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:01,380
And for that, he got labeled.

1146
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:06,460
That was a very dangerous perspective, because they were just so set on this one particular

1147
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:16,940
policy for reasons, for poorly justified reasons, and for reasons that became harder

1148
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:20,100
to justify as time went on.

1149
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:22,380
And they're still stuck on this.

1150
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:28,340
And it just defies logic, and it's going to cause a lot of damage in the world.

1151
01:31:28,340 --> 01:31:32,100
It defies logic unless your primary goal is easy moral virtue.

1152
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:36,540
So imagine, you know, the problem with Lomborg's work fundamentally, and this is the problem

1153
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:42,340
with marketing it too, is that he offers a multivariate and multidimensional analysis

1154
01:31:42,340 --> 01:31:44,180
of the problems besetting the world.

1155
01:31:44,180 --> 01:31:47,820
He says, well, we don't just have one problem, climate apocalypse.

1156
01:31:47,820 --> 01:31:53,700
We have like 100 problems, and then we have the problem of how to rank order these problems.

1157
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:58,300
And then we have the problem of generating actual solutions and assessing them.

1158
01:31:58,340 --> 01:32:03,060
And that's actually requires a lot of cognitive effort, you know, to walk through those.

1159
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:09,780
And so, but where if you're a climate apocalypse, you can reduce the entire panoply of human

1160
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:15,260
problems to one problem, and then you can put yourself forward as a moral person by

1161
01:32:15,260 --> 01:32:19,700
just saying, well, I'm definitely concerned about the fate of the planet.

1162
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:22,780
And that's all anybody reasonable should be concerned about.

1163
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:29,580
And because I'm concerned in that manner, I'm a fully credible and reputationly remarkable

1164
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:30,580
person.

1165
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:35,700
And that's part of the psychological proclivity that is behind this.

1166
01:32:35,700 --> 01:32:36,700
Okay.

1167
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:42,500
And so everything bad that happens, someone finds a path to blame it on climate change.

1168
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:43,500
Okay.

1169
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:44,500
Yeah.

1170
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:45,900
And the media amplifies it.

1171
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:48,500
And this gives politicians an easy out.

1172
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:55,620
So rather than dealing with their real problems, you know, poor land use, poor regulations,

1173
01:32:55,620 --> 01:33:02,900
poor whatever inadequate infrastructure, whatever might be the cause of their actual problems,

1174
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:05,260
they simply blame it on global warming.

1175
01:33:05,260 --> 01:33:07,420
And so that gives them an easy out.

1176
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:08,420
Yeah.

1177
01:33:08,420 --> 01:33:12,420
I read an article yesterday that climate change was increasing the risk that women were being

1178
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:13,660
abused in their homes.

1179
01:33:13,660 --> 01:33:18,460
That was just a classic example, you know, and I mean, you know, you can't just say

1180
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:22,740
you can make the case that whatever produces economic instability is going to raise the

1181
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:28,180
roots, you know, the rates of abuse, but to link it directly to climate change is a really

1182
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:31,340
egregious example of exactly the kind of thing that you're describing.

1183
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:32,340
All right.

1184
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:35,100
Well, look, we're out of time on this segment.

1185
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:39,780
I'm going to talk to Dr. Curry for an additional half an hour on the Daily Wire Plus platform

1186
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:41,500
for those of you who are watching and listening.

1187
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:42,500
You might be interested in that.

1188
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:47,220
I'm going to talk about the development of her interest in her scientific endeavors

1189
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:50,980
and in her entrepreneurial endeavors as well.

1190
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:51,980
Hello everyone.

1191
01:33:51,980 --> 01:33:58,540
I would encourage you to continue listening to my conversation with my guest on DailyWirePlus.com.
