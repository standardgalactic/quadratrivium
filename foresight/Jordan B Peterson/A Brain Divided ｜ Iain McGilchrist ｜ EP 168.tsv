0	7040	Hello. If you have found the ideas I discuss interesting and useful, perhaps you might
7040	14480	consider purchasing my recently released book, Beyond Order. 12 more rules for life, available
14480	20960	from Penguin Random House, in print, or audio format. You could use the links we provide
20960	28720	below or buy through Amazon or at your local bookstore. This new book, Beyond Order, provides
28720	34400	what I hope is a productive and interesting walk through ideas that are both philosophically and
34400	41440	sometimes spiritually meaningful, as well as being immediately implementable and practical.
42960	48080	Beyond Order can be read and understood on its own, but also builds on the concepts that I
48080	54720	developed in my previous books, 12 rules for life, and before that, maps of meaning.
55440	69440	Thanks for listening and enjoy the podcast.
69440	89040	I'm pleased today to be talking to Dr. Ian McGillchrist. I met him in 2018 in London, and
89040	95840	we had the good fortune to have a relatively brief conversation, which was taped and put on
95840	101840	YouTube, and it was very productive. And so now I get to talk to him again, and hopefully for a
101840	109120	longer period of time. Ian is a psychiatrist. Dr. McGillchrist is a psychologist, a psychiatrist,
109120	114480	a former fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, an associate fellow of Green Templeton College,
114480	119200	Oxford. He's lectured all over the world. He's published a number of scientific papers.
119200	125040	He's most well known for his book, The Master and His Emissary, and I think you have a copy of that.
125040	130720	I asked you to get that so that you could show people. The Master and His Emissary,
131600	136640	the divided brain in the making of the Western world, which is an analysis of hemispheric
136640	144880	specialization and its philosophical and scientific significance. And he's working on a new book,
144880	150000	which I have and have started to read a long ways into it at the moment, called The Matter of Things,
150720	155440	which will be forthcoming at some point in the future, and we'll shape some of our discussion
155440	163440	today. He's published broadly, scientifically and publicly, a study of paintings on
163440	168800	of subjects with psychotic illnesses that's coming out, I believe. I'm planning that.
170080	174080	And a series and also forthcoming a series of essays about culture and the brain.
174880	178320	So welcome. Thank you very much for agreeing to talk to me.
179520	181920	That was a huge pleasure, Jordan. Thank you very much.
183040	190800	So one of the things I was rereading the introduction to your new book this morning,
190800	197600	and I was struck by many different topics, but I was particularly interested in your
197600	207040	conception of attention. And so you talk about attention as something that in some sense brings
207040	213920	things into being. I don't think that's a misreading of your writing. And maybe I could
213920	218080	get you to expound on that a bit and to tell me what you think attention is, because I've had a
218080	223280	hell of a time differentiating it from, well, from fluid intelligence, for example, or from
223280	228640	consciousness. It's a word that makes sense when you hear it in the context of a bunch of other
228640	234000	words, but when you extract it out from that context and try to grip it, it falls apart in
234000	242880	your grasp. So I think one could say that attention is the way in which the individual disposes
243600	251600	his or her attention. It's a disposition of one's consciousness. So attention is how you
251600	257680	dispose your consciousness towards the world. And when I discovered, when I was researching
258560	261680	the master and his emissary, the book that's now 10 years old,
263680	270560	I came across this fascinating thing that one of the most fundamental differences
270560	276720	between the hemispheres is their way of attending. And it didn't entirely hit me at the time how
276720	282640	important it is. But we can talk about that later. But you were asking the rather sort of
282640	287920	interesting philosophical question about how attention helps to bring things into being.
288720	296320	And I think it does both generally and rather in a very particular sense in the left hemisphere.
297520	302640	Generally, what I mean is that how you attend to the world depends,
302720	308880	you know, on that depends what world you find. The qualities of the world that comes to your
308880	315600	attention is determined by the quality of the attention you bring to it. And
316720	323600	that's a very significant statement. I was talking to someone the other day who's somewhat
323600	330800	theologically minded. And he was also very interested in the role that attention played on
331120	337520	in constituting the world. I mean, you pay attention to things that you value one way or
337520	344080	another. And what that means is that the world tends to manifest itself in relationship to
344080	351760	your value structure. And that that's a very troublesome idea, in some sense, with regards
351760	358000	to our conceptions of the objective world, because it's not easy to it's not easy to parse out what's
358080	364400	objective, when what manifests itself to you is dependent in large part on what you value.
364400	366960	It's very complicated to sort that all out.
368240	375600	Well, possibly very much later, we can come to the question of what objective and subjective
375600	384240	mean and how one can, I think it's a mistaken dichotomy. I think one can interpret the words
384320	389360	interpret the words in important ways that give them meaning. But I think to think of the just
389360	395520	being an objective world out there and a subjective world in here is one of the problems with
395520	401520	modern Western philosophy. But to come back to the creation of the world, I was going to say that
401520	406640	not only does it sort of bring into the world the world that you know, which is after all by
406640	412640	definition the only world you will ever know. But it also changes who you are. So the quality of
412640	422000	the attention you pay changes you, the attender. So it's a very profound difference. And in the
422000	429920	first book, the master and his emissary, one of the things I was expounding was how this business
429920	440160	of attention creates a whole distinct world. So the hemispheres have evolved to two different
440160	445120	sets of values. You mentioned values, and it's very germane. They have different
446960	450800	reasons for existing and therefore have different things they respond to.
452960	463280	And what I have tried to explain in that book is that this gives rise to a whole way
463920	467680	of seeing the world in a whole world, which is not just for the individual, but also
468640	473840	at times it becomes the way of looking at the world for a whole culture. Because of course,
473840	479120	as individuals, never entirely distinct from our culture. We're partly created by our culture and
479120	486720	make it what it is. So it's a very fundamental thing. Well, you take pains in the master and his
486720	495280	emissary to promote the idea or to call attention to the idea that something extremely mysterious
495280	502320	is going on in relationship to hemispheric specialization. So it's a very ancient phenomenon.
504000	509600	Many creatures or most creatures with developed nervous systems have a bifurcated brain.
510400	516960	And the hemispheres differ substantially in terms of their neuroanatomical structure.
516960	523760	And the question arises, why is it necessary, assuming that that differentiation of structure
523760	528960	reflects some profound differentiation of function, why is it necessary to look at the world,
528960	536240	so to speak, in two ways? And why is it so necessary that that bifurcation is conserved
536240	542640	across evolutionary history? You'd think that one way would be sufficient, but it doesn't seem to be.
542640	546480	And so the first question is, why do you have to look at the world in two ways?
547040	552960	And the next question might be, well, what are those two ways? One of the things you outlined
552960	558800	that's particularly fascinating to me is that the right hemisphere seems to be specialized
558800	564880	more for what you don't know, whereas the left hemisphere is specialized more for what you do
564880	573920	know. And I've sort of defined knowing pragmatically, you know something if you undertake an action and
573920	578720	the outcome is what you specified. And you don't know something if you undertake an action and
578720	584720	the outcome is other than what you specified. And that sort of reflects that novelty visualization
586720	592960	division that was Goldberg, I believe, that originated that, that the neuropsychologist.
595120	599760	Well, Jordan, you've raised a whole bunch of points there. So I need a little bit of time to
600160	608800	to explain that. First of all, every neural network that we know of is asymmetrical,
609600	614160	going down to the very most basic network that we know, and the most ancient one that we know.
615200	622400	Nemetostellavictensis, a CNM and E that is 700 million years old is already asymmetrical in its
622400	626800	neural network. And that's the earliest neural network we know of. And it's true of insects,
626800	632560	it's true of worms, it's true of, you know, all the way up to human beings. And the three questions
632560	641120	that really got me going on this was if the brain is there for making connections and its power is
641120	647040	largely lies in the question, the connections it can make, why is it divided down the middle,
648240	653280	whoppingly divided? I mean, most people don't realize quite how big this this differentiation
653280	659360	is and if they haven't actually seen a brain. The second thing is why is it asymmetrical?
659360	663520	Because if you just need to grow this brain, you'd grow it symmetrically, the skull that
663520	669040	contains it is symmetrical. And the third thing is why is the connection, the principal connection
669040	674640	between the two hemispheres at the base of the hemispheres, the corpus callosum, why is it at
674640	682000	least as much if not more in the service of inhibition than facilitation? So it's as though
682000	689360	there's something really important about keeping two things apart. Now, my hypothesis,
690080	696400	and it's just that, is that this results from something that all creatures need to do.
697600	704880	All creatures without exception need to eat and not be eaten. They need to live and to manipulate
704880	709040	their environment, to get food, to catch something, to pick something up quickly,
709040	714160	deftly, to pick up a twig, to build a nest. In other words, for all the kind of day to day stuff,
714160	720640	food, shelter, they need to be able to manipulate the world very precisely. But at the same time,
720640	727040	they must pay a precisely opposite kind of attention, which is sustained, vigilant, open
727040	734800	without presupposition to as to what it may find. And so on the whole, the way in which this has
734800	742240	been addressed by evolution is that there are two neuronal masses that can direct attention at the
742240	749040	world. And the left hemisphere tends to specialize in targeted precise attention, and the right hemisphere
749040	753680	in a much broader, vigilant kind of attention, which actually sustains the being of the world.
754240	759040	Nothing about these tiny fragments that are isolated, disconnected, meaningless
760000	765440	gives you any idea of their meaning. It's only when you see the broad picture, and you understand
765440	769360	that they're not actually things that go to be put together to make that broad picture,
769360	775760	but are things that are isolated out of an already connected picture. So that's the
775760	781280	basis of that. I just wanted to pick up your thing about, because I don't think it's quite right to
781280	786000	say that the left hemisphere is about what you know, and the right's about what you don't know.
786000	795520	Somebody, I can't remember who, some philosopher said, that knowledge is what we're uncertain of.
796720	800320	The things we're certain of are things that we don't really know properly. I think there's a
800320	806560	good deal of truth in that. The left hemisphere tends to jump to conclusions. It's much more
806560	810800	quick and dirty than the right hemisphere. The right hemisphere is the one that says,
810800	815600	hang on, wait a moment, you may be getting this wrong, because it wants to get things quickly.
816080	821200	Its job is to manipulate. Its job is to get. It's to catch. It's to grab stuff. It's the
821200	827040	one that controls the right hand that does all the grabbing. So the left hemisphere tends to
827040	833040	price certainty, and it's very uncomfortable when there's ambivalence. Whereas the right
833040	834240	hemisphere- Well, what is that ambivalence you can't act?
835920	841760	Exactly. Whereas the right hemisphere seems to appreciate the possibility that we have to hold
841840	849920	multiple views, multiple possibilities together. And so it has a quite different
850800	858480	take on reality. It's more interested in discovery and exploration rather than capture.
858480	861760	The left hemisphere is more interested in capturing a thing that it thinks it knows, often,
862400	868080	you know, not in any deep way. It's just identified an object it needs. But to understand things,
868080	871920	the right hemisphere is better. And the idea of the master and the emissary is,
871920	878640	I won't go through the myth of it. I've explained it so many times, but the basic idea is that the
878640	883280	master, the right hemisphere, knows that it needs an emissary to do the sort of functional
883280	889200	administration work. So it's aware that the stuff that it mustn't get involved with and that it
889200	896000	can't know. Whereas the left hemisphere knows everything as it were in its eyes, because
896000	901760	it only knows a tiny bit, which is explicit. And, you know, there it is in broad daylight,
901760	908880	down in black and white, no shades of meaning, no nuances, nothing implicit about it.
908880	914480	So it thinks it knows it. And if you like the downfall of the left hemisphere, and therefore,
915200	922640	I would go with the society, the civilization, as it once was that we belong to, is that the
922640	928640	left hemisphere doesn't know what it is it doesn't know. It's, you know, it's, you know,
928640	933120	the famous thing they're done in Kruger effect. The more you know, the more you think you don't
933120	938160	know. And the people who know least think they know everything. It's a little, that's not quite
938160	943600	fair, but there's something of that about it. Yeah. But can I pick up something that I touched on
943600	949680	earlier? We're talking about creating the world through attention. And I think that is, that is
949680	956480	true. And there's a very big question there about what I mean by that. Do I mean just as you say
956480	963600	subjectively or objectively? And maybe we should part that for the moment. But I don't mean either
963600	969600	in a very simple way. But what is fascinating is that the right hemisphere, as I say, knows that
969600	975840	there are things that it's not aware of. But the left hemisphere seems to take the attitude
975840	982800	that if it's not attending to it, it doesn't exist. This is very dramatic in clinical neurology.
982800	990720	So people who've had a right hemisphere stroke, they not only, as it were, don't now pay attention
990720	996880	to something, but they deny that that thing ever existed. There's a wonderful, you know,
998160	1004080	very rich accounts of patients. One of the ones that I really like is an experiment done by,
1004560	1010880	who was it, Biziak and Lutsati, I think, back in the late 1970s, where they got a couple of highly
1010880	1017120	educated people with right hemisphere strokes. And they were in Milan at the time. And they said,
1017120	1022080	you know, these people lived in Milan. And they said, imagine you're standing in the Piazza del Duomo
1022080	1030320	in front of the cathedral and looking at the square. Describe all the buildings in the square.
1030320	1035040	And they would describe only the ones on the right side that the left hemisphere only pays attention
1035040	1039680	to. Whereas you know, but I need to say for the viewers that the right hemisphere pays attention
1039680	1045680	to both halves of the world. So when you have a left hemisphere stroke, the world is relatively
1045680	1050880	preserved globally. But after a right hemisphere stroke, you're only relying on this left hemisphere
1050880	1055120	who's interested in the bit of space which it can manipulate, the bit on the right. So they named
1055680	1059920	the buildings down the right hand side of the view of the square they had then.
1060800	1064240	And then the experimenters had asked them to go to the other end of the square and look at the
1064240	1070400	cathedral facade and name the buildings. And this time they named all the ones down the other side
1070400	1076080	of the square, but didn't mention any of the ones they just mentioned. So there's something,
1077120	1081680	it's been commented by one philosopher that it's almost like there's an ontological landslide.
1081680	1087440	Things come in and out of existence for the left hemisphere. And when it was pointed out to these
1087440	1092560	people what they'd missed, they became angry, irritable and frustrated, which is a typical
1093600	1103120	left hemisphere emotional town, impatient to dismiss this. So I think that's intriguing. I mean,
1103120	1107920	it's just one image. I mean, the very dramatic one is to do with denying that you have parts of the
1107920	1115920	body. And as was pointed out by Pritz Langler, I think way back in the second decade of the 20th
1115920	1122000	century, they don't only deny after a right hemisphere stroke that they have the left
1122000	1126080	half of the body, which is not functioning because of the right hemisphere stroke,
1127360	1132400	they will become very irritable if questions are asked about it or they will just go blank.
1132400	1135760	I mean, they will be talking perfectly coherently and then they're asked about that and they will
1135760	1142480	go stum, or they will become very irritated. And if you force them to recognize that they have a
1142480	1145920	body on that side, although they're perfectly intelligent people, they know they must always
1145920	1150480	have had a left half of their body, they will deny it. And he says it's as though they never had a
1150480	1155040	left half of the body. It's not only that it's not there now, it never was for them and never will
1155040	1161680	be. Now that's what I mean when I say that there are different levels of creativity of the world
1161680	1167440	or the creation of the world through attention, I should say, in the two hemispheres.
1168080	1174000	Now you're in your new book, and to some degree in the master and his emissary, you're also making,
1175200	1180480	you're mixing your neurological analysis with philosophical speculation and you're trying to
1180480	1187920	solve a problem. So maybe you could tell us what the problem is and then we can discuss the solution.
1188080	1196400	Well, I suppose the problem is the one that I mentioned, that there is a puzzle about why
1198720	1204480	brains are set up in this rather odd way. But you're also pointing to a kind of philosophical
1204480	1212320	malaise, right? So there's a conceptual problem, but also an emotional or broad-scale philosophical
1212320	1218720	problem. And there is, there is indeed. And indeed, if I may say so, the book that I hope will come
1218720	1225040	out fairly soon called The Matter with Things, which is a pun on several levels, because I think
1225040	1231520	it's a critique not only of the way we think now, but of our obsession with thinking of the world
1231520	1237680	as composed of things and that only matter exists. But anyway, in that book, what I'm really trying
1237680	1242720	to do is marry science and philosophy again. They never should have been separated. Science
1243600	1248800	cannot properly be done by philosophy without philosophy. Many scientists and philosophers
1248800	1253280	have commented on this over the years, and the divorce has been disastrous for them both.
1253280	1258320	You get a mindless kind of science that jumps to very naive conclusions that everything is
1258320	1265600	mechanical. And you get a kind of philosophy that thinks it's above dirtying its hands with science.
1265600	1274480	Now, I think each of these parties can benefit from a rapprochement, which is long overdue.
1274480	1280880	And it's that that I try to do in this very big book to show how strands of neurology, philosophy,
1280880	1288960	and physics, and even of world mythologies come together to show the same very similar pictures,
1288960	1296400	the same Gestalten, the same differences between a world such as the world brought into being by
1296400	1300400	the left hemisphere and a world such as is brought into being by the right hemisphere.
1300400	1303760	And perhaps if we're going on any further, you did invite me earlier to say something about
1303760	1309360	what those differences are. Well, to try and sum it up very quickly, what I'd say is for the left
1309360	1319520	hemisphere, things are known, familiar, literally things that are unfamiliar are better dealt with
1319520	1323600	by the right hemisphere until the left hemisphere can go, oh, I see, it's one of those and put it
1323600	1330000	in the category box. They're more distinct. In fact, they're probably entirely fragmentary or
1330000	1335440	isolated in the left hemisphere, whereas there the right hemisphere sees that nothing is ever
1335440	1343120	ultimately unconnected from everything else. Things in the left hemisphere are frozen.
1343120	1348480	They don't move. They don't change. Things in the right hemisphere are constantly flowing and changing,
1349120	1354960	although flowing and changing and remaining the same are not necessarily
1355040	1365360	an opposition. As we know, Heraclitus, my favorite philosopher, said, by changing, it remains the
1365360	1369440	same, which is the image of a river which is never, ever still for a moment, but the river
1370160	1376240	outside my house that was there at breakfast time is probably there now. So in that sense,
1376240	1381760	it's remained. And we're all, I believe, like these rivers are all living beings are. In fact,
1381760	1387120	probably everything that exists is as Heraclitus pointed out. So what are the things? The left
1387120	1393680	hemisphere abstracts. It tends to abstract from the body. It tends to abstract from the context.
1394320	1400080	And something I learned very early on in life was the importance of context, how it utterly changes
1400640	1406320	anything that somebody says or any image. And this is particularly true, of course, of literature,
1406320	1411920	which I studied and taught for a certain while when I was a young man,
1412720	1417040	that once you start paraphrasing a poem and taking its sentiments out of the context,
1417040	1422960	they've utterly changed themselves and no longer what they were. And the left hemisphere is more
1422960	1428480	interested in categories, the right hemisphere in the unique case. So it sees that you're not just
1429040	1433360	a member of a certain group, you take certain boxes, you fall into that category,
1433440	1439120	but that you're massively complicatedly different. And I mean, this has a very real basis, you know,
1439120	1444800	when you look at neurological patients, people who have right hemisphere strokes or examples,
1445760	1452240	to I know of that both come from the same research group in Switzerland, but involve
1454320	1461520	a farmer who used to know all his cows by name. And after the right hemisphere right parietal stroke,
1461520	1465760	he couldn't really, well, he not only couldn't tell his cows one from another,
1465760	1470480	but he could hardly tell a cow from a horse. And another woman who very plaintively
1470480	1475040	commented after a right hemisphere stroke, she'd spent her whole life studying the birds of
1475040	1478880	Switzerland, she was an authority on them. And she said, all the birds look the same.
1478880	1486240	So that's what happens in the left hemisphere world. Quality is replaced by quantity,
1487200	1494720	uniqueness is replaced by the category. And then again, the left hemisphere
1497200	1504480	tends to see things as inanimate, where the right hemisphere will see them as animate.
1505280	1513600	Well, a category implies in some sense that the members of that category are indistinguishable,
1513600	1517200	right? Because otherwise you don't have a category, you just have particularity. And so
1517200	1523600	you could imagine that, I mean, to understand this completely, you have to understand to some
1523600	1532800	degree what categories are for, or what categories are for, at least in part, you put things that you
1532800	1540960	can act towards the same way in the same category. And so young children might think of cats and
1540960	1549040	dogs as dogs, all of them as dogs, because they're cuddly, pettable entities, not because they have
1549040	1553360	four legs or because they have fur, but because you interact with them the same way. Then you can
1553360	1559360	differentiate cats and dogs as you get a little older. But the first category, dog, which is pettable
1559360	1565760	things, is a perfectly reasonable category. And you can imagine that once a categorical structure
1565760	1572160	has been imposed, that it's easy just to see the category. I wrote an essay in my new book,
1572880	1579040	which is called Beyond Order, about the function of artists. And I believe that part of what artists
1579040	1583680	do, and I think this is maybe, you can tell me, but I think it might reflect the differences that
1583680	1591440	you're talking about. When I was a kid, I lived in a small town, and I can remember all the houses
1591440	1597680	on my block. I can remember them in detail. They're familiar to me as individual entities, but
1598560	1604880	now that I'm an adult, I've lived on this street for like 20 years, but the houses are indistinguishable
1604880	1610960	to me. I can't see them as different entities. And I think it's because I'm so familiar with the
1610960	1617360	category house, which is a practical category, that I can't see beyond the category. And it's
1617360	1622560	very efficient, because I know what houses do. They sit there. You don't have to pay attention to
1622560	1629760	them. And so it's really a useful perceptual shorthand just to see the category. But what
1629760	1634800	an artist will do is take you outside the category and make you see that the particular is, again,
1634800	1640640	that you're missing. And I guess that's partly the context, to remind you of what's beyond
1641520	1648720	what your memory forces you now to see. And is that akin to this distinction that you're
1648720	1654560	making between the left and the right? Well, it is a distinction. It's a related distinction,
1654560	1660240	but not exactly the same distinction. I mean, interestingly, it relates to the difference,
1660240	1664080	a very important difference. In fact, I think probably the single most important difference
1664080	1670320	of all, which doesn't first strike people, partly because they're so used to living in a world of
1670400	1676960	representations. That is the distinction between the presencing of something as it comes into being
1676960	1683360	for you and your mental representation of it, which is like a caricature, or a category thing,
1683360	1694480	or a verbal sign, so that the left hemisphere's addiction, if you like, to understanding things
1694480	1703200	via language is very important. Because after all, language makes everything the same. As
1703200	1709520	Nietzsche said, it makes the uncommon common. Because when you say somebody's got brown hair
1709520	1714320	or something, then you've got everything just like in a category. But when you see that person,
1714320	1719200	there's something quite different about the way their hair is and so forth. And you'd find that
1719200	1724960	out if you painted it. Because you wouldn't paint it with brown paint. You'd paint it with a multitude
1724960	1729760	of colors if you were really looking at it. And you'd see that it wasn't brown. And I mean,
1729760	1735360	artists play with, was it Manet who painted the haystacks or Monet, I don't remember,
1736400	1741760	at multiple different times of the year? And the haystack, I mean, the shape was the same,
1741760	1746320	but the haystack was completely different. And that's really, in some sense, what he was portraying
1746320	1755760	was the category is haystack, but the reality is extraordinarily complex. But the category
1755760	1762560	seems to have functional significance. So you dump things together that you can act towards the same
1762560	1771040	way. And then a word is labeled on top of that to serve as an even further compressed shorthand
1771040	1779360	for that category. So you have a complex world, it's multitudinous, and too complex to even see.
1779360	1786640	And then there's a perceptual act that categorizes that into like a perceptual image house, say,
1786640	1792640	and then there's a further compression and eradication of information that enables that
1792640	1799280	to be represented by a word. Well, the Greek philologist Max Muller said,
1799280	1805760	it's interesting that we read encyclopedias, we have dictionaries, we read books, and we are
1805760	1814080	with all these words, but none of the things that these words represent actually exist,
1814080	1818800	because in the act of being represented, they are no longer the thing that was present,
1818800	1822480	the very fact of representing it suddenly stops the presence of the thing. For me,
1822480	1826480	this is very vivid in Wordsworth. And this comes back to some of the things you were saying about
1826480	1834880	the liveliness of the childhood mind, that when he was a young man, and 50 years a boy,
1834880	1841120	rambling in the Lake District, the world was very much still alive to him and coming into
1841120	1847760	being for him, but that as a man, he went back there and as it were, couldn't avoid seeing
1847760	1854240	the landscape as, oh, a picturesque mountain, a picturesque lake, one of those if you like.
1854240	1858400	And this is what he means by the phrase, the shades of the prison house,
1858400	1868400	closing round the growing boy in his intimations of immortality on reflection in early childhood.
1868400	1877760	So this is from this book. There was a time when Meadow groven streamed the earth and every
1877760	1883440	common sight, to me did seem appareled in celestial light, the glory and the freshness
1884160	1889200	of a dream. Yes. That's it. This is what I'm referring to. And this really is one of the
1889200	1895840	more important differences. I would say probably the core difference, that as it were, one world
1895840	1904800	is real, vibrant, unknown in part, only known ever to a degree, and ever more coming into being,
1904800	1909440	and ever more coming into knowledge for the right hemisphere. And for the left hemisphere,
1909440	1914800	already cold, finished, known, dead, put in a book, stuffed on the shelf, filed away.
1915600	1922160	And we now live so much in this virtual, represented world, partly because they're
1922160	1928480	very much cut off from nature, which constantly reminds you of its vivid, uncertain liveliness.
1928480	1935040	It confronts you with its audacious beauty and vitality all the time, partly because we've
1935040	1940880	learnt to cut our minds off from our bodies. And so we think in this enormously abstract way,
1940880	1947120	and partly because of city life, partly because of technology, which means we interact with two
1947120	1952240	dimensional screens, rather than the three dimensional depth, which is in a room when
1952240	1958160	you're with someone, which is why, as you know, and I know, because we've both helped patients
1958160	1963680	in our time, that it's very important to be in the room with the patient. It's a completely
1963760	1968720	different thing that happens from anything you can do on the telephone, or even like this.
1971200	1976960	So part of the philosophical case that you're making is, I believe that,
1978240	1985840	while we have a terrible conundrum as human beings, we need, in some sense, for the purposes of
1985840	1992080	efficiency to move towards the most efficient representations possible. And this has real
1992640	1996880	bearing on the nature of perception itself. So I know, for example, that even in the primary
1996880	2003520	visual cortex, so in principle, you know this, but I'm going to explain it for people who are listening,
2005120	2010080	as the signals, as the pattern signals from your retina move back towards your brain,
2010080	2017840	they move upwards, so to speak, through a hierarchy of processing units. And even at the first stages
2017840	2024400	of that processing, there's still more top down input from other brain centers than there is input
2024400	2029280	from the retinal structures themselves. And so what that implies is that even at the beginnings
2029280	2034880	of perception, you know, if you think about it as being built up from perceptual elements up
2034880	2039680	towards the whole gestalt, which isn't exactly accurate, but it'll do for now, even at the
2039680	2044400	beginnings of the visual process, there's more input from what's inside than there is from the
2044400	2049680	external world, so to speak, or at least as much. And then what seems to happen as we age is that,
2049680	2057520	perhaps, is that increasingly, that perception becomes solipsistic. And so we're only seeing
2057520	2062080	what we know. And that's extraordinarily efficient, because it's very hard to build up a new perception.
2062720	2067360	You have to really investigate something in detail to see it anew. Whereas if it's the
2067360	2072320	same old thing that you've seen 10,000 times, you can already use what you know. And it's not
2072320	2076480	surprising you'd be annoyed if you were forced to jump out of that, because there's a tremendous
2076480	2080720	amount of work that has to be done if you want to see something for the first time again.
2082400	2090160	Well, as we both know, people would rather deny obvious truths than let go of a cherished belief.
2090160	2099600	So that's certainly right. And we don't perceive the world as, you know, in a naive way. We come
2099680	2106880	to the world with our history, with our vast range of experience. And so, as you say, this top-down
2108400	2114560	effects on the lower end of things, of the lower end of perception, from higher cognitive functions.
2115520	2120320	But that's an image of something very important to the philosophy I try to put across in the
2120320	2127120	matter with things, which is that in order to understand any element in experience,
2128080	2137360	it's at least as important to see what holes it goes to make up, or potentially can go to make up,
2137360	2142960	as it is to see what it turns into when you break it down. In fact, often it's not very revealing
2142960	2146080	to find out what happens when you break it down. And so, in a way-
2146080	2152960	Psychology suffers from that. Psychology is a discipline that consists, at least in its present
2153040	2159520	form, mostly of disparate experiments, which demonstrate very particular things about how
2159520	2166560	people behave in very particular circumstances. But there's very little that unites that back up
2166560	2174000	to something that isn't merely fragmentary observation. And so, it's very difficult to get
2174000	2181040	a grip on. And there's billions of potential separate observations. And they're not that
2181040	2186880	helpful in some sense. Well, it's all part of the world picture, which from the philosophical
2186880	2193760	point of view is the purpose of the long book, which I sent to you in manuscript, The Matter
2193760	2202240	with Things. And effectively, I can state quite simply that I want to give a considered
2202800	2211360	response to the philosophy of our age, which is that there is only matter, and that things
2211360	2218160	are understood by reducing them to their parts, unless it doesn't change them. It's a very naive
2218160	2225360	philosophy. It's simplistic, and it's immoral, because it changes the way we treat the world
2225360	2232320	and other people and nature. It changes our idea of who we are in a very damaging way,
2232320	2238160	ruling out things that other traditions have traditionally held as very powerful.
2238720	2244000	And coming back to your comment about how people cling on to things that they believe,
2244000	2248960	and it's much more difficult to try and see something in a different way, especially with age.
2249600	2253680	This is why, of course, most traditions of spiritual growth
2256480	2262800	enjoin on the person paradoxes, to see things in a completely new way that violates all the
2262800	2269920	ways that they thought they knew. So I use paradox in this new book, but not in some blind way.
2269920	2276800	In fact, I show that what we mean by a paradox is that the view of the left hemisphere of something
2276800	2281680	and the view taken of the right hemisphere of the same thing can never actually completely
2281680	2289440	marry up. They have different qualities, and if you push the comparison or the desire to make
2289440	2295120	them logically come together too far, you end up with a paradox. And this started happening
2296480	2304080	early on in the ancient Greek period of philosophy with Xeno. This is where the first
2304080	2310880	paradoxes come from, and I have a whole chapter on paradox, which I see as generated by the desire
2310880	2316160	of the left hemisphere to say it must be this or it must be that, clinging on preferentially to the
2316160	2322000	very fragmentary view of the left hemisphere. See, the left hemisphere is not good at understanding.
2322000	2328000	That sounds a very blanket statement, and it is. But the whole of the first part of that book,
2328080	2337280	the new book, is massively more thorough neuropsychology than is in the master and his emissary.
2337280	2343360	So it's about as thorough as I could possibly make it. And what I do is I look at the ways
2343360	2349120	in which we have any chance of getting an idea of what the world is. What are the portals of entry
2349760	2356800	of, if you like, information about the world to us? And I take it that it depends very much on
2356800	2362640	our attention, how we dispose our attention, perception, the judgments we form on the basis
2362640	2372640	of perception, the ways in which we apprehend what we're dealing with, rather than comprehend it,
2372640	2379040	in other words, grasp it, as we say, with the right hand of the left hemisphere, take it, use it.
2379840	2387440	And how we understand it in terms of emotional intelligence, which is not a small thing,
2387440	2392000	it's the whole way in which we understand everything human by emotional, I don't mean
2392000	2398000	sort of in some, you know what I mean, I'm talking about social and emotional understanding,
2398000	2403440	the sort of thing that is absent in people with autism. And cognitive intelligence,
2403440	2409360	this may surprise people, but that all these things and creativity, so creativity,
2410080	2417040	intelligence of the cognitive kind, IQ kind, emotional and social intelligence, apprehension
2417920	2424080	is a separate case, I'll come to that in a second, perception and attention and judgment,
2424080	2429680	all these are better performed by the right hemisphere, only apprehension is better performed
2429680	2434800	by the left hemisphere. So the only thing the left hemisphere is better at is getting a hold on
2434800	2443680	either an idea, very precise, clear one, or on a thing that it wants to use, but all the manifold
2443680	2448400	complexity, which our intelligence brings to bear in order to understand the world, all of that is
2448400	2454400	better done by the right hemisphere. And I can say that on the basis not just of experiments in
2454400	2459520	normal subjects, but on seeing what happens when you have either left hemisphere damage or right
2459520	2465680	hemisphere damage, to summarize a vast chunk of information, which I hope will be there for
2465680	2473120	people to read very, very soon. To summarize that very briefly, what one would say is that when you
2473120	2478720	have damage to the right hemisphere, your grasp of reality is the main thing that's impaired,
2478720	2483680	you don't understand it, you don't connect with it, your ability to understand what's going on,
2484240	2488960	disappears. Whereas when you have a right hemisphere, sorry, when you have a,
2488960	2492480	that's when you have a right hemisphere, when you have a left hemisphere stroke,
2492480	2496160	the main things are you have difficulty speaking and using your right hand, they're
2496160	2502080	practically very important, but essentially the understanding of the world, the grasp of the
2502080	2507520	meaning of the world, so we have to use these words grasp again, but the overall comprehension
2507520	2513120	of the world is sustained by the right hemisphere. Okay, so let me ask you a question. Can I,
2513120	2519840	sure, go ahead. All right, okay. All right, okay, let me just make this point. Because I want to,
2519840	2525120	people might say, well, okay, but so what? We've both got right and left hemispheres,
2525680	2530560	so we're not missing anything, so does it matter? Well, yes, it matters very importantly for my
2530560	2537040	philosophical project, because as I show in the second part of the book, where I look at the proper
2538000	2543680	contributions to understanding made by reason, science, intuition and imagination,
2546880	2554880	what I can show is that in those attempts to grasp, we can see the world, we can see the
2554880	2559840	signature of the right hemisphere or the signature of the left hemisphere on a particular model.
2559840	2566720	So if we have two possible models of a certain action or an aspect of reality or space or time,
2566800	2571680	which I deal with in the third part of the book, and indeed in philosophical history and in the
2571680	2578080	history of physics and so on, there have tended to be opposing views of the world. Once you know
2578080	2583040	how the left hemisphere sees it and how the right hemisphere tends to see things, you can see the
2583040	2589120	hallmark of the left hemisphere's understanding on a certain philosophical standpoint, on a certain
2589120	2597520	scientific take of the world, and you can see the hallmark and the imprint of the right hemisphere
2597520	2603760	in certain other ways of reasoning and of science and philosophy. So this is very important,
2603760	2609120	because up till now, we've never been able to judge between these two. We've got A, we've got B,
2609120	2613760	we just have to go, hmm, can't tell, we can't reconcile them, we can't do without either of them.
2614560	2622080	That's true, ultimately that's true, but we can get a very sharp idea, I believe now,
2623120	2627760	of which of these is fallacious, which one is going to lead us down a blind alley, which one
2627760	2632640	is out of touch with reality and which one is more in touch with reality. I just wanted to say that,
2632640	2638160	because it's behind the whole philosophical drift of my book, which is how do we know who we are?
2638160	2644400	I asked Plotinus his question, who are we? That's effectively the question, what is the cosmos,
2644400	2652080	what is nature, and how do we all relate? Sorry, I hand over to you. No, no, that's good. Okay, so
2653920	2660720	to do something, you have to zero in on it. So let me lay something out for you, and then I'm
2660720	2665600	going to ask you a specific question about it. So imagine that I'm concentrating on the computer
2665600	2669760	screen, I'm attending to it, I'm writing a book. Okay, so the question might be, well, what am I
2669760	2677360	doing while I'm writing that book? What is it to write that book? Well, at the most focused level
2677360	2685520	of my consciousness, the most focal level, that involves voluntary control of my fingers. I'm going
2685520	2690080	to be typing single letters, and there are muscle movements that are associated with that, but I
2690080	2694640	don't really know what the muscle movements are, I know how to move my fingers, that's the highest
2694720	2700000	level of resolution I can manage. I can press T with my left hand and H with my right hand,
2701760	2707760	with these two fingers. And so that's sort of where the pedal hits the metal, in some sense,
2707760	2714320	that's where my intent meets the world. Okay, so, but I'm not typing letters, sorry, I am typing
2714320	2719440	letters, but at the same time I'm typing words. And at the same time I'm typing words, I'm typing
2719440	2726080	phrases. And then I'm typing sentences, and I'm typing paragraphs, and I'm typing chapters,
2726080	2731600	and then I'm typing books. And then the book itself is an artifact that's nested inside
2732560	2738160	higher order structures. So, well, I'm writing the book, but the reason I can write the book is
2738160	2746720	because I'm imagining a world within which the book is nested. And so I'm focusing on something
2746720	2752080	very specific, like I can't write the book without pushing the letter T with my left index finger,
2752720	2757760	but I also can't write the book without apprehending the book as a whole. And, you know, when I edit,
2758320	2764000	I edit not letters because I can spell, but I edit words, I substitute one word for another,
2764000	2769120	I edit phrases, I edit sentences, I edit at the paragraph level, like all of these levels actually
2769120	2776880	exist. Now, is it reasonable to suppose? So, sorry, I'm going to add one more level outside
2776880	2781600	that. So you might ask, well, why am I writing a book? And it might be, well, because I'm a
2781600	2790160	practicing scientist, and why is that important? Well, I'm a dutiful citizen, let's say, trying
2790160	2794080	to uphold my moral responsibility. And you might say, well, why is that important? And I would say,
2794080	2801280	well, that's part of my proper moral engagement with the world. And then I can't go further
2801280	2807360	outside than that. Now, is it reasonable to suppose, if you think about that whole structure as a kind
2807360	2813520	of lens that focuses us in the world, is it reasonable to suppose that it's the left hemisphere,
2813520	2819200	so to speak, that's concentrating on the T's and the H's, and that as you move up that hierarchy
2819200	2825440	to broader and broader levels of conceptualization, that the manner in which those higher levels
2825440	2828960	are conceptualized shifts more and more to the right, or is processed more and more by the
2828960	2834240	right, is that a reasonable way of looking at it? I think you could, but I'd need to sort of gloss
2834240	2842160	it a bit. And what you've beautifully described is what the right hemisphere knows, and which
2842160	2847840	John Muir summarized by saying, if you try to get hold of any one thing and pull it, you find that
2848160	2852560	bring with it the whole of the rest of the universe, yet that sentence you're writing
2854240	2859680	is informed by your personal history and the history, therefore, of your culture,
2859680	2865680	and therefore, and so on and so on and so forth. So everything that has gone to make you is present
2865680	2872720	in that business of the book. And so you're not, of course, at any one time aware of more than a
2872720	2880960	tiny bit. But there's a very fallacious and superficial argument that if you're not conscious of
2880960	2886960	it, in that sense of the word conscious, then somehow you're not doing it. But of course you are,
2886960	2893760	the whole thing emanates from what I call the field of view. Now, suppose rather than, you know,
2893760	2898480	we can take the example of the typing, but you wouldn't be able to type at all if you were
2898480	2905360	thinking about what your fingers were doing. And, you know, but nonetheless, it would be stupid to
2905360	2908880	say that you're unconscious while you're typing. Of course, you're not unconscious.
2909920	2915280	Somebody playing a Bach fugue has got to use all their fingers and their hands, you know,
2915280	2920640	and their feet at the same time. And if they concentrated, they could only concentrate and
2920640	2925680	focus on one finger. Of course, that would stop the whole music for a start. But they're, they're
2925680	2929920	conscious, of course, they're just as conscious when the whole thing's happening as they are if
2929920	2936080	they think about the finger and stop it. So what this illustrates is what Alfred North Whitehead
2937040	2944640	was keen to point out that as soon as we master something, we relegate it to another part of
2944640	2951040	the mind that we don't any longer have to focus on. And the focusing of tension is costly. He said,
2951040	2960000	it's like cavalry charges in battle. It should only be done rarely. You need fresh horses and it
2960000	2966000	comes at a high cost. So that's a good analogy. Because you build a you build a little machine,
2966000	2972240	the things, the things, the things that the things that we do unconsciously are in no way
2972240	2978160	inferior stuff. So for example, the Bach fugue is not inferior. When a surgeon is learning,
2978960	2984240	he or she has to be very conscious of what he or she's doing, the actual business of the hand
2984240	2991840	cutting. But when the surgeon is very skilled, he can hum, listen to the radio chat with colleagues,
2991840	2996960	and it's all happening. Similarly, a chess player, a bad chess player has to be conscious of every
2996960	3002560	move, but a really good one is not unconscious. It's very, very highly conscious, but it's not
3002640	3010400	focused. Now, my distinction to sorry, finally answer your question is that is that focused
3010400	3016720	attention, this focal attention on the detail is what the left hemisphere does. It can only
3016720	3023280	take in about three degrees for the attentional art. So it's incredibly limited. And as as Whitehead
3023280	3030800	says, it has its uses in an emergency. But really, it's not a satisfactory way for living. And what
3030800	3035920	I think is happening is that we are now more and more saying anything that I'm not actually focusing
3035920	3042320	on right now doesn't exist. All the implicit stuff, all the unconscious stuff, all the things that go
3042320	3049040	to make up the richness of our both cognitive and emotional and embodied cells, isn't really
3049040	3055200	important. We focus down on this tiny bit that the relatively unintelligent left hemisphere
3055760	3061760	knows about and is aware of. So when I say conscious and unconscious, I like to say,
3061760	3068880	don't think of these as two separate realms, like, you know, two tanks with perhaps a trap and things
3068880	3073920	can pop up from the lower tank into the higher tank or whatever. But instead, think of it like
3073920	3079200	a stage, and there's a spotlight. And the spotlight may just illuminate one part of the
3079200	3083200	stage, but the rest of the stage hasn't gone anywhere. It's still there. And you just need
3083200	3087280	to move the spotlight. And suddenly it's there again in the middle of what you're thinking about.
3087280	3093680	That's how I would see that question. Okay, so let's go back to this typing example again. Just
3094480	3100800	so when you learn to type, you're going to be paying conscious attention to pushing the T's and
3100800	3108400	the H's. As you learn to type, you start perhaps being conscious more of maybe you're attending
3108400	3114000	at the level of the phrase. Like, you don't have to be consciously attentive to those things you've
3114000	3120560	built automated machinery for. Now they say when kids learn to read, it isn't enjoyable to begin with
3120560	3126720	because it's effortful to learn to process the letters, and it's effortful to learn to process
3126720	3132320	the words. And it's not until they can automatize the letter and word processing, and so they can
3132320	3138160	read the word at a glance, that they start to be able to be conscious of the phrase and the sentence,
3138160	3141920	and that's when they get the meaning from the text, and that's when it starts to become
3142480	3148000	enjoyable, right? It's not just effortful. And then, so the consciousness of a reader isn't
3148000	3152160	consciousness of letters, and it's not consciousness of words. It's consciousness of something like
3152160	3157760	the interplay between sentences and paragraphs. And it's like your consciousness floats above
3158320	3164480	the highest level of automatization that you've been able to manage. Does that seem reasonable to
3164480	3170320	you? Well, I mean, when you're playing a musical piece, for example, you don't pay attention to
3170320	3175440	what you've practiced because you've got that. You pay attention to the sequencing of what you've
3175440	3181280	practiced. And the greater a musician you are, the higher up in the abstraction hierarchy,
3181280	3187680	you can focus because you've automated all the lower stuff. Well, yes, and that comes back to
3187680	3193200	what, I'm sorry. No, I was, I was, I'm trying to get the relationship between that and the
3193200	3200000	hemisphere specialization. Well, I think I've done my best to point out that the right hemisphere
3200560	3206560	is the one that is able to attend to the whole Gestalt ultimately is dealing not in
3207200	3212480	fragmentary entities that have to be put together, but in Gestalt and that already exist and are
3212480	3218800	nested so that you go down from one level and you find another, you know, famously you can go from
3218880	3224640	the, from the body to the organ to the tissue to the cell to the organelle to the, you know,
3224640	3232400	and each of these at each stage is a whole that has its own qualities and its own rules
3232400	3240240	really and works in a semi-autonomous way. So there's always freedom between the levels of
3240240	3245840	understanding. There's always space. It's rather like the gaps in the structure are where the light
3245840	3250560	gets in. You know, if you tighten everything up, then you've got total darkness. So what we're
3250560	3256240	trying to do all the time is to know enough to be able to act, but to leave it open so that we
3256240	3261680	can know more and really understand where we are and what we're doing when we're acting. So I think
3261680	3266720	these are significant differences between the left hemisphere which is utterly goal directed
3268000	3275120	and very direct in the way in which it achieves or aims to achieve its goal and the right hemisphere
3275120	3283120	which is sustaining this and also seeing the goal in a wider whole. You know, the reason of typing
3283120	3287200	these letters is not just to make the keys go up and down and to have a bit of paper at the end of
3287200	3293680	it, but because you want to influence minds that are now unaware of this but will know about it
3293680	3298800	soon. So I think it's the difference between this very, again, Whitehead says there's a
3298800	3306560	civilization advances by the number of actions that can be made automatic or below the level.
3306560	3314080	Sorry? Without thinking. Without thinking. Because thinking is very complex thing,
3314080	3318960	isn't it? I mean, what is it? And a number of people have commented rather along the lines
3318960	3325920	that I'm saying that it's not so much right to say I think as in Kogito, but in the words of
3325920	3334240	Lichtenberg, the 18th century German philosopher and physicist, esdenkt, esdenkt in mir, something
3334240	3341760	is thinking in me. And that is the me. It's not separate and it's not unconscious in the sense of
3343520	3347920	it has no life, it has no meaning, it has no purpose, it has no direction. Absolutely not,
3347920	3353680	it has all those things. And one of the things I'm trying to argue in the last part of,
3354560	3358320	may I say something just about the structure of this book? I started off on it, this new book
3358320	3362400	and I'm just going to say a little bit more about it. Yeah, yeah. So I've explained the first part.
3362400	3366800	Yeah, well we're trying to grasp something large going through its parts and it's not such a simple
3366800	3372800	thing to do. It's not a simple thing to do. So the first part of the book I've explained,
3373440	3380720	it gives one an insight into a simple fact that in terms of having access to the reality of the
3380720	3387680	world, the right hemisphere is better than the left. And it has a special take, if you like,
3387680	3392160	which we can recognize so that when we're having to choose between two opposites, we can choose one
3392880	3397280	if we want to over the other. And then the second part of the book, I'm looking at the
3397280	3403440	pathways to knowledge, using attention, perception, judgment, intelligence, how do we put them to use?
3403440	3409440	Well, I think the main ones are science, reason, I think most people would say they're important,
3409440	3416080	I would say intuition and imagination are also vastly important. Now none of these is infallible,
3416080	3420720	none of these can say that it can deal with everything. There are proper limits to science,
3420720	3428480	otherwise you're peddling untenable naive scientism. But it is a very important thing
3428480	3435840	for us to respect and to do honorably. Reason is enormously important. I use science and reason
3435840	3442160	as the basis of my book. But again, reason, as Pascal, famous mathematician and philosopher said,
3442160	3448960	reason is poor if it cannot see its own limitations. And so it has limitations,
3448960	3453760	but it can achieve a very great deal. And the same actually is true of intuition. It's had a
3453760	3460160	very bad press in recent years, because I think, again, psychologists, I think you've alluded to
3460160	3464960	this, they like things that can be taken down into bits and shown them, we can find the mechanism.
3464960	3472160	Intuition is a bit hard for that. And imagination has been, again, relegated to the sort of children's
3472160	3479760	playbox that this is something to do with fantasy. Whereas in fact, I argue that quite the opposite,
3479760	3484080	but whereas fantasy may be an interesting decoration on things that we already know,
3484640	3489840	and the left hemisphere can do that. Imagination is actually how we go to meet the world and
3489840	3495680	understand it. And we have to imagine it into being. There is no alternative. If we are not
3495680	3499920	imaginatively engaged with the world, we just can't see a lot of things that are there.
3500880	3508800	So we need to use all of these faculties together, not just one or two as we now do. Sorry, Carol.
3508800	3515200	Well, I wanted to comment on your discussion of imagination and the manner in which it brings
3515200	3523040	the world into being. So we've already discussed the fact that the realm of your experience is
3523040	3529280	dependent to some degree on your attention, and that that's associated with intent. And intent
3529280	3535920	seems to me to be it's future oriented to have an intent. Intent means to attempt to move from one
3535920	3541600	place to another. And hypothetically, it's a better place because why move otherwise. And so
3542320	3548880	to act in the world with intent means that you're playing out something that's imaginative because
3548880	3555360	to posit that one thing is better than another, and therefore want to move towards it, you have to
3555360	3560640	have imagined up a better world. And so what that means in some sense is that we're always meeting
3560640	3567360	the world in a way that imposes our imaginative attempts to make it better upon us, upon the
3567360	3576880	world. But that also brings the world into being. And so and I guess I'm saying that because I'm
3576880	3583680	trying to grapple with the why of your book again. You're implying throughout and more than implying
3583680	3591920	that we have a paucity of viewpoint that's demotivating and dangerous. And you're implying as
3591920	3597920	well that that has something to do with our obsessive concentration or utilization of left
3597920	3603360	hemisphere functions. And that that reminds me of Heidegger to some degree and his claim that
3603360	3608720	moderners use the world as produce, you know, that we tend to reduce everything to its functional
3608720	3614000	utility insofar as it can be exploited. And like I have some sympathy for that because we have to
3614480	3622640	the world to live. But yes, it it it. So let's say we do lose something by being specific.
3625120	3629600	And narrow, we gain something which is functional utility. What do we do about that?
3630400	3633920	You're trying to understand it and why it is what do we do to fight against it?
3636080	3641680	Well, that's a whole separate question. But at the moment, I'm trying to unpack
3641680	3648480	what the problem is. Okay, well, I won't push past that. Yeah, I mean, I mean,
3649200	3655600	quite what we do about it is the million dollar question. And we may not be in a position
3656400	3662240	unless we radically alter the way in which we think about the world, understand it and feel
3662240	3669120	it and experience it and interact with it. We may not have a world in which to live. So it's
3669200	3676960	a pretty important topic. But in so having sort of more or less, as it were, gone over what are
3676960	3681920	the portals to understanding, what are the paths to understanding, I then in the part three, which
3681920	3688240	is really, if you like, the reason we've had parts one and two, you can't get to part three without
3688240	3694880	them. But when you get there, we want to know, so what is the world like? And so I look at the
3694880	3700400	structure of the world, the theories about it and what we can tell from physics and from
3700400	3705440	the hemisphere hypothesis, what parts of it we may be perceiving with the left hemisphere and what
3705440	3711280	we may be seeing with the right. And I look at the structure in the sense of the coming together
3711280	3716000	of opposites and the very interesting philosophical question of the relationship between the one
3716000	3725600	and the many. And then in the rest of the book, I look at time, space, motion, meaning largely flow,
3725600	3738000	but all kinds of motion, matter and consciousness, value, purpose, and the sense of the sacred.
3738000	3745120	Now, I argue that these elements like consciousness are not secondary, they're not
3745120	3750960	derivative, it's actually irrational to suppose they are. Reason is on the side of the fact that
3750960	3758080	they are ontological primaries. And I argue that actually also unpack that for people because it's
3758080	3764880	there's a lot, but it would take a very long time. Well, I can unpack the phrase what I mean by
3764880	3772960	ontological primary is that it can't be reduced to other terms. It can't be said that as long as
3772960	3780000	you look at a brain in a certain way, you can work out what consciousness is. Consciousness is
3780000	3786880	sui generis. It is of its own kind. It is not something that is derived from anything. It has
3786880	3793680	to be a primary constituent of the universe. This is not a particularly any longer controversial view.
3794880	3802160	It's held by many philosophers now in the form of panpsychism in which something like consciousness
3802160	3808480	is in the cosmos and the cosmos perhaps exists inside consciousness, not my consciousness, but
3809280	3815840	a consciousness field. And there are plenty of neuroscientists who say this too.
3816800	3823360	Colin Blakemore, not known for being kind of away with the fairies, but they say this too.
3825520	3831760	But I would also argue, and it's a perhaps harder thing to make comprehensible in a very short
3831760	3837280	space, but that actually values are things that are there. They're not things we make up. They're
3837280	3847840	not things that are like, I rather like that. They are built into the drive of everything.
3848800	3853440	And I think that the cosmos has drives. You can describe them in all sorts of ways. It has
3854720	3859760	the fact that it changes and moves in certain ways according to, quote, laws, which may actually
3859760	3864480	not be laws, but maybe temporary habits. We don't know. They may be evolving too. But the very fact
3864560	3870480	that this thing has this energy to evolve, to differentiate, to produce differentiation
3870480	3876880	within union, this is a value of a kind. You can't get behind these. And most of our values,
3877520	3882000	other than those of utility, this is good for me and I want to have more of it, which is what
3882000	3890160	the left hemisphere is devoted to. Most of those other values are not reducible to share in the
3890160	3897120	material greed or feathering your own nest. They're often actually the things that are vastly
3897120	3902240	important. Probably the whole point of the being consciousness at all is to come to appreciate
3902240	3908320	the meaning of truth, goodness and beauty, to have a sense of something awe-inspiring, which is
3908320	3912960	really what we mean when we talk about the sacred, that we're humble enough to say we don't know
3912960	3917920	everything and we probably will never know. I mean, why should we? That's also a totally irrational
3917920	3922560	idea that our brains are so constructed that we should know everything. I mean, a mouse might
3922560	3925760	think that if it could think that much, you'd think it knows everything, but it doesn't.
3927040	3931120	So, and we're evolving. There may be creatures in the future who think, what the hell did
3931120	3938480	homo sapiens in 2021 know? So, I just want to get back into the frame that not all the things
3938480	3946720	that matter to us, they are enormously important aspects of a universe that is not dead and static,
3946720	3952560	unless given a push, not without purpose, not without meaning, not without value. These things
3952560	3958560	are in the grain, in the warp and the weft of the cosmos. Of that I'm certain. And the job is
3958560	3967360	for us to find this. And most philosophers, wise people, sages, whatever you like to call them,
3967360	3973520	in the past, have adopted a view of the cosmos, which is exactly the one that one would expect
3973520	3979520	the right hemisphere to hold, which is one in which things are not always certain or known,
3979520	3984000	they're changing, they're interconnected, but the whole thing has a meaning. It is
3984000	3991760	not a heap of fragments that don't mean anything. The modern malaise. So, that's really where I'm
3991760	3998400	driving at, if you see, that's the philosophical goal, is to help people see something that I
3998400	4004480	think they already intuit. I mean, that was a response to the master and his emissary.
4005200	4011280	Apart from people enormously movingly writing to me, saying things I never thought I would ever
4011280	4015840	hear from writing a book, like your book changed my life, and I'm sure you've had this too.
4016400	4023120	But, you know, people saying, what you're saying, I kind of knew, I've known this, but I couldn't
4023120	4028080	find any way of articulating it. Well, there's a reason why you couldn't find a way of articulating
4028080	4034640	it, and that is articulation in language is controlled by the left hemisphere. It developed
4034640	4038800	very good tools for mapping out the world in a way that is very useful to its purposes.
4039520	4045520	But the important things are hard to articulate in words. They're implicit meanings,
4045520	4052560	all the deep things like love, religion, poetry, music. How do you say these in words? How do you
4052560	4057920	say them in language? But they have extraordinary meaning and power. They're the things we live for,
4057920	4062000	not for the things that we can say put down in a notebook, if you know what I mean.
4063840	4070000	So what's driven you in this direction, do you think? I mean, you made a very large number of
4070000	4078880	claims in that last section of thought. For example, you've come to the belief that value
4079520	4084320	is somehow implicit in the structure of being. That's what I understood what you said, and correct
4084400	4090880	me if I'm wrong, and that it's unfolding across time. I mean, I've been thinking about this
4091840	4102640	exact issue an awful lot. It's very difficult to formulate this question. So imagine that we're
4102640	4109840	drawn towards an ideal. Human beings are drawn towards an ideal. Imagine that you can detect
4109840	4115760	that draw by your own dissatisfaction, in part, is that you don't feel you're living properly,
4115760	4119840	or your conscience is bothering you. You feel that there's something more to be attained.
4119840	4125200	You're embarrassed at your insufficiencies, right? So there's this ideal that's pulling you onward
4125200	4130560	and judging you at the same time. And that ideal might be, well, the ideal human being,
4130560	4135280	that's one way of thinking about it. And that's partly why I got so interested in hero mythology.
4135280	4144000	I mean, is it a reasonable conclusion of your line of thinking that the notion of the ideal
4144000	4151120	human being is somehow built into the structure of the cosmos? Because the class, I don't know how to...
4151120	4155440	No, it's not. No, I don't think that at all. I want to scotch that immediately.
4156160	4159680	Okay, well, how do you scotch that if you start with your presuppositions?
4160640	4166800	Well, because I don't... My presuppositions have nothing to do with an already conceived plan
4168320	4170800	that is just being acted out. This takes us back to the bad...
4170800	4173120	No, it wasn't applying. It wasn't necessarily...
4173120	4176640	Oh, all right. Well, okay. But let... All right. Okay. Well, I'm glad you weren't.
4176640	4181600	But a lot of people think that if I say these things, I must be positing an engineering god
4181600	4186000	who sort of tinkers with things and makes things happen according to his purpose.
4186000	4190320	Yeah, okay. That's fair. I mean, I was implying that in some sense. I mean,
4190880	4195280	I thought you might... I guess the question would be, where does your insistence that values are
4195280	4201520	part of the structure of being? Like, where does that find its limit? Because the classic limit
4201520	4209600	of that is something like... In fact, the definition of the utmost place of value in some sense is
4209680	4213600	almost indistinguishable from the claim that there is a god. And so...
4213600	4219520	Well, a god is not the same as an engineering god. And I take enormous pains in the book.
4219520	4224240	It costs me more than anything I've ever written to write the chapter called The Sense of the Sacred,
4224240	4232240	in which I try to help people to a place where they can understand why people use this
4232240	4238240	extraordinarily difficult word, God. You know, it's not a satisfactory term,
4238240	4244400	but it's the term we have to have to name an aspect of our experience that if we don't name it,
4244400	4250000	disappears from our lives. And that's not to say that there isn't something there that is,
4250000	4257040	that merits whatever we mean when we say divine. I mean, we haven't defined what we mean by divine.
4257040	4262160	And we're back in the nets of language. We're trapped in the nets of language, as Shelling said.
4262720	4270240	But what I'm suggesting is that, as Whitehead suggested, and come on, Whitehead was also the
4270240	4277680	co-author with Russell of the Principia Mathematica. He wasn't a fantasist. He had this, I think,
4277680	4287040	incredibly deep idea that whatever one likes to call the divinity god, whatever, is the thing that
4287520	4294960	the cosmos has relation with. Relation is at the core of being. I even argue that relation is prior
4294960	4300000	to the relata, prior to the things that are related. That sounds nonsense. How can you relate,
4300000	4304400	how can you have a relation if there isn't anything yet to relate? But there's a wonderful image called,
4305280	4311760	in Indian mythology, called Indra's net, which covers the universe. And in it, the idea is that
4312720	4318160	the filaments of the net exist before the net, before the crossing points, which are the things
4318160	4323680	we see. And on those crossing points, there are little gems, which reflect every other gem in
4323680	4328560	the net. Now, that would take a very long time to unpack, but perhaps it can set things going
4328560	4338880	in people's minds. But the idea I have is that relation is prior to anything at all, really.
4338960	4344400	And that therefore, whatever you mean by god, and whatever we mean by the cosmos,
4345120	4350320	are in some sort of dynamic relation, which is an evolving one in which the outcome is
4350320	4356000	excitingly not known. If it were known, it would all be some horrible, possibly sadistic
4357440	4364880	play by an almighty, all-knowing god. I mean, look, I'm going to be talking to Rowan Williams
4364880	4370640	shortly, but I don't want to go into all that I mean by that. I don't think god is omniscient and
4370640	4375600	omnipotent, but I don't think he's not either. Just in the same way, I don't think he's green,
4375600	4380480	and I don't think he's not green. I think the terms are wrong, but we can go there if we want,
4380480	4388240	and later or another day. But the thing, what I'm really saying is that God is discovering,
4389040	4395520	becoming unfulfilling whatever god is through the relationship, which classically in most
4395520	4401920	religions is described as love, which is after all just like a form of gravity in the world of
4402640	4407600	life and emotion rather than just in the world of the so-called inanimate.
4409200	4417040	So that therefore, we are coming into being, god is coming into being, and we're necessary to
4417040	4420880	one another's coming into being. It's not that god does a bit to us, and then we do a bit back
4420880	4426080	to god. It's like, I've read a very good book, I keep mentioning it by a young microbiologist
4426080	4433200	in America called Critishama called Interdependence, and she argues very importantly that it's not
4433200	4440400	just that, certainly it's not just that an animal or an organism molds its environment,
4440480	4444240	nor is it just good enough to recognize that while an animal
4445920	4451040	affects and shapes its environment, the environment shapes the animal or the organism,
4451600	4458080	but that this is not a, you know, turn-by-turn process. It's not that the animal shapes the
4458080	4463440	environment, it should then, in its turn, shapes the animal. It's an entirely
4464000	4469200	simultaneous process of coming into being, of co-creation, if you like. Now this idea of
4469200	4474240	simultaneous coming into being is an ancient one, but I think it's a very deep one philosophically,
4474240	4480560	and a very important one. So that accounts for your objection to the idea of the omniscient determining
4480560	4489600	god? Absolutely, absolutely, because the god would have no creation. Creation is not really just
4489600	4494240	the unfolding of something that's already there. What's the name of the book? What's the name of
4494240	4499600	the book by the microbiologist? It's just called Interdependence. It's by Kriti Sharma.
4501600	4510480	Can you spell her last name? S-H-A-R-M-A. It's quite a short read. I'm mentioning her quite a lot
4510480	4518400	these days. Okay, so let me ask you a question. So now I'm going to try to pack up what you're
4518400	4524800	doing, and so again, tell me if I'm wrong. So we have these opposed viewpoints of the world,
4524800	4531520	paradoxical viewpoints. They're expressed, they make the hemispheric differences necessary, or
4531520	4536960	there are consequences of the hemispheric differences. If there wasn't a paradox, we wouldn't need the
4536960	4542720	two hemispheres. We need these two different ways of looking at things. We've tilted, we're in danger
4542720	4550080	of tilting too far to a left hemisphere view, and that's keeping us from, from what? It's keeping us
4550080	4556320	from apprehension of the relationship with the sacred that you're describing, the co-creation
4556320	4566400	relationship. Is that, is that reasonable? Well, it's ruling out so much. I mean, I can't begin to
4566400	4573680	tell you, but you can imagine all the things that this very reduced abstract schematic bureaucratic,
4573680	4580400	essentially it's a bureaucratic, you know, you push something, it has an action on something else,
4580400	4584720	and you know, we can predict the outcome, we can organize it. That's the left hemisphere's vision
4584720	4589840	of the world, inanimate stuff that it can move about. Very much the Industrial Revolution was a
4589920	4596960	kind of acting out in the outer world of the world picture of the left hemisphere in some ways. I
4596960	4603920	talk about that more in the master and his emissary, but it's ruling out, it's ruling out, it's ruling
4603920	4611920	out everything really. It's ruling out our ability to understand, to see, to see at all. I mean,
4611920	4618160	a number of very important people, one of them Goethe said, you know, thinking is good, but seeing
4618960	4623920	is so much better. And I think we just don't see things anymore, because we don't expect them,
4623920	4628160	we don't understand them, we've ruled them out from the word go, because our world picture
4628160	4633920	just doesn't contain them. And if you stop doing that and start attending in a more flexible way,
4633920	4640800	you find there's a massively complex and fascinating, rich, nourishing response to your
4640800	4646960	attention. It's the absence of that that causes the meaning crisis, which is constantly being
4646960	4651600	bounded about. Well, the Egyptians, you know, the Egyptians knew that, the ancient Egyptians
4651600	4661520	knew that, because they, they, they, um, they're, the God Horus is the eye and its attention. And
4661520	4668720	it is Horus that revitalizes Osiris and he's the God of structure. And they saw the, the, the,
4668720	4674480	the proper sovereignty was a combination of attention and structure, a dynamic combination
4674480	4679600	of attention and structure. Well, this is absolutely brilliant. Well, I quite agree,
4679600	4685440	but this is where we come to, I need to make a correct, a possible misapprehension.
4686480	4691840	There is absolutely nothing wrong with the view of the right hemisphere. It's in fact necessary.
4691840	4697520	It's part of a, of a dialectic backwards and forwards between these two ways in which things
4697520	4702640	can be built. You can't have the one in a way without the other. You're quite right. We need
4702640	4710640	them both, but, but we live in an age which is completely obsessed with the idea of equality as
4710640	4718080	some eternal sort of truth about the cosmos. I have, I can see no evidence for this idea. It's a
4718080	4724960	lovely idea, a humanly invented idea, which is, which is a good one in society, although it can't
4724960	4730720	be realized and it may actually not be necessary or even good for it to be ultimately realized.
4730720	4737120	It might lead to a horrible kind of totalitarianism, as many 20th century philosophers pointed out, but,
4737600	4741760	but these two things don't have to be. That's the problem with elevating one virtue above all
4741760	4747600	else. It's a left hemisphere problem. Exactly. Well, it's an ideological problem. No, well, no, the
4747600	4753680	point is this. We need the left and the right, but we need the right to be in control. Now,
4753680	4757600	this is very important. This is the image of the master and his emissary, the emissary and the
4757680	4762960	master are not equal. The master needs the emissary and knows he needs the emissary. The emissary
4762960	4769600	being inferior doesn't know that he needs the master. So the emissary is good as long as he's
4769600	4775520	under the control of the master. Now, that image is extraordinarily important for understanding
4776400	4786080	this picture of the cosmos. And it's actually present in ancient Chinese, Navajo, not Navajo,
4786080	4794800	Iroquois, mythologies and so on, this idea of the being an unequal pair, that one has to be the
4794800	4801600	guardian of the other. And as long as the one that is, as it were, a potential problem remains
4801600	4807760	under the supervision of the wiser one that sees all everything works well for everybody. And that's
4807760	4813280	why in the master and his emissary, I suggest with three periods in the West, in early Greek
4813280	4817920	civilization, in the peak of Roman civilization, and again at the Renaissance in the West,
4817920	4823280	where these were working well together. But in every case, it slid further to the viewpoint of
4823280	4828160	the left hemisphere. And in every case, the civilization has crumbled. And I see the evidence
4828160	4835600	for that all around me now. So I'm not saying that we just need these two things. I'm saying we
4835600	4841520	definitely need them both. Neither of them is bad. But what is bad is for the
4842400	4848160	the inferior one, the one that sees less to take control. And it's very easy for it to take control
4848160	4853200	because like the less intelligent person that thinks it knows everything, he thinks I've got it,
4853200	4857440	I've understood it. There's no more, you know, we do three more experiments and we've cracked
4857440	4862480	the universe, you know, it's all just a matter of, you know, a few years of science and we'll
4862480	4870160	understand that. Let me let you in on some of the things I've been grappling with here. So
4870160	4877680	I talked, I talked to Matt Ridley and Bjorn Lauburg recently, and their enthusiastic
4878240	4885120	Enlightenment rationalists, I would say there, they look at what's happened as a consequence of
4885120	4889200	the Industrial Revolution and the tremendous technological advances that that's produced
4889200	4895200	and the immense increase in human well-being. And they say we can continue with that into the
4895200	4901200	future. We can produce a world and perhaps are already producing a world where poverty is
4901200	4905440	increasingly going to be a thing of the past. And we can bring the rest of the world up to the
4905440	4910960	standards of living that characterize the West and and we can continue to expand the pie. And
4910960	4917280	I'm not interested in discussing whether that's possible or not, because it's possibly possible
4917280	4923920	and possibly not. But it's a particular vision, right? It's a vision of the extension of material
4923920	4930320	comfort to everyone. And that comfort has been extended tremendously over the last two or 300
4930320	4935040	years. It's absolutely amazing. And I would say in large part, it's a consequence of that left
4935040	4941840	hemisphere reduction of the world to manageable bits and the manipulation of it. And this is
4941840	4947120	not to say anything negative about your thesis whatsoever. But one of the things I've noticed
4947200	4953360	is that that materialistic utopian vision, and I'm also not insulting Ridley or Lambert, who I
4953360	4958880	admire greatly, that materialistic vision of incremental material progress has very little
4959440	4967360	motive power. It isn't an exciting story for some reason. What do we want? Incremental
4967360	4974000	improvement. When do we want it? In due time. It's not a gripping story. It's lacking something. And
4974960	4982960	you seem to be pushing towards something that might be the medication for that lack.
4983920	4990960	There's nothing in that vision that speaks of a grand destiny for the individual, for society.
4990960	4997520	And there are many religious traditions that insist that human beings exist in a relationship
4997600	5004640	with the divine, and that it's only in living out that relationship that life is imbued with
5004640	5011200	the proper kind of meaning. And proper means sufficient to keep you from malevolence, I suppose,
5011200	5017120	and sufficient to be in love with life. Now, you posited in some of your statements a while back
5017120	5025520	that we're in this co-creation relationship with the divine. And that isn't too far off from my
5025520	5033040	understanding of many classical religious propositions that human beings participate in the
5033040	5038080	act of creation. Whether we participate in the act of creating God is a whole different question,
5038080	5048800	but we can leave that aside. So then the question is, what's the question that arises out of that?
5049760	5056480	I'm still trying to drive down at exactly what the main point you're making. You've worked on
5056480	5062480	this book for a tremendous amount of time. Something's driving you hard. And it's the revelation of a
5062480	5068400	solution to a very important problem. And the revelation seems to be something like an attempt
5068400	5078000	to explicate a higher-order vision, something that we can aspire to. And
5078720	5085520	the drive to this is that I don't think that we live in an enlightened
5086640	5093440	era. We live in what David Bohm called an endarkened era, in which what we think is enlightening us is
5093440	5101520	in fact inducing misery. The strange thing is that, unarguably, when people are enormously
5102480	5108800	poverty-stricken, and of course one needs then to define what poverty is, are people who lead
5110640	5116640	the lives that their ancestors have lived as hunter-gatherers. Are they poor? Or do they only
5116640	5121600	become poor when their whole world is ripped apart and they're brought into the nearest large
5121600	5127440	industrial slum and have no bearings on the life, no relationship with the world, no pride,
5127440	5131600	and their health suffers and they kill themselves. So what is poverty? That is a very
5132160	5137840	important question first. But also remedying poverty, extreme poverty, is of course enormously
5137840	5147600	important. No feeling person could argue against that. But it's not enough. One rather well-known
5147600	5154640	historical figure said, man cannot live by bread alone. And the thing is that there's only bread
5154640	5162240	in this story. But that leaves out everything. Peter Cook, he plays the part of a publisher who
5162240	5170240	says, the trouble with your book is that it lacks everything. And I feel that this kind of philosophy
5170240	5175120	lacks absolutely everything. It's got nothing whatever to offer. Now let me just put some
5175120	5181040	facts to this because it may sound, you know, it's just my opinion. What do we know? Well,
5181040	5187680	fortunately, going back to the 30s, school children in America in a certain system have
5187680	5195520	been asked the same questions about their happiness in life at the same age, going back now 70 years.
5195520	5203120	And Gene Twenge, who has looked at this data, which avoids all sorts of problems of defining
5203120	5209600	what you mean by happy and, you know, retrospector scopes and all the rest, you've got the data from
5209600	5221680	the 1930s, the 40s, the 50s. And nowadays, the numbers of children that would qualify by a very
5221680	5230320	well authenticated and commonly used standard as being depressed is five to eight times what it was
5230320	5238480	in the 1930s when poverty was a big issue. So five or eight times, not five or eight percent more.
5238560	5243840	So there's something horrendous we're doing to ourselves. Suicide rates are going up,
5244640	5249200	particularly among women who register much greater dissatisfaction with life now than
5249200	5255040	they did 20 years ago, interestingly, because one might think that a number of things that
5255040	5259920	would have made life hard for them have been removed. But it just shows how complicated it is
5259920	5266320	knowing what works well for people. And three things overall, three things seem to be incredibly
5266320	5272640	important for human fulfillment and happiness. And one of them I touched on at the end of the
5272640	5279040	master and his emissary, which is feeling socially connected, being bound into a meaningful community
5279040	5287280	of trust. That's one. The second is being in the presence of nature. Just going off for half an
5287280	5293280	hour into a forest and being quiet has an effect on your blood pressure, on your physical health,
5293360	5297520	and so on. And these effects, if practiced, are greater than those in going to the gym.
5298400	5304560	And the thing that really struck me is there in Oxford, there is the Oxford Handbook of Religion,
5304560	5311360	I think it's called, but it looks at enormous bodies of evidence about the well-being of people who
5311360	5318320	are adherents to a religion and those who are not. And not only, as you very well might expect,
5319040	5326080	the people who are not adherents to religion, much more prone to anxiety, depression, drug
5326080	5333040	addiction, they cope less well with crisis, they're more vulnerable generally. But
5334160	5339520	they're actually physically not so well. So for example, rates of stroke, of heart disease,
5340000	5347120	are comparably better amongst the believing group than the unbelieving group,
5347760	5353520	with the difference between those who do cardio exercise for several hours a day.
5354480	5360640	And even smoking, it's a more powerful effect than smoking. Social connectedness is more
5360720	5365040	powerful than smoking. Being in nature, I think, is more powerful than smoking. And
5366880	5375600	being a part of a religious community that worships and even holding spiritual or religious views,
5375600	5383440	to some extent, is a mitigator against unhappiness and illness. So is that any answer to your question
5383680	5390240	of why, you know, why I don't think that Matt Ridley's idea of it's totally left-handed idea,
5390240	5395440	we just sort of crank out some more government departments, do some marvelous technical things
5395440	5400640	and everybody gets to be living in a fantasy land of happiness. I don't believe this.
5400640	5404960	Well, I don't think he believes that. I mean, he's a complicated person and
5406480	5412240	he's more concerned with applying material resources where they could be most effectively
5412240	5418800	applied. I think the question of what material comfort and plenitude needs to be embedded in
5418800	5423600	is a different question. I think it's reasonable to say, well, we should do what we can to alleviate
5424400	5431600	destitution and catastrophic poverty. We should improve child nutrition. We should eradicate
5431600	5438080	tuberculosis. Obviously, right. The question is, what does that have to be nested inside for it to
5438080	5446720	be worthwhile? And so that's what you're aiming at. And I believe, what does that need to be
5446720	5451360	nested in to make it worthwhile? And you've come to this conclusion, was this a shock to you over
5451360	5458240	the years that you came to the conclusion that, okay, why not? I mean, the reason I'm asking is because
5459280	5466160	it isn't an everyday occurrence, in some sense, for a committed scientist to point out that
5466720	5473760	the scientific viewpoint needs to be embedded inside a broader, what, value oriented viewpoint?
5473760	5478160	It's something I believe, but it isn't an everyday occurrence for that to be stated forthrightly. And
5478160	5483600	as a scientist, it isn't necessarily the first thing that would come to mind. Like, have you always
5483600	5489760	thought this way or have you come to this as a consequence of your thinking? Well, I have the
5489840	5497520	advantage of having come to science from a fairly thorough grounding in the humanities. So I had a
5497520	5507040	philosophy of life that was based on reading, thinking, talking. And I was a relatively
5507920	5515280	aged customer when I started to study medicine, compared with most people who do that,
5516240	5524720	at least in this country. So I brought a background which has always been my passion,
5524720	5532640	an interest in philosophy, but not just a kind of forever analytic philosophy in which you
5533440	5538000	is more or less like sort of angels dancing on a pinhead and breaking everything down to
5538000	5543120	the tiniest parts. This doesn't really particularly interest me, but a kind of more human philosophy
5543600	5550800	which doesn't become theology, but which is open to the idea that there is more
5551360	5558240	in the world than we can know or understand. But it does sound like it is, that it has become
5558880	5564160	theology. This isn't a critique. Like, it's an attempt to observe what you're telling me. It's
5564160	5571520	not a critique at all. I'm trying to understand this. Well, it depends what you mean by theology.
5572080	5577520	I don't think the most important part of a relationship with God is necessarily theology.
5577520	5587280	I'm not disrespectful of theology, but I've read a lot of, for example,
5588160	5595840	the Kabbalah. I've acquainted myself with Buddhist philosophy and I've always been very interested
5595840	5603600	in Taoism, Hinduism, and the deep wisdom of these things, including, as I say,
5603600	5610960	North American native people and even circumpolar people. I mean, the wisdom is embodied in their
5610960	5618000	mythologies. We think of these as somehow childish myths, but in fact, these myths contain, and in
5618000	5622720	fact, are the only way of containing or not containing because they're not ever contained,
5622720	5631200	but of transmitting, bringing into being for other people the things that are the deep truths.
5631200	5638480	And it's that that motivated me. I'm not going to be alive much longer. I mean, I'm not in
5638480	5645040	imminent danger of dying, but I mean, we're all actually here for an extraordinarily short time,
5645040	5649440	and there was great wisdom in the past in having a memento mori on your desk, a skull.
5649920	5657040	And we're not here for very long. And it behaves us to behave and to understand the world in the
5657040	5662000	most fruitful way for human fulfillment and happiness and for the greater fulfillment
5662000	5668800	of whatever it is that we sense in whatever is around us, in the being of the world. And,
5669360	5674400	you know, the word cosmos keeps coming to mind, which also in its root means beautiful, because I
5674400	5680080	think what one sees when one looks at the natural order is that it is as scientists and
5680080	5685920	mathematicians are constantly saying it's outstandingly beautiful, complex and orderly.
5685920	5692240	Why? Where does that come from? Well, I don't pretend to have an answer, but I see the difference
5692800	5698000	is between people who think they know the answer and people who don't. I'm one of the people who
5698000	5703120	don't think they know the answer. So please don't ask me what the answer is. I think I would disqualify
5703120	5708800	myself from having anything worthwhile to say if I thought I had the answer. The difference in life
5708800	5719040	is not between atheists on the one hand and believers on the other, but it's between fundamentalist
5719040	5725040	believers and fundamentalist atheists on the one hand and people who often call themselves honest
5725040	5729840	diagnostics on the other. That openness of mind, that willingness to acknowledge that one doesn't
5729840	5734640	know everything, that one's reaching and searching for something is far more fruitful and spiritual
5734640	5738560	to me than saying I know it, it's written down in this book and these are the rules.
5741360	5748160	The, I want to go back to the, I listen to all of that and I want to go back to the
5749040	5757120	this co-creation idea, because that's not a trivial idea. That's an overwhelmingly
5757760	5767680	massive idea. And it, see, I've, the audience, I've talked, the audiences I've talked with,
5768240	5778960	I've talked about the necessity of a vision of life that's sufficiently demanding, meaningful
5779520	5789360	to justify the trouble of existence. And you, it seems to me that it's necessary psychologically
5789360	5797440	to be in pursuit of a noble goal. And there isn't a goal that's more noble than the one that you
5797440	5807920	outlined virtually by definition, right? I mean, if, if you're co-creating the cosmos, but also
5808000	5815200	if you're in a co-creating relationship with God, that involves you at the highest level of being,
5815200	5828160	with the structure of being. Well, I, you know, again, because we're talking
5829120	5835360	inevitably in shorthand because this is why this book is so colossally long. I mean,
5838480	5845360	it's apparently as long as the Bible. The reason I had to do that is that I'm, what I'm doing is,
5845360	5851440	is nothing less than this. I'm saying the whole way in which you are taught by your education,
5851440	5859840	by science, popular science, not by, you know, quantum physicists who have a very much more
5859840	5866080	sophisticated grasp of philosophy, but by the sort of 19th century mechanism who still dominate
5866080	5875120	biology unhappily, a version of some engineering, if you ever like. This is not a good way to think.
5875120	5885520	This is not even likely to be true. It doesn't answer to any aspect of experience of the world,
5885520	5891600	except the most tinnily detailed. So for example, what I think is that the whole structure of things
5891600	5897760	is infinitely complex and has many recurring loops in it. And when you try, and it just an organism
5897760	5905280	is like that, or even a cell, or even, you know, part of a cell, an organelle, is amazingly complex
5905280	5910720	that the number of interactions, the number of chemical reactions that are going on there is
5910720	5918160	colossal and they all have cascades that interact with one another. However, if you take from this
5918160	5924480	very large picture right down to the tiniest, tiniest bit of light, you can see a little chain of
5924480	5928960	arrows. This leads to that, leads to that. You can't see that all kinds of other things going on.
5928960	5934000	And you can identify that. And that's what we're good at doing. And we say, if I interfere in that,
5934000	5939840	I can cause something to happen, which might be beneficial, for example, to somebody who has a
5939840	5946240	health condition. So I'm not saying there's anything wrong with any of this. Again, I come back to
5946240	5950480	there's nothing wrong with the left hemisphere. There's only something wrong with it when it
5951040	5958480	adopts the hubristic cloak of knowing everything. And when you said scientists are not often heard to
5959920	5965920	voice the sort of things that I'm saying and that you are saying, I'd like to say that physicists
5965920	5972880	very often do, but that biologists relatively less often do now, although in the early part
5972880	5979920	of the century, there were many great biologists such as J.B.S. Haldane, his father, John Scott Haldane,
5979920	5988880	Conrad Havre, Wollington, Ludwig von Vettelansi in Austria, who saw a very sophisticated vision
5988880	5994000	of the living world of biology. But what happened was, because there were great
5995040	6002160	successes in molecular engineering after the war, this vision, which as I say is technically
6002160	6007360	correct, that you can interfere as a detail and do something very valuable. But the mistake is to
6007360	6012720	extrapolate from that, to say this is the structure of the whole thing we're looking at. It's not,
6012720	6018480	it's not like that. The least eight or nine ways in which an living being is not like a machine.
6019040	6024720	So I am sorry that scientists diminish themselves by adopting this very narrow vision
6025280	6029760	of what life is. Because after all, the whole point of science as Schrodinger said
6029760	6033760	is to answer the question, who are we? And if it's not answering that question, and it's not
6033760	6040320	assumable into an answer to that question, it's not really getting us to what the meaning of our
6040320	6046160	life demands from us. That we have not an answer to the question, who are we? Not an answer to the
6046160	6051520	question, what is the meaning of life? Of course, by definition, there isn't one. But the very knowledge
6051520	6057840	that we have to strive for it and not lose sight of it is very, very important. There's a saying in
6057840	6065040	the Midrash, you are, you're not obliged to finish the work, but you are not permitted to cease from
6065040	6071200	it. And I think that is, I mean, I would say that is my vision of what I do. I think it's what all
6072080	6077520	seekers after truth have to do, whether they're philosophers or scientists. And you know, I
6077520	6084880	would love science to be more scientific. The curious thing is I honor science deeply. And I
6084880	6091680	think that it has nothing to lose by making, you know, being a little bit humbler than it is by
6091680	6097360	accepting that there was a lot that is deeply puzzling and that the more we know about physics,
6097360	6102880	for example, the more we understand what we don't know. And it's not scientific to rule out certain
6102880	6109920	ways of thinking to say that thinking in terms of organic holes in terms of gestalt, gestalt and so
6109920	6115920	forth is somehow not scientific. No, it's just not the way that a certain very narrow form of
6115920	6122800	sciences practice. And I want science before I die to become more open as science should be,
6122800	6128560	to be more questing, more imaginative. You know, in writing this book, I've had a lot to do with
6128560	6134640	the story of how scientists made their discoveries, how mathematicians made their discoveries. And
6134640	6139200	they very rarely, if ever, as George Gaylord Simpson himself said, you know, one of the great
6139200	6146080	mainstream molecular biologists of the last century, it's very rare that they make them by
6146080	6150800	following the scientific method. The scientific method is a retrospective thing that is fitted
6150800	6157600	on to what actually happens, which is extraordinary insights of intuition, seeing shapes, testing
6157600	6163440	them out, of course, which is a scientific method, of course. But it's not this kind of boring,
6164400	6166960	rule-bound thing that it's often made out to be.
6168640	6173360	Well, I think with that statement, that's a good place to end for today.
6175200	6182720	It was a nice conclusion, gone for an hour and a half or so. And I appreciate...
6182720	6183360	It's all right with me.
6184400	6189840	Very much you talking with me. Hopefully we can do this again. I want to get further through your
6189840	6196400	book. I'll keep everybody posted as to the progress of the book and to where they can obtain it
6196400	6202160	when that becomes possible. Is there anything else that you wanted to mention today
6202160	6205360	that you want to bring up before we close?
6206880	6212640	Well, no. I mean, I want to say first of all, which I haven't really had an opportunity to say,
6212640	6220080	how enormously glad I am that you are back in debate with us all. And long may that be.
6221360	6227760	And I do... I think the conversations we have are good. I hope other people may think that too.
6229520	6231120	Well, we're going to put that to the test.
6232800	6237680	And I'd like to just draw people's attention to the fact that in the last six months,
6238640	6243600	it is six months, I think, six or seven months, we've developed something called Channel McGilchrist,
6243600	6249280	which is a place on the internet where you can find out more about my stuff. You can see
6250640	6257200	talks, lectures, podcasts, things I've done, what I'm... And generally keep up to date. There's a
6257200	6262960	forum there where you can enter into and discuss my work. There's a place where you can ask questions
6263040	6269680	off me. So once a month, I answer four questions out of a list of things that members of the...
6269680	6273200	Because you can either be a non-member or a member. But if you're a member, you can ask me
6273200	6279360	a question, which I will then spend a quarter of an hour answering. So that's my attempt to try and
6280160	6284640	give back something that isn't just the odd book every 10 years. So...
6286000	6289760	Well, we'll make sure that we put the links and all of that in the description of this video.
6290560	6294960	And with any luck, we'll get a chance to talk again in the future after we've both digested this
6295760	6301360	and this conversation. It was really good to see you again.
6301360	6304960	Oh, and you. Thank you.
