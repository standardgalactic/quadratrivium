0	2400	You should accept yourself just the way you are.
2400	5360	What does that say about who I should become?
5360	8960	Is that just now off the table because I'm already good enough in every way?
8960	10800	So am I done or something?
10800	11760	Get the hell up.
12320	13760	Get your act together.
13760	15600	Adopt some responsibility.
15600	16880	Put your life together.
16880	18160	Develop a vision.
18160	22640	Unfold all those manifold possibilities that lurk within.
22640	24480	Be a force for good in the world,
24480	26240	and that'll be the adventure of your life.
30240	36240	The world's falling birth rate isn't on the list of major threats to life as we know it,
36240	37440	but it soon will be.
38480	40240	Taxes are decent as soar,
40240	42720	pension systems will become unsustainable,
42720	45280	while our healthcare systems won't be able to cope
45280	47840	with the race of old people to take care of
47840	50400	compared to the shrinking number of taxpayers.
50400	53040	Businesses will struggle to find workers to hire,
53040	54720	school closures will accelerate,
54720	57520	while social care will continually be sliced.
57520	60240	And they say it's an economic time bomb.
60240	61520	I'm worried about the birth rate.
61520	64960	Most people think we have like too many people on the planet,
64960	67360	but actually this is an outdated view.
67360	71920	I think that the biggest problem the world will face in 20 years is population collapse.
72880	73680	Collapse.
73680	75120	I want to emphasize this.
75120	79200	The biggest issue in 20 years will be population collapse.
88000	98720	Hello everyone, I'm here today talking to Mr. Stephen Jay Shaw.
99520	103840	Stephen is a British national who has studied and lived on three continents.
103840	107440	He trained as a computer engineer and then as a data scientist
108080	113200	before starting his first film project, BirthGap, at age 49.
114080	119280	He maintains the position of president of the data analytics company he co-founded,
119280	121920	Autometrics Analytics LLC.
123200	129200	Stephen holds an MBA graduate business degree from ISG in Paris, France,
129200	132160	and is continuing his studies at the Harvard Extension School.
132800	137680	Looking very much forward today to delving into the issue of declining
137920	144160	birth rates and population collapse, something that's not particularly on everyone's rate,
144160	151360	are and the issue of the invisible epidemic of unplanned childlessness.
152640	155040	Why are people having so few children?
156080	160640	The more I read about falling birth rates, everything was negative.
161360	165040	You enter a downward spiral as you have fewer and fewer children.
165520	170960	You have fewer and fewer future mothers, which in turn goes on and on and on.
172320	176640	And no society in history has been known to come out of that spiral.
178000	183600	So I'm talking today with Stephen Jay Shaw, who's produced a documentary,
183600	189760	BirthGap, that was originally released in its first version in 2021 and later version in 2022.
189760	194560	And he's been spending an awful lot of time delving into this particular problem.
194640	196960	And so we're going to walk through what he's learned.
198240	199200	Good to see you.
199200	200720	Thank you for inviting me.
200720	202320	Hey, thanks for agreeing to talk.
202320	205280	So let's start with your background.
206000	209840	We could walk through what you've been up to biographically,
209840	211120	first of all, to situate it.
211120	215920	And then you can expand on that to the degree that you're willing to enable.
215920	221840	So historically, for the last 20 years, I've been involved in data analytics,
221840	223520	what we now call data science.
224160	226720	I'm a part statistician, part coder.
227440	231120	Worked with some great academics and PhDs that we have on staff
231120	236000	and coming up with academic models, forecasting models for industries,
236000	237760	mainly in the automotive sector.
237760	240080	We try and do short-term forecasting.
240080	241680	What might people purchase?
242720	244640	What should car companies build?
244640	246000	What should they market?
246000	249680	What should they give for incentives done to a very minute level?
249680	250960	This is a private venture?
250960	251520	It is.
252320	254400	So it's a corporation that offers these services?
254400	257520	Yeah, it's a small niche corporation that's been offering services
257520	260080	to the world's largest corporations for 20 years.
260080	261840	And how did you get involved in that?
261840	264240	It was a startup in London 20 years ago.
264240	266400	I personally moved to the US to...
266400	268480	We got a contract with Nissan North America.
269040	269920	It took me to LA.
269920	275760	And following that, yeah, I spent like 15 years following that company hands-on
276720	278160	until around 2015.
279600	280320	Bizarrely.
281040	283920	And I should explain that my lifelong learner had gone.
283920	289360	I got accepted into Harvard Extension School to become a degree candidate
289360	291600	to keep my data science skills up to date.
292400	298000	And I was presented with some data that I just couldn't believe on falling birth rates.
298720	303280	So as someone who is involved in forecasting, albeit short-term forecasting,
303680	310480	realizing that we've got this fundamental problem with birth rates that's ultimately
310480	314000	going to affect, well, not just the number of potential car buyers.
314000	316080	I mean, that's the smallest problem in this overall.
316080	318960	But that was something I felt almost ashamed of.
318960	320080	Why do I know this?
320080	324320	And then you expand that to what is this going to mean for the planet?
324320	330000	And as a father or three, my three children were just about still teenagers then,
330240	336720	I felt a sense of failure that I hadn't been preparing my children for the world
336720	338160	they were about to enter into.
339280	343120	You know, we all, I think, are led into the belief that sure,
343120	347040	that the world's population is growing perhaps exponentially still.
347040	350720	That's what I would have said at that time, based on what I was learning.
351440	358160	And I had no idea that the actual dynamics of everything from
358640	363440	how work is going to be like, to how society is going to be like,
363440	368720	to how pension systems are going to be like, is fundamentally flawed.
369680	374160	And at that moment, I realized something's wrong, because you know what?
374160	379440	The same trend was showing up for Germany and Italy and Japan.
380240	381280	South Korea.
381280	384000	Yeah, well, South Korea was just a little bit later,
384000	386480	just a little bit later, which was interesting.
386560	391600	But something triggered in the early 1970s in Japan, Germany, Italy,
391600	394560	and you can add Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Austria,
395440	399280	to cause a series of parallel trends.
399280	405440	And yet, what I was reading from experts was that these are localized problems.
406160	408080	Japan, it's work like balance.
408080	411040	That in Germany, it's something called Rabenmutter,
411040	415040	which is the idea that parts of Germany, even today,
415040	418160	for a woman to have a child and go straight back to work,
418160	420560	is really something that culturally shouldn't be done.
421200	424400	So that might cause some people to delay parenthood.
425440	431280	In Spain and Italy, it was down to high unemployment among the youth.
431280	433840	Other areas, it was gender balance, et cetera.
433840	437600	So all these localized reasons were being proposed.
438480	441920	For me, as a data scientist, you could see clearly,
441920	445120	and if I can give you an analogy, it's one of your own.
445120	447680	You were talking to Lex Freeman.
447680	450800	He talked about the dragon, I think, in terms of the environment context.
450800	453680	If someone finds a dragon and they scream, there's a dragon.
454320	458160	And I love the analogy, and I since saw that you use dragons quite a lot,
458160	459520	so I thought, I might too.
460320	463600	And it's like you found this little dragon in Japan,
463600	467520	and the same kind of dragon in Germany and Italy at the same time,
468080	469840	and they're starting to get bigger, and I saw.
469840	471520	So they're lizards to begin with.
471520	472720	Right. I mean, they're tiny.
472720	475360	They're the size of a kitten, I think, is an analogy I saw.
476160	478960	And they're getting bigger, and then suddenly they're appearing
479520	483600	in other neighboring countries, and it's growing, growing, growing from there.
483600	487840	So the idea that these are localized issues to me just did not make sense.
487840	490400	So why do you think you were struck to begin with
490960	494960	by the fact that birth rates were plateauing or declining?
494960	500160	I mean, because the typical response to that would be either, so what?
500240	504320	There's too many people on the planet anyways, or actually, it's a net good.
504320	507200	So now you said you're in a private company.
507200	509680	Now, I should let everybody watching and listening know that
511120	514640	one of the markers for the trustworthiness of a data analytic company
514640	517200	is that people will actually pay for their information.
517920	524800	And so it doesn't necessarily mean that a private data analytic company is credible,
524800	528720	but it does mean at least that they've been able to demonstrate their credibility enough
528720	532400	so that they have paying customers, and that's not an easy thing to manage.
532400	537200	And so you were doing short-term forecasting that was integrated into the capitalist economy,
537200	540960	let's say, to help people plan their product development and so forth.
540960	546480	But you came across this data at a much broader level indicating plateauing birth rate,
546480	548320	or population growth.
548320	549600	Why did that disturb you?
549600	551120	Why did you think that was a problem?
552400	556880	Because birth rates less than replacement level spiral downwards.
557440	558240	They never stop.
559120	564240	If you have fewer children than are required to replace the parents generation,
564240	569360	once that generation grows up, unless birth rates change,
570480	573360	which they don't historically, they stay low once they're low,
573360	574960	you're going to have fewer people again.
575760	578400	So you see it as a positive feedback loop?
578400	578800	It is.
579440	584960	And when you then look up, well, you want to find examples of societies
584960	587440	coming from low birth rates going back to replacement level,
587440	589840	and you realize there are no examples.
589840	593680	In fact, there's no known historical examples anywhere.
594800	599360	Do we have enough of a historical track to consider that a concern?
600720	606400	In modern times, if you look at the number of countries who've fallen to birth rates of 1.7,
606400	612960	1.6, 1.5, when you have no single example of a country going back to replacement level,
612960	614080	we should be concerned.
614080	615600	In fact, we should be very concerned.
616400	620160	I know places like Quebec, for example, in Canada with very, very low birth rate,
620160	624880	have tried to institute government policies that, for example,
624880	629760	make daycare in principle more accessible to young women and young families,
629760	633040	although that's had pretty much zero impact on the outcome.
633040	637120	I know that Hungary has put forward a series of policy transformations
637120	638560	on the family support front.
638560	642480	And my belief is, from what I've read,
642480	648560	is that they've at least stopped the birth rate decrease and increased it slightly.
649120	651760	So that's the only—I mean, Quebec didn't work at all.
651760	654880	Hungary looks like there's some—they're still way below replacement,
654880	658400	so it hasn't rectified the problem in any sense.
661360	662400	Here's the deal.
662400	666800	The government keeps raising rates because it's the only tool they have to keep inflation
666800	669120	under control, and it's not working.
669120	671600	You can't spend your way out of inflation.
671600	673440	You've seen the impact on the stock market,
673440	675920	and you've seen the impact on your savings.
675920	680640	Hedge inflation by owning gold, whether physical gold and silver in your safe
680640	683120	or through an IRA in precious metals,
683120	687280	where you can hold real gold and silver in a tax-sheltered retirement account.
687280	690160	Buy gold and get a free safe to store it in.
690160	693360	That's right, on qualifying purchases from Birch Gold Group,
693360	697840	now through March 31st, they'll ship a free safe directly to your door.
697840	702640	Just text Jordan to 989898 to get your free info kit on gold
702640	705600	and to claim eligibility for your free safe.
705600	708080	Then talk to one of their precious metals specialists.
708080	711520	That's Jordan to 989898 today.
715440	723040	What's fascinating about Hungary was what I wanted to do was look at something much deeper
723360	726960	than the typical birth rate numbers that we see today.
726960	728160	I'm trying to change that.
728880	732720	If you look deeper, you can find data that if you merge together,
732720	735200	which I don't believe anyone had ever done before,
735200	736720	that gives you two measures.
737360	742960	One is of societal childlessness, and the other is family structure.
744400	749280	So the traditional way to measure childlessness is to wait to women,
749280	754240	or 45 usually, and have some surveys, maybe a census.
754240	758560	So you're waiting to the end of the fertility window and counting them then.
758560	763120	What I wanted to see was what is the societal challenges today
763120	766400	if there's reduction in the number of women starting to have families
766400	767760	compared to what you would expect.
768320	769840	We should be able to track that now.
769840	773360	So looking at Hungary, which I've just been doing recently,
773360	774080	was fascinating.
774080	777520	I mean, they're giving huge incentives for people to have three and four children.
778160	781760	But the family structure in Hungary is not changing at all.
782320	782960	At all.
782960	787840	What is changing, which may or may not be linked, it's associative in some way,
789120	792240	but cause what we don't know, is the childlessness rate,
792240	794320	and Hungary does seem to be going down.
794320	798160	More people look like they're starting to have families.
798160	800560	And what happens then is when people start to have families,
800560	803440	they go on because family structure is locked in globally.
803440	804320	That's another finding.
805120	806800	And so what do you mean?
806800	807920	So we'll go in two directions.
807920	808720	What do you mean?
808720	810800	What are you speaking about when you're talking,
810800	813280	when you're expressing your concerns about family structure?
813840	817360	Well, family structure, basically, is the percentage of women.
817360	819760	We say women because we've got so much data on women,
819760	821680	but really we should think of men and women.
824000	829120	The proportion of women couples who have one child,
829120	832080	or two, or three, or four, or five, or more.
832800	838240	And if you take data for Japan, and you look at 1973,
839280	841200	right before the fall in birth rates,
842160	845120	the percentages of women having one, two, three, four
845120	847440	are identical today, as they were then.
847440	851120	6% of women in 1973 were having four more children.
851120	853600	Today, it's the exact same number, 6%.
854720	857760	So our focus has been completely,
858720	862080	if we've been in a fog looking at overall birth rates,
863040	868000	what you find is in Japan in 1974, interesting year,
868640	872960	an explosion in childlessness, which went from 3% to 6%
873520	877680	to 15% to 21% to 30% plus percent in a space of about four years.
878240	880560	The same in Italy, the same in Germany.
880560	881280	In four years.
881280	883280	In four years, it's a shock.
883280	885040	It was what I call a baby shock.
886000	888080	And then if you look at Korea, South Korea,
888080	890320	which you mentioned earlier, if we take South Korea,
890960	894080	mid-90s, right in the midst of a currency shock,
894080	898480	you see, childless rates were already maybe 15% there.
898480	901040	Suddenly, it goes up to, I believe, 30%.
901040	902240	And now it's over 40%.
902240	903760	And this is childless at what age?
904320	908400	Well, when I estimate childlessness,
909040	913040	I'm taking, for the given population of women,
913040	915440	the number of births you'd expect to have at any age
916000	918000	and saying, how many first-time mothers were there?
918800	920960	And when you count up the number of first-time mothers
920960	925040	of any age group and look at the overall population structure,
925040	926400	you can see, well, wait a minute,
926400	930080	there's a gap opening up here compared to the number you would expect.
930640	932960	So this is like age agnostic, in a sense.
933920	936240	And as a measure, people would say,
936240	940160	well, some of those women might, there might be a boom in the future.
940160	942560	People might be just delaying, but that doesn't happen.
942640	944880	There's no example of those booms ever happening.
946240	949600	So it seems to be we've got this cycle going on
951200	954560	that people are pulled quite quickly into this,
956880	960640	what I call, world of unplanned childlessness, if I can.
960640	962560	I've had to coin quite a few phrases here.
963520	967680	And I should explain what it might mean by unplanned childlessness.
968640	973200	If you look at surveys, look at research,
973920	976720	the vast majority of people want children.
977280	977920	It's innate.
979360	981120	And some don't.
981120	982240	That's clear.
982240	984800	What percentage do approximately?
984800	987040	I'm estimating around 5% don't.
987040	989280	There have been Gallup polls in the U.S. done.
989280	990960	Is that different between men and women?
992080	993120	I don't have that data.
993120	993520	Okay.
993520	996560	So 5% you figure are out of the game?
996560	996800	Yes.
996800	998160	By voluntary choice.
998160	998720	Yes.
998720	998960	Right.
998960	1001840	And what percentage are childless?
1001840	1004400	Well, right now we're looking at 30% to 40%
1004400	1005440	the most developed nations.
1005440	1009600	So the vast majority, 80%, it's estimated in studies.
1010320	1011120	And I think this...
1011120	1014160	So that's that involuntary childlessness.
1014720	1016080	And I've been thinking about that lately.
1016080	1021120	We have this notion for men of involuntary celibacy in cells.
1021120	1026400	We don't have a term that's at hand for involuntary childlessness
1026480	1027440	among women.
1027440	1029200	And it hasn't been recognized as a...
1029920	1031200	Like what would you call it?
1031200	1034480	A universal social problem.
1034480	1037600	But you just said 5% of women don't want children
1037600	1040080	but 30% don't have them.
1040080	1043040	And so there's a huge gap there between desire and reality.
1043920	1047600	So I think frankly, I believe it's the biggest
1047600	1049920	societal problem that we have.
1049920	1053200	And it's hiding because we haven't recognized it.
1053200	1056160	And if you find people, as I did making the documentary,
1056640	1063840	people who are struggling, 30s, late 30s, women particularly,
1063840	1065920	but men too, who've given up in their 40s
1066720	1068240	and they're opening their heart to you
1068240	1070000	with a level of what they call grief.
1071280	1075600	And in English language, grief is used for one particular context.
1075600	1079280	It's not necessarily used normally for something you never had.
1079280	1084000	I think in other languages, there are terms that encompass that.
1084000	1085200	But it's the same emotion.
1085920	1088320	And I've been pulled into conversations where
1089040	1094800	I have frankly been brought myself to the depths of understanding the suffering
1094800	1098400	from these people who thought they were going through life,
1098400	1102400	getting the education, starting the career path, probably.
1103280	1105920	Thinking that, well, you know what, I'm not 30 yet.
1106640	1108000	I've got time to meet a partner.
1109280	1113120	And then getting to the point of often, there is no partner.
1113200	1115520	Or that biology gets in the way.
1115520	1118160	Yeah, well, it turns out that life is shorter than people think.
1119360	1124000	I've had clinical clients who followed that path.
1124000	1127360	And some of them were women who had initially decided
1127360	1129120	that they didn't want to have children
1129120	1132400	and then changed their minds quite dramatically in their late 20s,
1132400	1136000	which is a very common pattern, and then couldn't have children.
1136000	1138320	And it was just absolutely disastrous for them.
1138320	1142880	They were often on the artificial fertility route for 10 years
1142880	1145520	with multiple miscarriages and failures on that front.
1145520	1147280	And it's a bloody dismal outcome.
1172960	1181840	I think if you caught me at the right day in my 20s,
1181840	1185920	when I was very in love or excited about a partner,
1185920	1187040	I would say yes.
1188320	1191920	But if you were to pry into that, I might say,
1191920	1194720	I don't know, that seems crazy to have a kid in my 20s.
1203600	1207520	Okay, so you're making a case here.
1208080	1211280	You're making a psychological case in some sense at the moment
1211280	1215120	in that this is a phenomenon worth attending to,
1215120	1219360	because the vast majority of people who end up childless,
1219360	1222720	which is a more serious immediate problem for women
1222720	1226000	because of the biological restrictions on their reproductive capacity.
1226560	1229040	The reason that's a problem is because so many women
1229920	1232720	end up in that situation despite wanting children.
1232720	1234480	So that's a real psychological problem.
1234480	1237280	But you could take a sociological stance and say,
1237280	1243120	well, as has been insisted upon for 60 years,
1243120	1244640	there's too many people on the planet,
1244640	1246560	and it's just not a bad thing at all
1246560	1248480	if we stop reproducing in this manner.
1248480	1251920	And if the price we have to pay for reduction
1251920	1254560	in the number of excess mouths to feed
1254560	1256800	is that there are some unhappy women, so be it.
1257360	1258720	What do you think about this
1258720	1261280	at a sociological or political or economic level?
1261920	1264800	Well, first of all, I think that's a terribly sad thing
1264800	1269920	to contemplate that we have to somehow enforce
1271120	1275840	perhaps lifelong grief and sadness on a subset of society
1275840	1279360	who were mostly unlucky enough not to have the children
1279360	1284400	they wanted to have for the sake of the planet when there are...
1284880	1285840	Hypothetical, say.
1285840	1289440	Hypothetical planet at some future time.
1289440	1290560	At some future time.
1291280	1294800	And to me, the first thing, my reaction,
1294800	1297680	strong reaction, isn't there another way, if that's right?
1298240	1302480	And then you look at data as a reported nature last year
1302480	1305520	on the overall footprint by age group.
1306800	1308880	Quite a number of scientists put their name to it,
1308880	1313200	and it states very clearly that 8% of our footprint
1314080	1316560	occurs when we're aged under 30.
1317760	1321360	Then it rises quite significantly between 30 and around 65,
1321360	1323120	I believe, and then it falls off sharply.
1324480	1329840	Well, that means that if the world's births were to...
1329840	1331600	Magically, well, it wouldn't be magic,
1331600	1332720	dropped by, say, half.
1332720	1334400	I love taking extreme situations.
1334400	1336560	So let's imagine that from tomorrow,
1336640	1339440	only half of the births happen for some crazy reason,
1340240	1344400	that 8% of total emissions or footprint would go down to 4%
1344960	1346000	in 30 years' time.
1347040	1350880	This is going to have almost no impact for decades.
1351520	1354480	At a time when I think we have to find other solutions
1354480	1357760	as much as they're needed to solve problems that are out there.
1357760	1360320	So the idea that we're going to inflict this pain,
1361040	1363920	deep personal suffering pain in people,
1363920	1367840	and perhaps be pleased about it, as I know some people are,
1369440	1371680	I think it's terribly said.
1371680	1374320	I think it might be that, to come back,
1374320	1376320	I would like to clarify that for those people
1376320	1381040	who don't have the desire, I consider myself a pan-natalist.
1382000	1383280	If you don't want to have children,
1383280	1385440	I will be your biggest supporter to say that's fine.
1386480	1388960	And I think there might be a misunderstanding in society
1388960	1391840	for some people who perhaps don't share that desire,
1391840	1396080	who perhaps can't quite understand how fundamental this desire is.
1396720	1398400	Yeah, well, most people who are in that boat
1398400	1401760	are being willfully blind in my experience.
1401760	1406960	And so the idea that there are reasons to not want to have children,
1406960	1411360	one reason is an overwhelming self-centered narcissism.
1411360	1414800	That's not the only reason, but it's definitely one reason.
1414800	1417040	And people talk about, you know,
1417040	1419040	the interference with their personal freedom
1419040	1420720	and their desire to pursue their career.
1420720	1424080	And in that, I read something like the absolute inability
1424080	1426720	to ever sacrifice your own narrow self-interest.
1426720	1431200	And I do mean narrow to the, what would you say,
1431200	1433040	concerns and needs of other people.
1433040	1436560	So, you know, it's interesting to me that it's 5%
1437520	1438880	that don't want children,
1438880	1442800	and that the rate of that kind of self-centered narcissism
1442800	1444400	is about 4-5% too.
1444400	1447040	Now, I am not saying that everyone who decides
1447040	1449520	not to have children falls into that category,
1449520	1452080	but I am saying that a fair number of people
1452080	1454720	who don't want children fall into that category.
1454720	1457600	I mean, if you think about it biologically,
1457600	1460320	every single one of your maternal ancestors
1460320	1463440	for 3.5 billion years reproduced successfully.
1463440	1466080	And it might be that you're the exception to that rule.
1466080	1467520	But, you know, if you are,
1467520	1469600	you should think long and hard about why.
1469600	1472800	You also might want to think long and hard about why,
1472800	1476080	given that it's likely to have a pretty damn detrimental effect
1476080	1477200	on your life.
1477200	1480080	You know, it's all fine to be fancy free and footloose
1480080	1481600	when you're 30 and 35,
1481600	1483920	but it's a lot less amusing when you're 50,
1483920	1486640	and it might be downright dreadful by the time you're,
1486640	1487840	let's say 65.
1488640	1490320	So, all right.
1490320	1493760	So, on the population front now,
1493760	1496480	we talked a little bit about the psychological catastrophe
1496480	1498160	of involuntary childlessness.
1498720	1503200	I'm curious too about the social and economic consequences.
1503200	1505600	So, as you get a demographic bulge,
1505600	1508400	more and more older people and fewer and fewer younger people,
1508400	1512640	obviously, you have fewer people to take care of the older people,
1512640	1517200	but I also have never really read anything pertaining to models
1517200	1520560	of like real estate value collapse,
1520560	1524640	because it doesn't take very long if there are more houses
1524640	1529200	than there are people for the value of real estate to fall to,
1529200	1530400	well, to what?
1530400	1531440	To nothing?
1531440	1533440	I mean, that's what happened in Detroit.
1533440	1535360	It basically fell to nothing.
1535360	1537360	I mean, Detroit has recovered to some degree,
1537360	1540320	but we don't know at all what the world would look like
1540320	1544000	if real estate values fell to virtually nothing,
1544000	1548640	especially because that's where most people put their retirement value.
1548640	1551760	So, what do you see, what do you foresee happening
1551760	1554480	on the political and economic front,
1555360	1560720	given the shift towards the elderly demographically?
1560720	1563040	We're going to see it in China first, right, clearly.
1563760	1564720	Clearly.
1564720	1566480	Well, Japan too.
1566480	1568560	One of the reasons I moved to live in Japan
1568560	1570400	is to be close to...
1570400	1571840	I wanted to feel this product.
1571840	1574240	I wanted to be able to see it and almost touch it,
1574240	1575520	and you can there.
1575520	1577040	But you mentioned Detroit.
1577040	1580400	I spent many, many years living in the suburbs of Detroit,
1580960	1584320	and right around the time I was looking to start this project,
1586480	1588720	I was able to drive around the streets of Detroit
1588720	1593360	and see street after street after street of tens and tens of thousands
1593360	1595920	of decaying houses.
1596880	1600080	I remember one day driving along and there was a house,
1600640	1605120	and these were nice houses back in the day, still spacious,
1605920	1609360	and there was a young family having a picnic outside one of these houses.
1610480	1612400	And it was the perfect setting, you might say,
1612400	1616400	and every context except every other house in the street
1616400	1620160	looked like they were completely vacant, dilapidated.
1620640	1625840	And around that time, listening to local Detroit news every night,
1625840	1626960	it was crime.
1626960	1629280	It was street lights that weren't functioning.
1629280	1630400	It was lack of safety.
1630400	1632560	It was lack of functioning of basic utilities.
1632560	1635680	It was infrastructure and bridges that the city couldn't afford.
1635680	1638080	And of course, in 2013, it went bankrupt.
1638080	1641600	So I had this backdrop to knowing what was happening
1641600	1643840	to Detroit as a city,
1643840	1645200	and you're running by property value.
1645200	1647680	Around that time, you could buy a significant property in Detroit
1647680	1648960	for $10,000.
1648960	1650640	You probably couldn't go there to ever see it,
1650640	1652160	because it wasn't safe at that time.
1652160	1652880	Right, right, right.
1652880	1654400	And you were right, Detroit has come back.
1654400	1655520	So in some ways, it is a challenge.
1655520	1657920	Well, they demolished huge tracts of houses.
1657920	1661600	But how do you do that when half the houses are still occupied?
1661600	1663680	You go through this period of time,
1663680	1665520	unless you're going to say to people,
1665520	1667680	everybody move three streets over now,
1667680	1669200	and you do that every few years,
1670000	1672960	you can't easily go into neighborhoods
1672960	1675680	and start moving things back to nature,
1675680	1676880	which is what Detroit's doing.
1677440	1679440	You can individual houses,
1679440	1681360	but you still have these scars
1681360	1683360	of the empty spaces that were there.
1683360	1685760	And I show some of this in the documentary.
1685760	1688080	So the idea, I mean, people,
1690160	1692240	I was on a podcast with Williamson recently,
1692240	1695920	and it was the first time I got a sense
1695920	1697280	of the comments that people make.
1697280	1701120	And many people were sharing these deep personal stories
1701120	1703280	about their life to do with unplanned chalices.
1704000	1705120	Yeah.
1705120	1707360	Others were sharing concerns about
1707360	1709120	whether they ever become grandparents.
1709120	1712960	And so, but a lot of people were saying,
1714480	1716640	well, this is just about economics.
1716640	1717360	You know, who cares?
1717360	1719280	This is just about big corporations suffering.
1719280	1719840	Who cares?
1720560	1721920	I think people need to understand
1721920	1724640	this is going to impact everybody, everybody's life.
1724640	1727280	If you're living in an area where there's literally
1727280	1729680	decay, dilapidation all around you
1729680	1731920	and the taxes that you're paying to your city
1731920	1734080	or your municipality aren't covering
1734080	1735440	the basic infrastructure,
1736160	1737680	no one's going to escape from this.
1737680	1739120	And I think people don't understand that.
1739120	1744160	So in my case, understanding life in Detroit,
1744160	1746800	I think, I really love the city and it's great.
1746800	1747920	You know, I love the people.
1749280	1751280	I love the way it is starting to come back.
1752160	1756400	But that experience, I think, really spoke to me
1756400	1759280	that we really need to think about what this means.
1759280	1760880	And you talk about the socioeconomic.
1760880	1763440	I mean, the economics, you know, go beyond the city
1763440	1764320	and the property values.
1764320	1766400	It's the pension funds.
1766400	1770000	It's the social welfare funds that, you know, people think,
1770000	1774160	I think I did too at the time that, you know, the retirement,
1774160	1778080	the cost to maintain each of us in a retirement
1778080	1780880	is basically what the government or someone's been saving
1780880	1782080	for when we get to that age.
1782080	1782640	Yeah, right.
1782640	1784880	It's not what we're paying right now.
1784880	1786160	That's a bargain with the future.
1786160	1787280	That's a bargain.
1787280	1789520	You're covering the people who are retired now.
1789520	1791760	What the government has put away for us is debt.
1792400	1792720	Debt.
1792720	1793040	Yeah, yeah.
1793040	1794080	There's no savings.
1794640	1796240	And then there's a promise.
1796240	1796800	Right.
1796800	1798560	And then the debt's a problem because...
1798560	1799680	Yes, that's for sure.
1799680	1802000	If you have a shrinking number of taxpayers,
1802000	1803520	the debt's not shrinking.
1803520	1808320	So the repayment on the debt actually becomes worse and worse and worse.
1808320	1808560	Yeah.
1808560	1811680	Well, and hypothetically, you can remediate that with immigration,
1811680	1814320	but then that opens up another can of worms,
1814320	1820320	which is no one really knows what the maximal rate of incorporation
1820320	1824320	a society can manage without imploding, right?
1824320	1827760	I mean, obviously, Canada, the US, the US in particular,
1827760	1828960	is an immigrant society,
1828960	1832000	and that's worked out extremely well for the immigrants
1832000	1833600	and for the society.
1833600	1837680	But the idea that there's no upper limit to our capacity
1837680	1842080	to digest and integrate, let's say, is absolutely preposterous.
1842080	1847520	So, and we don't know, but the notion that we can replenish at the rate
1847520	1851120	that we're losing on the birth rate front strikes me as,
1851120	1852800	it's at least a debatable claim.
1855760	1856800	We'll be right back.
1856800	1860560	First, we wanted to give you a sneak peek at Jordan's new series, Exodus.
1866320	1869280	The Hebrews created history as we know it.
1870000	1871600	You don't get away with anything,
1871600	1874160	and so you might think you can bend the fabric of reality
1874160	1876000	and that you can treat people instrumentally
1876000	1879680	and that you can bow to the tyrant and violate your conscience without cost.
1879680	1881040	You will pay the piper.
1881040	1884240	It's going to call you out of that slavery into freedom,
1884240	1886240	even if that pulls you into the desert.
1889840	1892800	And we're going to see that there's something else going on here
1892800	1896800	that is far more cosmic and deeper than what you can imagine.
1896880	1901920	The highest ethical spirit to which we're beholden
1901920	1906560	is presented precisely as that spirit that allies itself
1906560	1909520	with the cause of freedom against tyranny.
1909520	1912320	Yes, exactly. I want villains to get punished.
1912320	1913920	But do you want the villains to learn
1913920	1915760	before they have to pay the ultimate price?
1915760	1917360	That's such a Christian question.
1927440	1936880	Immigration is a subject that I think we actually only look at one side of it,
1936880	1939920	and I certainly did, until I went to Nepal.
1939920	1944640	And I sat down with the professor of the head of the department of population,
1944640	1948080	Professor Patak, in one of the largest universities in Asia.
1948720	1952080	And I wanted to talk about falling birth rates in Nepal,
1952080	1954240	which were just about replacement level at that time.
1955040	1961200	And all he seemed to want to talk about was the pains of migration on Nepal,
1961200	1963920	the people, the communities that are left behind.
1964800	1969200	I never for one second had thought about this dark side of immigration.
1969200	1971920	Oh, your brain drain, for example.
1971920	1973840	Community drain. You're actually taking away,
1973840	1975840	you're leaving the old parents there,
1975840	1978080	and you're sending remittances back.
1978080	1979280	And that seems positive.
1979920	1982480	But those parents aren't really looking for remittances,
1982480	1988000	they're looking for people, community, their children to be there into their older age.
1988880	1991680	And we went to film some of these older people,
1991680	1994960	and the looks on their forelorn looks in their face.
1994960	1996560	No one thinks about that.
1996560	1998400	And then you have another situation,
1998400	2001840	which is often it's men who are the immigrants, at least first.
2003040	2009440	And, well, okay, so maybe that seems to sound a good way for it to start.
2010160	2016160	But there's another dark side to that, is the women behind are either not married yet,
2016160	2019440	or they are married, and there are men have gone off elsewhere,
2020080	2021200	and they're not having children.
2022560	2025280	Or their husband's coming back for three weeks a year,
2025920	2028800	and you've got three weeks a year to try and get pregnant.
2029680	2030880	And of course, most are not.
2031680	2036400	So you actually are propelling countries into low birth rates,
2036640	2040160	the same factor that the rest of us are going through right now.
2040880	2044400	So the immigration debate, and I'm an immigrant myself,
2044400	2048400	you know, I've been an immigrant to the US, to Japan now.
2049840	2052880	So I'm not sleeping all against immigration at all, as you say,
2052880	2056560	it's done great service to US, Canada, and many other countries too.
2058320	2059520	But the idea that-
2059520	2062880	But yeah, but that doesn't mean it's a solution to the violation of the play and replacement.
2062880	2064240	Right, right, right.
2064240	2067280	Now you talked about Japan, let's talk about Japan a little bit.
2067280	2068640	How long did you live in Japan?
2068640	2070880	I still do, so I've been there for five years.
2071840	2076160	And you said you can, well, so what do you experience there in relationship
2076160	2078480	to your concerns about population decline?
2079120	2084000	Let me tell you about a community in rural Tokyo.
2084000	2087280	So this is the world's biggest city based on some measures.
2088160	2092240	You go to the northwestern part of Tokyo,
2092240	2095840	and there's an area called Takashi Medaera that's featured in the documentary.
2096880	2102080	1973, the 10,000 homes in this apartment were filled with young families.
2102880	2106480	And there's all footies where you see, you know, just children everywhere.
2106480	2109040	I went back with someone who was a child in those days,
2109840	2113520	and, you know, you can hear the voices of the past.
2114080	2119360	And today, it's a ghost town, but it's not unoccupied.
2119840	2123200	Ninety-eight percent of the apartments are still occupied,
2123200	2127360	but they're old people, and they're mostly old women living alone.
2127360	2129520	Yes, and they're old women because men die early.
2129520	2130160	Men die early.
2130160	2132240	Right, so this is another, that's exactly right.
2132240	2137120	So one of the things that you see as young people disappear,
2137760	2143600	and as the population ages, is that the landscape is made up of isolated old women
2144560	2147520	who no one cares about, right?
2147520	2151600	A dismal destiny for all concerned.
2152720	2156720	You know, I'd love people, frankly, to watch the documentary to really sense this,
2156720	2163920	because, you know, there's one scene there, and it is harrowing, but to put it in simple terms,
2163920	2169920	there's an 80-year-old woman who has no family, who's contemplating suicide,
2170000	2175120	because she's nothing to live for, no one to live for, and no one to communicate.
2175120	2176400	Oh, she should move to Canada.
2176400	2180800	We have a nice medically assisted death program here that's, I think,
2180800	2183680	accounting for something like three to five percent of all deaths now.
2183680	2187600	So, you know, there's a solution for everyone to contemplate.
2189120	2192160	In fact, there was a Japanese professor who came out the other day,
2192160	2197040	a week ago, suggesting that it would be morally appropriate for the older people
2197040	2202400	in Japan to consider suicide as a root out, because they're a burden to society.
2203360	2207200	And now he's backtracking, saying he didn't really mean that, but it's dangerous
2207200	2210480	once you start to put that out there, because there are people.
2211040	2217920	You know, I remember a conversation with a young woman in Japan, and talking about her future,
2217920	2222880	and I did that with a lot of people, over 230 people I interviewed in 24 countries,
2223600	2228160	and she mentioned that her grandmother was living with her family,
2228960	2232320	but she mentioned the burden of her grandmother to the family.
2233360	2238160	And she came out with a point that I guess many might be thinking when you're that age,
2238160	2239280	why is she still here?
2240560	2247600	And when you hear that, you know, and then you meet people who are that age,
2247600	2251600	who I think are still so much to give to society, they're just excluded from it.
2251600	2252480	They're not.
2252480	2254800	Well, it's hard if they're not integrated in...
2254800	2257440	Well, sometimes it's hard if they are integrated into a family,
2257440	2259200	but it's definitely harder if they're not.
2259200	2262960	It's also the case that a lot of people who contemplate suicide
2263920	2267680	do that not so much because they're specifically suffering,
2267680	2269840	although that can certainly be a contributing factor,
2269840	2275520	but because they do believe that they are fundamentally best construed as a burden,
2275520	2279760	and that the world, including the people around them, would be better off if they disappeared.
2280560	2288000	So that's a very sad, what would you say, realm to inhabit in your misery and isolation.
2288000	2292320	So can we walk through the structure of the documentary?
2292320	2292880	Yes, of course.
2292880	2297040	Yeah, so it's just so everyone listening is reminded it's called
2297040	2299040	the name of the documentary is Birth Gap.
2299600	2301680	And so let's walk through the structure of it.
2302800	2305280	The first of all, the title, Birth Gap.
2305280	2307920	I'm going to just explain why it's called Birth Gap.
2307920	2308960	What is a birth gap?
2309760	2313040	To me, it's what I defined as the gap between the number of old people
2313040	2315120	to support in society and births.
2315840	2321520	So it's an indication of, frankly, a measure that we're not taking account of today.
2321520	2322720	What is that ratio?
2323680	2333680	So to me, to be very honest with you, whether we hit 9 billion or maybe 10, it's trivial.
2333680	2334480	It's going to happen.
2334480	2336800	It's going to be in that ballpark.
2336800	2339040	Whether we like it or not, that's going to happen.
2340160	2343920	And what actually matters is the age structure.
2343920	2346800	So Birth Gap, the title of the movie, that's where it comes from.
2347840	2354640	Before I went on this journey, chapter one is me literally going with an iPad,
2354640	2355840	showing people data.
2356720	2360720	We started in Italy, we were Switzerland, we went to Japan and just started
2360720	2364560	talk to people about what's happening in their own societies.
2364560	2367920	So how did you move into the realm of documentary filmmaking?
2368560	2372560	Well, I have to thank my second son, Adam, for that.
2372560	2376240	Because my idea at this point, I mean, I'm not a filmmaker.
2377040	2378080	Certainly wasn't then.
2379200	2382560	My thought was, this is a big problem.
2382560	2383920	I can write a book about this.
2383920	2387520	I thought just about I have the ability to write, to explain this.
2388320	2390880	And what I wanted to do, because there's other books out there,
2390880	2394560	was come up with a new way to help visualize this problem
2395120	2397440	and to use the book to kind of communicate.
2397440	2400640	And I felt, well, maps, no one's really come up with the structure of a map.
2401680	2409120	And in doing this, I was explained to my son, Adam, and he said, Dad, no one, our age,
2409120	2412320	his age, reads books anymore, we all watch documentaries.
2412320	2413440	Right, right.
2413440	2414560	Or listen to them.
2414560	2415520	Or listen to them.
2415520	2416240	Yeah.
2416240	2418400	And for me, well, that's not me.
2418400	2420320	There's no way I could possibly do that.
2420320	2425840	And then by chance, a friend of a friend was a former videographer news anchor
2425840	2432000	for a Washington DC news network, but was going out on her own.
2432560	2436320	And long story short, we thought, well, OK, let's see if we can make this work.
2436880	2440560	And I brought her along for two weeks to film the first interviews,
2440560	2444160	thinking if nothing else, this is going to be an archive for my own research.
2444160	2444880	Right, right, right.
2446880	2449520	Save me note-taking while I'm listening to all of these people.
2449520	2456240	And as we got into it, the personal stories opened up of people who you could see them
2456240	2461840	contemplating the future of their lives like one springs to mind a young elementary school
2461840	2465200	teacher in Switzerland, 30 years old, a young man.
2465840	2471520	And when we walked through with him the future of elementary schools in Switzerland,
2472160	2477040	you could see the process in his mind, realizing we're not going to need anywhere
2477040	2481760	near the number of elementary school teachers that we have now and what that might mean for him.
2483440	2488480	So the documentary starts literally with me asking people in countries, why is this happening?
2489360	2499200	And frankly, I was hoping, in this entire project, I was expecting at some point to
2499200	2504960	sit down and do some form of regressive model to find a correlation between something that would link
2505920	2512960	these small dragons, these falling birth rates in Japan, Germany, and Italy,
2512960	2515360	because they were happening at the same time and they were spreading.
2516480	2518560	I never got to that point and I'm very grateful.
2518560	2523840	I didn't because I probably would have found something like ice cream sales happened at the
2523840	2526560	same time and now some curious thing would have come up.
2526560	2528480	It's very hard to identify.
2529280	2535280	Well, it seems obvious that one of the causes, the distal causes, I would say,
2535280	2539600	clearly is the promotion of the birth control pill.
2539600	2547360	But even that is a somewhat shallow answer because there's a very specific set of social
2547360	2555280	and economic realities, zeitgeist, that even made the invention and distribution and acceptance
2555280	2557440	of the birth control possible.
2557440	2563760	You had to have the psychological stage set for the acceptance of that technology,
2563760	2567040	the demand for that technology before it could be developed or implemented.
2570800	2571840	You started the documentary.
2571840	2572800	You're in chapter one.
2572800	2574960	You're starting to ask people what's going on.
2574960	2576000	What are they telling you?
2576720	2580480	Yeah, well, no one had a clear answer and maybe that was overly simplistic.
2580480	2584240	But what I was trying to do is find some common thread.
2585200	2592000	But let me just, if I can, talk about contraceptives because there's a wonderful kind of example.
2592960	2602080	The contraceptive pill was not legalized in Japan until 1990 and it was only legalized
2602080	2604560	because Viagra was legalized.
2604560	2608880	And at that point, women said, wait, you've been blocking the contraceptive pill and now
2608880	2610560	you're allowing Viagra at that point.
2610560	2614640	So you had the precipitous decline in birth rate from 1973.
2614640	2617760	You had an increase in mass abortions.
2618560	2621520	So this was a societal issue with that.
2621520	2624000	So okay, so that shows that it's something deeper than this.
2624000	2625520	It's something deeper.
2625520	2631200	And also, if you look at other countries, particularly UK at the time, France to US,
2631200	2635440	where you also had access to the contraceptive pill, you were not seeing falling birth rates.
2636000	2641120	And a lot of people would say, well, it's obvious it was industrialization.
2641120	2645360	It was something to do with urbanization.
2645360	2647120	But the correlations aren't there.
2647120	2651040	If you look at, well, why did this only happen in those three countries?
2651040	2654880	And the answer comes back to, I'd love people to see unfold in the documentary,
2654880	2662480	but it's a sudden increase in this unplanned involuntary childlessness happened in Germany,
2662480	2664320	Italy, those countries at the same time.
2664320	2669280	Well, it's definitely the case that as women become more educated, they have fewer children.
2670160	2677840	And that's now the precise causal pathway there isn't obvious.
2677840	2685360	One simple suggestion would be that it is a matter of accidental delay.
2685360	2689520	I mean, I've seen this in my daughter, you know, my daughter, although she had terrible
2689520	2691680	health problems and that complicated her life a lot.
2692240	2698240	She had initially thought that she might want to go be a physician, but that's like 12 years.
2698240	2702080	And she was also very oriented towards having children.
2703200	2706880	And she's managed to have one child despite her health problems.
2706880	2714080	But that desire to pursue an intense educational pathway does exist in conflict,
2714080	2718240	certainly with an early start to family development.
2719200	2722480	If you presume that that doesn't matter because you've got time,
2722480	2726320	you're not going to find out that isn't true for 10 years in your own life.
2726320	2729520	And maybe the culture won't find out that's true for like 30 years.
2729520	2733120	You know, I mean, we still tell young women who are 19.
2734000	2739200	I made a comment on that was clipped on an Instagram reel by someone
2740000	2744000	about the fact that we always lie to young women about what's going to be important in their lives.
2744000	2746160	We tell them it's going to be all career.
2746160	2750800	Said, you know, I've worked in female dominated industries my whole life.
2750800	2757520	And what I've observed is among men and women alike that it's a very rare person for whom
2757520	2760160	career is the most important thing in their life.
2760160	2763920	Even if they're men, although it's true for more men,
2763920	2767440	it's true for virtually no women by the time they hit 30.
2767440	2771680	And the amount of vitriol that comment generated was unparalleled.
2771680	2776000	And that's something because I've had plenty of vitriol generated from things I said,
2776000	2781360	but that was and it was all young women, you know, talking about how some old white guy like me
2781360	2786080	had no right to tell young women what to do with their bodies, which I most certainly was not.
2786720	2792400	But but it is, you can see a simple pathway there, right?
2792400	2797600	It's like, well, we have this avenue where we can pursue our career and our education
2797600	2802400	and everything else we want. And then we'll be able to solve the problem of having a family.
2802400	2808800	The problem with that is, well, it's hard enough to find a mate when you're 23, 24.
2808800	2810880	By the time you're 30, it's even more difficult.
2810880	2814880	And by the time you're 35, it's starting to become well now impossible to find a mate
2814880	2818880	and get pregnant and have a family, especially if you're going to have more than one kid.
2818880	2824480	And so well, so there's a there's a direct conflict there between
2825440	2833440	the avenues that are open to women and the need to to strike while the iron's hot on the reproductive front.
2833440	2835440	Nobody really knows how to reconcile that.
2835440	2839440	I mean, it's odd because women will live about seven years longer than men.
2839440	2845440	So it could be the case that the societal norm could be that women have their children
2845440	2849440	when they're quite young and then go back to school in their 30s, that would actually work out.
2849440	2853440	In principle, that could work out quite nicely, but we don't have the norms in place
2853760	2855200	to make that a possibility.
2855200	2857440	But we have to start addressing exactly this.
2857440	2865920	Because if we don't, you know, to me, I mean, there's so many ideas today about reproductive technology
2865920	2867600	that are overstated.
2867600	2869440	Oh, yes, terribly.
2869440	2870240	Freeze your eggs.
2870240	2875520	And yeah, it's 40, you know, if you have a partner and if you still have energy that you might then.
2875520	2875840	Yes.
2875840	2877040	And everything goes well.
2877040	2877280	Yeah.
2877280	2878640	If everything goes well, you have the money.
2878640	2878880	Yeah.
2878880	2880960	And you and the emotional stamina, all of that.
2881600	2888240	So part of what I am hoping to do through the documentary and my work after this
2888240	2893040	is to just increase awareness, particularly to women, but you need a man as well.
2893040	2900720	So it's both that the fertility window is much shorter and the ability of children gets harder
2900720	2901440	and harder and harder.
2901440	2903040	It's not just about getting pregnant.
2903040	2907040	It's about being able to deliver, you know, being able to see the pregnancy through to,
2907920	2910560	which gets exponentially harder very, very quickly.
2911040	2915280	I should mention, I interviewed five fertility doctors for the documentary itself.
2916400	2922240	And, you know, each one of them wanted to open up about the challenges because normally
2922240	2923840	they have to sell their services.
2923840	2929200	Normally I have to tell people, think positively, here's what we've done for other people.
2929200	2931040	Here's what we can do for you.
2931040	2936000	What they were telling to me openly, I'm frankly getting quite emotional about it on a couple
2936000	2941040	of applications, was it's terrible because so often it doesn't work out.
2941040	2947520	Well, one in three couples by the age of 30 have pronounced fertility problems defined as
2947520	2953600	inability to conceive within a year of embarking on the endeavor consciously, right?
2953600	2954720	So that's one in three.
2954720	2959280	And of course it just gets worse and worse as age creeps up.
2959280	2960800	And 30 is not that old.
2960800	2963040	And it does mean that women have a damn tight window.
2964000	2970560	It's 13 years, let's say, by the time you're 17, by some standards you're mature enough to
2970560	2976480	consider reproduction, 17 or 18, on the extreme end.
2976480	2982000	And then, well, 35 is the other end of that distribution.
2982000	2988080	And you're playing with fire by the time you're delaying, especially if you don't have a partner,
2988080	2991760	by the time you're delaying till 35, especially if you want three children.
2992320	2993120	Yeah, right.
2993120	2994080	I'm thinking just one.
2995280	3000160	And it's also the case, I think if you're a reasonable observer of human nature,
3000160	3005520	you see that people have three sources of fundamental gratification in their lives.
3006080	3011120	One is the pursuit of their own interests, including career and job.
3011920	3013760	One is their intimate relationship.
3013760	3014960	And the other is their family.
3014960	3020320	And obviously the intimate relationship and the family are very integrally associated.
3020320	3027840	And if you miss out on one of those, you may be able to fill it by exceptional ability
3028720	3030000	in the remaining domains.
3030000	3034800	But for most people, not only is that highly unlikely, it's also highly undesirable.
3037760	3043920	Because to take the point as well, here in my eye, an older male talking about things
3043920	3049200	that are very sensitive to women, but there are a lot of women out there saying the exact same
3049440	3053840	thing. And there was one this morning, I got an email from Melanie Knokin,
3053840	3058080	who's written a book called Otherhood, who herself has no children.
3058080	3063600	And she put it succinctly that in her words, women are going through the education path,
3063600	3067360	the career path, to try to ultimately fall in love and have a family.
3067360	3068240	Yeah, right.
3068240	3069360	It's all linked.
3069360	3070800	Yeah, well, I think it's the same for men.
3071360	3072080	I think so too.
3072080	3076480	Well, half the reason, half, it's more than that, half the reason that
3076480	3080240	men strive for career success is to impress women and attract them.
3080240	3081440	In fact, it's higher than that.
3083040	3087120	But maybe that point is the heart of the problem we have today, because today,
3087120	3091360	if you look at who's at college and who's actually earning more right now,
3091360	3095440	I read this morning, women in cities in the U.S. are earning more than men.
3095440	3098080	I don't know if that's right or wrong, but you have this situation.
3098080	3099520	Yeah, it's right under 30.
3099520	3100080	Yeah.
3100080	3104800	So in U.S. colleges right now, I believe it's 9.5 million women.
3104880	3107280	And Iran, 6.57 million men.
3107280	3111760	Oh, and the women start dropping out of college, by the way, when they start
3111760	3114000	to outnumber the men two to one, right?
3114000	3117200	Because a lot of the reason people go to college, you gotta ask yourself,
3117200	3118400	what's college for?
3118400	3121600	It's like, well, it's to get educated, to go to lectures, to be accredited.
3121600	3123520	It's like, no, probably not.
3124080	3127040	Probably the reason people go to college is to find a bait.
3127040	3130880	And there's a selected pool there, and you have a decent chance of finding
3130880	3137680	someone of approximately your ability and forward-looking vision, let's say.
3137680	3143200	And the reason people are willing to shell out between $150,000 and $250,000 for four years
3143200	3146080	is in no small part, so that they can find a mate.
3146080	3151280	Well, and if you demolish that by, well, radically decreasing the number of available men,
3151280	3153760	for example, you're just going to blow the whole enterprise out of the water,
3153760	3155120	which is already what's happening.
3155600	3157440	And absolutely.
3158240	3163280	And this is perhaps my greatest concern, because I think if we make young people
3163280	3168560	more aware of fertility, the fertility window, they might want to have children earlier.
3168560	3171680	If we link that to in some way enabling careers later in life,
3172240	3177760	which has to fundamentally happen for this to work, we might still be left with a situation
3177760	3184320	where women, the term is hypergenic, where women want to marry someone at least as educated,
3184320	3187280	at least as successful, taller than they are.
3187280	3191520	But if we're in a situation where there's so few men getting the same level of education,
3191520	3193600	we might be left with this imbalance.
3193600	3196160	Oh, yeah, that's already happening, clearly.
3196160	3200480	It's very difficult for women to overcome the hypergamous instinct,
3200480	3204640	because they're trying to redress the imbalance in terms of reproductive responsibility.
3204640	3206000	There's no evidence at all.
3206000	3211600	You get a little bit of flattening of hypergamy in extremely egalitarian societies like Scandinavia,
3211600	3213440	but it certainly doesn't disappear.
3214000	3218160	And so that's built in at a very fundamental biological level.
3218160	3222160	And I don't think any casual tinkering on the anthropological or sociological front
3222160	3223200	is going to shift that a bit.
3223840	3225600	So that's a big problem.
3225600	3226320	It's a big problem.
3226320	3234320	It's also the case too that if marriages where the wife out earns or out statuses the husband
3234320	3237840	tend to be comparatively unstable and violent.
3237840	3243600	So now you can lay that at the feet of the men if you're inclined to, but in some sense
3243600	3246560	it doesn't really matter, because that's the way it is.
3246560	3252880	And so the women are unhappy and the men are threatened, and that's just not a good recipe
3252880	3254480	for marital stability.
3255440	3257120	Everyone loses in this situation.
3257120	3260560	And so let's talk about another country, Thailand.
3260560	3265520	So you would think if you'd asked me how many women are in college in Thailand,
3265520	3267200	I might have said 15%.
3267200	3268640	I have no idea, but no.
3268640	3269840	It's 55%.
3271280	3273360	40% of men are in college in Thailand.
3273360	3275600	So you have a similar shift even there.
3275600	3279920	And what's happening to the men, the documentary, we went to a temple
3279920	3284000	where monks are trying to rehabilitate young men who fell out of college
3284000	3285920	or didn't go to college moreover.
3285920	3291280	What they did, age 16, 18, was turn to alcohol, was turn to substances.
3292160	3295840	To drive taxis because they could get some cash, because there was no point trying to
3295840	3296800	compete with the women.
3297840	3299920	So you have these deep societal problems.
3299920	3303280	But yet they want to be really clear that the answer to this is not
3305360	3308400	in some way preventing women from getting an education.
3308400	3310400	That's just not going to function.
3310400	3311360	How are you going to do that?
3312400	3314960	You also lose access to half the world's brain power.
3314960	3316320	Of course, of course.
3317040	3321840	There are people who think that and there are people who I think want to use this conversation
3321840	3325520	to promote that, because I've seen comments along those lines
3325520	3326080	too often.
3326640	3333040	This has to be, therefore, partly about men in some way, asking why are men
3333040	3334160	excluded from society?
3334160	3339440	Why are they becoming incels, or in Japan they call it otaku, the young man who stays home
3339440	3341040	playing his gaming systems.
3342800	3344720	I don't think that's the right question.
3344720	3347040	I think we almost always ask questions backwards.
3348160	3351040	Why people become useless?
3351040	3352080	That's not a mystery.
3352960	3354880	It's easy to be useless.
3354880	3357840	The mystery is why that doesn't happen to everyone all the time.
3357840	3363840	And the answer is because we build up extremely careful structures of societal discipline
3364480	3370640	to encourage people to adopt mature long-term responsibility and to reward them
3371200	3373120	judiciously for doing so.
3373120	3378000	And when you allow those structures to collapse or work consciously to undermine them,
3378000	3381600	then you get default to the default.
3381600	3383280	And the default is useless.
3383280	3384880	It's short-term gratification.
3385440	3387760	And so you never need an explanation for that.
3387760	3390240	It's like, well, why do people turn to short-term gratification?
3390800	3393600	Because it's gratifying in the short term.
3393600	3394240	It's easy.
3394800	3404080	Now, you know, encouraging men to shed their Peter Pan persona, juvenile Peter Pan persona,
3404080	3410240	and to adopt mature responsibility, that's a real challenge for every society.
3410240	3417120	And we are increasingly not only failing at doing that, but punishing young men for developing,
3418160	3423920	say, the virtues of ambition and, well, an even sexual desire for that matter.
3424800	3426800	So, all right.
3426800	3430160	So chapter one, you went and interviewed a lot of variety of people
3430160	3432880	and just started to flesh out the territory.
3432880	3434320	How does that unfold after that?
3434320	3438400	Well, it comes to the point where I realize,
3438400	3442720	there's a moment I realize there is a connection across all these countries.
3442720	3446880	And it's to do with this structure of the family.
3447520	3450800	You would expect, if you're having fewer children,
3452240	3457280	some of these organizations encourage people to have fewer children, have fewer smaller families,
3457280	3460880	you would expect if they had had any success or people were doing it,
3460880	3463360	you would have a lot of families with only one child.
3464320	3468160	But actually, singletons are actually really quite rare in life.
3468160	3471760	And they're no more common today than they were 30, 40 years ago.
3472880	3475360	So, I started to discover...
3475360	3477840	So, you see people with zero children.
3477840	3479040	Right. That's the only...
3479040	3482000	How do you get a fertility rate of less than replacement levels?
3482000	3484560	See, the number of people having one child are none.
3485360	3489760	So, connecting that allowed me to start to ask more questions about childlessness
3489760	3491280	and about aspirations of life.
3491280	3492080	And that really...
3492080	3494720	I see. So, it's not a matter of small families.
3494720	3494880	No.
3494880	3496240	It's a matter of no family.
3496240	3496640	That's right.
3496640	3499040	And then it's a matter of involuntary, no family.
3499040	3499520	That's right.
3499520	3500400	Okay. Got it.
3500400	3503040	And that's why I didn't end up doing any regressive analysis,
3503040	3505600	because it's a counting problem.
3505600	3507280	You know, we were counting this the wrong way.
3507280	3511360	You just simply need to look at the number of people having one child,
3511360	3513120	two, three, four, and you find this gap,
3513120	3515040	and you find that gap getting wider and wider,
3515040	3521840	and it effectively explains the entire fall below replacement level.
3521840	3524800	But there's really good news here, too.
3524800	3531040	The best news in all of this is that if the majority or significant number
3531040	3535920	of those people who are involuntarily unplanned childlessness, as I call it,
3535920	3538560	if they were having a family, they're not going to have one.
3539440	3542560	They're going to have, in the same proportions, one, two, three, four, five,
3542560	3544640	plus, it's all about having that first child.
3545520	3547040	So, the documentary...
3547040	3548000	Right. Well, the pre...
3548000	3550800	Look, the second child's pretty straightforward after the first.
3550800	3553680	And once you've got two, you're already completely screwed.
3553680	3555360	So, you might as well have three.
3555360	3558880	Well, then the kids start to take care of each other, by the way, too,
3558880	3560880	which is something that parents don't understand,
3560880	3562400	is that, you know, you don't...
3562400	3566080	If you have eight kids, it's not like you're taking care of eight kids.
3566080	3569440	The kids start to form their own society and take care of each other.
3569440	3571680	Yeah, and there's great examples of that in the documentary,
3572240	3574800	or at least the majority of what you saw in Italy,
3574800	3578720	this mother of four children saying she educated her eldest daughter,
3578720	3580960	taught her how to read, and she taught the next daughter.
3580960	3581760	She taught the next one.
3581760	3584160	The next one. So, that's certainly true.
3584160	3588480	But the good news is here, because family structure is really locked in,
3588480	3591840	once, of course, you know, if you go to some countries,
3591840	3594880	as I did in Africa, you've got high birth rates because poverty,
3595680	3598880	somewhat access to reproductive services,
3598880	3600400	but mostly that's covered now.
3600400	3601600	Mostly it is.
3601600	3606080	So, we've got poverty that people in Africa need children to go and get the water.
3606080	3608800	But a lot of good things are being done on that.
3608800	3611040	That poverty level is coming way down.
3611040	3614960	And we're seeing in Africa, on average in sub-Saharan Africa,
3614960	3621200	just to cover that briefly, the average woman is having one less child every 15 years.
3621200	3622560	It's around four now.
3622560	3627120	So, around 30 years time, we're looking at Africa starting to get down towards replacement level.
3627120	3628080	It's on the same path.
3628080	3628880	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3628880	3631680	That's the reasonable assumption based on the data right now.
3631680	3636640	So, once you get to that point, and this is what I think the world of demography really
3637360	3645840	skipped over, is that it's not the same form.
3645840	3649760	It's not like you look at, you know, families going from four to two and then down to 1.5
3649760	3651760	and say, this is the same trend.
3651760	3652640	It's not.
3652640	3656640	When you get to replacement level, when women are having pretty much the family size
3656640	3659760	that they actually want, childlessness kicks in.
3659760	3662640	And it's that that pulls it down a different level.
3662640	3665600	So, the next part of the documentary is then going to people,
3665600	3669360	finding out what their young people, what their aspirations for the future was.
3669360	3675760	Then also talking to men and women who hadn't had children, why they didn't,
3675760	3677440	what it meant to their lives.
3677440	3678560	And that gets quite...
3678560	3680640	What do you find on the aspirational front?
3680640	3685600	And, oh, you know, the majority, the significant majority of people,
3685600	3688720	young people expect or want of children someday.
3688720	3689360	Right, right.
3689360	3693520	Now, I do have some concerns, but no evidence for it, but it's just a natural concern that
3693520	3699600	what we're seeing in the world today, perhaps as over-focused on the environment, is through fear.
3700240	3700560	Yeah.
3700560	3705280	Persuading people more than you would normally expect to not think of children.
3705280	3709520	But I have hope around that because it's this internal desire really doesn't kick in.
3709520	3712400	I think it's not so much fear that's interfering on that front.
3712400	3715920	I think it's actually demoralization, right?
3715920	3722880	Because this is especially true for, let's say, decent young men who would like to be
3723200	3724160	moral actors.
3724160	3729840	If they're told continually which they are, that all of their male pattern behaviors,
3729840	3735760	for example, in school are disruptive, and that their male ambition is nothing but a
3735760	3740320	reflection of the tyrannical patriarchy, and that any interest they might evoke,
3741120	3747120	they might events towards women, is part of the predatory pattern of male behavior,
3747120	3749840	then it demoralizes them.
3749840	3755280	Literally, it makes them feel like their natural proclivity for ambitious striving,
3755280	3760080	let's say, and sexual desire is immoral.
3760080	3766720	And the people you heard the most by doing that are the people who have a moral heart,
3766720	3771120	because the ones who don't care, and the ones who do, I had a friend.
3771840	3779680	His name was Rob Dernan, and he was an early, he fell prey to this anti-male narrative very
3779680	3780640	early in his life.
3780640	3785600	This is like 40 years ago, 50 years ago, and he was definitely guilty about
3786800	3791920	his role as a patriarchal male, let's say, and he did everything he could to adopt a kind of
3791920	3795520	nihilistic Buddhism and just take himself out of life.
3796560	3799920	You know, he thought everything he did was, and everything that men did in general,
3799920	3805120	was just part of the destructive force that was ravaging the world, and he eventually committed
3805120	3806000	suicide.
3806000	3807200	It was awful.
3807200	3809440	I watched that unfold for 50 years.
3810400	3818160	And I would say he had his flaws like everyone does, and in that self-destructive pathway,
3818160	3823040	there can be a fair bit of, let's say, unconscious self-serving.
3823040	3831200	But fundamentally, he was overwhelmed by existential guilt in relationship to being male,
3831200	3834960	and that eventually convinced him to do himself in.
3835680	3843040	It was quite the catastrophic voyage, all things considered, and I know perfectly well
3843040	3847440	that that's not rare, because I've talked to thousands of young men who have been
3847440	3855120	demoralized to the point of suicide, and that story is, I'd say that's the archetypal story.
3855920	3867040	So it's not fear exactly, it's an assault, it's a moral assault, and it's unconscionable.
3867040	3868800	It's an unconscionable moral assault.
3868800	3875520	If your solution to saving the planet is that you have to demoralize young people so badly
3875520	3881440	that they even abstain from sex, then there's seriously something wrong with your worldview.
3882080	3886000	And maybe we could call out Paul Ehrlich on that front, for example.
3886720	3891280	So, all right, so now you're starting to talk to people about their aspirations.
3891280	3896000	You're finding out that young people do want to have a family, and that doesn't mean one child,
3896000	3900400	it means a family, but they're not prioritizing that properly?
3900400	3904880	Or what happens to the people who end up without children?
3904880	3906400	Well, there's no path to it.
3907360	3912080	The path is education, education, education, usually.
3912080	3913440	Not for everyone, but-
3913440	3914080	And then debt?
3914960	3915600	Sure, debt.
3917120	3922080	But that's not the driver, because education in some countries is much lower than the US,
3922080	3924720	so some people will say, oh, debt's the problem.
3924720	3926560	It's not a good thing, it can't help.
3927920	3929600	And that's career, career, career.
3929600	3934720	And no one is guiding people to say, actually, there is a moment in time
3934800	3936640	when you really need to prioritize this.
3938560	3945920	We've left young people to find a path on their own, having sent them off as parents,
3948720	3954560	as societies, to find a path in life that will get them to where they want to be,
3954560	3959040	which everyone, I think, implicitly assumes, for most people, not all,
3959040	3962240	will involve love and will involve children.
3962720	3967200	But actually, what's happening is when young people are getting to that point,
3967760	3975760	they're often in their 30s, because no one really is thinking that 30 is too late at all.
3977120	3983200	But just another statistic, if you look across every country we had data on,
3984400	3989200	the probability of becoming a parent, a mother, rather, it's on women again,
3989200	3995360	the probability of someone without children age 30 ever becoming a parent at most,
3995360	3997440	at most, is 50%.
3998560	3998800	Really?
3998800	3999760	That's just the outcome.
4000800	4002160	So by 30?
4002160	4002960	By 30.
4002960	4007600	If you haven't had your first child by 30, and most countries, it's lower than that.
4008960	4010560	And why is that?
4012000	4014240	There must be multiple causes.
4014240	4016320	Part of that would be partnerlessness.
4016320	4018560	Part of that would be fertility difficulties.
4019680	4021440	What are the major contributors to that?
4021440	4025520	The major contributor is not finding a partner at the right time.
4026480	4029440	Or when you do find a partner, you have challenges.
4030240	4036160	The other thing that is painful to point out to women is that 30-year-old women
4036160	4040480	aren't competing with other 30-year-old women for partners.
4040480	4044720	They're competing with 18 to 35-year-old women for partners.
4044720	4052000	And so all things considered, if you're 30 and you're looking for a mate and you want children,
4052000	4058880	you're putting an awful lot of pressure one way or another on your 30-year-old male target.
4058880	4065200	Because his option is to find a 25-year-old woman who all things being equal
4065920	4069760	is of the same value as you are, except that you're 30.
4069760	4073840	And that means his timeframe is now shortened in a manner that wouldn't be the case
4073840	4075280	if he married someone younger.
4075280	4080720	Plus, women tend to prefer men who are slightly older than them.
4080720	4082000	Well, not exactly slightly.
4082000	4084880	It's actually four years is the average internationally.
4084880	4090560	And so the optimal target for a 25-year-old woman is a 29-year-old man.
4092240	4100480	And it's rude to point such things out, but mate selection is a very difficult problem.
4100480	4105280	And it's also exacerbated by the fact that this is also a terrible thing,
4105280	4108960	is that because of this hypergamous tendency of women, as women,
4108960	4116320	our guy knew a lot of very successful young women who worked in the legal field.
4116320	4122640	And they were often stars in their firms, extremely able people.
4122640	4130240	And generally, they were very vivacious, attractive, intelligent, educated,
4131680	4134000	and intimidating as hell to men.
4135280	4140480	And not that interested in someone who didn't have the same ability and status they did,
4140480	4142000	which was almost no one.
4142000	4143440	So then they're 30.
4143440	4144800	They're extremely choosy.
4144800	4146800	And you could say they have a right to be.
4146800	4151840	But the problem is, well, yeah, you're 30 and you're extremely choosy.
4151840	4156080	And your pool of available candidates has basically shrunk to none,
4156080	4159920	because first of all, a lot of men are already snapped up by the time they're 30.
4159920	4162080	So there's that reduction right off the bat.
4162080	4167360	And then if you're going to reject, women rate 80% of men on dating sites
4167360	4168880	as below average in attractiveness.
4168880	4174880	And that's just the baseline for the women who are high status and high attractive,
4174880	4178160	let's say, very able on the career front.
4178720	4183280	And the men they're going to regard as acceptable,
4183280	4186240	that's a vanishingly small proportion of men.
4186240	4189840	So that's part of the reason why they, what would you say,
4190640	4192800	select themselves out of the mating market.
4192800	4194400	That's brutal, man.
4194400	4194960	It's brutal.
4194960	4197280	And I watched women struggle with that like mad,
4197280	4199680	and certainly had no shortage of sympathy for them.
4199680	4205840	But the mere fact that you're sympathetic to someone
4205840	4208400	doesn't mean that the brute reality that confronts them
4208400	4210240	has been altered in any manner whatsoever.
4210240	4212000	Yeah, a couple of points on that.
4212000	4213680	So I agree with all of that.
4214800	4220480	What I see, and I get to, often once or twice a week,
4220480	4224240	have a coffee with a young person who has reached out.
4224240	4228160	And you know, when you talk about the documentary or friends or friends or friends,
4228160	4230000	someone wants to talk to you about something personal.
4230960	4238240	A common conversation would be women more than men.
4239120	4240720	They've been dating someone for five years.
4240720	4240960	Yeah.
4242000	4245280	They think they might want to, well, different scenarios.
4245280	4247360	They think they might want to settle down and have a child with them,
4247360	4248480	but they've never talked about it.
4249040	4250960	Well, it's only been five years.
4250960	4251280	Right.
4251920	4256640	Or they've already figured out they probably don't want a child with this person.
4256640	4257360	What should they do?
4258320	4263760	Or, worst of all, they've just broken up because they've been dating this guy for seven years,
4263760	4268160	and he's not got another girlfriend who's 25, and she's pregnant.
4269520	4271680	Oh my God, yeah, that's a brutal situation.
4271680	4272160	Brutal?
4272960	4274160	But those are real life stories.
4274160	4276960	Oh, yeah, yeah, that's very, yeah, all that's very common.
4277600	4280720	So the idea of dating someone for an extended period,
4280720	4284480	my children are now, you know, 27 to 20,
4284480	4289200	they're getting to that point where, you know, to me, I'm thinking of my own children
4289200	4293120	when I think of these young people and the advice I would give them.
4293120	4297840	And frankly, the advice I usually give, and I'm not a clinical psychologist,
4297840	4300160	but, you know, people are asking for advice,
4300160	4302800	and I've talked to a lot of people, is if you're unsure,
4303920	4305680	break up, because do you know what?
4305680	4309440	If it feels wrong after you've broken up, you'll get back together quickly.
4310400	4311600	And I'd say more.
4311600	4313760	The other advice, too, is get the hell at it.
4313760	4315760	You think you have a long time to decide.
4315760	4317680	Well, here's a way of thinking about it.
4318480	4324960	If you're reasonably attractive, you'll be able to try out five people.
4325840	4326480	That's it.
4327360	4331280	That's what you've got, you know, because it takes a while to find someone,
4331280	4333440	and then it takes a while to get to know them.
4333440	4336320	And finding them and getting to know them,
4336320	4340320	that's probably something approximating one to two years.
4340400	4342720	And if you do that five times, that's 10 years,
4342720	4344560	and that's your fertility window.
4344560	4349040	And so you think you have time, but that's a delusion,
4349040	4351200	and you think the right person will come around.
4351200	4353200	Well, first of all, that's a delusion to begin with,
4353200	4357680	because you build a relationship, you don't find one.
4357680	4359920	Now, you should have some sense when you pick your partner
4360640	4363200	to the degree that you have the luxury to have some sense,
4363920	4369520	but the notion that the person right for you will come along at the right time,
4370400	4371600	that's just not the case.
4371600	4373200	That isn't how things work at all.
4373200	4376560	And if you know that even if you're very attractive,
4376560	4380640	that the list of true candidates is probably five,
4380640	4384640	and for some people, it's one or zero.
4385440	4390640	And so that's, it's hard, because when you're 17 or 16,
4390640	4393440	especially if you're attractive, and I would say this is especially true
4393440	4395120	if you're an attractive young woman,
4395120	4397680	you have no shortage, generally speaking,
4397680	4399120	of people who are interested in you.
4399600	4402320	And it looks like that's sort of a landscape of plenty,
4402320	4405200	but that doesn't mitigate against the fact
4405200	4407840	that it still takes a long time to get to know people
4407840	4409040	and to find the right person.
4409920	4412000	Now, men have it a bit easier on that front,
4412000	4416880	I would say, because I had one friend who didn't have a child till he was 55.
4418160	4420080	That can always be the case for men,
4420080	4422880	and so the pressure isn't on in the same way.
4422880	4427040	But even with men, I married my wife earlier,
4427040	4428080	we would have had more kids.
4429520	4430400	And that didn't happen.
4431280	4433680	So, and we got married comparatively early
4433680	4437040	for our social class, say, and educational background.
4438320	4439840	Okay, so now you're talking to people
4439840	4441360	and you're finding out they want to have kids,
4441360	4443760	and then they find out that they don't get to, right?
4443760	4444880	A little bit too late.
4444880	4447040	And so where does the documentary go from there?
4447040	4449760	So, from there, we take it into the consequences.
4450640	4454720	The consequences, well, they're partly personal,
4456000	4459040	but partly economic, but everything ultimately is personal,
4459040	4461040	because everything ultimately comes back to,
4461920	4464960	whether it's you and your life and how you live,
4464960	4466400	and whether you're lonely or not,
4467680	4470560	or how much the state can help you,
4470560	4471920	particularly in your later years,
4471920	4473680	through healthcare, through pensions,
4473680	4476160	through your city providing basic services,
4476160	4479280	like water, it all comes back together.
4479280	4482000	So we explore a lot of those, and by the way,
4482000	4484640	I sat down with, I believe, about a dozen experts,
4484720	4489840	many professors, many, you know, a priest, a monk,
4490640	4493200	people involved working with government healthcare programs
4493200	4493920	around the world.
4493920	4499120	So we hear these voices, and other than one organization,
4499120	4503440	which happens to be the successor to what Paul Erlich set up,
4504800	4507520	they were the only organization who took an optimistic view.
4507520	4509280	Of course, they would do that.
4509280	4510800	Everybody else is negative.
4510800	4513840	Everybody else is worried about the future consequences of this.
4515280	4517680	And just by the way, I should call this out.
4517680	4519520	Erlich set up an organization,
4520240	4522320	author of The Population Bomb, of course,
4522320	4524160	called ZPG, which evolved into an organization.
4524160	4526080	Zero population growth, yeah.
4526080	4528160	It evolved into another organization
4528160	4532400	that still has something like 30,000 teachers
4532400	4534400	who train other teachers,
4534400	4539200	who educate 4 million U.S. high school kids every year,
4540240	4543120	and they explain the population problems,
4543120	4544480	usually in Africa.
4544480	4547760	And their message is, please think about this.
4547760	4550000	Yeah, well, there's nothing racist
4550000	4552160	about the too many African narrative.
4552160	4556080	Yeah, and when you teach someone like two and two as four,
4556080	4557920	you don't say, think about that.
4557920	4560160	But when you say, here's the problem in Africa,
4560160	4562720	and you say to a, think about that.
4562720	4564560	You're not really saying, think about Africa.
4564560	4567600	You're thinking about, you know, do you want the kids or not.
4567600	4570320	So that's covered in the documentary as well,
4570400	4574000	as part of the narrative as to why we still have this viewpoint,
4574000	4576720	when frankly, we should have known about this decades ago.
4576720	4578080	Well, we can also look at the
4579600	4582240	self-evident economic statistics demonstrating
4582240	4586560	that since Paul Erlich and his Population Bomb
4586560	4588400	and the Club of Rome, et cetera,
4588400	4592720	these anti-population zealots started beating the drum back in 1965,
4593760	4596400	saying that we were all going to starve to death by the year 2000
4596400	4598160	when we'll have 4 billion people.
4598160	4599840	God help us.
4599920	4604080	And now we have eight, and the relationship between wealth growth
4604080	4608560	and population has been extremely positive, not negative or flat.
4609200	4612080	And everyone on the planet virtually is richer than,
4612080	4614000	well, than anyone had ever conceived of.
4614000	4616000	And it's clearly the case that we could manage this
4616000	4617920	if we had half the will to do it.
4618640	4620480	And so the data are in.
4621600	4623360	One of the things I've really learned is that
4624400	4626640	I believe the whole idea of natural resource,
4626640	4629120	almost the whole idea of natural resource is specious.
4630000	4633840	In that human beings, the wealth of the planet
4635280	4638560	is dependent on the psychological health
4638560	4640240	and the structures of governance
4640240	4642320	that are put in place by people of good will.
4642320	4645440	And that if we organize ourselves properly and aim up,
4646080	4648880	there's no real limit to abundance.
4649680	4651680	And it's certainly not population dependent.
4651680	4653520	We're not in a zero sum game.
4653520	4656080	We are not yeast in a Petri dish.
4656720	4659200	We're not doomed to a Malthusian outcome.
4659840	4662960	And the biologists who make that claim and say it's scientific
4663520	4666880	are assuming that the yeast in the Petri dish model
4666880	4670000	of human function is the appropriate biological model.
4670720	4671520	And it's not.
4672160	4674880	And the reason for that is because we can let our ideas die
4674880	4677760	instead of us and we can learn and we can transform.
4677760	4678960	And we're very good at that.
4679600	4684000	And there's no justification whatsoever
4684960	4687760	for stating that it's a scientific fact
4687760	4691280	that population increase is going to produce a Malthusian catastrophe.
4691280	4693120	Now it can in limited circumstances,
4693120	4695520	but we are not yeast in a Petri dish.
4695520	4696560	That's the wrong model.
4697440	4699600	So and I can't disagree.
4699600	4701520	I mean, I'm a data analyst.
4701520	4704880	I'm only prepared to comment when I've done my own work
4704880	4707360	or I've seen detailed work of others.
4707360	4712400	I can't imagine how complicated it must be to model the planet.
4712400	4715040	I mean, that's on a level beyond anything.
4715200	4718880	Any rational statistician could do along.
4718880	4721280	It's models on top of models on top of models.
4722080	4724160	So where I tower of Babel.
4724160	4726560	So where I come from is to be honest with you.
4726560	4730160	I don't know, but I do know that we are adaptive.
4730160	4733920	I do know that we should prepare because to be honest with you,
4733920	4736960	you know, green technologies sound like pretty cool things
4736960	4738320	when you look at Tesla's out there.
4738320	4739360	They're not perfect, but they're.
4740960	4743360	Remember, I work with a lot of bottom of clients,
4743360	4746560	but what Elon has done for the industry, you know, is phenomenal.
4747120	4750880	And if we come at this from a point of view of positivity,
4750880	4752000	what can we do?
4752000	4754880	And I look at my own kids and well, their generation,
4754880	4758000	the malaise, the belief that the world is coming to an end.
4758000	4760960	The world is not coming to an end anytime soon.
4760960	4763440	Well, unless we precipitated in that direction,
4763440	4767040	which we seem to be striving to do with all diligence at the moment.
4767600	4770080	Well, and to bring it back to the documentary,
4770080	4774400	at this point, we come back to this point of loneliness and meet people.
4775280	4778400	I mean, there's a scene where I go to a crematorium in Germany
4779200	4787840	and I'm hoping to find out something about what it's like to bury people who have no family.
4788720	4791920	I nearly got an interview directly with the director,
4791920	4796000	but he refused to meet me and intermediary kind of sat down to explain why.
4796720	4797600	And it's horrendous.
4798240	4800640	And so this is off camera.
4801840	4806800	But I got a long note recently with more information as to what's happening.
4806800	4811120	People with no family and care homes are being effectively mistreated,
4811120	4814880	malnourished, tied to their beds for long periods of time.
4815600	4819280	And we knew this, or it's known in this crematorium,
4819280	4823840	because the bodies that come are, I guess, white and marked.
4824560	4828560	And they weren't prepared to say it because they're fearful of the system.
4828560	4832480	So someone should make a documentary about that alone,
4832480	4837200	but it tells you that the life of these people without family.
4838640	4842960	And we can't see it because these people, whether it be in a suburban Japan or in Germany
4842960	4846560	or anywhere else, these people are spending their lives in their homes alone,
4847120	4848400	hidden from the world.
4848400	4852320	So the thing is, in our culture, we only seem to be able to apprehend
4853280	4855200	life until about 30.
4855200	4856160	Like, that's our vision.
4856800	4859040	You know, the vision is you're young, you're full of promise,
4859040	4863120	you get educated, you have your career, and then you're 30.
4863120	4864080	And what's happening?
4864080	4865120	Well, now you're successful.
4865120	4868160	It's like, okay, but you got 60 years left there.
4868880	4870080	What are you going to do with that?
4871200	4874080	Well, how long is your career going to run you?
4874080	4877520	Well, you know, lots of people think about early retirement,
4877520	4881600	and that's particularly perhaps the case if you're successful economically.
4881600	4883440	So let's say you retired 50.
4883440	4885280	Okay, fair enough.
4886320	4887840	You got 45 years left.
4887840	4888960	What's your vision for that?
4889600	4891760	Well, now you're alone and you don't have a family.
4891760	4893040	You don't have a partner.
4893040	4894240	You don't have a career either.
4894960	4897520	So what are you planning to do?
4897520	4898320	Exactly.
4898320	4899520	What's your vision?
4899520	4901840	And the answer is we don't have a vision for that.
4901840	4903920	We don't have a vision for the expense of our life.
4904560	4907680	And so, and that's an interesting thing in and of itself.
4907680	4912320	I mean, you know, for a long time, back in the 1860s,
4913040	4918640	people even in the West were struggling along on less than $1.50 a day in today's money.
4918640	4923680	And it's not like people had the luxury of developing a lifetime vision.
4923680	4927680	They were sort of fending off one disaster after another,
4927680	4930480	like people do now who live in absolute privation.
4930480	4933520	There's about 800 million people like that still on the planet.
4934240	4938160	And then once you get a little wealthier, a little more secure,
4938160	4939680	you can start thinking about the future.
4939680	4942160	And that's very, very complicated.
4942160	4945760	And this luxurious wealth we have is new enough
4945760	4948720	so that our capacity to develop a lifetime vision
4948720	4952160	hasn't developed to a degree that's sophisticated enough
4952160	4954880	to take that whole time span into account.
4954880	4960400	But this vision of isolated death with no one around you that cares,
4961360	4966240	I wouldn't recommend that as your life from 70 to 95.
4967600	4969360	It's pretty damn dismal.
4969360	4975360	So, and Jordan, it's going to be worse in less industrialized nations
4975360	4979280	because you go to Brazil and as professors there, I met three of them,
4980160	4982400	the phrase they used was,
4982400	4985040	we're getting old before we got rich in Brazil.
4985040	4985600	Right.
4985600	4988880	So they can't provide the infrastructure resources to the elderly
4988880	4990800	on a level comparable to what we can.
4991440	4996320	So the life of elderly people, so when I look at India
4996320	4999280	with the birth rate now, below replacement level,
4999280	5001280	growing population because it's so young,
5001280	5003120	people are living longer, which is a good thing.
5003840	5007040	But I'm looking at a future for India 30 years from now
5007040	5009360	where you're going to have so many old people
5009920	5011760	and so few people to take care of them.
5012960	5017280	So this is a problem that we focus too much on
5017280	5018640	in our own societies.
5019360	5022160	This is a global humanitarian crisis of old people
5022160	5025760	who are going to be left by and large to some extent
5025760	5026800	to fend for themselves.
5026800	5028320	And when they're outfending for themselves,
5029520	5032080	they're going to be mostly in their homes or alone.
5033920	5036400	I find the psychological argument, I would say,
5036400	5038240	probably more compelling.
5038240	5043280	I think not because I take any issue to your forward-looking projections
5043280	5046480	but because things are so unstable
5046480	5049360	on the technological and economic and political front
5049360	5052640	that projecting even a decade into the future
5052640	5054720	seems in some ways like a fool's errand, right?
5054720	5058240	Because God only knows what's coming down the pipelines
5058240	5061120	with regards to new technology.
5061120	5063840	But I think you can make an extraordinarily strong case
5063840	5067600	that one of the things you don't want to end up happening
5067600	5072080	to you in your own life is to be involuntarily childless
5072160	5076720	and isolated starting at the age of 30 going forward, right?
5076720	5081760	And so I do, you know, I've looked at the situation in China
5081760	5084800	and in Japan with this, what do they call that,
5084800	5087200	the inverted pyramidal distribution
5087200	5089440	where there's way more old people than young people.
5089440	5092320	And obviously that seems untenable on the technological
5092320	5093680	or on the economic front.
5094240	5101760	But I do think the psychological issue is much more present,
5101760	5103600	should be much more present for young people.
5103600	5106160	And the warning is don't be thinking you've got a lot of time
5106160	5107040	to get your act together
5107040	5109200	because you don't have as much time as you think
5109200	5112400	and you want to get things going sooner than you
5113360	5114960	might find it convenient.
5114960	5116640	There's never a convenient time to have a child.
5117280	5119600	There's stupid times to have a child for sure,
5119600	5121040	but there's never a convenient time.
5121040	5122800	And that's the other thing people do too, you know.
5124080	5126320	When my wife and I finally got together,
5126320	5127520	she was about 28 or so,
5127520	5130960	she wanted to have a kid pretty, you know, pretty much right away.
5131600	5134560	And I was finishing off my post-doc
5134560	5136320	and I hadn't got a permanent job yet.
5136320	5140080	And my sense was, well, you know, everything's not in place.
5140080	5142000	And we talked that out for quite a while
5142000	5144080	and decided to proceed regardless
5144080	5148400	because there was no real reason for me to be concerned.
5148400	5150400	The probability that I was going to be jobless
5150400	5153360	was barring catastrophes zero.
5153360	5157840	And you jump into the abyss holding hands with your wife,
5157840	5159760	you know, there's no right time.
5160640	5162800	And the reason that's so important to know
5162800	5165440	is because the clock ticks while you're waiting,
5165440	5167280	and that's also a catastrophe.
5167280	5170640	And then it sneaks up on people unaware as you just described
5170640	5172560	and takes them out, not good.
5173120	5174480	Okay, so now you're talking,
5174480	5176320	now you're investigating in the documentary
5176320	5179280	the consequences of this involuntary childlessness
5179280	5181840	and do you progress past that?
5181840	5185520	Yeah, well, so the consequences go into both the economic,
5185520	5186880	we go to Detroit,
5186880	5189040	we look at what might happen to the future
5189040	5190960	of the world based on what's happened to Detroit.
5190960	5191200	Yeah.
5191920	5197040	Yeah, we look at briefly future pension systems,
5197040	5200800	we look at AI technology, but only very briefly.
5200800	5202400	It's an area that I'm sure many people
5202400	5204320	like you mentioned technology just now,
5204320	5209040	but a comment for me is that robots don't pay taxes.
5209040	5210080	So simply saying this will be-
5210080	5212480	They also don't necessarily want to take care of you.
5213360	5215040	So we'll just see how that works out.
5215600	5217040	And I think they're going to be expensive.
5217040	5220080	So the idea that AI is a solution just like this
5220880	5225280	is probably oversimplified, possibly very oversimplified,
5225280	5226320	but of course it has a role,
5226320	5228560	technology definitely has a role in this.
5228560	5230320	But we can't just turn away from this subject
5230320	5232480	and say, let's not worry about it for that reason.
5233280	5234800	The final part of the documentary,
5234800	5236960	and I have to credit a friend,
5236960	5240080	I thought it was done after filming in probably teen countries.
5240080	5241440	I thought, well, this is enough now,
5241440	5243440	kind of I can see the global pattern.
5244320	5247360	And this friend in LA said, no, you haven't finished,
5247360	5248720	you have to go to Africa.
5248720	5250880	And you have to go to other countries like Bangladesh.
5252480	5253600	And India had already been to,
5253600	5254880	but I wanted to more filming.
5254880	5255760	I wanted to go into-
5255760	5257760	We went to slums in Mumbai.
5257760	5263120	We went to slums in Rio, I think five in Johannesburg.
5264320	5267280	And I wanted to see what's happening in the parts of the world
5267280	5271200	that I think to some extent we might fear are exploding.
5272160	5275760	And you have the same fundamental story
5275760	5278480	happening everywhere, even Nigeria.
5280480	5283680	So Nigeria is a good example of a country
5283680	5288640	that's moving towards low birth rates at a much slower pace.
5288640	5291200	There'll be more people, by the way, in Nigeria
5291200	5293440	by the year 2100 than there are in China
5293440	5295200	for everyone watching at least.
5295200	5297520	That's quite the shocking bit of information.
5297520	5299360	Yeah, and you look at Nigeria,
5299360	5301760	you look at Nigeria and you still have a culture there
5301760	5304240	where the more male children you have,
5304240	5307440	it's part of what you might say, the bravado that you have.
5307440	5310320	Yeah, yeah, that's that status reward status.
5310320	5312880	But you go to Ethiopia and you meet people there
5312880	5314080	and you talk to professors there.
5314080	5315680	And Ethiopia used to be like that,
5315680	5317920	but the birth rate right now in Ethiopia is four.
5317920	5320000	It used to be seven or eight, not that long ago,
5320000	5322480	and there's a transformation happening.
5322480	5326160	So you can see and feel the transformation happening in Africa,
5326160	5327360	just like everywhere else.
5327360	5328960	So I like to think of the analogy
5328960	5330880	that the world is on a rollercoaster
5332160	5335040	and countries like Japan and Germany and Italy
5335040	5337760	and now South Korea are in the front car.
5337760	5340240	They're over in terms of the peak population
5340880	5343200	and sure they're aging and people are going to live longer
5343200	5345280	and longer, so we're not going to really see
5345280	5348640	the drop for a little while, but we know what's coming.
5349200	5351360	Africa is in the rear car.
5351360	5354480	They're still on the way up, but the path is the same here.
5354480	5359200	Yeah, but perhaps the thing that struck me about Africa,
5359200	5362240	where I'm planning to go back and spend a significant amount of time
5362240	5365440	for my own purposes as much as anything,
5365440	5368240	when you go to Africa, you go to Malawi,
5368240	5370320	which is, I believe, World Bank data,
5370320	5374000	the 12th poorest country in the world by GDP per person.
5375680	5379440	And you go to a community and people are laughing, smiling.
5380000	5383520	And you go to kind of an area, it's not even a soccer pitch,
5383520	5386000	it's nothing like a soccer pitch, but there's a soccer ball there.
5386000	5389920	There's no rules, but you've got 30 kids running and screaming and laughing.
5389920	5393040	And we're there, and they come and say hi for a moment,
5393040	5395040	but they want to get back and play soccer with each other.
5395840	5398320	And to see that sense of community
5399040	5401360	and that intergenerational community,
5402240	5405360	maybe in some ways part of a solution here that we've,
5405360	5408240	I think an argument for me is that we've lost a sense of community
5408240	5409440	for one reason or another.
5410400	5418720	And so that's something that surprised me, actually, how similar, really,
5418720	5423600	we all are, and we're just different parts of that cycle.
5425600	5428800	So you've laid out this documentary,
5428800	5434000	and you've documented a problem that is not being attended to much.
5434880	5436960	That's a very pervasive problem,
5436960	5442720	and that's going to affect virtually everyone personally and sociologically.
5443360	5446080	We talked a little bit about pathways.
5447760	5449920	It's one thing, obviously, to diagnose a problem,
5449920	5452000	and that's not a straightforward thing to do,
5452000	5453840	to see the problem and then to diagnose it.
5454560	5458160	It's a completely different order of things to start thinking about
5458160	5460560	what might constitute an acceptable alternative.
5460560	5463200	So in Hungary, what they've done, you probably know this,
5463200	5467680	is that if you're a mother in Hungary and you have one child,
5468560	5472320	you're now exempt from income tax at the federal level for the rest of your life,
5472320	5477200	25%, and then that scales up to 100% for four children.
5477200	5480240	And the idea there was both practical and cultural.
5480240	5485840	So the cultural idea was we need to signal that we value motherhood and children.
5486400	5492880	And one of the more powerful signals that society has access to
5492880	5493920	is economic signals.
5493920	5498160	And the Hungarians have stopped the decline in their birth rate and tapped it up slightly.
5498160	5501920	They've increased female participation in the workforce, by the way, 13%.
5502960	5505120	So the feminists had objected, or some of them,
5505120	5509360	that the Hungarian government was just turning women into baby-making factories,
5509360	5514080	which is hell of a nasty epithet, I might add.
5514080	5516480	But what's happened is the reverse.
5516480	5518400	As more women are working now than before,
5518400	5520640	and I suppose that's because they get to keep more of their money,
5521600	5525520	and they can make childcare arrangements more straightforwardly and all of that,
5525520	5528560	they've knocked a divorce rate down substantively.
5528560	5530160	They've increased the marriage rate.
5530160	5535040	They've knocked the abortion rate down 40%, 38%, with no compulsion.
5535040	5539520	It's not as easy to get an abortion in Hungary as it is in the US or Canada.
5540160	5545520	And the legal limits there is 12 weeks instead of the 16 weeks,
5545520	5548080	which is about what Americans think it should be.
5548080	5556320	But the point is these alterations in policy have produced increases in fertility,
5556320	5559200	increases in the marital rate, decreases in the divorce rate,
5559200	5563360	decreases in the abortion rate, and those look arguably like desirable things.
5565120	5568560	And we talked a little bit about the fact that women live seven years longer,
5568560	5572720	and so in principle, have a time, let's say eight years,
5572720	5576880	where they could have children without really being at a competitive disadvantage
5576880	5581040	on the economic front with men, assuming that it is a competitive landscape,
5581040	5583200	and that's also not particularly obvious to me.
5583840	5591600	I mean, have your thoughts turned to what might constitute an appropriate pathway forward
5591600	5592800	for young people?
5592800	5600000	Well, I certainly would quite boldly say what will not work,
5600000	5603600	because there's so many examples of things that have been tried and tried and tried and tried.
5603600	5606000	Now, we'll come back to Hungary in a moment, because it is very interesting.
5607600	5611680	But if you look at baby bonus programs globally,
5611680	5615840	at best, what they do is temporarily increase the birth rate,
5617040	5620560	and then you see a dip, and the dip usually goes below where it was before.
5620560	5626160	All you've done is bring forward the people who would have had kids anyway.
5626160	5627600	Yeah, yeah, right, right.
5628240	5631440	So we, and you look at the amount of money in certain Japan,
5631440	5634240	certainly South Korea are spending on kindergarten.
5634240	5635680	Yeah, yeah, that doesn't seem to help.
5635680	5637200	Quebec, it didn't make a bit of difference.
5637200	5637760	Yeah, yeah.
5637760	5638480	No, it isn't.
5638480	5641040	It isn't lack of childcare that's causing this problem.
5641040	5642720	Yeah, and it's not income either.
5642720	5643840	No, right.
5643840	5645360	A lot of people think it is income.
5645360	5647440	It's a natural thing, I think, for people thinking,
5647440	5650000	well, if I had a little bit more money at the right time,
5650560	5652240	or my apartment's too small,
5652240	5656400	but actually what you find is that when people have more money in their pocket,
5656400	5657440	birth rates go down.
5657440	5657600	Yeah, right.
5657600	5658400	They do other things.
5658400	5658800	Yeah, yeah.
5658800	5660960	It's like, not yet, we can take this vacation.
5660960	5662000	Well, I think also,
5662080	5666080	well, I also think that their expectations for what constitutes
5666080	5668720	sufficiently prepared for children also change.
5669840	5671440	Like I said, when I was in Montreal,
5671440	5673040	well, I was already educated.
5673040	5673840	I had a job.
5673840	5675360	It was clear I was going to get a job,
5675360	5678800	but my standard for what was sufficient security
5678800	5680320	and opportunity for my children
5680320	5683920	rose along with my horizon of vision on the economic front.
5683920	5687280	And it's also not the case that more security makes you
5688080	5689920	likeable to take more risks.
5689920	5691200	That isn't how life works.
5691200	5692640	You have to jump into children,
5692640	5694880	just like you jump into a marriage
5694880	5697360	or into your life for that matter.
5697360	5698640	I think that's the key point.
5698640	5701920	So ultimately, Hungary aside for a moment,
5701920	5703280	and also Russia in the past,
5703280	5704880	has had similar programs
5704880	5707680	where they have put significant benefits in place
5707680	5709440	that seem to work for a time.
5710640	5714880	But vast majority of financial incentives
5714880	5717920	or even societal changes
5718000	5721840	such as kindergartens have very limited effects,
5721840	5723520	very limited indeed.
5723520	5725200	Now, if we come back to understand
5725200	5726320	the fundamentals of the problem,
5726320	5729520	there's this unplanned childlessness issue.
5730480	5733840	Perhaps what Hungary might have got right,
5734560	5739600	and I will never frankly tell someone
5739600	5741200	you should or should not have an abortion.
5741200	5742000	That's your choice.
5742000	5744080	That's not something I want to have any say.
5744080	5746400	I don't believe that's my right to say that.
5746960	5748640	That's just my personal position on it.
5748640	5752560	But what Hungary might have done,
5752560	5754640	and you stated a moment ago,
5754640	5759120	is just make it more positive, the idea of parenting.
5759120	5760560	It's something that people want to do.
5760560	5761680	That's what they're aiming at.
5762480	5764800	The Hungarians do understand.
5764800	5766640	So their president, Catalan Novak,
5767280	5771040	young dynamic woman who is their symbolic head of state,
5771040	5773680	was very much involved in the formulation
5773680	5774960	of these family policies.
5774960	5778800	And she knew perfectly well that part of what the goal was,
5778800	5783040	was to culturally elevate the, let's call it,
5783040	5784960	the sacred significance of motherhood,
5784960	5785680	something like that,
5785680	5790720	to put the mother again on something approximating
5790720	5792400	the necessary pedestal.
5792400	5794880	You see this in Catholic imagery all the time,
5794880	5797600	is that, of course, in the Christian tradition,
5797600	5799600	Christ is obviously the central figure
5799600	5801120	of redemption and divinity,
5801120	5804720	but there's strong competition symbolically
5804720	5805840	on the part of Mary,
5805840	5807440	because it's Mary and the infant.
5807440	5809280	And I would say any society
5809280	5811920	that doesn't hold the mother and infant as sacred is doomed.
5813280	5814480	For obvious reasons,
5814480	5816960	since we all had mothers and were all infants,
5816960	5820400	if you don't value that, whatever that value means.
5820400	5822080	And when my wife had little kids,
5822800	5825760	she was treated pretty damn dismal, I would say.
5825760	5827920	I used to go out to restaurants with her
5827920	5830080	and just watch when she entered in with the kids.
5830080	5831840	And there was a lot of sneers
5831840	5836480	and a lot of casual mistreatment.
5836480	5839280	There was no, they were a nuisance.
5839280	5841600	And that was extremely annoying to me to watch,
5841600	5843200	because I don't think of kids as,
5843200	5845440	kids can be nuisances if they're not well behaved,
5845440	5847920	but there's something wrong with you
5847920	5850400	if you think children are fundamentally a nuisance.
5851200	5855360	And it's definitely the case that we don't value
5856320	5860880	the contribution of young mothers in our culture,
5860880	5863680	the way that we would if we were wise.
5863680	5866400	And that's a very difficult problem to solve, right?
5866400	5869600	All this emphasis on the kind of hedonic freedom
5869600	5872800	that's associated with being a youthful teenager.
5872800	5874960	And then that equally sex in the city,
5874960	5879200	nonsense about your freedom on the sexual front,
5879200	5880480	while you're pursuing your career,
5880480	5883280	so bloody juvenile that it's almost incomprehensible.
5883280	5885040	But it's not an easy thing to reverse.
5885040	5886480	And it isn't even obvious
5886480	5889360	that it's the government's role to reverse that,
5889360	5892800	but, and the outcomes are unplanned childlessness.
5892800	5894560	I, you know, just time and time again,
5894560	5899280	I think it's just clear that people who go down that path
5899280	5901120	are thinking of what society tells them
5901120	5902800	they can do in the short term only.
5902800	5907280	That'd be a good title for this interview, really.
5907280	5909520	We should probably call it unplanned childlessness.
5909520	5910160	I love that.
5910160	5912320	Well, because that is so,
5913280	5916960	it's so interesting that that exists as such a plague,
5916960	5918400	and yet it isn't identified,
5918400	5920000	and it doesn't have a name.
5920000	5922240	And that's a real, that's a real catastrophe.
5923280	5925520	I, you know, one of the earliest greetings I did,
5925520	5927600	there was a young man who was in Japan,
5927600	5928880	but he was, he's from the U.S.
5929600	5932400	And he just stood there afterwards gazing at the ceiling,
5932400	5935360	and he's probably 30, early 30, 35.
5936080	5938240	And he said, unplanned childlessness.
5938240	5940640	And he looked at me and said, that's me.
5942560	5943040	That's me.
5943840	5945920	And you could see it wasn't just the term,
5945920	5946960	it was talking.
5946960	5947440	Yeah, right.
5947440	5948000	He was talking.
5948000	5948800	The realization.
5948800	5949520	Realization.
5949520	5952960	You actually have to, in some way, have a plan,
5952960	5956640	even if the plan is to do something not irrational,
5956640	5961360	but to take a leap of faith and to come back to men as well.
5962960	5965120	Men can have children aged 55.
5966640	5972160	You know, I divorced, sadly, at around 40, I guess,
5972160	5974880	and I thought there'd be a time where I would meet someone again
5974880	5975680	and have more children.
5975680	5977360	That's something I would have desired, frankly.
5978160	5981920	Not to get too personal, but it wasn't my plan for life
5981920	5983520	to be a divorced dad.
5983520	5984560	Right, right.
5984560	5990160	And what you find is that you're competing with younger men
5990160	5991120	for the same younger woman.
5991120	5992160	Easier said than done.
5992160	5993280	Easier said than done.
5993280	5995680	The fact that you can technically have a child
5995680	5999360	at almost any age as a man doesn't mean that you're going to.
5999360	6000560	So the outcome is...
6000560	6001280	No, no, no.
6001280	6003520	What makes you think you're going to be more successful,
6003520	6006000	old and ugly, than you had been young and ugly?
6006640	6007680	So, yeah, yeah.
6007680	6010400	And every year you're on the path to get older and uglier.
6011600	6016400	So, you know, it's men and women in this situation,
6016400	6019200	I think, that society needs to make parenting
6020000	6021440	something more valuable.
6021440	6024080	But to come back to your point, that cannot be
6024080	6026640	at the sacrifice of career education options.
6026640	6031200	We have to make it more almost the default option
6032080	6034640	that you can continue your education.
6034640	6037120	I love the idea of lifelong learning, which is what I'm doing.
6038320	6041840	Yeah, well, it's very odd that we orient our educational
6041840	6044320	establishments to people between 18 and 22.
6044320	6045520	I just can't figure that at all.
6045520	6047600	I taught at the Harvard Extension School, by the way.
6047600	6050800	I had a lot of adult students and I enjoyed teaching them a lot.
6050800	6053520	There's absolutely no reason whatsoever
6053520	6056720	that the university should specialize in 18 to 22-year-olds.
6057600	6061200	That's a hangover from, I don't know, God,
6061200	6063840	I don't even know when that was useful and relevant.
6063840	6065920	It's just not a smart idea.
6065920	6068800	And it's in the college's interest, because as a shrinking number
6068800	6071760	of children come through the systems,
6071760	6074160	universities are going to need to diversify.
6074160	6076400	Lifelong learning is the answer to that.
6076400	6077040	So why?
6077040	6079440	Well, it's also the case that in an era of rapid
6079440	6082880	technological transformation, that lifelong learning is
6082880	6084160	necessary practically.
6084160	6086640	But it's also, why the hell wouldn't you want that?
6086640	6088320	Because it's part of what keeps you updated.
6089520	6091760	I remember the first class I took at the Extension School.
6091760	6094160	It was in statistics that I went to my first class,
6094160	6096400	probably dressed like I am now with a leather briefcase.
6096400	6100880	And everyone else, I was not the oldest at all.
6100880	6103920	But everyone else is in jeans and t-shirts and backpacks.
6103920	6108080	And I thought, well, I haven't dressed like that for decades.
6108080	6111120	But I went out and I got a couple of t-shirts and a backpack.
6111840	6115760	And the most transformational thing happened to me.
6116320	6119760	First recognition, I'm learning something I want to learn.
6119760	6120320	Yeah, right?
6120320	6121520	I'm fully engaged.
6121520	6123840	And that makes you the best kind of student, too.
6123840	6124640	I think so.
6124640	6128720	But everyone else, there were Harvard College kids there
6128720	6129840	taking summer classes.
6129840	6131200	And there were people older than me.
6131200	6132000	It didn't matter.
6133040	6134720	I love teaching at the Extension School.
6134720	6139600	I mean, at Harvard, the undergraduates in the formal school
6139600	6142960	were smarter than the people on average in the Extension
6142960	6143520	School.
6143520	6146240	But the Extension School people were a lot more motivated
6146240	6146640	to learn.
6147680	6150320	There was no one not attending because they were there
6150320	6152000	because they wanted to be there, right?
6152000	6154320	So I'm probably asking questions that were,
6154320	6157920	I actually took a psychology class probably in the building
6157920	6159200	of William James.
6159200	6160160	Yeah, William James.
6160160	6160560	Yeah.
6160560	6166320	And again, I was there with a lot of even high school learners
6166320	6167360	at a summer school program.
6167920	6170000	But I realized the professor was enjoying the questions
6170000	6170640	I was asking.
6170640	6170800	Yeah, yeah.
6170800	6172480	But they were just different to the question.
6172480	6172880	Yeah, yeah.
6172880	6174080	They're serious questions, right?
6174080	6174720	Yeah.
6174720	6175680	So when were you there?
6176720	6178800	I started in 2015, 2016.
6178800	6181200	I would have taken the psychology probably one-on-one,
6181200	6181600	of course.
6181600	6188640	But the point is that the recruitment cycle for many career
6188640	6190800	options is linked to the education cycle.
6190800	6192560	So you can't change one without the other.
6192560	6193120	Yeah, yeah.
6193120	6195600	You have enough people say, well, it's fine.
6196240	6198560	Certain companies allow recruitment later in life,
6198560	6200080	but it's not the normal thing to do.
6200080	6200160	Yeah.
6200160	6200800	It's a risk.
6201520	6204320	So if you're a woman or a parent taking time out to raise
6204320	6207600	a family because you think you want to do that exclusively
6207600	6211120	on your own, that's a risk that you might not get on that path
6211120	6212480	and you might not get the recruitment.
6212480	6214480	Yeah, you know, I don't really buy that.
6214480	6216960	I don't really buy that because I had one student,
6216960	6222480	for example, Shelly Carson.
6223920	6228960	She came back to Harvard as a graduate student in her 40s.
6228960	6231600	I was younger than her as her supervisor.
6231600	6234400	She'd been an airline stewardess, pretty middle-class life,
6235200	6237280	had been out of the academic stream for quite a while,
6237280	6240400	and was quite a lot older than most of the graduate students.
6240400	6244640	And she hit it hard and developed a bang-up career,
6244640	6246640	and she's managed that quite successfully.
6246640	6249680	And I think that that's not normal.
6249680	6252480	It's not the standard practice, but it's by no means impossible.
6252480	6255360	And given that women do have that seven-year advantage
6255360	6260720	in terms of lifespan, there's, man, you think you're out of the running
6260720	6263760	on the education and career front when you're 35.
6263760	6266000	You're out of the running on the reproductive front.
6266000	6266400	Yes.
6266400	6269040	You're not really out of the running on the education and career front.
6269040	6274160	And I've seen lots of people hit the education ground running
6274160	6278960	in their 30s, mid-30s, sometimes later, and have a whole new career.
6278960	6283040	I mean, Jesus, at 40, you could still have 30 years at your new career.
6283040	6283760	Yeah.
6283760	6286640	So that's a very optimistic way of looking at it.
6286640	6287360	Yeah.
6287360	6291200	And so, all right, so well, for everybody watching and listening on YouTube
6291200	6295040	and its associated platforms, thank you very much for your time and attention.
6295840	6300880	And to Stephen Shaw for agreeing to talk to me today about birth gap
6300880	6306240	and about the issue of declining birth rates and population shrinkage,
6307760	6311520	bringing that to everyone's attention, bringing the issue of unplanned
6311520	6316000	childlessness to everyone's attention, because that's a crucial issue here
6316000	6319200	to note the existence of a problem and to give it a name
6319200	6322320	is to bring it out of the darkness and to unshroud it, let's say.
6322880	6324800	And that's an extremely useful thing to do.
6325440	6330400	And I'm going to talk to Stephen for another half an hour on the DailyWirePlus platform.
6330400	6333200	I like to spend half an hour with my guests,
6334240	6338880	investigating how their pathway through life made it manifest,
6338880	6343360	made itself manifest to them both in terms of the problems that gripped them,
6344480	6347520	the concerns they had, both voluntary and involuntary,
6347520	6350400	and the opportunities that presented themselves as a consequence.
6350400	6355200	And so if you're interested in that, then please head over to the DailyWirePlus platform.
6355200	6357120	You could consider supporting them in any case.
6357120	6363280	They have also worked diligently to make the kind of conversations I had today possible.
6363280	6366720	And that's much appreciated to the film crew here in Vancouver,
6366720	6367840	because that's where I am today.
6367840	6368800	Thank you very much.
6368800	6371680	And thank you all for your time and attention.
6372400	6373280	Good to talk with you.
6373280	6373760	Yeah.
6373760	6374640	Yeah, you bet.
6374640	6375040	You bet.
6375760	6376800	Hello, everyone.
6376800	6387280	I would encourage you to continue listening to my conversation with my guest on DailyWirePlus.com.
