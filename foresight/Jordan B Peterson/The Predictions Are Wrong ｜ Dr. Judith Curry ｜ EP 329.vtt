WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.120
It leaves me open mouthed in amazement that we in the developed world with our functional

00:07.120 --> 00:12.840
economies and our high level of luxury and security can say to developing worlds the

00:12.840 --> 00:16.800
developing world, well, you know, we've got a pretty good here and we're probably willing

00:16.800 --> 00:21.800
to cut back a little bit, but you guys down there in the developing countries, you know,

00:21.800 --> 00:24.800
you should be pretty damn careful about your carbon output.

00:24.800 --> 00:29.080
We're not going to help you develop your economy so that you can benefit from the same industrial

00:29.080 --> 00:35.640
revolution that has enabled us to educate our children and to have plenty to eat and

00:35.640 --> 00:38.240
to be warm in the winter and cool in the summer.

00:38.240 --> 00:43.320
And then what's even more preposterous is it's the very people who are constantly clamoring

00:43.320 --> 00:50.120
about the oppressive nature of Western culture who are foisting this very story on these

00:50.120 --> 00:51.440
developed countries.

00:51.440 --> 00:59.440
Yeah, the irony is that even if the African nations were given, you know, the carbon credits

00:59.440 --> 01:05.440
or whatever and allowed to develop to where they want to be and where anyone expects them

01:05.440 --> 01:11.360
to be, at most they would be emitting like five or six percent of global emissions and

01:11.360 --> 01:15.960
this is for like a billion people in the population.

01:15.960 --> 01:20.400
We're not talking about a lot of extra emissions to allow them to develop.

01:20.960 --> 01:24.920
I mean, it just makes absolutely no sense and it's evil.

01:24.920 --> 01:26.320
It's absolutely evil.

01:40.320 --> 01:43.160
Hello everyone on YouTube and associated platforms.

01:43.160 --> 01:47.160
I'm here today with another climate denialist because, you know, I've been racking those

01:47.160 --> 01:48.160
up.

01:48.280 --> 01:52.440
It's all part of my attempt to become the most reprehensible commentator on YouTube.

01:52.440 --> 01:56.080
And so, at least in the eyes of those who think they're my enemies.

01:56.080 --> 02:00.240
Anyways, I'm talking to Dr. Judith Curry today, a very accomplished scientist.

02:00.240 --> 02:05.760
She's an American climatologist with a bachelor in science degree in geography, she earned

02:05.760 --> 02:10.240
out at Northern Illinois University and a geophysical sciences PhD from the University

02:10.240 --> 02:11.760
of Chicago.

02:11.760 --> 02:16.520
Curry is the professor emerita and former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric

02:16.520 --> 02:19.880
Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

02:19.880 --> 02:23.760
She's had an accomplished career working with NASA, the U.S. government and numerous

02:23.760 --> 02:27.520
academic institutions in the field of climate change.

02:27.520 --> 02:35.160
A real scientist with 190 publications, Curry advocates, so reprehensibly, for a non-alarmist

02:35.160 --> 02:39.240
approach acknowledging Earth's rising temperature with a grain of salt.

02:39.240 --> 02:44.280
The grain being in field research and a refusal to shut the doors of science to those with

02:44.320 --> 02:46.520
contrary views and findings.

02:46.520 --> 02:52.240
In 2017, Dr. Curry retired from reposition at the Georgia Institute of Technology, citing

02:52.240 --> 02:59.760
the poisonous nature of the scientific discussion around man-made climate change as a key factor.

02:59.760 --> 03:04.880
Curry co-founded and acts as president of the Climate Forecast Applications Network,

03:04.880 --> 03:09.600
a company, a private company which seeks to translate cutting-edge weather and climate

03:09.600 --> 03:13.280
research into tenable forecast products.

03:13.280 --> 03:17.280
Insurance companies, financial institutions rely on Dr. Curry to provide them with information

03:17.280 --> 03:22.360
that can guide them with regard to their future financial decision-making.

03:22.360 --> 03:27.000
She's a controversial figure on the climate front, being somewhat of a contrarian in regard

03:27.000 --> 03:32.440
to the hypothetical scientific consensus on the climate apocalypse front.

03:32.440 --> 03:36.840
So the first thing I'd like to ask you, Dr. Curry, is if you would walk people through

03:36.840 --> 03:44.160
your professional qualifications and to let everyone know why it is that you might be

03:44.160 --> 03:47.640
regarded as a credible commentator on such issues.

03:47.640 --> 03:56.800
Okay, well I received my PhD in 1982 in Geophysical Sciences from the University of Chicago.

03:56.800 --> 04:05.440
And I spent my entire career in academia with jobs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,

04:05.440 --> 04:13.360
Purdue University, Penn State University, University of Colorado Boulder, and most recently

04:13.360 --> 04:16.520
at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

04:16.520 --> 04:22.400
And at Georgia Tech, I served as chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences

04:22.400 --> 04:27.080
for 13 years.

04:27.080 --> 04:34.080
I've written several books and published about 190 journal articles.

04:34.080 --> 04:42.360
I'm a fellow of several major professional societies, have received some recognition

04:42.360 --> 04:45.280
for my research.

04:45.280 --> 04:49.960
I left my university position in 2017.

04:49.960 --> 04:53.600
I felt it was too constraining.

04:53.600 --> 04:57.960
I wanted to do a broader range of things.

04:57.960 --> 05:02.160
And I had started a company about 10 years before.

05:02.160 --> 05:09.320
It was a startup under Georgia Tech's Venture Lab program.

05:09.320 --> 05:17.360
And so then I started devoting full time to it after I left academia.

05:17.360 --> 05:26.920
I inadvertently stepped into the limelight on the global warming issue in 2005.

05:26.920 --> 05:35.200
If you recall at the time of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans, I and my co-authors

05:35.200 --> 05:44.120
had a paper that was published in the journal Science two weeks after Katrina hit.

05:44.120 --> 05:52.080
And we had found that the percentage of category four and five hurricanes had doubled in recent

05:52.080 --> 05:53.480
decades.

05:53.480 --> 06:00.120
And so this was with rather explosive media attention.

06:00.120 --> 06:06.840
And this was the first time that I did TV interviews or anything like that.

06:06.840 --> 06:12.720
And it was a very antagonistic debate.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.840
People were coming at us from all sides.

06:14.840 --> 06:21.720
Of course, the Enviro advocacy groups thought I was the greatest thing since sliced bread.

06:21.840 --> 06:30.400
There are a lot of people on the other side of the debate thought I was absolutely evil.

06:30.400 --> 06:36.160
So for the first time, I started giving a lot of public lectures.

06:36.160 --> 06:42.040
And people would invariably ask me questions that were outside of my expertise or knowledge.

06:42.040 --> 06:47.160
Everyone was asking about the hockey stick, for example, or what's going on with the sun

06:47.160 --> 06:48.160
and all these kind of things.

06:48.160 --> 06:55.720
And I figure, oh, my gosh, I really need to just step out beyond my personal areas of

06:55.720 --> 07:02.320
expertise and try to understand a lot more of this, which I did.

07:02.320 --> 07:09.240
And eventually the hurricane and global warming issues settled down a little bit.

07:09.240 --> 07:14.480
And then a few years later, climate gates struck.

07:14.480 --> 07:22.560
This was in November of 2009 with the unauthorized release of emails from the University of East

07:22.560 --> 07:23.560
Anglia.

07:23.560 --> 07:31.680
It was a very big scandal at the time, IPCC authors hiding the decline, Mike's nature

07:31.680 --> 07:34.800
trick, all this kind of stuff.

07:34.800 --> 07:40.320
And it was hugely important politically and it's believed to have derailed the Waxman

07:40.320 --> 07:47.440
Markey bill that was making progress towards being passed.

07:47.440 --> 07:50.360
And then this just pretty much derailed it.

07:50.360 --> 07:58.120
And I took the controversial step of saying, we need to do better.

07:58.120 --> 08:01.920
We need to make all of our data publicly available.

08:01.920 --> 08:04.360
We need to make our methods transparent.

08:04.360 --> 08:10.040
We need to pay more attention to uncertainty and be more honest about the level of confidence

08:10.120 --> 08:12.800
we actually have in this stuff.

08:12.800 --> 08:21.280
And we also need to pay attention to skeptics and treat them with respect and pay attention

08:21.280 --> 08:25.200
to their arguments and refute them if they're serious.

08:25.200 --> 08:30.880
And to me, this sounded like motherhood and apple pie kind of thing.

08:30.880 --> 08:31.880
Right, absolutely.

08:31.880 --> 08:38.120
Okay, but the people within the climate community were very angry at me, saying that I needed

08:38.200 --> 08:43.680
to be more sensitive to the feelings of the scientists who were involved.

08:43.680 --> 08:50.880
Excuse me, no one was sensitive to my feelings during the hurricane and global warming wars.

08:50.880 --> 08:53.440
And also, I wasn't worried about their feelings.

08:53.440 --> 09:02.320
I was worried about the IPCC and the credibility of it and what we should be doing about this.

09:02.320 --> 09:10.040
There were much bigger issues at stake here than the feelings of these scientists.

09:10.040 --> 09:15.200
Well, anybody, any scientist who talks to you about whether you're hurting their feelings

09:15.200 --> 09:20.240
when you're launching a discussion of the factual basis of their claims has immediately

09:20.240 --> 09:22.200
stepped outside of the scientific domain.

09:22.200 --> 09:28.400
I mean, one of the things I loved about being a scientist was that the rules of engagement

09:28.400 --> 09:33.200
at professional conferences, let's say, that were genuinely scientific in nature were pretty

09:33.200 --> 09:34.200
damn clear.

09:34.200 --> 09:42.600
I mean, we were discussing the empirical and statistical reliability and validity of your

09:42.600 --> 09:45.120
claims on a technical basis.

09:45.120 --> 09:46.120
That was that.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.800
And if we weren't doing that, it wasn't science.

09:47.800 --> 09:52.960
And so the idea that what you should be attending to when you're criticizing someone's work,

09:52.960 --> 09:56.880
which doesn't mean denigrating it, it means trying to separate the wheat from the chaff,

09:56.880 --> 09:57.880
by the way.

09:57.880 --> 10:03.440
It has nothing to do with your regard for the emotional well-being of your, say, antagonist.

10:03.440 --> 10:07.560
I mean, you could be polite and that's helpful, but it's also not mandatory.

10:07.560 --> 10:08.560
Right.

10:08.560 --> 10:13.040
But well, there's a subtlety here because I was not so much criticizing the substance

10:13.040 --> 10:20.640
of the science, but the behavior of the scientists that I felt violated the norms of science

10:20.640 --> 10:32.320
in terms of everybody, universalism, everybody should have a chance or a shot at the data.

10:32.320 --> 10:40.320
We should listen to skeptics and we should try to keep politics out of our science to

10:40.320 --> 10:42.000
the extent that we can.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.120
I mean, these are the kind of behaviors.

10:46.120 --> 10:52.360
These emails reveal people trying to get editors fired, playing fast and loose with

10:52.360 --> 11:00.520
the guidelines of the IPCC, evade Freedom of Information Act requests from people they

11:00.520 --> 11:02.340
thought would challenge their research.

11:02.340 --> 11:07.640
This kind of behavior that I strenuously objected to and I thought that we should not defend

11:07.640 --> 11:08.720
and we should call out.

11:08.720 --> 11:12.760
So I was not challenging the substance of anybody's science.

11:12.760 --> 11:18.480
It was really the behavior in the public debate on climate.

11:18.480 --> 11:19.480
Right.

11:19.480 --> 11:22.920
Well, that is a form of, that is a form in some sense of methodological criticism.

11:22.920 --> 11:23.920
Yes.

11:23.920 --> 11:29.680
I mean, your point was that there's rules to the investigative process and the communication

11:29.680 --> 11:34.880
process and politicization breaks those rules and the response on the front of the climate

11:34.880 --> 11:40.000
apocalypse, let's say, you see this with biologists who are concerned about extinction from time

11:40.000 --> 11:46.400
to time too, is that, well, this issue is so important that it's unethical to abide by

11:46.400 --> 11:50.760
those normative principles because we need to do everything we can to draw as much attention

11:50.760 --> 11:56.080
to this looming catastrophe as possible and in some sense, all is fair in love and war.

11:56.080 --> 12:01.440
And that would be fine if they were correct and 100% correct possibly, although I still

12:01.440 --> 12:05.280
think they're violating the science politics distinction.

12:05.280 --> 12:10.800
But when there's doubt and there's substantial doubt here, then that's a real problem.

12:10.800 --> 12:14.960
I wanted to take apart some of the things you said, so you came at this in a very interesting

12:14.960 --> 12:19.640
way in some sense because the first time that you rose to something approximating public

12:19.640 --> 12:24.880
prominence, you were actually putting forth a set of propositions that you could argue

12:24.880 --> 12:31.360
supported a more dire view of climate outcome, making the claim that these hurricanes, severe

12:31.360 --> 12:33.420
hurricanes had increased in frequency.

12:33.420 --> 12:38.680
Do you believe now that have they continued to increase in frequency or was that a momentary

12:38.680 --> 12:39.680
spike?

12:39.680 --> 12:40.680
Do you know that literature still?

12:40.680 --> 12:41.680
Oh, yes.

12:41.680 --> 12:47.800
Okay, first off, there were lots of potshots thrown at us.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.920
The couple of criticisms turned out to be valid.

12:50.920 --> 12:57.200
One is that the global data before 1985 is pretty dodgy.

12:57.200 --> 13:04.360
We went back to 1970, so realistically, you have to throw out 15 years.

13:04.360 --> 13:10.960
And the other thing was looking at just the natural variability and could we really distinguish

13:10.960 --> 13:14.480
a warming signal from the natural variability?

13:14.480 --> 13:18.240
And at this point, we still can't with a lot of confidence.

13:18.240 --> 13:24.840
Yeah, well, a big part of the problem here is what time frame over, this is a huge problem

13:24.920 --> 13:26.880
and I don't even know how you solve it in some sense.

13:26.880 --> 13:33.920
If you're trying to define something like a trend towards cooling or warming or increased

13:33.920 --> 13:38.280
or decreased variability, the question that immediately arises, well, are you talking

13:38.280 --> 13:43.200
about a hundred years or a thousand or 10,000 or a million, like there's an infinite number

13:43.200 --> 13:45.160
of time frames to consider and-

13:45.160 --> 13:48.360
Exactly, that is a key challenge.

13:48.360 --> 13:54.400
And one of my major themes coming out of the climate gate thing was a more serious look

13:54.400 --> 13:56.200
at uncertainty.

13:56.200 --> 14:01.920
And I wrote a paper called Climate Change and the Uncertainty Monster.

14:01.920 --> 14:09.560
And I used that paper, a series of, you know, to launch my blog, Climate Etc, JudithCarré.com

14:09.560 --> 14:12.000
in 2010.

14:12.000 --> 14:19.840
And again, this was people outside the clique of establishment climate scientists thought

14:19.840 --> 14:20.840
this was great.

14:20.840 --> 14:21.840
This is important.

14:21.840 --> 14:22.840
This is obvious.

14:22.880 --> 14:28.800
However, within the clique, they viewed me as trying to destroy a consensus that they

14:28.800 --> 14:31.240
had been trying to build for 20 years.

14:31.240 --> 14:38.320
Well, this manufactured consensus and it was on very flimsy ground, you know, and there

14:38.320 --> 14:39.320
was no-

14:39.320 --> 14:43.080
Okay, how would you characterize that so-called consensus?

14:43.080 --> 14:44.800
Is that associated with this idea?

14:44.800 --> 14:49.080
I talked to Richard Frenzen about this recently.

14:49.080 --> 14:54.840
Is that associated with the idea that like 97% of scientists agree that, well, it isn't

14:54.840 --> 14:59.520
clear what they agree, that's the issue, is that climate change is a severe and catastrophic

14:59.520 --> 15:03.920
problem, which is that statement in itself is not true by any stretch of the imagination.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.680
What's the consensus here?

15:05.680 --> 15:11.880
Okay, the issue is the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

15:11.880 --> 15:17.480
They did their first assessment report in like 1991 and following that, I mean, that was

15:17.480 --> 15:18.480
a good report.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.800
There was a good assessment at the time.

15:20.800 --> 15:26.720
And then the powers that be says we need to strive for consensus in our statements.

15:26.720 --> 15:31.640
And so this sort of narrowed the framing and the people they were picking to be on the

15:31.640 --> 15:34.360
committee were people who were all going to agree.

15:34.360 --> 15:39.800
And so they were working to manufacture a consensus.

15:39.800 --> 15:45.680
You know, it was their view of how the policy process deals with uncertainty.

15:45.680 --> 15:51.560
So it was sort of a speaking consensus to power approach.

15:51.560 --> 15:55.000
And this was like formalized by the IPCC.

15:55.000 --> 16:02.720
And you know, people challenging the consensus, and there's many dimensions to it, but the

16:02.720 --> 16:10.760
most fundamental one is that most of the warming that we've seen since 1950 is caused by humans.

16:10.760 --> 16:14.880
I mean, that's the most central consensus statement.

16:14.920 --> 16:19.280
There is warming, that there is warming, even though now the narrative has changed, that

16:19.280 --> 16:20.760
there is warming.

16:20.760 --> 16:23.240
There's a certain idea about its potential magnitude.

16:23.240 --> 16:28.800
And then hypothetically, the consensus is that what, about 50% of that is to do human

16:28.800 --> 16:29.800
activity?

16:29.800 --> 16:36.720
No, they used to make the statement more than half, but they really meant 100%.

16:36.720 --> 16:43.040
But there's certainly no scientific consensus that 100% of the global warming that's occurring

16:43.040 --> 16:45.120
at the moment is anthropogenic.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.120
I don't believe it.

16:46.120 --> 16:50.680
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, there isn't a scientific, okay.

16:50.680 --> 16:51.680
There's no measure.

16:51.680 --> 17:00.840
I mean, when you have a complex, highly uncertain situation like this, the issue of consensus

17:00.840 --> 17:02.640
is scientifically meaningless.

17:02.640 --> 17:11.160
It's only meaningful, you know, for political purposes, this whole idea of speaking consensus

17:11.280 --> 17:16.840
to power, that that was some pathway, you know, to policymaking, it hasn't really turned

17:16.840 --> 17:19.840
out to be.

17:19.840 --> 17:24.920
Yeah, so, yeah, there's no consensus, the most recent...

17:24.920 --> 17:32.200
Well, it's also a preposterous claim scientifically, because the way science works is that a great

17:32.200 --> 17:37.040
scientist is the first person who challenges the consensus.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.920
That's kind of how you define a great scientist.

17:39.160 --> 17:43.880
One of the things that's so wonderful about science is that it can reveal when the universal

17:43.880 --> 17:47.000
consensus is wrong.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.440
And it's powerful in its methods precisely because of that.

17:50.440 --> 17:54.280
And you know that as a practicing researcher, is that the probability that you're going

17:54.280 --> 18:01.000
to do a study and that the data is going to reveal the consensus of your lab's theory,

18:01.000 --> 18:05.560
the validity of the consensus of your lab's theory is basically zero.

18:05.640 --> 18:09.640
So, the idea that something unexpected is going to crop up when you actually test your

18:09.640 --> 18:11.640
idea against reality itself.

18:11.640 --> 18:14.640
So, the idea that science is consensus-based is...

18:14.640 --> 18:15.640
It's wrong.

18:15.640 --> 18:16.640
It's wrong.

18:16.640 --> 18:20.640
It's amazing that the idea got anywhere.

18:20.640 --> 18:23.640
Okay, look at the social factors in play.

18:23.640 --> 18:32.640
Okay, there was a big drive by the UN to deal with human, you know, dangerous anthropogenic

18:32.640 --> 18:33.640
climate change.

18:33.720 --> 18:39.720
It was a 1992 treaty before we even had any evidence of human cause warming at all.

18:39.720 --> 18:40.720
Okay?

18:40.720 --> 18:44.920
And then you had scientists become invested in this, you know, in their career goals and

18:44.920 --> 18:49.440
the funding that comes into the field and all of this kind of stuff.

18:49.440 --> 18:55.720
There was this sort of social contract between the scientists and the policy makers that

18:55.720 --> 19:00.000
perpetuated this situation and, you know, and they were...

19:00.000 --> 19:06.080
The policy makers, we need, you know, more, you know, we need more and more confident

19:06.080 --> 19:12.800
statements from the IPCC even though the dimensions of the problem were growing and growing and

19:12.800 --> 19:18.120
growing every year and clearly becoming more complex and obvious that there were a lot

19:18.120 --> 19:20.800
of things that we didn't understand.

19:20.800 --> 19:23.480
But there was this drive, you know.

19:23.480 --> 19:28.360
Well, it's not as if the IPC documents themselves or even that radical.

19:28.360 --> 19:35.560
I mean, my understanding of the IPC documents is that the projection is something like one

19:35.560 --> 19:41.440
to two degrees of further warming with some increase in variability, especially in the

19:41.440 --> 19:47.960
polar regions and a small degree of sea level rise.

19:47.960 --> 19:53.840
No indication in the IPCC reports that this will produce runaway out-of-control feedback

19:53.840 --> 19:58.200
loops that will have a devastating consequence, no real vision of apocalypse.

19:58.240 --> 20:06.400
And so that's not quite correct until, until recently, people were looking at projections

20:06.400 --> 20:12.560
of four to five degrees centigrade more warming over the course of the 21st century.

20:12.560 --> 20:22.000
OK, the issue was wildly ridiculous emissions projections, which are now believed to be

20:22.080 --> 20:24.240
implausible.

20:24.240 --> 20:30.840
The more recent IPCC assessment report with more plausible emissions scenarios is looking

20:30.840 --> 20:36.520
at more two to three degrees centigrade of warming.

20:36.520 --> 20:41.720
And we've already had one degree, so it's an additional one to two degrees centigrade

20:41.720 --> 20:46.000
of warming that people expect based on the climate models.

20:46.000 --> 20:53.520
So they were pretty alarming up until recently because everyone was focused on this extreme

20:53.520 --> 21:01.400
emissions scenario, which is now widely accepted as implausible, if not impossible.

21:01.400 --> 21:06.880
So there was a lot of alarm and all the, you know, when you talk about all the projections

21:06.880 --> 21:12.200
of extreme weather events and we won't be able to grow wine in California and crazy

21:12.200 --> 21:18.000
projections of sea level rise, all these projections were tied to that extreme emissions

21:18.000 --> 21:24.760
scenario and it's taken a community a long time to reject it.

21:24.760 --> 21:30.840
In fact, this extreme emissions scenario was still the most often, the most widely used

21:30.840 --> 21:38.800
in the sixth assessment report, which was published only like two years ago.

21:38.800 --> 21:46.560
So I mean, this is still pervasive, these excessively alarming projections of what could

21:46.560 --> 21:55.560
happen in the 21st century, mostly driven by implausible to impossible emissions scenario,

21:55.560 --> 21:59.360
but also driven by climate models that are running too hot.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.760
Okay, let's go into that a bit.

22:01.760 --> 22:07.640
So I talked to Richard Linsen about a week ago about the problems with models.

22:07.640 --> 22:13.760
He said, for example, that the models are based on cells, let's say, so those would

22:13.760 --> 22:18.640
be, the whole earth can't be modeled, so you have to oversimplify it, you have to clump

22:18.640 --> 22:23.560
it into chunks, and the chunks are about 70 miles wide, they don't, they can't really

22:23.560 --> 22:25.880
model cloud activity very well.

22:25.880 --> 22:30.200
There's a lot of error in relationship to projecting and forecasting the effect of

22:30.200 --> 22:32.240
water vapor.

22:32.240 --> 22:37.000
The models, the models have to build a lot of assumptions in and that doesn't mean that

22:37.080 --> 22:43.960
we shouldn't build models, but it does mean that they have very large potential for error,

22:43.960 --> 22:47.760
and that error is magnified as you project out into the future.

22:47.760 --> 22:53.480
And so I've read, for example, you tell me if you think this is accurate, that our estimates

22:53.480 --> 23:00.340
of the cumulative effect of carbon dioxide on global warming or climate change are smaller

23:00.340 --> 23:05.960
than our estimates of the magnitude of our error in measuring the effect of water vapor.

23:05.960 --> 23:11.320
And that's a big problem because water vapor is a major contributor to warming in principle,

23:11.320 --> 23:16.200
and so if carbon dioxide effects are under the size of the error in that measurement,

23:16.200 --> 23:17.400
that's really well.

23:17.400 --> 23:22.240
Well, I wouldn't put it that way.

23:22.240 --> 23:25.840
We have a pretty good idea of how much water vapor is in the atmosphere.

23:25.840 --> 23:30.080
The question is, how is that going to change with warming?

23:30.080 --> 23:34.480
The bigger issue is the clouds, what clouds are doing.

23:34.480 --> 23:42.880
Clouds have a huge, and they're not modeled very well, and the observational basis for

23:42.880 --> 23:47.880
understanding how they're trending only goes back a few decades.

23:47.880 --> 23:55.280
So that's a tough one, but the net result of these uncertainties in water vapor and

23:55.280 --> 24:02.680
cloud feedback is that we don't know how sensitive the climate is to increasing CO2 because

24:02.680 --> 24:09.520
the way the models treat it is that CO2 and clouds amplify the warming.

24:09.520 --> 24:14.880
And I think the cloud feedback might even be negative.

24:14.880 --> 24:22.040
Water vapor does overall amplify the warming, but in the tropics where Richard Linsen has

24:22.040 --> 24:28.120
done his research, he proposes that there is a negative feedback, and that's something

24:28.120 --> 24:31.880
that's hotly debated, but I think the clouds are the bigger issue.

24:31.880 --> 24:36.880
But apart from what's going on in the atmosphere, to me, it's really the oceans and the sun

24:36.880 --> 24:43.920
that are the biggest sources of uncertainty in terms of understanding what's going on

24:43.920 --> 24:46.880
and be able to project into the future.

24:46.880 --> 24:47.880
So there are...

24:47.880 --> 24:48.880
Okay, why the oceans?

24:48.880 --> 24:49.880
Oh my goodness.

24:49.880 --> 25:00.340
Okay, the oceans have these large circulation systems overturning El Niño, La Niña.

25:00.340 --> 25:01.800
People are familiar with that.

25:01.800 --> 25:05.160
That's a mode of natural internal variability.

25:05.160 --> 25:13.040
There's also decadal and multi-decadal oscillation cycles that change the patterns of clouds,

25:13.040 --> 25:18.480
the whole patterns of sea surface temperature, influence of snowfall on Greenland, the Arctic,

25:18.480 --> 25:24.440
sea ice, rainfall, regional climates, et cetera, and the models don't treat these very well.

25:24.440 --> 25:30.520
There's a whole spectrum of these ocean circulations all on out to 10,000 years.

25:30.520 --> 25:35.120
You have millennial scale overturning that influences the climate.

25:35.120 --> 25:43.440
And the models have far too little power in that part of the spectrum.

25:43.440 --> 25:45.440
So we're just missing that.

25:45.440 --> 25:47.820
And so is that a consequence?

25:47.820 --> 25:54.680
Does that mean that the degree to which the ocean takes up carbon dioxide is permeated

25:54.680 --> 25:56.760
by error in measurement?

25:56.760 --> 26:01.920
Is it also an indication of our lack of understanding of how the temperature of the ocean itself

26:01.920 --> 26:06.280
is regulated by the motion of water from the depths up to the top?

26:06.280 --> 26:07.280
All of that?

26:07.280 --> 26:08.280
Oh, yeah.

26:08.280 --> 26:09.480
Is that where the error is?

26:09.480 --> 26:10.980
Well, no.

26:10.980 --> 26:16.640
Vertical transport of heat and carbon in the ocean is part of the consequences of the uncertainty

26:16.640 --> 26:19.480
in these large-scale circulations.

26:19.480 --> 26:21.920
But more fundamentally, these large-scale...

26:21.920 --> 26:26.480
They change the weather patterns and change the clouds, among other things.

26:26.480 --> 26:33.840
So this is trying to get all that modeled right, let alone making credible predictions

26:33.840 --> 26:34.840
into the future.

26:34.840 --> 26:39.440
We're not there, not even close to being there.

26:39.440 --> 26:45.600
And then once you get into the sun, it's even crazier.

26:45.600 --> 26:54.600
The IPCC has pretty much dismissed the role of the sun in the last 150 years.

26:54.600 --> 27:00.760
But the interesting thing is that in the Six Assessment Report, Chapter 6, they finally

27:00.760 --> 27:06.840
acknowledged the great uncertainty in the amount of solar forcing in the late 20th century.

27:06.840 --> 27:15.240
And this arises from there was a gap in the satellites measuring the sun output that occur

27:15.240 --> 27:22.820
at the time of the Challenger shuttle disaster, if you recall that.

27:22.820 --> 27:27.460
And so one solar sensor was running out, and they were supposed to launch another one,

27:27.460 --> 27:32.740
but all the launches were put off for a number of years until they sorted out what was going

27:32.740 --> 27:36.420
on at NASA with the launches and everything.

27:36.420 --> 27:44.700
So there's this so-called gap, and depending on what was actually happening in that gap,

27:44.700 --> 27:50.260
you can tune the solar variability to high variability or low variability.

27:50.260 --> 27:56.380
So all the climate models are being run with low solar variability forcing, but for the

27:56.380 --> 28:02.900
first time, Chapter 2 in the observational chapter of the Six Assessment Report acknowledged

28:02.900 --> 28:06.660
this issue that there is huge amount of variability.

28:06.660 --> 28:12.180
And this doesn't even factor in the so-called solar indirect effects in terms of there's

28:12.180 --> 28:18.820
a lot of it's not just the heat from the sun, there's a lot of issues related to ultraviolet

28:18.820 --> 28:24.180
and stratosphere and cosmic rays and magnetic fields and all these other things that really

28:24.180 --> 28:25.940
aren't being factored in.

28:25.940 --> 28:29.700
They're at the forefront of research, but they're certainly not factored into the climate

28:29.700 --> 28:30.700
models.

28:30.700 --> 28:39.140
So there are so many uncertainties out there that affect certainly the projections of what

28:39.140 --> 28:45.540
might happen in the 21st century, but also our interpretation of what's been going on

28:45.540 --> 28:54.660
with the climate for the last 100 years ago and exactly what's been causing what.

28:54.660 --> 29:00.380
The current administration's New Year's goals are to tax spend and turn a blind eye to inflation.

29:00.380 --> 29:04.020

30:01.900 --> 30:06.580
So I would say that those who object to the line of reasoning that you're putting forward,

30:06.580 --> 30:09.620
I believe would make an argument analogous to the following.

30:09.620 --> 30:14.980
They would say, well, look, we have, despite all the objections on the measurement front,

30:14.980 --> 30:17.740
we have pretty good evidence that there's a warming trend.

30:17.740 --> 30:22.260
We have reasonable evidence that at least a reasonable proportion of that is a consequence

30:22.260 --> 30:27.020
of anthropogenic activity, most particularly the production of carbon dioxide.

30:27.020 --> 30:33.540
The potential consequence of this could be apocalyptic 100 years down the road or 50

30:33.540 --> 30:35.500
years down the road.

30:35.500 --> 30:40.380
Even with all those doubts in mind, it's incumbent upon us to take something like emergency

30:40.380 --> 30:46.740
action now so that we ameliorate this risk of apocalyptic transformation.

30:46.740 --> 30:51.540
And so this is just obstructionist hand waving your objections.

30:51.540 --> 30:57.540
And if you were moral and on board, you'd see that this issue is so serious and so apocalyptic

30:57.540 --> 31:01.300
that it's inappropriate to stand in the way of the amelioration.

31:01.300 --> 31:04.860
And so what do you think about that as a counter proposition?

31:05.060 --> 31:11.100
OK, the weakest part of their argument is whether all this is dangerous.

31:11.100 --> 31:15.140
The sea level rise is creeping up.

31:15.140 --> 31:24.020
The ice cap, Greenland, Antarctic, it changes from year to year with a little bit of melting,

31:24.020 --> 31:28.020
but there's no catastrophe looming on those fronts.

31:28.020 --> 31:30.580
And so they've turned to extreme weather.

31:30.820 --> 31:32.300
Oh, global warming is calling.

31:32.300 --> 31:37.420
And I have to say, the hurricane and global warming first put this idea into their head.

31:37.420 --> 31:43.740
Ah, you know, if we can show that even one degree can cause something bad, like more

31:43.740 --> 31:47.500
category five hurricanes, then we have something.

31:47.500 --> 31:54.220
So this started this whole trend of every extreme weather event is associated with human

31:54.220 --> 31:57.460
cause global warming, which just isn't true.

31:57.460 --> 32:04.700
And if you look back, and they tend to go back to 1970 or 1950, oh, this is the warmest

32:04.700 --> 32:10.180
year, the worst storm or the biggest drought or whatever since 1970, maybe since 1950.

32:10.180 --> 32:17.420
But if you look into the first half of the 20th century, the weather was way worse, certainly

32:17.420 --> 32:23.500
in North America and over much of the globe also.

32:23.500 --> 32:30.980
Right now in the U.S. West, we're being assaulted by these atmospheric river events, bringing

32:30.980 --> 32:39.460
huge amounts of rain and snow, which is going to cause flooding, it's still snow yet.

32:39.460 --> 32:44.020
And you know, this is horrible, global warming and everything like that.

32:44.020 --> 32:59.220
But if you go back to the winter of 1861 and 1862, 15 inches of rain fell in central California

32:59.220 --> 33:05.420
over a period of a couple of months, which huge floods over a very widespread area that

33:05.420 --> 33:08.420
lasted for absolute months.

33:08.420 --> 33:14.780
And paleo climate evidence showed that these tend to happen about every 200 years or so,

33:14.780 --> 33:18.940
where you have this massive accumulation of these atmospheric rivers.

33:18.940 --> 33:21.780
So this is nothing at all unusual.

33:21.780 --> 33:27.540
So if you look back into the historical record or better yet, the paleo climate record, invariably

33:27.540 --> 33:30.660
you will find worse weather events.

33:30.660 --> 33:36.060
So that's part of the timeframe problem, right, is like, well, over what span do you evaluate

33:36.060 --> 33:38.500
these events before you draw your conclusions?

33:38.500 --> 33:39.500
But you can't...

33:39.500 --> 33:40.700
So do you believe it?

33:40.700 --> 33:46.780
Do you believe that any of the tipping point hypotheses, Franzen told me something interesting.

33:46.780 --> 33:49.260
This was kind of a technical proposition.

33:49.260 --> 33:54.900
He said that in complex systems with many degrees of freedom on the entropy front, so many ways

33:54.900 --> 34:01.460
they can potentially react, the probability of a tipping point positive feedback loop,

34:01.460 --> 34:05.700
you know, like the runaway global warming or something like that, the melting of the

34:05.700 --> 34:11.340
Greenland ice caps, because we hit a tipping point, said in complex systems that have multiple

34:11.340 --> 34:16.540
potential outcomes, that kind of all or none tipping point is unlikely.

34:16.540 --> 34:21.340
You get that more likely in a simple system that's characterized by the probability of

34:21.340 --> 34:24.820
radical state change, like water freezing, for example.

34:24.820 --> 34:29.140
And so I thought that I can't evaluate that argument, you know, it's outside my domain

34:29.140 --> 34:33.700
of scientific competence, but it struck me as an interesting idea.

34:33.700 --> 34:42.140
Well, to some extent, it's true, there is one sort of tipping point that we could encounter,

34:42.140 --> 34:48.120
and if this does happen, I would expect that human-caused global warming would play only

34:48.120 --> 34:54.660
a small part, and this is the West Antarctic ice sheet, which is an unstable ice sheet.

34:54.660 --> 34:58.900
So if you took the ice sheet away, the continent would actually be under water.

34:58.900 --> 35:04.500
But what it is, you have this huge ice sheet that sits on the continent and part of it's

35:04.500 --> 35:09.220
above water, okay, and it has an overhang.

35:09.220 --> 35:16.820
And this is just a dynamically unstable situation, and it moves fairly fast.

35:16.820 --> 35:24.780
Underneath this ice sheet are lots of inactive volcanoes, even the occasional active volcanoes.

35:24.780 --> 35:29.940
So if these volcanoes became active and we had, you know, a greater heat source under

35:29.940 --> 35:39.100
this, combined with sea level rise and a little bit of global warming, this could accelerate.

35:39.100 --> 35:45.020
And on the time scale of, you know, three or four centuries, we could see this collapse,

35:45.020 --> 35:49.220
you know, which could lead to a substantial sea level rise.

35:49.220 --> 35:54.460
So that's the one kind, you know, if we saw that happening, are there engineering ways

35:54.460 --> 35:56.060
of dealing with it?

35:56.060 --> 36:02.060
I don't know, but it was something that would be a slow process, but that's the only one

36:02.060 --> 36:10.380
of the so-called tipping points that I see could happen, because, you know, if there's

36:10.380 --> 36:15.820
going to be some solid earth, you know, if the earth wants to have an earthquake or big

36:15.820 --> 36:20.780
volcanic eruption, you know, there aren't a lot of, you know, negative feedbacks in

36:20.780 --> 36:22.780
the earth system to prevent that.

36:22.780 --> 36:30.860
So to me, that's the one, like, bad thing that could happen, but it would take centuries.

36:30.860 --> 36:35.060
But the other ones, you know, I don't see it.

36:35.060 --> 36:40.700
So what do you think, when you look at the IPCC reports now and you look 50 years ahead

36:40.700 --> 36:48.140
or 100 years ahead, what would you regard as a credible representation of the so-called

36:48.140 --> 36:50.540
climate science?

36:50.540 --> 36:56.700
Do you accept the new IPC prognostications, or do you think the models are so error-ridden

36:56.700 --> 37:02.740
that even the hypothesis of one to two degrees warming isn't reliable enough, even though

37:02.740 --> 37:03.940
it's the best we have?

37:04.220 --> 37:11.180
Well, the interesting thing is that the IPCC Six Assessment Report, Working Group One,

37:11.180 --> 37:15.660
they also sort of rejected the climate models to some extent.

37:15.660 --> 37:21.580
They were guided by them in their projections, but they also, you know, defined a plausible

37:21.580 --> 37:25.980
range of climate sensitivity and looked at the projections from there.

37:25.980 --> 37:31.500
So even the IPCC is stepping back from the global climate models as being useful for

37:31.500 --> 37:37.220
projections, and people are going to these climate emulators, these simple climate models.

37:37.220 --> 37:43.340
Well, for this amount of warming, you know, run it through a damage model or an economic

37:43.340 --> 37:45.380
assessment model or something like that.

37:45.380 --> 37:49.500
So people are really stepping back from these big global climate models, and it's about

37:49.500 --> 37:51.020
time.

37:51.020 --> 37:59.340
And one of the innovations that I've been undertaking in my projection work, and this

37:59.340 --> 38:06.100
is what I do for clients of my company, Climate Forecast Applications Network, is that I

38:06.100 --> 38:07.260
look at it.

38:07.260 --> 38:13.500
I don't just look at the IPCC scenarios, and I choose the low-end ones, because I think

38:13.500 --> 38:18.260
those are more credible, but I also look at scenarios of what the ocean circulations

38:18.260 --> 38:26.180
could be doing, you know, scenarios of volcanic eruptions and solar variation scenarios and

38:26.180 --> 38:31.980
try to put forward a broader range of what we might be looking at.

38:31.980 --> 38:37.900
And so I have like a network-based approach to combine all this and to producing a much

38:37.900 --> 38:40.060
broader range of scenarios.

38:40.060 --> 38:45.700
And at least over the next three decades, like the natural variability piece of this

38:45.700 --> 38:52.260
is pointing towards cooling rather than amplifying the warming, you know, it would tamp down

38:52.260 --> 38:58.220
the global warming of whatever magnitude it is from fossil fuel emissions.

38:58.220 --> 39:00.380
So that's the approach that I'm taking.

39:00.380 --> 39:02.540
Okay, so let's go into that a bit.

39:02.540 --> 39:11.060
You earlier, you indicated that you left the university in 2017 to pursue an entrepreneurial

39:11.060 --> 39:18.260
activity that you had initiated at Georgia Tech, and you just made allusion to that again.

39:18.260 --> 39:26.220
So tell me, if you would, how you are modeling, and you've laid out some of the conclusions,

39:26.220 --> 39:28.980
but who's interested in your models?

39:28.980 --> 39:33.300
And obviously, you're doing this on an entrepreneurial basis, so people are willing to pay you for

39:33.300 --> 39:38.660
your opinion, which gives, I think, some, what would you say, indication of their faith

39:38.660 --> 39:44.500
in its credibility, because people are actually spending money on it, like how are your models

39:44.500 --> 39:50.460
different than the models that are more broadly publicized, let's say?

39:50.460 --> 39:54.180
And who is it that is paying you to produce these models?

39:54.180 --> 39:55.700
Why is there interest in that?

39:55.700 --> 39:57.180
And why are they doing it?

39:57.180 --> 40:04.620
Okay, well, insurance companies, financial institutions have an interest in Atlantic

40:04.620 --> 40:06.120
hurricanes.

40:06.120 --> 40:11.340
What are we looking at over the next three decades in terms of Atlantic hurricane activity?

40:11.340 --> 40:17.660
A big issue is a potential shift to the cold phase of the Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation.

40:17.660 --> 40:24.540
This is one of those multi-decadal oscillations that I talked about, which we would expect

40:24.540 --> 40:29.700
would start to tamp down the Atlantic hurricane activity.

40:29.700 --> 40:31.780
So this is a very big deal for them.

40:31.780 --> 40:39.860
Another client was Wind Farm owners who wanted to know, is the wind going to keep blowing

40:39.860 --> 40:43.460
for the next 30 years, and are my wind farms in the right location?

40:43.460 --> 40:46.780
Okay, they wanted to know that.

40:46.780 --> 40:54.580
Some electric utilities want to know, what could we be looking at in terms of, like,

40:54.580 --> 41:02.180
how frequent these really bad situations could be for renewable power, like a massive cold

41:02.180 --> 41:07.060
air outbreak that lasts for weeks, the wind doesn't blow, and it's wintertime and there's

41:07.060 --> 41:08.780
no sun.

41:08.780 --> 41:13.700
How bad can it get, and how frequently might these occur?

41:13.700 --> 41:19.380
So these are some of the things that I've been looking at, and also people interested

41:19.380 --> 41:27.940
in sea level rise projections in their particular location, looking at scenarios of what their

41:27.940 --> 41:28.940
location.

41:28.940 --> 41:37.380
A lot of interest from people in Florida, San Francisco, along the Atlantic coast.

41:37.380 --> 41:39.260
What could we be looking at?

41:39.260 --> 41:46.740
We see that those projections from the IPCC, which of those should we believe, but we already

41:46.740 --> 41:52.140
know that, you know, how are the ocean circulation patterns going to influence their local sea

41:52.140 --> 41:53.860
level rise?

41:53.860 --> 42:06.420
What kind of trends do I see for the vertical land motion, both from local effects and large

42:07.420 --> 42:12.700
more planetary scale up and down, kind of effects.

42:12.700 --> 42:17.980
So those are some of the projects that I've been working on, looking at scenarios out,

42:17.980 --> 42:22.260
say, 30 to 50 years.

42:22.260 --> 42:26.980
If you own a small to medium-sized business that kept employees on payroll through COVID,

42:26.980 --> 42:29.900
you may have a big cash refund waiting for you.

42:29.900 --> 42:35.300

43:25.220 --> 43:30.020
So why do these companies believe that your models are credible enough for them to pour

43:30.020 --> 43:35.100
economic resources into, and why do you believe that your models are credible enough to provide

43:35.100 --> 43:36.100
them with accurate guidance?

43:36.100 --> 43:40.940
I mean, we talked about some of the limitations of models, and so what is it that you're doing

43:40.940 --> 43:46.060
that is credible to the companies, and why do you believe scientifically that you're

43:46.060 --> 43:47.740
providing accurate information?

43:47.740 --> 43:48.740
Okay.

43:48.740 --> 43:56.660
The first thing that I did, and I did this before most other people did, I said, look,

43:56.660 --> 44:01.500
you're wasting your time looking at that extreme emissions scenario.

44:01.500 --> 44:10.380
If you look at the international energy agency, their scenarios show emissions being fairly

44:10.380 --> 44:17.700
flat for the next several decades, and I think this is a much more plausible scenario.

44:17.700 --> 44:24.080
So let's focus on that one, and this is apart from trying to predict what policy is going

44:24.080 --> 44:29.400
to do and how much you're going to change, but the thinking is now that emissions are

44:29.400 --> 44:36.240
going to stay fairly flat for the next few decades, and I saw this, and I saw the journal

44:36.240 --> 44:39.560
publications, and this is what I was pushing to my client.

44:39.560 --> 44:43.760
If you want something realistic, this is what you should be looking at.

44:43.760 --> 44:55.480
The other thing is not accepting the extremely high values of climate sensitivity to CO2

44:55.480 --> 44:56.480
doubling.

44:56.480 --> 45:02.880
I don't go as low as Richard Linsen does, but I'm certainly on the low end, and I justify

45:02.880 --> 45:09.600
why to them, based on publications, including some of my own, why we shouldn't be looking

45:09.600 --> 45:13.360
at these very high sensitivity values.

45:13.480 --> 45:20.120
I run it through a range so they can look, but I'm saying, so I give them all the scenarios

45:20.120 --> 45:21.120
they want.

45:21.120 --> 45:27.720
I'll give the high emission scenario, I'll give the high climate sensitivity, low climate

45:27.720 --> 45:35.200
sensitivity, I'll say my best judgment is that this is what it is, but then I uniquely

45:35.200 --> 45:40.920
put in scenarios of the natural variability, and they really like this.

45:40.920 --> 45:47.880
They get it, they've seen it, and they understand it's out there, they've just never seen anybody

45:47.880 --> 45:52.080
try to project it before, and I have publications on this.

45:52.080 --> 45:56.640
They can parameterize their risk given your plethora of models.

45:56.640 --> 46:03.120
Here's the worst case scenario, here's the likely scenario, here's the range, and then

46:03.120 --> 46:09.640
they can calculate how to mitigate their risk across those scenarios.

46:09.640 --> 46:10.640
Exactly.

46:10.880 --> 46:13.920
A lot of times they want to know, well, what's the worst case?

46:13.920 --> 46:15.920
What's the worst plausible case?

46:15.920 --> 46:22.520
Okay, and so I give them that, and so they have this whole range, okay, so for example,

46:22.520 --> 46:30.040
in the wind farm profitability study, I gave them 81 scenarios, different scenarios of

46:30.040 --> 46:39.480
how this could play out over the next 30 years, and there was a cluster of scenarios in a

46:39.480 --> 46:46.800
certain area, and I say, you might infer that these are the most plausible outcomes

46:46.800 --> 46:53.920
because there's multiple different pathways for reaching that, but here's your plausible

46:53.920 --> 47:01.880
worst case, here's your plausible best case, and this gives them some information for making

47:01.880 --> 47:05.640
their decision.

47:05.640 --> 47:12.400
So you admit right up front in some sense that there are inputs into your models that

47:12.400 --> 47:18.280
are somewhat arbitrary, that you have to decide about, and those might be, for example, your

47:18.280 --> 47:25.560
projections of carbon dioxide output, and then you say, given a variety of initial assumptions,

47:25.560 --> 47:31.800
here's a variety of outcomes, but a lot of the models tend to converge at this vision,

47:31.800 --> 47:36.680
this range of visions, and so if the convergence of multiple models constitutes evidence, which

47:36.680 --> 47:42.080
we generally assume it does, then this seems to be the most plausible pathway, right, and

47:42.080 --> 47:44.960
so how does that differ from the IPCC approach?

47:44.960 --> 47:50.320
Okay, well, I don't say it's the more, well, first they neglect all the elements of natural

47:50.320 --> 47:55.920
variability that I conclude, they're not giving scenarios of volcanic eruptions, they're not

47:55.920 --> 48:10.160
giving different scenarios of sun activity, they have a bunch of different scenarios of

48:10.160 --> 48:16.680
what the internal ocean variability is doing, but I can anchor it more closely to what the

48:16.680 --> 48:22.920
observations are in my own network model in terms of what the plausible trajectories are,

48:22.920 --> 48:33.560
so I'm giving them a more plausible trajectory for the ocean oscillations, and generally,

48:33.560 --> 48:40.480
going out 30 years, these other scenarios are cooler than the IPCC scenarios.

48:40.480 --> 48:48.200
Well, and so, and do they actually point to cooling or just less rapid warming?

48:48.200 --> 48:53.440
Some of them go as far as cooling, okay, and others are less rapid warming, and there've

48:53.440 --> 48:59.920
been another publications, you never see them publicize, that show for certain combinations

48:59.920 --> 49:07.800
of these ocean circulations or volcanic eruptions or solar activity that you could see cooling

49:07.800 --> 49:14.600
for a decade or two during the 21st century, that could happen.

49:14.600 --> 49:21.640
When the IPCC AR6 did, if you read the fine print deep in the chapters, you'll see these

49:21.640 --> 49:30.200
papers referenced and it is acknowledged, but it's not something that you hear in the

49:30.200 --> 49:35.000
public debate, it's just this relentless warming that we're going to be seeing.

49:35.000 --> 49:43.240
Okay, so that's interesting because the warming advocates are doubtful enough about their

49:43.240 --> 49:49.000
own prognostication so that it's no longer appropriate to refer to global warming, you're

49:49.000 --> 49:54.480
supposed to refer to climate change, which I think is a terrible sleight of hand, but

49:54.480 --> 49:56.480
in any case, that's what's happened.

49:56.480 --> 50:02.880
But nonetheless, the apocalyptic prognostications are still predicated on this idea of warming.

50:02.880 --> 50:08.440
Now your claim is that the consensus that that might be apocalyptic was never there to

50:08.440 --> 50:13.720
begin with and the initial estimates of the magnitude of warming were out by about a factor

50:13.720 --> 50:20.760
of two, partly because people accepted equally apocalyptic in some sense prognostications

50:20.760 --> 50:23.280
of carbon dioxide output.

50:23.280 --> 50:29.880
But then you're taking that further, you're saying that the models are so prone to variability

50:29.880 --> 50:35.720
that there is some non-trivial possibility that there'll be a global cooling trend over

50:35.720 --> 50:38.520
the next 30 years instead of a global warming trend.

50:38.520 --> 50:44.960
And so in the face of all that, someone might ask themselves, well, if the situation with

50:44.960 --> 50:53.040
regards to these models is as uncertain as you suggest, and also it's interesting just

50:53.040 --> 50:57.800
as soon as I decide that financial companies will pay you for your prognostications, which

50:57.800 --> 51:04.560
is another form of validation of your opinion, why in the world are we stampeding madly to

51:04.560 --> 51:10.480
spend untold, literally trillions of dollars trying to ameliorate a problem that we haven't

51:10.480 --> 51:12.160
properly measured?

51:12.160 --> 51:14.720
Like what's going on here as far as you can tell?

51:14.720 --> 51:15.720
Okay.

51:15.720 --> 51:16.720
You have to go back.

51:16.720 --> 51:17.720
Okay.

51:17.720 --> 51:25.880
The policy cart has been way out in front of the scientific course from the very beginning.

51:25.880 --> 51:33.000
In the 1980s, the UN environmental program was looking for something.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.160
We hate capitalism.

51:34.160 --> 51:35.880
We don't like the oil companies.

51:35.880 --> 51:39.000
We like world government, all this kind of thing.

51:39.000 --> 51:47.320
And they latched on to the climate change, the CO2 global warming is what it was called

51:47.320 --> 51:48.320
back then.

51:48.320 --> 51:54.760
And this ceded the formation of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

51:54.760 --> 52:01.720
And there was a treaty signed by 192 nations in 1992, including the US.

52:01.720 --> 52:03.760
This was before we knew anything.

52:03.760 --> 52:11.300
We were to avoid dangerous anthropogenic climate change before we had any idea of any of this.

52:11.300 --> 52:20.360
And so this frame, the climate problem, in a very narrow frame, a lot of climate is now

52:20.360 --> 52:25.120
caused by CO2 and by definition warming is dangerous.

52:25.120 --> 52:28.400
Why was that such an attractive political hypothesis?

52:28.400 --> 52:35.160
Why did politicians decide that in the absence of this stringently produced scientific evidence

52:35.160 --> 52:41.200
that the proper place for the world's political community to focus was on the cardinal danger

52:41.200 --> 52:44.320
of global warming that was anthropogenically produced?

52:44.320 --> 52:48.360
Like, what the hell is going on there, especially because it's so expensive?

52:48.360 --> 52:49.360
Okay.

52:49.360 --> 52:51.800
Well, people didn't pay much attention to it for decades.

52:51.800 --> 52:57.800
I mean, the Kyoto Protocol, a bunch of countries in 1997, a bunch of countries signed on to

52:57.800 --> 52:59.640
reduce their emissions.

52:59.640 --> 53:04.040
But even the ones who signed on didn't really reduce their emissions, and of course the US

53:04.040 --> 53:05.440
never signed on.

53:05.440 --> 53:08.200
And reduced its emissions weirdly enough.

53:08.200 --> 53:09.440
So that's pretty funny.

53:09.440 --> 53:10.760
I know.

53:10.760 --> 53:17.800
And it wasn't really until the Paris Agreement that they came up with this more voluntary

53:17.800 --> 53:19.320
thing.

53:19.400 --> 53:26.240
Then they started phrasing it, and there was a spate of bad weather, big El Nino and stuff

53:26.240 --> 53:33.680
like that, that they latched onto this extreme, if we'd just got rid of all this, the weather

53:33.680 --> 53:34.680
would be nicer.

53:34.680 --> 53:40.160
We'd get rid of all these floods and droughts and hurricanes and whatever else and heatwaves

53:40.160 --> 53:42.720
that was plaguing humanity.

53:42.720 --> 53:47.440
And so people bought that kind of simple argument.

53:47.440 --> 53:53.600
And then once, there was a real shift in 2018.

53:53.600 --> 54:00.640
After the Paris Agreement, the rhetoric was climate crisis, climate emergency from the

54:00.640 --> 54:08.240
world leaders, the UN, President Obama, Macron, Merkel, all of these leaders saying this.

54:08.240 --> 54:12.600
But in 2018, people started paying attention.

54:12.600 --> 54:23.200
And this is when Gretta Thunberg came onto the scene, and she's a remarkable person.

54:23.200 --> 54:28.520
She's wrong, a lot of things, but a remarkable person nevertheless.

54:28.520 --> 54:34.360
But what she was doing spawned the sunrise movement, extinction, rebellion, all this

54:34.360 --> 54:35.960
kind of stuff.

54:35.960 --> 54:42.640
And the journalists amplified this, the climate crisis, the climate emergency.

54:42.640 --> 54:48.880
Ten years ago, climate, even ten years ago, climate change was like really a fringe topic.

54:48.880 --> 54:53.600
At journals, now major media outlets have a climate desk, you know, I have a whole team

54:53.600 --> 55:02.800
of journalists and there's huge money going into things like carbon brief, things that

55:02.800 --> 55:05.360
focus specifically on climate change.

55:05.360 --> 55:08.200
And so it's just exploded.

55:08.200 --> 55:13.240
And again, there's this social contract between the policy makers, the media and the scientists.

55:13.240 --> 55:16.000
It's great for the science, there's nobody.

55:16.000 --> 55:21.560
Ten years ago, people with a PhD in climate science, you know, would be trying to get

55:21.560 --> 55:23.880
a postdoc and whatever.

55:23.880 --> 55:26.320
And now the universities can't even hang onto them.

55:26.320 --> 55:30.440
There's so many jobs in the media and the private sector that, you know, this is just

55:30.440 --> 55:31.840
a hot thing.

55:31.840 --> 55:38.560
Every university now has some sort of climate-y department, institute.

55:38.560 --> 55:40.240
It's just big business for everybody.

55:40.240 --> 55:46.240
And so there's this mutual reinforcement between the scientists, the policy makers and the media.

55:46.240 --> 55:49.800
So that's where the positive feedback loops are, from the tipping point.

55:49.800 --> 55:52.120
Right, they're on the sociological side.

55:52.120 --> 55:53.680
Yeah, definitely, definitely.

55:53.680 --> 55:56.200
Yeah, well, it's quite something to behold.

55:56.200 --> 56:00.240
So now what has been the consequences?

56:00.240 --> 56:04.680
I mean, you've been pilloried, I believe, I don't believe I'm overstating this, you've

56:04.680 --> 56:10.480
been pilloried or satirized as a sort of fringe figure on the client denial front.

56:10.480 --> 56:12.560
I think that's fair to say.

56:12.560 --> 56:18.600
And it's pretty easy to smear someone with tactics like that, and it's psychologically

56:18.600 --> 56:19.600
very effective.

56:19.600 --> 56:25.280
I mean, what has it, you know, you said you rose to public prominence partly because you

56:25.280 --> 56:30.720
formulated an argument, at least to begin with, that could be latched onto by the climate

56:30.720 --> 56:33.520
apocalypse, and quite effectively.

56:33.520 --> 56:41.600
But then you produced all sorts of other material, mitigating, producing a mitigated view.

56:41.600 --> 56:45.600
What's been the consequence for you of being involved in this?

56:45.600 --> 56:51.200
Okay, let me tell you what my sin was.

56:51.200 --> 56:53.640
People don't object to my science.

56:53.640 --> 57:00.360
I mean, I'm within, you know, the likely range of the IPCC for the most part on the

57:00.360 --> 57:01.360
low end.

57:01.360 --> 57:08.240
But, you know, it's not fringe perspectives, and I commonly cite the IPCC.

57:08.240 --> 57:15.120
What happened, the reason I was shuffled off into denier camp is because I criticized

57:15.120 --> 57:18.320
the behavior of climate scientists.

57:18.320 --> 57:26.160
I criticized the IPCC for some ethical violations, as well as not paying enough attention to

57:26.160 --> 57:27.160
uncertainty.

57:27.160 --> 57:29.880
So that was my sin, okay?

57:29.880 --> 57:35.560
I offended and criticized the grand poobahs of the climate community.

57:35.560 --> 57:43.720
And then I was very quick, and most importantly, in 2011, I criticized Michael Mann's hockey

57:43.720 --> 57:50.200
stick on my blog, and then he started calling me a denier, and that was really the beginning

57:50.200 --> 57:51.200
of the end.

57:51.200 --> 57:52.200
So my sin...

57:52.200 --> 57:55.840
Yeah, so let's talk about that terminology for a second, just so everybody knows.

57:55.840 --> 58:02.240
So this is quite the rhetorical move on the part of the climate purveyors of apocalyptic

58:02.240 --> 58:03.240
doom.

58:03.240 --> 58:08.840
And so we already established in our society, broadly speaking in the West, that to object

58:08.840 --> 58:14.160
to the idea that the Holocaust was a historical reality puts you outside the pale of normative

58:14.160 --> 58:16.760
and reasonable political discussion.

58:16.760 --> 58:21.800
And so you can be a Holocaust denier, and if you are such a creature, then you're lumped

58:21.800 --> 58:26.560
in with the Nazis and put on the shelf for no further contact, right?

58:26.560 --> 58:28.800
You've entered the realm of the reprehensible.

58:28.800 --> 58:33.440
Now one of the most effective rhetorical moves of the people who are making a great living

58:33.560 --> 58:39.320
or putting themselves forward morally as climate apocalyptic doomsayers was to target

58:39.320 --> 58:44.680
people who objected to their views with terminology that was derived directly from that rhetorical

58:44.680 --> 58:45.680
move.

58:45.680 --> 58:51.080
So now if you're a climate change denier, the connotation is you're occupied the same

58:51.080 --> 58:57.240
category morally as people who refuse to believe on the grounds of their appalling anti-Semitism

58:57.240 --> 59:02.200
and their blind historical ignorance that the Holocaust was a historical reality.

59:02.200 --> 59:07.040
And so in some sense, there's no real difference between labeling someone a climate change

59:07.040 --> 59:10.880
denier and labeling them a Nazi enabler.

59:10.880 --> 59:14.360
And the rhetorical move was designed precisely to produce that outcome.

59:14.360 --> 59:17.120
And so I'm not a big fan of that kind of rhetorical move.

59:17.120 --> 59:21.200
And let's talk about Michael Mann for a second too now, because a lot of people listening

59:21.200 --> 59:24.720
and watching, they're not going to know what that hockey stick graph was.

59:24.720 --> 59:30.200
And they don't know what cardinal role, the scandal around that graph has produced in

59:30.200 --> 59:31.200
the discussion.

59:31.200 --> 59:33.760
Do you want to walk through the hockey stick graph a little bit?

59:33.760 --> 59:34.760
Okay.

59:34.760 --> 59:43.440
If you go back to 2001, this was the release of the third assessment report from the IPCC.

59:43.440 --> 59:49.320
And Sir John Houghton, who was the head of the IPCC, was giving the press release.

59:49.320 --> 59:56.920
And the backdrop behind him was this image, a curve that looked like a hockey stick, which

59:56.920 --> 01:00:02.760
was meant to portray that the climate was very stable for the last thousand years.

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:10.840
And all of a sudden, you've got this big uptick that is caused by humans.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:16.640
And this was based on the work of Michael Mann, who was a recent PhD.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:19.520
This was his postdoc work.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:27.200
Before the ink was dry on his PhD, he was appointed a lead author of the IPCC, which

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:31.200
was a fairly unusual move to appoint someone.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.400
That's an insane move.

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:35.760
Let me let everybody watching and listening know.

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:42.840
Your PhD is putting your foot or your toe in the water of scientific endeavor.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:50.320
So Judith has 190 publications, and just so those of you who are listening know, generally

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:55.920
speaking, a PhD thesis requires approximately as much work as three scientific publications

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.600
if it's a high quality PhD.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:05.600
And so when you get your PhD, you've entered the domain of genuine scientific contribution.

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.720
The PhD is actually a marker of that.

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:13.080
And if you do a postdoc, that means that you have the opportunity to do a little bit more

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:18.200
research work to establish your credibility now as a more independent researcher who isn't

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.960
dependent on the ideas of your supervisor.

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:22.080
So you're a neophyte.

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.960
You're a beginner when you do a PhD and a postdoc.

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:29.280
And maybe you have to do one or maybe two, and then maybe you can get hired as a junior

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.280
professor.

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:32.320
But you're by no means at the peak of your career.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:38.640
And it's very, very rare for initiatory research that might be done at the PhD level to be

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:45.240
regarded as canonical unless you're a Nobel Prize-winning genius by the scientific community.

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:50.000
And so the fact that man's work got so much attention, even though it was done at this

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.480
initial level of scientific investigation, I mean, that doesn't speak to its validity.

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:57.880
But my point is it's an aberration in the process.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:01.000
And it also points to this problem we discussed earlier of timeframe.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.640
I mean, when you construct graphs, you can play with their psychological impact in all

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.440
sorts of inappropriate ways.

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:11.320
You can expand and contract the timeframe.

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:14.920
You can expand and contract the scale on the left.

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:20.400
And you can make what's really a small effect across some historical span of time look big

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:23.680
by playing with the scale.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:29.120
And you can make an effect that isn't very large, temporally speaking, by shrinking the

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:30.720
timescale of evaluation.

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:38.520
So the man's graph showed this uptick in climate transformation that was attendant on human

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:39.960
industrial activity.

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:46.600
But he picked a very narrow timeframe and a very particularized scale so that this maximized

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:49.320
the psychological impact of the graph.

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:52.080
And so, but that does bring us to this problem of timescale.

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.600
It's like, well, and variability.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:58.000
How much has things changed over 10,000 years?

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.560
Like what's the right timescale here?

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:01.200
And that's a very difficult problem.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:13.080
Well, the issues of the hockey stick were not so much that the trigger, the hockey stick

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:17.400
trigger, the important one is around 2000.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:24.240
Right after that, this was viewed by a mining engineer, Steve McIntyre said, hockey stick,

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:26.080
hockey stick, I've seen these things.

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:29.800
This is usually a con game trying to get somebody to buy mining stocks.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:33.680
He says, you know, then he got intrigued, he wanted to look at the data.

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.440
So he asked for the data, they gave him some of it.

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:44.960
And he and Ross McKittrick, Canadian economics professor, took a look at this and they found

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:50.840
all sorts of errors, you know, mishandling of data, inappropriate statistical methods

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:52.600
on and on it goes.

01:03:52.600 --> 01:04:00.440
And man went after these guys big time rather than, you know, constructively trying to deal

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.960
with these criticisms.

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:08.360
He went after these guys and this turned into a pretty big flame war.

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:13.840
And then McIntyre and McKittrick published two additional papers in 2005.

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:17.560
And the controversy, you know, was just explosive.

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:21.880
There were congressional hearings on this and on and on it went.

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:25.280
So it was this huge controversy.

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:34.080
And these Climategate emails that were released in 2009 revealed all sorts of skull-dudgery,

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:42.040
you know, trying to keep data away from McIntyre and McKittrick, trying to put pressure on

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:46.960
journal editors not to publish their papers and on and on it goes.

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:52.760
And, you know, and so this was revealed in Climategate.

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:57.360
So those were more egregious sins than just picking a convenient timeframe and a convenient

01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:58.360
scale.

01:04:58.360 --> 01:04:59.360
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:06.560
But there is a graphical issue and this was the theme of my blog post, Hiding the Decline.

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:11.440
So the Paleo climate record just, you know, showed these little oscillations and to get

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:20.120
that sort of hockey stick piece, they spliced on the observational record on top of that.

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:25.680
And it wasn't clear in the IPCC report that was that was done.

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:31.200
It was sort of in some sort of a footnote or an obscure reference, but it never occurred

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:35.680
to me as someone in the field that this is what had been done.

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.480
So no, I don't understand that.

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:38.480
Go into that more detail.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:41.160
I don't understand exactly what was done there.

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:42.160
Okay.

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:43.160
You see the handle?

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.160
Okay.

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:49.920
If you look at the actual tree ring rate data that went into their analysis, it was just

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:53.000
like the flat handle.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:00.720
In order to get the blade, the uptick of the blade, they spliced on the historical temperature

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:03.480
record, completely different data set.

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:05.320
Oh, oh, I see.

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:10.040
Because the tree rings weren't showing this uptick.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:14.280
This is a so-called hide the decline.

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:21.800
And so, you know, to me, this is something without doing that is a bad idea, but doing

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:30.920
that without explaining it is marginal and this is known in some circles subsequently

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:34.240
would be given a label as image fraud.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:40.560
And so this is what I wrote my blog post about and I wasn't particularly attacking man because

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:49.720
he wasn't the only person involved in this little deception, but, you know, this got

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:56.080
a lot of attention and apparently Michael Mann was unhappy and pretty soon after that,

01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:00.280
you know, he was calling me a denier on Twitter and then I started appearing on all these

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:10.040
misinformer lists and by 2012, you know, I was firmly established as a denier and the

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:17.560
society of environmental journalists put together a list, a description of all the climate blogs.

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:24.480
And my blog was under the list of denier blogs and the description says, unlike most other

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:27.400
denier blogs, Currie is a real scientist.

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:34.360
She looks at both sides of the issues, digs deep into the issues, discusses the uncertainties

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:38.960
and all this other stuff and I said, well, that's a beautiful description of my blog,

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:44.040
but why did they accept prima facie that my blog is a denier blog?

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:49.280
I mean, it just shows how pervasive and how stupid this whole thing was.

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:52.840
So I, you know, I got tossed into the denier camp.

01:07:52.840 --> 01:08:03.040
I don't align myself with either side, you know, I, I, I preciously fought for my independence,

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:06.400
which included resigning my academic position.

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:13.520
So you know, I think for myself, I think deep, I look at the evidence, make judgments.

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:19.080
And it's mostly about trying to better characterize uncertainties and what we don't know.

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:25.400
This is a key part of rational policymaking is to understand the uncertainties and what

01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:28.600
we don't know.

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:30.440
We'll be back in one moment.

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:34.880
First we wanted to give you a sneak peek at Jordan's new series, Exodus.

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:44.760
So the Hebrews created history as we know it.

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:46.320
You don't get away with anything.

01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:49.920
And so you might think you can bend the fabric of reality and that you can treat people

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:53.760
instrumentally and that you can bow to the tyrant and violate your conscience without

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:54.760
cost.

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:55.760
You will pay the piper.

01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:00.120
It's going to call you out of that slavery into freedom, even if that pulls you into

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:01.120
the desert.

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:09.000
And we're going to see that there's something else going on here that is far more cosmic

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.480
and deeper than what you can imagine.

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:19.760
The highest ethical spirit to which we're beholden is presented precisely as that spirit

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:24.000
that allies itself with the cause of freedom against tyranny.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Yes, it's that hope.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
And there is that hope.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
I want villains to get punished.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.280
But do you want the villains to learn before they have to pay the ultimate price?

01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:31.680
That's such a Christian question.

01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:48.240
Well, we've got a threefold problem here by the sounds of things in some real sense.

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:53.560
I mean, the first problem is kind of a positive feedback loop that you alluded to, is that

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:56.880
a lot of attention was paid to this potential issue.

01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:00.880
A lot of money was put into funding investigation into it.

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:05.800
That incentivized the growth of a huge scientific enterprise.

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:10.520
That incentivized people who were primarily motivated by the money, including the grants.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:15.080
And I mean, it's hard not to be motivated by that if you want to be a practicing scientist.

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:22.240
And so there was a lot of financial and practical pressure to produce an environmentally apocalyptic

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:23.560
story.

01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:28.560
And then you could imagine that it's amplified by the fact that reporting that there's no

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:33.160
problem on the climate front is not something that's going to produce an attention grabbing

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:41.600
headline, especially in the era of declining attention being paid to legacy media outlets.

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:46.720
And so we know perfectly well that human beings are much more sensitive to negative information

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:52.720
comparatively speaking than to positive information and that you can attract attention with a story

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:57.520
of gloom and threat much more effectively than one that states there's no story here

01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:59.960
at all or something positive.

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:00.960
So that's a big problem.

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:07.360
And then the third problem I would say is that it's easy for venal and narcissistic politicians,

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:14.760
and that's not all of them, to latch on to a convenient money generating apocalyptic nightmare

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:20.200
to put themselves forward as white knights on the moral front and to pull the wool over

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:24.240
the eyes and maybe even their own eyes in relationship to whether or not they're making

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:26.680
any practical progress in the actual world.

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:33.480
And so there is a situation where we have a set of positive feedback loops operating

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:38.160
in sociological space that are producing a kind of chicken little outcome.

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:43.760
And so we're running around claiming that the sky is falling and dumping, tilting our

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:48.560
economic systems in a dangerous direction and spending untold hundreds of billions of

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:54.960
dollars addressing a problem that is ill defined and likely nowhere nearer of the magnitude

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:56.920
that we think it is.

01:11:56.920 --> 01:12:02.920
And so, and then I want to follow that with a, I tried to make a strong case for why you

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:08.560
might be regarded with a certain degree of apprehension from the perspective of the climate

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:11.560
apocalypse, but I'm also curious about this.

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:18.120
The piece of data that has really emerged as most striking to me on the environmental

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:24.880
front over the last 20 years is the recent observations, they've been going on for about

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:33.200
five years or 10 years perhaps, that one of the consequences of extra carbon dioxide output

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:41.000
is that the planet has greened 15% since the dawn of the millennia and that most of that

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.600
greening has taken place in what would have otherwise been semi-arid and rather denuded

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.400
areas.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:56.720
And so I don't see a statistic on the anti-carbon front that's as powerful negatively as the

01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:02.160
statistic that the planet is 15% greener and that our crops are also in a consequence

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:06.080
quite a lot more productive on the pro-carbon dioxide front.

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:10.880
So you made the claim earlier that maybe we're in for a period of cooling, that's within

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:15.240
the error predictions of the models, but I would like to say, well, why shouldn't I

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:21.040
look at the fact that the planet has got 15% greener in 15 years, that's an area bigger

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:26.680
than the United States and say, well, why are we so sure that carbon dioxide output is

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:28.760
a bad thing at all?

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:33.880
I mean, some of the people who initially hypothesized about the greenhouse effect were quite effusive

01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:38.800
in their predictions that this would produce a greener, more lush and more productive world,

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:40.520
a more habitable world.

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:46.880
So is it unreasonable to put that forward as a proposition?

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:56.440
Again, the apocalypse types are pushing extreme weather events as being caused by warming.

01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:02.720
The hurricanes, the Pakistan flooding, the heat waves, unusual this, that, and the other.

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:07.240
This is what they're pushing as being caused by warming.

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:16.720
It's conceivable that there is some element of contribution from fossil-fueled warming

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:24.120
to this, but it's because of the large amount of natural weather and climate variability,

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:26.200
it's impossible to discern.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:32.760
I mean, if we were to immediately stop emitting fossil fuels, we probably wouldn't notice

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:39.120
any change in the weather throughout the rest of the 21st century.

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:45.480
So this is the key error in logic that people have been made.

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:48.960
Well, I mean, it's not an error in logic.

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:54.840
It's a very effective selling point for the alarmist, but people have bought it and people

01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:56.120
have weather amnesia.

01:14:56.120 --> 01:15:02.720
I mean, if you just look back to the 1950s to the 1930s or whatever, the weather was

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:07.360
much worse, certainly in North America.

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:11.320
So it's just something that doesn't make sense.

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:15.880
Does that mean we should just keep amping up the fossil-fuel emissions?

01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:22.080
No, we just really don't quite understand the consequences of this, but neither does

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:33.800
it imply that we should urgently reduce emissions and disrupt the global energy systems that

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:41.240
will make people less off and less well off and more vulnerable to whatever extreme weather

01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:44.680
and climate events might happen to occur.

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:49.440
So we're hurting ourselves, but we're not doing much in the way of reducing emissions

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:57.920
anyways, and we're just making ourselves less prosperous and more vulnerable to extreme

01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:59.080
weather events.

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:05.320
Well, OK, so there's two consequences of that, I would say, is the first is if we do make

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:09.880
people less well off by making energy much more expensive, by restricting fossil-fuel

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:15.680
use like unreasonably, let's say, or by not pursuing nuclear power, for example, as an

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:17.000
alternative.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.280
The major consequence of that will be that a lot of poor people who are right on the

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:27.880
edge and there's lots of them are poorer than they need to be and will be off the edge.

01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:32.160
And the consequence of that is, as you already pointed out, that if anything untoward does

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:35.760
happen on the weather front, they're going to be much more vulnerable to that.

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:42.360
I mean, distinguishing between infrastructure inadequacy and weather catastrophe is very,

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:43.360
very difficult.

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:49.760
Even when Katrina hit New Orleans, you could say that it was a natural disaster.

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:54.520
But you could also say it was an abject failure of planning, because the Army Corps of Engineer

01:16:54.520 --> 01:17:01.520
Dykes were only designed to withstand a one-in-a-hundred-year storm, whereas when the Dutch built Dykes, they designed

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:04.760
them to withstand a one-in-ten-thousand-year storm.

01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:08.880
So whether that was a natural disaster or a consequence of human foolishness is not

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:10.640
precisely obvious.

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:13.360
And the same thing applies on the energy front.

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:19.560
If we impoverish the already poor by making energy expensive, not only do we expose them

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:25.000
to much more risk to life and limb, let's say, and property, but we also decrease the

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.040
probability that those self-same people are going to be able to take an environmentally

01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:35.160
oriented view, because the data indicates that if you can get people up to producing

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:42.240
or benefiting from economic growth to the tune of about $5,000 a year in average GDP,

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:47.240
then they start to take a medium to long-term view of the future and start to attend much

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:51.320
more carefully to what you might describe as environmental concerns.

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:56.600
So panicking about climate in the way that we're doing, if the consequence is to raise

01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:01.400
energy prices and impoverish people, looks like it's going to kill more people first

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:03.120
because they'll be more vulnerable.

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:07.960
And second, that it's going to make, it's going to deliver as far fewer people who are

01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:13.560
capable of taking the kind of medium to long-term view of sustainability that would be actually

01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:17.520
beneficial to producing a more livable planet.

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:20.440
And I still want to ask your opinion about the greening.

01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:22.920
Yeah, the greening's happening.

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:28.840
I think it's attributed mostly to carbon dioxide, but also more rainfall and warmer temperatures

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.360
in help.

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:41.320
So the greening is definitely a benefit that the greening is happening over a big portion

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:44.080
of the globe, actually.

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:48.200
So it's clearly a benefit.

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:53.720
Well, it's also so perverse, because one of the, it's perverse is the fact that the Americans

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:57.440
decreased their carbon output by returning to fracking.

01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:58.680
Nobody predicted that.

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:04.840
But here we have a situation where not only is the planet not getting browner and drier,

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:11.120
which was the apocalyptic vision, but many of the areas that were really brown and dry,

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:17.120
like the southern edge of the Sahara Desert, are actually seeing the ingress of vegetation

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:21.880
in a manner that's, well, unprecedented even up to 15 years ago.

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:28.640
And so not only is that not what was predicted, it's the very opposite of what's predicted.

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:35.800
And it's the opposite in a very, very massive manner.

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:40.680
I mean, 15% increase in greening is just, it's almost beyond comprehension.

01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:45.200
As I said, that's an area bigger than the continental United States.

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:49.200
And then to say as well that that's also produced quite an increment in the productivity of

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:53.120
human crops and enabled us to grow more food in less area.

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:57.520
So like, those are facts that need to be taken with dead seriousness.

01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:59.240
They're very positive, perhaps.

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:04.360
I mean, you could argue that maybe that rate of vegetation change brings with it threats

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:07.720
that we haven't yet envisioned, and that could be the case.

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:13.120
But nonetheless, this, it certainly isn't the spreading of the deserts that we were

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:15.440
led to be apprehensive of.

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:17.240
Well, that's correct.

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:25.920
Again, the framing of this going back to 1992 was around dangerous anthropogenic interference

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:27.440
in the climate system.

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:29.880
So the focus was on dangers.

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:31.240
They were looking for dangers.

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:40.360
The benefits, you know, weren't even acknowledged until maybe the fifth assessment report in

01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:41.360
the IPCC.

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:47.160
I mean, everything, they were just looking for dangers, that there was no counterweight

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:48.240
of the benefits.

01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:49.240
So.

01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:50.240
Right.

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:51.240
Right.

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:52.240
And no cost benefit analysis.

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.400
I mean, I've talked to Bjorn Lomburg a lot.

01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:55.400
Yeah.

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:59.320
The reason I went after that was that I looked through all the data that you're describing

01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:01.160
for a long period of time.

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:05.760
One of the things that struck me, and struck me as well about the multiplicity of goals

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:11.240
that the UN was hypothetically pursuing, was that no one was assessing these risks

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:15.280
and benefits in any systematic manner, ranking them.

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:19.800
And then I came across Lomburg's work, and he tried to do a cost benefit analysis, looking

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:25.640
at our capacity to adapt and ranking the problems that face us in terms of their severity

01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:29.520
and also what we could do about those problems in some effective manner.

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:36.040
And like Lomburg, like you, accepts the IPCC prognostications of a mild warming trend

01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:41.520
over the next hundred years, but he's done calculations showing that the net consequence

01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:47.200
of that, even if it is somewhat detrimental economically, if we factor all those costs

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:53.040
into account, is that we'll be less, more rich than we would otherwise be, right?

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:58.400
Because our GDP is going to increase something like 400% on average in the next hundred

01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:03.560
years, and one of the negative consequences of global warming will be that it'll be slightly

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:06.000
less than 400%.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.720
And that it's clear that we can manage that in any real sense, and that we're very good

01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:16.520
at adapting to a huge range of weather situations and climate scenarios.

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:20.880
Some of us live in damn near Arctic conditions, and other people live in the desert.

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:26.000
And so it's not outside the realm of human adaptation to adapt to a one or two degree

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.840
climate transformation.

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:32.560
And animals should be able to do the same, assuming that we're reasonably intelligent

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:35.560
on the environmental conservation front.

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:40.240
And so, I don't know, are you aware of Lomburg's work?

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:41.240
What do you think of-

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:49.080
Oh, yeah, no, Bjorn and I are in close contact, and I'm very well aware of what he's doing,

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:53.080
and he's doing a very good job of making those points.

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:58.520
The thing that, you know, the UN has the 17 sustainability goals.

01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:03.760
I think the first one is to eliminate poverty.

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:06.600
The second one is to eliminate hunger.

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:16.520
The number seven is energy, affordable energy for all, and the number 13 is climate action.

01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:21.800
And you've got to wonder, how did climate action, even one piece of that, which is elimination

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:31.640
of fossil fuels, come to Trump, elimination of poverty and elimination of hunger?

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:38.520
Climate aid from the UN, from the World Bank and whatever is now focused on mitigation,

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:43.880
the traditional objectives of economic development and help with adaptation.

01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:49.480
Those are put on the back burner in favor of mitigation.

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:56.240
And this is making people less well off, and we're squandering opportunities for human

01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:57.240
development.

01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:06.000
You know, for senseless objectives that aren't expected to improve anyone's life over the

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:10.360
course of the 21st century and could very well make us all worse off.

01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:17.080
Okay, so this is part of the incomprehensibility of this to me, because it looks to me like

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:24.040
a lot of the arguments, for example, that would force us to take the apocalyptic prognostications

01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:25.680
of the doomsayer seriously.

01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:32.600
The moral arguments go something like this, well, you know, a hundred years if there's

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:37.400
a lot of climate change, it's primarily going to be the world's poor who pay the largest

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:40.200
price for that, the world's poor and oppressed.

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:46.000
And to mitigate against that, we have to adopt policies that however painful they are in

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.520
the short term, will mitigate against that because of our concern for the long term viability

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:54.760
of, let's say, these poverty-stricken people.

01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:59.000
But the problem with that is that the models aren't very reliable, and it's absolutely

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:04.280
100% certain that if we raise energy prices, which we have been doing quite effectively,

01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:10.080
and food prices, we're going to make life much more difficult for impoverished people throughout

01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:12.120
the developing world right now.

01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:16.000
And in a way that's going to kill plenty of people, and it's certainly going to deprive

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:21.500
many others of educational opportunity and nutritional, optimal nutritional input and

01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:25.340
all of that, 100% certain that's going to occur.

01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:31.860
But the moral aspect is, well, we shouldn't be doing things that would endanger those

01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:34.180
people who are oppressed and poor.

01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:37.900
But the policies we're pursuing do precisely that.

01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:43.940
So again, I'm still left with this complete incapacity to understand how this can possibly

01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:45.100
be the case.

01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:49.580
I don't get it because there's lots of other things we could be doing.

01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:54.180
Well, leaders in Africa are quite outspoken.

01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:57.700
They're on the front lines of being the victims of all this.

01:25:57.700 --> 01:26:06.820
They refer to green colonialism, energy apartheid that they're facing over this global warming

01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:07.820
policies.

01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:08.940
Right, right, right.

01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:14.220
And they can't get loans from development banks to build.

01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:20.820
They have plenty of fossil natural gas, coal, a lot of fossil fuel resources in Africa.

01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:26.380
They can't get loans to build their own power plants.

01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:32.340
The only thing that they're able to do is sell their fuel to Europe.

01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:40.500
So Europe is exploiting them doubly by taking their fuel, but not allowing it.

01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:46.300
It's politically incorrect for these banks to fund the development of power plants.

01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:50.220
So the Africans can develop their own economy.

01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:51.220
It's just evil.

01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:55.700
And I think green colonialism and energy apartheid are perfect descriptors for what's

01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:56.700
going on.

01:26:56.700 --> 01:27:03.820
Well, it's just, again, it leaves me open mouthed in amazement that we in the developed

01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:09.740
world with our functional economies and our high level of luxury and security can say

01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:14.660
to developing worlds, the developing world, well, you know, we've got it pretty good here

01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:16.940
and we're probably willing to cut back a little bit.

01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:21.820
But you guys down there in the developing countries, you know, you should be pretty damn careful

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:25.780
about your carbon output because, you know, we've only got one planet.

01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:29.460
And so it isn't really obvious that any of you should have the same kind of benefits

01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:30.460
that we have.

01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:33.700
The planet can't sustain that level of luxury and security.

01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:37.180
And so we're just not going to let you have any money.

01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:41.420
We're not going to help you develop your economy so that you can benefit from the same industrial

01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:48.020
revolution that has enabled us to educate our children and to have plenty to eat and

01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:50.620
to be warm in the winter and cool in the summer.

01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:55.660
And then what's even more preposterous is it's the very people who are constantly clamoring

01:27:55.660 --> 01:28:02.460
about the oppressive nature of Western culture who are foisting this very story on these

01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:03.820
developed countries.

01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:11.780
Yeah, the irony is that even if the African nations were given, you know, the carbon credits

01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:17.780
or whatever and allowed to develop to where they want to be and where anyone expects them

01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:24.260
to be, at most they would be emitting like five or six percent of global emissions.

01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:28.940
And this is for like a billion people in the population.

01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:35.220
So we're not talking about a lot of extra emissions to allow them to develop.

01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:37.900
I mean, it just makes absolutely no sense.

01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:39.220
And it's evil.

01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:40.220
It's absolutely evil.

01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:42.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:43.580
That's how it looks to me too.

01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:49.500
Well, I'm glad to hear that you regard Lomborg as a credible commentator on such things.

01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:55.540
Well, you know, I've looked across a wide variety of political and scientific thinkers over

01:28:55.620 --> 01:29:01.980
a 20-year period trying to identify people that I believe to be credible on the interface

01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:06.940
between economic development and energy and environmental management.

01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:10.220
And I like Schellenberger.

01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:13.500
I think Eppstein has some interesting things to say.

01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:17.620
I like Marion Tupi.

01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:19.740
What's the English?

01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:21.740
What's his name?

01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:22.740
Richard Tull.

01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:23.740
Matt Ridley.

01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:24.740
I think Ridley is good.

01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:25.740
Yeah, yeah.

01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:29.900
And so, but of all those people, I think Lomborg has done the most credible job.

01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:32.540
And he's also been given a damn rough ride in the media.

01:29:32.540 --> 01:29:38.140
I mean, he's doing pretty well now, I think, promoting his message, which is such a lovely,

01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:42.580
what he lays out is such a lovely scenario, because he shows how much good we could do

01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:47.500
in the world, especially with regard to the amelioration of absolute poverty and the provision

01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:52.860
of education, at such a tiny fraction of the amounts of money that are being devoted to

01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:58.180
this insane prevention of a non-existent climate apocalypse.

01:29:58.180 --> 01:30:03.220
And I've been doing everything I can for whatever it's worth to draw attention to his work.

01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:10.260
But the fact that he's been pilloried, like you've been pilloried, makes it, well, there's

01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:12.340
always a question lurking in the back of my mind.

01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:14.940
It's sort of like, well, where there's smoke, there's fire.

01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:19.180
If people are constantly being attacked for their views on moral grounds, maybe there's

01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:20.300
something to that.

01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:25.380
I certainly, I haven't been able to find that my analysis of your work, or Franzen's.

01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:30.380
I certainly have seen none of that whatsoever in relationship to Lomborg.

01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:33.340
So the mystery still remains for me.

01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:40.700
Okay, they went after Lomborg early on, you know, 2003, whatever, following his book,

01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:43.180
The Skeptical Environmentalist.

01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:55.060
The issue was that he didn't regard the reduction of fossil fuel emissions as the be all and

01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:56.060
end all.

01:30:56.060 --> 01:30:59.100
There were more important things to do.

01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:01.380
And for that, he got labeled.

01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:06.460
That was a very dangerous perspective, because they were just so set on this one particular

01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:16.940
policy for reasons, for poorly justified reasons, and for reasons that became harder

01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:20.100
to justify as time went on.

01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:22.380
And they're still stuck on this.

01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:28.340
And it just defies logic, and it's going to cause a lot of damage in the world.

01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:32.100
It defies logic unless your primary goal is easy moral virtue.

01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:36.540
So imagine, you know, the problem with Lomborg's work fundamentally, and this is the problem

01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:42.340
with marketing it too, is that he offers a multivariate and multidimensional analysis

01:31:42.340 --> 01:31:44.180
of the problems besetting the world.

01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:47.820
He says, well, we don't just have one problem, climate apocalypse.

01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:53.700
We have like 100 problems, and then we have the problem of how to rank order these problems.

01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:58.300
And then we have the problem of generating actual solutions and assessing them.

01:31:58.340 --> 01:32:03.060
And that's actually requires a lot of cognitive effort, you know, to walk through those.

01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:09.780
And so, but where if you're a climate apocalypse, you can reduce the entire panoply of human

01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:15.260
problems to one problem, and then you can put yourself forward as a moral person by

01:32:15.260 --> 01:32:19.700
just saying, well, I'm definitely concerned about the fate of the planet.

01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:22.780
And that's all anybody reasonable should be concerned about.

01:32:22.780 --> 01:32:29.580
And because I'm concerned in that manner, I'm a fully credible and reputationly remarkable

01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:30.580
person.

01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:35.700
And that's part of the psychological proclivity that is behind this.

01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:36.700
Okay.

01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:42.500
And so everything bad that happens, someone finds a path to blame it on climate change.

01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:43.500
Okay.

01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:44.500
Yeah.

01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:45.900
And the media amplifies it.

01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:48.500
And this gives politicians an easy out.

01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:55.620
So rather than dealing with their real problems, you know, poor land use, poor regulations,

01:32:55.620 --> 01:33:02.900
poor whatever inadequate infrastructure, whatever might be the cause of their actual problems,

01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:05.260
they simply blame it on global warming.

01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:07.420
And so that gives them an easy out.

01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:08.420
Yeah.

01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:12.420
I read an article yesterday that climate change was increasing the risk that women were being

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:13.660
abused in their homes.

01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:18.460
That was just a classic example, you know, and I mean, you know, you can't just say

01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:22.740
you can make the case that whatever produces economic instability is going to raise the

01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:28.180
roots, you know, the rates of abuse, but to link it directly to climate change is a really

01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:31.340
egregious example of exactly the kind of thing that you're describing.

01:33:31.340 --> 01:33:32.340
All right.

01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:35.100
Well, look, we're out of time on this segment.

01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:39.780
I'm going to talk to Dr. Curry for an additional half an hour on the Daily Wire Plus platform

01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:41.500
for those of you who are watching and listening.

01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:42.500
You might be interested in that.

01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:47.220
I'm going to talk about the development of her interest in her scientific endeavors

01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:50.980
and in her entrepreneurial endeavors as well.

01:33:50.980 --> 01:33:51.980
Hello everyone.

01:33:51.980 --> 01:33:58.540
I would encourage you to continue listening to my conversation with my guest on DailyWirePlus.com.
