1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,420
It's the Hebrews created history as we know it.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,500
You don't get away with anything and so you might think you can bend the fabric of reality

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,500
and that you can treat people instrumentally and that you can bow to the tyrant and violate

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,120
your conscience without cost.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,420
You will pay the piper.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,100
It's going to call you out of that slavery into freedom even if that pulls you into the

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,100
desert.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:30,700
And we're going to see that there's something else going on here that is far more cosmic

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,180
and deeper than what you can imagine.

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:41,460
The highest ethical spirit to which we're beholden is presented precisely as that spirit

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,940
that allies itself with the cause of freedom against tyranny.

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,940
Yes, exactly.

13
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,460
I want villains to get punished.

14
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,140
But do you want the villains to learn before they have to pay the ultimate price?

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,500
That's such a Christian question.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,620
You're optimizing for minimal impact and I think that is really the core of the modern

17
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,620
environmental movement.

18
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,420
It's not this just blanket collective desire for as much life as possible and we're somehow

19
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,740
getting in the way of that.

20
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,220
It's specifically against us.

21
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,660
They discovered the greenhouse effect.

22
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:26,540
They said this is going to on its own make the earth a much more lush place.

23
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,700
They speculated like the fruits are going to be bigger and everything is going to be

24
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,220
lush because we're going to have more farmland and more biological and it's kind of obvious.

25
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:40,060
If you have a warmer world with more CO2, it's a more tropical world with more life.

26
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,380
It's a more green world in the life sense of green and yet the green movement hates

27
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,540
it because we caused it.

28
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:52,340
They can see no good in anything we caused even when it leads to more biological productivity.

29
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:59,140
It's fundamentally an anti-human movement, not a pro-life of any kind movement.

30
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:05,740
The ineluctable conclusion that has to be drawn from that proposition is that any human

31
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:12,340
activity whatsoever is to be regarded as evil even if it increases total biological flourishing

32
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:19,380
in terms of let's say the net metric tonnage of biological life on the planet.

33
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:24,180
So that's also perverse because that is definitely a game that none of us can win.

34
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:30,820
If the a prior rule is no matter what you do, you're evil, then the only solution to that

35
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:46,700
is well how about a hell of a lot fewer of you.

36
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:52,420
Hello everyone watching and listening on YouTube or the associated podcast platforms.

37
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,220
I have with me today Alex Epstein.

38
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,420
I'm looking forward to this discussion.

39
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:03,680
He's a philosopher and energy expert who argues that human flourishing should be the guiding

40
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,740
principle and the appropriate metric for our energy and environmental policy and our determination

41
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,060
of its progress.

42
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:17,700
He's the author of the new book, Fossil Future, as well as the New York Times bestseller,

43
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,540
The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels, which was published in 2014.

44
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:27,980
He's also the creator of energytalkingpoints.com, a source of powerful, well-referenced talking

45
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,020
points on energy, environmental, and climate issues.

46
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:38,220
Epstein began his work in 2011 with the founding of the Center for Industrial Progress, a for-profit

47
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,300
think tank offering insights into the world of fossil fuels and fighting back against

48
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:48,660
the mainstream narrative of so-called environmentalism.

49
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,620
Only recognized as a master of persuasion and debate on energy issues, Alex has spoken

50
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:59,220
to dozens of Fortune 500 companies and at dozens of prominent universities, including

51
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,980
Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and Duke, his alma mater.

52
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:09,420
He's also a highly sought-after consultant on messaging, working with dozens of major

53
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,500
political offices on pro-energy, pro-freedom messaging.

54
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:21,740
We're here today to talk about the moral necessity of an energy-rich future, one that

55
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:29,020
both must and should rely on the abundant provision of the petro-based fuels so carelessly currently

56
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,540
demonized.

57
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:38,180
So welcome to all of you who are watching or listening, and welcome to Alex.

58
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,380
So maybe we could just start by having you walk through the book.

59
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:48,620
One of the things I found interesting to begin with was your discussion of the motivations,

60
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:54,100
let's say, of some of the more radical people that are pushing what is purported to be a

61
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,180
pro-environment stance.

62
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:04,420
People like Paul Ehrlich, who clearly have an agenda that could be more accurately conceptualized

63
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:11,420
as anti-human, certainly anti-industrial, rather than pro-environment.

64
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:16,420
And I think that's something that's worthwhile alerting everyone too, especially given the

65
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:21,900
current state of energy price increase in Europe, let's say, and the consequences that's going

66
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,100
to have for the poor around the world.

67
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,100
Let's start with that, though.

68
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,520
You wrote this book in 2014.

69
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,340
Let's talk about why you wrote it and how you think your prognostications have fared

70
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,220
in what's almost an intervening decade.

71
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,520
Well, I think one thing that's relevant, I'm not sure if you know this, but there's a new

72
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,640
book, 2022, called Fossil Future, which is the successor or replacement to the moral

73
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,500
case for fossil fuels.

74
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,540
So I talk a bunch in that about how the moral case for fossil fuels has fared.

75
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,100
And I think in terms of a predictive book, it's not primarily a predictive book, but

76
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,340
it has been extremely accurate.

77
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,220
Because if you look at what people have said in the last eight or so years, the main

78
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,340
narratives have been, we're not going to need fossil fuels as much as we used to.

79
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,420
They're going to be rapidly replaced by solar and wind primarily.

80
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:16,420
And that climate impact, the climate impact of fossil fuels, is going to be increasingly

81
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,420
catastrophic.

82
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:22,780
So we're going to see more and more suffering and death from climate-related disasters.

83
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,540
And in the book, I talk about that's not going to happen because, one, fossil fuels

84
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,660
will remain uniquely cost-effective, particularly in a world that needs far more energy, which

85
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,380
is something that was not stressed in the past and is not stressed enough today.

86
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,220
People are starting to realize most of the world doesn't have enough energy.

87
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,980
So replacing fossil fuels is almost impossible, given that you're not talking about just replacing

88
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,220
it for the people who use it, but for the people who need it.

89
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:52,160
So I've been very vindicated on the continuing cost effectiveness of fossil fuels.

90
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,940
And then on the climate disaster point, we have documented that climate-related disaster

91
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:02,020
deaths are down 98% in the last 100 years, and they've continued to decline.

92
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:07,740
And the basic reason is because whatever impact we have on climate that is negative, it is

93
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:13,460
far outweighed by our ability to master climate, to neutralize all sorts of climate dangers.

94
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:18,740
And so we're much better off overall climate-wise than we were 50 years ago and certainly 100

95
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,740
years ago.

96
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,340
So with regards to, let's start with the second one there, the climate disaster.

97
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:30,020
So the biophilic types, and so those would be people like Erlich, they seem to make the

98
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:36,780
case that metrics that involve human flourishing or even human death aren't relevant, because

99
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:42,580
the primary issue is to restore the biosphere to something approximating what it hypothetically

100
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:48,260
was before there were human beings, which is a rather strange notion, all things considered.

101
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:53,980
And so they might object to the fact that you're using the mere decrease in number of

102
00:07:53,980 --> 00:08:00,780
deaths associated with climate trouble with weather events as a metric, because the metric

103
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,740
should be something like the purity of the planet.

104
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,020
And so what do you think about that argument?

105
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,700
What metric should we be using to determine whether or not a climate emergency actually

106
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,700
exists?

107
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:19,420
Well, I definitely think we should be using a human flourishing metric, but in a broad

108
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,500
sense, the climate disaster deaths are not the only aspect of that, but they're a very

109
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
important aspect.

110
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,780
We can also see that damages are flat or down.

111
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,560
We can see that life overall is much better.

112
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,220
And actually our ability to preserve the most valuable parts of nature is better.

113
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,380
Generally when you're not dependent on the land and dependent on wood, dependent on your

114
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:45,020
local environment for your fuel and your wealthy, you can be much better at preserving the parts

115
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,260
of nature that you want to preserve.

116
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,820
If you look at places in Africa and Asia and even now Europe, because they're now energy

117
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,540
poor, like cutting down their forests, it's because they don't have better sources of

118
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,540
fuel.

119
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:01,140
So, but I would challenge the idea that Erlich is really using this.

120
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:06,460
I think you called it biophilic standard, because if you look at his public rhetoric,

121
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,380
he's always appealing to a human flourishing standard.

122
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,220
So how did Erlich become famous?

123
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,180
He became famous through the 1968 book, The Population Bomb, where he's telling human

124
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:21,220
beings not, hey, the planet is going to become more impacted and that's intrinsically bad.

125
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,100
He's saying you're all going to starve.

126
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,060
And his close colleague, Sean Holdren, who was Obama's chief science advisor, now he

127
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:32,060
predicted in the 80s that we'd have up to a billion climate related disaster deaths

128
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:37,060
from famine by 2020, which has come and gone and the world is better fed than ever.

129
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:43,380
So what I find is that people who I think internally, they don't really care about human

130
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,380
flourishing and they're really optimizing for eliminating our impact as much as possible,

131
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,820
but they appeal to human flourishing to win over converts.

132
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,780
Because if they really said the best possible earth is the one that would exist had we never

133
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:01,940
existed and our goal is to eliminate as much human impact as possible as an end in itself,

134
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,060
they would not win many converts.

135
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,860
Well, the lack of a red wave during the midterms leads to more reckless spending by a more

136
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,980
emboldened administration, higher taxes, deeper inflation.

137
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,500
If you're unsure how the next two years will unfold, talk to Birch Gold Group about protecting

138
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,380
your savings with gold.

139
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,820
Birch Gold makes it easy to convert your IRA or 401K into an IRA in precious metals so

140
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,660
you can own gold and silver in a tax-sheltered account.

141
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,420
Gold is the world's oldest, most proven form of currency.

142
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:36,100
When inflation soars and all other assets go sideways, gold is still there.

143
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,660
This month, you can get a free gold back with every $5,000 purchase when you convert an

144
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:46,980
existing IRA or 401K into a precious metals IRA with Birch Gold by December 22.

145
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,420
Just text Jordan to 98998.

146
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:54,500
Birch Gold will help you own gold and silver in a tax-sheltered account.

147
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,980
Text Jordan to 98998 to claim your free info kit on gold.

148
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,500
Then talk to one of their precious metals specialists.

149
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,980
With every purchase you make before December 22, you'll get a free gold back.

150
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,540
This is a great stocking stuffer just in time for Christmas.

151
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:14,300
Text Jordan to 98998 and protect yourself with gold today.

152
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:21,900
Okay, so the case that you're making in some sense is that the argument on the radical

153
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:29,620
pro-environmental side actually varies sometimes, so to speak, in secret or behind the scenes,

154
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,700
sort of voce, I suppose.

155
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,900
The argument is made that the planet would be better off.

156
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:38,580
It was returned to some natural and unspoiled condition.

157
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:44,100
But then public-facing, the arguments are essentially predicated on the argument that

158
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,460
if we don't do something drastic about, let's say, climate change, we're going to cause

159
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,580
a radical increase in actual human suffering.

160
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:56,820
Okay, so that all has to be straightened out conceptually before we, as a species, let's

161
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,380
say, can move forward intelligently on this front.

162
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:04,620
I think the most powerful point you made, however, and I think this is where the rubber

163
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:10,460
really hits the road in more modern times, is that even if you use the metrics that are

164
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:15,900
put forward by those who, let's say, oppose the continuing use of fossil fuel, so those

165
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:22,220
would be metrics associated with climate change remediation and environmental improvement,

166
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:28,260
the policies that are designed to drive energy costs upward do nothing at all that isn't

167
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,180
counterproductive by their own measurements.

168
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,420
So you pointed out, for example, and this is something that people really need to be

169
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:42,260
alerted to, is that because Europe has taken this absolutely foolish route to reliance

170
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:50,100
on wind and solar, which is intermittent at best, one of the things that's happening because

171
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:55,860
of the pressure on liquid natural gas supplies primarily is that there's a tremendous amount

172
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:01,620
of deforestation occurring in Europe at the moment because people have to turn to sources

173
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,300
of energy that are actually at hand so that they don't freeze in the dark in the middle

174
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,380
of the winter.

175
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,140
And so the thing that I find so appalling about what's happening on the environmental

176
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:16,820
front at the moment is that even by the metrics of the people who are pro-environmental, these

177
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:21,780
policies that are driving energy costs upward are utterly counterproductive.

178
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:27,820
And you know, humanprogress.org has a lovely graph showing the relationship between attention

179
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:35,020
paid to true medium to long-term environmental sustainability and overall wealth.

180
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:40,820
And what you see is that if you can get, as you make people wealthier, so as you remove

181
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:48,860
them from absolute poverty, their ability and willingness to attend to longer-term environmental

182
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,540
issue starts to increase rather than decreasing.

183
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,460
And so this has struck me for, I've known this for at least 10 years, that the best

184
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:01,820
pathway forward to a truly sustainable planet, even by the definitions of the environmentalists

185
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:07,100
themselves, is to drive energy costs downward to the point where we can remediate absolute

186
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:15,940
poverty so that people aren't driven to use up damaging and polluting immediately available

187
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,740
bioresources instead of turning to more efficient sources of energy.

188
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,340
And you are certainly making that case in the 2014 book, which as you pointed out, you've

189
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,300
updated.

190
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,840
So that's the critical issue, right?

191
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,860
Even by the metrics of the environmentalists themselves, the policies that we're presently

192
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:40,300
pursuing on the energy front are not only counterproductive environmentally, but they're driving poor people

193
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,300
into abject poverty.

194
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,180
We're going to see a lot of that in Europe.

195
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,840
I think it depends.

196
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:53,500
So I think if you take the quote environmentalists as having a kind of pro-human interest in

197
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,100
nature and pro-human interest in lack of pollution, this is true.

198
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:03,940
But my belief is that the core of it is the belief that human impact is inherently bad,

199
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,340
it's intrinsically immoral, and also the belief is it's inevitably self-destructive.

200
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:13,100
So nature is viewed as this God, that if we offend it through our impact, is going to

201
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,100
punish us.

202
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,660
And it really has this character where it's wrong, and doing the wrong thing is going

203
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,060
to destroy us.

204
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:24,420
And if you really think about it that way, all their policies make sense because their

205
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:30,300
policies are really aimed at making human life worse and ultimately reducing the human

206
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,300
population.

207
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,300
So it is true.

208
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,540
You can say, well, yeah, aren't you cutting down more trees?

209
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,900
Aren't you doing this?

210
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:40,620
But they would say, well, let's say we had cheap, free nuclear energy, which they've

211
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,940
actually commented on hypothetically when they thought fusion was possible.

212
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,460
I talk about this in moral case and in fossil future.

213
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,380
The leading environmentalist said this would be the worst thing ever.

214
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:55,100
A totally clean, cheap, abundant source of energy would be the worst thing ever because

215
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,980
of what we would do with it.

216
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,820
And one of the leaders called it giving an idiot child a machine gun.

217
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,620
And what they recognized is that energy is really our ability to do work, which means

218
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,540
our ability to impact the earth.

219
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,620
And when we use a lot of energy, we impact the earth a lot.

220
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:16,240
Now we impact it in a way that's beneficial to us, including we preserve the most valuable

221
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,120
parts of nature, and we give ourselves an ability to enjoy nature.

222
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,240
Nevertheless, it is a very humanized earth.

223
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,740
And to the anti-human environmental movement, that is offensive.

224
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,840
So that movement is not about a clean environment for us or for us to be able to contemplate

225
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,520
polar bears or go on safaris or any of this.

226
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,400
It's about a dehumanized earth.

227
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,200
It's the belief that we are uniquely bad and we need to get eliminated.

228
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
Right, right.

229
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,760
But the problem with that argument, even if you attempt to give the devil his due, let's

230
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:53,640
say, is that it's predicated on the idea that if we pursued policies to decrease our overall

231
00:16:53,640 --> 00:17:00,480
energy use, and if one of the consequences of those policies was the relatively radical

232
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:08,120
depopulation of the earth, perhaps by radically lowering birth rates, that while that transformation

233
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:15,000
was occurring, depopulation and deindustrialization, things would remain stable enough so that

234
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,480
in our new poverty and our hopelessness with regards to the future, we wouldn't be devouring

235
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,280
the planet while we were dying.

236
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,560
And I think that's a preposterous claim.

237
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:30,860
I don't see any peaceful way forward that's based on compulsion and poverty to reduce

238
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:35,280
the population of the world that isn't going to be absolutely destructive on the energy,

239
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,160
on the environment, on the environment front.

240
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,240
And the idea that if we had more energy, we would actually be worse for the planet, flies

241
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,040
in the face of what we've been discussing already, which is the fact that if people can't

242
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,640
turn to cheap and efficient and relatively clean sources of energy, and perhaps liquid

243
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,480
natural gas and nuclear would be at the top of that list, then they're going to absolutely

244
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,720
100% turn to much dirtier replacements, and we've already seen that happening in, well,

245
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
everywhere.

246
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,760
China is building coal-fired plants at a rate that's so rapid that everything the West

247
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,160
is doing on the climate amelioration front is absolutely irrelevant.

248
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,720
And what has the UK in the last week has already pledged to double its coal imports, and Germany

249
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,680
has had to turn to its coal-fired plants to provide backup power because wind and solar

250
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:35,000
has proved not only hyperexpensive, but so unreliable that, well, that when there's no

251
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,440
power, so when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing, you have to have backup,

252
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,720
and it's been coal that's been brought in as a stopgap.

253
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:52,000
So I just can't see any way, even if you accept the arguments that you just laid forward,

254
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,840
that there should be fewer people and that the right planet is one that's characterized

255
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:02,000
by minimal human action, I can't see any way forward to that on the energy poverty front

256
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,280
that's not going to be positively counterproductive.

257
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:12,080
I agree with you in terms of how it plays out, and I think it's important in general

258
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,560
this is not a scientific movement, and part of it not being a scientific movement is

259
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:22,400
it doesn't really have a long-term strategy for achieving its anti-human goals.

260
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,920
It has a lot of ritual in it, there's a lot of just hostility toward anything that has impact,

261
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,520
and you just oppose that, and then you assume things are going to get better.

262
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,760
And so people didn't think through what's going to happen when you make energy more expensive,

263
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,720
what's going to happen to the forest? They didn't think that through at all,

264
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,520
or when you oppose nuclear, what are you going to use in its stead? Or when you make energy

265
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,840
expensive, what's going to happen in terms of rights? It's not at all thought through,

266
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,000
and I think this might be a lesson for us to have when we contemplate these so-called plans

267
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,200
for net zero. This is a movement that's very much, it has this hostility toward human impact,

268
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,160
it opposes it wherever it sees it, and it just, it has a quality of nihilism to it.

269
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,080
And it's not thinking through, it's not thinking through either a dehumanized earth

270
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,680
or a human-friendly earth. It's sort of going after anything that has impact, but my argument is

271
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:19,040
we need to switch our hostility toward impact. This view that human impact is bad

272
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:24,560
needs to be challenged. Human impact is good if it makes the earth a better place for human flourishing.

273
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,400
The biggest banks and investment firms in the world are putting up to half of their total assets

274
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,920
into new investments. What do they know that we don't? Maybe that the economy is about to get

275
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:42,160
worse? The CEO of JP Morgan just warned that stocks could slide another 20%. Bigwigs are

276
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:47,280
moving their money into alternatives like fine art, because fine art has outpaced even the S&P

277
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:55,360
500 over the last 26 years by 131%. Even in 2022, Masterworks produced results. In early

278
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,360
November, Masterworks had a strategic exit for a 17.8% net return to their investors.

279
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,920
Their last three exits have brought in 17, 21, and 33% net returns. The next six months could

280
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,560
be some of the most important of your investing life. Paintings are selling out in minutes,

284
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:43,680
because one of the things I wonder about is why this idea that human beings are in some sense

285
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:52,880
in their activity antagonistic to the earth. It's a very peculiar metaphysical assumption,

286
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,920
especially for people who are hypothetically, biologically minded, because if we're living

287
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,960
creatures, which we clearly are, and if we've evolved in the same manner that other living

288
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,640
creatures have evolved, which seems relatively indisputable, then how is it that our very

289
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,240
existence is somehow antithetical to the flourishing of the biosphere, given that we're clearly part

290
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,440
of the biosphere? And you see this sort of thing with this idiot assumption, for example,

291
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:25,120
that bears some of the same hallmarks of this kind of quasi-philosophical thinking that

292
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,000
before the Europeans came to North America that the natives were living somehow in harmony with

293
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,080
nature, and that the entire biosphere was free of the scars of human interaction, and

294
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,760
that's utterly preposterous. I mean, the Native Americans were incredibly sophisticated agricultural

295
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:49,360
ists, and the Western Plains Indians burned the prairies with constantly to ensure that there

296
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:55,440
was a plentiful supply of the buffalo that they depended on. And so human beings have been

297
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,120
affecting the structure of the biosphere ever since we've been around, and that's for a very

298
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,640
long period of time. And the idea that there was somehow some pristine state of nature before

299
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,560
we emerged on the landscape, and that there's some moral imperative to return to that,

300
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,920
it strikes me, it's so incoherent that it's barely comprehensible. And there is something like a

301
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:22,720
hatred for humanity, as far as I can tell that's lurking underneath this, hatred for humanity,

302
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,880
certainly a hatred for industrialization. And those actually turn out to be the same thing.

303
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:33,520
I mean, one of the things that's really struck me as incomprehensible over the last few years is that,

304
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:39,920
especially on the left, is that you have these joint claims being put forward simultaneously

305
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:45,840
on the left, and one is that we're radically pro-environmental, and we're also the

306
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:52,480
philosophical doctrine that is standing up for the poor and oppressed. And I think, okay, well,

307
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,200
what happens when those two things are pitted against each other? And when are they pitted?

308
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,240
Well, they're pitted when it comes to discussions about cheap energy, because it's clearly the case,

309
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,800
and you outline this in your book quite nicely, that the most effective way of remediating absolute

310
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:16,000
poverty, so lifting people out of the privation that's associated, at least with lack of education,

311
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,960
but also with starvation itself, is to provide them with cheap energy, because as you pointed

312
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,120
out, there's no difference between energy and work, and there's no difference between work and

313
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:33,520
productivity. There's no difference between productivity and the eradication of poverty.

314
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,520
And so we are pursuing these expensive energy policies, and hypothetically, we're supposed

315
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,520
to benefit the planet, although we're not, but we are definitely dooming people who are already poor

316
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:52,240
to a much more truncated horizon of opportunity, and to absolute privation and starvation in many

317
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,960
cases. Yes, I think it's really... I mean, there are at least two really interesting issues raised

318
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,480
here, sort of this tension between the alleged concern for poverty and then the quote concern for

319
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,560
the environment, and then this question of how this bizarre view evolved, because this was not

320
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:13,200
the view of our environment and our impact 100 years ago. And interestingly, it's not the view

321
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,200
of our environment that anyone who lives near nature has. People who live in nature don't worship

322
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,880
nature as the superior God that can't be impacted. And I think it's my own understanding of the

323
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,960
history, and I really enjoy... There's a book by Einran called The New Left, The Anti-Industrial

324
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,080
Revolution, and it was written at the time that this was happening. And one of the analyses is

325
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,800
basically there's a transition between the old left and the new left, where the old left claimed

326
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:44,720
to be for industry, for productivity, for prosperity. And what happened is that was clearly

327
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,600
not achieved by their policies. Communism led to the devastation of industry, the malfunction of

328
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,880
industry, widespread poverty. And Einran said, well, the left basically had a choice. Are you

329
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,000
going to stay with your anti-capitalism, or are you going to embrace capitalism because you really

330
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,280
care about industry and productivity? And actually, what they did was they kept their

331
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,960
anti-capitalism, and they looked for new reasons to support anti-capitalism. And in the 60s,

332
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,240
they decided on this issue of environment. And it was a convenient issue in a number of ways.

333
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,960
One is the pro-capitalism side didn't do a very good job with it, particularly rhetorically.

334
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,360
They didn't make the point that, well, good environments are made possible by prosperity.

335
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:31,040
So the idea of a good environment in a humanistic way was co-opted by the anti-capitalist who had

336
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:36,560
no right to it whatsoever. I mean, look at the Soviet Union and an environment, but they owned

337
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:43,200
that value issue. But then they packaged it with this hostility toward human impact as such. And

338
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,840
what they really did brilliantly was they took over the schools. So in the schools, this idea

339
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,600
that human impact is bad, and especially the idea that it's inevitably self-destructive because the

340
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,880
planet is this delicate nurture that our impact ruins. And that has permeated the whole educational

341
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,600
system where people think that we inherently are destroyers of the planet, and it has permeated

342
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,880
the scientific community. What I call this delicate nurture dogma is unfortunately pervasive

343
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,480
in earth sciences today. It's a very primitive and bizarre view. It has nothing to do with reality

344
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,280
that our impact is inevitably self-destructive. Actually, our impact has made the earth much

345
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:24,160
better overall, including safer from climate. But nevertheless, I think it's really, there was

346
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:29,200
initially a real political motivation to spread this. But now we have this irrationalist philosophy

347
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,760
that has a mind of its own. Yeah, well, that's okay. So let's delve into that a little bit,

348
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,960
because the other thing that I've come to understand more clearly in the last 15 years,

349
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,160
let's say, as the data has also become more clear is that,

350
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,360
so we lifted more people out of poverty in absolute terms, and also in relative terms,

351
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:56,640
between 2000 and 2015, than we had lifted people out of poverty in the sum total of human endeavor

352
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:05,920
before that. And it's quite clear that the reason for that was that fewer countries pursued absolutely

353
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:11,360
counterproductive economic policies of the type that were put forward, let's say, by the

354
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,760
communists when the Cold War was raging. And so you saw all over the world, including in places like

355
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:26,720
Communist China, that there was a radical move towards something approximating free market and

356
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,120
free trade between individuals. And in some countries, that was implemented more effectively

357
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:37,280
than others. But wherever it was implemented, at least quasi effectively, people immediately

358
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:44,160
stopped starving. And so, and I'm trying to make a case in relationship to the anti-capitalism,

359
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:50,320
so let's say that you are a genuine classic leftist, and you are actually concerned with the poor,

360
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,280
especially remediation of absolute poverty, and you're looking at the data, and you see that

361
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:01,040
after the Soviet Union collapsed, and there were fewer countries turning to communist dogma to

362
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,400
formulate their economic policies, and more countries started to develop, started to participate

363
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:12,880
in the broad free market, that we drove poverty down to its lowest level in absolute numbers,

364
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,680
or in relative numbers, certainly, than we'd ever seen before in history. And so then again,

365
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:26,960
we're back to the same issue. If the spread of free market policies remediates absolute poverty,

366
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:34,640
which it clearly does, and in a staggeringly rapid manner, then what in the world is driving

367
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:42,000
the anti-capitalist ethos? You know, you said that there's this underlying metaphor of nature as

368
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,800
something like fragile virgin, right, continually what rendered susceptible to our raping and

369
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:54,960
pillaging. So there's a weird metaphor lurking at the bottom of all that, but given the overwhelming

370
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:01,920
data that something approximating free market frees people from absolute poverty, and then

371
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:06,720
conjoining that with the observation that richer people actually care more about the environment,

372
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,600
you're left again with this question of what in the world is motivating this. There's some deep

373
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:17,600
hatred. It's like a deep hatred for humanity itself, but even at the expense of the planet.

374
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,040
And so I still struggle with trying to comprehend that. There's a kind of existential guilt there

375
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,040
for the crime of existence itself. It's something like that.

376
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,640
I mean, I think there's one really powerful fact about the increase in prosperity that I draw

377
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,720
attention to a lot in fossil future, because I think it's very notable. So I point out, I was born

378
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:44,400
in 1980. Since 1980, we've gone from more than four in 10 people living on less than $2 a day,

379
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,040
and this is adjusted for inflation, to one in 10. So as you said, this is the greatest alleviation of

380
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:54,720
poverty in human history. Now, what's really interesting is if you survey, and this was done

381
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,800
in the UK, you might have seen this before, but there's a survey of college-educated adults in

382
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:04,640
the UK about what has happened to extreme poverty over the past 30 or 40 years. And this is just

383
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,880
an objective documented thing. There's no question. And so what happened is only 12% of people

384
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:18,880
thought it got better. 55% of people thought it got worse, and the rest thought it stayed

385
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,640
the same. And it just shows you the level of miseducation about this issue. And I do think

386
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,840
a lot of it is the modern anti-human environmental movement, because what they've done is they've

387
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,880
taught us that our impact ruins the planet. And so we just assume that because the world used

388
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,320
a lot more fossil fuels, particularly China and India did, which drove much of the increase

389
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,200
in prosperity, they just assume that the world is worse. And what I call, I don't use this term

390
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,840
in a moral case, but I use it in fossil future, our knowledge system. So the institutions we

391
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:57,680
rely on for expert knowledge and guidance, they've totally failed at educating us about how much

392
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:02,400
the world has improved from a human perspective. And this goes back to my argument that the

393
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:07,520
anti-human environmental movement, they're trying to pretend to be pro-human. So they don't want us

394
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,920
to know that the earth is a much better place than ever to live. They don't want us to know

395
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,160
that climate disaster deaths are way down. They don't want us to know about the decline in extreme

396
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:21,040
poverty, because it totally challenges their narrative that impact in general and fossil

397
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:26,560
fuels in particular are bad. And if we recognized how vital fossil fuels are, then we would be

398
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:32,160
really afraid of these proposals to get rid of fossil fuels in the next 27 years in a world

399
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,880
that needs far more energy. And unfortunately, we're starting to realize this involuntarily

400
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,760
because these policies just implemented one percent, these anti-fossil fuel policies,

401
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,160
just implemented to one percent success rate in the anti-fossil fuel movement's view

402
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:51,440
have already led to a global energy crisis. Do you have a coffee lover on your holiday

415
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:59,440
Right, right. Well, you knew said that the planet is getting better, let's say,

416
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,960
from a human perspective. And so we've looked at metrics like the radical decrease in absolute

417
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,800
privation. But we could turn our attention momentarily to the evidence that in many ways,

418
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,360
and somewhat paradoxically and perversely, the planet actually seems to be doing better

419
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:22,880
from the natural perspective too. Now, I have been concerned about, I have believed for a long

420
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:28,640
time that one of our focal concerns might be on the environmental front might appropriately be

421
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:34,560
something like remediation of misuse of oceanic resources, because I think we've done a pretty

422
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:45,040
cataclysmic job of protecting our, especially our coastal lands and the shelf environments

423
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,200
just off shore of the continents, where pretty much all the fish are. I think we've done a

424
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:55,760
catastrophic job of managing that. And there are genuine environmental problems that I think

425
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,320
sensible people should take into account. But, you know, I was looking at a graph this week,

426
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,400
and I've known about this phenomenon for quite a while, phenomenon for quite a while,

427
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:13,680
that again, in the last 15 years, a surface area totaling 15% of the entire planet has

428
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,280
greened. I mean, that is, that's an area that's larger than the continental United States,

429
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,360
and it's, so let's, let's walk through that for a minute, so just so everyone who's listening

430
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:30,400
is clear. In the last 15 years, the planet has not got less green, it's got more green, and not

431
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:37,920
only a little bit more green, stunningly more green, 15% in, essentially in 15 years, and that's an

432
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,160
area bigger than the continental United States, and that's happened pretty much everywhere in the

433
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,920
world. And then you might say, well, where is that happening? And perversely, and contrary to all

434
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:53,920
predictions, it's happening in the drier areas of the planet, especially in semi-arid areas,

435
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:02,080
and here's the reason. So plants have to breathe, and to breathe, they have to open pores on their

436
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:08,320
surface, and the problem for plants when they breathe with these pores is that they also allow

437
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:14,640
water to evaporate from their internal structures, and so the less carbon dioxide in the air, the

438
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,200
more the plants have to open their pores, and that means the more susceptible they are to drying out,

439
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,800
and that means that they struggle to exist in semi-arid areas. Now, what's happened as a consequence

440
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,680
of increased carbon dioxide production is that plants can breathe easier, and so they don't have

441
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:35,200
to open their pores to the same degree, and what's that, what that has meant is that the very desert

442
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,840
areas, at least the semi-arid areas, that the climate apocalypse were claiming would

443
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:48,160
expand and spread, so the desertification of the world, the exact opposite has happened,

444
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,200
and the Sahara Desert, for example, has shrunk to quite a stunning degree, and not only is the

445
00:36:53,200 --> 00:37:00,400
planet 15% greener than it was in 2000, but there are more trees in the northern hemisphere

446
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:07,760
than there were a hundred years ago, and as well as the planet greening, and so you can think about

447
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,920
that as a victory on the objective front for the natural world, at the same time the planet is green,

448
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,400
because it's easier for plants to survive, our food crops have become much more productive

449
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,960
for exactly the same reasons, and so as carbon dioxide output has increased, the planet has got,

450
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,480
not only has the planet got greener, it's got greener in the driest areas, which is absolutely

451
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:37,600
stunning and remarkable, and one of the consequences of that increased greening is that our agriculture

452
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:43,200
production has become not less efficient, but much more efficient, and so I'm really wrestling with

453
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,840
how to conceptualize that particular sense of statistics. I just thought of an idea, I just

454
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,360
thought of an idea, I've never thought of this before, so we're just trying it right now, but I

455
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,160
think maybe we can think of three conceptions of the earth which capture everything we're talking

456
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,520
about, so my primary conception is evaluating the earth from the perspective of human flourishing,

457
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:07,040
how hospitable to human beings is it, and this includes like a lush green beautiful world for

458
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,920
us to enjoy for many reasons you've talked about, but then the second one could be looking at the

459
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:18,320
earth in terms of just pure biological productivity, so just not even focusing on humans, just how much

460
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:24,000
life is on the planet, and this captures what you just mentioned with rising CO2 levels,

461
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,800
making a greener planet, but then the third one, and I think this is really the core of the modern

462
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:35,440
environmental movement, is an unimpacted planet, so you're not optimizing for biological productivity,

463
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,240
you're optimizing for minimal impact, and I think that is really the core of the modern

464
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,440
environmental movement, it's not this just blanket collective desire for as much life as possible,

465
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,200
and we're somehow getting in the way of that, it's specifically against us, and I think you

466
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:55,280
brought up the perfect example, which is the climate catastrophe movements total non-interest

467
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:02,080
in kind of the obvious biological productivity benefits of more CO2, and this was not shocking

468
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:06,800
or stunning, this is exactly what was predicted by the people who discovered the greenhouse effect,

469
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,600
when they discovered the greenhouse effect they said this is going to on its own make the earth a

470
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:18,000
much more lush place, they speculated like the fruits are going to be bigger and everything

471
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,080
is going to be lush because we're going to have more farmland and more biological, and it's kind

472
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:28,560
of obvious, if you have a warmer world with more CO2, it's a more tropical world with more life,

473
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,600
it's a more green world in the life sense of green, and yet the green movement hates it

474
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:39,920
because we caused it, so they can see no good in anything we caused, even when it leads to more

475
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,600
biological productivity, so I think what you're bringing up really shows it's fundamentally an

476
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:49,760
anti-human movement, not a pro-life of any kind. Right, right, okay, but let's let's talk about

477
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:57,920
that idea of impact, it's like well what is this hypothetical perfect world that exists statically

478
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:04,880
that would be pristine and morally valuable in the absence of human beings, I mean the biosphere

479
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:11,360
is a dynamic place obviously over any timescale and there's shift in what constitutes quote the

480
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:17,360
environment, there seems to be this presumption that at some point in the past when there was

481
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:24,000
minimal human activity the earth was somehow optimized in the biological but also the moral

482
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,480
sense and that any change in that whatsoever in any direction, hence climate change let's say rather

483
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:37,280
than global warming, any change in that whatsoever is to be regarded axiomatically as evil, but what

484
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:43,440
that essentially means as far as I can tell the ineluctible conclusion that has to be drawn from

485
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:50,960
that proposition is that any human activity whatsoever is to be regarded as evil on the

486
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,920
face of it, it doesn't matter what it does, and your point is that even if it increases bio,

487
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,760
even if it increases total biological flourishing in terms of like let's say the

488
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:08,880
net metric tonnage of biological life on the planet and so that's also perverse because that is

489
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:16,320
definitely a game that none of us can win, if the a prior rule is no matter what you do you're evil

490
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:22,080
then the only solution to that is well how about a hell of a lot fewer of you, but then you say well

491
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:27,280
what's that supposed to serve because if what we're doing now is actually making the planet more

492
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,560
green and I'm saying that very carefully because I know that that's not a sufficient metric, I am

493
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:39,440
very concerned with issues let's say or conscious of issues that are relevant like the potential loss

494
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:48,560
of biodiversity and also the overfishing of the oceans let's say, so even though the planet is

495
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,440
becoming greener that doesn't mean that there are no mistakes we're making on the environmental

496
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,560
front, but those mistakes have to be differentiated out and they're all addressable and you know as

497
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:03,680
we get richer too and we can do more with less and our agriculture becomes more efficient if we can

498
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:09,520
manage that, that also means even by the standards of the environmentalists themselves that we'll

499
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:17,120
be able to set aside reasonably large tracts of land and water to maintain them in something

500
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:22,880
approximating a pristine and untouched state, I mean that's certainly something that should be done

501
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:30,720
on the on the oceanic management front, I mean the data that I know suggests that if we set aside

502
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:36,240
a certain percentage of the coastal area as marine protected areas and that might not be the most

503
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,760
efficient way to manage the oceans but it's not bad that we'll reap the benefits of having

504
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:49,360
untouched nature so to speak which is an aesthetic and economic and environmental good but we'll also

505
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,160
be able to replenish the oceans in a manner that would be economically productive and so

506
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,280
well like why can't why the hell can't we have our cake and eat it too that is we can help people

507
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:06,160
become rich with the provision of of plentiful energy and then we can put aside tracts of the

508
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:11,440
world so that they're relatively untouched so that biology can do its thing and like what the

509
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,560
hell is the problem with that precisely? Well it's it's so I think you're pointing to something

510
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:21,040
really good and something really bad something really good is why my my new book is called

511
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,480
fossil future why global human flourishing requires more oil coal and natural gas not less but part

512
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,600
of it it does talk about we can you know we can increase all of these biological things we can

513
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:37,120
have a much more lush world we can enjoy nature much more this is fundamentally good news the more

514
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:43,120
energy we have the more control we have over earth and the more we can make everything about it better

515
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:49,040
for our purposes including aesthetic things that poor people can't possibly be confused by but the

516
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:55,120
bad thing here is it's really highlighting the nihilism of this view that human impact is bad

517
00:43:55,120 --> 00:44:00,960
and again I really think it's the view is not that we want a lush environment and human beings are

518
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,320
getting in the way of that we want biological productivity and human beings are getting away

519
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:10,160
because as you're pointing out they are opposing all human impact including obvious things that make

520
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:15,760
the world better and so it really is the view that if we did it it's bad and you ask something like

521
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,600
what is it serving but it's a nihilistic view so it's not really serving anything even when you

522
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:26,480
think when you think about unimpacted nature it's not this beautiful thing for us to enjoy

523
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:31,600
it's supposed to be protected from us so that's really the view including our enjoyment of this

524
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:39,040
evil of course our enjoyment is of no consequence whatsoever and in fossil future and in moral

525
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:44,000
case I have a lot of quotes from the leaders where they'll occasionally let this slip out where one

526
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,640
guy for example who was reviewing Bill McKibbin's book the end of nature talks about you know

527
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,280
like a flourishing biosphere is more important to me more important to me than one human or a

528
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,800
billion of them yeah yeah let me read that let me read that I've got it right here so this is

529
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:04,080
something that you cite in your 2014 book I'm gonna just read it so everybody can hear it and I would

530
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,720
I would ask everyone who's listening to really think about this because this gets to the this

531
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:16,880
strikes to the core of the issue as far as I can tell so for example this is from your book

532
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,360
in a Los Angeles Times review of the end of nature

533
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:28,000
McKibbin's influential book of 25 years ago predicting catastrophic climate change

534
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:35,680
David M. Graber research biologist for the National Park Service wrote this summary of

535
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:46,800
McKibbin's message McKibbin is a biocentrist and so am I we are not interested in the utility

536
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:55,760
of a particular species or free flowing river or ecosystem to mankind they have intrinsic value

537
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:02,320
more value to me than another human being that's a very interesting thing to say

538
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:07,120
or a billion of them which is also a very interesting thing to say human happiness and

539
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:14,000
certainly human fecundity are not as important as a wild and healthy planet

540
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:23,040
are no social scientists who remind me that people are part of nature but that isn't true

541
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:31,760
somewhere along the line at about a billion years ago maybe half that we quit the contract

542
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:38,400
and became a cancer we have become a plague upon ourselves and upon the earth

543
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:45,840
it is cosmically unlikely that the developed world will choose to end its orgy of fossil fuel

544
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:53,520
consumption and the third world its suicidal consumption of landscape until such time as

545
00:46:53,520 --> 00:47:03,520
Homo sapiens should decide to rejoin nature some of us can only hope for the right virus

546
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,760
to come along you know I cannot understand how anybody who is

547
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:19,600
positively predisposed to children let's might we might say could read something like that

548
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:25,920
and not be absolutely shocked to their core I mean so let's walk through the claims the first claim is

549
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:35,040
a an untouched natural landscape of any size whatever untouched means is more valuable in

550
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:41,520
and of itself than any individual human being or any group of people no matter how large the number

551
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:50,080
okay so the implication there is any number of human beings could be sacrificed in order to preserve

552
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:58,960
any geographically demarcated natural zone of any size so that's a yes a standard of comparative

553
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:08,640
value and then the cancer metaphor while human beings have deviated from the natural order whatever

554
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:14,080
that natural order is whatever our deviation consists of and we've deviated the same way

555
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:22,160
a cancer deviates so now the metaphor is human beings equal cancer and that's that's a hell of a

556
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:29,120
metaphor because what we do with cancer is strive to eradicate it so these metaphors have deep

557
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:34,560
motivational significance so that's a little bit on the appalling side let's say and it's grounded in

558
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:40,720
a very narrow malethusian view of the world which is that we're something like yeast cancer let's say

559
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,840
and left to our own devices will multiply unchecked until we devour everything in perish

560
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:53,280
which is a pretty dismal and only vaguely biologically centered view of how human beings

561
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,760
conduct themselves because we're not yeast in a bloody petri dish we're not yeast and the world

562
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,720
isn't a petri dish let's put it that way and then you add to that though the closing statement which

563
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:09,680
is something like those of us who are properly oriented in our moral endeavor in relationship to

564
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:18,080
the non-human world can only sit and pray that the right virus comes along so that what so that

565
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:25,280
we're we're radically depopulated to what to what degree down to the half a billion people that the

566
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:33,840
world can hypothetically sustain it's like every single bit of that to me reeks of an underlying

567
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:42,560
and barely veiled brutal genocidal impulse i agree and what i want to draw attention to is that

568
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:49,840
this mentality diluted or not to various degrees is leading our thinking about what to do about

569
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:55,280
fossil fuels which is an existential issue for the world because the reason i go into this

570
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,440
particularly in fossil future is the point i'm making is that the people and institutions

571
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:05,040
were trusting to evaluate what to do about this source of energy that powers the world that also

572
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:11,440
emits co2 and impacts the climate those people are not making that evaluation by anything resembling

573
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:16,960
the goal of advancing human flourishing on earth they are pursuing to a significant degree this

574
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:22,640
goal of eliminating human impact on earth and the economist george reisman had this article

575
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,880
a long time ago called the toxicity of environmentalism and one point he made that i never forgot

576
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:34,400
is he said listening to a modern environmentalist is like listening to a doctor who's on the side

577
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:40,080
of the germs somebody who doesn't have your best interests at heart and as an example

578
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:45,040
one of the people i pick on very deservedly in fossil future is michael man who's a climate

579
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:50,800
scientist and activist who is one of the leading advisors and if you look at michael man's statements

580
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:57,040
one thing he has said is the ideal population for earth is a billion people yeah yeah how can

581
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,600
you possibly say that there are eight billion people like how can you possibly look at earth

582
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:06,400
and say oh yeah it's too many people that has a murderous impulse to it if you just look at the

583
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,600
earth and you say oh yeah seven billion people should go and what i point out with michael man

584
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:16,000
is that if you look at how he's evaluating the issue he's totally indifferent to the benefits of

585
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,080
fossil fuels he has a whole book people can look it up called the madhouse effect about fossil

586
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:24,240
fuels and climate and he doesn't mention any benefits of fossil fuels for example he talks

587
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:28,960
about agriculture and fossil fuels he only talks about negatives he doesn't once mention

588
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:34,960
diesel powered agricultural equipment or natural gas derived fertilizer even though those make it

589
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:40,480
possible for us to feed eight billion people so what we have is an anti-human mentality

590
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:50,560
so so some of those who are listening likely don't know that the the very survival of about four

591
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:57,360
billion people so half the world's population depends in no small part on the provision of

592
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:04,880
ammonia as fertilizer and ammonia is primarily derived from natural gas and so what that means is

593
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:10,400
the not just on the energy front let's point this out is that the the very food that is

594
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:17,120
provisioning half the world's population is a direct consequence of the cheap and easy accessibility

595
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:24,560
of natural gas and so and so what what's the idea here that we're supposed to reduce our

596
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:30,800
provision of fossil fuels and what are we going to do on the ammonia on the ammonia front we're

597
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:37,360
going to drive the price of fertilizer ever more skyward well if we do that because that

598
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:42,800
would be the consequence of reducing the plentiful supply of natural gas if we do that then what will

599
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:48,880
happen is clearly food will get more expensive and so will energy but food will definitely get more

600
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:55,280
expensive and so what that will mean is that huge swath of the world's population that's

601
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:01,040
living on the edge where they can just right now afford enough food to feed themselves so they don't

602
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:07,600
suffer the consequences of nutritional privation or even die a huge proportion of those people

603
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:12,160
are going to be tipped back into absolute poverty their children are going to be intellectually

604
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:16,960
stunted as a consequence and they might well starve and then you think well why would we

605
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:21,920
do that and if the answer is well you know some of us really believe that the planet should only

606
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:28,080
have a billion people on it if that if we have to have any people at all then well maybe this is all

607
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:36,880
part of the unconscious drive towards and and conscious drive to some degree towards reducing

608
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:41,440
the planet's population no matter what the price may be and then you see how people justify this

609
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:46,000
they say things like well you know if we don't take emergency action right now which means

610
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:52,640
let's make the poor even poorer then the poor are really going to suffer a hundred years from now

611
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:58,320
and I think look I don't have a lot of confidence in your ability to predict even a decade out much

612
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:04,960
less a hundred years with your unstable economic models that are predicated on an equally unstable

613
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,920
climate model so we can forget about your capacity to prognosticate a hundred years down the road

614
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:15,440
but what you're saying essentially is that the hypothetical poor that occupy my utopian

615
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:22,240
imagination are much more important than the actual poor right now who will definitely die

616
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:29,840
if we implement our higher energy price inducing hypothetical environmental policies

617
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:34,240
you know and one of the things that strikes me is so utterly absurd it's partly why I found your

618
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:40,560
book so interesting is that somehow the people who are making such arguments have gained the moral

619
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:45,680
upper hand even though you don't have to scrape beneath the surface very far to see not only the

620
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:53,600
genocidal metaphor and the genocidal intent but the actual genocidal impact of these policies

621
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,760
because we're definitely tipping people back into absolute privation

622
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:03,600
we'll be right back to our conversation with alex epstein in just a moment

623
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:08,000
first we wanted to give you a sneak peek at jordan's new documentary logos and literacy

624
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:17,920
I was very much struck by how the translation of the biblical writings jump started the development

625
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:24,640
of literacy across the entire world illiteracy was the norm the pastor's home was the first school

626
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:31,600
and every morning it would begin with singing the christian faith is a singing religion probably

627
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:37,360
80 percent of scripture memorization today exists only because of what is sung this is amazing here

628
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:46,320
we have a guttenberg bible printed on the press of yohan guttenberg science and religion are opposing

629
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:53,120
forces in the world but historically that has not been the case now the book is available to everyone

630
00:55:53,120 --> 00:56:01,440
from Shakespeare to modern education and medicine and science to to civilization itself

631
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,800
it is the most influential book in all of history and hopefully people can walk away

632
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,200
with at least a sense of that

633
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,840
yeah there's a lot of there's a lot of really interesting stuff going on I mean I think one

634
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:22,720
thing why do they have the moral high ground and this is something that is really a core mission of

635
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:28,080
mine to correct is that as I mentioned before they really owned the issue of a good environment

636
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:33,440
starting in the 60s including loving nature including caring about clean air and clean water

637
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,400
and more recently caring about safety from climate and that the pro-capitalism side really didn't

638
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,560
concern them to concern themselves too much with this rhetorically at least and so the

639
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:47,840
anti-capitalist side was able to own this issue and when you own something as important as our

640
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:53,680
environment and our planet you do get the moral high ground and then they supplemented this

641
00:56:53,680 --> 00:57:00,480
with this false alternative of you are either a climate change believer who hates fossil fuels

642
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,600
or you're a climate change denier who thinks fossil fuels are okay so they created this

643
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:10,400
total fossil alternative which made no sense because what makes sense with climate impact

644
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:15,360
is to weigh it along with the benefits of fossil fuels you cannot judge a prescription drug

645
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:20,080
by only looking at negative side effects and you can't judge fossil fuels by only looking at

646
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:23,920
negative side effects or exaggerate a negative side effects you have to look carefully at our

647
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,880
climate impacts negative and positive and then weigh them against the benefits that come with

648
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:33,040
fossil fuels including all the benefits that protect us from climate so there's this false

649
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:37,760
alternative so what they did is they owned the morality of caring about our environment and they

650
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,720
owned the claim to science because the climate change denial thing so-called didn't make much

651
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:47,760
sense because it's pretty obvious we impact climate at least some but so doing those two

652
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,600
things they owned this issue so people think well if I want to be a good person if I want a good

653
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:56,560
planet and I want to be pro-science then I have to hate fossil fuels and a lot of what I've tried

654
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:00,640
to do and I think Michael Schellenberger of Bjorn Lomborg and Steve Kuhn and I think what we've

655
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:07,360
tried to do is look at climate in a humanistic full context way and we're breaking this false

656
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:11,120
alternative which is a lot of the reason we get a lot of hostility so you said something there

657
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:15,760
that's very psychologically interesting so you said if I want to be a good person

658
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:22,800
because the environmentalists have captured this pro-planet narrative if I want to be a good person

659
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:28,560
then I have to buy the human beings are bad for the planet narrative but I'd like to take that

660
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:35,360
apart a little bit too because it's not exactly true what you said the truth of the matter is

661
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:41,440
something like if I want to take a shortcut to a good person without having to being a good

662
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:48,480
person without having to put into the process any real time and effort so that would mean

663
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:53,200
actually understanding the issues that are associated with environmental management and

664
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:59,760
economic sustainability which is unbelievably complicated I mean Bjorn while in U2 Schellenberger

665
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:04,800
spent their whole lives devoted to that endeavor trying to wade through the complexities it's

666
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:11,920
actually really difficult to develop a sophisticated and genuinely moral stance on the environment

667
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:18,320
and the economy it takes years and years of work and it's also extremely difficult to be a good

668
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:24,160
person and merely feeling sorry for the planet does not make you a good person in fact what it

669
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:31,760
makes you is a shallow narcissist who's using the easy identification with a genocidal ideology

670
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:39,920
to elevate yourself in the moral hierarchy and we we see people who are peddling this this dreadful

671
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:46,960
story to young people and offering them an easy shortcut to something approximating

672
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:51,440
easily trumpeted moral virtue and that's the sort of moral virtue that you can post on your

673
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:56,480
Facebook page when you claim that while you're anti-capitalist and you're in favor of the planet

674
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,880
and therefore all of a sudden you're actually a moral actor and someone to be regarded with

675
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:06,160
admiration and none of that's true because it's actually it's very difficult to be a good person

676
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:12,160
but it's very powerful that I agree entirely but it is very powerful and one thing I talk

677
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:18,080
about in fossil future and this is a big mission of mine is the moral monopoly of what I call the

678
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:23,520
moral case for eliminating fossil fuels has to be broken and when you have what I call a moral

679
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:29,520
monopoly you basically get a halo over your head for saying I hate fossil fuels I care about the

680
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:34,560
climate I care about the planet you don't need to do anything you just need to express this sentiment

681
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:38,640
doesn't matter you can we see you can fly on private jets you can live any lifestyle that you

682
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:44,160
want as long as you say this you get this halo and the other side gets devil horns on their head

683
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:48,400
but part of what's happened with what I call the energy humanists including me and Bjorn and Michael

684
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:55,760
and Steve is that we have now shown that actually quote saving the planet in their false view is

685
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:02,000
hurting billions of people and dooming them to poverty and actually making our environment worse

686
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,760
and hurting biology and so now they hate that that's why there's such vicious attacks because

687
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:12,800
their racket is coming to a close you you want it to be a controversial the first thing before

688
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:17,280
winning a debate is actually creating a debate there hasn't even been a debate over the morality

689
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:22,560
of fossil fuels intel fairly recently and once the debate is created that that easy claim to

690
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:27,680
virtue will disappear and those people will just go pick the the next easy thing to join

691
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:35,120
yeah well you said that all you have to do is express the sentiment that you care for the

692
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:40,320
planet so that's something approximating a feeling or a subjective state of mind let's say yes I'm a

693
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:47,520
good person because I feel empathy for the planet which is a pretty damn low resolution definition

694
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:53,040
implementable morality but you know it's tied in with something else too so imagine you're trying

695
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:58,880
desperately to make that case that the reason I'm good is because I feel sorry for things including

696
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:06,160
the planet well then you have to also buttress that claim with the insistence that sentiment

697
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:12,880
subjective sentiment itself is the only valid arbiter of reality and so that's something like

698
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:21,120
I feel therefore I am and I see that this in this entire modern movement that insists that identity

699
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:28,240
is nothing other than subjective feeling is actually associated in a perverse manner

700
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:34,560
with this ability to justify a claim to moral superiority by appeal to sentiment it's like

701
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:42,240
it's people see a picture of a like a bedraggled kitten on on on the internet and they go oh

702
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:48,080
and they think that because they have that reflexive response which you know has a certain moral virtue

703
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:54,560
that all of a sudden they're morally admirable people and that's a lovely thing to believe

704
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:59,840
and you can extend that to something like well I'm so concerned about the planet that I can barely

705
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:05,280
sleep at night it's like well fair enough that might be an indicator of your moral virtue although

706
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:10,800
I suspect not but the real question is do you actually know anything about the problem have

707
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:17,520
you spent any work real work in differentiating your knowledge of the problem are you taking any

708
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:24,080
concrete steps whatsoever to solve it apart from hand waving sentimentally and do you have metrics

709
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:28,960
in place that actually help you measure whether or not what you're doing has a beneficial impact

710
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:34,800
and that's also complex that if you bring to people's attention the necessity of thinking it through

711
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:39,440
all they do is get irritated at you like they get irritated with longberg's a classic example

712
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:46,080
because he's the person I think and I'd like your opinion on this you know I don't think there is

713
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:53,120
anybody who's a more effective advocate for genuine progress on the environmental front

714
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:59,120
than Bjorn Lombard he's thought it through as far as I can tell more deeply than anyone else

715
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:07,760
perhaps in the world and it's stunning to me the degree to which his ideals fail to gain traction

716
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,600
and I think partly it's because he makes the issue complicated right he says well we don't

717
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:19,120
have just one problem too much carbon we have like 20 problems or a hundred and and they all

718
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:23,680
need to be attended to but we need to rank order them and we have to do that in a methodologically

719
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:28,800
rigorous manner it's like well we don't want to do any of that we just want to feel good about what

720
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:33,840
we feel good about and we want to make a claim that that makes us morally virtuous and it's certainly

721
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:40,560
the case as far as I can tell that our educational systems are enticing young people to adopt exactly

722
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:47,040
that attitude and then to also engage in this demonization that you described so I think one

723
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:53,040
powerful dynamic with this this free virtue that you get by just saying I care about this issue I

724
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:58,960
care about the planet is that it's been given the stamp of science because it's considered scientific

725
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:03,440
to just say hey the planet is being destroyed by fossil fuels we need to do something about it

726
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:08,640
and it's really as long as you feel some way or you vote some way that is considered totally

727
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:13,920
sufficient there's nothing to think about but so it's really sad and shameful that science

728
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:18,640
has been has been stamped on this incredibly irresponsible way of thinking and one thing

729
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:22,720
I've tried to do and I think Bjorn does this but I think I do it probably most explicitly and I

730
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:27,600
think it's very very important to do it explicitly is I keep talking about the benefits of fossil

731
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:33,120
fuels and how how the other side is ignoring the benefits of fossil fuels so I go as far as to call

732
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:37,840
the other side fossil fuel benefit deniers I also call them climate mastery deniers because

733
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:43,040
they deny our ability to master climate danger and I think people can really get that we're

734
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:47,360
thinking about this issue in a way that makes no sense because we're only looking at the negative

735
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:51,520
side effects of fossil fuels we're not looking at the benefits and if you look at my work the

736
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:56,720
moral case for fossil fuels fossil future it's really stressing the goodness of fossil fuels

737
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:01,920
not just fossil fuels aren't as bad as you think but they're an actual positive good and I've seen

738
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,720
you make this case as well I think it's very very powerful it's imagine my book had been called

739
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:12,080
fossil fuels aren't quite as bad as you think it would have been no impact what's really needed

740
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:17,760
we've had this inverted morality that said that that says that food is poison and poison is food

741
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:22,080
and I think it's not enough to just to say oh they go too far it's to say no they are attacking

742
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:27,680
something good and once you are having a positive case for fossil fuels the other side goes on the

743
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:32,160
defensive you watch what happens when I debate when people will debate me they don't really have

744
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:37,360
an answer to looking at the full picture their answer is call me a climate change denier try to

745
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:42,880
smear me but they can't answer the argument of if you look at the full context benefits and

746
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:47,200
side effects of what's good for human flourishing fossil fuels are incredibly good and will remain

747
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:52,400
good for the foreseeable future and it's a pretty subtle argument that that climate change denier

748
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:57,600
phrase is a real interesting one too because that's a phrase that's so manipulatively

749
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:02,800
propagandistic that it's almost incomprehensible I mean the reason that that phrase emerged is

750
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:10,160
because there's been we've developed a universal consensus that denying the reality of the Holocaust

751
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:16,480
was a moral crime and so the propagandists took a leaf from that page and said well the people

752
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:22,480
who are denying the cataclysmic reality of climate change are as morally culpable as those who

753
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:27,600
deny the Holocaust which implies that they're as culpable as the Nazis who run the death camps

754
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:32,960
and that's a pretty decent smear and then you might say well what's the moral advantage to doing

755
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:38,160
that and so the first thing you might point out is well you get to have all the unearned moral

756
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:43,920
virtue that goes along with saying that just because you're sentimental about the planet

757
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:49,680
in some vague way that you're now a moral paragon and that solves all your moral problems

758
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:56,560
and then conveniently at the same time you get to identify a group of people who are essentially

759
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:02,000
satanic in their motivations and so that would be the climate change deniers and so that entire

760
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,560
problem of evil which you no longer contend with in your own life because you're on the side of the

761
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:12,480
moral is dumped at the feet of the people that you deem as enemies that's that form of scapegoating

762
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:18,320
that René Girard talked about and so young people are being enticed to do two things is one is to

763
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:26,400
adopt it three things to adopt an extremely simple minded view of the problems and opportunities that

764
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:33,360
confront us second to claim a completely unearned moral virtue merely on the basis of a vague sentiment

765
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:41,040
and third and more dangerously to localize the problem of evil in the minds and souls of the

766
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:46,880
people who are hypothetically opposed to their self aggrandizing sentiment and the combination of

767
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:52,720
those three moral errors is really dangerously toxic and that dangerous toxicity I would say is

768
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:58,400
manifesting itself in such things as these this idiot insistence let's say in the UK

769
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:04,160
because they're suffering from this more than any other place now maybe except Germany on the moral

770
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:09,920
benefits of an impossible net zero right the the rubber is really starting to hit the road

771
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:15,040
in the last couple of years as energy prices have spiked out of out of reach of many people

772
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:21,600
and the unreliability of these hypothetically benevolent renewables has become more and more

773
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:29,200
self-evident and so we're walking a very dangerous moral path here right easy moral virtue the the

774
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:35,120
our inability to point out that a lot of this moral virtue is driven by an unthinking ignorance

775
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:40,480
combined with this temptation to demonize those who are like lomborg shellenberger you

776
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:45,600
you're a good example as well who are standing up and saying hey wait a minute everyone um

777
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:52,480
we've lifted billions of people out of absolute privation and starvation as a consequence of the

778
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:57,920
utilization of fossil fuels and they're so fundamental that we can't shift away from them

779
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:03,200
rapidly that's actually practically impossible without tilting people into the kind of abject

780
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:07,600
poverty that's going to cause widespread starvation it's like that doesn't sound like a case being made

781
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:15,920
by satan to me no it's um i mean i do think that the energy crisis is an enormous educational

782
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:20,560
opportunity and it's obviously a tragedy and it's as somebody who's been talking about this for 15

783
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:26,560
years and advising in the opposite direction it's very sad to see me myself being right

784
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,360
in terms of if you artificially restrict the supply of fossil fuels in a world that needs

785
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:36,080
more energy and you don't have a viable near-term replacement then prices are going to skyrocket

786
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:39,760
including food prices and the price of everything else like this is this was obvious that this was

787
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:44,720
going to happen and it's hard to see it but at least the benefit is that people can see that the

788
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:50,480
establishment has failed that's the benefit of a crisis people see the establishment has failed

789
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:55,600
and the key is in my view two things one is the right people need to be implicated and the right

790
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:00,400
people need to be vindicated and i say the right people need to be implicated not as a vindictive

791
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:05,440
person at all uh but it's very important when you have a crisis and this happened with 9-11

792
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:09,680
happened with the financial crisis you know you need to have some idea of who is responsible

793
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:14,720
and then who was right and gave us better advice if you look at today's energy crisis

794
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:20,320
the number one thing that is scary about it is that it is a crisis that has come from the from

795
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:26,160
the net zero movement not even only achieving one percent of their goals so they have not even reduced

796
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:31,280
the supply of fossil fuels i want to stress that again they haven't even reduced the supply

797
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:35,760
they just slowed its rate of growth they already wanted to dramatically reduce the supply that was

798
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:41,120
their goal we were supposed to be using way less fossil fuel by now they just slowed the growth

799
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:46,160
and that was enough to cause a global energy crisis in a world that needs far more energy

800
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:50,400
so that should really wake us up what if we actually start on their path of getting rid of

801
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:56,320
fossil fuels and again we have 27 years now 27 years and less than a month as we record this

802
01:11:56,320 --> 01:12:00,720
to achieve net zero which in effect means getting rid of fossil fuels we could talk about offsets

803
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:06,240
and stuff that doesn't work at any scale that there's any evidence of so it's really this this

804
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:11,280
homicidal movement in its in its consequences and i do think people are waking up and they're

805
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:16,080
particularly waking up to the idea that hey we ignored the benefits of fossil fuels or what i

806
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:20,960
call our designated experts did this and these people need to be jettisoned you cannot listen

807
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:25,680
to anybody about energy and climate who ignores the benefits of fossil fuels to billions of people

808
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:30,320
because if you do you get an energy crisis and if we keep listening to them it's going to get a lot

809
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:36,400
worse well the other thing that you see being the drum being beaten on the side of the radical left

810
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:44,240
for example is the anti-colonial um let's say this continual trumpeting of the anti-colonial

811
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:50,880
interference message and so then i look at that and i think well you give the devil is due and the

812
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:55,600
fact that the world's cultures have come into contact with one another in a dramatic way in the

813
01:12:55,600 --> 01:13:02,880
last 300 years has produced all sorts of consequences some positive and some negative but um on the

814
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:08,080
anti-colonial front the environmental proposition and this is mostly coming from the radical left is

815
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:16,720
that there's no possible way that the third world inhabitants can be allowed much less encouraged

816
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:23,600
to develop a standard of living that in any manner approximates the profligate west is that

817
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:28,240
we're rich and you know maybe we should suffer from that a bit and maybe we should pay reparations

818
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:33,040
let's say but all those poor people who are desperately trying to clamber up the socioeconomic

819
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:39,280
hierarchy so they don't die let's let's make that perfectly clear they can't be allowed to do that

820
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:44,960
because their environmental footprint will immediately become so large that the planet

821
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:50,400
itself will be destroyed and so okay what's the consequence of that well the consequence of that

822
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:56,400
is that they should be poor and stay that way and should shut the hell up about it and should be happy

823
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:02,560
about it and perhaps there should be a hell of a lot fewer of them and if that doesn't trigger

824
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:09,760
your anti-colonialist morality then you've got some serious thinking to do because i just don't

825
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:15,120
understand at all how it is that those of us in the wealthy west and this would certainly include

826
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:23,280
those in the chattering environmental glitterati elite class i have no sense whatsoever how they're

827
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:30,960
in a moral position to be lecturing the developing world about how they should accept limits to growth

828
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:35,920
which means for example that their children won't have access to enough nutrition to even

829
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:41,360
optimize their their brain development as they mature it's like oh that's the price those people

830
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:48,320
get to pay hey those people those poor people in developing countries who don't get to be wealthy

831
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:54,080
and by wealthy means have enough to eat and have schools to send their children and we in the western

832
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:59,200
world we can sit on our high horse and say well we used fossil fuels and oops sorry about that and

833
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:05,600
all the carbon but you bastards you can just you can just accept your lot and if you stop breeding

834
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:11,280
so god damn much that would be a good thing too now how that is it's colonial to a degree that's

835
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:18,320
overwhelming is beyond me well it's it is and i think it's a very very powerful argument it's

836
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:23,120
been one of these things that has been ignored because the priorities of the modern environmental

837
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:27,040
movement are not what they say and i would say more broadly the anti-capitalist movement

838
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:31,680
they claim to be concerned about the poor but if you're concerned about the poor and you know that

839
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:37,120
fossil fueled productivity has brought an unprecedented number of people out of poverty

840
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:42,000
in recent decades you would think about how do we expand that how do we replicate what happened

841
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,800
in china what happened in india you know some changes to it obviously but how do we how do we

842
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:51,920
you know they use seven times more fossil fuels compared to four forty years ago like it's it's

843
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:57,360
obviously fueled their productivity and their prosperity why don't we do more of that and yet

844
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:02,160
there's been no attention paid in the culture to the energy poor there's no attention paid to the

845
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:07,040
fact we have three billion people who use less electricity than one of our refrigerators uses

846
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:11,360
we have a third of the world using wood and animal dung to eat their homes and to cook their food

847
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:15,760
and in terms of you're mentioning wealthy people three quarters of the world uses an amount of

848
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:20,880
energy that that we would consider totally unacceptable in the us or canada or anything

849
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:27,360
resembling that so once these facts are pointed out it is obvious that there is a moral imperative

850
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:34,240
to do at least nothing to get in the way of people using at least that at least that and it's clear

851
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:38,320
that the anti fossil fuel movement is absolutely getting in the way they're trying to destroy

852
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:43,920
all loans to fossil fuels there they're trying to encourage them to use things that will not

853
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:47,840
actually work for them they're trying to for example throughout africa limit oil and gas

854
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:52,880
development even though that's a huge potential source of prosperity but they're not winning this

855
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:57,200
argument once sunlight has been exposed and i had a personal experience i don't know if you heard

856
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:01,920
about this but the washington post tried to basically cancel my book fossil future back

857
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:06,320
before it came out they got a copy of the book they didn't read the book which i thought that was

858
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:11,280
their job as journalists to report on a book from a major author instead what they tried to do is

859
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:17,440
dig up what i had written in college where i had said very specifically the poor world needs more

860
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:22,640
capitalism and more individualism which i stand by but they somehow tried to portray that as

861
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:27,920
colonialism but here's the key their whole argument was alex epstein doesn't really care about the

862
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:32,640
poor so you don't have to listen to his arguments about the poor needing fossil fuels that this is

863
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:38,160
a bizarre ad hominem on its face it's completely the opposite of the truth but it was notable to me

864
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:43,440
how they had no answer to this argument that poor people need fossil fuels and that the

865
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:48,640
anti fossil fuel movement hurts the poor people most so i think that really shows the power of

866
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:54,480
this argument let's delve into that issue of caring about the poor because i don't think that

867
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:59,520
it is really all that wise for any of us to jump up and down about how much we care for the poor

868
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:04,880
because if you cared for the poor you'd be out there doing something with your life to directly

869
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:10,000
benefit the poor and that turns out to be extremely well i i have to i have to i don't mean i don't

870
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,760
mean you i don't mean you okay speaking more generally it's not that easy to care about the

871
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:21,280
poor and so i think that any of us who trumpet the idea that we truly care about the poor should

872
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:27,840
be very careful about that but having said that i would also say we could though say even if we

873
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:33,360
don't care about the poor any more than the typical somewhat selfish human being we could at least get

874
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:38,800
the hell out of their way when they're trying to clamber their way up the socioeconomic hierarchy

875
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:43,200
and that was the case that you made just a few minutes ago is that we could at least in the west

876
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:50,640
not implement policies that actually interfere in a serious manner with the attempts of the

877
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:54,880
developing world to lift themselves out of absolute privation we could at least get the

878
01:18:54,880 --> 01:19:00,000
hell out of the road and we wouldn't have to do that by hand waving about how moral we are in

879
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:06,160
our care for the poor we could say well we're relatively disinterested at minimum but we won't

880
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:11,920
go out of our way to make your lives more miserable than they have to be while you use your own efforts

881
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:17,360
to acquire for yourself some of the things that we've managed to acquire we can't even do that

882
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:22,080
i think it's a great point and so for me yeah i don't want to act like i'm just

883
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:26,960
ministering to every poor person in the world or this kind of thing i mean look i i live in a free

884
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:33,040
country i love doing work that i find really interesting and i love that it benefits a lot

885
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:38,320
of people including some of the poorest people in the world and one that the particular way in which

886
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:43,440
i identify with the poorest people in the world is with the lack of freedom because i really think

887
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:48,160
about what what would it like be like to not be born in the u.s whatever advantages i had being born

888
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:54,560
in the u.s is by far the greatest and i really think about you know how can more people be born

889
01:19:54,560 --> 01:20:01,120
into that and really the number one thing we need to do is spread good ideas and not spread bad ideas

890
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:05,360
and and this is where the antifausal field movement is so destructive particularly you've

891
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:10,240
probably seen this recent climate reparations thing yeah which is saying hey we owe the poor world

892
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:14,880
and i i wrote about this recently people can see it at energytalkingpoints.com which is where i post

893
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:21,040
my new stuff but the there's there's the idea that we should feel guilty for ruining the world and i

894
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:25,200
believe we've made the world better for everyone including the poor but the other element that

895
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:31,360
is obviously wrong is what is happening is we are paying people off usually dictators off

896
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:37,040
to not use fossil fuels so we are paying them to deprive people of the crucial freedom

897
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:42,320
to get prosperity and that is just totally shameful and that is absolutely interfering

898
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:48,480
in the lives of the world's poorest people right so with our so-called climate reparations

899
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:54,160
that are going to be devoted to the the governments of third world countries primarily we're going

900
01:20:54,160 --> 01:21:00,320
to be propping up frequently brutal quasi dictatorships and bribing them to keep their

901
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:06,800
populations poor yes so that we don't save the planet that's our plan

902
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:15,280
that is that is a plan i mean again it's it's not a movement that actually has any kind of goal

903
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:21,680
in strategy long term it's really just hostility toward any impact and at the moment it's CO2

904
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:26,720
emissions so anything that has CO2 emissions you hate but observe look there's no enthusiasm for

905
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:31,520
nuclear right which you would expect them to love because it doesn't emit CO2 there's hatred

906
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:36,640
for nuclear there's hatred for hydro and there's hatred for mining which is necessary for solar

907
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:41,600
and wind which require way more mined materials than anything else there's so it's really an

908
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:47,440
anti-impact movement that's just hostile to any human impact and just nihilistically and randomly

909
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:52,800
pursues that with no strategy and no thinking about the future and this mentality is leading the

910
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:58,320
world this is what i call our knowledge system it is blindly pursuing this destructive anti-human

911
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:04,240
path with no strategy okay so let's let's delve into that a little bit that motivation for that so

912
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:11,760
i'm going to play devil's advocate here a bit and and and let you respond to it so the first

913
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:18,320
thing we might point out is that the the human proclivity for something approximating unspoiled

914
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:24,000
natural vistas actually seems to have a moral element and a biologically rooted moral element

915
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:31,760
so for example our our aesthetic preferences seem to be associated with something like preference

916
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:37,520
for natural landscapes that are verdant and green and potentially productive in relationship to

917
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:44,400
agriculture and and the flourishing of let's say edible animals with enough water we like landscapes

918
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:48,960
that look like that we think they're beautiful and the idea that we might prefer those if they were

919
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:56,800
unspoiled is also worth delving into to some degree because we do need to live in

920
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:04,640
balanced harmony with such environments so that we don't destroy the very virtue that they

921
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:10,720
they implicitly contain and so and our aesthetic preferences tilt us in that direction and so we

922
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:19,120
have a bit of a biological tilt towards not wanting to gum up and pollute the works okay so

923
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:26,720
so there's that and then we also have this moral sense that we have a moral obligation right and

924
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:36,640
so the moral obligation is to be grateful to be cognizant of our unearned privilege and so for

925
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:41,520
you that would be the fact that you were born in the united states and that you were a accidental

926
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:46,880
beneficiary of all the work that had gone into that great society before you made your appearance

927
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:52,000
on the scene and that there's a moral obligation on your part in some sense to do something about

928
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:58,880
that right and so and that can both of those can be warped the warping of the first one is

929
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:05,440
to push that moral and aesthetic sensibility to the point where we claim that any human

930
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:13,920
interaction with that pristine environment whatsoever is tantamount to immorality and on

931
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:23,120
the second front it is that the way to atone for our privilege is by being guilty and stopping all

932
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:31,280
activity so those things dovetail we might say instead that if we wanted to genuinely contend

933
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:36,960
with the problem of our unearned privilege and the fact that you know we walk on blood that is

934
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:42,720
being we walk on land that is being soaked by the blood of conflict for generations right there's a

935
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:48,000
certain guilt in that a certain sense you might say even of original sin is that we do have to atone

936
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:54,320
but the proper proposition on the sophisticated front would be something like well we should atone

937
01:24:54,320 --> 01:25:00,640
by putting into place thoughtful and intelligent and genuinely pro-human environmental slash

938
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:07,360
economic policies and we should atone in our private lives for our unearned privilege by being

939
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:14,960
people whose moral striving is so admirable that we've justified the existence of our privileges

940
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:20,960
and we shouldn't be taking the easy way out and saying just because we're sentimental about Gaia

941
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:26,480
means that we've somehow fulfilled our moral obligation we're doing a very bad job of teaching

942
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:32,480
young people this as far as I can tell so like the guilt's there right the the sense of original

943
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:37,760
sin is there the sense that we're responsible for the atrocity of history in some sense is there

944
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:42,800
that needs to be contended with but we're constantly looking for easy ways out of the problem instead

945
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:48,640
of actually trying to address it head on well let's start out with the the first part in terms of

946
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:54,160
this this like sense of what we like in natural landscapes and we like life and so I certainly

947
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:59,360
have a version of this myself I mean I'm very obsessed with the ocean and I spend way more time

948
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:05,280
outdoors than most people and I just like I think people underrate being outdoors a lot and and you

949
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:09,840
know I love seeing different kinds of animals and their natural habitat so like I definitely

950
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:16,080
experienced this but when I when I think of it then what I think about is in impacting the earth

951
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:20,720
we want to make sure we impact the earth in a way that allows us to really enjoy this and in fact

952
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:26,240
have more of it there's a lot of things we can do to make the earth more beautiful and to enhance it

953
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:30,480
with respect to our aesthetic sensibilities and I think the the best thing forever in this regard

954
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:35,760
was Frank Lloyd Wright because if you look at his buildings and how he approached it he loved nature

955
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:40,240
but he also thought that we could improve nature and that's really what you're doing as a human

956
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:44,960
being is you're saying I can improve nature so you're not hostile to nature but you view it as

957
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:50,080
what I call wild potential it has the potential to be an amazing place for us it has all these

958
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:53,520
different building blocks and all these starting things and some of them we want to preserve

959
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:57,040
some of them we want to change a lot and even the things we want to preserve we want to make a

960
01:26:57,040 --> 01:27:02,880
lot more accessible to everyone which requires changing a lot so I think of it as we can do an

961
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:09,040
even better job at making the earth an amazing place to live but part of that is recognizing

962
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:14,080
we've done a really good job in a lot of ways the earth is so much of a better place to live than it

963
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:22,320
was 500 years ago 200 years ago the world is is is you know it's naturally uh it's naturally dynamic

964
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:26,880
it's deficient and it's dangerous it's like those are three attributes that's why I call it wild

965
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:32,480
potential and so human beings have had to contend with that and to bring up fossil fuels our basic

966
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:38,480
way of contending with that is to try to produce a lot of value that nature doesn't produce for us

967
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:42,720
nature produces not very much value that we can use and it produces a lot of threat so we need

968
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:48,400
productive ability to create resources nature doesn't including to create resources that neutralize

969
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:53,040
the different threats like creating irrigation to neutralize drought and what we do that with

970
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:58,240
our productive ability but we're naturally very physically weak beings and so the key step is

971
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:03,680
using machines to produce far more value than our meager physical bodies can and that's what we've

972
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:08,400
done with fossil fuels we've had cost effective energy that has allowed say the average american

973
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:14,240
to have 75 machine servants producing value so that we can do far more than we ever could

974
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:19,360
and we can do types of things that we never could like no number of human beings can fly

975
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:23,680
no number of human beings can be an incubator which you know save millions incubator save

976
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:29,200
millions of lives so we've made the earth so much of a better place and I think we can make it even

977
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:34,480
more beautiful and I think a lot of the specific things we create are ugly and that's a shame but

978
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:39,840
I think of it as we've done a good job and we can do even better not that we're these sinners who

979
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:45,600
have ruined who ruin everything by touching it that is a that is a hostile view and it's an unjustified

980
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:50,080
view so I think we can be more like Frank Lloyd Wright but we should be proud of what we've done

981
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:55,040
so far and in terms of obligation I mean I feel gratitude for it I don't feel like

982
01:28:55,040 --> 01:29:01,200
anyone has really sinned or I've sinned or but I feel like the obligation is to is to keep going

983
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:05,280
trying to make it better and better and I think just by being a productive person

984
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:09,760
that's really what you're doing but because I think about global issues I try to advise people

985
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:16,640
globally so let me ask you about this psychologically so obviously people there are a lot of people

986
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:21,920
particularly young people perhaps who are bearing a heavy load of existential guilt for the fact of

987
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:28,880
their very existence and so you just made something approximating a pro-human case and so I would ask

988
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:35,760
you a psychological question how do you think you've conducted yourself in your own life

989
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:43,920
effectively so that that sense of existential guilt that potential hostility towards human

990
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:49,280
endeavor itself or even human existence has been ameliorated like what have you done that you

991
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:56,000
believe is sufficiently valuable to justify the cost of your own existence but I guess

992
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:01,280
why would I I don't understand why I would feel it in the first place because the people who feel

993
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:05,360
it have a very warped at least the environmental version we can talk about other versions but

994
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:10,560
the environmental slash climate version is this very warped delicate nurture view of the earth

995
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:15,280
that the earth is stable sufficient and safe and our impact ruins it and if you believe that

996
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:20,640
and you hear all this propaganda then you think yeah we're all you we're all ruining the delicate

997
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:26,240
nurture but if you have that view it's a very damaging view but I don't have the view so I don't

998
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:30,880
understand why I would feel so bad yeah but people that's the thing is that and I think we need to

999
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:38,400
contend with this right because people do have that view and lots of people have it and it's easy

1000
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:43,520
let's say for educators who are pushing this ideological agenda to capitalize on the prevalence

1001
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:49,200
of that view that's why I'm pointing to something like an intrinsic sense of original sin is that

1002
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:53,360
we have this sense as human beings or many people do that in some real sense

1003
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:59,040
we have to atone for the crime of our existence and I think there's something to that I think that

1004
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:06,240
we have to bear a moral burden that justifies the the crime of our existence so to speak

1005
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:11,920
and that would mean that we have to be genuinely well in your terminology we have to be genuinely

1006
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:16,320
productive people let's say we have to be genuinely productive people that are aiming up

1007
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:21,520
maybe in relationship to such things as working for the amelioration of absolute poverty like

1008
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:27,520
there is a moral calling there and I think that part I think of it differently okay I think of it

1009
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:32,640
differently so I think of existence as an opportunity so I think of it as it's just this

1010
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:37,680
amazingly special thing that you know any of us exist in the first place I mean probably you

1011
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:42,400
think about the probabilistic nature of it and I feel like being on earth is just this amazing

1012
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:46,480
opportunity and you can look at how different people have handled that throughout history and

1013
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:51,120
how they handle it today and I think a lot of people tragically haven't made the most of it but I

1014
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:55,600
think you can see certain things that people do who have made the most of it and find it fulfilling

1015
01:31:55,600 --> 01:32:00,720
and for me one of the observations is people who choose a certain kind of creative work it

1016
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:04,720
it is makes a huge difference I'm guessing you've experienced I've certainly experienced this in

1017
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:10,400
terms of just finding something that creates value in the world that really really works with

1018
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:14,960
how you like to use your mind the thought process hopefully you get to work with certain kinds of

1019
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:20,400
people I mean that's just part of it there are all kinds of other opportunities of being alive so I

1020
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:25,440
don't think about it all as oh it's we're guilty and this is bad I think the only guilt is wasting

1021
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:30,720
the opportunity that's that's where my kind of fear and guilt come in is like I worry about oh did I

1022
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:35,120
waste the opportunity of being alive and part of that is of course you don't want to live at the

1023
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:40,240
expense of others and ruin the world that's another way of wasting it but so I think of life as

1024
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:46,000
opportunity not as not as atonement well right and we should also we could address there too the

1025
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:52,560
issue that if you conduct yourself successfully so let's say that you are as a consequence prosperous

1026
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:58,400
there is also this underlying presumption that's generally unexamined that you had to do that at

1027
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:03,280
someone else's expense right it's something like a zero sum game and that ties into this whole

1028
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:09,680
Malthusian view that were yeast in a petri dish with finite resources and the truth of the matter

1029
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:17,760
I think is that if you conduct yourself in the highest manner properly then you end up being

1030
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:23,840
creatively productive in a manner that doesn't just benefit you selfishly but simultaneously

1031
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:30,080
benefits many other people and also facilitates their ability to do the same thing and so that's

1032
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:35,600
a vision of a kind of harmony that's a high-order ethical calling is you don't have to pursue your

1033
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:43,760
creative exploitation of possibility at the cost of the possibility or at the cost of other people

1034
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:48,720
quite the contrary you could increase the possibility which we could do on the natural front

1035
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:54,640
and you could increase the ability of others to flourish simultaneously yes and I want to really

1036
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:59,920
highlight because earlier you responded you said all these people have been have been immersed

1037
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:04,640
in this what I call this dogma this delicate nurture dogma and I would add a piece to this

1038
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:09,600
dogma it's it's the view that the earth is delicate nurture that say stable sufficient and safe and

1039
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:14,480
then it goes along with what I call the parasite polluter view of human beings what you're getting

1040
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:19,120
out with the Malthusian view so the view that all we do with our impact is we take from the earth

1041
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:24,800
and we destroy it we make it ugly we disrupt it in this kind of thing and in so far as you view

1042
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:29,440
the world this way you are going to have a bad life and you're going to be really unhappy

1043
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:33,280
because you're going to feel really guilty and you're going to feel really pessimistic

1044
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:37,920
and you're going to believe in all of these apocalyptic scenarios so it's it's why it's a

1045
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:43,280
fundamental thing that needs to be done to reeducate people about the basic nature of earth

1046
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:49,120
and the basic nature of human beings and replace so delicate nurture with what I call wild potential

1047
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:54,640
and this parasite polluter view with what I call the producer improve our view we actually produce

1048
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:59,920
value and we can improve the earth and we can do even more and in fossil future I talk about this

1049
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:04,560
as part of the human flourishing framework a key part of how we have to think about this issue

1050
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:11,040
is change our view of human beings and earth from an anti-human view to a pro-human view and if once

1051
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:15,120
you change that in people it is life changing because it's their their whole view of how the

1052
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:20,880
world works changes from this terribly sad and destructive view to a very optimistic view and

1053
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:26,080
that that's one of the things I'm grateful for is early on I learned pro-human environmental

1054
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:31,920
philosophy and that was a huge gift that I got when I was 18 how did you learn that why were you

1055
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:36,560
fortunate enough to learn that well maybe we'll leave that look we have to stop we have to stop

1056
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:41,760
this part of it we'll get into that in the next part of our discussion so for everybody who's

1057
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:48,160
watching and listening I do an extra half an hour with my guests on the daily wire plus platform

1058
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:53,840
as part of the arrangement that I've made with them to increase the professional appearance and

1059
01:35:53,840 --> 01:36:00,960
quality of my podcasts for example which as you are noticing are still available on YouTube free

1060
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:05,840
for wide distribution I do an extra half an hour with people I would be interested and I'm going

1061
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:15,200
to continue to talk to to elix on the daily wire plus platform about his philosophical journey

1062
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:21,360
because you've definitely taken an unpopular stance and a minority unpopular stance and you

1063
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:26,960
did that pretty early 2014 is pretty early given all things considered and and you did it quite

1064
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:32,080
successfully you haven't been particularly effectively cancelled interestingly enough

1065
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:38,000
and I'd like to find out what your pathway was to your realizations and how you manage that

1066
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:44,400
hello everyone I would encourage you to continue listening to my conversation with my guest

1067
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:50,400
