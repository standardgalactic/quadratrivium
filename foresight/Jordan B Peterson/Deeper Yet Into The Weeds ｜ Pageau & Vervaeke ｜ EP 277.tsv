0	7040	One of the things I really found striking about Tammy is like she did a very detailed picture of my daughter's surgical wound
7040	11840	And that's not an easy thing to look at right because you don't want to look at that
11840	15320	But that also ties in with the ideas we've been discussing about well
15320	19120	I think that's the with the mystery. Yes mystery of the crucifix. You bet right
19120	24760	Yeah, all these images that we have like the beauty of Christ wounds all these things which sound so completely
25920	29240	Pathological yeah to many people if you can understand them properly
29240	32320	You can understand that that you have to gaze on that which most threatens
45280	51040	So, hello everyone, I'm pleased here pleased today to have with me
52120	54120	Jonathan Pazio and John Verveke
55120	59600	People that most of you many of you not all of you will be familiar with I
61680	63680	I've been working on a new book
64200	68400	entitled we who wrestle with God and it's been influenced by
69400	71400	Jonathan's ideas and
71560	73560	John's ideas and I
74160	81960	Developed an argument in part as a consequence of the public lectures. I've been doing for the last three months trying to push my ideas farther and I
82800	84240	I I
84240	86240	Put forward a set of
86480	93160	Propositions that I'm basing one of the book chapters on I wrote it as an outline and then I think it's solid
93160	99280	I've been testing it when I've been speaking at universities as well to diverse audiences of specialists
99280	103820	To see if they'll object to it because I think it's actually quite radical and I sent this group of
104840	111360	Propositions or this list of propositions to Jonathan and John a month ago about and we've been going back and forth
111960	116760	And I thought I heard Jonathan was coming to town to do a talk with John and I thought hey
116760	118760	that's a good opportunity we could get together and
119200	125320	Walk through these propositions because I'd like to see if if they're solid because if they're solid
125600	126520	Well, that's good
126520	130440	And if they're not I'd like to find out and so we're gonna do this a little different
130720	133200	This is gonna be a little different than many of the conversations
133200	137800	I've had because it'll have a bit more structure and I I want to read the propositions
137800	143520	There's I think about 15 of them and I want Jonathan and and John to
145280	147360	Comment on them to
147360	149640	Tell me where they agree to tell me where they disagree
150040	155400	Tell me what they don't understand and to see if I can well learn something as a consequence
155400	159600	That's kind of the whole and so we'll start with this first proposition
161680	163680	To see the world
163920	165920	We must must
166920	168920	Prioritize our perceptions
169880	171280	so
171280	178000	John I'll ask you about that first because that's a particular I believe a particular focus of yours
178000	182960	I don't think that's an exaggeration. No, it's not. That's that's that's the core of my work
184040	185680	and so
185680	187680	the main
187880	190640	Way I would respond to this is I would say
191120	196720	I think the work that's coming out from artificial intelligence and the work that's coming out from attention
197280	202640	Lines up with this very well. I don't have any significant disagreement with that proposition
202640	204840	And and the must part of it as well
206360	210280	So the must I took well, let me tell you how I took yes, yeah
210280	213680	And I took it as what's called constitutive necessity
213680	217000	I took it to be if you are going to be a cognitive agent
217480	220600	Then you must do this. I didn't take it to be a metaphysical
221360	223960	Necessity I took it to be that kind of constituent necessity
223960	230440	I think it's useful to start with what you described as constituent necessities before you move into the realm of metaphysical
230440	236680	Exactly, I think that's a good way to argue you should all right and so I think and I'm not going to
238600	242800	Recapitulate all these arguments, but a lot of work. I think zero is in on the idea
243680	250280	That the core of what makes us intelligent and the thing that we're finding difficult to give to machines to make them
250760	258200	Artificially general intelligence is a process. I call relevance realization, which is exactly I think lines up with this very well
258280	265080	The amount of information available to you in the world is astronomically vast all the things you could pay attention to
265440	267640	The amount of information in your long-term memory
267760	271680	Especially if you think of all the ways it could be combined is also
271840	277600	Astronomically the number of options of potential lines of behavior. I could move this finger this finger
277600	281560	I could move them like a lift like you and the ways I can move around that's combinatorial
281560	285560	Explosion all of it all of it and then right and then you can also consider
285640	290520	You know all of the options of different pit of potential worlds
290520	297440	You might want to consider trying to produce or moving into right and so the point is in many different dimensions
297640	300520	We face combinatorial explosion and what's
301720	306720	What you can't do and this is where it lines up with the most because we're finite beings
306720	310640	Yes, the finite resources and finite time is you can't check all of that information
310640	315280	So you can't go and say no, that's not relevant. That's not relevant that memory is not relevant
315280	322000	That will take like that's the the rest of the history of the universe right right, so so we don't know how we do it
322000	324480	In fact because of that in part. Well, I mean, I think
325200	330640	I think there's getting some clues towards it, but we can talk about that later. Okay, right?
330640	336920	So the must and the prioritization on the perception side you're fine with it has to be it has to be and here
336920	339420	But here's the tricky thing which is
340720	347280	The fact that we can't check it means and this sounds almost like a Zen coin is the prioritization is odd
347920	350160	when you say it sort of like
350760	355200	Primaficia, yeah, because it means we intelligently ignore
356000	361040	Most of the information right prioritizing the what I want to put yeah, that's a good codicilies
361040	368360	So you're saying that you don't want to misinterpret the necessity for prioritization as our as something like
368920	375960	The necessity or our ability to make a numbered list of exactly number of possibilities that lay out in front of us
375960	382840	Because that's actually impossible right so so that isn't how we do it. However, we do it isn't that exactly so when you when when if
383080	385800	If you're okay with that reading and it sounds like you are
386600	391760	Prioritization doesn't mean what we normally mean by prioritization where we set things out
392440	400760	Explicit and focal and then choose right great. It's implicit. It's implicit and it's self-organizing and our ability to think and it's unconscious
400760	402280	Yes emerges out of it
402680	409080	We can influence it top down but because it is an absolute requirement for our cognition
409560	415320	I would argue that our ability to do anything that we do consciously is ultimately dependent on it and right
416040	420680	Okay, fine. So that's good Jonathan. Well, I think the only thing that I would add is
421720	425240	You have to phrase it in a certain way. There's no you have to have a sense
425720	427720	But there's a sense in with perception
427960	430280	When we say we must prioritize our perceptions
430360	434600	I I think the best way to understand is that perception is already prioritization
434920	436920	It is to in order to perceive
436920	441320	That has to be a hierarchy in itself the perception is in and of itself
442360	444360	it an act of
444600	446600	Implicit prioritization
446600	448200	And to use the word implicit will be a good idea
448200	453640	So to avoid the idea that we are consciously doing it that in order to even perceive the world there already has to be
454440	456440	a given hierarchy that is
456600	463160	That is making you able to focus on anything because yeah, or else we would be lost in a in a way as you know
463240	465240	A sea of infinite details
465240	470600	Okay, so I think that's a good cortisol. And so we could also make a little technical case here quickly
471320	474360	So part of the problem that John John referred to is that
474920	478040	In some sense, it's the problem of the finite confronting the infinite
478120	480760	And so we could make a neurological argument for that
480760	487560	So for example when you move your eyes around or when they move around as a consequence of being directed by unconscious
488200	490840	Structures of prioritization because that happens all the time
492360	499080	You move your eyes around because you want to direct the high resolution part of your visual system to whatever you're attending to
499560	503720	That's the fovea and the fovea is a very small part of your retina and
504600	506360	It's a very high resolution part
506360	511080	So each cell in the fovea is connected at the level of the primary visual cortex
511560	515560	To 10,000 cells and then each of those have 10,000 connections
515880	519960	And so if your whole vision was foveal in its
520600	525800	Um in its resolution you'd have to have a skull like an alien to contain that much brain
525880	531080	And so so so and that's a real indication of that finitude right is that you do have
531640	534040	limited cognitive resources and limited means
534680	537240	Practically and physically limited, but it also means
538120	542280	Metabolically limited the the cost of running your brain is already extremely high
542840	544040	and
544040	546760	And so you're going to shepherd your available
547560	553960	attentional resources because they are finite and and they're finite in no small part because they are technically
554840	556360	metabolically
556360	558840	Costly that all seems okay
559720	565400	So I would add one thing to that which is I would put an emphasis on how this process has to be self-organizing
565720	567720	because we want to avoid
567800	571080	A perennial problem, which you and I both know shows up in psychology
571320	573320	Which is to posit the internal homunculus
573720	579320	That actually doesn't explain the problem, but just shifts the central executive is an example of this etc
579560	586840	So we don't we we don't want to say that there's someone that's doing the prioritization because that someone is just as mysterious
586920	593640	Right and is facing the very problem that we're trying to explain. So yeah, right the process has to be dynamically so far
593880	595880	Well, one of the ways I
596680	598440	realized
598440	604600	How that problem works is in an attempt to solve the mind-body problem because you can't solve the mind-body problem
605080	608280	But you can say let's say you're you want to
609000	611800	Explore an idea and you decide to do that by writing an essay
612040	615560	So then you sit down in front of the computer, which is not an idea
615800	619400	It's actually that you're sitting and then you move your fingers on the keyboard
619480	625640	And so there's a hierarchy of transformation from mind which might be the abstract intent to body
625960	629880	And so and so that the spirit hits the body in the finger movements
630200	636280	And then the spirit disappears in some sense under the finger movements because you can move your fingers voluntarily
636440	641720	But you have no idea what muscles you're moving to do that and you can't control the cells or anything like that
641880	645800	Oh, I did that with my students in the lecture this morning. I was talking about
646600	649160	This very fact that I said, uh, put up your finger
649880	655560	Okay, bend your finger. What do you do to bend your finger? Right exactly. Exactly. It's so interesting
656280	661960	It's so interesting that you have that level of consciousness at that level of detail, which is pretty detailed
662200	668680	But no more than that. Yes. Yes. Yeah. So that's a mystery man that that that that localization of consciousness
669640	674040	Between the body and part of the spirit. There's like a there's like a what would you call it? Uh
674600	678360	There's a bandwidth. There's a bandwidth of resolution for consciousness. Yes
678440	685640	And why that band see the social psychologists who studied language are caught into this because one of the things they realized was that
686200	689320	Short words first of all short words tend to be old words
689960	693880	So because as language develops words that are used a lot get more efficient
694440	700760	But the short words also map extraordinarily well onto the self evident level of perception
701160	704280	and so for example a short word is cat because
706120	708120	A cat presents itself
708120	712520	For some reason to our perception the species cat doesn't and the
713080	717640	The fur of the cat in some sense doesn't it's the cat. Yes, and and you can see that
718440	725320	Primary object record level recognition basic level basic level. That's right. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. And so you see that with
725800	727800	Babies because they get
727960	735480	Doggy pretty damn fast and that that's because the language maps on to the primary domain of perception that basic level perception
735800	739240	Quite nicely and that is associated with something like the natural
739880	746840	Bandwidth of consciousness. Yeah, I would I would say that that lines up with if you rush his explanation
747480	753640	Is you know, you're getting the best trade-off between differences between category and similarities within categories, right?
753640	761320	And then the question is what this best trade-off means exactly and that's and for me that's that's what that would that be a little bit of
762760	764760	I guess a nuance I'd want to put on to
765480	768360	The prioritization because the prioritization sounds
769080	771400	very but sort of like an imposition
772280	777720	Whereas I think what we're talking about is something more like what maro ponte talked about when he talked about optimal gripping
778280	780520	Right. So what's what's the correct?
781640	783320	You know distance to look at this
783320	788680	Well, it depends because if I zoom in I lose the gestalt if I zoom out I lose the detail that depends on what you want to do
788840	792840	Exactly. Well, that's it. That's why I'm kind of attracted to pragmatism
792840	798040	It's like well to some degree our theories of truth need to be embedded in the practicalities of action
798120	804280	And so is that a grippable object that I can drink from while I want my perception to match that problem
805160	808920	Yeah, but it doesn't I think that it if you understand that the prioritization
809720	813560	The thing that you have heaven and earth. I'm going to use sorry. I'm going to use mythical categories. But so you have
815480	817480	You have heaven and earth and that
817960	822040	It's the way in which heaven meets earth is a it's a mutual relationship, right?
822040	824680	We always see it as a relationship of lovers you could say
824920	828520	But it's not the the prioritization isn't just about an imposition from above
828520	831640	But it's about the manner in which that which is above let's say the
832200	838200	The hierarchy is able to encounter the potential on which it's we were talking about that last night
838280	842680	So jonathan made this funny joke last night. We were talking about sam harris and sam harris has this
843640	845640	Uh line of argumentation
845880	851000	Where and he used this on me where I interpreted a biblical story and then he interpreted a recipe
851160	854600	Yes, and he said well look at all the interpretations and that is a problem of
855240	862200	Of semiotic drift. Yes. Well, it's also a problem of this horizon of infinite possibility. There are multiple interpretive schemes
862600	864600	So jonathan said he'd like to do a video
865160	869800	Where he shows that a recipe is actually necessarily embedded inside a mythological framework
869800	871960	And we started to talk about that because imagine
872440	874440	Well, the recipe implies
874760	880680	That you need to make an edible meal that you want to make an edible meal that you're going to serve it to family
880680	884520	And friends that that's part of a kind of communion that you think that's a good thing
884600	887880	That's worth spending time on that serves your family and friends
888120	891800	That's maybe nested in something like an ethic of service to the community
891800	894440	Like there's a whole there's a whole network of purpose
894520	896120	I would add more to that
896120	900680	There's all kinds of implicit assumptions that I can capture in a sequence of propositions
901240	907560	Procedural skills that are not completely capturable in words and that those procedures and skills can also map on
907880	909880	Through the particular virtues and skill
910120	912280	You know that that people are bringing to like
913000	915000	it's like
915320	921400	Most things can't be solved by a recipe and right right and yet so a recipe is a
922200	926600	significant cognitive cultural achievement and we don't recognize like and and and
927400	933320	We we we we tend to over generalize the things we think for which we can provide recipes. This is one of the right
933480	937480	That's an algorithm issue. Yes, exactly. Exactly. And so there's lots
937880	939880	Yeah, even in the recipe itself
939960	945160	You will notice that the way in which we name things and the way in which we order things will be related to a normal
945480	947240	prioritization hierarchy prioritization
947320	951320	But if you're making chicken you'll have the chicken and then you'll have the spices
951480	955320	And you'll understand that these elements that i'm adding are spices and that they're there
955480	959080	Let's say something like a marginalia that i'm adding to the central meal
959240	962920	It's actually the very it's like it's the pattern of a church actually, you know where you have
963400	966600	A movement towards the central identity that we understand and then we have
967240	972600	The way in which it's complemented to other things and so even the actual recipe itself is like a little
972920	977320	Microphone and also the judgment you use is like well, how much spice well the answer is
977880	980360	Well, what function is this spice going to serve and you say well
980360	983080	I want to add a little zest and interest
983400	988200	To my cooking and so then you have a philosophy of zest and interest that's associated with that because
988600	990440	Just predictable chicken isn't good enough
990440	995000	And maybe you want to put a little more spice on because you want to uh, what would you say you want to
995720	1000600	Challenge your guests a little bit in an interesting way and you're thinking this all through and for the same reason
1000600	1004440	You'd wear funny socks or a tie that has just a little bit too much on it, you know
1004920	1008600	Well, it seems I mean that's actually the future of general problem solving
1008920	1014360	Like you when people are solving a problem, especially if they might get the wrong frame
1014840	1019960	Moderately distracting you from the central concern is an optimal way. Yeah, exactly. You need to do that
1020040	1026840	So so what I'm hearing both of you say is the prioritization is really a multi-dimensional optimal gripping
1027320	1032920	That's right. That's right. We're concentrating on okay. Well, then that we can also expand on that to some degree because
1033720	1035720	multi-dimensional and optimal
1036200	1041960	Brings a lot of other concerns into it. So imagine that one of the principles and and can't can't
1043640	1048040	Move towards this with this theory of universal ethic in some sense, although I think it
1048760	1050840	You know I hesitate to criticize can't because but
1052280	1057080	I think that there's a deeper explanation for what he observes is well, how should I treat you?
1057640	1061880	Well, that's a complex question. But one of the constraints is well
1062920	1064920	What if we meet a hundred times?
1065400	1070600	So we're going to establish an actual relationship. So however, I conduct myself in the present moment
1071400	1072520	has to
1072600	1077640	Be in accordance with a value hierarchy that takes into account the desirability of our mutual
1078600	1083160	Interrelationship into the future and that produces a very serious series of I would say
1083720	1088440	Often intrinsic constraints. So I can't be too insulting. I can't be too unwelcoming
1088440	1093960	I have to offer you something approximating a true reciprocity for the thing not to degenerate
1094440	1099560	And so and all of that and I would say that also governs how you cook for someone if you actually want to make friends
1099960	1103160	So it's like treat other people as you would like them to treat you
1103560	1109720	And it's pretty funny that that's the intrinsic ethic in a recipe. And so that's a good that's a that's such a funny argument
1110760	1114120	We'll get right back to Jonathan Peugeot and John Verbecki in just a moment
1114440	1122760	First we'd like to tell you about Elysium health founded by Dr. Leonard Garante a renowned mit researcher and 30 year student of the science of aging

1197160	1199160	Okay, so let's move to the second
1201080	1202920	presupposition
1202920	1204200	To act in the world
1204200	1209160	So it's kind of a corollary or the first or something equivalent to act in the world. We must prioritize our actions
1209240	1211720	I don't think we probably have to cover that right because it's
1212280	1218040	Perception is an action already because you have to move your eyes and orient your head and also gripping is an action
1218120	1222120	Yes, exactly. So I think that goes with it. Yeah, okay. So so we'll leave that well, okay
1222600	1227240	Now this is the next this is a nice switch. I think any system of priorities
1229000	1235400	Is a structure of values and then I sneak something in an ethic. So I'm kind of defining ethic as a
1235480	1241240	Something approximating perhaps an internally. It's like a game. It's an internally consistent
1242440	1247160	Hierarchy of value, but it's also it's going to have to be iterable in the sense that we already discussed
1247160	1252120	So that's kind of what I'm defining an ethic as and then you could also think of it as something that's embodied
1252520	1258040	So when you're watching someone on a screen in a movie say a character, they embody an ethic
1258120	1261720	That's what makes them interesting. It's a whole structure of value
1262280	1268120	And they're acting it out and it's a system of priorities of perception and action
1268680	1273000	And that's a value structure. The reason it's a value structure is because well, what's the difference between
1273800	1275800	prioritization and value
1276280	1282760	You you prioritize what you value and so I think the difficulty I have is if you use the word ethic because the word ethic is so
1283320	1284520	charged with
1284520	1285800	Morality and also
1285800	1288360	To the way that we're supposed to act between each other
1288440	1293000	Then I think it it can be a little bit misleading because values and why is good
1293080	1297640	It seems to well, I think good is fine. That is the good in the sense that there's also a good glass
1297640	1301480	Which has no moral bearing at all. There's a there's a good way to walk down the hall
1301480	1306920	Which is not a moral question. There's a you know, they're good way to fish, but these are not ethical ethical
1307160	1311960	Maybe they are maybe yeah, maybe but I think that that's maybe the little place where I would wonder about
1311960	1315320	Yeah, so that that's a terminological problem in some sense, right? Well, it is
1315480	1320440	I don't know. What do you think that it seems that the word ethic seems to imply interpersonal relationships
1320680	1326040	Yeah, the word ethic has been reduced to the the moral interactions ethical. Yes. Yes, whereas
1326840	1335240	Typically philosophers will use the term normativity to be a much more general term for cover for the idea that there's a governing principle
1335320	1337320	for your behavior
1337880	1341080	Okay, so I I'll have to make sure I clarified that when I read about this
1341080	1346920	But I was also thinking about, you know common fictional tropes in popular culture. So
1348120	1349960	If you're watching a mafia
1349960	1355960	Movie one of the things that's interesting about a mafia criminal as opposed to just your ordinary criminal is
1356520	1358520	That he's not entirely chaotic
1358920	1363080	Right. He abides by the mafia code. So he's loyal to his
1364200	1369160	Yeah, he's loyal to a code. So it makes him a quasi-ethic actor and I would say well the mafia
1369480	1375320	Character does embody an ethic and I'm kind of struggling for a word that isn't ethic
1376200	1379480	You might disagree with the ethical but I think it's because I mean
1379480	1382760	I think you can actually take this a lot further than than just a mafia person
1382760	1386840	I think there's a way that you can be a good mass murderer
1387400	1389480	that in the sense that you can you can
1390360	1395240	You have discovered the hierarchy of values things you need to value in order to become a good mass murderer
1395480	1398360	And now you're engaging in them towards that
1398840	1402840	Hierarchy of values. There is like you could say like there are satanic hierarchies like the
1403560	1408200	Columbine killers, for example, we're doing exactly that and most of the mass shooters
1408760	1411640	There's a contest going on. Yeah, they know about each other
1411720	1417480	They're often in fact one of them one kid who was planning to do this wrote me like six months ago
1417720	1424360	He had a 50 page manifesto ready and the weapons and he watched this this youtube video
1424600	1428120	Discussion I did with Warren Farrell and where we touched on this issue
1428360	1434680	And he decided that there was seriously something wrong with him and that he should get some help and not do this
1434840	1439160	But he was in contact with one of the people who went out and shot up a high school
1439480	1444760	They'd been contact online. So he was like that far away from it. Yeah, but that's so so there is this
1445480	1447480	It's not a
1447480	1451960	You can have a chaotic criminal who's completely unpredictable, but then you don't have much of a plot, right?
1451960	1455800	He's not an interesting character. He's gonna get caught really fast. Well, there's that too, right?
1456120	1460760	The far more interesting ones have a they haven't well, I'd say they have an ethic now
1460760	1462040	It's not an ethical ethic, right?
1462040	1467880	So that's why the word ethic is difficult because you could say that ultimately what you're gonna what's gonna happen is that there will be
1468440	1474440	A hierarchy of value systems. Yeah, we'll be more related to the good in the in the classical sense that is played out
1474520	1479560	Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Exactly. And this is Plato's argument that nobody willingly does evil
1479720	1482680	Everybody does what they conceive to be a good in some fact
1482680	1489240	Yeah, you see that in Dante you see the same is whole movement. He even talks about how the people inhale everybody is there because of
1489320	1491720	I'm reading the divine comedy right now. That's wonderful. Yeah, that's great
1492200	1494600	Everybody who is there is there because of love
1495160	1499400	For a good even though even if they love the good too much or they're mistaken about
1499640	1501960	Let's say the actual ultimate value of that good
1502360	1506280	Everybody moves towards a good even if you're doing something which is completely reprehensible
1506440	1512680	Yeah, the proposal that sin is actually failing to love wisely. Yeah, that's the don't you see that I have
1512840	1516520	I have some problem with that viewpoint because I think I think that happens
1516600	1519080	I do think that happens and I think many of the
1519480	1524440	You know, I've talked to people like my friend Greg Hurwitz who writes thrillers and he crafts pretty evil characters
1524520	1526520	And we've talked about that a lot
1527240	1531800	An evil character with an ethic so like a misplaced love is is a very interesting character
1531800	1536200	But then there's the other sorts of characters that are more cane like because cane
1537320	1540520	His spirit that the spirit that's expressed in that story
1541800	1543800	his
1543960	1547000	He isn't aiming at something that's good. He's aiming at
1547800	1550760	Getting away with lying to god. He's aiming at getting away with making
1551480	1555800	Insufficient sacrifices. He's aiming at getting away eventually with murder
1556280	1561560	It's not a perversion of the good and I think that we underestimate the problem of evil if we assume
1561880	1566840	That it's merely a consequence of worshiping false idols say because the idol can be so
1567080	1573000	It's like I talked to you last night about the reports that michelle fuko rape boys in graveyards. It's like
1573640	1574840	okay
1574840	1576680	He argued even formally
1576680	1582600	Culturally to abolish or at least radically reduce the age of consent and a lot of intellectuals went along with them
1582840	1587560	And maybe you can have a discussion about that and what the age of consent could be and maybe you can't
1587640	1590200	there's room for differences in opinion there, but
1591080	1595560	When your pedophilia involves graveyard sex
1596280	1598280	Then that's not a misplaced good
1598520	1601960	Like that's that's that's but why not george. Why why isn't that
1603000	1605000	Pleasure is a good
1605000	1607000	Right and and well, it's so specific
1608040	1611160	You know, why the graveyard like there's something so dark
1611320	1615880	I don't think there's I think that's a place that's so dark that you can't go there without knowing that it's dark
1616200	1619080	And I do think that I really do believe and you know
1619160	1624760	I've done my best to study the thought of people who've done truly reprehensible things is that there's a level of
1625400	1632440	Reprehensibility where you are going there to cause the most trouble you can't and I don't see
1633160	1637160	If there's any good left in that it's such a tiny really gonna be like that
1637240	1639560	I'm really gonna be the devil's advocate here knowing that
1640280	1643960	There are some that do it better than others and some that don't do it as well
1644360	1649880	Even recognizing that the good that they're aiming towards is is not really transcendentally
1649960	1651960	Their memory has to be working their problems
1651960	1656680	Right, that is that they that it's like if I yeah, so they're still driven by a coherent spirit
1656760	1660200	Well, that's what I think the spirit of lucifer and this and the spirit of girth is
1661080	1666280	Mephistopheles that's that's and the spirit of cane. That's a description of that ethic
1666520	1669400	It does you know it is it is a coherent personality
1669640	1671960	And that's why there's so much well and Milton as well
1672040	1679080	It's it's there's been an attempt to delineate the ethic of evil and and it's not merely chaotic
1679240	1682360	And the reason one of the reasons why it's important and maybe it's hard to
1682920	1685320	To see that right away, but one of the reasons why it's important
1685640	1690040	At least I find it important to formulate it this way the way the Dante formulated it or that Plato
1690440	1693400	Formulated it is that if you don't go in this direction
1693720	1697960	You end up with a dualism and then they end up acting as like two opposites
1698360	1703800	Whereas there's the the more platonic way of setting it up what ends up happening is that
1704520	1708440	The evil always ends up just being a perversion of the good right is parasitic
1709080	1715320	It's always parasitic and so what what it does is that it makes the good truly good and it makes it all pervasive
1715560	1718040	And a way in which it can actually fill up the entire
1718920	1723480	Cosmos, you know the this idea that even in the death of hell the love of god is there
1723560	1727800	Like you see that in a lot of the christian mystic that there is no place that is
1728200	1733320	Okay, so let me ask you about that on the grounds of christian theology
1733800	1737320	So and I'm probably going to mangle this and so correct me
1737640	1742360	Well, there's an idea that in the book of revelation that christ is the eternal judge
1742440	1746360	but that he's also a judge who comes back at the end of days and
1747080	1752360	Separates the wheat from the chaff the damned from the saved and the implication in that
1753000	1754760	book is that
1754760	1760120	Many are called but few are chosen the judgment's pretty damn harsh and most
1761400	1767720	Most what most spirits are damned most people are damned and then is that eternal or is there a
1768840	1772280	reconciliation and so I don't know the answer to that so the
1772760	1774280	Christian
1774680	1776680	The best way
1776680	1777800	This is gonna
1777800	1779480	This is the type of thing that could actually get me in trouble
1779480	1781880	But like the best way to formulate it
1781880	1787160	I think that we're seeing in the orthodox tradition right now is to say that we live in the hope of
1787800	1789640	Of a final restoration
1789640	1793240	But that we cannot universal redemption, but we cannot posit it because
1794200	1798920	You like you said there are seems to be there seem to be two traditions in the christian world
1799240	1802760	There is a tradition of final restoration which you find in revelation as well
1802760	1806760	By the way, because it says the last thing to die is death itself right there
1806840	1808840	There's the sense of death is thrown into the fire
1808920	1814680	And so the last what exactly is that referring to the the sense in which the heavenly druslim descends and embodies
1815000	1821400	Fills up the entire world. So you have these images and then you also have an image of evil being completely
1822120	1824840	Let's say cast off and those two kind of exist in a
1825160	1831880	Yeah, well, it's it's I was thinking this about just the other day when I was thinking about making a video address to
1832600	1835640	Do the islamic world as preposterous as that might sound
1837000	1841480	Because one of the things you want to do when you're talking to people is you want to distinguish between
1842040	1848200	them as of intrinsic value and redeemable in some final sense just as you are and
1848680	1855560	Ideas that might be possessing them that have either this misplaced good element to them or this vengeful element and so
1856680	1859080	You know, you don't want to throw to use a horrible cliche
1859160	1861160	You don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water
1861160	1864120	And so maybe the separation of the wheat from the chaff is
1864600	1868680	A spiritual discrimination that doesn't throw out the entire
1869160	1874520	Being along with the judgment you understand it fractally then I think that that makes sense
1875400	1880280	If you read like for example, c.s. Lewis is a great example of someone who kind of was going in that direction
1880280	1887000	Was hinting at some things he talked about how like the this notion that the key to hell is hell is locked from the inside
1887480	1888760	right
1888760	1895160	No matter even like I think c.s. Lewis said like even in the depth of in the depth of hell if satan wanted
1895560	1901000	To repent there's well that's what Milton said but that's not but that's not it's like it's not happening because that's the role
1901400	1904920	That's in the story. This is the character that helped me understand this
1905400	1906200	part of
1906200	1910360	The cosmos that or the part of the way that the world is laying itself out and you see that
1910920	1914280	In in in some of the syrian fathers for example said that from the syrian
1914280	1920600	He he says things like that where he says there's the the fire in hell is the same fire that was at pentacos
1921160	1923160	The fire in hell is the love of god
1923640	1929160	And it's and it's and it's it's only that to the extent that you refuse to be transformed
1929160	1931960	Yeah, and you hold on to your let's say
1932520	1939400	Parasitic good that is what the fire hell well right well part of that is is that as you become more divorced from
1939880	1944520	Let's say what constitutes a sustainable and valid good the farther you get away from that
1944840	1949240	Whether it's merely by pursuing a misplaced good or it's by conscious design
1949800	1951080	the more that
1951080	1958040	Elevates itself up as the harshest possible judge that will do the most damage to your current ethic and then
1958120	1960520	destabilize your whole perceptions and so
1961240	1963480	That's so interesting because as you deviate
1964600	1966840	Speaking spiritually as you deviate from god
1966920	1967960	He becomes more
1967960	1973880	tyrannical in in some sense to you and more judgmental and it's also partly because this is why the catholic
1974920	1979800	idea of confession is isn't what's often pilloried because you know people laugh
1980120	1986040	Well, you're a catholic you can sin your whole life and on your deathbed you can repent. It's like yeah, but you have to
1986120	1989800	Face the magnitude of everything you did wrong
1990440	1995480	So repentance isn't just well. I'm sorry. It's like you're actually sorry
1995880	1999400	And if you've stacked up a whole lifetime of a lifetime of sins
1999880	2006440	What makes you think that you're going to have the moral wherewithal on your deathbed to confront that without anything
2007160	2013160	Well, it's just absolute existential terror is so it's there's no easy out from that so
2013880	2015880	So
2019480	2021480	I mean, I thought the discussion was
2022200	2025800	um important um and and what you just said jordan is important I I
2026360	2032600	I I for I for one who would not look want immortality because when I look back at the foolishness and
2033160	2035160	And the vices of my past
2035400	2036760	um
2036760	2039720	Yeah, it's it's it's hard. It's and so
2039800	2045480	Um people who think they could just sort of sin and mouth. I don't mouth the repentance
2045480	2049480	I don't think that's well. They also think they can in some sense pull one over god
2049560	2057000	Yeah, but or we could we'll abide by this rule that will never use religious language week when we can use any other kind of language
2057080	2064280	No, no, no, I know I know you weren't objecting to that. I think it's a good principle. I'm happy. I'm happy to talk about it
2065080	2067080	I I I'll but I don't
2067480	2069000	um
2069000	2070600	Well, let me say
2070600	2073480	There's there's something underneath the religious discussion
2074280	2078440	That is sort of a central concern to me at this point. Um
2079080	2081080	And I'll invoke caught
2081160	2083880	Um caught right the three critiques
2084520	2090360	Right the critique of pure reason practical reason judgment, right and and and Habermas makes a great point of this
2090440	2092440	I'm coming to it. I'm coming to the point which is
2093160	2098440	We don't seem since caught we don't have an integrated normativity
2099160	2102360	We have three autonomous spheres of normativity
2103000	2105000	Around the true the epistemic
2105560	2112280	The good and the beautiful and what what what caught did and one of the problems of modernity and this is Habermas's point
2112680	2114680	Is he made a very strong case
2114680	2120680	For the autonomy of each right beauty is beauty. So that's partly why you objected in the way you did when you emailed me back
2120760	2127800	Exactly you I was talking about an ethic that would unite and you said well, it's differentiated true beautiful and good
2128040	2132200	Right my my response to that would be something like well, whatever god is
2133320	2138440	Fundamentally ineffable. So we'll we'll make that yeah, we'll make that clear to begin with
2139000	2139800	but
2139800	2141160	I would say that
2141160	2147400	One way of thinking about the way we think about god is that god is what's common to the good the true and the beautiful
2147720	2152440	So this gets us into the the the the discussion that I think is for me
2153320	2155560	sort of the deepest levels of the phenomenology
2156120	2158120	And the cognition which is I mean that
2158600	2163240	Jonathan would know this is the classical doctrine the classical way of putting this is the convertible of the
2163640	2166200	The the the transcendentals are convertible into each other
2166440	2172760	So somehow the true and the good and and and the beautiful are one but not mathematical identity
2172840	2176120	This is really important. It's not right you can write and so
2176680	2182600	And you know the coinus wrestles with this max. I've been reading maximus, but I think you see a reflection of that in the idea
2182600	2188920	The trinity too, of course, right and and and and so the issue there is
2190840	2195480	And I've been reading DC Schindler on the Catholicity of reason and he talks about this he gets it from baltazar
2195560	2198280	he talks about the primacy of
2200280	2207080	The primacy of beauty the centrality of goodness and the ultimacy of truth that that they they are superlative but in different ways
2207560	2211800	So what he means by that is there's a primacy to beauty and and this is a classic platonic argument
2212280	2215720	If you don't have beauty all the other normativities are not available to you, right?
2216680	2218680	so why right
2219640	2226120	I wrote a chapter in my last book on the necessity of beauty, but but I don't understand why that why prime why primary
2226920	2231880	Because and what does that say about our perception that it's primary and so right because you don't have to think about it
2232040	2234200	Is that part of it? Is that you apprehend it?
2234600	2237160	I don't understand well a way of thinking about it is
2237560	2241560	scarry wrote a really beautiful book called beauty and how it prepares us for truth and justice
2242120	2247880	And the idea so let let's let's let's take let's take something that's that's very culturally relevant
2247880	2250280	And I've something I've been talking about so we we are
2250920	2254600	We are immersed in what recur called a hermeneutics of suspicion
2255160	2261960	The hermeneutics of suspicion is that appearances are always distorting distracting deceiving us from reality
2262040	2265480	That's the hermeneutics of suspicion and the moment of truth is when you reveal
2266200	2270280	The hidden cabal the conspiracy, right? This is the hermeneutics of suspicion
2270600	2274280	And it's you know, and and and recur's point is we got this that's what Freud does
2275000	2277000	Freud and it's the uncovering
2277560	2282120	Here's what's really going on in the deconstruction is here's what's read exactly. It's everywhere now
2282600	2288120	Right. Okay. Now. Yeah. Yeah. Now. Here's marlapunty's point about this, right? His point is but wait
2288680	2290680	the hermeneutics
2290680	2297640	Of that the hermeneutics of suspicion is always dependent on this if I say that's unreal. Oh, look
2298360	2300360	I do that because I say that's real
2300920	2304920	Realization is always a comparative judgment. This is his point
2305560	2311000	So the and so does he accept the notion that there is something because one of the things you see in the post-modern types
2311080	2314040	And I was looking at Richard Rorty the work the other day
2314040	2316840	And he seems to buy the post-modern idea that
2317320	2322120	Everything is just a network of linguistic representation and that there is no real beyond that
2322280	2325800	That's that's Dylan's critique of that being similarly logical reductionism
2325880	2329880	All you do is transfer all the markers of reality onto properties of the text
2330280	2335320	And then you you you prevent the text from being subject to the very criticisms you're making of reality
2335480	2341560	Yeah, well that that that seems credible to me. Okay. So so so it was marlapunty accepts the reality of beauty
2342520	2347160	Exactly because think about what this means if the hermeneutics of suspicion is
2347800	2355880	Right that appearances distract us deceive us right there has to be something under that right and beauty is when appearances disclose reality
2356680	2357880	Yeah
2357880	2360920	That's the that's what I mean. That's what I believe that that's the artist
2361000	2367640	I mean that's the artist take or that's the liturgical take or it's the the beauty of an of a church or the beauty of an icon
2367720	2369720	or the it's it's the notion that
2370680	2377960	That that god or ultimate reality or however you want to phrase it is disclosing itself to us and that appears to us
2378520	2380520	as the connection between
2380680	2387160	That which we encounter these these patterned beings that we encounter and what they reveal to us about the other transcendentals
2388280	2391400	Well, when I wrote this chapter, which is my favorite chapter in both books
2391480	2394120	It's try to make one room in your house as beautiful as possible
2394120	2396120	And so this sort of step behind
2396200	2401320	Well order your room first so that it's just not cluttered and and idiotic and and
2401880	2406680	Running at counter purposes to whatever your purposes are a reflection of your internal chaos
2407160	2412600	Get it orderly, but that's not good enough. The next thing is see if you can make a relationship with beauty, which is really
2413080	2419480	It's it's really uh people are afraid of that a because I've watched people try to buy art and they're terrified of buying art
2419560	2421560	and the reason is is because
2421560	2424520	Their choice puts their taste on display
2425000	2427000	and if their taste is
2427080	2432680	undeveloped then their inability to distinguish between a false appearance and
2433000	2439000	The genuine reality of beauty is immediately revealed to people so they're terrified of it, but they're also equally
2439480	2442520	Terrified of beauty. So let me tell you a story about this if you don't mind
2443080	2447080	I I bought some russian impressionist paintings for my father
2447880	2451000	And I liked them a lot. I this particular artist
2452760	2457880	The russian impressionist style is like the french impressionist style except it's a lot rougher the brushstrokes are
2458760	2463320	Thicker and so it's lower resolution, but it's equally beautiful in terms of palette
2463560	2466520	And I have a variety of paintings if you get some distance from them
2466520	2469480	They just snap into representations so lovely
2469720	2474200	And so I sent my dad like eight of these paintings and my mom took one look at them and she said
2474760	2476760	Those are not coming out of the basement
2476920	2483480	And so and my mom is is a conservative person so she's not high in openness. She's not that interested in ideas
2483800	2486680	And she's not and her aesthetic sense isn't
2487240	2489800	Sophisticated now my mother has a lot of lovely attributes
2489880	2495480	But but and my dad and her differ in that and so I he loved these paintings and then he made these
2496200	2499000	frames for them and then he brought one up
2499640	2503400	And my mom tolerated that and then he brought another one up
2503400	2507320	And then she tolerated that and then like all eight of them eventually made it upstairs
2507400	2511560	And then a few years later I was there and she told me how much she loved the paintings
2511960	2515320	But it really they really set her off and I think it was partly because
2516200	2518200	well, if you're
2518200	2522920	Imagine you have you're you're comfortable in your canonical perceptions of objects in some sense
2522920	2527080	And then the impressionist come along and say, you know, you could look at that whole landscape as if it was nothing
2527080	2531000	But the interplay of color and that's we forget how radical that is
2531000	2531480	I mean
2531480	2537560	Those paintings caused riots in Paris when they were first showed impressionist paintings and that's what my mother was reacting to
2537560	2540760	It's like, oh my god, there's a whole different way of looking at the world
2540840	2543560	I don't want to see that and it's an invitation to
2544440	2550120	That which is beyond the triviality of your perceptions, let's say, but it's to think that there's nothing about that that's
2551000	2553000	Worth being frightened of or challenging
2554520	2556920	You don't understand conservatives if you don't see that
2557320	2559880	So but in terms of in terms of beauty
2560360	2567320	One of the things that also that especially now you can one of the the problems or the the way the beauty can kind of overwhelm us
2567400	2572280	Is that we feel as if if we give ourselves we we're afraid of the
2572760	2578280	The suspicion the hermeneutics of suspicion. We're afraid that if we we see reality discloses itself to us
2578360	2582680	And we can see the connection between that which is appearing to me and some
2583480	2587240	Something behind it and I'm afraid that if I jump if I make that leap
2587640	2593400	Then I'll be betrayed or all that or that it will right that it won't turn out to be real or well
2593560	2599880	Sometimes it sometimes it's not like some there are there is it is possible to to be tricked by
2600520	2603160	By appearance and this gets you to to haunt
2603720	2607560	You know saving beauty his critique of what you see going on right now
2608120	2613400	Is he he he argues if you read ancient texts if you read platinus one of the features they'll say
2613800	2616600	About beauty is it striking and disturbing and disrupting?
2617080	2621320	Right. I'll I want to come back to that about the the transformative aspect of truth
2621720	2623880	But but right the transformative theory of truth
2624360	2628520	But and hawn talks about now what we've done right and he talks about in other books too
2628760	2631720	Is we've reduced we try to reduce the beautiful to the smooth
2632520	2636920	Which is the the ease at which we can consume something
2637080	2643000	Like the smooth out of cover of a car exactly right one pixel resolution. Yes. Yes
2643480	2645480	And and and because
2645640	2649560	Because what that does is it gives you and I'll use this word deliberately the veneer
2649960	2653880	Of beauty with but while protecting you from the hermetic suspicion
2654280	2658120	Yeah, right you see that so what we do is and then he says in pornography
2658440	2664520	Is the primary example of that because what you do is you remove all threat all mystery all otherness
2664680	2670040	Of from the person so there's no way they can strike you or disturb you. There's no way to reject you. Yeah, right
2670280	2673560	Yes, exactly. And the and so pornography is an example of
2674280	2678600	Of the smooth completely overtaking the beautiful and being misunderstood
2679160	2680920	as beautiful
2680920	2685320	But if that's if you if you gentlemen are in agreement with that what that means
2685560	2691720	That's my answer to why the primacy of beauty because if you do not get that ability
2692360	2694360	To and I want to use this word
2695080	2700840	Sorry, please go ahead then I'll ask. Yeah, I I want to say through the way I'm saying like through my glasses
2701320	2707800	Beyond and by means of if we can't properly get a moment where we can see through appearance into reality
2708280	2710280	We are locked
2710280	2712280	Into solipsism and skepticism
2712600	2719560	You need a primary and if you do it if you do it rather than it is called to you then you are trapped
2720040	2724680	But you need you need something that calls you from beyond appearances
2725080	2729160	So that you can properly align appearances to reality and you realize
2729560	2734680	That's why the primacy. So is that the ontological calling you out of epistemology?
2735640	2741720	I would argue that that's Plato's argument for what how the beauty how so when you say, okay, so
2742600	2745720	I I've thought thought a lot about the relationship between love and truth
2745720	2749400	And I think love is primary and the truth is the handmaiden of love in some sense
2749480	2753000	But but so there's a primacy there. I would say the primacy of love
2753080	2757080	But you're making an argument for the primacy of beauty. And so are they contradictory?
2757160	2759160	no, no, no, no not at all because
2759880	2760840	Plato's
2760840	2765400	View of love and you have to be careful because Plato is taking the greek notion of eros
2765640	2767240	And he's trying to bend it
2767240	2770920	And I think he's trying to bend it towards what the christians are going to eventually talk about in agape
2771000	2773720	Right. Okay. So take that as a caveat on what I'm saying
2773960	2777800	But nevertheless, what's going on, right is Plato says no, no, no
2778200	2781080	What love is is that you are called
2781640	2782760	to beauty
2782760	2787800	And let me let me let me let me let me just try and show you give me a sec because there's a connection
2787800	2792840	Yeah, okay. So a lot this will sound like where's he took out of left field but like
2793800	2795800	truth rationality
2796040	2797880	Most of the cognitive biases
2797880	2801880	In fact, there's a growing argument that a lot of the cognitive biases confirmation bias, blah, blah, blah
2802120	2804120	A lot of them are actually
2804200	2806200	versions aspects of the myside bias
2807000	2810120	Uh, egocentrism. I won't make that argument here. I think it's a good argument
2810520	2813720	But let's say even if it's only partially true. This is an important point
2814600	2816600	And spinosa got this right
2817240	2820920	This orientation self relevance how things are relevant to me
2821800	2826760	Right that sort of fundamental egocentrism a fundamental way in which you're prioritizing
2827160	2831720	Your perception on the world, right? You can't reason your way out of that
2832200	2835160	spinosa the most logical of the philosopher says no, no
2835640	2841240	The only thing that will invert the arrow of relevance is love. This is murdoch's point
2841480	2844680	Love is when you recognize something other than yourself is real, right?
2845080	2847720	Okay, so so let's okay. Let me ask you about that because
2848280	2851320	I've been thinking about the idea of being selfish. Yes, you know
2851560	2854520	Well psychopaths are selfish, but they also betray themselves
2854760	2859400	Yes, because psychopaths don't learn from experience and they doom their future selves
2859720	2862440	And so I kind of wonder if that love that
2863080	2864920	lifts you out of
2864920	2871400	This self orientation what it does in some sense is that it's the way you see the world if you see
2873080	2878360	Beyond this narrow selfishness because I don't really think there's any difference technically
2878760	2885480	In me in me taking care of the multitude of future selves that I will become and me treating you properly
2885560	2891320	I totally agree. Okay. Okay. I think your relationship to your future self is ultimately an agopic relationship
2891480	2896760	And I think that's the only way you can deal with a lot of empirical research. Okay. So you do you do? Yes
2897320	2901160	Oh, why the empirical research because I think the empirical research shows that
2901960	2904920	Like the I mentioned it in the Cambridge talk that I sent you the way
2905480	2907480	Right what if you do this
2908040	2913640	This is one instance among many experiments you go into a bunch of academics at a university
2913640	2916600	The people who are supposed to be the best at taking data and processing it
2916760	2921160	You present them with all the evidence that they should start saving for their retirement right now, right?
2921400	2923960	And they won't do it. You come back six months later
2924120	2926200	They will they will they you ask them at the time
2926680	2931560	Is this argument a solid solid argument great evidence? Yeah, come back six months. Have they changed not at all?
2931560	2935560	Yeah, the behaviorist behavioral therapists know that perfectly well, right? Yeah, but
2936360	2939480	So if you but if you do the following you say I want you to
2940760	2947160	Imagine your future self as a family member that you love and care about right right. They will start to
2948040	2954280	Save and more importantly the vividness of that imagery predicts how well that's so cool
2954440	2958280	Look, you know this this program that we worked on the future authoring program
2958440	2961400	Well, it's predicated on the idea of developing
2962200	2967320	A love for your future self. So so it's an exercise is in a real sense
2967320	2969480	it's it's like here and it's
2969480	2972840	The ethic that's underneath it although this wasn't particularly
2973560	2975560	conscious in my mind when I built it was
2977080	2979080	Knock and the door will open it's like okay
2979960	2981960	Let's play a game you get to have
2982840	2984840	What you want and need
2984920	2989080	But the rule is first of all you have to accept it and second of all you have to specify it
2989400	2991080	And so but let's just play it as a game
2991640	2995320	If you could if you could envision a future that would justify your suffering
2995400	2998200	That's a really good way of thinking about it justify your suffering
2998680	3002360	What would that entail and then people and then I make it practical
3002440	3004920	It's like well, what do you want for an intimate relationship?
3005080	3010440	How do you want to treat your family members? What sort of job or career like I break it into seven practicalities, you know
3010680	3012680	To nail it down to the ground
3013000	3016440	And I do believe that see one of the things we found we thought well
3016440	3018840	What predicts whether or not this works because it really works
3018920	3022760	We dropped the dropout rate of young men at moho college 50 percent
3023000	3025000	It should it should well it did yes
3025080	3030920	And and it had the biggest effect on those who were doing the worst which is not very common for psychological interventions
3031240	3033240	But one the only thing we could find
3034040	3039080	Content-wise that predicted how well it would work was number of words written
3039560	3044680	And so my sense was well that just was an index a rough index of how much thought they put into it
3044920	3050920	And how vividly and then it would be did they treat their future self with some love like genuinely
3051080	3056760	And then did they differentiate that so it wasn't just an abstract mountaintop conceptualization
3057160	3060520	So but let's add one wrinkle that brings the beauty thing back
3061160	3064600	Because you go back and ask them. Why didn't you pay attention to your future self?
3065320	3070200	Before well sometimes people don't think they could they have no idea that that's even a possibility
3070280	3077800	That's I don't deny that yeah, but overwhelmingly people said I don't want to look at that person because that's me old and ugly
3078200	3081400	They're afraid of it. Yeah, and it's an aesthetic judgment
3082360	3086600	It's an aesthetic judgment and what you have to do is get them to reform it
3087160	3094280	But what if that's an old it's a shallow aesthetic judgment. Yes, that's right exactly my wife. She she she does portraits
3094600	3100760	And one of the things that's really interesting about my wife's art is she will look at she's like goya, although, you know
3100920	3105240	Goya is goya obviously, but one of the things I really found striking about Tammy is
3105560	3109560	Like she did a very detailed picture of my daughter's surgical wound
3110040	3114280	And that's not an easy thing to look at right because you don't want to look at that
3114600	3118040	But that also ties in with the ideas we've been discussing about the fact that
3118760	3120760	so in in the story of exodus
3120840	3121720	when
3121720	3126040	God tells moses how to stop the israelites from being bitten by poisonous snakes
3126040	3129160	He insists that they have to look at what's poisoning them
3129720	3134280	And well, I think that's the with the mystery. Yes, the mystery of the crucifix. You bet right
3134840	3138920	Yeah, all these images that we have like the beauty of christ wounds all these things which sound so
3139560	3141000	completely
3141000	3147640	Pathological yeah to many people if you can understand them properly you can understand that that you have to gaze on that which most threatens you
3147720	3153400	Yeah, there's right there's a verse and then then you say well this inadequacy of vulnerability that characterizes old age
3154360	3161000	That's a terror in that yeah, and so people won't go there right but you what you do is you replace the shallow aesthetic
3161720	3163720	Right, don't let the appearances
3164120	3167880	Right right distract you right let the experiences disclose
3168600	3172440	What if that was an old family member right always look through
3172920	3178360	And see that those appearances are that's somebody who's been there right that you care about someone you love
3178600	3183560	Exactly and so you beautify them so you love them and the love and the beauty they reinforce each other
3183880	3188840	So for me to answer your question right the the you you're saying the primacy of love
3189320	3191320	And I think you ultimately me an agape glove
3191640	3193640	right that and beauty
3194200	3196040	if you're incapable
3196040	3198680	of turning the arrow of relevance and saying
3199240	3203400	I want that to exist rather than I want that to exist for me
3204520	3205560	Right
3205560	3209400	That's what beauty does and that's also the central move. I would argue in love
3209880	3216360	Okay, so do we do we want to detour into the true and the it's beautiful true and beautiful true and the good the good
3217560	3221080	Do you have something equally revealing to say about the good and
3221960	3223000	The true
3223000	3224120	Yeah, I do okay
3224200	3228920	Well, let's let's let's let's go there and then we'll continue through this because I thought that was really useful
3229080	3235480	Well, and and and I would like this if I if I would request that we return back to that whatever this discourse would
3235720	3239000	I I love following the the logos. That's that that that I
3239560	3242040	I aspire to be like socrates like a true christian
3242600	3249400	Well, but it's mostly like a two follower of socrates too right fair enough fair enough right and but I I'm hoping that in this
3249800	3252600	in this deal logos if we if we get into the depths
3253160	3257320	Of the true the good and the beautiful that we can address my criticism of you
3257560	3262440	Yep, which is I'm making a criticism on behalf of the of the enlightenment and cost. Yes, yes
3262440	3267400	Which is the fracturing of the the normativities into three autonomous spheres
3267720	3272120	Yeah, and this argument if it's going to go forward needs something that would
3273000	3278920	Yeah, I see I see I see what you're doing. You bet. Yeah. Is that okay with you? Yeah, that's all right, okay
3279480	3281480	so for me
3282040	3284040	The the the thing I want to say
3284520	3286520	first about about the good
3286920	3288040	is
3288040	3291160	There's two readings to make about about this
3292040	3297000	And one is and this is what the enlightenment did we can reduce and jonathan's already challenged this
3297240	3301560	But we can reduce the ethical we can sort we can reduce the good to the ethical good
3301720	3307080	So that when we're talking about goodness, we're asking how moral a person is in their standard modern meeting, right?
3308040	3309160	now
3309400	3310280	what
3310280	3314440	Plato argues is that is actually a derivative form of goodness
3315320	3318360	It's kind of an algorithmic form. It's kind of an algorithmic form
3318360	3322920	But so so here's the the central sort of at least I would argue now
3322920	3327400	Of course, there's going to be 10,000 plateness will disagree with everything I say because play does been around so long
3327720	3330440	Right, but I think I could make a good case and I think this lines up with
3331080	3338040	The best book I've ever read on play though DC Schindler's a Plato's critique of impure reason the best book hands down my whole life
3339000	3341000	DC Schindler's astonishing
3341240	3343240	But here's a here's a proposal
3343800	3345800	right
3346840	3352280	We and you can you can see date cart wrestling with this in the enlightenment and sort of failing we need
3353560	3355160	intelligibility
3355160	3357160	To be wedded to reality
3357880	3360840	Right, the structures of intelligibility have to be
3361560	3365320	Not identical to because that's impossible. You try idealism in that field
3366120	3368520	I'm sorry. That was too fast for some people, but I'll just let that go
3368920	3373560	But so I we the map has to correspond to the territory whether correspond
3373640	3375640	It has to there has to be a conformity
3375640	3378600	There has to be a contact and a wedding to them together
3378600	3382680	There can't be a space between them like there's between map and territory because soon as there's a space
3382920	3387000	There's what guarantees and what manages the space and at some point
3387400	3392760	This is this is Taylor's point. You need a contact epistemology. No, right, right, right, right?
3392840	3395560	So, you know, there's nothing you can do
3396600	3398040	right
3398040	3404440	That will show me or give me an argument for why intelligibility shall map should conform that way to reality
3404760	3408920	Because what you'll do is right locked in right and this is what Plato saw
3409320	3414520	Right, but what what Plato's basically saying is there is it's like if I can put it this way
3414520	3416520	I'll try and put it in a way that's more narrative
3418120	3420120	It's like there's a perpetual promise
3420520	3425960	That intelligibility will track reality and that we find that to be inexhaustibly the case
3426360	3432040	But there's no argument we can give that will ultimately explain that because every argument presupposes it
3432920	3438040	Does that track as I'm I'm not sure why the last part of that is true
3438120	3439640	Although I agree that it's true
3439640	3444920	So and I and what's running around in the back of my head while you're laying that out is I think well in some sense
3444920	3449800	That's the problem that evolution solves in a technical sense. So, you know, let's say
3450200	3452680	A mosquito lays a million eggs in its lifetime
3453000	3458520	And so that's a million mosquitoes whose epistemology better track ontology, but almost none of them do
3459000	3463960	So they all die. Yes. And so that that that mapping I think
3464680	3467960	Because it's philosophically important impossible in some sense
3468600	3469720	I think that
3469720	3475720	The process of evolution is actually what solves that and then our cognitive architecture emerges out of that evolve base
3475800	3483640	And so it's taken 3.5 billion years to produce the solutions that we have to mapping intelligibility onto
3483800	3485800	I totally agree with you about this. I agree
3486280	3491000	So, let me agree and then tell you why I think it goes deeper. Yeah, okay. So just very quickly
3491560	3495960	The the I think relevance realization basically does that same thing that evolution does
3496360	3501400	It has this it's a self-organizing system in which you would introduce variation and then selection
3501560	3506200	Your your attention is doing it right now. There's a there's a drive to open up mind wander vary
3506440	3511320	And then there's and what you're doing is constantly evolving your fittedness your optimal gripping
3511880	3517800	So towards some end, which is the dialogue of the conversation. Yes. Yeah, and whatever that's embedded in exactly. Yeah, right
3518040	3520040	Yeah, so you're doing this
3520040	3523640	Yeah, and there's a space of associations beside what you're doing
3523800	3527240	But yeah, what I'm saying is evolution actually presupposes
3527640	3529960	an ontology in which that
3530440	3536760	Will work, right? Right. So that's right. Okay, right. Okay. So that you should have something to say
3536840	3540040	But we talked about we've talked about that before like when we when we did that
3540760	3542120	thing on Genesis
3542120	3545720	And you talk about how it's this idea of a psychic projection
3545800	3552200	But the idea that let's say you example could imagine that you could psychically project patterns and and and
3552600	3554760	onto the world means that it presupposes that
3555720	3560440	The same problem that means that those patterns are presupposed in the manner in which the world exists
3560520	3564200	And that even be right in the historians of science. I've read who
3565160	3569720	attempt to embed the development of science in a Judeo-Christian ethic by necessity
3570360	3575880	Also, you know giving obeisance, let's say to the influence of the Enlightenment say that the
3576760	3578760	notion that
3579080	3580440	There was a logos
3580520	3587320	There's an ontological logos as well as an epistemological logos was that precondition for the development of the scientific attitude
3587800	3593400	And I think that's true. Yes. And I think and that's the that's the cornerstone of ancient epistemology
3593560	3598680	You don't ask the question how from this the the workings of my mind till I get to the ontology
3599000	3604120	You ask the question. Well, whatever knowledge there is presupposes intelligibility, right?
3604200	3609400	And then I asked I have to ask what must the world be like such that that intelligibility reliably exists
3609880	3616680	It's a very different orientation. That's for sure. Okay, so but let's take it that this is at least a plausible argument
3617480	3620200	the promise that intelligibility is wedded
3621000	3621960	to
3621960	3622920	reality
3622920	3628360	And there and that we can realize it through something like relevance realization cognitively or
3629000	3633640	Biologically adaptivity through evolution, right? That promise is continually made
3633880	3637640	But we can give no explanation for it because given what we've just said
3638040	3641560	Every attempt to explain it presupposes it as a fundamental thing
3642840	3647960	Okay, that seems just fine to me the fact that the promise is inexhaustibly kept
3648760	3650760	is the good
3652600	3653720	Hmm
3653720	3661240	Is that the good that is referred to in genesis when god uses the the logos to derive habitable order out of chaos
3661480	3666040	Well says it is good. Is that the same idea? I hope so. I mean
3666920	3670840	For me, that's what playdough means when he talks about how the good is even beyond being
3671640	3673640	Because the good makes possible
3674200	3679560	The intelligibility of reality. Okay. Well, that's kind of what I'm trying to also drive out in this system of propositions
3679640	3682040	And that's what I meant and I hope you took it as a compliment what I said
3682040	3684360	I think this is a neoplatonic argument you're making
3685000	3690440	You're you're you're doing a lot of the similar moves. Okay. Now the thing I have is
3691000	3693000	Right, so that's the good
3693880	3696920	And and then is there a way of and
3697640	3700600	Oh, you mean I think jonathan will have some important things to say
3700600	3706920	So that's like the a priori structure of being before there is there's actually beings. It's like there's it's there's an it's an
3706920	3709720	In this there's a there's a potential intelligibility
3710280	3712280	Even for the finite in relation to the infinite
3712760	3717480	Exactly because if and and what you can do is you can reject that fundamental goodness
3717480	3720440	And I and notice I can't give you an argument to get you back into it
3721000	3726760	But but if you reject that fundamental goodness, you will be you will be you and you you see dey karp wrestling with this
3727080	3729080	Because he tries to
3729640	3735240	He gets sort of stuck inside the kajato, right? And he's trying and and he's I think they're for you
3735320	3738040	Right and and and and he realizes. Oh
3738680	3743640	Oh, I could be trapped in solipsism and skepticism. And what does he do? He says, oh, no, no
3744280	3746280	There must be a god that guarantees
3747240	3751000	That the intelligibility the clear and distinct ideas map onto reality
3751160	3757160	He realizes he needs something outside of the argument in order to guarantee that fundamental goodness
3757400	3759160	That makes everything else possible
3759160	3762840	But then what he does is he creates famously a circular argument for that god
3763240	3767480	And so he tries to make an argument for it, but he ends up presupposing the very thing
3767480	3771240	He's trying to prove this is what I mean by our apprehension of it
3771240	3777080	Is is not something that is produced inferentially it is an apprehension of a fundamental this fundamental goodness
3777720	3783560	And I can't I can't give you an argument or an evidence or evidence for now. I think
3784520	3789720	I think ethical goodness is dependent on and reflective of at times exemplary of
3790280	3792920	That ontological of your la la mi goodness
3793000	3799640	And don't you think that that's the reason why in so many traditions the infinite is always referred to negatively like the whole notion of
3799640	3804360	Negative theology or oh, that's interesting say more well the idea that that
3805160	3811160	If you want to express that which is which is the source of being you end up having it almost and it empties itself
3811480	3813480	Yes, it is empties itself of all characteristics
3814200	3818040	While recognizing that it is at the same time this the summation of all characters
3818040	3822280	It's like the good ultimately is that which everything is culminating to and then
3822920	3829160	It's a kind of giving away into something which is always more and you think that's related to that a prior acceptance of
3829240	3832280	the of the existence of the relationship between
3833000	3840280	Intelligence and and being well that it's that that that this thing that guarantees that has the is being pointed at too
3840280	3843720	By these processes. I think so. I've been thinking about I've been thinking
3843720	3846840	I don't know I can take you on this this experiment that I've talked about
3847240	3852040	This idea that that identity is kinetic that identity always kind of empties itself into more
3852520	3858040	So I you always use the example of an object like you have a it's like you have a cup and then you have you have
3858600	3861080	So certain level you have different aspects of the cup
3861480	3865640	So in order for it to reach it's good all these elements in order for them to reach it's good
3865960	3868840	They have to kind of they have to give themselves into something which
3869320	3871880	Cannot be found at the level of their elements
3872360	3877560	So so what you end up having is you have hierarchies of beings that that are moving towards that identity
3877560	3880520	But as they reach their highest point they actually empty themselves
3880840	3885800	Into the higher identity and then you move up and then you end up with something that is beyond being ultimately
3885800	3891560	Okay, so let me try something to you because that might start to sow the good and the true and the beautiful together
3891720	3893720	I've been doing a lot on
3894360	3897800	Marrying Maro Ponti with Plato and John Roots and other people are doing this
3897800	3901000	I will but here like the that thing you just pointed out so
3901560	3905160	Maro Ponti's point is you never you can never completely see any object
3905160	3909880	So let's just talk because the number of right or the number of just even
3910360	3913720	Uh perceptual aspects is which is what the castle was doing
3913720	3916920	Yeah, yeah, right and then of course then there's the imaginal aspects
3916920	3921000	I can also all the functions that are implicit in this all the use like right
3921400	3925560	And then so one of the things I've been arguing is is that if you take a look at Plato the
3925960	3928920	Eidos I originally meant the look of a thing, but he didn't mean the look
3929160	3933320	He meant something like the aspect and here's here's what the like so
3934120	3938040	You have all of these aspects and they're unfolding inexhaustibly
3938520	3943240	There's a through but they don't unfold chaotically. There is a coherent through line that runs through them
3944120	3950120	Right you get a sense of as you said the identity, but here's the thing that through line is not itself an aspect
3950680	3957160	It can't be because if you you're making a fundamental it's an a priori necessity right and it runs through it
3957320	3959000	but notice how
3959000	3961000	right first of all that's starting to get us into
3961320	3967720	Not right a sense of the goodness because that's the promise being kept the through line is the promise being kept
3968120	3972120	It's also a different notion of truth. This is something I want to talk about later if we get a chance
3972440	3976760	Truth is this as ala Thea as disclosure rather than as correspondence
3977000	3982120	But notice first of all how that corresponds to beauty and think about what Tammy's doing with the paintings
3982680	3989240	She's right because she's she's don't step don't stop at this one aspect as the appearance
3989640	3994440	But open it up open up all and see and fulfill the promise
3995000	4000440	The aspects even in something horrible. Yes. Yes, that's dependent on your willingness to gaze
4000600	4006040	Which is the story of exodus and and the bronze serpent. Well, and I would say the crucifixion as well
4006040	4009960	That's really interesting because hawn talks about we've lost the ability to linger
4010680	4012680	With things and that's why we can no longer
4012840	4017800	You know if chimps if chimps are in the jungle and they come across a decent sized snake
4018120	4019800	They'll stand at a distance from it
4019960	4024840	But they will gaze at it for up to 24 hours and they have a particular cry
4025320	4030520	Which which is a snake ra that's the name of the cry which they utter that brings other chimps
4030520	4035720	And so they hate snakes right in innately do you show a rubber snake to a chimp that's never seen one?
4035880	4039960	He'll hit the ceiling but then he'll look and so they're out there gazing on the snake
4040200	4045240	It's part of they're fascinated by it despite the fact that it's also simultaneously threatening. Yes
4045720	4049800	So I think that there's increasing evidence for for something like awe
4050520	4053720	It's awe definitely well, that's manifest in pilo erection in animals
4053720	4059960	Okay, but think about what awe does awe is a kind of love and all the things awe does which is really interesting
4059960	4065320	It's one of the few instances where people reliably report a sense of the shrinkage of the self
4065640	4069800	That is nevertheless as a positive element to it. Yeah, even though they're terrified
4070040	4073560	Yeah, they want to they want to follow it through they want to go into
4074520	4079960	Well, I think that's partly so imagine this so so imagine awe imagine pilo erection now
4080040	4085480	So a cat puffs up and you know, that's the hair standing up in the back of your neck. Oh, it's the same instinct. It is
4085720	4093080	Yeah, and I'm doing work on this with a student of mine right now and and how we've exacted the pilo erection into aesthetic
4093640	4095640	Yeah experience, right. Okay. So imagine this now
4095960	4101640	You're out you look at the night sky and it's it's awe inspired and so there's also a call to imitate there
4101960	4106680	So you see the image of mary for example with her foot on the serpent and her head in the stars
4106840	4111240	Well, she's looking at the stars and she's so that's the cosmic realm. It's the infinite and now
4111800	4113800	She's awe struck by that vision
4114200	4118200	And then she in order to adapt to that vision of the infinite
4118200	4124200	You have to imitate that which instills the awe and that's represented by her foot on the serpent. Oh, that's cool
4124360	4130200	Yes, that's for sure. That's why you know, there's there's literally hundreds of Renaissance images of that
4130600	4132520	mary head in the stars
4132520	4138520	Foot on the serpent and I thought I've been thinking through this awe issue for and it has this interesting association with beauty
4138680	4140280	But you can imagine that
4140280	4144440	When a cat dances sideways and pilo erect. It's trying to look larger
4144600	4149800	It's trying to look as if it can overcome the predator. Well, that's what awe does to us is that when we've
4150600	4156040	Historically evolutionarily what we did when we felt awe in the face of a predator is we
4156520	4163320	We felt compelled to imitate the predator so that we could become ferocious enough to overcome the predator
4163720	4169160	And so that's that call to an expanded being that you would associate for example with development of the shadow
4169640	4174200	It's like when you look at something brutal, you know, that really terrifies you
4174200	4176040	It has to call that
4176040	4179560	Capacity for predatory behavior out of that monstrous capacity
4179560	4183080	Now it should be integrated into the kind of ethic that we're describing
4183080	4185240	But you're not good if you're harmless
4185800	4190920	It's way more than that and that awe in the face of what's catastrophic is a call to be
4191480	4196680	More than the catastrophic thing which certainly makes you monstrous in a sense. Well, that's not really interesting
4197800	4199560	because
4199560	4201320	I mean, it's also
4201320	4203320	It also produces
4203320	4204760	sort of increased
4204760	4205960	Seeking of others
4205960	4209720	Which makes sense because one of the ways we can make ourselves band together band together
4210280	4214440	And then and then that seems to get exacted into right
4215240	4216920	I don't have to be big
4216920	4221880	But I can connect or participate in something right right and then you get reverence
4222600	4226760	As opposed to just raw awe. What's really interesting just to supplement your argument
4227240	4229320	And this is work. I'm doing with song you chin
4230760	4236280	If you like they have a they have a device now that will actually cause people to have chills the chills up and down
4236280	4239560	This line run cold water up and down in the right way
4240200	4243720	What you do and what you can do is you can really enhance people's aesthetic experience
4243720	4247240	But even more basically you get people to listen to like to the same
4247720	4250840	Passage of music and you put one group of people in a slightly cooler room
4251080	4256760	They will have a more powerful aesthetic experience because it facilitates pilo erection. Exactly. That's so cool
4256840	4261640	Yeah, I was so thrilled about this notion of pilo erection being associated with the instinct to imitate
4262120	4263640	You know to put those two things together
4263720	4268440	It's like well, what do you do in the face of the predator? Well, one is run away. The other is
4269080	4272600	Become superordinate to the predator and then you might say well
4272600	4277240	What's the worst possible predator which I think is part of the Judeo-Christian narrative because we're trying to
4277800	4283640	Because the snake in the garden is satan. It's like well. What's the worst predator? It's not the snake bad as snakes are
4284280	4286520	It's like a super snake. It's a meta snake
4286520	4291720	It's the sum total of everything that threatens you and so that calls you to be more than that
4291800	4295000	Whatever that is. I don't know a lot about the biology but biology
4295000	4298200	But do the do animals experience this pilo erection?
4298760	4302520	in with let's say a member of their own species that is bigger or more
4303400	4308760	Dominating sure. Yes, they do sure and we also have some preliminary and it's ethnographic
4308760	4314760	So you have to be careful with it that they do something that looks like awe you'll get a monkey
4315080	4320920	You've got the snake thing but there's also a video like of a macaque monkey and it's goes out onto a precipice
4321720	4326440	Which is a little bit dangerous. Uh-huh to watch the sunrise not doing anything. Uh-huh just sits there
4326440	4331560	Well, you know monkeys will look longer if you show them photos of of their troop
4331960	4334920	They gaze longer at the high status individuals as well
4335240	4339080	And if they are encountering a high status individual who could take them out in some sense
4339080	4344680	But not merely as an expression of power as the primatologists insist then they do show
4345240	4347800	Pilo erection in response to the threat from the superior
4348040	4352520	But they're also fascinated by it and you can imagine that part of that fascination is
4352760	4357800	The locking of their attention onto what they could become right because that's what at least at least that it
4358040	4363080	Interests me more in the sense of beauty, right? Yes, where it's it is this sense of
4363800	4370200	Shrinking in front of something in the sense feeling that you're smaller than that and then this desire to move into it
4370280	4375160	Or contact imitation as a kind of internalization a kind of being wetting yourself to someone
4375240	4379160	Yeah, and to form a worship a primary form of worship, right because you
4379960	4383800	You worship what you you imitate what you worship. They're the same thing
4384440	4390120	So, okay. Well, that was fun. So shall we move to the next one? I think so. I mean, I'm getting a sense of
4390680	4394920	How the true the good and the beautiful could be potentially integrated
4395560	4401800	Because I think that's a necessary requirement for this argument and notice how we are moving outside of we didn't talk about true
4401800	4407560	We can talk about that later. Yeah, we're moving outside of sort of standard ways of talking about
4408200	4415160	At least goodness and beauty here. I think there's similar ways of doing a truth that could actually get us back to something that
4416200	4418840	Yeah, well, it's nice to put the dot biological twist on it too
4419000	4424920	I'd wanted to run one thing before we move on which is that the way that I tend to think about it in terms of
4425640	4426920	um
4426920	4430360	When we talked about the idea of the through line. Yes, I think that's the idos
4430440	4436280	I think that's what the form is in play dough. Well, it isn't it isn't what Aristotle thought it was. It isn't just a specificity
4436600	4438600	Right of necessary and sufficient conditions
4438760	4443720	So would you feel comfortable with the notion that it's the manner in which the multiplicity is gathered?
4444120	4448840	It's the logos, right? And so it actually gathers multiplicity. Don't listen to my words
4448920	4452920	Listen to the logos that gathers them together. All things are one, right? Heraclitus
4453400	4455400	Well, so then what we would presume
4455400	4459640	Visionally is that the thing that unites the true the good and the beautiful is the logos now
4459800	4463400	We shouldn't make the presumption of knowing that we understand what that logos is
4463640	4468680	We've got some hints about what it is, but we can't characterize it entirely. Is that a reasonable
4469240	4472760	Proposition in your estimation. I think so. I think uh
4473720	4474920	in
4474920	4478840	Especially if we're careful to do what you did before which is we have
4479720	4480920	um
4480920	4485000	We have a dipolar way of invoking the logos the logos is both
4485720	4487400	the gathering
4487400	4491240	All right, the throughlining if I can put it that way, but it is also
4492200	4493960	right, right
4493960	4500520	It is also the ontological reality that affords that happening. It's it's the fact that I can't exhaust it
4501160	4505560	Right, no matter how far I push it. So whatever through line I have is at most
4506120	4507160	um
4507160	4510920	A signification or a symbol of the fact that it's inexhaustible
4511480	4514280	Did that make sense what I'm trying to say? What do you know?
4514280	4520360	I'm not trying to understand that that the through line is the the significance that inexhaustible
4520920	4524440	In the manner in which it points up or in the manner in which it
4525000	4527000	inexhaustible like this or inexhaustible
4527320	4533640	The manner in which it's the fact that that intelligibility between between representation and actuality
4534200	4536680	Remains regardless of how okay how far you push it
4537080	4540120	So that would sort of be like the notion that the universe is logical
4540440	4544680	Logo space essentially, but and that there's that we're not going to run out of that
4544680	4548280	But it's not going to be logical in the modern sense right of a complete system
4548440	4553560	Even though go to you can't reduce it to an algorithm exactly exactly so the see this is what I mean by saying
4553640	4556600	I don't think of the form as
4557160	4564440	Like a standard Aristotelian essence at least how it's been taught. Yeah to me which is a set of necessary and sufficient conditions
4564760	4569160	Like the low like there's no be there's no becoming in that is there there's just being
4569880	4571880	well because becoming implies
4572600	4576440	transformation of something that's algorithmic but in a but in a manner that's not
4577320	4581400	That doesn't escape from the logos and I mean, I think that's how reality constitutes itself
4581880	4585480	And that's probably that's part of the solution to the scandal of induction
4585480	4590200	It's like no you can't predict with 100 percent certainty what's going to happen next
4590760	4591880	but
4591880	4599480	What will happen next despite its unpredictability like the next note in a symphony is still predictable exactly. This is what I mean about the good
4600360	4605320	The reason why Hume couldn't deal with the problem of induction is it requires the apprehension of the good
4605560	4609480	Which is the promise that this is not going to be logical identity
4609720	4612840	But nevertheless it is going to be inexhaustibly coherent
4612920	4615640	It's going to remain beautiful and in that in that sense
4615720	4617240	It's always going to be
4617240	4621160	Something right to which so it's not algorithm. It's not reducible to an algorithm
4621160	4625320	But that doesn't mean what you said it that doesn't mean it's not habitable. It doesn't mean it's not good
4625640	4628280	It doesn't mean it's not coherent exactly right
4628840	4636280	And your example the the music which john russen used the musicality of intelligibility as I think the best way to think about
4636280	4640520	Yeah, I think so too. I think that's actually I actually think that's why we like music
4640680	4643400	Yes, because I think that music is actually the most
4644360	4648600	Representational art form because for a variety of reasons first of all, we don't see objects
4648600	4651320	We see patterns and we interpret some patterns as objects
4651320	4656200	So patterns are primary then we're looking for the harmonious interplay of patterns and then it's not
4656840	4661400	It's not strictly a causal relationship because the music is governed by principles
4661640	4667720	But it's not formally predictable. Otherwise it gets boring. Exactly, right? So you see that I think most particularly early
4667720	4670280	I've I've experienced that most particularly with box
4671080	4673560	Brandenburg concertos which have this amazing
4674760	4680280	Continual unfolding that's so logical. It almost appears mathematical and yet it's unpredictable
4680360	4685160	And you don't know where it's going to go and it goes there and you think man that just that's just right
4685640	4690600	So yeah, and so you could say that you could say that about pretty much everything that exists
4690680	4693720	That is that you know, I like the glass because it's just easy
4694120	4698920	So so the the idea is that there is a through line in this glass and but the through line
4699240	4701720	Goes through potentiality, which is indefinite
4701880	4705800	It is I can encounter a million glasses in my life and they will all be different
4705800	4711160	That's like the realm of musical possibility. Exactly. It's all but they all end up being predictable to a certain extent once I
4711800	4714360	Grasp it like when I see the glass I recognize it
4714360	4719720	But I couldn't have predicted that this is the glass that would exist. There's a there's a kind of potentiality which
4720520	4724840	Which is maintained within the identity of the glass, but it's not it's inexhaustible
4725320	4729240	Right. And when you see that when you apprehend that and this is scarry's point
4729720	4731000	This is
4731000	4736520	Being struck by beauty you see the tree and it's somehow it's like every other tree you've seen and yet it's not
4737000	4741560	It reminds you of the idos it reminds you of just what you said
4741800	4746920	And that's love I think that that's love too like in love in the sense that I've often said love is
4747240	4750040	The capacity for unity and multiplicity to exist
4750600	4753400	That's what love is. Right. That is that I
4754280	4758120	I recognize something of you that we have in common
4758680	4763240	But I also recognize you're completely separate from me and that is and both are values
4763240	4766040	Those both have to coexist for love to be real. It has to be
4766760	4772760	separation well to give the devil is due you know, I would say that's the kernel of good that the diversity types are pushing
4773160	4776760	You know, we need to recognize the utility of multiplicity. It's like fair enough
4777400	4782600	The the problem with that a problem with that is well, yeah, but what's where's the unity here?
4782680	4787160	Where's the unity? It's all diversity. It can't be all diversity because then all we do we're in conflict
4787800	4789800	so and we we tend to have a
4789800	4793960	We tend to be the modern world had tends towards radical they tend to want to radical
4794600	4798840	change unity to uniformity and then have this kind of crazy
4799560	4807160	Exploded multiplicity whereas the real this kind of natural relationship between between otherness is
4807880	4809160	exactly this
4809160	4810600	both recognizing
4810600	4815880	What we have in common and at the same time being kind of fascinated and attracted to that which we have
4816360	4822440	Well, you think about the reason this conversation works is because we have grounds for commonality in our understanding
4822920	4829000	But that would be sterile without the multiplicity because we would just run over the same territory
4829000	4833720	And so, you know, we hope we aim towards the same thing enough so that we can communicate
4833800	4835800	but I wouldn't like it at all if
4836520	4841800	You didn't each of you didn't bring something to bear on the discussion that i'm incapable of bringing to bear on it
4842040	4845240	so the the last thing I want to bring up is of course, I mean
4845800	4849320	People are gonna say i'm jesus muggling but there's that's that's the
4849720	4853720	That's the the reason one of the reasons are where we can understand that in christianity
4853960	4859480	The trinity is seen as the infinite is the image of the infinite that we have is
4860040	4865640	Is a contradictory possibility of absolute unity and absolute multiplicity
4866040	4872680	And so we we just throw those two up at the same time and we say the infinite is absolutely multiple and absolutely one
4873080	4876760	And you cannot without contradiction and you cannot totally
4877480	4881160	That you can't reconcile that completely because that is ultimately
4882200	4887720	The it's a problem which practically appears everywhere anyways because everything is always
4888200	4890680	Everything in the world has something in common with everything else
4891160	4897400	You know, you know, if it's just being itself, but it it also necessarily must be different for the difference to
4898600	4903160	Goodman argument every object is infinitely some similar and right and right which is
4903880	4909160	Restatement of the problem of perception itself. Yes, like well, you've seen a glass. Yes, but you haven't seen this glass
4909240	4913240	Well, how much difference is there is well, there's an infinite number of differences as it turns out
4913480	4916920	All right, so this is a this is a this is quite a switch here
4917240	4919240	And I think this is a radical
4919880	4921560	uh proposition
4921560	4928040	That maybe not because once you hear it you think well, yes, and then you think well that's self evidence like yeah, well
4928760	4933240	Not so not so quick here the description of a structure of values or an ethic
4933800	4936440	Subject to the code of sales that we've already added
4937080	4943080	Or set of priorities is a narrative. So the description of a system of
4944360	4947720	Perceptual prioritizations and actions is a narrative
4949000	4952680	What do you think the description that could be it could also be representation in image
4952760	4956040	It wouldn't have to be a verbal not a grant a imagistic or verbal description
4956200	4962520	That is what we regard as a narrative. So this is what I I wanted to again challenge you on
4962760	4966840	And it sort of overlaps with the discussion we've having about the true and the good and the beautiful
4967320	4969320	because I think there are
4970520	4975640	Three three different dimensions by which we organize intelligibility
4977400	4979400	So there's a narrative
4980040	4984520	The example I use is video games and and there's a reason why people are doing the virtual exodus
4984680	4989400	They're preferring video games over with the real world because of the dimensions that are found in video games
4989480	4993800	So one is a narrative and the narrative they belong to clearly. That's one of the things so
4994200	5000360	Total agreement that there's two other features that are deeply meaningful to them not
5000840	5005480	Semantic but meaning in life meaningful right one is a nomological order
5005560	5010600	There's a set of rules that they understand that makes sense of that world
5011560	5014920	So that they can move around in that world with confidence
5015320	5018360	Because if they have a narrative, but it doesn't it isn't undergirded by an
5019000	5023560	Okay, is that a reflection in the video game of the same through line and
5024120	5030200	And mapping of intelligibility onto ontology within the that's what I think the nomological but it's a simpler world
5030440	5033560	Yes, so they can establish that first. So you're saying
5035080	5037160	Okay, so it's a slightly different argument
5037240	5040200	Perhaps because I said well a narrative is a description of an ethic
5040760	5042760	And you say there's more than
5042840	5046920	There's more ways that the world needs to be apprehended than the purely narrative
5047160	5048120	And I think that's fine
5048120	5053400	But does that bear on the argument that the description of an ethic is a narrative?
5053480	5056040	No, because we also describe other ways in which we
5057160	5058200	prioritize
5058200	5064200	Our perceptions in things that aren't narratives that are nomological. That's what we call a scientific theory
5064360	5067640	The theory of evolution right is not it is not a narrative
5067880	5075560	It's a description of the way things unfold or let's they say newton's laws newton's laws are not narrative in any fashion
5075800	5079000	But do you think okay? So let me push back on that fair enough fair enough
5079320	5083000	And then you could say well a set of mathematical axioms and and the
5083960	5086680	Operations that are derived from the axioms is also not a narrative
5087000	5092360	But so and fair enough. So then I would say and this will get us into discussion about science later
5093320	5098600	Is the intelligibility and the attraction of those non narrative descriptions of the world
5099560	5101560	dependent on their being
5101560	5105800	nested inside a narrative, but see and so here's where I'm going to answer you back
5105880	5110840	I'm going to say they mutually they reciprocally require each other just like what we were doing with the truth
5110840	5113480	Okay, okay, so that that then okay fine
5113480	5118120	So so is that the same thing as narrative and the scientific description mutually requiring each other right?
5118120	5121160	But you can't reduce the one to the either to the
5121800	5126440	You can't okay one you can't reduce the nomological to the narrative or the narrative to the nomological
5126680	5131080	That's why that's what I was trying to get at three dimensions almost like a cartesian graph with three dimensions
5131560	5135640	Right, okay, you can't reduce if I remove right because I suppose if you do that too
5135640	5139560	You run into the postmodern trap, which is that there's nothing but the narrative intelligibility
5139640	5143320	There's nothing but the narrative there has to yes, and there also has to be something
5143560	5149080	There has to be a space within which we can compare narratives move between narratives and
5149400	5153960	Learn narratives right and there and there has to be something that allows us to override narrative bias
5154120	5157960	You know the research on narrative bias. It's powerful. It's one of our most powerful bias
5158200	5161400	There has to be something that can kick us out of the narrative bias
5161560	5164760	but I think okay the way that that's the way that I would phrase it is
5165400	5167400	myself is that
5167720	5173080	The reason why we tend to think or like even the way that I presented is that the priority of narrative is because
5173480	5180680	Narrative is the embodied manner in which we engage with a structural value. That is it's the way that we engage in a structural value
5181080	5183080	and so because because we
5183320	5189480	See a disc and usually it has a narrative that embodied pattern is a description of the embodied pattern
5190360	5194280	I think that it I think that it's because I don't know if it's a story if you acted out
5194280	5196200	I don't know if it's a story
5196200	5201960	Until it's a representation of a pattern of action because otherwise it's it's more like a pattern of behavior
5201960	5206520	You know like so for example imagine you watched wolves interacting. Yeah, you could say well
5206520	5209960	It's as if they're following the following narrative rules
5210760	5215480	But they're not because they don't have it's not narrative. It's a pattern in their behavior
5215640	5217640	right, but for the same reason that
5218120	5223400	That it's the through line like for the same reason that you can't see the glass from the elements of the glass
5223880	5229080	It doesn't mean that the glassness like the identity of the glass has a causal relationship to its
5229480	5233400	element it's just not a call it's not that a mechanical causal relationship
5233480	5235080	It's a the causal of identity
5235080	5241640	It's it and so the the narrative or let's say the pattern of behavior is causal from above you could say
5242760	5246360	Because it's that the way in which you recognize that the behavior is a pattern in the first place
5246520	5248520	Okay, I want to push back on all right. No, you have to
5249320	5253400	This is one of the areas where we we kind of don't totally agree. Yeah, but that's good because
5254360	5259960	Well, this is a real mystery this problem because it is the relationship between science and the narrative of meaning
5260200	5265480	It's a relationship between ontology and epistemology or between description and value
5265640	5269240	I mean, so it's no wonder that this is causing, you know, a little bit of trouble
5269400	5271400	I want to throw in one more dimension
5271400	5275800	Which is right, which is you could also level up in the game
5276360	5282520	There's a way in there. There's a dimension that's not a narrative. It's it's an act of self-transcendence, right?
5283240	5286360	I call that I thought about as a meta key that you can scale
5287160	5292840	That has to be that's quidditch. By the way, that's what rolling represented with quidditch because there's a game and a meta game
5293320	5298680	If you win the meta game, you also win the game, right? Okay, but not vice versa, which is very it's so smart
5299560	5303640	So sorry you you do this turn you'll just throw these observations that are like
5304120	5306120	What's even worse than that?
5307160	5310920	I think that the quidditch players are chasing is the round ks of lkma that
5310920	5315960	It contains all the potential of the world, right? And it's also the spirit of mercury. I like it's like
5316040	5321000	I don't know how she did that. It's just beyond belief that she managed that. I don't I really don't
5322280	5327640	It's like if you get if you the way to understand it like in terms of a glass would be like once you grasp the logos
5327640	5330920	This is the st. Maximus way of speaking too once you grasp the logos
5331080	5335880	Then you you are able to you've captured all the rules and everything else
5336200	5341640	And once you understand what a glass is then you don't have to you can recognize every glass in the entire world
5341640	5343160	It's like it's such a massive power
5343160	5347000	You overcome the entire game through getting this one thing which is like
5347480	5351800	Which is often the image as a seed or as a golden ball or as something sparkling
5351800	5359240	Which is which you represent like in the world, but it's ultimately pointing above it or well, that's part perhaps that's a
5360520	5365080	Reflected in the insistence that adam is to name all the animals
5365640	5371160	Right in in in the in the story of adam and eve because that's obviously kept in the narrative for a reason
5371160	5373160	And it has to do with the power that
5373880	5380120	Naming and sub doing in the sense that you've described which is the also simultaneous imposition of a hierarchy of
5380920	5384200	categorization that goes along with naming that gives you a grip on the world
5384680	5388440	And that that grip is associated with the moral necessity and requirement in that story
5388600	5392600	It's for me the nomological dimension is the naming dimension
5393000	5394600	That's what science does
5394600	5397640	Broadly construed and that's different from telling a story
5398360	5404840	Naming things is different from telling a story. So but ultimately this is where this is where I kind of come back again to the
5404840	5405800	We're gonna we'll take you
5406360	5410280	We have to not go too far to this because we've been through this from down this path before but
5411000	5412920	so ultimately because
5412920	5416440	We are not disembodied beings like this is so science
5417400	5419400	This type of nomological order
5419480	5422040	Is taken from a position where I am
5423160	5428120	As I see the nomological order I have to climb the yes the ladder and so and
5428680	5432520	Especially most narratives always have a sense of this is moses on the mountain again
5432600	5437880	Yes, yes, but there's also there's that's why the narrative is always this like almost all narratives are that it's
5438280	5442600	You notice the difference and once you you notice the distance and when you notice the distance
5442920	5445240	Then you have to reestablish a connection with that
5445960	5450360	With which you're distant because you don't need an ethic unless you notice the difference
5451080	5454120	You just I mean you don't need at least you don't need an explicit ethic
5454120	5461480	You don't have to why why not unless you notice the difference because you don't have to tell someone how to go downstairs unless they can't do it
5462440	5466840	You're going you don't you don't have a you don't have an explicit set of rules
5467080	5469560	Okay, so there has to be a there has to be an objection
5469640	5473480	There has to be a problem so st. Paul says something like okay the law is written on the human heart
5473640	5475880	Which means that it doesn't mean all the laws are written
5476600	5478440	Extensively in every detail in the human heart
5478440	5485480	It's like no that is in the human heart in that in that little golden ball in that center in that place where everything comes together you have
5486440	5490200	Contain all the potentiality everything that has the through line is contained in that
5490600	5492600	But now if you notice the difference
5492920	5497000	Then you have to formulate that difference and then that becomes the laws
5497480	5501080	Or just the ways of being so I can say something at first like
5501960	5505560	When you're driving a car like there's specific laws and then a problem comes up
5505640	5506440	It's like oh well
5506440	5509960	Actually, there's a differentiation here, which we have to make or else there's a problem right
5509960	5513880	Which means the ethic that's currently keeps getting more and more detail and more and more
5513880	5517320	So you start with the law you end up with like this in Jewish tradition
5517320	5521800	You end up with this huge compendium of exceptions and like details and everything
5522040	5525480	But ultimately the idea is that all of that is ultimately contained in the
5526120	5531160	Something which gathers it all together into one into this ineffable point that transcends
5531160	5535960	I might have followed this but but but the space in which all the laws are being made and written
5536360	5538360	That's not a narrative space
5538360	5540360	Right
5540440	5545320	Let me go after you on that for a minute. The Ten Commandments is not a story because no, I don't think that's true
5545640	5551000	You think that I think it is a story. That's why christ when christ so he okay, that's a good entry point
5551640	5554920	That's a good entry point. Well because the story which reveals the Ten Commandments, right?
5555080	5559480	Okay, but there's also a story in it aren't this aren't I believe that yeah, there is a little bit
5559640	5561160	But I think they're you're right
5561160	5567320	But why this is why we say that the Ten Commandments is embedded in a story without the story of the israelites leaving
5568360	5574200	Leaving egypt finding themselves in the desert of of of nothingness having to reconnect with the transcendent
5574760	5577720	That is why the law exists. So the nomological
5578440	5579480	order
5579480	5584120	Is embedded in the story you wouldn't have to but the reverse is also the case
5584520	5589080	Go ahead. Go ahead if there isn't if god doesn't offer us the nomological order
5589080	5591800	There's no point for the exodus in the story, right?
5592280	5597080	Right, that's okay. We could we could hypothesize that it comes up from the bottom and down from the top
5597640	5601480	No, no, this is this is even before that right. We're trying to talk about
5601960	5608600	Like I'm proposing that the narrative and the nomological and whatever we want to call this self transcending dimension
5609080	5613560	Are irreducible to each other they're not neither none of them can exist independent
5613560	5619640	That's why I'm using the three dimensions. Yeah metaphor. Yeah, right. They are interdependent, but they're not they're not reducible
5620200	5625160	So I'm resisting I would say the the ontology is is not captured inside
5625960	5627960	epistemology because
5627960	5633080	Epistemology cannot reach to the full extent of the multiplicity of ontology
5633640	5636280	So, okay, so now why is that relevant to what you just said?
5636840	5640680	That's part of the irreducibility you're arguing. I think in some sense that
5641160	5645400	No matter what the story is there's something that's real that's beyond that story
5645720	5649560	Is that okay? Okay. So so let me put a couple of twists in that got it
5650520	5653720	Is that okay for you Jonathan right now? No, I think it's fine. We'll keep going. Okay. Okay
5653720	5659320	So you said there's no story in it in the 10 commandments, right and Jonathan had one objection
5659320	5663800	I have a different take on that that that he may appreciate maybe maybe you too
5664680	5668200	When the Pharisees so the Pharisees and the scribes are always trying to
5668680	5674360	Trap Christ in the gospels into making a heretical statement or doing something that clearly violates the law
5674360	5677080	So they call them on healing on the Sabbath for example
5677400	5680440	And there's like 10 stories like that where smart people
5681000	5686600	Who run on algorithms try to trap them and it never works because he does the thing you described
5686600	5692120	Which is he just refers to a higher order principle or even three levels up and says like no
5692360	5696120	Yes, but one of the things that happens is the Pharisees come and say
5698120	5703800	Well, here's the decalogue which is the most important law and the trick there is no matter what he says
5704200	5710120	He says the others are less important and so now he's a heretic and and they get to take him away and he says
5713160	5715160	Put God above all else
5715960	5718120	And love your neighbor as yourself
5718280	5719400	Mm-hmm
5719400	5723160	It's all of the laws are derived from that spirit
5724120	5729080	And that spirit is that spirit is a story and that story is the logos
5729880	5736120	And so that's the move that I don't I slow it down, Jordan. Okay, I get that's the spirit
5736120	5741400	I totally get that well then the question is what is the spirit? But why is the spirit necessarily a story?
5742520	5744840	Well, I don't know why it's necessarily a story
5744920	5752760	But I know that it's necessarily a story in that context because the spirit that christ is referring to that unites the decalogue
5753320	5760200	Is the logos and the whole biblical corpus the narrative that stem that spans the entire biblical corpus
5760760	5761960	is the
5761960	5765480	account of the elaboration of that spirit across time and it's
5766360	5773160	embodied incarnation and that presents itself as a story and so and I think the reason for that is that it just
5773400	5779240	Okay, so so I mean I get I get I understand your point. I understand the point that you're making now and so
5780200	5783320	I'm actually understanding your point better than I've ever suggested it before
5783640	5789240	Well, you're talking about that that which transcends the current narrative and that has to be there. There's no reality
5789720	5790440	so
5790440	5791720	Okay, let's
5791720	5793720	Let's leave that for for a moment
5794040	5797480	I just want to maybe one more thing because I think it's important. Sorry. No, no, that's fine
5797720	5798920	I think we're at a key moment
5799000	5803320	So we are so one of the things that that that we've been discussing and this has been coming back over and over is that
5804200	5809400	So let's say that we understand that there is a certain type of equivalence and two functions for
5809880	5812840	Anomological order like a hierarchy that's presented
5813080	5818120	You know like just a series of categories which are related in embedded structure, right?
5818200	5820280	And I see science committed to that. Okay
5821000	5823880	And that this also coexist for sure in scripture
5824520	5827000	That's what we're seeing is like it actually it coexist together
5827240	5830520	Yeah, you have the story of the israeli the bible and then you have these series of laws
5830520	5834520	Which is actually not just n it's a lot a lot a lot of laws, right?
5834520	5836520	So you have all these laws and so
5836520	5842200	But one of the things that you've said several times is that you you want to you feel like the solution
5842760	5848760	To the meaning crisis. Yes, does it need narrative or that narrative shouldn't be part of the solution?
5848920	5851960	And so I think that if those two are
5852520	5858360	Both have their function, I'd say why is it that you want to remove one and keep the other? Oh, okay?
5858680	5863800	That's an excellent question. This is something sam harris struggles with too by the way. No, I'm dead serious about that
5863960	5865960	I'm dead serious about that. So
5867640	5872440	Let me answer this really carefully and uh, tell me if we're getting too far afield from the main discussion
5872520	5874680	Okay, so I'm going to depend on both of you
5875160	5881160	My argument is the nomological order that one of the problems in the meaning crisis is the nomological order that we have
5881640	5888680	Is no longer in any way relatable to or wet can be wedded to a narrative because the nomological order we have
5889240	5891240	Right is that there it
5891640	5896520	So what used to bridge between the nomological order and the narrative order is teleology
5896760	5901640	So teleology says the nomological order is ordered, but it's ordered in this way
5902040	5908600	And the teleology has this structure and then narrative says, oh, I can glum onto I can I can
5909000	5913320	Conform to a teleological order because stories are inherently teleological
5913720	5917480	But they're different from just a teleology just telling a teleology isn't a story
5917800	5925000	But stories can attach to teleology. Is that why is why is describing a teleology not a story?
5926760	5928760	Because you could describe it
5929000	5932360	I think that's you could describe the cup but then the problem is as well
5932440	5935960	Can you describe the top cup in the absence of a narrative?
5936120	5940120	And I mean, I think part of the argument I'm trying to make in this. So this is our key
5940600	5943560	Disagreement in some sense is I don't think you can okay
5943640	5948200	And so well, let's be really careful because we might we might also be engaged in in semantic drift
5948920	5950920	So I I'm trying to limit
5951080	5953080	We can trivialize what we mean by narrative
5953560	5958680	And we they need a description of a series of events is a narrative. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. No. No, I don't want to do that
5958680	5963880	I get your point. No, no, we don't want to we don't want to widen the words so much that the argument
5964200	5965320	Though but
5965320	5972120	Wait a minute. No, no, I would I would actually object to that because any descriptions of events that I can conceive as being one
5972920	5977880	Is has to have some kind of narrative structure. Otherwise, we have the other one. We have the same problem of
5978760	5980760	of multiplicity and
5980760	5987880	And combinatorial if I can recognize that events connect together that that means that you would you have to not metaphorically
5987880	5990760	I actually no, I agree with that. But not but let me challenge it
5990840	5996360	Unfortunately, but and I'm not speaking metaphorically here because if I'm speaking metaphorically, we're just golfing another thing
5996600	5998600	That means that music has a narrative
6000360	6005400	Because it has a melody you're saying a melody is a narrative and that strikes me as a very
6006360	6009640	Improper thing to say that. Okay. That's a tough one man. Yeah, because
6010680	6012680	Then you have to start to wrestle with
6013080	6015240	Well, what do you mean by music?
6015960	6020120	Because you could say that the the sequence of the notes in and of itself
6021240	6024920	May not have a narrative although I'm not certain of that but you could say that because
6026120	6028120	But then the question is
6028120	6033960	When you're listening to the music and it has the effect that you regard as music on you
6034840	6039560	How much of that effect including the aesthetic is a consequence of a narrative?
6039560	6043640	So I would say well when you say music, how sure are you that what you're saying is
6044120	6048120	That's nothing but the relationship of the notes to one another. I agree. That's a good point
6048360	6053560	Because there's no embodiment in that right right and there's a sense in which music is neither subjective or objective
6053720	6056920	Right like beauty. Yes. Yes. It has to have something
6057720	6065320	That is at least analogous to to narrative because in order for you to recognize and and it's funny because the modern's tried to go away from
6065320	6067320	Yeah, you understand the modern's really tried to break it
6067480	6070040	But there was in in in any traditional society
6070360	6075640	There are tropes of music which help you understand when something's beginning when something's ending
6075960	6079560	And you can map them on to narrative very directly because that's what happens
6080840	6086120	Slide you because if you give me them you say oh when I'm going to send you a narrative to mirror to melody
6086120	6091720	Then I'll say here's a logical argument and there's a progression and a through line from the premises to the conclusion. Is that a narrative?
6093400	6100120	Well, that's a tough one right because because the the fact that you selected out those those okay
6101320	6103000	Here's something I've been thinking about
6103080	6105640	I'm going to take a slight detour but go right back to the point
6106120	6111720	So I I thought about this more when I was talking to Richard Dawkins because I think Dawkins is a good faith player
6111800	6115640	And I think he believes he's a real scientist and he believes that the truth will set you free
6115720	6120680	Which scientists have to believe to be scientists because they cannot be scientists if they're not pursuing the truth
6120760	6125000	The truth is sacred to absolutely. Absolutely. You want to admit that but it is okay
6125080	6128520	So so I was thinking about the scientific endeavor and I
6128920	6133320	I thought a lot about this when I was reading Jung's work on alchemy because Jung attempted to
6133400	6137480	Situate the development of science in this alchemical fantasy and it's very interesting piece of work
6137480	6145400	So he believes that there was this immense motivated narrative that provided the historical precondition in the realm of unconscious fantasy
6145640	6150680	For the flourishing of science. So it's an amazing argument in any case
6152280	6156040	Thinking about that I thought well, there's a set of facts and that's kind of the argument you're making
6156040	6160440	There's a set of facts independent of the narrative and that's kind of the scientific viewpoint
6160440	6163480	There's a set of facts independent of the narrative and even more importantly
6163720	6168120	We should identify the set of facts that's maximally independent of any narrative
6168520	6174280	Because why should your facts prevail and we want a universal set of facts and fine
6174600	6178040	Look what we've got with that. But then I think wait a second
6178600	6184040	When you're practically engaged in the processes of science the sort of things that kuhn tried to lay out
6184520	6188360	Is it not the case that you're always engaged within a
6189080	6191080	system of practice and perception
6191400	6195880	That's defined by at least an implicit if then statement. And so I would say
6196600	6197480	if
6197480	6199480	This is your aim then
6199720	6204040	That's the set of relevant and true facts conditional implications. Well, yeah
6204120	6209800	Well, so so if you're a medical researcher, it's like well, here's here is what the cancer cell is doing
6210280	6213080	Well, what do you mean doing because it's doing an infinite number of things
6213240	6217560	Oh, well if we want to understand the cancer cell so that we can eradicate cancer
6218120	6222280	Then this is what the cancer cell is doing now. It's also doing something
6222840	6226280	That's independent of that narrative. But the weird thing about that is that
6226680	6232120	It's doing such a plethora of things independent of that narrative that you drown in the complexity
6232120	6235480	Of course, so so then so then we have a problem here, right?
6235560	6239160	Is that you they have the facts of the cancer cell which are multiplicitous
6239560	6243400	Then you have the set of relevant facts, which hopefully are still facts
6243880	6249160	But those aren't derivable without the narrative that we should save lives that saving lives is good that we can
6249400	6253880	Pay careful attention to the horrors of disease and in the attempt to ameliorate suffering
6254440	6258840	All of that framework seems to be a precondition for the abstraction of the relevant facts
6258920	6264280	I agree with everything you said. Okay, what I disagreed with was the identity statement you slipped in which is the
6264600	6270600	The ethic is a narrative. That's exactly what's in dispute here. The dispute isn't that we don't need these normative structures
6270680	6276440	I'm not disputing that at all. What I'm what I'm disputing is that they're all reducible to the narrative
6277080	6279080	Ethic that there's also a
6279800	6282520	Right. Well, that's also why I wanted to get to the last I mean
6283320	6285720	I think that I'm coming closer to you than ever because
6286920	6289080	In the sense that because I need to work it out
6289160	6293080	But because I I see that in like let's say that there is
6293800	6296760	Clearly a distinction in the story like in the story
6296760	6302680	There is a story and then there's the laws and they're related, but they're different. And so I need to think about how they're
6303400	6305560	Why they're right? Well, one of the things well
6306600	6312600	There's an interesting weirdness there that's also associated with the scientific enterprise because one of the things you're trying to do
6312680	6317960	Imagine if you impose a strict narrative that there's a very limited set of facts that make themselves manifest
6318280	6320520	Well, what you want to do scientifically is say well
6320520	6325640	Let's abstract out the set of relevant facts in a manner that's relevant to a multitude of
6326120	6329480	Redemptive narratives simultaneously. Okay, so let me pick up on that
6329640	6333640	So let me try and using what we've just said specify the difference how I would put it
6334040	6336600	I think what science does is it picks up on
6337400	6342280	Nomological relations which are supposed to be as you say causal invariance for the universe
6343000	6347560	Right force equals mass times acceleration. We'll forget Einstein right across narratives
6347640	6352520	Right, right a narrative is not about causal laws. A narrative is about an
6354120	6361000	Irrepeatable causal pathway when I ask why did Napoleon lose at Waterloo? I don't give you a law
6361400	6365960	I give you a narrative. I give you a narratives are this event leads to this event
6366120	6372520	It's a through line like you said, but it's a through line that explains the specific occurrence of specific events
6372600	6376520	It's exactly the opposite of my mind of what science does
6376680	6383320	Science is trying to explain the universality that is not captured in the specifics of a specific causal pathway
6383560	6387160	That's why I can't see okay, so then okay, so imagine this imagine this
6387400	6390120	You have a so there's this notion in the old testament
6390520	6391960	There's a sequence of stories
6391960	6397320	So it's an aggregation of stories and there's an idea that the meta narrative of christ is implicit in that
6397800	6403240	Set of narratives. Yes. And so then I have this idea. Well, and Jung talked about this as well said
6403720	6408600	Imagine you take any random sample of narratives comprehensive random sample of narratives
6409000	6413320	And you attempt to extract out the common story. It's going to be an image of something like christ
6413400	6416200	You could even say that that's what christ is in some sense
6416600	6418600	so and we can argue about that but
6418840	6422520	It's a it's it's like saying that the hero narrative is archetypal
6422520	6428520	It's the same idea if you have 25 narratives and you see what makes them interesting adventure stories
6428600	6429640	It's the hero archetype
6429640	6433640	So the reason why you can recognize it as a through line in the first place is because it has a pattern
6433960	6439160	But that's my point my point is just like the through line of all the aspects is not an aspect
6439480	6446600	The through line of all the stories is not itself a story. Yeah, but see I'm not so sure that's that is definitely what we're arguing about
6446600	6448600	And I'm not I'm not saying I know this
6448920	6450920	There may be a distinction between
6451320	6452680	as story
6452680	6459160	And the pattern of all stories and maybe that's something we can think about too because in my work in maps of meaning I called
6459800	6461880	Just a narrative a story
6461880	6465320	But the the story that unites all narratives is a meta story
6465480	6468440	It's and piaget caught on to this too in some sense because
6469000	6474840	He started to try to find out what kids regarded as true and then by the end of his career
6474840	6480200	He said well what we really want to know if we're studying truth isn't the nature of any contingent truths
6480600	6483560	So any representations within a system narrative otherwise
6483720	6489640	But the process we need to specify the process by which all truths come to be as the ultimate truth
6489880	6496520	And then I would say that the meta narrative that constitutes christ from the symbolic perspective is the story of the
6496920	6498920	process by which
6498920	6504120	What would we say the it's the story it's certainly the story of the process by which narratives transform
6504680	6507240	It's not exactly a story because it's a meta story
6507560	6511960	It's but it's the problem of it's the problem of this kind of apophatic move
6512040	6516680	It's kinematic reality, which is true also of the nomological order as well
6517000	6520600	It is the origin of the nomological order. It's not a nomological order
6520760	6524200	Exactly in the same way that the origin of a narrative is not a narrative
6524200	6528200	It's not a detailed narrative or say the pattern patterns all move into the manner in which they
6528520	6533400	Transcend themselves and ultimately give up to this apophatic like this this negative
6533800	6540280	Space or negative reality and I think the nomological and the narrative and what this self transcending dimension
6540680	6542680	They all converge
6543880	6546920	Okay, so imagine imagine that's not to say they're identical
6547240	6550360	No, of course they're not because that's why they can write right right right
6550520	6555560	And I I think if they were so obviously identical, we wouldn't have a conflict between science and religion
6555640	6558520	Which we apparently have so so it's an important distinction
6558680	6561960	So imagine you have this set of narratives that are particularized and out of that you
6562600	6568280	You extract a general pattern and the pattern is something akin to the process of adaptation itself
6568600	6573480	Which is the manifestation of the divine word let's say and its ability to call order out of chaos
6573640	6576440	It's got this hierarchy of narratives and there's something at the pinnacle
6576840	6583240	And so then imagine that you have a set of corresponding facts and each specific narrative would give you a set of
6583480	6584600	proximal facts
6584600	6589560	But there's an abstraction from the facts that approximates universal scientific truths
6589800	6595080	But I would say that maybe they exist in relationship to the application of that meta narrative
6595320	6599080	Because isn't it the case now? I don't know. I can't figure this out
6599560	6602520	Isn't it the case that we abstract out commonalities?
6603080	6605400	like force equals mass times acceleration
6606040	6610200	Because we want to further our adaptation to the world. Yeah as simultaneously
6610280	6612920	We're exploring the intrinsic logos of
6613880	6617560	Ontology, but we've already agreed to some degree that there's a there's a
6618120	6625720	Similitude between that ontology and the epistemology. And so maybe as we abstract out from scientific truths towards the universal we
6626600	6630120	Not only must we simultaneously move up the abstraction level
6630680	6637720	In a narrative sense. Jung's point would be we better or we'll misuse the normal logical to destroy ourselves
6638120	6643240	Wouldn't that also be the case if we abstracted up the narrative without also going up the normal logical?
6643480	6651400	Well, he he he believes he believed that the the problem with the first millennia of christianity was that we did exactly that
6651720	6653720	Was that we emphasized
6654760	6656760	spiritual redemption to such a degree
6657800	6659400	try to reduce
6659400	6663320	Redemption itself to the spiritual then the world was still crying out because of its
6663880	6667480	Ontological suffering. It's like well if we're all redeemed by the sacrifice of christ
6667560	6670920	it's like what's with all the poor and diseased people and that that
6671480	6677160	Call for the unredeemed material was part of what he saw as the motivational foundation for the
6677720	6684280	The the systematic investigation say that led to the development of medicine. Yeah. Yeah, so so there was an insufficiency
6685240	6687240	There was an insufficiency
6687560	6691320	Maybe it's the insufficiency of getting lost in epistemology if it's just a narrative
6691400	6694200	It's just a narrative. Well, it's not it has to refer to the world
6695320	6697640	Okay, so well
6697640	6702360	That complicates things right because we're part of what we're stuck on here to some degree is
6702920	6707640	In that ontological realm that's outside any given narrative. There is also a logos
6708280	6712360	And then the question is is that ontological logos the nature of the world itself
6712840	6716680	Somehow a narrative and the christian idea to answer that would be
6717640	6719880	Well, that I don't know because creation is separate
6720520	6722040	creation
6722040	6728680	Yeah, speaking on behalf of christian. Yeah, I think christianity makes the claim that the logos is ultimately a person not a narrative
6728680	6732440	It's not a story. Yeah. Yeah, that's very important. Right. The logo is not an it's not a story
6732840	6734680	Everything culminates into
6734680	6741720	Into into the into the person and person literally means originally means hypostasis that which stands under
6742200	6744760	Yes. Yes. Well, it has to be a person right right
6745240	6749480	Well, that's why I also said though that it's the description of a structure values is a narrative
6750040	6756200	So as an embodied ideal christ isn't a story. No, right, but the description of his embodiment
6756200	6759960	That's a story and the images are a story and the the reason we want the story
6760440	6761880	Is because the story
6761880	6765800	Causes us to that to the ethic. That's why we value the stories is right
6765800	6770440	I would like to see the world the way you see it because you have a whole set of tools that I don't have
6770680	6773400	And so if you can tell me a story and I can enter into your world
6773720	6778040	Then that is truly redemptive because the facts now array themselves in a slightly different way
6778040	6782600	That might be very valuable to me if I run into one of these objects that you described, you know
6783000	6788040	I'm running an algorithm and something objects. I don't know what to do. What would you do? Tell me
6788680	6790680	What you did in the similar situation
6791400	6793400	And so I don't think the story
6793960	6797080	The story isn't the yeah god that gets so tricky
6798040	6803800	The the the christian emphasis certainly is is that the embodied reality is the fundamental reality
6803960	6808280	Yeah, but the story isn't nothing. That's for sure. I'm not saying I know you're not. I know you're not
6808280	6811720	I'm saying that at all. I was trying to answer jonathan's question, right?
6812280	6814280	And we're running into the difficulty that I see
6815400	6817400	Whether or not I'm right or wrong
6817480	6821320	There's a difficulty. Oh, definitely that's the difficulty. I'm putting my finger on
6821320	6825880	I'm trying to put my finger on in the meeting. Well, it's also the difficulty that I'm trying to address with this set of propositions
6825960	6830520	It's definitely a difficulty. Okay, but we got somewhere we got somewhere in that I would say
6831080	6836200	I think it was very valuable. Okay, so I'm going to skip to number five here every set of values is hierarchical
6836440	6838040	Otherwise, there's no prioritization
6838040	6842680	I think we agree on that because we've already agreed that there has to be a prioritization
6842760	6846120	And there has to be that implies a hierarchy. So the one thing I wanted to ask there
6846200	6850360	Sorry, I seem to be the the diffusivity. No, no, but it is again
6850920	6854360	Let's go back to embodied living and then this is actually something you see in narratives
6854440	6857800	And I would also say that it's something that some of the parables of jesus
6858280	6863880	Point to because parables. I think mcfag is right parables are narratives that destroy themselves as narrative structures
6864280	6867560	They're kind of like the way koans destroy themselves as questions
6867960	6869240	um
6869240	6871240	And so what I want to say is
6872280	6877400	Let's say that there is we we seem to have like there's the true the good and the beautiful or we have the narrative the
6877480	6883480	Nomological and I'll call it the normative in terms of betterment or something like let's say is it the case?
6885080	6887080	The thing is the hierarchy stable
6887400	6893160	What I mean by that is you get narratives you get stories get works of art great works of art
6893720	6898120	In which it looks like they're picking up on something that is true to our embodied experiences
6898360	6903560	Sometimes we sacrifice the true for the good or the good for the beautiful or the beautiful for the true
6903880	6908280	Like we seem to be making trade up. We don't seem to have a stable what's on top
6908680	6913000	We we shift the prioritizations around. There's a lot of great art at least
6913400	6915720	Proposing that so I think it's a reasonable thing
6916280	6921560	Right. Well, I think that's partly a consequence of the confusion about what constitutes the unification
6921720	6924280	so part of the project I have here is that
6924920	6929720	I'm I'm beginning to view all the narratives that are laid out in the biblical corpus as
6930600	6934840	They're snapshots of the different idea of what should be at the top. They're like the through line
6935800	6939960	Well, they're representations of the through line. We still don't know what the through line is so to speak, right?
6940040	6944600	But there's snapshots so I for example in in the opening lines of genesis
6945160	6949640	God so we'll say by definition. God is what is at the top. We'll just start with that
6950120	6954680	And I'm not going to make an ontological claim about that just an epistemological claim
6954840	6959720	God is what's at the top of your value structure. Okay, so what what should that be?
6960200	6964040	Well, let's say that's a mystery. Okay, so the bible is an attempt to
6964760	6970920	To represent that mystery from a variety of different narrative perspectives and so I'll give you a couple of examples
6970920	6972920	So in the earliest
6973960	6975960	Chapter the beginning of genesis
6976200	6983640	God is the word that derives habitable the habitable order that is good out of chaos and potential
6983880	6989160	Okay, so that whatever god is that's part of it. Okay, so that's that's
6990120	6994360	And god is a creative force and then then there's the next thing is is
6995160	6996200	that
6996200	6999880	God is whatever it is that human beings are made in the image of
7000840	7008120	That also provides them with a worth that transcends the merely material in some sense because god is outside creation
7008360	7015000	And if man is made in the image of god, then there's something about man. That's valuable. That's outside of the mirror
7015720	7018600	materiality. Okay, so that's the next proposition and then
7019800	7025400	God is rapidly that which forbids and allows so that happens in the garden and then god is
7025880	7028760	That spirit that you walk with when you're
7029400	7031400	Unselfconscious and not ashamed
7032280	7038200	So that's that's the story of adam in the garden and then in noah god is that which
7038840	7041880	Calls you to batten down the hatches and prepare
7042440	7048520	When if you're wise in your generations you see that chaos is coming and then in the abrahamic story
7048840	7054280	God is that which calls you out of the comfort of your family into adventure and so it's like
7056440	7062200	Who knows what the union of all those things are right because they're they're quite multiplicitous very but but
7062760	7066760	But I think they're very sophisticated and you might say well is that god it's like well
7067400	7069400	Do you follow the call of adventure?
7069400	7073720	Do you take your own intuition seriously when you think that the flood is coming?
7075080	7079080	The answer to that generally is well you either follow that or you're in trouble people
7079240	7083960	You sure know that and is god the divine word that generates habitable order
7084520	7088920	The habitable order that is good out of chaos. Well, do you believe that truth has that power?
7089560	7091560	so I think
7092360	7098040	Okay, so these are all ways of pointing to that which might unify the disunity that you see now
7098440	7102920	You can't boil it down in some way the same way that you boil down beauty
7102920	7110520	You know, it's it's harder to specify and I think what the bible is attempting to do and and I think this is true of religious writings
7111400	7113400	of many sorts is to
7115240	7118520	What is it it's a characterization of this it's first of all
7118520	7123880	It's an insistence that the thing at the top is a spirit, right? It's not an idea. It's not even like beauty
7123880	7129000	It's not an abstraction. It's a spirit that can inhabit which is kind of an incarnation idea
7129240	7133400	So it's it's a spirit that you can embody or that can season possess you
7133720	7135720	So it's really something that's living
7136360	7141160	And and so it's not merely an abstract idea and it's not just a normal logical construct
7141480	7144600	It's something you enact and it's something in principle
7144920	7149560	You might think well if you're and this leads to the next point any hierarchy that is not unified
7150520	7157480	Produces confusion anxiety anomy aimlessness and conflict psychological and social. Well, why well?
7157480	7159480	It's not unified. You don't know your priorities
7160040	7163400	And if it and if it isn't pointing to something valuable
7163800	7167160	There's no hope because hope is to be found in
7167880	7169880	The movement towards something of value
7170440	7173480	So, okay. Well, sorry. That's a lot. No, no, no, but that's helpful
7174040	7177720	So let me let me say something and it's not really a pushback
7177800	7182920	But it's it's sliding over here and if we can make the connection then maybe we can come to an agreement around it
7183400	7184280	so
7184280	7185720	right
7185720	7186600	Adaptivity
7186600	7189480	Adaptivity is a thing and it's really important and it's not an abstraction
7190040	7190920	Define it
7190920	7195720	Adaptivity is the that you are fitted to your environment in a way that allows you
7196360	7202120	To successfully live long enough to reproduce. Yeah, okay. Okay. So that's kind of an interrated game idea too
7202200	7208760	You have to live long enough to propagate totally. Yeah, totally. And I'm not here to defend, you know
7209720	7214600	A gene version or a group selection. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's not that's not what I want. Yeah, okay. So
7215320	7218920	Adaptivity and you want to you want to you know, how does this?
7219080	7223560	How does this arise and one of the things you can do is you can say here's all these snapshots of
7223880	7226920	Adaptivity and what I can do is I can try and find
7227560	7231160	The what what do they all share in common the capacity to elicit or?
7231960	7238200	Well, wait a sec. Wait a sec. Wait a sec. So like the problem is right this and this is what you see the
7238280	7240840	The naturalists before Darwin doing they're trying to find
7241320	7246600	The shared perfection. Yeah, and then Darwin breaks the mold. He says no, no, no, no, you're making the mistake
7247400	7248920	There is no
7248920	7254600	Right, right. There isn't what there is right is some things are adaptive because they're small
7254680	7258600	Some are adaptive because they're large some are fast some are slow some are hard some are soft
7258680	7260680	Some are unicellular some are multicellular
7261240	7266200	Adaptivity doesn't have but what he finds is but there's a universal process
7266600	7271960	That is right that can explain how all of these different snapshots emerge
7272200	7278440	But there is there is a perfection and the perfection is being itself. It's the continuation of existence
7278440	7282040	Okay, but what you just did you've you've played you're not playing with my analogy
7283000	7287480	You said I can I can meta that and I'm not denying that you can do that John. Okay. I'm trying to use a meta
7290600	7295160	I don't deny that. Okay. I'm not making that claim. I'm just trying to use this as an analogy and I'm trying to say
7295240	7298520	Well, it's a powerful objection because certainly the biologists do that
7298600	7300760	They say well, there's no teleology in evolution
7301160	7305160	And and and I know that you object to that because you say well, there has to be because you can't even
7305640	7309800	There's no unity there in any of the organisms and there's certainly no way of perceiving them
7310040	7315960	But they also have a point which is there's a nomological unity. Even though there's no narrative. That's how they argue
7316280	7321240	There is a universal process that can be understood scientifically that explains
7321640	7327240	Adaptivity explain because if you get the theory of evolution, you say right all the organisms should be right
7327320	7329560	but then you have the problem that
7330440	7336360	Every organism that survives plays out a pattern which is variation on the horizon of potentiality
7336600	7341960	And so then you might say well, there is a there is a directionality because if the organism can't
7342440	7347000	Very creatively on the horizon of potentiality it can't exist or multiply
7347320	7350920	and so then so so there's a teleology that emerges
7352280	7359000	Out of the the necessity for survival and reproduction and so and I would say so think about sorry
7359880	7361880	I gotta get this out
7362520	7366360	I'll say the abstractions you generate in your prefrontal cortex are
7367000	7370440	avatars of the process of adaptation to the horizon of the future
7370760	7372280	and so and so the
7372280	7378680	Flowering of the human spirit in its highest sense is an embodiment of the process by which the biologists attribute
7379240	7384680	The the adaptivity it's the process that utilize adaptivity. And so maybe those things dovetail
7384760	7387240	Well, that's what I'm going to say. So there is a narrative though. No, no
7387240	7388760	No, that's what there's what I want to challenge you
7388760	7393240	You gave me a model of the logos that I would say is not narrative except for a trivial definition of narrative
7393400	7395400	Which is variation and selection
7396040	7396920	look
7396920	7400600	Instead look let's put it back in the psychological. It's like with humans
7400600	7402600	It's the willingness to do that though
7402680	7405720	So it's not just the fact that it can can happen and does happen
7405880	7413080	And that's partly what brings in the narrative element is you do not have to abide by that like you you that can happen to you
7413480	7418360	You can you can have this creative variation and this selection in relationship to
7418760	7420920	Adaptivity let's say to keep it biological
7421160	7423720	But you can you do not have to do that
7424360	7427880	And so I think it's the struggle with that that constitutes the narrative
7427960	7429480	I want to push back on you on that
7429480	7431800	Okay, I think there's all kinds of stuff
7432360	7436600	At the relevance realization doing that variation and selection that you cannot
7437160	7441160	Exercise authority over because your authority actually depends on on the right
7441400	7445320	So it's different than the level at which you have narrative access to your own being
7448840	7452360	And look I think that that's related to Jonathan's objection earlier
7453000	7457720	That the law is inscribed on the human heart. It's like yes, I agree, but but
7458360	7460520	Let me say if I claim that
7461240	7463240	human evolution
7463240	7469160	builds a material embodiment that strives towards manifestation of the logos and then there's an abstraction
7469720	7471720	And and that meets in the middle
7474200	7477560	The fact that you can't control all the manifestations of your
7478280	7485720	Prioritization structure doesn't mean the logos isn't built into the a priori systems that structure that perception for you
7485800	7490520	I'm not denying that what I'm denying is that that logos is ultimately operating as a narrative
7491160	7495080	I think the low and look at look at look at even look at even psychologically
7495480	7500680	Narrative doesn't emerge until a certain age and it is pre it depends on dia logos
7500760	7503720	It depends on dialogue. It depends on joint attention
7504040	7506760	It depends on the ability to take turns in conversation
7507000	7511160	You have to have all this dialogical machinery in place before narrative is possible, right?
7511240	7514680	Well the way I would object to that fine. That's a perfectly reasonable objection
7514680	7517800	but the problem with that is is that a lot of that scaffolded by
7519080	7520840	quasi narrative precursors
7520840	7526040	So for example, one of the things you do with a baby before it can engage in in the dialogue is
7526680	7530840	verb mediated semantically is you do a dance like play
7531320	7537480	And the spirit of the logos is and I would say a narrative spirit is deeply embodied in that because if that isn't taking
7537960	7540680	Place within the spirit of love and play and truth
7541080	7544840	Then it isn't going to give rise to the capacity later for the dialogos
7545160	7548440	So that's kind of the embeddement in some sense of the embeddement
7549000	7550680	embeddement
7550680	7556520	Embedding there's the word of the logos in the material right prior to its manifestation
7556680	7561720	And I do think in some sense that's not a story, you know, because if you watch a wolf pack
7563080	7566920	What they're doing isn't a story, but if you describe it it becomes a story
7567240	7570760	Yes, right. So there is an embodied pattern. That's not a story
7571400	7573400	But I think we're agreeing now that
7573720	7575720	Okay, okay. Okay. Well, there
7576600	7581080	There's a lot of so I guess we go back to where you said the description of a structure of that's right
7581160	7583160	I said the description is a story
7583240	7587160	Now that doesn't mean that the description doesn't match the underlying behavioral pattern
7587640	7589640	You know, I think one of the things I
7590200	7592760	sort of thought through and maps of meaning with the moses story is
7593720	7595720	Well, why why those laws?
7596200	7600680	So you see in the story, it's so bloody cool before moses goes up to the mountain
7601800	7603400	He spends
7603400	7605400	Decades we don't know forever
7606280	7608280	morning tonight
7608280	7611240	Judging objections. So the Israelites are out in the desert
7611320	7616120	There's no structure and they fight with each other all the time and then they come to moses and say well, we're fighting
7616200	7617320	What do we do about it?
7617320	7623720	And he like judges them and his father-in-law actually says to him you have to stop doing this because it is absolutely
7624280	7628360	Exhausting you and it isn't till after that that so then you think what's he doing?
7628600	7630680	We're seeing all these micro narratives, right?
7631080	7636120	And then he has to discriminate between them, which means he's turning them into a hierarchy of value because that's what the discrimination is
7636760	7640120	This is what's right in this conflict. So conflict
7640920	7644920	Hierarchy and then he's doing that just constantly so you can imagine that within him
7645720	7646520	this
7646520	7653400	Hierarchy of value is starting to be built explicitly then he goes up on the mountain and it's like bang. Oh
7654520	7655800	This is
7655800	7662200	What all our striving is oriented to and then he comes down the first time it doesn't map as you said the second time it maps
7662520	7667480	So the the deliverance of the message from on high has to map on to this and some of this
7668440	7674600	Conflict and its agreement would emerge from biological acceptability because the people would say oh
7675640	7679720	I feel as though that was just it solves the problem
7680120	7686040	And so the the materials in communication then with the abstraction. I think I think we're close to agreement. I guess
7686920	7688520	To circle back
7688520	7694920	I don't I don't sort of deny that I don't I'm really not denying that narrative is a powerful way for disclosing
7695480	7696840	intelligibility
7696840	7698200	And the logos
7698200	7704360	Right, what I'm saying is is it there's a privileging of it here that I'm okay. So is it okay?
7704360	7706360	So is it important? Is it important?
7706920	7709480	Is the distinction that I just made between
7710360	7712360	an embodied pattern
7712840	7714840	and a narrative enough to
7715400	7720440	Dispense with your with your objection or is there more to it? Well, let me let me let me see
7721400	7727000	Because I think that theories and poems and music things that I'm treating as non narrative
7727240	7730920	Can disclose depths of reality that I can't disclose with the story
7731800	7736520	Okay, so why is it? Why is it important to you or necessary to make that distinction?
7736920	7741560	Do you think? Well, why is out of curiosity? Well, it's important for me is that
7742360	7744360	I'm concerned about
7744440	7746440	a privileging of narrative
7746840	7751560	All used to be an inappropriate privileging of narrative border on idolatry, right?
7752040	7755320	In that we are well, that's kind of what the postmodernists do
7755560	7761160	So there's definitely a danger there, right? If you overprivilege narrative to the point where the ontology itself disappears
7761160	7765160	I think what's the honest thing is that he's afraid that if we embody if we embrace a narrative
7765240	7768200	Then the solution to the meaning crisis won't be universal enough
7768840	7771960	Is that something that's so that's a practical implication because
7772680	7774520	I I would propose to you
7774520	7775560	It's a proposal
7775560	7776360	Okay
7776360	7782920	That whatever is going to resolve the meaning crisis has to reintegrate science and spirituality
7783080	7789400	If it does not do that, right? Well, so that's partly also what you're insisting on is that there is this domain of scientific knowledge
7789480	7797240	That should be regarded as in some sense independent of narrative and that's I'm still having a very much trouble with that because we still have the problem of
7798040	7799640	If then, right? It's like
7799640	7802680	But and I don't see how we escape escape from that
7803080	7807240	But that's where I push on back on the trivialization if if then constitutes a narrative
7807640	7809640	No, no, it doesn't okay if
7809800	7816360	Constitutes a narrative if yeah if does because if has to be well if we want to cure disease if we want to
7816840	7821400	So Jung believed that the spirit of science grew out of the alchemical fantasy
7821640	7825480	And so the alchemical fantasy was we will find in material
7826680	7828680	this solution to
7828760	7830760	ill health death and
7830920	7832200	privation
7832200	7837240	Well, yeah ill health death and privation. That's exactly it. And so Jung's point was without that
7838040	7841560	Impulse which he regarded as a compensation to the hyper
7842280	7849480	Spiritualization that Christianity imposed in the world in the first Christian ion without that fantasy deeply like deeply embodied
7850200	7853160	Manifesting itself out of embodied behavior and then out of image
7853400	7855400	We wouldn't have been because Jung said well
7855800	7859400	How do you get someone to look down a microscope at an amoeba for 10 hours?
7860440	7863560	Because like no animal will do that and his notion was well
7863560	7869000	We had to be gripped by something of a dream of intense motivational significance
7869160	7875240	And it was the dream that redemption could be found in analysis of the transformations of the material world
7875640	7877640	right, but like but
7878280	7881640	The the the motivating the motivating structure
7882280	7887080	Is not the same thing as the reference of of what i'm talking about right right right right
7887080	7889480	So i might be narrative to do science
7889720	7894120	But we don't want to make the genetic fallacy that that means that everything that science is referring to
7894600	7899000	Is a narrative, right? Yeah, right the fact right right that that'd be like
7899720	7902600	That's like saying everything i talk about i have to speak in english
7902600	7907960	So reality is made of english that does bring us to the postmodern conundrum because they would insist that know all the
7907960	7913160	Sets of all the facts that science derives are in some simple sense a narrative right?
7913160	7916680	And then that narrative is associated with the drive to power and domination
7916920	7923240	And so yeah, we do have to be careful that because we'll fall right into that trap right so that that that's what so if you
7923240	7926440	Want to comment no, but i can i say this?
7927960	7932280	I I I I do think that a great manner in which modern
7932920	7934920	science got developed who does
7935400	7938200	Is I think it is narrative that is there is
7939000	7943720	On the one hand the desire to deliver and but on the other hand the desire to dominate is there right
7943960	7947400	We've talked about this before with bacon. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and I don't deny that
7947400	7947960	Yeah
7947960	7954520	And so there is it there is and so it doesn't take away the but the same motivation can drive people in doing mathematics
7954680	7957800	Yeah, right at the same motivation can drive people doing music
7958040	7964680	So we don't want to say that's the essence of science or music or mathematics because then we're doing we're removing the important differences
7964760	7969480	You're afraid that we're collapsing everything. Yes, but I think yeah, I think that it's mostly about high
7969560	7971560	it's about hierarchy in in the sense of
7972840	7975640	In the sense that because we are embodied beings that are living
7976040	7980680	That are living in the world that are living lives and all that we do all that we care about
7981160	7983000	Is part of that reality?
7983000	7986840	And so even the nomological order, although I think I I agree with you now
7987080	7992600	It's definitely not a narrative, but it is embedded. That's why Jordan used it
7993400	7995400	The expression embedded in narrative
7995400	8000440	Yes, that is that it has to but isn't the reverse the case narrative depends on
8000760	8003960	The presupposition that there is an ordered world in which it can take place
8003960	8008760	Right, but that the question is then is that logos that constitutes the order so to speak
8009240	8013960	If when you represent that do you necessarily represent it as a narrative? And this is a deep question
8014040	8016920	I mean, I'm proposing to you that the logos is that which
8017160	8018280	Which
8018280	8024280	Allows the narrative order and the nomological order to unite to what they're doing. That's what I'm saying, right?
8024440	8027800	Okay, but that's fine. I but then I might wonder does it extend
8028120	8033160	Does it extend to the narrative order and to the underlying on ontological order as well?
8033320	8036440	The logos is both in the story and in the logic
8036680	8044520	That's we think about just even follow the history of the word logos and watch how it goes in these two different directions
8044840	8046520	With good reason
8046520	8048520	Yeah, yeah, well, so okay, so
8048920	8055720	Then then the question so you're objecting that the logos isn't a story and and that's so strange and so weird because
8056920	8060280	We could say that what the west is kind of split on that because in some sense
8061000	8067080	If you if you think of the development of the idea of the logos from the greek and enlightenment side the answer would be
8068280	8070120	There there's no
8070120	8074040	Immediate insistence there that it's a narrative. That's right on the Judeo-christian side
8074280	8080200	There's a pronounced insistence that it's a narrative. Yes, and our modern culture is actually a union of those two, right?
8080280	8084760	Just described a couple episodes of the awakening for the meaning crisis. That's exactly the argument
8084760	8086200	I try to trace out
8086200	8088520	And well, and certainly the argument we're having right now because
8088840	8093560	Jonathan and I in some sense are making a case where the logo says narrative and embody narrative
8093560	8099640	Although you also point to the importance of embodiment. I'm not rejecting. I know. I know. I know while it's very difficult to differentiate
8099720	8107320	That's right. Yes, and I do like the idea that there's a hierarchy of narrative with the ideal at the top and then a hierarchy of
8107960	8113880	Nomological description and that there's a correspondence between the hierarchies because it does seem to me that
8114280	8117400	And I want to puzzle that out one of the things Jung warned about
8118120	8120680	he thought there was an ethos in
8122040	8125320	The religious story and to some degree in the alchemical story and then when the
8125800	8129000	Scientific revolution hit we blew up the normal logical
8129720	8132200	Into this massively powerful thing
8132440	8137800	But our ethic was left in the same primitive form. So now we're in danger because of that
8137960	8143320	I think I think that's exactly right. I think one of one of I talk about this in terms of propositional
8144040	8149240	tyranny and algorithmic tyranny right and what we've done is we've reduced
8149880	8159080	The logos inappropriately to logic. I strongly resist that move too, right? So you're okay. Okay. Okay. Well, I get I get your caution because I do believe that
8161240	8165880	Devolving everything down to the narrative per se does put us in the postmodern trap
8166200	8168040	Which is what's all
8168040	8170840	In some sense. Well, it's all narrative which is kind of what they claimed
8171160	8177080	And that's a problem because then you can dispense with the with the corrective reality. Exactly. Exactly
8177320	8181240	So I I I use a stereoscopic metaphor. I think of the logos as
8181880	8187080	Like as epitomized in logic as in story and then I try to look through both to a depth
8187640	8191000	That's what I try to think of as the logo school. Sorry. Tell me that again
8191240	8196840	So, you know how I have the left and right visual field and then I look through them to depth perception. Yeah
8198040	8199400	Here's logos as logic
8199400	8203320	There's logos as story and I try to look through them to the depth behind
8203320	8205960	Yeah, yeah, that's well that seems on the face of it quite fine
8206040	8208040	I mean, I'm still in a conundrum because
8209640	8215400	We already agreed that the selection of the facts and even the manifestation of the facts as perceptual objects is dependent
8215400	8217400	On the imposition of a hierarchy value
8217400	8221800	And so that tangles the damn narrative into it again, but so but
8223080	8227160	But there's something that's key to the idea of parallel hierarchies that I think is is
8228040	8232040	A conceptual way out of this and that's one of the key moves in neoplatonism
8232440	8235080	Exactly what you're puzzling over. How do these things?
8235800	8241480	What explains their parallel and what explains beyond the parable parallel what I was trying to do with the
8241880	8245800	Derascopic what what explains their convergence? Okay, okay, what if
8246680	8248680	What if it is something like
8249000	8252600	Let's say I'm using the word person, but let's use the word consciousness
8253160	8260200	Okay, right or so that that that so it's a maximus has this is why I like to maximum so much right because say maximus
8260840	8266680	He has he has exactly what you're talking about in terms of this non-melodic order. This is hierarchy of order
8267640	8273720	And he has a sense in which the laboratory for that is man, right man with a capital M
8274360	8278760	And so doesn't it doesn't it kind of one of the solutions to this?
8279240	8284520	When it be the this relevant realization that you're talking about but the relevant realization happens
8285240	8292120	Ultimately happens in in consciousness or something like consciousness or I mean, I I think it happens in intelligence
8292440	8297400	Because we have a lot of relevance realization going on below consciousness. Okay, and I've talked about this right, okay
8297400	8303080	I think consciousness is a kind of intelligence for specific kinds of problems. It'll define normal novel. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
8303080	8307080	Yeah, that's the horizon unpredictable horizon of the future, right, right, right, right, so
8307880	8311480	But let's say and and I think the issue is yes
8311800	8314600	And and what I'm here what I'm sort of proposing is
8315240	8318040	intelligibility is something like the way
8318680	8322920	Reality is realizing itself and relevance realization is intelligence
8323240	8328120	And the good is the fact that we we trust that the
8328680	8333080	The intelligence can track the intelligibility and by doing that it puts us in touch with the world
8333320	8336120	That's what I was is that a is that a presupposition of faith?
8336760	8341960	Is that a presupposition of the faith that was necessary before the manifestation of a real science?
8342600	8346040	Yes, the willingness to act on that basis. I think if you do not
8346440	8351800	Okay, so I'm not going to I'm not going to deny the importance of the judeo christian story
8352280	8357960	Okay, but I would also say that without fedo's argument about the good
8358440	8363000	As the ongoing fulfillment of the promise that intelligibility tracks realness
8363160	8368120	You can't do science and there's a reason why the scientific revolution is a return to play-doh
8369000	8373640	Galileo rejects Aristotle and goes to play-doh and says play-doh is right
8374120	8381640	Mathematics listen to the words mathematics is the language of reality. There's no math in Aristotelian science for 1200 years
8383160	8385000	It turns to play-doh
8385000	8391000	And that's what brings in the core of why why is that a turn to play-doh particularly? It's because play-doh
8391560	8395160	Like really in the republic play-doh makes the argument that
8395480	8397800	Mathem you he had it over the academy
8397800	8402440	You can't come into the academy unless you can do mathematics because until you do mathematics
8402760	8409640	You can't grasp the kind of intelligibility needed to get at the deepest realities of things and science
8409800	8412920	So you said the math was the cardinal example of that. Yes
8413560	8419080	And all of our science is dependent on math and his his attitude towards myth and narrative is
8419720	8421720	Right
8421720	8429160	That's how to claim about science. Yeah, is that myths and narratives are right that they are indispensable
8429800	8433080	But they do not have the same degree of
8434440	8439640	Revelation of the promise of the good okay that math does i'm not saying i'm agreeing with that
8439800	8441800	Isn't that why also neoplatonism?
8442760	8446440	Could never land right he could never land and become
8447400	8450200	A mode of being for a society
8450600	8453480	It's it's it that's why we've talked about this before a little bit where
8454440	8457320	What christianity does is it provides the body
8458200	8460200	for that which was good of
8460760	8465880	Of the neoplaton platonic tradition and it provides something more to be to be embodied in a
8466280	8472040	In a communion of love and a communion of participation see what what you can't get in neoplatonism
8472440	8478280	And and and although i'm not a christian i prefer christian neoplatonism over pagan neoplatonism because
8478920	8484520	Plato is striving towards the agape and christianity makes this astonishing the two identity claims
8485560	8492600	Both made by john god is the logos and god is agape right and and then that's an identity claim between
8493000	8495000	logos and agape
8495240	8499080	Right it's not to say they're the same, but it's also sustained right
8499800	8503560	And you're gonna say the trinity and i get that right that's fine and i don't object to that
8503800	8507160	But the point i'm making is for me. That's the crucial move
8507800	8509800	Here's what i say in response to that
8509880	8514280	And this is what i mean when i say about neoplatonism is the interesting that you would use the word crucial
8515160	8519000	Yeah, no i think it is i think it is because i go back to my point
8519080	8523880	You can't follow the logos unless agape takes you out of egocentrism
8524360	8531480	Right right i that's right. Yeah, okay, but also agape can't unfold to you unless there's an order and an intelligibility to it
8531640	8536680	It makes no sense to say i love something. Yeah, and there's no intelligibility to it. That doesn't make any sense
8537080	8539080	Right. Yeah, okay
8539320	8545480	Now but you see the thing is and and this is what i when i'm trying to get at with my idea of the intellectual silk road
8545800	8551960	Right that neop, right now our culture the hermetic suspicion were locked into the courtroom of debate
8552600	8556280	I propose that we go back and do what we had with the silk road
8556600	8563880	Which is the courtyard of discussion neoplatonism has this terrific ability to enter into reciprocal reconstruction
8564920	8569320	With christianity clearly it does it with islam, which is what we're doing right now
8569480	8572040	Yes, but it does it with islam and that's how you get suphism
8572440	8575640	It does it with science you if you take a look
8576120	8580680	Read john spencer's book the eternal law you look at what's happening around ironside in that
8580840	8584440	They're all invoking neoplatonic or similar ideas to neoplatonism
8584920	8592840	Neoplatonism at with galalao it's capable of entering into reciprocal reconstruction with science with islam with christianity
8592920	8595480	There seems to be evidence that it can do this with buddhism
8595880	8599400	Taoism that's what thomas plant is arguing was happening on the silk road
8599720	8601000	so
8601000	8605720	What you see as a potential defect i see is a benefit which is it doesn't
8606200	8611320	It doesn't land because it's designed to land in many different ways and allow people
8611320	8616040	Okay, so that's very much related to this idea of apparel a harky if you're abstracting out
8616680	8621880	The set of universal facts then those facts are useful in relationship to
8622360	8624920	The higher order narratives that unite narratives
8625320	8629960	What that's that's exactly. I think that's the claim you just made I I think so let me let me see
8630360	8635000	So what i'm saying is that neoplatonism gets us gives us a way to dispose the furniture of thought
8635320	8639160	That we can come into deep dialogue and it would allow a sufi
8639880	8641400	And it would allow
8641400	8644840	You know a christian to have deep discussion. They don't have to agree
8645240	8649240	The the silk road wasn't dependent on one person running the silk road
8649480	8654680	It was dependent on the fact that all of these civilizations found a way to deeply talk to each other
8654680	8657400	Why the silk road metaphor i'm not i'm too historically
8657560	8663160	I know what the silk road was but why why use that because the silk road binds the east and the west together
8663880	8667880	Right, it's like the golden thread. Yes. It's it's the through line between civilizations
8668040	8674360	Literally, but not just the physical road. There is a philosophical silk road and thomas plant by the way
8674360	8677240	Who is a christian argues that that was neoplatonism?
8679480	8682440	So I think I think in one deep sense
8682760	8686040	Well, there's certainly it certainly is the case that to some degree
8686520	8690360	If science is a derivation of neoplatonism in the way that you described
8690600	8692040	science has also been
8692040	8696600	A uniting methodology and system of apprehension because many different cultures
8697160	8698280	Are willing
8698280	8701240	With different degrees of ability to utilize the scientific method
8701320	8705000	I I agree and I would say that's ultimately exactly for the reasons you just gave
8705560	8708120	Gave because science has has
8709000	8712680	Has sort of made implicit within itself many neoplatonic moves
8714600	8719880	I mean, I think it's interesting. I would say I mean it doesn't bother me so much in the sense that
8720280	8723560	To the extent that that which do play is and present as true
8724200	8728200	I don't have that much of a problem when I read saying maximus. I don't even ask myself
8729080	8732600	You played play doesn't was this Christianity and I'm not saying you should yeah
8732760	8736440	What I'm what I'm saying is and when I read a Sufi, I don't ask myself that question either
8736520	8741160	Like if I read ibn Arabi, I would say yeah, he's saying some pretty powerful true things
8741560	8745240	You know and I can also recognize the the place to which we disagree
8745320	8749720	But he says some definitely powerful things about the nature of reality, which are the
8750280	8753480	Think about the imaginal without ibn Arabi. You won't get it
8753880	8760200	And and if you want to turn to some very good places to talk about agopic love read sufi read some of the sufi
8760360	8762360	you want right like
8762600	8764600	I I want to
8764680	8769480	So you're you're emphasizing this in large part because or I don't want to put words in your mouth
8769560	8771560	But because you also see
8772360	8779560	See, I think the belief in the logos is a precondition for dialogue, right? Yes, but you're making a case for
8780600	8785640	In some sense, it's not a binary definition of logos. It's one that's informed
8786760	8790920	Perhaps properly in equal parts from the tradition of
8791800	8796520	Greece and the it's dipolar. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but there's but there's also
8797640	8800520	There's no reason to assume that there isn't a deeper unity that
8801880	8803880	That both are pointing to
8804360	8807720	I mean, we've been acting out that presupposition in some sense in the west since
8808120	8810120	Since the time of the Renaissance because that was
8810920	8812520	Rome and Greece meeting
8812520	8814440	Jerusalem in a real sense
8814440	8818920	Rome sorry Roman Athens say meeting Jerusalem in a real sense, but it was true way before that
8818920	8825480	I mean that one of the precursors to the Renaissance is the the intellectual reality of Constantinople like new Platonism was just
8826200	8829560	Present was present there the whole time. It just was there
8829960	8834760	And so we know we don't know much about it because the city was destroyed and everything got scattered
8834760	8836200	but the the the
8836200	8842920	Let's say the tradition new Platonism the man in which the one of the important matters in which it reached the west was was through these
8843400	8844440	these
8844440	8850760	Christian scholars that got chased away from the city basically because it was in danger and brought the the text and the tradition to
8850920	8854680	And then there's another and then there's the way it comes from the Arab world too
8855000	8859960	There's sort of multiple time. See what I'm trying to do what I'm proposing is I'm trying to do
8860120	8865640	I'm starting to do like a historical thing where I'm trying to look at all of the ways in which it's like the glass
8865960	8870280	We can get the multi-espectuality of neoplatonism by seeing all the ways it was able to re
8870920	8872920	reciprocally reconstructed itself
8873960	8880040	Like reciprocally reconstruct with with christ with Aristotle or with Christianity or with science or with
8880680	8883560	So you're taking snapshots of that in some sense in the same way
8883560	8888360	I'm trying to do that with the notion of right at the top in the narrative sense using the biblical corpus
8888520	8890520	Exactly and I'm trying to find the through line
8890920	8896120	The historical through line for neoplatonism because I don't this is maybe where Jonathan and I disagree
8896440	8898920	But I think we do it in at least a loving manner
8899720	8906920	Well, or don't understand each other fully. It's possible. It's possible. But what I'm what I guess what I wanted to state is
8908360	8909880	Your metagame
8909880	8912920	Me participating in the dialogue is more important to me than
8913800	8919480	Continuing the right relationship is more valuable to me than coming to the right right. Definitely. Okay. Definitely. So I just wanted to state
8919480	8924200	Oh, yeah. Well, that's a good place to end. I think I mean we've got a long ways through this
8924840	8926040	um
8926040	8928040	We'll try to figure out perhaps
8928920	8933880	After we think about this for a good while what we might do to continue it because there's a few
8934600	8939000	Propositions here that I think are relevant. I just might share them with people that we didn't get to
8939640	8944680	Any hierarchy that is unified is made so by the dominion of a superordinate principle
8945320	8948920	So something has to bring everything together and has to be at the top to unite
8949480	8955480	That principle is most effectively what is common to all that is deemed of comparative relative value within the hierarchy
8955560	8958680	So we talked about the commonality between the good the beautiful and the true
8959320	8961320	the common principle of value
8962280	8968360	Must necessarily be elevated to the highest place in the hierarchy. Well, that's the abstraction of the good
8968760	8973240	Maybe it wouldn't matter if it was neoplatonic or the more Christian notion of the logos and then
8973960	8979240	This is something that you really influenced me in relationship that bringing to the highest place is
8979960	8983320	Personal subordination. So that's above me and I serve it
8983720	8988280	Imitation I want to become that faith. I believe that that principle prevails
8989480	8992120	Which is it's worthy of what would you say?
8993560	8998280	If there's joy in relationship to the recognition of its superordinate place
8999240	9002520	Adulation a variant of that in worship, which is sort of maybe
9003080	9006760	A worship is what combines all of those and so those are propositions
9006760	9010760	Which I would like to impact with you guys and then there's something that's more specifically
9011080	9015160	Judeo-Christian after that, which I won't get into now because I think it would be a distraction
9015880	9016760	so
9016760	9018440	well
9018440	9024440	That's a that's great conversation. I'll come to try on any time for this. Yeah, okay. Well, I think we should we should
9025000	9027000	think about
9027080	9031880	Doing it again. Well, we'll start halfway through and see if we get to the end. I think that would be very good
9032120	9035080	Yeah, well, it's really really see a lot of what we're doing is
9036200	9040600	We're differentiating the propositions, right? It's like well, here's here's the proposition
9040600	9043720	Here's its complexity and there's some real utility and just
9044680	9046680	In just seeing the full complexity
9046840	9048840	walking through it
9048920	9050920	I mean, this is also
9051080	9055160	Right. This is also I think a genuine active fellowship or even friendship because
9055720	9063000	Um, do you the more you do that the more responsive you can make your argument to people who want to engage with it? Of course, of course
9063080	9065160	that's exactly. Well, I mean, we're trying to get to
9066120	9073560	A diverse range of tools that are grounded on something as rock-solid as we can manage. Yeah, so yeah
9075000	9079560	Thanks for writing us. I don't need to have sightings of suspicion. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. That was that was hey
9079560	9083320	My pleasure, man. I'm so glad you guys could come and that we could be together finally
9083800	9088920	In person and I think the conversation was a lot more dynamic and deeper than we would have managed
9089560	9092600	On zoom total. Yeah, I totally agree with that. Yeah, I totally agree
9093240	9095240	All right, great. Thanks, Eric
9095640	9102200	Thank you for all all you who are watching and listening and more to follow on many fronts with any luck
