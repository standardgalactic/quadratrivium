0	22880	Hi, everybody. I'm pleased today to be talking with
22880	30800	Jaco Willink, who I've talked with on his podcast on three separate occasions. I don't think I've had
30800	37680	Jaco on mind. And my memory isn't what it should be. So but I'm quite sure that we've so far when
37680	42560	we've talked, it's been on your podcast. So I thought I'd take the time today to get to know you
42560	49600	in some more detail. Jaco is an American author, podcaster, and retired naval officer who served
49600	55200	in the Navy SEALs. He coauthored the book's Extreme Ownership and the Dichotomy of Leadership
55840	63040	with fellow retired SEAL Leif Babin. Did I pronounce that right? It's actually Leif Babin.
63040	68080	Oh, so I didn't pronounce it right at all. Leif Babin. He hosts a weekly podcast with Brazilian
68080	73920	jiu-jitsu practitioner, Echo Charles, called the Jaco podcast. He has a million subscribers on
73920	79680	YouTube, and his podcast attracts many more listeners. He co-founded the management consulting
79680	85360	firm Echelon Front, LLC, and has extended his business development on a number of additional
85360	91840	fronts. His military service included combat actions in the war in Iraq, where he eventually
91840	97760	commanded the SEAL teams three task unit bruiser that fought in the battle against the Iraqi
97760	104560	insurgents in Ramadi, and was honored with the Silver Star and Bronze Star for his service.
104560	110960	He achieved the rank of Lieutenant Commander. Good to see you again, Jaco.
111760	118800	It's good to be here. Yeah, I feel the same way that it's good to be here. I'm really looking
118800	126880	forward to our conversation. I'm glad that you were able to gut through that ridiculously long bio,
126880	133600	and I felt that as you got to the end of it, you are breaking free of the chains of that reading.
133600	139280	So I'm glad it's over with. Yeah, well, it's so much better just to talk than to read in this sort
139280	146080	of format, but at least everybody who doesn't know already has some sense of who you are, some
146720	154400	minimal sense of who you are. So tell me what's been happening online with you over the last
154880	158880	couple of years, because we haven't spoken, I would say it's got to be two years, I think,
158880	167840	something like that. And so I've cast an eye on what's been happening with you on YouTube, and
167840	173600	some of my staff have filled me in, but I'm really curious. Tell me about what's happening with your
173600	180480	YouTube channel and your online activities, your podcast and all of that. Yeah, a few years ago,
180480	186560	I started a podcast. That was actually, it was quite a few years ago now, it was in 2015.
187200	193520	It might have been kind of as the explosion of prior to the explosion of podcasts. In fact,
193520	199360	I think I read something that said, at that time, it was like 17% of Americans were listening to
199360	207120	podcasts and that number is much, much higher now. And I kind of got lucky because at the time,
208080	212000	Tim Ferriss had one of the most popular, still very popular, but at the time,
212000	217520	just because the numbers of podcasts that existed, his podcast was even more popular.
217520	224640	And I went on his podcast and when we got done recording and he pressed stop on the record
224640	228880	button, he looked at me and said, you should have your own podcast. And I kind of took that
229840	235920	and noted it. And then a little while later, I was on Joe Rogan's podcast and he had,
236480	241120	you know, obviously another one of the most popular podcasts in the world.
241120	244960	And he told me in the middle of that podcast that I should have my own podcast.
244960	249360	And so when guys like Tim Ferriss and Joe Rogan are telling you to have your own podcast,
249360	254160	you have your own podcast. Now, I came to realize later that Joe Rogan actually would tell everybody
254160	259280	to have a podcast. So maybe he would tell everyone, oh, you should start a podcast. Well,
259280	267200	I actually listened to him. And so I started that podcast. And I would say I probably, if
267200	272560	somebody would have asked, you know, what should a person do to make a good podcast or
273760	276880	maybe not a good podcast, but a popular podcast, somebody would probably say,
278160	283840	make it probably a half an hour to an hour, bring a bunch of different guests on so that you can
283840	290000	hear a bunch of deep bunch of different people talking and, you know, talk about positive things
290000	296640	in the world. And so instead of doing any of that, what I did was I have a podcast that's between
296640	303600	two and five hours long. Oftentimes it's just me talking, reading from a book and reviewing a book.
304480	309920	And usually the books are about war or suffering or some kind of human atrocity.
310000	313760	And so that's what my podcast is. And really what it boils down to is it's
315520	320880	learning about human nature. And for me, human nature is best revealed or most clearly revealed
320880	327280	in times of suffering. And one of the, I guess, pretty good monopoly on the market for suffering
327280	334000	is war and right in there as well as, you know, human atrocities. So I started that podcast.
334000	338640	And like I said, when I started it, there weren't that many, there weren't as many as podcasts as
338640	345760	there are now. So it got some traction out of the gate and it kind of just stayed there.
346400	350480	So I was very lucky in that respect. And I've been doing ever since I've,
350480	358480	I've put out one podcast a week for five years. I've only missed one, one week in there. And
358480	364240	that was when my best friend was killed in a parachute accident. And so I didn't put out a
364240	372160	podcast that week. But other than that, I've been very consistent. And then the YouTube channel is,
372720	378880	well, it's, it's kind of the podcast. And then we do some excerpts there and little clips and
378880	384480	stuff like that. And Echo Charles, I forget what you called him in the bio, a Brazilian jiu-jitsu
384480	393520	practitioner. He's also a video guy. And so he makes his little, he makes little clips and puts
393600	398800	special effects in them and stuff because he's creative and bored, which means
398800	402080	it's a great combination for someone that you're, that you're working with.
402720	409760	It is indeed. So I think that's what's been happening online for me and for the past few years.
410400	414160	Who, who do you, who's your audience? Do you think, or do you know?
415440	422480	Yeah, I know actually quite well that my, my demographic is people. It's people, it's human
422480	427280	beings. Really, it's, it's all over the place. And when I go and do live events, I'll have
428240	432400	just the entire spectrum of humans there. Hey, look, is there a, is there a,
433440	437280	you know, kind of a typical person? Yeah, there's a typical person, but we get everybody on the
437280	441760	spectrum from the grandma to the, the little kids, you know, I've written a bunch of kids' books
441760	446400	and the little kids show up as well. Right. Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty kids' books.
447120	452240	Yeah, pretty broad demographic. That's, I meet all kinds of people. Everybody from a,
452880	460640	I'll meet a firefighter and then a hedge fund guy and then a stay at home mom and then a retired
460640	463920	Marine. It just meet everybody. It's, and that's the audience.
464560	469440	Do you, do you have any sense of what it is that's attracting people to your podcast? I mean,
470400	475680	you, you, you sort of approached that tongue and cheek in some sense for, for a dark topic,
475680	480480	you know, you concentrate on things that are, that are pretty negative or they're pretty dark.
480480	486240	And so as you said, that might fly in the face of any advice you'd get about what to talk about.
486240	490640	But obviously, I mean, one of the things I've encountered is that there's a very,
490640	496240	there's a vast hunger for serious dialogue. And I mean, one of the things that struck me
496240	500640	always about your podcast was you often read something that's very, very
501600	508400	emotionally demanding, stark, harsh, rough. And
510800	513520	well, and it's interesting to think about why people might
514320	518400	be attracted to that. What's your sense? And also, why are you doing it?
518400	534080	I think that it's emotional. I think that these are emotional topics.
534080	540400	I think these are things that people can be a little bit afraid of and a little bit nervous
540400	545280	about and being able to brush up against them a little bit gives them a little bit more
546080	551360	familiarity with them. And therefore, when you see, when you come close to things that are
551360	555760	that stark and dark and horrible, it also makes you look up around at the present situation
555760	560720	that you're in and maybe it doesn't look as awful. Yeah, so.
561280	565520	So there you touched on two things about knowing something about history that might be really
565520	572640	useful or about human affairs, right? One is that, I mean, it's a tenant of clinical psychotherapy
572640	580400	that a voluntary approach to what's frightening, threatening, even disgusting is curative. It has
580400	585600	to be voluntary. And it can't be too intense, right? Because if it gets too intense, it can
585600	590960	actually hurt you. But if it's voluntary and measured, that actually seems to strengthen
590960	596480	people, it develops resilience. And I would say that's one thing that virtually all well-trained
596480	604400	clinicians agree on is that that kind of exposure, whether it's discussing old difficult experiences
604400	608480	in an autobiographical manner, or whether it's actually going out into the world and
609120	613920	facing things that you're afraid of, if you're an elevator phobic, for example, you might be faced
613920	618240	with confronted with the necessity of at least looking at an elevator, which is something you
618240	624480	might avoid if you're phobic. And then so that's the first thing. So there is some pronounced human
624480	633120	tendency to be attracted to what's dark, because that is a pathway to mental and physical resilience.
633120	636720	And then the second thing is, which I also think is extremely important is
638080	645280	it's useful to cultivate gratitude in my estimation. And one of the ways that you can do that, because
645280	650640	you take a lot of what's good in your life for granted, it gets invisible, especially if it's
650640	655680	predictable, it gets invisible. And that's unfortunate, because it's still rare and precious.
657600	665120	And if you know how terrible things can be, have been or could become, then that can alert you
665120	671040	to how fortunate you are when all hell isn't breaking loose right now, everywhere in your life.
672000	681440	So, yeah, and you can also sort of learn some skill sets of how to handle these tough situations
681440	687520	when you get in them. And if you can see that someone went through something that's much worse,
687520	690960	and what did they do to deal with it? How did they get through it? What did they think about?
690960	696000	What did they do? You can say, okay, well, I've seen that before. And the situation,
696080	702320	amen, isn't quite as bad. But I know that that person took action. I know that person stood up
702320	706960	and made a move and made things happen and tried to move forward. And maybe that's what I should
706960	715280	do too. So you can definitely garner some skills from the past. Right. So that's a third element,
715280	722240	is that it can expand your notion of human competence. And that's, I think that's partly,
722240	728000	that's one of the reasons that people love watching high end sports performances.
729040	733840	Because you think, well, look, that's what a human being is capable of. Isn't that
734480	741760	so remarkable? And I am one of those. And so that's a limit case. But there's obviously room
741760	746960	for me to develop. And that's something that's very hopeful. And so if you are in dire straits and
746960	751840	you've seen that other people can get through that, you think, well, maybe I could get through that
751840	758000	if I could just learn how to do it. So I had a guy on my podcast who had written a book. His name
758000	766080	was William Reeder. And he had, he was a helicopter pilot in Vietnam. And he was shot down. Well,
766080	769200	he shot down two times. The first time he was shot down, he was able to make it back to friendly
769200	774640	lines. The second time he was shot down, he was captured. And he was captured in South Vietnam,
774640	779520	which is actually worse. You didn't want to get captured in South Vietnam, because then they
779520	784640	had to get you to North Vietnam to the prison. And getting to North Vietnam while you're patrolling
784640	793920	through the jungle for months on end is not a good thing. And at one point, he's in a two foot
793920	803920	tall bamboo cage in the jungle. And his legs are shackled. And it's nighttime. And he's trying to
803920	811040	sleep, but he's having trouble sleeping because the rats are gnawing at the wounds on his legs.
814160	823920	And so knowing that someone could suffer through that and survive and get through and make it out
823920	832960	the other side and then carry on with a completely productive life tells me that we are pretty resilient
833040	837200	as a species if we can dig deep and find that resiliency.
838080	844320	Yes. Well, that's exactly the kind of story that also makes you much appreciative of the fact that
844320	850960	you have a bed in an air conditioned room that in a house in a town that's not burning to the
850960	857200	ground with rioters. And you have that every night. And so you take it for granted, but
858160	863120	but it's still worth noting that it's a kind of miracle compared to all the alternatives that might
863120	869280	manifest themselves. Yeah, I think people appreciate that. I think people, you know, look, how many
869280	873680	movies have been made about war, countless movies have been made about war, countless books have
873680	878640	been written about war. So human beings are definitely have some sort of a, I don't know if
878640	886240	it's a fascination or at least an appreciation for the sacrifice and the effort that goes into
886400	895920	fighting a war. And I will tell you, and I can't speak for everybody, but certainly me and the
895920	900320	kids I, many of the kids I grew up with, and then many of the people that I served with,
901520	906560	that's what we wanted to do. We had some kind, I had some kind of an instinct. That's such a great
906560	915120	thing for you to be able to say, you know, because there's there, I remember watching this kid once
915120	919360	I saw him in Montreal, and he was standing, he's a big kid, about six, five, I would think, and
920080	924560	he was wearing these punk boots that were like military knockoffs, essentially. And
926400	930800	he was standing there, he's about 17 or 18, and he's standing there on the corner of this outdoor
930800	934640	shopping mall carrying these two pink shopping bags and looking completely out of place. And I
934640	940320	thought, you know, if you went there and offered that kid a chance to go off and have an adventure,
940400	945680	you know, to have a battle, he dropped those shopping bags and be gone in two seconds because
945680	950400	he wants something more than to be, he's not built for that. It was so incongruous, you know,
950400	956320	he wasn't built for that. And William James, the American philosopher, said that we needed a moral
956320	965280	equivalent to war, because war calls people to extremes, right, to the extremes in their life.
966160	972080	And there's something about that that was obviously compelling, as you, as you say,
973360	979920	it's uncomfortable as well to, to, to state that blatantly, because obviously peace is a
979920	985920	desirable condition. But the question is then, well, how do you put sufficient adventure into the
985920	990960	peace? And that's a very, very, that's a very complicated problem.
993760	1001360	Yeah, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's very true in the fact that in war, I was lucky enough
1001360	1009520	to go and I was lucky enough to serve in, in combat and to be in a position of leadership in
1009520	1018720	combat. And in those situations, I was able to witness with my own eyes, on the one hand,
1018720	1027280	the most heinous and despicable acts that human beings can partake in. And I was also able to
1027280	1034960	witness with my own two eyes, these soldiers, Marines, the guys that were in my task unit,
1034960	1043680	making the most incredible sacrifices for their friends. So yes, there is an extreme
1043680	1050480	to war. And like you said, it's not something you wish on anybody. And I had this conversation
1050480	1056080	with Sam Harris a while ago, because he called me out and said, you know, you're talking about how
1056080	1061120	hard war is, and it's terrible. But at the same time, you say it's the best thing that you have
1061120	1067440	been through. And I, I asked him if he'd ever known anyone that had cancer and survived it.
1068160	1075200	And oftentimes those people will say, it's the best thing that happened to me. I wouldn't wish it
1075200	1080640	on anybody, but I'm glad it happened to me. And that's kind of how I feel about war too. I wouldn't
1080640	1085840	wish war on anybody, but I am, I wouldn't, I wouldn't trade it for anything.
1086480	1097040	So when you look, when you look back on your involvement in the war in Iraq and your country's
1097040	1104240	involvement, what, what do you make? How do you make sense out of it morally? I mean, we're in
1104240	1108880	that domain right now, you know, you tell, tell me already that you're pulled between these extreme
1108880	1114400	views. You don't wish war on anyone. I'm, I mean, if you have, do you have a son?
1115200	1118320	Yes. How old is he? 18.
1120640	1129200	Well, so, so then you think I presume, but I, or perhaps I wouldn't, I wouldn't deign to presume
1131760	1136960	if you could have what you wanted for him. Would that be peace?
1139840	1145440	Of course. Okay. Okay. Well, that, right. Well, okay. So, so let's have a little bit.
1145440	1153600	Of course, of course, but. Well, right. Right. Exactly. Well, the other thing,
1153600	1158000	the other thing that you do as far as please correct me if I get any of this wrong, but
1158000	1165840	I mean, part of what you're also offering to people is the, is the call of a kind of radical
1165920	1172160	discipline. Right. Now you post on Instagram, your, the times you wake up in the morning,
1173200	1183120	correct? Yes. 430, something like that. And pretty regularly. And I guess you do that to show people
1183120	1192080	that you can get the hell out of bed at 430 and get your day going. And. Yeah, maybe not. I would
1192080	1198640	love to tell you that I was that, um, had that much for forethought into when I started doing that,
1198640	1204560	but I was on Tim Ferriss's podcast and he told me I should join Twitter. And I kind of said,
1204560	1208880	what's that? And he showed it to me a little bit and he said, you really should join this. It's a
1208880	1214000	way you can communicate with people. And I said, okay, fair enough. So I signed up for Twitter and
1215040	1220400	whatever the next day I woke up in the morning and didn't know what to write or what to do.
1220400	1225200	So I just took a picture of my watch and, you know, here I go. And other people kind of noticed
1225200	1232240	that. And so that's kind of how that whole thing started. But yeah, well, it's not, it's not always
1232240	1236960	the case that when you do something new and creative, you know, why you do it. I mean,
1236960	1241680	sometimes you have, you've, and even if you think you know why you do it, you might find out five
1241680	1245680	years later that there were 10 other reasons that you did it that you weren't aware of at the time.
1245680	1251520	Like we live beyond ourselves all the time. That's especially true if you're entrepreneurial and
1251520	1256960	creative because you're changing who you are all the time. And there's no reason to assume
1256960	1265040	that your understanding of yourself would keep up with the changes. So my take on the Instagram
1265040	1270640	posts was, well, what I just, what I just mentioned, it's like, well, you know, yeah, you can sleep
1270640	1274560	until 10 o'clock in the morning if you want, but you can also get a jump on the day. And
1274560	1279520	I think part of what makes your, I think part of what makes what you're doing attractive
1280080	1286720	is that there's so little emphasis in our popular culture, especially, especially with regards to
1286720	1293040	the so-called mainstream media on discipline and responsibility, that there's a tremendous
1293040	1299520	hunger for anything that pertains to that. And you have a right to be discussing that, I would say,
1299600	1305840	because of your, because of your background, which if nothing else required a tremendous
1305840	1311760	amount of discipline. Yeah. And I ended up writing a book called Discipline Equals Freedom.
1311760	1316400	And I'm lucky that I wrote it when I did, because if I would have written it two years later,
1316400	1321600	everyone would have said, oh, everyone's talking about discipline now. So yeah, discipline,
1321600	1325680	absolutely. Discipline does bring you freedom in life. And that's something that I kind of
1325680	1330960	figured out over time. Well, so what do you mean by that? Like, how did you figure that out? And
1330960	1336640	what do you mean by that? Because they're often, and you know, the classic sort of, what would you
1336640	1345840	call it, romantic rebel is someone who has, is free from excessive order, let's say. They don't see,
1345840	1353280	they see freedom and discipline as antithetical rather than seeing one as a precondition for the
1353280	1361440	other. And so, so how did you learn that discipline was a precondition for freedom? If I've, if I've
1361440	1368720	got the equation, how did that manifest itself in your own life? So we'll start off by saying this,
1368720	1373920	and look, I was a young kid, I joined the Navy to go in the SEAL teams, I went through SEAL training,
1373920	1379360	I showed up at a SEAL team, SEAL team one. And when I got there, and as I look back,
1379600	1388000	this is a very powerful thing, even though it's very simple. When I was, so I'm 19 years old when
1388000	1396080	I show up at SEAL team one, I'm done with the basic SEAL training. And I have a goal in my head,
1396800	1405520	which is that, which is this, I want to be a good SEAL. That's what I want to do. That's like,
1405520	1411040	I don't know about anything else. This is what I want to do. I want to be a good SEAL. That's
1411040	1419200	what I want. I want to be a good SEAL. And so as a 19 year old with all kinds of energy, and we
1419200	1423280	haven't talked about my childhood yet, but I was kind of like a very rebellious kid when you talked
1423280	1429280	about seeing a kid that looked like you could have handed him a club or a battle axe, and he
1429280	1433280	would have probably been feeling a little bit better. I was like that. I was constantly looking
1433280	1438720	around for a club or a battle axe, because that's what I felt like I needed to do. And it was beautiful
1438720	1445040	because I was running around the, running around the woods as a young kid playing army. And I
1445760	1450880	just went and actually played army. You know, that's what I ended up doing. So I never really had to
1450880	1456640	do, do, you know, force myself into some mold that I didn't want to be into. So I got to SEAL team
1456640	1463760	one. And now I just want to be a good SEAL. That's what I want. And so now that starts steering some
1463760	1470640	of my decisions. And for the most part, it steered my decisions in a decent direction. Now there were
1470640	1478400	sometimes where as I look back now, what I thought was a good SEAL was a little bit off, but luckily
1478400	1483120	it wasn't 180 degrees off. It might have been 30 degrees or 40 degrees. And as I got older and more
1483120	1488800	mature and I figured out more about what that ideal should look like to me. And I could keep
1488800	1495760	chasing that ideal. That was good. But even to be even to be a 19 year old kid with a with a 70
1495760	1503840	or 80 degree corridor to move forward in is not a bad thing. No, it's a gift. It's a gift. Exactly.
1504560	1512480	So then I'm looking around at other SEALs that were older than me and more senior to me and trying
1512480	1519360	to figure out which one of those guys is a good SEAL. Yeah. And what I realized was that the guys
1519360	1525520	that were working harder, for the most part, were good SEALs. Now there were, look, there's just
1525520	1531360	some people that are just way talented. Right. It could show up, you know, three minutes before a run
1531360	1536160	or three minutes before we do a shooting competition, and they could just walk through it. No problem.
1536160	1541760	Right. And that's great for them. It wasn't me. I wasn't, I'm not that great at anything.
1541760	1546400	But I saw other guys that might not be a great at anything either, but they worked hard.
1546400	1550320	They showed up to work early. They did the drills that they were supposed to do.
1550320	1557120	They had discipline. And when you have a SEAL has amalgamated statistics. I hope I get this right,
1557120	1564880	but it's approximately correct. If you work 10% longer hours, you make 40% more money.
1566080	1570480	Right. And so and I think your comments about talent are also dead on. It's like,
1570480	1574000	in any field of enterprise, there are people who are phenomenally gifted.
1574960	1579920	And, and then if they work really hard, they're even more phenomenally gifted. Right. Those are
1579920	1589920	the people who break records. But that talent apart, hard work actually works. And with virtually
1589920	1595440	everything, it might not make you the best at whatever it is you're pursuing, but it will
1595440	1601120	certainly make you better than you are. And, and then I have in this, I have this new book.
1601120	1606400	I hope you got a copy because we, did you get a copy? Okay. So I'm bringing it up for a particular
1606400	1611840	reason. I have a chapter in this book called, well, there's two that are relevant. Imagine who
1611840	1617360	you could be and then aim single-mindedly at that. That's one. And then the course, or what would
1617360	1624880	you call it? A complimentary chapter is work as hard as you possibly can on one thing and see
1624880	1629680	what happens. And that's also predicated on this idea that discipline is a precondition to freedom.
1630240	1634960	So, so you were fortunate like you had this goal, right? So that meant you had a goal,
1634960	1639200	which is a really big deal, because you could learn about goals. You had a sense of
1640640	1646240	what a higher mode of moral being that I would rather be a good seal than the person I am now.
1646240	1651040	Well, it's a, it's a code of behavior and a way of perceiving. So there's an ethic in that. And
1651040	1657360	then you said as well, you know, your conception of what good seal meant changed as you matured.
1657920	1662320	But that's also fine. It wouldn't have changed unless you would have pursued that initial
1663280	1668240	only partially accurate goal. And so that's also a really good thing for people to understand is like,
1669520	1675200	if you don't know what you're doing, aim at something. Is it the right thing? No. But it's
1675200	1679920	better than just shooting randomly. So you aim at something and then as you aim and you move towards
1679920	1686240	it, you're going to find out why you're wrong. And then you might recalibrate your aim. And that's
1686240	1690800	going to happen over and over because as you move towards a goal, it recedes or it broadens or it
1690800	1696880	recedes and broadens. And otherwise you'd run out of things to do. So, but anyways, back to the,
1696880	1702560	back to the story, you're, you, you have this, this, this identity and you said it was, it was
1702560	1707360	there in you all right from the beginning, because you would play army in, in the, by yourself even
1707920	1712160	in the, in the, in the forest by your house, I presume. And how, how old were you? Do you think
1712160	1721680	when, how long back can you remember having that as a fascination? I do not remember wanting to do
1721680	1732080	anything else. So would you say what is as early, is that as early as four, three,
1732080	1736000	five preschool, something like that? Can you remember playing when you were that young?
1736000	1745920	I, I can't remember, you know, a specific age, but if I think back to, hey,
1746880	1752080	that looks like what I want to do. I remember, I want to be a soldier.
1752880	1757120	And do you, okay, you remember when you were a kid? I mean, I'm fascinated by this because
1757840	1762560	one of the things I really noted when I had kids was how much their personality was there
1762560	1766960	right from the beginning. Like my children are quite different. They have their similarities,
1766960	1770960	but they're quite different from one another. And those differences were there right from the
1770960	1776320	beginning and they've maintained themselves throughout their lives. And so it's fascinating to
1776320	1782000	see that, that destiny in some sense is built right into the person to begin with. And so,
1782000	1789760	while this was built into you by all appearances, and so it manifested it in itself in what attracted
1789760	1795120	you even in play as a, as a child. And that's the beginning of identity formulation, that, that
1795120	1801200	play. And so what was it about being a soldier that you think attracted you when you were a kid?
1801200	1806080	Like what, what was it that was so compelling? Because being a soldier is a multi-dimensional
1806080	1811840	identity. There's, there's, there's the, the, the physical combat element of it. There's the
1811840	1818320	strategic element of it. There's the, the discipline, the camaraderie. What, what were you playing,
1818320	1825360	do you think? I got asked this, I was talking to some folks at the special operations command
1826160	1831040	the other day and they asked me, they set me up with this kind of beautiful
1833200	1837920	possibility or opportunity for me to give some kind of an incredibly beautiful
1838560	1843360	answer to this very question, you know, and there was something along the lines of,
1843600	1851120	you know, at what point did the, did the opportunity to serve and sacrifice for your country
1851920	1857600	reveal itself to you or something along that, those lines. And all I'm thinking about is when I'm
1858640	1864480	eight years old, 12 years old, 15 years old, I want a machine gun and I want to go fight
1864480	1868400	in a war. That's what I want to do. I would love to tell you, I would love to tell you that I,
1869040	1875280	you know, read some heroic book. I read the odyssey and, and realized that I don't need to
1875280	1879840	read any of that stuff. Well, that wouldn't be wrong to do with eight anyways, right? I mean,
1879840	1884960	that's why I'm curious about what it was so early, you know, and so, okay, so for you,
1884960	1889840	it had something to do with weaponry, apparently, I got to tell you a story about my father, okay,
1889840	1895280	and tell me if this act, we like produces any echoes before you go. Yep.
1896240	1902640	Weaponry was like, for sure, that's fine, but it could be a club. It wasn't, it wasn't, I wasn't
1902640	1909200	a kid that was obsessed with guns. Okay. It was, and maybe it was just we're going to get out and,
1909200	1914720	and run around with sticks and try and hit each other or get into rock fights.
1915520	1921280	Do you ever have rock fights? Well, we, we had ice fights, because it was northern Alberta,
1921280	1926000	but also dirt lump fights. And now and then those would have rocks. And I can remember,
1927440	1932240	it was usually the Protestant kids against the Catholic kids. I mean, there wasn't that much
1932240	1937360	of a division between those two in our town, but the Catholic kids had their junior high and high
1937360	1944400	school and we had ours. And so our gangs were separate. And so we would have dirt lump fights
1944400	1948960	in the vacant lots where buildings were being constructed. And those were extremely exciting.
1948960	1952960	You know, now, and then you'd take a dirt lump rock in the mouth and that was a little bit on
1952960	1958960	the painful side. And, but, but, but there's no doubt that it was extremely exciting. And so,
1959520	1964080	and, you know, I cut you off about your dad and the gun. Well, my dad told me something,
1964080	1970320	and then this might be more relevant to, to, to guns, but my dad collects single shot rifles.
1970320	1975920	And he has a lot of them, like hundreds of them. And he's a gunsmith and, and makes stalks and
1976000	1982560	hand carves them. And anyways, he's, he's an artisan in that regard. And it's really, it's a,
1982560	1986640	it's a real focal obsession. He's a great shot. He shot at the provincial level,
1986640	1993200	which would be the state level in the US. But it was single shots and, and he hunted. And so we
1993200	1997760	grew up on moose meat and elk meat. And, and he brought elk into Northern Alberta as part of a
1998720	2005520	repopulation attempt. Anyways, I thought for, I could never understand his fascination with,
2005520	2010400	with guns, because it was really a deep fascination. So it was, it was something that
2010400	2017600	elicited my curiosity. And at one point I realized that he only hunted with single shots.
2018560	2023680	So he had one shot at whatever he was hunting. So it had to be a good shot. And so he was pushing
2023680	2029200	himself. And then I realized, well, he was really obsessed with hitting the target, taking aim
2029200	2035040	and hitting the target. And it was about that time I learned that the Greek word for, for sin,
2035040	2041760	hamartia meant to miss the target. So there's this tight alignment between taking careful aim
2041760	2047840	at the center of something precisely, and then bringing yourself into alignment so that you would
2047840	2053280	hit that target. There's a deep morality in that. It's a morality of hunting. It might be a
2053280	2059120	morality of combat. And it's really deeply embedded inside of people. And that was what had my father
2060160	2067120	in its grip. And so I would, I was wondering if the, if, if you're, if you're
2069200	2076000	the automatic interest that, that even the club elicited in you had something to do with that,
2076000	2081680	that seeking, that hunting, that, that target seeking, or if, you know, perhaps I'm barking up
2081680	2090640	the wrong tree, I would say. No, but when you, when you were talking about getting hit in the
2090640	2096800	head with a dirt clump and whether you get hit or not, when you get done with that situation,
2097600	2106160	you are in an elevated state of mind because that was dangerous. And it was a very high level
2106240	2112960	competition. Because even when you're throwing a baseball or, or, you know, kicking a soccer ball
2112960	2120560	around, there's no real danger in that situation. But when someone's hucking dirt clumps at your head,
2121360	2130240	you get a legitimate rush from that. And it feels good. And it feels it's exhilarating. One of the
2130240	2134240	most fun, yes, if there's no doubt that it's exhilarating, one of the most fun days I ever
2134240	2144080	had as a child, this was less dangerous. I lived next door to a policeman, an RCMP officer. And
2144720	2152320	we went out one day, I was probably about eight into my neighbor's backyard. And she had green
2152320	2157680	tomatoes everywhere, far more than she was ever going to eat. And we had a green tomato war
2157680	2163360	for like an hour and a half. And he was moving them at a pretty good velocity. So if they caught you,
2163360	2171040	especially in the head, you know, you kind of remembered it. But it was exhilarating. And it
2171040	2176480	was really fun to engage in that with him. And I really do remember that. And I do remember those,
2177040	2182400	I hadn't until today, but I do remember those dirt lump wars. And there is an exhilaration in
2182400	2188080	pushing yourself like that. So. And I also don't, I don't want to give the impression that I was,
2188880	2194480	you know, running around with camouflage paint going to high school, or I was, you know, I was
2194480	2200160	doing a bunch of other stuff too. I played soccer, I played basketball. I, we had, you know, a bunch
2200160	2205680	of different bands, we played music, I played bass in a band, I sang in a band, I played guitar.
2205680	2212320	We did all kinds of other stuff. But I was always kind of just in the back of my mind sort of
2212560	2222080	wanted to do that job. All right. So you went to the seals. And tell us about that a bit.
2224800	2235440	It was awesome. You know, it's your, you're making more money than you could ever figure out to do
2235440	2241360	with, you know, I'm 19 years old, and I am the richest person that's ever existed in my mind,
2241360	2248240	because I'm making whatever it is, however many thousand dollars every two weeks. And you know,
2248240	2254640	my expenses were nothing. And so you're just totally stoked. You're getting, you got a great job.
2254640	2259520	You're working out, you're shooting machine guns, you're blowing things up, you're hanging out with
2259520	2265680	a bunch of, bunch of other guys that like to blow things up and you, you, you can fight each other
2265680	2270400	at the drop of a hat. And then you get done with a fight and you shake hands and then, and then you
2270400	2278720	go eat a steak. And so you're just in this environment and it's perfect. It's, it's freaking
2278720	2286160	awesome. So what was it like? It was awesome. That's what it was like. It's funny. You read
2286160	2292400	accounts of the Navy SEALs and I've never read it as enthusiastic an account as that account right
2292400	2297680	there. And so then how long after you, what happened after you were done your Naval SEAL,
2297680	2301440	Naval SEAL training? What, what direction did your military career take?
2301440	2305280	Yes. So I got done with SEAL training. I went to SEAL team one. It was 1991. I just
2305280	2310720	missed the first golf war. I was all brokenhearted about that because this war had happened and I
2310720	2317760	didn't know when another one was going to happen. And so what do you do is you train and, and we
2317760	2323920	trained a bunch. I did a bunch of SEAL platoons, which is you form up with a group of guys, you
2323920	2329040	do a training cycle together as a platoon and then you go on deployment overseas. And when
2329040	2333920	there's no war going on, you go to other countries and you work with foreign nationals and you train
2333920	2339520	them on the skill sets that we have and learn some stuff from them. And then you come back and you do
2339520	2345760	it again. And then eventually from there, I went into a, where I became a trainer at SEAL team one
2346800	2352160	and taught the tactics to the SEAL platoons that were now training to go on deployment.
2352160	2356320	And I did that for a couple of years. And then I got picked up for a commissioning program
2356320	2360400	and became an officer in the SEAL teams, which moved me up into a leadership position.
2361120	2366400	And then I did a couple of deployments as a young SEAL leader. Then I had to go to college. The
2366400	2370800	Navy sent me to college because in order to be an officer in the, in the Navy, you have to go to
2370800	2375120	college and I hadn't been to college. So I went to the University of San Diego.
2375920	2378160	You went to the University of San Diego. What did you take there?
2378880	2380400	I, I was an English major.
2383120	2385280	All right. So you finished college and then what happened?
2386000	2387760	You're not going to ask me why I was an English major?
2388640	2390240	Why were you an English major?
2390880	2394080	I thought when he hears English major, he's going to say, wait a second,
2394080	2397360	here you are, this guy talking about machine guns and blowing things up.
2397360	2399520	What in God's name are you going to go study English for?
2399520	2402720	I have to say that that thought did pass through my mind.
2402800	2408960	Okay. Why was I an English major? I was an English major because believe it or not,
2409600	2413520	when you're in the SEAL teams and especially when you're in any officer position,
2414640	2421920	you have to write and read all the time. So when one of your troops does something and
2421920	2426160	they deserve some kind of recognition for that, you have to write them an award.
2426160	2429040	And if the award is written well, there's a much better chance that it'll actually
2429680	2432480	that be given to the person that you're writing it for.
2432480	2437440	You have to write evaluations for your troops and the evaluations that you write
2438800	2442000	is how your troops are judged so that they can be promoted.
2442640	2449520	On top of that, if you want to go do a mission, you have to write a concept of operations,
2449520	2454640	which is a document, which is five, six, seven, eight pages long,
2454640	2459280	that you send up the chain of command that then they scour through and see if they're
2459280	2462640	going to prove your mission or not. That's so insanely important.
2463680	2473600	One of the things, I did a talk at Harvard four years ago and I pointed out two things to the
2473600	2481680	students in the audience. One was that a tremendous amount of civilization and effort had gone into
2481680	2487760	producing the institution that they were now part of and that everyone who was part of that
2487760	2492560	institution was hoping that they would come there and learn everything they possibly could
2492560	2496960	that was relevant and important and that they would be the best possible people they could be
2496960	2501120	and they would go out in the world and do as much good as they possibly could.
2501120	2506800	That was the essential mission of the enterprise and that was really the case.
2507760	2515120	Also, that learning to write in particular was going to make them more powerful than they could
2515120	2521280	imagine and a number of students came up to me afterwards and said, I really wish someone would
2521280	2526720	have said that to us when we first came here. It's the writing part of that. I kind of got
2526720	2532480	obsessed with that when I was working as a professor and I'm working on a piece of software right now
2532560	2539600	to help, which we'll launch soon, to help people write because what I observed in my own career
2539600	2544320	and it's so interesting, the parallelism is so interesting but not surprising, is that
2544880	2549840	nothing can stop you if you can write and it's for the reasons you just laid out. It's like
2551280	2556480	when you write, you make a case for something, whatever it happens to be and if you make the
2556480	2562960	best case, well then you win and you get whatever it is that you're aiming at and so
2563760	2568880	you said maybe that's why I didn't ask you why you went into English. I guess that might have
2568880	2574160	been the reason is that the utility of learning to write is so self-evident to me that it could
2574160	2580320	pass by without question but it's also interesting to think about how it fits into this broader,
2581120	2585920	well let's say at least partially military slash strategic way of looking at things.
2587120	2592800	You describe the intense relationship between marshalling your arguments properly,
2592800	2599680	getting everything in order on the page and making strategic progress truly in the military sense
2599680	2604400	that those things are tied together very, very precisely and it's obviously your ability to
2604400	2609920	communicate as well that's, well look what it's done. You have your podcast, you have your YouTube
2609920	2615360	channel, you have your books which many of which you self-published so that ability to communicate
2615360	2621920	is it's, I just can't understand why it's not presented especially, not entirely but especially
2621920	2627200	to adventurous, well let's say young men, we could say young people. You're adventurous,
2627920	2633200	you want to make a mark, is you bloody well better learn how to write because if you learn how to
2633200	2637440	write well then you can think and you can communicate your thoughts so not only are you
2637440	2642640	deadly strategically, you become extremely convincing and then you can go and do anything
2642640	2651280	you want and no one will stop you and that's never told to people and I don't really understand why.
2651280	2656240	You know you hear the pen is mightier than the sword which is just a cliche unless it's fleshed
2656240	2662720	out but the reason, you laid out the reasons perfectly. You have to communicate what happened
2662720	2670080	as well as having it had it happen. Right so you already connected the dots but obviously
2670080	2676640	not only am I having to write and present my argument, I'm also having orders being issued to
2676640	2682800	me which are written. I'm sure you've heard the term rules of engagement, well rules of engagement
2682800	2692160	is a 12 page document that is in a bunch of legalese and I've got to translate that document
2692160	2698880	to my troops some of whom you know barely graduated high school and so I've got to be
2698880	2703760	able to do that so I've got to be able to read and then write and be able to then communicate
2703760	2709680	and talk to the team and brief them in a manner that they can actually understand what it is
2709680	2715920	I'm talking about and what it is our mission is and why we're doing this mission so that was why I
2716480	2723200	decided to study English when I went to college and so that was a conscious decision
2723680	2729360	absolutely and with that end in mind that it was so tell me exactly what the decision was
2730080	2736160	with regards to studying English what did you know that because it's not as you pointed out
2736160	2741200	it's not self-evidently the most practical of pursuits and not necessarily what you'd expect
2741200	2745760	someone with a military orientation to pursue right here's the here's the thought process
2746960	2754880	I want to be a good seal the good seals that I see can communicate they can write and they can read
2754880	2759600	that's what I need to learn how to do I need to learn how to do that better so that I can
2760240	2765360	persuade my chain of command that we need to do this mission or we need this piece of gear
2765360	2770960	or this guy over here needs to get an award or he needs to get promoted all those things
2770960	2776400	are done by being able to write and communicate properly okay so so let's say you take the example
2776400	2787200	of a seal who's got it all but this literacy okay so what what happens to him compared to someone
2787200	2796720	who has all those skills well if he can't if he can't write well and he's in charge of six guys
2796720	2802080	and one of those guys works hard or does something that deserves to be recognized
2802960	2808560	this is the responsibility of that leader to write that person an award okay so he can't reward his
2808560	2813360	he can't reward his his good workers his good soldiers he can give him a pat on the back but
2813360	2818320	a pat on the back isn't going to get him promoted an award is actually worth some points towards
2818320	2823760	your promotion and the people that are on that board that are giving that reward they're never
2823760	2828000	going to meet that leader and they're definitely not going to meet that guy there's no there's no
2828000	2832480	bias it's based on this piece of paper that you hand in you hand in this piece of paper they
2832480	2838000	read the piece of paper and they say award approved or award not approved or you want to do a mission
2838000	2842400	and you send that up the chain of command and it's the same thing it gets to a certain point
2842400	2847600	where they're just looking at it and reading and trying to decipher this pile of junk that you've
2847600	2853360	put together and by the way if I'm in charge and Jordan sends me a concept of operations
2853360	2858960	that doesn't make any sense why would I possibly let you go out and execute an operation that I
2858960	2866080	can't even understand what it is you're trying to do so it has a huge impact it has a huge impact
2866640	2870960	okay well I'm dwelling on this because it's it's upsetting to me I would say that
2872880	2881520	young people in particular aren't stringently instructed that the ability to that literacy
2881520	2887600	makes them powerful in every way they can possibly imagine except the absolutely immediate
2888640	2895440	and so it's just sad to me that it's not sold in that manner you want to be weak
2896400	2902240	stay illiterate you want to be strong it's like put yourself together physically fair enough man
2902240	2908320	get brave and street smart but then you could add some literacy to that and you're an unstoppable
2908320	2916240	machine so I concur 100% and you know you said being literate makes you powerful and
2917360	2922160	throughout recent history if we're trying to oppress someone what we don't want them to be
2922160	2928320	able to do is read or write or or articulate themselves right well we haven't even talked
2928320	2932880	about reading you know we just talked about writing and fair enough so but obviously you
2932880	2937920	studied English so you also read and so what's the advantage to that as far as you're concerned
2937920	2946160	practically speaking well obviously there are so many lessons that you can pull out of
2947360	2955120	books and you you can get to a point where nothing really surprises you because you've
2955120	2963040	at least seen some indication of what can unfold through reading so again for me it's
2963040	2970480	very much focused on combat and war but there's there's lessons that you learn and you say oh
2971200	2977040	I've seen that before there's a book it's it is a book called about face which I think the last
2977040	2985520	time you and I talked you were I think you were writing the forward for for the gulag and I was
2985520	2991120	about to write the forward to I don't know if that's your favorite book but I was lucky enough
2991200	2995040	to be able to write the forward for my favorite book which was re-released because I was talking
2995040	3001200	about it all the time and the book is called about the book is called about face and it's
3001200	3005200	about a guy that was in the Korean War and that he was in the Vietnam War and his name is Colonel
3005200	3012400	David Hackworth but I would read that book when I was on deployment I would read open up that book
3012400	3017120	anywhere and I would read two pages or three pages before I'd go to bed if I was in my bed that night
3017840	3022640	and there were so many lessons that correlated to what I was actually going through and a real
3022640	3028240	obvious example was when he was in Vietnam he's working with the South Vietnamese soldiers and
3028240	3032960	therefore by proxy the South Vietnamese government and guess what they're all corrupt and they're
3032960	3036720	not motivated and they don't have the right gear and here we are in Iraq and we're working with
3036720	3040720	Iraqi soldiers and therefore by proxy we're working with the Iraqi government guess what
3040720	3045440	they're all corrupted they're they're they're not well equipped and how do you how did he deal with
3045440	3051600	it how do we deal with it so there's an example of when you read you can learn and you don't have to
3052560	3057040	you don't have to go through the school of hard knocks you don't have to get punched in the face
3057040	3063200	repeatedly with things that turn out to be situations that other people have absolutely
3063200	3073120	gone through and the amount of the amount of the the the the level of capability increases
3073120	3080240	so much by seeing something one single time well if I see something one time I'm I'm infinitely
3080240	3086560	better than if I'd never seen it before so if it's like those those little puzzles they give
3086560	3091600	you a little puzzle some kind of a mind bender right the mind benders only work on you one time
3091600	3096400	the riddle only works on you one time then you I know the answer to that that's the answer you
3096400	3102560	know you never get fooled by that again so just knowing just seeing it one time you're
3102560	3107760	infinitely better so when you read enough you're capturing all these lessons and and you know what
3107760	3116800	it's I gotta say this it's not just reading it's not just reading and and I learned this
3117440	3122960	because as I started doing my podcast and many of my podcasts are just me reading books
3122960	3131840	I realized how to read more intently even more intently than I did when I was going to college
3131840	3136480	and I was going to be you know writing a paper about a book and so I'd read it in a certain way
3137040	3141840	but you even that reading was a little bit detached a little bit detached because you're
3141840	3146800	looking for a theme or you're looking for character development or what have you but
3146800	3154960	when you read to learn about human nature and life you you you detach less and you kind of
3154960	3162080	put yourself in there and you experience it a little bit closer and then when you take a step
3162080	3166160	back you go oh yeah I I know what he was thinking right there because I was right there with him
3167200	3174640	and so there's a certain attitude you kind of have to put yourself into the work and and really
3174720	3180240	read it with that kind of intensity if for lack of a better word is it is it possible for human
3180240	3187120	being to read intensely because that's what I try and do I get that's no different than than acting
3187120	3193200	intensely or playing intensely of course you want to put the book on you want to become that person
3193200	3197920	that can rattle you up man especially if the person is thinking all sorts of things that you've
3197920	3204000	never thought I mean I love reading for that reason I could pick my peers too which I really
3204000	3209280	loved it's like well you know I have these people around me but then there's these people who who've
3209280	3215120	lived before me and in different places and I can set them up on my shelf I can enter into their
3215120	3220960	world and I can benefit from everything they've thought and saturate myself with that person
3220960	3226160	it's and it's very disruptive especially if the person that you're reading has a mind that's more
3226160	3231040	powerful and more well developed than your own I mean Friedrich Nietzsche spun me around for
3231040	3238000	about three years and I was reading Jung at the same time intensely and the same thing you know it
3238000	3244960	was very disruptive but unbelievably useful unbelievably useful to try on other people
3244960	3251120	like that and you get the benefit of their entire life distilled into their into their book you
3251120	3256960	know it it's 30 years of work I read this one book called the Neuropsychology of Anxiety which
3256960	3261920	is a it's a great scientific work I think it's the greatest neuropsychological work
3261920	3268400	of the last 50 years it's very hard book I think it has 1800 references something like that and
3268400	3273920	this guy Jeffrey Gray he actually read all those references and he understood them and so it took
3273920	3280400	me six months to read the book but I got an entire education out of it I got to experience in six
3280400	3286400	months what it took him 30 years to learn like what a gift that is it's it's it's unbelievable
3286400	3293120	I was I was listening to an interview with Gary Kasparov I think you said Russian he was a chess
3293120	3300560	world champion for 20 years something like this and he they asked him anyway the the interviewer
3300560	3307920	didn't ask him directly if he could beat this young young guy named Magnus Carlson who's the
3307920	3313120	current kind of prodigy of chess he's just phenomenal and the highest chess rating ever
3313120	3319280	etc etc and he didn't get asked directly if he could beat him but it was definitely implied
3319280	3324560	if I remember the interview correctly and and it was very interesting to me Gary Kasparov
3324560	3330320	there was two things that I found interesting number one was he said he's younger than me
3330320	3335760	and he didn't mean that and like if that was an advantage for for Gary he meant it he's younger
3335760	3340640	than me so he has an advantage as an advantage because he's younger and I kind of thought to
3340640	3346160	myself well that's kind of weird because this isn't a physical this isn't a wrestling match this
3346160	3353120	isn't a jujitsu match why would that help and then sure enough you learn a little bit about
3353120	3359200	cognitive decline and Gary Kasparov is 57 years old when he did this interview and and guess what
3359200	3365360	you start well depending on who you are but you start to see cognitive cognitive decline
3365920	3372080	around that time and I'm sure it kicks in at 25 well there you go there's you can IQ is pretty
3372080	3379120	unitary but you can fracture it into crystallized and and fluid and fluid IQ is what enables you to
3379120	3386720	learn and it declines from 25 onward crystallized intelligence continues to grow roughly speaking
3386720	3392240	because it's partly dependent on such things as vocabulary which you can learn and which accumulate
3392240	3398000	but interestingly enough you know you were talking about physically the best way to stave off cognitive
3398000	3405280	decline is not cognitive activity it's exercise weightlifting and cardiovascular exercise can
3406080	3411200	is the it's by far the most potent means of staving off cognitive decline yeah so Kasparov
3411200	3416640	would have the advantage in terms of experience but the younger guy would have the edge on sheer raw
3416640	3423440	brain power that's what I thought too that's what I thought too but guess what it's wrong and it's
3423440	3432320	wrong for the exact reason that you just said so Magnus Carlson when he's 11 years old he gets to
3432320	3439680	open up a book and see every single match and move that Gary Kasparov ever made right that's what they
3439680	3445440	do they document that stuff of course and so what he got to do was what you got to do you got to
3445440	3452000	learn a person's 30 years experience in six months well this young kid so so this where it might have
3452000	3458560	taken Gary Kasparov you know eight years or four years to figure out how to get out of some particular
3459200	3464320	quandary on the chessboard well Magnus just opened to a page in a book and said oh that if I ever get
3464320	3470960	into that quandary I'm there and so what Magnus got to do is he got to start from here right and build
3471680	3476640	and so I make this point from a leadership perspective yeah we can do the same things
3476640	3482960	as as leaders we don't have to figure all this stuff out we can jump up to Gary Kasparov's level
3482960	3490720	or at least get a baseline of what he knew and and win because we learned very interesting to me
3490720	3496080	well you think and again with regards to selling this sort of thing you know I'm stunned that it's
3496080	3500400	possible to make history boring for example people should be so enthralled with history
3500400	3506080	that they can't get enough of it but with reading you imagine you have this opportunity to learn
3506080	3514160	whatever you want from the greatest people who ever lived along that dimension and and
3514160	3526720	well it's stunning to me that that is a hard sell it's mysterious that that it's
3527680	3532800	that that it isn't something that everyone is just clamoring for I mean that to me that points to a
3532800	3540080	devastating failure inadequacy of the education system a mysterious inadequacy yeah there's a
3540160	3547120	I think maybe the transaction isn't always clear for people I always talk about well if you're
3547120	3550720	going to sell somebody if you're going to sell somebody a book you know if I'm going to sell
3550720	3558400	you a book Jordan you've got to give me $20 and eight hours of your time right that that's what
3558400	3561520	you know you're going to give me you're going to give me $20 and you're going to give me
3561520	3566480	eight hours of time which you would probably you know have other things that you might need to do
3566560	3570720	and the transaction is not always clear of what you're going to get out of that especially when
3570720	3574880	look you can spend a lot of time reading books and not get as much as you might want you might not
3574880	3579920	get your $20 worth out of a book so you have to be somewhat selective now luckily it's not even that
3579920	3585440	hard to figure out which books to read because there's so many reviews and and and history about
3585440	3589920	where these books came from and the and the productivity that they resulted in so but I
3589920	3596640	think it's hard sometimes for look I can I can only speak for myself when I was younger
3597760	3602800	it was really hard for me to figure out that transaction yeah fair enough like I had a librarian
3603520	3612000	when I was 13 who told me what to read which is what a teacher should do right there's nothing a
3612000	3616720	teacher can do for you that's better than say well here's 10 books that will change you completely
3616720	3622000	and who actually knows that to be the case one of the things I'd really like to do I I've toyed with
3624400	3628400	well with the whole concept of online education one thing I'd really like to do is to
3629280	3635680	divide up the variety of domains of learning and identify the top 10 books in each domain
3636240	3639440	so to ask an expert it's like well you're a historian you're a great historian
3640000	3645520	what 10 books are crucial and I have a list on my website a list of recommended books there's
3645520	3650640	about 100 of them that have been instrumental for me and lots of people have used that list to
3650640	3657440	purchase books so that's been really good but I'd really like to extend extend and expand it yeah I
3657440	3664080	have the same thing on my website the books from the podcast and same thing all kinds of those books
3664080	3669840	get sold and it's it's beautiful to see but the people that are checking the website or listening
3669840	3674240	to the podcast they know that those books have been through a filter they're there for a reason
3674240	3679440	they're there because they're going to be worth that transaction and I think that's a tough sell for
3680320	3684080	for a lot of people they can't figure out maybe they've invested in books before and they didn't
3684080	3688880	quite get the return on investment that they wanted and buy two or three books and 50 or 60
3688880	3694560	dollars and 20 or 30 hours yeah that's that's a great observation I think because one of the
3694560	3701120	advantages to coming from a literate background is that you do in fact reduce the transaction costs
3701120	3705760	because there's an infinite number of books I mean well no there isn't but as far as we're
3705760	3710480	concerned there might as well be and so the question of what to read really is daunting if you don't
3710480	3718320	know anyone who reads like where do I start and and and how can I not be a fool in doing this so
3720720	3725680	well okay back to English so what what were you reading when you were in university was it was
3725760	3729680	it fiction novels was it nonfiction what what were you what were you focusing on
3731360	3738080	it was like your basic English literature that's what I studied and so I read everything I read
3738080	3742400	everything you know from each one of the little periods and it took the various classes and and
3742400	3750560	really as trite as this may sound it was actually the the most impact was from Shakespeare there's
3750560	3757360	the most impact on on multiple levels and I'll tell you the primary level and when I've covered
3757360	3762800	Shakespeare on my podcast I explain this to people people think well you know I didn't really
3762800	3768160	understand I read it and understand it and I so I start off when I talk about Shakespeare on my
3768160	3775200	podcast I start off by saying listen if you think you're gonna just pick up Shakespeare open it up
3775200	3782480	and read it and understand it you're not going to because it's barely written in English it's
3782480	3786880	barely written in English it's almost another language and so you're not going to be able to
3786880	3793360	just pick it up and read through it it's it's it's written in an almost other language so what you
3793360	3797600	have to do is you have to start to interpret it and so what I realized with with Shakespeare is
3797600	3805520	number one the weight of the words that these words were so pregnant with meaning that you had to
3806080	3812000	pull those words and parse those words and pull those words apart to see all the depth that each
3812000	3817680	individual word had and then the way that they're put together and what was great about this was
3817680	3822000	by the time I was back because then I went right back into the SEAL teams and somebody would hand
3822000	3826640	me a rules of engagement document and that was written by some lawyer in Washington DC and I'd
3826640	3829680	pull it out and say wait a second this word I don't know what this word means let's pull this
3829680	3833360	word out let's see what this let's see what this actual definition of this particular word is and
3833360	3837360	how that changes my viewpoint of these rules of engagement and how can I translate that for my
3837360	3845120	troops so that they actually know what to do so that part for me was from a reading perspective
3845120	3850160	starting to read Shakespeare and and saying oh okay you're not gonna understand this and if you
3850160	3856320	don't understand something that's okay you pull out the Oxford English dictionary and you look it up
3856320	3860880	and then you not just find out what the meaning of the word is but what's the root word and where
3860880	3864800	does it come from and what kind of depth and what kind of yeah that's really that's that's
3864800	3870320	unbelievably useful too to discover the connotation of words and the Oxford English dictionary is
3870320	3876560	particularly good for that because you you discover things that you'd never guess by looking at how
3876560	3882160	the word developed I mentioned the word hamartia like the fact that the word for sin was derived
3882160	3889440	from an archery concept was revelatory to me it's like that's so cool it ties this moral concept
3889440	3896880	abstract philosophy back down to something as as primordial as weaponry and hunting and just the
3896880	3901680	fact that that's the metaphor is absolutely fascinating and and then there's the overlap
3901680	3906480	in meaning that I already referred to and virtually every word is like that because word is an
3906480	3911920	ancient artifact it's like it's like an it's like an animal in some sense it has an evolutionary
3911920	3917520	history and it transforms across time and each word kind of it carries the echoes of its past
3917520	3924720	with it too because each word um attracts other words in a particular unique way so it kind of
3924720	3930960	lives in a word ecosystem as well and the ecosystem contain information about the history of that word
3931040	3937120	and you think well why is that important it's like well hey guess what you think in words you
3937120	3944800	talk in words you have all these archaic uh what are what these archaic entities these words these
3944800	3949360	living entities that you use it's like the more you know about them the more you know about you
3949360	3954080	the more you know about other people and the better you are at formulating and communicating
3954080	3959760	your ideas there's nothing there's nothing lost in that kind of investigation nothing there's
3959760	3965600	nothing but gain there so yeah and that's that was so that was the uh that was the English
3965600	3971600	road for me and and it was good thing I asked you that question hey yeah I'm really really
3971600	3978480	insightful for you to come up with that thank you thank you all right so so and you did you
3978480	3985520	did you enjoy university did you find a community there no okay so when I was going to university
3985520	3991360	I was married I I had two kids when I got to university I had three kids when I left I was
3991360	3999680	not a university student I was in fact in fact I would sit in the front row during my classes I
3999680	4006240	would have three pencils and three pens lined up and staged on my desk I would be ready to take
4006240	4010000	notes when the when if the teacher said something I didn't understand I'd be sitting in the front
4010000	4014000	row raised my hand I don't understand what you just said can you explain that and I mean you
4014000	4019440	know I'm 28 years old and there's a bunch of 18 years old in there and they just want to you know
4019440	4026080	go out and hang out with their friends and I'm there I'm in there to I'd love to really sound
4026080	4029760	come off sounding good and tell you that I was there to learn but I was there to get A's which
4029760	4036320	meant I did have to learn so I went at it as a competition and I was competing not with the other
4036320	4040640	students I was competing with the teachers because I'm a little bit crazy sometimes I would want to
4040640	4044800	make sure that they couldn't ask me a question on their test that I didn't know the answer to
4045600	4052000	so that's what I did and so did I have fun maybe not and one thing I when I got back to the seal
4052000	4058800	teams what I told the guys I'd say you know what I learned in college and they'd say what and I said
4058800	4065520	I learned never ever ever ever get out of the teams ever never get out of sorry get out of never
4065520	4071120	get out of the teams the seal teams never get out of the team okay okay well you know I taught
4072320	4080400	older students in Boston and undergraduates and the the undergraduates especially in Boston but
4080400	4086320	also at the University of Toronto were very very bright and generally very hard working the older
4086320	4094560	students were generally not as highly selected but man they were committed and most of them had had
4094560	4101120	jobs that they weren't thrilled with let's say and had a hunger for what education could bring
4101120	4106160	them that the younger people lacked and so it does seem to me often and maybe this is just because
4106160	4112640	I'm getting older that after high school it might be good for people who want to pursue university
4112640	4119120	to go do something that they're qualified for which isn't much at that point for a year or two
4119120	4124400	so that when they do go to college or university they understand just exactly what they're being
4124400	4133280	offered yeah but I couldn't agree more working in the regular world will definitely make you
4133280	4139040	appreciate the opportunities that you may have if you go and learn more in the world
4140880	4147760	all right so you you came out of university you had three kids you were married what happens next
4148480	4156320	go back to the SEAL teams and go through the rest of my career I showed up at a SEAL team
4156320	4161600	September 11th had happened so I show up at a SEAL team I become a platoon commander at a SEAL
4161600	4168000	team and then go on deployment I get done with that deployment that deployment was primarily to
4168000	4172640	Baghdad although we worked kind of all over Iraq got done with that deployment I went and became
4173360	4178960	the aid to camp for the admiral that was in charge of all the SEALs at that point in time
4178960	4185280	and so that was sort of an well not even sort of it was a very administrative job but it was also
4185280	4193440	a huge opportunity for me to get to see the SEAL community in the most broad way that I could
4194080	4200720	so I got to learn a lot there and then I went back to a SEAL team and was now what's called the
4200720	4207360	task unit commander which is two SEAL platoons combined together and I was in charge of two
4207360	4211440	SEAL platoons combined together which is called the task unit my task unit was called task unit
4211440	4219360	bruiser and we deployed to Ramadi Iraq and that was in the summer of 2006 very tough fighting
4220400	4225840	very tough battle and came home from that deployment hey so could I let me let me ask you
4225840	4233040	there so can you tell me can you describe a typical day or a typical week like what was it
4233040	4238480	like to be there I'd like all the details what you get tell me what happens when you get up in
4238480	4246640	the morning what did your day look like so we're there we showed up there and as soon as we got
4246640	4253760	there and we knew going into it in 2005 2006 if you can remember watching the news in 2005 2006
4254400	4258560	just about every day you would see in the news that there was
4260480	4266960	three soldiers killed in al-Ambar province or five marines killed in al-Ambar province or three
4266960	4272480	marines wounded in al-Ambar province and the capital of al-Ambar province is the city of Ramadi
4272480	4278320	and the vast majority of those casualties were happening inside the city of Ramadi and we knew
4278320	4283920	that going there and when you say we you say we were deployed there who are you you're obviously
4283920	4289280	referring to the country to your country but who what does we mean when you make when you say that
4289280	4294640	but when I say we in this particular case I'm talking about my seal task unit so I had and
4294640	4302240	that's how many how many people yeah so I had about 35 to 40 seals most of the time and then
4302240	4312480	another 60 around 60 support personnel and these people are armorers that you know can fix our
4312480	4317680	weapons and and mechanics that can fix our humvees and intelligence people that gather information
4317680	4323120	for us and radio operators that can receive our radio calls so there's a big support network that
4323120	4329920	goes with the the seal task unit as we deployed and why was it a seal enterprise what what was
4329920	4335920	specific about this deployment that that required this the whatever it is that the seals bring and
4335920	4341600	what is it exactly that the seals bring that's specific so on this particular deployment at this
4341600	4348000	at this point in time seals were deploying to iraq all the time we were there was always seals
4348000	4354240	in iraq my first deployment was in 2003 2004 and we were in the beginning of that deployment we were
4354240	4360480	the only seal platoon there and then by this time there would be many more seals I forget what the
4360480	4367200	number is but so we were in iraq and we were conducting special operations missions and
4368640	4376640	in particular in romadi when we got there so us standard seal operation on my first deployment
4376640	4385680	was get gather intelligence from various sources so so through various sources we would gather
4385680	4392640	intelligence about the location of a bad guy okay so you had you had a variety of people who were
4392640	4400080	targets identified and they were leaders of of what made what marked them out as bad
4400800	4405040	what were their characteristics these are these are people well we want to talk about
4405040	4409040	their psychological character no no no I mean you might be able to do a better job than that
4409040	4414160	I can tell you what they were doing for a living was trying to kill americans trying to kill coalition
4414160	4419120	forces trying to kill other iraqis trying to create chaos and mayhem for the interim government in
4419120	4424560	iraq these are and were they generally leaders of leaders of a group that you would target or
4424560	4430480	the are these people who were involved in the army on the other side or like put them in context
4430480	4435680	yeah so there's no there's no I mean the iraqi army is actually on our side right so these the
4435680	4441760	iraqi army is our friends and that's who we're working alongside and now early in the war not
4441760	4450320	so much because the the coalition forces made a decision to disband the entire iraqi military
4450320	4455200	right right well this is why I wondered if there were people with on the military to what degree
4455200	4460800	there were people with military chanting that were facing you yes so since that happened a lot
4461440	4466000	and as a matter of fact in in the city of ramadi there were there used to be a massive
4466720	4471360	military iraqi military base there and so a bunch of former iraqi military lived there
4471360	4475440	there was a whole area that was called the it was there was an area called the
4476320	4480240	officer housing there was an area in ramadi that was called the officer housing where iraqi
4480240	4486560	officers used to live so and I'm not nailing that name but it's something like that um so yes there
4486560	4494000	was there was former iraqi regime army people that were out there fighting there was also foreign
4494000	4498160	fighters and so would they have their own little groups their bands of people that were fighting
4498160	4503600	with them you were and you were targeting leaders I'm just wondering how people were selected so
4503760	4510160	the the seals were after specific individuals generally speaking yes and here's what we figured
4510160	4517200	out if you only target the leaders well it's going to be a lot harder to catch them because
4517200	4524480	they're laying low and they're moving around and and they try and they try and give misinformation
4524480	4529040	about where they are and whatnot so what we'd go and go out and grab you know one of their
4529040	4532960	lieutenants grab one of their soldiers and find out where the lieutenant is grab the lieutenant
4532960	4538880	find out where the leader is so we there would be these cell networks these little these little
4538880	4543760	networks and maybe they're a mortar cell and they're they're dropping mortars they're a roadside bomb
4543760	4548080	cell and that's what they're doing and so we would figure out who these bad guys were and then
4548080	4555120	through these various intelligence sources we would find out a location maybe it was a mid-level
4555120	4560000	guy maybe it was a high level guy maybe it was a low level guy and then once we know their location
4560480	4567120	we're going to get them so what what were the typical motivations of the people that you were
4567120	4573520	pursuing what what were they fighting for so there's a variety of motivation yeah some of the
4574160	4578480	you know if you're a front line guess what if you're a 15 year old kid with no money
4579040	4586880	guess what's a good motivator money and you and these the insurgents to be yep the insurgents
4586880	4593360	say hey we'll give you 100 bucks to go launch an rpg at the american base so that's their motivation
4593360	4599120	end of story the higher you get up the chain of command the the more you're going to start
4599120	4605360	leaning towards legitimate jihadists that now there's jihadists throughout the chain of command
4605360	4610560	don't get me wrong and and i mean hardcore jihadists and and i remember the first time i
4610640	4618240	was in my first deployment the first time i saw a legit hardcore jihadist you can tell
4619040	4625360	that these this guy hated us and it was very clear from the look on his face when we captured him
4625920	4631920	it was completely he was filled with seething hatred so there's jihadists throughout the
4631920	4636240	chain of command and that guy was like i'm so so so the the jihadist motivation was
4637120	4641760	well by definition in some sense a religious motivation but your experience of it was that
4641760	4647280	it was primarily a visceral hate and hatred for what do you think i mean obviously you're an
4647280	4655200	occupying force let's say and you know and and america is seen at at least among the jihadists
4655200	4663280	of that time as as a truly satanic force i suppose i mean what's motivating what was your experience
4663280	4668320	of what was motivating the hatred yes it's everything you just said but i mean you can
4668320	4674320	trace it all the way back to the israeli palestinian conflict i mean you can they're they're gonna
4674320	4683200	draw and see view view the west as evil as the great satan and and so that's what what did you
4683200	4689760	think at that point about the morality of the endeavor i mean because this is why i'm curious
4689840	4694800	like and please do correct me i'm sure i'm wrong about many of the things that i think but
4696000	4702640	it seems to me that the clearer your moral sense when you're engaged in a battle the more likely
4702640	4708000	you are all things considered to win because you're not part of you isn't going to be fighting
4708000	4713520	against you right and i mean in any enterprises like that if i you know i find that if i'm involved
4713520	4721120	in a prod project and i have reservations then the part of me that has reservations 20 percent of me
4721120	4726560	pushes against the other 80 percent and then i'm only 60 percent as effective as i might be
4726560	4732400	and so whenever i engage in an enterprise i try to walk through it ethically and see well am i
4732400	4738560	actually committed to this what qualms do i have what what doubts do i have what resistances do i have
4738560	4744160	because that's going to make me weak and so when you go into battle i presume it's the same thing
4744160	4749760	that you have to believe i know they say that soldiers also fight very hard for the guy who's
4749760	4755360	in the foxhole next to them so there's that brotherhood camaraderie but you go there as
4755360	4760640	a representative of your country as well your nation and and there is that there has to be
4760720	4764880	that ethical dimension to it and so what how did you guys deal with that
4768480	4774640	looking at what we're doing and and what's what's really interesting is even though when you stare
4774640	4782800	at it from a strategic perspective when you say oh as a western power as this country we're going
4782800	4789680	in here and we could argue all day long about whether that's a right call or a wrong call
4789680	4794320	whether that's morally correct or whether it's an immoral move we could have arguments about
4794320	4799680	that all day yes well they've been going on for 3000 years in the middle east right right endless
4799680	4809840	arguments about what's right and and here's what here's what one of the nice benefits of being on
4809840	4818240	the ground is you get to see what's happening what's actually happening so what you see in
4818320	4824080	iraq when you're actually on the ground is for instance in ramadi what you see and what we saw
4824880	4833760	is the iraqi populace who are a bunch of normal people that want to carry out their lives and
4833760	4840000	raise their kids and run whatever business they're going to run that's what they want to do they want
4840000	4846720	to they want they actually want life liberty and the pursuit of happiness is what they want
4846720	4851120	that's a normal iraqi family when we would when we would go to an iraqi family's house that's
4851120	4859600	pretty much what you're dealing with and amongst those normal people that just want to live their
4859600	4868960	lives in peace there are insurgents and the insurgents want power they want control and
4868960	4881040	they are willing to do anything to get it and so when you see fathers beheaded and their heads
4881040	4891520	left in the yard of a family because he had you know had really he was he was working with a shake
4891520	4898240	that had said things against al-qaeda and now this guy is beheaded uh we there was a guy that
4898240	4906720	was skinned alive there was torture there was rape so when you are on the ground and you see
4906720	4914960	this stuff happening and you see the local populace clapping and cheering when you kill insurgents
4917520	4925680	your strategic vision isn't quite in focus as much as what you're seeing right in front of you
4925680	4934160	with your own two eyes and so therefore the 20 of you that might be arguing whether this is right
4934160	4944800	or wrong when you see families slaughtered you you very quickly tell that 20 of your brain
4944800	4950960	that you don't you need to look at what's happening right here this is this this is this is immoral
4950960	4958480	and we need to do what we can to help these people and do you did you feel then and and then again
4959440	4968000	now i mean it's a quagmire it's an ethical quagmire the middle east and so it seems in some sense
4968000	4975600	that no matter what you do there it's wrong and and i'm not trying to convince you of that believe
4975680	4981440	me i'm i'm really curious about this you felt when you were there that you were on the side
4981440	4990880	that was doing the right things do you um and now when you look back i mean i don't know what to make
4990880	4995680	of what what happened with the us in the middle east over the last 15 years i'm just as happy and
4995680	5002080	perhaps you are as well there's less engagement in foreign wars now than there was 10 years ago in
5002080	5007920	the us right that seems to have receded to some degree and that perhaps that's a good thing
5009840	5016000	what do you think about the about about america's involvement in iraq what what conclusions have
5016000	5023040	you come to so you talked about this argument that you're going to have in your own head
5024400	5031280	well you are also going to have that argument on a national level right you're going to have
5031280	5037600	a national level argument of whether this is the right thing or the wrong thing to do so my
5039760	5049040	scale my measure of this is if you are going to go to war if you are going to go to war
5050000	5061680	you have to make sure before you go that you have the proper will the proper will and there's
5061680	5067840	two types of will that you need to have if you're going to go to war the first type of will that you
5067840	5072480	need to have if you're going to go to war is you have to have the will to kill
5073200	5080720	you have to have the will to kill and guess what i am sorry to inform everybody it is not just the
5080720	5091200	will to kill the enemy because when you go to war war is an imperfect is an imperfect endeavor
5092160	5098880	and no matter how hard you try to just kill the the enemy you will kill civilians you will kill
5099600	5106800	women you will kill children that is what is going to happen that is what is going to happen
5106800	5114880	if you go to war so you have to make sure you have the will to do that that sometimes you're
5114880	5120320	going to drop a bomb and it's going to land and it's going to kill women and children that's what's
5120320	5126240	going to happen and anybody that thinks anything different is naive and ignorant
5126880	5132080	and we seem to let our politicians often convince us that that's possible but it's not
5133920	5141040	so you have to have the will to kill and then on top of that obviously you have to have the will
5141760	5149360	to die you have to have you have to know and understand that if you embark in a war
5149600	5160400	your sons and daughters are going to be killed that is what is going to happen and anybody that says
5160400	5168800	it's not going to happen is naive and ignorant now i think before we go to war oftentimes we
5168800	5175040	rationalize that we can mitigate the risk of killing we can mitigate the risk of dying
5175040	5180160	and for some reason we think we can mitigate those risks down to zero which is impossible
5182000	5190880	so if you have the will if you look at a situation and say we need to do something here
5191600	5198960	for moral reasons for national security reasons we need to take action okay so let me ask you a
5198960	5206800	question there if you don't mind um you know whenever i have had to take difficult action in
5206800	5217600	the past so take to take a risk my justification for that so what allowed me to organize my will
5217600	5226000	let's say was a belief that inaction was a worse crime so
5229520	5237120	i'm trying to think through what it takes to conjure up the will that you just described
5237760	5243280	morally speaking and it's very difficult to talk about the morality of war but it's absolutely
5243280	5250640	necessary clearly do you believe that in the situation in iraq do you think that
5251200	5256480	the argument was laid forth it's it's it's such a it's it's
5260160	5266160	so there was a terrible attack on new york 9 11 and the response was
5267120	5276560	focused on iraq that's correct so far yes i'm afghanistan immediately and yes
5276560	5282960	thereafter focused on iraq yes all right it was never obvious to me why the focus shifted to iraq
5284800	5291040	do you do you have any sense of why that was i know that there was a lot of thought at the highest
5291040	5297840	levels of the american government prior to 9 11 about iraq and so there was a plan that was already
5297840	5305760	in some sense in place for iraq but it isn't obvious to me why attention was shifted towards iraq
5305760	5314640	in the aftermath apart from the fact that that plan already existed i think the shift came
5315520	5322880	from i'm trying to think of some kind of a metaphor here but you know you've got you've
5322880	5331600	got some rats in you know in the garage and the rats have nod through some of the wiring
5331600	5338560	and so you go and you you know you try and kill the rats in the garage and you realize you know
5338560	5343920	what this isn't the only place that these rats seem could could be there could also be some
5343920	5351040	rats over here in the basement and we have wires over there too we better go handle that situation
5351040	5357120	as well you said that you were overwhelmed by the reality of the situation on the ground
5357120	5362400	my first deployment to iraq we we worked with we we just worked with seals basically all the
5362400	5368080	operations we did was just with seals when we went back to iraq and ramadi we were ordered
5369040	5374480	to work with iraqi soldiers now the iraqi soldiers were poorly trained they were poorly
5374480	5379920	equipped they had low motivation some of them were not very trustworthy and we were going out
5379920	5387520	into the worst battlefield on planet earth at the time and it was it was pretty hard to make sense
5387520	5394960	of that order right mm-hmm but when i thought through the order you know why why is why is
5395040	5399360	why is my senior leadership ordering me to do this well the answer is quite clear
5400400	5404480	after i thought about it a little bit hey the reason that we have to do this is because
5405200	5410320	we need to work with the iraqi soldiers so that the iraqi soldiers become proficient enough
5410320	5416400	that they can handle the security in their own country of course yes okay so my my my
5417440	5421680	my senior leadership isn't telling me to do something because they want me to die
5421760	5425520	or want my troops to get wounded and killed they're telling me to do something because
5425520	5432000	it's a strategic move where in hopefully two or three years the iraqi military will be
5432640	5438080	at a level where they can handle security in their own country okay got it okay that's part one
5439360	5446400	well when when we got ordered to work with iraqi soldiers it wasn't just it wasn't just
5447040	5452320	my seal tasking it was everyone all coalition forces all american army and marine corps
5452320	5457040	was getting told you'll work with iraqi forces and everyone kind of had that nervous feeling
5457040	5461680	right hold on a second you want me to have this person that has a rusty ak-47 and a pair
5461680	5465520	of sandals you want that person to to support me out on the battlefield that doesn't make
5465520	5471280	any sense and so what the american forces did was when they were ordered to take iraqi soldiers
5471280	5478560	with them on an operation and they would go out with a platoon of 40 americans and they would take
5478560	5485520	two iraqis with them because they were told to take iraqis plural so that means two that's what
5485520	5489760	we're gonna do and they leave them in the hun v and they go conduct their operations well senior
5489760	5495680	leadership got wind of this and this obviously is not in the spirit of what we're being told to do
5496400	5501440	you're not going to get a nation's army trained up by taking two soldiers out so the next thing
5502160	5511360	the leadership said was okay here's the new order for every one american that you bring out
5511360	5518400	you have to have seven iraqi soldiers with you so yeah that's different so they imposed a ratio on
5518400	5525360	us now ramadi at this time was a complete war zone other parts of iraq were actually somewhat
5525360	5532560	pacified and in many of those pacified areas that order actually made sense the the the iraqis in
5532560	5538320	some area the iraqi soldiers in some areas were actually capable of conducting decent operations
5538320	5545120	with very little american oversight and the level of violence in those areas wasn't that bad so it
5545120	5553280	was okay well in ramadi it didn't make any sense whatsoever so i'm being ordered to take one seal
5553280	5557760	for every seven iraqi soldiers well first of all because of the fighting was so bad in ramadi
5557760	5568160	many of the iraqi units only had 10 or 15 or 20 people in their platoon so if i was going to send
5568160	5575360	out seals i would only be able to send out two seals 15 iraqi soldiers so now which two seals
5575360	5581120	am i going to send am i going to send the medic well i want to send a medic for sure but guess
5581120	5584800	what i also need to send a machine gunner in case we get into a firefight well what about the
5584800	5589120	radio man that actually calls for help what about the point man that actually knows where we're going
5589120	5593680	what about the leader who's going to make decisions out there what about the explosive ordinance
5593680	5599840	disposal guy that can dismantle bombs from going off so who am i supposed to leave behind
5601280	5607760	it doesn't make any sense the the danger to the troops is so much higher in that situation
5607760	5613840	so what did i do did i say that's what i'm being ordered to do no i took all this into
5613840	5620320	consideration and i and i you'll appreciate this i wrote a point paper up my chain of command
5620320	5624560	explain the situation of what was happening explain the number of casualties explain the
5624560	5628960	level of violence explain the size of the iraqi elements that we were working with and said can
5628960	5634160	i please get a waiver for this and allow me to take however many seals i've deemed necessary to
5634160	5638320	take to be safe and my chain of command read it and said yeah sure jockel do whatever you want to do
5638320	5644640	thank you so that's okay so what what you what you're what you're telling me is that you take
5644640	5650560	what you're told to do and you take what you know to be the case on the ground and you try to do
5650560	5655600	do try to take both of them into account as much as possible while you're also shunting information
5655600	5660560	back up the hierarchy hopefully to modify their decisions the decisions they're making that aren't
5660560	5665040	in accordance with the reality on the ground right right so you do i mean you do your best
5665040	5669920	under the circumstance but that that makes that that that seems to be that's that seems to be a
5669920	5676640	good answer but but it escalates obviously it can escalate higher than that right it can
5676640	5683280	the decisions the orders that we're being given can escalate to a point where maybe this entire
5683280	5689200	thing that we're doing i think is wrong right right okay so now we get into a situation where
5690160	5695120	and the reason that i i have to explain all these other things is because it happens very rarely
5695840	5700320	it happens very rarely that you know someone in the military is looking at a decision that's
5700320	5705520	being made up on a big scale and says i think this is totally and completely wrong now i will tell you
5705520	5708880	and i wrote about this in my last leadership book leadership strategy and tactics
5711200	5714640	if you're being told to do something that you
5715040	5721280	believe is completely wrong well i would love to tell you that that's a black and white decision
5721280	5726320	but guess what it's not even that's not a black and white decision because jordan if you order me
5727360	5732240	to go and assault a machine gun nest that's that's on a hill with my squad
5733200	5738000	and i know that this is a machine gun nest in a bunkered position in an elevated position
5738000	5742000	with interlocking fields of fire and if we go up that hill we're all gonna die
5742960	5746960	and i look at you and say hey hey boss i don't think that's a good call they're
5746960	5751280	elevated they're bunkered they're interlocking this doesn't make any sense and you go no jocco
5751280	5755040	shut up and do it i said no i'm telling you jordan this isn't a good idea and you say no
5755040	5762560	shut up and do it now here's my decision point if i say you know what i will not do it i will not do
5762560	5768160	it you know what you do you go cool jocco you're fired and you get your yes man come over and your
5768160	5771520	yes man comes in you say go assault that machine gun nest and he takes the squad up and he gets
5771520	5780800	everybody killed so i surrendered my influence when i when i drew that line in the sand and said no
5780800	5786000	and you doomed other people to death and i doomed other people to death now my boss orders me you
5786000	5790960	order me and i say okay boss got it you you you definitely want me to do this there's no way out
5790960	5795200	yes you definitely got to do it okay all right guys here's what's happening we're gonna start
5795200	5798080	we're gonna get into a covered position we're gonna start maneuvering towards this thing
5798720	5803520	we're gonna see what kind of fire we receive if we start receiving overwhelming fire
5804400	5809600	i'm gonna lock some of you guys in that position and i'm gonna send another squad over to the flank
5809600	5812960	and we're gonna we're gonna take out this machine gun from nest from another angle or
5812960	5817840	i'm gonna hunker down in that position and we're gonna call for air support so i go you're decomposing
5817840	5821920	you're actually decomposing the process then into micro elements and then testing the micro
5821920	5827600	elements then you can report back with that information yes right right very smart very
5828240	5833760	we have to be very careful so when you talk about oh i don't think we should go into iraq
5834960	5838000	i don't think we should go okay so what am i gonna do hey i don't think we should go now
5838000	5842960	are there times where that might be the right decision there are some times like that where
5843520	5850880	maybe i think that me as a senior leader standing up and saying no to my boss is gonna make you
5850880	5854400	know jordan suddenly looks at me goes wait a second jocco's always been a good guy and now
5854400	5858400	we're sitting here telling me no he's really serious about maybe i maybe i'm not seeing something
5858400	5865200	maybe i can get you to rethink your position that's a risky move though it's always a risky
5865200	5870800	move to kind of draw a line in the sand yeah kind of an ultimatum because if you use up your capital
5870800	5874960	you burn your leadership capital it's even worse than that you just completely surrender your
5874960	5879440	leadership guy you don't even use it you you you obliterated it's gone you have no more influence
5879440	5888160	you're done so we have to think very long and hard about those things and so when it if i was
5888160	5893680	i was never put in a position like where i didn't where where i thought that what we were doing as
5893680	5900000	a country was wrong i'll tell you actually probably the closest i've come to that was i think it was
5900000	5910960	1993 the the massacre was unfolding in rwanda there was the the um the uh who twos were killing
5910960	5919760	the tutsis by the hundreds of thousands and i was on a navy ship um off the coast of off the
5919760	5928800	coast of africa on standby to go into rwanda as this slaughter took place took place and
5931200	5938400	we didn't do anything we didn't do anything so that's the cost of not going to war there
5938400	5942000	it's the cost of not going to war and and there's a very you know it's a very interesting i'm sure
5942000	5948480	you've heard of the the the massacre that took took place in me line vietnam and and one of the most
5949280	5954880	interesting things in that reprehensible scenario is
5957200	5964240	what stopped it what's so this is this this this horror is unfolding there's there's murder
5964240	5974560	mutilation rape just going berserk a company of american soldiers is murdering raping mutilating
5974560	5983360	bodies just absolutely heinous absolutely reprehensible and while this is happening a
5983360	5990560	helicopter pilot comes in and sees what's going on and these guys have lost their mind really
5990560	5994880	the guys on the ground have lost their mind the helicopter pilot flies back to base he walks into
5994880	5999200	the tactical operation center and says hey they are killing civilians out there the commanding
5999200	6003520	officer gets on the phone and says hey stop killing people and they stopped immediately
6005120	6009600	they stopped immediately that's that's what tells you how important leadership is
6010880	6014320	leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield and if you have a leader that's going
6014320	6018560	to let things start to go in this direction all it takes is one person to step up and say hey everyone
6018560	6026480	stop what you're doing this is wrong so you get a situation like rwanda we didn't really do anything
6026640	6034880	we we didn't do anything and what would it have taken if if we rolled in there and said hey no
6034880	6041920	more stop do they look around with their machetes covered in blood and wake up of their neighbors
6042560	6050720	and say oh wait a second yep okay we're gonna stop so i'm not saying these are easy predicaments
6051680	6058320	but certainly you know the idea of are there situations where it's better to do something
6058320	6062640	than nothing i'll tell you what rolling into Baghdad and going into Saddam Hussein's torture
6062640	6073280	chambers which we did and you see the the the uh the the hook there was hooks like hooks hanging
6073280	6081040	from ceilings and and drainage where blood would drain in these torture chambers you see that a
6081040	6089360	couple times and you think i'm okay with us being in here and getting rid of this guy
6093680	6099600	i'm gonna switch topics i want to talk to you about your books and i'd like to know look you
6099600	6104480	said right at the beginning of this interview that you wanted to be the best navy seal good navy
6104480	6108560	seal that's what you said you didn't say the best you want to be a good navy the best was aiming a
6108560	6114320	little bit too high yeah i know that's why i wanted i wanted to get the words right um what are you
6114320	6123520	doing now but you i mean i i presume that that your life is still being lived in an expansion
6123520	6129840	of that the pursuit of that initial ideal you've transformed multiple times you're a civilian you
6129840	6134960	you're you're a communicator mass communicator in a variety of different in a variety of different
6134960	6139040	ways i think you mentioned we were talking offline a little bit for example that you have a clothing
6139040	6144640	line and i'm going to ask you about that because that's that's that's a curious thing to me um
6145280	6152400	and that is i'm definitely curious about that but like what's your mission and is that the right
6152400	6162800	question is that an appropriate question so there's a there's there's a there's a there's a quality
6162800	6171680	let's call it so as i as i went through that that as i created in my mind that ideal of of what a
6171680	6177440	good seal is what is a good seal and and i'm sure you could i could say okay what do you think
6177440	6181760	jordan oh he's probably strong and he's probably fast and he's probably smart and he's probably
6181760	6185680	tactically sound and he can probably shoot a weapon straight and all those things absolutely all
6185680	6195280	those things are there and as you would kind of burn away the the or if you were to set up a hierarchy
6195280	6202160	of importance of what makes a good seal yeah you might think that some people would think oh well
6202160	6207040	it's probably being the best shot or it's probably being the strongest or it's probably being really
6207040	6211760	good in the water all those things all those skills that you think it might be and you could
6211760	6216160	talk to different seals and they would all kind of you know some guy would say it's running some
6216160	6220080	guys say it's strong some guy would say it's a best shot whatever best tactician
6222160	6224240	but if you offered them one thing
6227120	6233440	99.9 percent of seals would agree on what makes you a good seal
6237360	6241280	and that is you look out for your teammates
6244080	6250880	you put your team above yourself yeah so that's a real inversion of the things that you just
6250880	6256800	described a because all of those things are dimensions along which you could be excellent
6256800	6263120	in a manner that distinguishes you from the group and elevates you above them but you derive from
6263120	6271440	that acclaim that that should all be subordinate to a reciprocity and any seal that's a good seal
6272160	6276720	would tell you that that would be at the top of the hierarchy you can be the best shot yeah
6276720	6280080	you can be the best shot you can be the best diver you can be the strongest you can be the
6280080	6284880	fastest you can be the best tactician if you don't take care of your teammates
6286720	6290480	none of that none of those other things matter you you're not even wanted in the seal teams
6291440	6297360	that's that's that's what it is so well do you think that that seems to me to be true for
6298240	6303600	functional organizations in general is that and and certainly the people I've seen this is part of
6303600	6309600	the reason why casual critiques of hierarchies annoy me so much because the people I've seen
6309600	6316320	who are radically successful don't get there from power they get there from mobility but also
6316400	6327840	reciprocity and yeah um 100 right so when you say to take care to look out for and to take
6327840	6333040	care of I think you said to look out for what flesh that out what does that mean in the situations
6333040	6340560	that you've been in and how did that guide your behavior it's a it's a it's it's a literal constant
6341520	6350320	daily hourly by the minute attitude which is okay hey my my buddy needs me to to to move over there
6350320	6354400	and cover for that area that's what i'm going to do my buddy needs to me to bring him some more
6354400	6358960	ammunition my buddy needs to me to help him clean this weapon my buddy needs to you carry the boat
6358960	6363600	I need to pick up the boat because we're moving across the beach all these things so what are you
6363600	6368320	doing you're you're looking so what like you said moment to moment so what are you doing you're
6368320	6377120	looking for ways to be useful constantly how can I support my teammates what can I give to them how
6377120	6384000	can I make them how can I make their situation better right now and and that that guy that has
6384000	6389040	that attitude has going to have a great reputation in the sea yeah well then you can think too of
6389040	6394880	course then the fact that you're outstanding on any number of dimensions let's say that becomes an
6394880	6399920	asset of the team rather than something that's a competitive liability because like if you're
6399920	6404160	going to be looking out for me and I really believe that the fact that you're stronger and
6404160	6409360	smarter than me is actually really good because now I've got someone who's stronger than me and
6409360	6413520	smarter than me who's looking out for me and so whatever competitive jealousy there might have
6413520	6418640	been there could be easily subsumed under appreciation for those positive attributes
6419200	6423280	yes and we are going to work together because guess what you might be the strongest but I'm a
6423280	6427440	little bit faster than you right right right and you might be a good shot but I'm better in the water
6427440	6433360	than you are and we're going to be in the water and shooting so we're each going to have a chance to be
6433360	6442640	number one yes so the reason I went to that and how long did it take you to figure that out like
6442640	6449440	you said something interesting about assembling the image of an ideal seal in in your imagination
6449440	6454400	and so was that something that were you consciously aware of doing that while you were
6454400	6459360	doing that or did you see that you were doing that in retrospect unconscious and saw that I
6459360	6465200	did it in retrospect and the team that the support your teammate is something that you
6465200	6472000	hear immediately and if you listen to it it's you can't miss it now guys miss it guys definitely
6472000	6478640	miss it but if your eyes are open and your ears are open you can't miss it it's day one seal basic
6478640	6483600	indoctrination you take care of your swim buddy they literally say that day one they'll say take
6483600	6488240	care of your swim buddy and what does that mean in the in the swim buddy context what how would that
6488240	6494880	what does that translate to practically that means before Jordan gets inspected by the instructor
6495600	6499680	I take a look at Jordan's gear and make sure it's all squared away and say you're good to go
6500400	6506240	as opposed to seeing that your life jackets got a twisted strap and just sitting there looking
6506240	6511280	straight ahead no I want to make sure you're okay that's actually before I check myself I'm checking you
6513040	6516400	before I check myself I'm checking you I'm making sure that you're good to go
6517360	6521360	Jesus is partly why these claims the broad claims that are being made in the social
6521360	6528800	world at large now about hierarchical power being the the fundamental attribute of society
6528800	6537120	it's so disturbing to me because this this this is not true it's literally not true only when a
6537120	6543200	hierarchy becomes radically dysfunctional does individual power come to dominate the rest of
6543200	6549040	the time it's something like what you're saying is that and that's that's that's and and that's true
6549040	6554480	let's you know capitalism has a bad rap let's say morally because of its selfishness but the
6554560	6560000	functional organizations that I've seen that are business organizations if if the people in there
6560000	6565920	aren't motivated by the ethos that you're just that you're describing no no one bloody well
6565920	6570960	wants to work with them no one wants to buy their material no one wants to partner with them across
6570960	6577600	time they don't even want to go golfing with them so it's just not it's it's so not true it's
6578560	6582320	completely not true and that's I mean that's the essence of the books that I've written about
6582320	6589680	leadership is that story over and over again I had a I had a seal platoon commander that operated
6591200	6597120	via power his his authority and his power that's how we operated we did what he told us
6597120	6600560	because he told us to do it because he was the highest ranking guy and you better be quiet and
6600560	6604480	listen to me and it's going to be my plan and you all better just shut up and get on board with it
6605120	6612640	and we had a we had a mutiny we had a mutiny in that seal platoon where we we went to his boss
6612640	6618080	and said we're not working with this guy and he actually ended up getting fired
6619920	6624960	so everything you just said well you well and that's exactly right look there's there's
6626160	6634080	no stable organization no organization can run stably across time if its predicate of operation
6634080	6639920	is raw power and the reason for that at some point is that the people who are being tyrannized
6641120	6646880	are going to band together and say no we're not going to do this we're going to take you out
6647520	6652880	and so if you don't want to be taken out you can't exercise tyrannical power it's it's the intrinsic
6652880	6659440	weakness of tyranny this and to to confuse functional incompetent organizations with tyranny
6659440	6666400	is also to make a mockery of the fact that this cooperative ethos is actually the dominating
6666400	6675280	principle if the if the if the organization is functioning properly yeah and as i pointed out i
6675920	6680720	actually lived through that and i lived through the other end of the spectrum too when that platoon
6680720	6687920	commander got fired the platoon that commander that took his place was very humble listened
6687920	6693440	had an open mind gave us ownership told us to come up with a plan and we love that guy and
6693440	6698240	that's the guy that i try and emulate to this day and we would have followed that guy anywhere
6698240	6704800	and it it's it's precisely right and so that's not power that's not power it's precisely because he
6704800	6712320	didn't use his tyrannical power to to drive us to do what he what he wanted us to do
6712320	6716800	look whenever i've been in a situation and wanted to get the best out of the people that
6716800	6725520	are working under me or with me for that matter i see as much responsibility and authority to them
6725520	6732800	as possible partly because one of my predicates of operation is that if i'm going to engage in an
6732800	6740640	enterprise with you and i have to tell you what to do and or if i told you what to do you would
6740640	6746160	do a better job i should find a different person all that is is indication that i chose the wrong
6746160	6750720	person if you're the right person i'm going to grant you as much autonomy as possible partly
6750720	6755120	because then you get to have your own domain partly then because you're self-sufficient
6755120	6759840	partly because you do better but even more so because then you're fully committed to the task
6761120	6765680	and i i don't believe that anybody occupies a position of leadership for long who doesn't
6765680	6771040	know those things and they're certainly not effective if they don't know them no they're not
6771040	6779360	and i i talk to leaders all day every day in every every possible industry that you can think of
6779360	6786320	and it's one of the things that i end up saying a lot to leaders is you know when if you're working
6786320	6791680	for me jordan and you come to me with a plan of how you want to execute a project or an operation
6791680	6798320	or a task my goal my goal is that we're going to use your idea that's my goal my goal is that
6798320	6803200	whatever you present to me if it's the if it's going to get the job done we're good we're going
6803200	6807760	with it you know then at least the person can learn from what they're doing and be better the next
6807760	6813680	time right if it's minimally viable why not let them run it sometimes an emergency and you can't
6813680	6820000	do that but yeah yeah and by the way if there's urgency and i can't do that okay by this time
6820000	6824800	you and i have built an up enough trust that you know that if i say hey we need to go over there
6824800	6830160	right now you go yep got it right right so so we do get into situations like that happens right
6830160	6834320	and that's that's something you don't want to do too often because just as we discussed earlier
6834320	6839920	you burn up your leadership credibility by doing that so you can use power if you're a leader but
6839920	6845040	but judiciously and seldom and you need a good rationale and people have to trust you and so
6845040	6849840	that's the other issue is that we could we could think about the preconditions for trust because
6850480	6855760	if the organization isn't running on trust then everybody's at each other's throat constantly
6855760	6861920	and all there is is backbiting and confusion and so to trust means i i have to i have to
6862880	6869200	i have to what would i say i have to have faith in your motives and i have to see that you're doing
6869200	6874240	your best to align your motives with mind and i have to believe that that's genuine because
6874240	6878320	otherwise the enterprise isn't going to succeed given all the other things it's going to have to face
6879840	6886080	yeah it's uh it's another you know you bring up the term alignment and when i work with companies
6886080	6892880	sometimes sometimes we'll start talking about alignment and and quite frankly
6894160	6901680	in most cases vast majority of cases if you and i are at a company if we go high enough
6901680	6908560	high enough up what i call the the ladder of alignment if we go high enough up that ladder
6908560	6914320	we'll get to a point where we're going to be aligned because look right definitely we're trying to
6915280	6918720	take care of our team we're trying to provide a good service to our clients and we're trying
6918720	6924640	to be profitable and and if look if that's what we're trying to do and 99.9 of the times the
6924640	6930000	companies that i work with i have to talk them through this but i can say we can get to a point
6930000	6937440	where we are aligned now what yeah alignment has like a like a like a like a cousin or or maybe a
6937440	6944320	step cousin called agenda where where you've got your agenda over here and i've got my agenda over
6944320	6947680	here and you're trying to get more funds for your department i'm trying to get more funds for my
6947680	6954000	department and so we can kind of sometimes it can feel like our agendas we're not aligned yeah
6954560	6960160	now oftentimes i say look if if jordan's agenda is to get more funding for his department so he
6960160	6965680	can invest more and make more money for the team his agenda is aligned and that's great that i have
6965680	6969920	no problem with your agenda it's when you know you're trying to create your own fiefdom because
6969920	6973120	you're going to leave the company and you're going to go do something else and i start to sense that
6973120	6979600	and and whenever yeah no that's going on underground and no one's really talking about it right right
6979600	6986160	when i get a company where they can't come to a they can't come to an agreement about something
6986160	6990160	they can't they cannot so we walk them up the the alignment ladder and all of a sudden you realize
6990160	6996000	oh wait a second this person's just trying to make money and this right right really wants to
6996000	7000080	take care of the team now i'll tell you i'll take them further up the alignment ladder and say listen
7000080	7004080	if you really want to make money and you want to take care of the team guess what if you have a
7004080	7008320	good team that you take care of you're going to make more money yeah yeah yeah so you can get aligned
7008880	7013920	unless people are starting to take care of themselves instead of take care of the team
7013920	7018320	which goes back to what we were just talking about which is also extremely short-sighted in my
7018320	7022880	estimation because for a bunch of reasons i i lined some of this out in in this new book
7023520	7030560	this i realized a long time ago that there isn't much difference there might be no difference
7030560	7036240	actually technically speaking in in taking care of yourself and in taking care of other people
7036240	7044800	and here's the reason so you might say well i'm one person and everyone else is a group of people
7044800	7049200	and so there's that competition between me as one person and what this one person wants
7049200	7055520	and the group but that's not true because i'm actually a group and the reason i'm a group is
7056080	7062640	well there's me today but there's me over the next week and there's me over the next month and then
7062640	7067120	there's me over the next year and over the next five years and over the next 10 years and the me
7067120	7072640	that exists right now can't betray the me that's going to exist next week by doing something
7072640	7078000	short-sighted and impulsive that will you know produce a burst of impulsive pleasure but will
7078000	7085120	compromise the future and so if i'm taking myself into account seriously which i'm an
7085120	7091680	entity that has multiple incarnations let's say across very large spans of time then i immediately
7091680	7096400	have a community that i have to serve i have to serve the 80 year old person that i'm going to become
7097040	7102480	and the difference between that and serving 80 year old people in the community is negligible
7103040	7108320	it's the same thing so if i'm taking care of someone in a in a senior's home for example
7108880	7114080	there the difference between that and how i'm going to be taken care of when i'm 80 is negligible
7114800	7122240	and so there's no there's there's there's no way out of the ethical demand of of serving the group
7122240	7127760	even if you're even if your selfishness is is is of the most enlightened kind
7129680	7133200	well that's one of the most beautiful things about this about this
7134800	7143360	whole thing conceptually is that if i put the team before myself if i put the mission and the team
7143360	7149760	before myself and by being a good team player i i i lift up jordan and i and i make you look good
7149760	7156640	and i give you the support you need the beautiful thing about this is eventually i am going to win
7157280	7163760	right i'm 100 going to win and people get short-sighted as you're talking about where i think
7163760	7169360	you know what if i can if i can pull this project away from jordan i can raise my head up and get
7169360	7172880	some credit for this the boss is going to look at me and he's probably going to give me a promotion
7172880	7180000	and that that might work once that might work once yeah or twice yeah and then my reputation is oh
7180000	7182960	you don't want jocco on your team because he's the one that's going to be maneuvering around
7182960	7188720	trying to make himself look good instead of trying to accomplish the mission yeah so ultimately if
7188720	7194880	if you take care of people if you're a good seal if you're a good team player you will win in the
7194880	7199760	end that's what's going to happen and yes and you win you'll win surrounded by people who are
7199760	7205840	thrilled to death that you won and so and that's that's that's a much better form of winning than to
7205840	7213760	be bitter and alone yeah because you've snatched something on the back of the fallen right right
7213760	7218560	absolutely and and the fact that it's own you know you can only get away with that once or twice is
7218560	7224160	dead relevant because human beings are very sensitive to negative emotion we remember and one of the
7224160	7230800	things we really remember is betrayal and so if if you don't play the game straight and you have to
7230800	7235200	play the game over and over with the same people then you're dead in the water and then you're
7235200	7239600	going to be in your own little hell you're going to think well why does it why won't anybody play
7239600	7244880	with me and the answer to that is well you don't play fair and people gave you a chance a few times
7244880	7252000	and you demonstrated that and like there's no coming back so yeah and the reason I went off on
7252000	7259600	this tangent is because you asked me your mission now what am I doing now you bet you bet and I
7259600	7268640	think that along the way in my career in the in the navy I was so ingrained with the fact of
7268640	7279440	trying to be a good teammate yeah that when I retired I kept just trying to help people out
7279520	7284320	and say hey you know what I I I can teach you something about leadership do you want to know
7284320	7288320	something about leadership I can I can maybe I can help you with this or I can at least talk you
7288320	7293120	through and maybe I can share some stories of what I've learned about human nature and and that way
7293120	7298160	you don't have to learn those lessons by beating your head up against the wall and and then maybe
7298800	7303200	I can help you out with hey putting some stuff together that you can take as supplements and
7303200	7307280	that's going to make you a little bit healthier and stronger and and and by the way we're we're
7307280	7312320	trying to rebuild our community in New England where we came from where we used to have a bunch
7312320	7317200	of factories making clothes and maybe we could rebuild that and that way so great so there's
7317200	7322960	a question and so so tell me tell me about that so because it's it's kind of a surprise right
7323440	7328320	to you have a clothing line I think well that's so that's so funny and I that that
7328320	7333520	jockel has a clothing line it's it's so cool that that's the case and not not expected so
7333520	7340320	I knew there was a backstory there so I don't imagine that it stems from an obsession with fashion
7342800	7347360	you called it do okay so so what happened and and why did you get interested in it and what's
7347360	7355440	going on okay so I was you know I started my podcast and I was interacting with people and I
7355440	7362800	talk about jujitsu a lot Brazilian jujitsu I'm a very big supporter of people training jujitsu
7362800	7367520	and mixed martial arts in general but I am absolutely a jujitsu guy so a lot of people
7367520	7372560	started doing jujitsu and they started training and and so they would ask me that the the uniform
7372560	7379920	for jujitsu is called a gi and people would ask me hey I'm starting jujitsu or I started jujitsu
7379920	7387600	and I need to get a gi what kind should I get and I knew from having gays over the years that
7387600	7397040	gays were made in China and whatever horrible slave labor scenarios are happening there and
7397040	7402640	I knew that there was also one company up in Maine and I'm from New England as well one company
7402640	7409360	up in Maine that was actually making these jujitsu gays in America and and I had seen
7409360	7414640	them online and and the story was kind of presented online that this guy named Pete
7414640	7421520	he was a New England kid and saw the factories get shut down and we all you know we all did that
7421520	7426480	we all saw when I was growing up the factories there was no there was no one in them yep and and
7426480	7434560	he saw that and he was also a jujitsu guy and so he wanted to make gays jujitsu gays in America
7435280	7440960	as he started to go down that path he realized that the material that you would get to sew
7440960	7446000	together a gi was not produced anywhere in America so he decided he was going to get a loom
7446000	7453520	to weave this material and he starts asking around and poking around and eventually finds
7453520	7459120	that in a 500,000 square foot abandoned factory in Lewiston, Maine there is one loom that hadn't
7459120	7467520	been shipped overseas and the woman that kind of owned it was planning to one day put that loom
7467520	7474320	in a museum and he said I'll buy it from you and so he bought this massive loom you know it's as big
7474320	7480320	as a couple beds put together weighs thousands and thousands of pounds and he gets some of his
7480320	7484960	buddies and they go and drag this loom out of this factory and they take it apart what a cool
7484960	7491600	finding yeah what a remarkable piece of equipment completely remarkable and he finds a guy he finds
7491600	7496800	people that knew about these things find some old timers there was a guy named Lenny who's since
7496800	7502800	died but he used to work on looms and he hired him and said why we he says what do you want to do
7502800	7508400	he said we got to make this thing work so he starts making he starts weaving this material gets this
7508400	7513600	thing up and running so one day and I'm following this story I've been following I've been following
7513600	7520160	that story for three or four years and I'd actually reached out to him and said hey man I know you're
7520160	7525120	up in Maine I'm from up there um what do you think you know can I get some of your geese I'd like to
7525440	7528720	have some of your geese and how much are they or whatever and I wouldn't even hear back from him
7530000	7534320	because he's in Maine these guys you know I make fun of him because he's up in Maine he's in
7534320	7542560	Farmington Maine population 7000 so anyways one day I'm doing like a live social media interaction
7542560	7548000	with people and someone says hey I'm just starting to get to what kind of geese should I get and I
7548000	7552080	said I'll tell you what you should get an origin geese and by the way I said if anybody on here
7552080	7556240	knows this guy named Pete Roberts that runs that company up there if you could please tell him I
7556240	7561600	want to talk to him that'd be really cool so a few days go by and I get like a message that says hey
7561600	7567040	I reached out through my business connections and I found this guy Pete Roberts here's his number
7567040	7574480	or whatever here's his email so I say all right great so we set up a Skype call this was a few
7574480	7582640	years ago and we meet each other and we talk for four hours and I come walking out of my office
7582640	7587040	and my wife says it sounds like you were talking to yourself in there because we were just you know
7587040	7595200	we were on the same page so I ended up flying up to Maine we had a steak and we had a handshake
7595200	7604400	and we merged and started working together and what was great was he had this great people up there
7604480	7609040	and was building these geese but he didn't have a platform he's in Farmington Maine
7609040	7613920	so there's not a bunch of jiu-jitsu studios in Farmington Maine well I had luckily a platform
7613920	7618960	to talk to people right well and no matter how good your product man and everyone needs to know
7618960	7624320	this the world will not beat a pathway to your doorway for your damn product you need to pay
7624320	7629760	attention to sales and marketing and you can't be contemptuous of it it's like who the hell's
7629760	7637360	gonna buy something they don't know about so we shook hands we started working together and
7638320	7641920	once so then we started making jiu-jitsu geese and believe it or not you know now we had a bunch
7641920	7645600	people that wanted these jiu-jitsu geese because they're the best in the world they're made in America
7645600	7653600	they're made by Americans with their American cotton and woven on American loom so it's just
7653600	7661200	it's a beautiful thing it's a beautiful thing and and one day I was in the airport and I'm
7661200	7665600	sitting there in the airport as we're selling a bunch of jiu-jitsu geese and I'm looking around
7665600	7671840	and I called up P and I said hey P I said how many people do you actually know that do jiu-jitsu
7671840	7677600	and he said he's like I don't know like maybe 50 or 100 and I said how many people do you know
7677680	7684400	that wear jeans and he said everybody and I said why aren't we making jeans and he said
7685200	7690720	let me let me go so the next thing we did was we started making jeans because because
7692720	7699520	because the iconic American jeans that you wear aren't made in America the iconic American jeans
7699520	7705680	that people think represent America they're not made in America and and that's wrong and and the
7705680	7711440	other crazy thing about this is you know do you make good jeans we make the best jeans in the world
7711440	7716240	do they have spandex in them they do they do they have their they have a little bit of stretch in
7716240	7722160	them we've got a heavy pair and a lighter pair and yeah they're it's great and where can people find
7722160	7729280	these? how do they look for them? originusa.com guys if you go to jaco.com you can find all this
7729360	7737600	stuff and and um so we started everybody needs good jeans then we started making boots and
7737600	7742080	and we're making everything we're making you know we we started making a bunch of supplements and
7742080	7748560	that started from I drink tea another shocking thing you might want to know it is it is shocking
7750000	7754560	I'm married to a Brit and at some point I started drinking tea and so I started making tea
7754560	7761280	and then I started making other supplements and and again it was like make high quality stuff
7762160	7768960	that works and people need it they want it and we're doing that thing of being a teammate
7769600	7778000	of helping people out so that I knew there was a good story in that clothing yeah it's a great
7778000	7783520	story it's a great story absolutely if you've ever seen a I don't know maybe you could help me
7783520	7787280	with my with my personality you know what I like about that too I've learned something in the last
7787280	7796960	while like I I noticed very much that people allow a casual and unconscious contempt to stop them from
7798960	7804560	well to elevate the status of what they're doing I would say but also to
7805680	7810480	to allow them the luxury of not having to consider the importance of all the things
7810480	7818480	they're not doing now and that stops them from taking opportunities so you know well
7819360	7824240	it's I was watching the show last night it was The Devil Wears Prada and it was about fashion
7824240	7830560	industry and this girl who starts you instantly thought of me absolutely I thought that's right
7830560	7836960	the Jock Jocko fashion special but this girl she has contempt for the fashion industry you know
7837040	7841360	and that's portrayed as a moral virtue and I wasn't on her side to begin with I thought no you
7841360	7846160	know there's probably something to this and what you should do is shut up and learn about it before
7846160	7851600	you criticize it but it's more comfortable in some sense to have contempt for things you know and
7851600	7857360	it's so interesting to talk to you about your clothing line you know you saw opportunity there
7857920	7864080	in all sorts of ways and it fitted into this context of let's say of being a broader service
7864080	7868320	and because you didn't have contempt for it at all at any level for the machinery for the
7868320	7873200	manufacturing for the fact of making clothing for having your name associated with that for all of
7873200	7878720	that it then it enables you to see an opportunity there and to do something immediately and then
7878720	7885040	to make an enterprise grow and work and so that's another thing is that that that casual contempt
7885040	7891280	for what you can't do that's that's a real ethical mistake yeah that one will definitely I see
7891280	7897600	among academics you know there's always contempt for businessman and and and and the immorality
7897600	7902400	of the capitalist enterprise and then I see among businessmen you know contempt for intellectualism
7902400	7907200	in the ivory tower and I think that's not doing either of you guys much good you know because
7907200	7913520	you both have something to bring to the table in a real sense and some appreciation for what the other
7913520	7918640	one knows that you don't is well worth everyone's attempt and then everybody gets to win too it's
7918640	7923440	like well great man you've got this business enterprise more power to you and and then you
7923440	7928400	can say too well you know great you teach all these people and you have this advanced learning and
7928400	7934320	isn't the world better because we can both bring that to the table no need for for that envy not
7934320	7942160	at all just it just contaminates things yeah unless you let your ego slide in there and
7942160	7947760	and you start to think well I've been studied so hard and yet I'm only making whatever I'm making
7947840	7953040	as a yeah well that's that's a huge part look it's a huge part of the culture war I believe is that
7953040	7958880	there's a there's a tremendous resentment in the university about the fact that
7960400	7967040	high level intellectual endeavor doesn't attract disproportionate salary when other occupations do
7967680	7974000	but it certainly has no shortage of other rewards you know absolute job security being one of them
7974080	7980400	and freedom for that matter so anyways anyways I'm actually I've been surprised that
7980960	7986880	in the all you know there's all this talk in America right now about the divisiveness in America
7986880	7993600	and I don't yeah I've been surprised that the the the ego hasn't come up more often because
7993600	8000880	you mean as a topic as a as a as a causal effect yeah yeah okay sure yeah of the fact that
8001680	8008400	well I go to have a conversation with someone and I just think that I'm right I think that
8008400	8014080	my viewpoints are right and your viewpoints are wrong and worse worse not just wrong
8014720	8021920	contemptible that's like the ultimate expression of wrong right they're beneath my consideration
8021920	8027600	right yeah and that's that's not good that's definitely not good how do I how do I listen
8027680	8033920	to anything that you say how do I how do I find any common ground with you if I think that what you
8033920	8038480	think is contemptible and so therefore we can't have a conversation if we don't have a conversation
8038480	8042560	we can't find any mutual ground and that means we can't find solutions to the problems that we're
8042560	8048480	facing and yes and it means when push comes to shove we have to fight yes it does yeah
8049600	8052000	I'm here to tell you that's not a good option
8052000	8064240	you know that's a good place to stop fair enough that was great man thank you appreciate it I loved
8064240	8072800	it well thank you appreciate it yeah so it's good to see you it's good to see you too and it's so
8072800	8077600	it's so nice to see that that all of what you're talking about is finding its audience
8078560	8084720	I like the kids books too we never talked about them oh yeah the kids books I I I feel like
8087920	8096640	there is no more there's no better gratification for me than the handwritten letters the the the
8096640	8100960	emails that I get but mostly the handwritten letters from kids that are six seven eight nine
8100960	8105600	years old just did my first pull-up got an a on my math test oh isn't that cool
8106400	8111600	it's right yes I get better how could you have anything better than that to know that you were
8111600	8115360	part of that so so tell me about that maybe we'll stop with that tell me about that
8116240	8122160	like tell tell me about the kids books how many you've self-published them how many have sold well
8122160	8128960	I so I didn't I didn't self-publish all of them okay I the first two went through normal publisher
8129680	8135440	and what happened was so so the first one is called way the warrior kid and and right
8135440	8142160	basically I have four kids myself three daughters one son as I was raising my kids I couldn't really
8142160	8149200	find books that articulated the values that I might want my children to be reading about
8149760	8156720	and so I wrote my own books so the the first one way the warrior kid it's a kid he's bullied
8156720	8161360	he doesn't know his timetable so he thinks he's stupid he doesn't know how to swim so he can't
8161360	8167360	do any of the fun stuff that the other kids are doing and he's he's getting bullied common things
8167360	8173120	that kids face and he kind of breaks down last day of school everything kind of hits him at once
8173120	8178480	and he goes home and he remembers that his uncle is coming to stay with him for the summer and his
8178480	8183600	uncle his uncle is in the SEAL teams and he presents all these problems that he's having to his uncle
8183600	8187520	and his uncle says listen we can solve these problems but you got to commit it's going to
8187520	8192800	take discipline it's going to take hard work teaches the kid how to study teaches the kid
8192800	8197360	how to make flash cards teaches the kid how to eat right teaches the kid how to work out
8197360	8200400	brings the kid did you get two classes so he learns how to defend himself
8201280	8206560	kid goes back to school and he's he's in a much better place and and so then that series carries
8206560	8212160	on with different types of situations that kids get into and so I wrote the first one way the
8212160	8217680	warrior kid the second one marks mission and then I had written a kid's book a kid's book called
8217680	8227760	Mikey and the Dragons and and I had written it I finished it in August and I talked to my publisher
8227760	8231520	and I said hey you know I wrote this kid's book I'm sorry you know it sorry I didn't let you know
8231520	8235760	earlier but I really want the book to come out for Christmas and my publisher said yeah well you
8235760	8239280	know that's not really gonna happen and I said yeah but I really wanted to come out by Christmas
8239280	8246240	and by this time I think I'd written like three New York Times bestselling books for whatever
8246240	8252640	that's worth so it wasn't like I was you know scrapping around trying to throw this together I
8252640	8259600	had a pretty good vision of what to do here and I think there's a lot yeah so I said please can I
8259600	8266160	you know get this thing published by Christmas and they and they said they said there's no
8266160	8274880	scenario where this book by Christmas and I said I said are you sure and they yeah yeah
8274880	8280800	and I said watch this and so I started publishing about a week yep I started my own publishing
8280800	8286880	company we finished the the art inside the book and the book came out before Thanksgiving
8287760	8295520	and that was the beginning of of jocco publishing and so yes I've published it and then I just wrote
8295520	8301840	the the latest Way the Warrior Kid book Way the Warrior Kid 4 field manual and and again the most
8301840	8306560	rewarding thing that that happens to me on a daily basis is I get to open up letters from kids that
8306560	8312560	are seven eight nine ten eleven years old that just you know did their first pull up or ran a mile in
8312560	8318240	a certain amount of time or they so cool they like it's so cool to see that because I mean
8319600	8325680	it's it's an unbelievably deep instinct that makes that satisfying like I have the same
8325680	8332560	experience I don't ever see anything as satisfying as getting a message from someone who says
8333680	8338640	I've followed what you've been talking about and here's what I've done that's improved my life because
8338640	8344800	of it it's this is there's a you know when you read online comments the negative ones
8345840	8353600	are salient right they've got potency but and people are wired to feel more negative emotion than
8353600	8359520	positive emotion it it affects us more more we feel a loss more strongly than we feel in
8359520	8368000	equivalent gain the one exception to that might be those kinds of letters they're so salient and
8368000	8372640	it's really curious I mean that must be the deep that must be something like the deep instinct of
8372640	8379920	fatherhood that that pleasure that's intrinsic in watching someone who's younger younger generally
8379920	8387120	speaking not always but generally speaking thrive it's so satisfying and yeah I think that goes back
8387120	8394320	to the to the concept of being a good teammate yes definitely it's the deepest part of it and you're
8394320	8401520	helping someone get on the correct path when they're eight years old and you you know when I
8401520	8408080	people say all me all the time the parents write me too the parents say hey you know thank you I got
8408080	8414640	more out of this book than my kids did right they say as well that the the the way that these books
8414640	8419840	come together it's like you're being a good teammate because you're putting someone on the right path
8419840	8424400	at a young age I always people say I wish I would have had this book when I was right right well
8424400	8431200	yes absolutely me too that's a father between pages that it is exactly that because the fundamental
8431200	8436640	role of a father as far as I can tell is encouragement and I mean that technically is that
8437440	8446160	you your job is to instill courage in or to or to or to encourage courage I suppose in in in your
8446160	8451280	children to make them resilient in that manner to make them confident in their ability to face the
8451280	8456000	world but also able to face the world and that warrior kid book it's such a different approach
8456000	8460880	to the problem of bullying it reminded me when you were talking about it about the Simpsons there's
8460880	8466320	Nelson months is the bully in the Simpsons and he's quite a complex character actually and if he
8466320	8471600	bullies you there's a pretty high probability that the reason he's doing it is because you're doing
8471680	8476560	something stupid and contemptible so he's got this kind of corrective function
8476560	8481920	and he's not a bad kid even though he's a bully some of his bully compatriots are bad kids but
8481920	8487120	he's not he's from a family that's not doing well he has his reasons for for what he's like
8487120	8492640	but he is kind of a corrective you know and there's a scene too in The Simpsons where one of the
8492640	8499600	teacher says to Ralph poor Ralph the children are right to laugh at you Ralph which is a hilarious
8499600	8506160	line but also absolutely terrible but you know in your warrior kid book the message there is
8509760	8515440	one way of dealing with your inadequacies is to rid yourself of them
8516560	8520960	and it isn't self-evident that people who point out your inadequacies are your enemy
8522640	8526320	now that doesn't mean that bullies can't exploit and it doesn't mean that bullying
8526320	8533760	isn't reprehensible but by the same token you know critics a critic who points out a weakness
8533760	8538480	has actually offered you a pathway to development a true pathway to development
8540400	8546640	so and your your attitude to the kid was look kid no one's going to laugh at you if you're the
8546640	8552720	best swimmer or maybe you don't even have to be the best but but you could swim you could be
8552720	8560400	stronger you know you could you could elevate yourself yeah it's um it's it's it's so fun to
8560400	8564480	write these books because i mean i got first of all i got to experience it and you know i always
8564480	8568400	tell people people say oh did you get bullied because i'm i'm a bigger guy now i was like oh
8568400	8572240	when you're 10 you get bullied by 11 year olds that's right exactly always going to be somebody
8572240	8578080	that's bigger than you um in the second book the bully is like a psychological bully his name is
8578080	8584640	Nathan James and Nathan he's not physically threatening you but he's he's making fun of you
8584640	8588560	and he's picking on you and he'll take it to the point where he might you know feel some
8588560	8595360	repercussions but then he'd be quiet and so you know this kid mark says to his uncle hey i'm gonna
8595360	8604480	fight this kid i'm gonna fight him and the uncle says well okay if it comes to that but before you
8604480	8612080	fight him so that's when you published yourself i presume uh no no no this was this was still this
8612080	8619200	was still um this is book two oh really okay well my mistake i it's surprising well that was a while
8619200	8623760	ago you think you could get a book like that published now i'm not a hundred percent sure
8623760	8627440	i've got another i've got a i wrote a novel that's coming out which would you probably touch on
8628320	8634080	which which went through like multiple screenings to make sure that it wasn't offensive and whatever
8634080	8640400	else uh Nathan James the bully he picks on the kids but he talks and and his uncle you know
8640400	8644960	the kid mark says hey i want to fight this kid and his uncle says okay if it comes to that but
8644960	8650800	before you fight him i want you to gather some intel he says what do you mean gather some intel
8650800	8657120	i want you to collect some intelligence i want to know why he acts this way and so he watches
8658160	8662880	mark watches this kid Nathan James for a couple days and he says goes back and reports to his uncle
8662880	8670080	this kid he he doesn't eat healthy he eats potato chips half a bag of potato chips he's dirty he
8670080	8675040	doesn't change his clothes his socks don't match he's got holes in his jeans he's a slob totally
8675040	8681360	lacks discipline i think i should fight him and then he says well why do you think he's like that
8682480	8686560	you need to do further intel and i'm sure you can see where this is going eventually follows him
8686560	8691120	and realize the kid is kind of on his own and the reason he has a bag of potato chips a half a
8691120	8696560	bag of potato chips is because his mom's not home at night and there's no dad to be found and
8696560	8701040	and we don't even know what's going on but he lives in some in some apartment building above
8701040	8706000	a auto repair shop and and maybe his jeans wears the same jeans every day because that's the only
8706000	8713120	pair he's got and so instead of fighting this kid maybe you should try and help him and that's
8713120	8719040	where that goes so yeah there's a there's another novel that i wrote which is coming out in the fall
8719040	8728000	is um it it's it's it's definitely going to be interesting what the critics say about it i'm
8728000	8734400	looking forward to it i'm looking forward to their um their assessment it's about a it's about a
8735280	8744640	two brothers one brother is kind of a handsome kind of street smart kid smart good-looking the other
8744640	8755200	brother is uh got some kind of a unidentified disorder mental disorder mental handicap and
8755200	8762640	basically is an autistic guy and he's obsessed with washing machines and he works at a laundry mat
8763680	8771440	and um well the the laundry mat is eventually going to be up for sale and the brother the younger
8771440	8777920	brother who is a little bit more street smart decides if that happens my my older brother is
8777920	8781920	never going to be happy again because he's not going to have this laundry mat and he decides
8781920	8789120	he's going to do something to get money to buy that laundry mat and the only way he can figure
8789120	8793520	out to do that is by doing something that's not legal so he goes for it and well that's the story
8793520	8798160	but and that's coming out when comes out in the fall it's called final spin
8798720	8801280	how long have you been working on that
8802800	8812000	huh well i write about i probably i wrote an original draft of it probably 15 years ago
8813280	8819040	and then just kind of set it aside and then this is then i i dusted it off because it never left
8819040	8824160	my mind uh-huh story never left my mind because ultimately it's about a you know it's about can
8824160	8828800	you be happy and what kind of sacrifices are you willing to make to be happy and what about people
8828800	8831440	that are stuck in a rut you know when i was growing up there was all these kids that were
8831440	8837920	smarter than me and funnier than me and better athletes than me and and i would look around and
8837920	8845200	they would get stuck in a rut right right and not really do anything and it would be a little bit sad
8845200	8850800	yes very and you know i was lucky enough like you said i i joined the navy and all of a sudden
8850800	8854720	had a goal and had an aim and wanted to be a good seal and that was enough to kind of put me in the
8854720	8860560	right direction yeah so what what's next what do you want where do you want to take this
8861120	8866000	what's your ambition my you're you're teaching people you're communicating with them on a very
8866000	8871360	broad level that's where do you see this going if it went where you want it to go
8872160	8877280	the the ambition the goal is to help more people is to help more people help more kids
8878000	8882400	become more confident help more leaders do a better job of leading their teams
8883280	8889360	help people be on a better path in their life healthier and and doing productive things in
8889360	8895680	the world that's i think the best thing i can do right now at this point yeah well that just seems
8895680	8902720	like generally speaking that just seems like the best i think well once it isn't clear why you would
8902800	8907280	be motivated to do anything else it's like that actually is the best thing you talked about these
8907280	8912560	letters it's like well what could you do that would be better than that i mean if you were as greedy
8912560	8920320	as you could possibly be you can't get better than that so it's so rewarding so yeah and and again
8920320	8926160	the biggest reward is is when you when you get a letter from somebody that decided they weren't
8926160	8930400	going to kill themselves yeah yeah right because they heard you talking on the podcast or they read
8930400	8934960	they read the book discipline equals freedom and they said wait a second i'm trapped why am i trapped
8935600	8942000	trapped because i'm blaming other people i'm trapped because i'm not sticking to the things
8942000	8947440	that i know i should do right and they get on the right path and you know they always say you
8947440	8952560	changed my life and i always say i didn't change your life you did which is the truth
8952560	8960560	thanks a lot thanks for having me man good seeing you good see you too
