Andrew Doyle is with me today. Andrew is a British comedian, playwright, journalist,

00:30.000 --> 00:37.040
political satirist and author who co-created the fictional character Jonathan Pye and the equally

00:37.040 --> 00:43.280
or perhaps even more fictional character Titania McGrath. He recently published his first book,

00:43.280 --> 00:51.040
Free Speech, Why It Matters, which came out in 2021, but previously published two more

00:51.040 --> 00:58.960
as the aforementioned Titania McGrath. The first of those was Woke, a guide to social justice

00:58.960 --> 01:05.600
published in 2019. And the second was my first little book of intersectional activism published

01:05.600 --> 01:13.360
in 2020. I haven't met Andrew before. I'm looking forward to talking with him about Free Speech and

01:13.360 --> 01:18.800
about his satire and about the intersection between those two and whatever else comes up.

01:18.800 --> 01:23.040
Thank you very much for coming on today. I'm looking forward to speaking with you.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.160
Thanks so much for having me.

01:24.400 --> 01:29.840
So, shall we start perhaps with the discussion of your book? I finished it yesterday.

01:31.360 --> 01:37.920
I've become notorious, I suppose, for my particular take on Free Speech. And so,

01:37.920 --> 01:45.120
it was a book that interested me. Tell me why you wrote it and what you learned and all of those

01:45.120 --> 01:50.720
things. Well, it's not the sort of book I ever envisaged that I would have to write. I think

01:50.720 --> 01:55.360
if you go back 10, 15 years, the idea that Free Speech, which is obviously the seedbed

01:55.360 --> 01:59.680
of all our liberties, would be something that we would have to defend, would have probably

01:59.680 --> 02:03.600
seemed a little bit ridiculous to me because I basically took it for granted. I thought that

02:03.600 --> 02:10.000
everyone was on that side. But I fear that something has happened, particularly over the

02:10.000 --> 02:16.480
past 10 years or so. And it is connected, I feel, with the rise of this social justice movement,

02:16.480 --> 02:19.920
what we might call critical social justice, or however we want to call it. A lot of people call

02:20.000 --> 02:25.680
it the woke movement. However you want to label that ideology, which at its heart has a real

02:25.680 --> 02:31.120
mistrust of Free Speech. And you hear it all the time in the kind of phrases that the activists use,

02:31.120 --> 02:37.360
phrases like words are violence or this kind of language normalizes hate or legitimizes hate or

02:37.360 --> 02:43.280
all this kind of thing. And there's a real genuine mistrust of the power of language to effectively

02:43.840 --> 02:50.080
corrupt the masses. And what I wanted to do, I suppose, was try and marshal a defence

02:50.640 --> 02:56.560
for this principle that I had always taken for granted. But at the same time, attempt to grapple

02:56.560 --> 03:01.520
with the concerns that people might have. Because my worry with the culture war, as we call it,

03:01.520 --> 03:06.480
is that you have two sort of extreme polls arguing against each other. And most people

03:06.480 --> 03:11.040
are caught in the middle. I think most people are broadly for the idea of Free Speech, but they

03:11.040 --> 03:17.040
have a few reservations, for instance, when it comes to demagogues espousing hate or hate against

03:17.040 --> 03:21.040
a particular minority group or something like that. Or people are concerned about the ways in which

03:21.040 --> 03:27.280
language can cause harm. And I don't think anyone would deny that words can be hurtful. So most

03:27.280 --> 03:32.880
people, I think, are somewhere in between and are open to persuasion. And I think my point,

03:32.880 --> 03:38.880
my principal argument in the book, is that absolute freedom of speech is always going to be

03:38.880 --> 03:44.720
better. And in fact, by promoting free speech, you're doing something to help those very people

03:44.720 --> 03:53.200
that you are concerned about. So recently, the Scottish Parliament passed a hate crime law

03:53.920 --> 04:01.360
that has its supporters and also its detractors. And I'd be interested in your feeling about that.

04:01.360 --> 04:05.520
Now, you said, I believe in this book, if I remember the statistics correctly, that

04:06.080 --> 04:15.600
there have been 120,000 incidents of police investigated speech hate crime in Britain in

04:15.600 --> 04:19.120
how long? That's been over the last five years or so?

04:19.120 --> 04:27.600
It's worse than that. The statistic, I quote, is between 2014 and 2019, there are 120,000 recorded

04:27.600 --> 04:32.720
incidents of non-crime. They call them non-crime hate incidents. And this is something which is

04:32.800 --> 04:37.600
now routine in the UK. I mean, obviously, I'm going to be talking about the UK and the US and

04:37.600 --> 04:42.000
Canada is a very different kettle of fish, I'm sure. And I'm sure a lot of the people who are

04:42.000 --> 04:45.840
watching won't be familiar with the problems we have in the UK. Of course, we don't have

04:45.840 --> 04:50.240
constitutional protection for free speech. We don't have a First Amendment. We don't have anything

04:50.240 --> 04:55.440
like that. So we are particularly vulnerable. And at the moment, unfortunately, in the UK,

04:55.440 --> 05:00.880
the police who are trained by the College of Policing who do issue very specific guidelines

05:00.880 --> 05:05.120
about this. And anyone can check this because if you go to the government's website on hate crime

05:05.120 --> 05:09.840
and hate speech, they make very clear what they're talking about. What they say is that there are five

05:09.840 --> 05:15.120
protected characteristics and these fall into race, gender, sexuality, gender identity and

05:15.120 --> 05:19.840
disability. I think I might misquote that, but there's one missing. But anyway, there are five

05:19.840 --> 05:26.000
protected characteristics. And if a victim, and they do use the word victim rather than complainant,

05:26.000 --> 05:33.440
if a victim perceives that any speech or crime was motivated by hatred towards any of those

05:33.440 --> 05:38.960
five protected characteristics, then it qualifies as a hate crime if it's criminal. If it's not

05:38.960 --> 05:43.920
criminal, if it's just speech or something like that, it qualifies as a non-crime hate incident.

05:43.920 --> 05:48.960
Police will investigate that. They will record that. And although non-crime incidents don't

05:48.960 --> 05:54.000
lead to prosecution, they do go on a criminal reference check that many people take. We call it

05:54.160 --> 05:58.320
disclosure and barring service here. So it can affect your employment prospects.

05:59.120 --> 06:02.720
And is that without a trial? That's recorded without a trial?

06:02.720 --> 06:06.480
Of course. So you get a quasi-criminal record.

06:06.480 --> 06:09.680
You get something flagged up, particularly if you're applying for a teaching job,

06:09.680 --> 06:12.160
say something like that where you're working with children, it's very important. And you get

06:12.160 --> 06:17.360
this thing flagged up. So it does have serious ramifications. But even beyond that, we have

06:17.360 --> 06:22.560
hate speech laws which are encoded into the Public Order Act, which is one example. But the

06:22.880 --> 06:28.720
main example is the Electronic Communications Act 2003. In this country, and I do quote the

06:28.720 --> 06:37.520
statistic in the book as well, we have roughly 3,000 people arrested a year for offensive things

06:37.520 --> 06:42.720
that they have said online. So in other words, nine people a day, roughly, the police in the UK

06:42.720 --> 06:47.200
are arresting. And people in the UK will be familiar with this, because if you see the Twitter

06:47.200 --> 06:50.960
accounts of various police forces, various police departments across the country, they often put

06:50.960 --> 06:54.800
things out like, you know, make sure you don't say anything offensive or thoughtless online,

06:54.800 --> 07:00.400
or we will be knocking on your door. They say these very kind of frightening things. There was a

07:00.400 --> 07:07.200
recent police display outside a supermarket in the UK. It went viral, this image. It was them

07:07.200 --> 07:13.360
next to a big digital billboard. And the slogan on the billboard was being offensive is an offense.

07:13.360 --> 07:17.520
And this was flanked by police officers who were socially distanced, but they were there and their

07:17.520 --> 07:22.880
masks, which made it seem slightly more sinister. They got in a lot of trouble for that, because

07:22.880 --> 07:27.520
people were saying, well, being offensive surely isn't a crime. But actually, the problem with

07:27.520 --> 07:31.360
that is that the police clearly thought it was a crime. And they, you know, they were acting on

07:31.360 --> 07:35.600
that basis. They'd obviously hadn't just concocted this billboard out of nothing, they'd really

07:35.600 --> 07:41.040
considered what it should say. And more to the point, actually, they were right. In this country,

07:41.040 --> 07:47.520
you can go to prison for jokes, for offensive remarks. And people have gone to prison,

07:47.520 --> 07:53.680
have been arrested routinely for causing offense. And of course, the notion of offense

07:53.680 --> 07:59.120
is incredibly subjective. In fact, in fact, the legal stipulation in the communications act

07:59.120 --> 08:03.120
is that you will have broken the law if the judge and jury deem that you have

08:03.760 --> 08:08.560
communicated material that is quote unquote, grossly offensive. Well, I don't know how you

08:08.560 --> 08:13.280
define that. I wouldn't know. And also, who defines it is the real question, as far as I'm

08:13.280 --> 08:18.880
concerned. I mean, I've looked into this legislation to some degree. And one of the things that struck

08:18.880 --> 08:26.560
me about it was that it seems to be purposefully left up to the hypothetical victim to define

08:27.200 --> 08:34.560
offense, which has become a subjective reality. And you can understand why that might be to some

08:34.560 --> 08:40.880
degree, because how would you define hate? And how would you define offense without, especially

08:40.880 --> 08:45.840
the latter, without making recourse to someone's subjective experience? But then, of course,

08:46.560 --> 08:51.760
well, we'll delve into that in a moment. I should start with the hard question, I suppose, which is,

08:52.720 --> 08:58.240
well, clearly, people can say hateful things. And those things can be damaging psychologically and

08:58.960 --> 09:03.280
physiologically, I suppose, if people are stressed enough. And the borderline is very

09:03.280 --> 09:11.200
difficult to identify. Why is it that people shouldn't just assume that you're a mean loudmouth and

09:11.200 --> 09:14.800
that they shouldn't pay any attention to you at all, because you're concerned about this?

09:15.440 --> 09:23.040
I mean, which is that's the general criticism of critics of hate speech, let's say. And so,

09:23.040 --> 09:28.160
why in the world aren't we aren't the people who are putting this forward just trying to make the

09:28.160 --> 09:33.840
world a nicer place? What's the big problem here? Well, I think a lot of people do assume that I'm a

09:33.840 --> 09:40.560
mean loudmouth. I think they assume that about most people who defend freedom of speech. And I'm sure

09:40.560 --> 09:44.960
the latter part of your question is absolutely right. Insofar as I imagine a lot of the people

09:44.960 --> 09:49.120
who are skeptical about free speech are, in fact, trying to make the world a better place. I don't

09:49.120 --> 09:54.960
think that's mutually exclusive. I mean, the problem here is that the legislation as it currently

09:54.960 --> 10:00.160
stands here means that, for instance, if you say something critical about me, and I perceive

10:00.160 --> 10:05.360
that it was motivated by hatred towards me on the basis of my sexuality, for instance, I could phone

10:05.360 --> 10:10.160
the police and that would be recorded and would appear on hate crime statistics in this in this

10:10.160 --> 10:14.720
country, because it's all about perception. That word is used about five or six times within the

10:14.720 --> 10:18.960
one passage in the in the hate crime legislation, the word perception of the victim. And again,

10:18.960 --> 10:23.680
I say victim, not complainant, which suggests a complete disregard for due process. But I suppose

10:23.680 --> 10:28.640
we can leave that aside. But the most common, the most common and the most frightening misconception

10:28.640 --> 10:33.840
I have found when it comes to people defending free speech is that they are doing so because they

10:33.840 --> 10:40.000
want to have the right to say appalling things about people with no comeback whatsoever. And

10:40.000 --> 10:44.880
they want to go back to some imaginary good old days, you know, where you could just be casually

10:44.880 --> 10:49.760
homophobic and racist and sexist and all the rest of it. And no one would call you out for that.

10:49.760 --> 10:53.200
Now, I don't know anyone who falls into that category. And most people who are,

10:54.160 --> 10:58.720
you know, advocating for free speech are doing so precisely because they are aware

10:58.720 --> 11:03.520
that in countries where free speech protections are meager, minorities tend to suffer the most.

11:03.520 --> 11:09.440
And in fact, there is a it seems to be a corollary to me that those who are genuinely

11:09.440 --> 11:14.240
for free speech are also for equal rights and protecting the vulnerable in society. And this

11:14.240 --> 11:18.080
perception, which I really find unpleasant, this perception that if you are standing up for this

11:19.040 --> 11:23.120
most foundational of principles of freedom of speech, if you're standing up for that,

11:23.120 --> 11:27.600
you can only be doing so if you have a nefarious motive. I mean, what a horribly pessimistic

11:27.600 --> 11:34.160
view of humanity. And it seems to be... Well, it seems to be a direct derivation of the hypothesis,

11:34.160 --> 11:46.960
for example, that all Western social organizations, particularly Western, are based on power and

11:47.040 --> 11:53.680
are best conceived of as tyrannical. And so if that's your view, why would you not assume that

11:53.680 --> 11:59.360
most use of speech is essentially an exercise of power in the service of tyranny?

12:00.080 --> 12:04.000
But then why would you assume that the government in control of any particular

12:04.560 --> 12:09.840
country isn't part of that tyranny that you're describing? It seems odd to me to be

12:10.880 --> 12:15.760
mindful of the potential for tyranny, but then to outsource all your individual liberties to the

12:15.760 --> 12:19.920
state. It seems contradictory to me. Well, I guess the way that that is

12:21.680 --> 12:28.320
elided over is by allowing the hypothetical individual victim to define the offense.

12:29.120 --> 12:33.760
This is the problem, though. I mean, the problem I've run into, and this is partly why I appreciated

12:33.760 --> 12:41.120
your book, is that increasingly, people are called upon to defend fundamental assumptions

12:41.120 --> 12:49.120
that were so taken for granted that virtually no one has an argument that's fully articulated at hand.

12:50.400 --> 12:55.280
When no one questions free speech, no one has to defend it thoroughly. As soon as it's questioned,

12:55.280 --> 13:02.400
well, it becomes an extraordinarily complicated problem. The same with gender identity. When

13:02.400 --> 13:05.840
no one's paying attention to it, it's obvious, but as soon as you have to think it through,

13:05.840 --> 13:13.040
it becomes a rat's nest to say the least. When I was in the UK a few years ago, I saw a number

13:13.040 --> 13:20.960
of things that I felt were disturbing. People seem to have accepted the omnipresence of CCTV

13:20.960 --> 13:28.080
cameras to a degree that I found horrifying. Frankly, I don't like CCTV cameras. I don't like

13:29.120 --> 13:35.200
the message they portray, which is that everyone is criminal enough so they should be

13:35.200 --> 13:41.680
surveyed all the time and someone needs to be watching. I noticed, too, in London in particular,

13:41.680 --> 13:49.840
that many buildings had instituted airport-level security so that you had to pass through a

13:49.840 --> 13:54.080
metal detector and have your bags checked, et cetera, while you were moving in and out of

13:54.080 --> 14:00.880
buildings. It struck me as quite horrifying given that, as far as I'm concerned, Great Britain and

14:00.960 --> 14:08.320
its legal and parliamentary traditions are at the epicenter of Western freedoms. I mean,

14:08.320 --> 14:12.880
you could make a case for France, I suppose, but not a strong one, as far as I'm concerned.

14:14.880 --> 14:22.000
Your citizens seem to have accepted this with virtually no problem. Now, on the heels of that,

14:22.000 --> 14:29.840
we have this multiplication of hate crime. That's as much a surprise to me as it is to you.

14:30.400 --> 14:34.800
You won't have seen all of the CCTV cameras believe. Apparently, they're absolutely everywhere. You

14:34.800 --> 14:41.280
can't walk anywhere in the UK without being potentially monitored. I'm not saying someone's

14:41.280 --> 14:46.480
watching you all the time, but things are being recorded and digitized. It's interesting to me,

14:46.480 --> 14:51.040
because I remember back in the early 2000s, when the government was trying to push through its ID

14:51.040 --> 14:56.640
card scheme and, broadly speaking, the left were unanimously against it. They didn't like this idea

14:56.640 --> 15:00.960
of living in a society where there's someone on the corner saying, papers, please. No one really

15:00.960 --> 15:07.120
wanted that. But we've become very docile and very accepting of the idea that we need to be

15:07.120 --> 15:10.560
coddled and monitored by the state. I mean, I know there's a recent debate about vaccine

15:10.560 --> 15:16.880
passports, and people seem very blasé about this idea that we might have to have our ID

15:16.880 --> 15:21.520
embedded and encoded onto a card to get anywhere or to do anything. I think there's

15:21.520 --> 15:25.280
something going on there and it is connected with what you've brought up in terms of hate

15:25.280 --> 15:29.840
crime legislation. We've just become accustomed. I mean, you mentioned specifically the problem in

15:29.840 --> 15:35.360
Scotland. And seriously, it relates very closely to what you're saying, because the SMP, who are the

15:35.360 --> 15:41.040
only really party with any clout in Scotland, that's the Scottish National Party. And it's never a

15:41.040 --> 15:44.240
good idea, is it, when you have one political party, which doesn't really have an opposition.

15:44.960 --> 15:50.160
They have a reputation for quite nanny, statious policies. They introduced a,

15:50.160 --> 15:54.160
what was it called, the named person scheme. It didn't go through in the end, but they wanted to

15:54.160 --> 15:59.280
assign every child born in Scotland with a state guardian. They effectively didn't trust

15:59.840 --> 16:04.480
the parents to raise their own kids. They have other examples, minimum pricing on alcohol or

16:04.480 --> 16:09.280
ban on two-for-one pizzas, because they don't trust poor people not to gain weight. So all

16:09.280 --> 16:14.320
sorts of these sorts of policies. But in this current hate crime bill, which has just sailed

16:14.320 --> 16:19.120
through because there's no opposition, Humza Youssef, the justice secretary, has pushed through,

16:19.120 --> 16:23.920
he specifically included an element to this bill, which says that they can criminalize you for things

16:23.920 --> 16:30.160
you say in the privacy of your own home. I mean, that's just a given. I would have never thought

16:30.160 --> 16:35.120
that anyone in this country would not consider that to be an incredible invasion on individual

16:35.120 --> 16:42.400
liberty. You can make a strong case for Scotland as the ground zero for many of the, developing

16:42.400 --> 16:48.400
many of the concepts that undergird the entire Western notion of freedom. And to see that emerging

16:48.480 --> 16:53.120
in Scotland is absolutely stunningly terrifying, as far as I'm concerned.

16:53.120 --> 16:58.480
Think of Mill Gibson with a face covered in woad shouting freedom as he's executed in that

16:58.480 --> 17:02.560
in Braveheart. You do think of Scotland as being associated with it, but honestly,

17:02.560 --> 17:05.520
Scotland for some reason, and I don't know what it is, and it might be to do that it's

17:05.520 --> 17:10.480
effectively this one party state, it seems to have this incredible sense. And they've really

17:10.480 --> 17:16.240
brought into this idea that unless they can police the thought and speech of their citizens,

17:16.240 --> 17:20.560
then they will just run a run a mock. It's there's another element to that bill. I don't

17:20.560 --> 17:24.000
know if you know about this. There's a specific element on the bill, which talks about the public

17:24.000 --> 17:30.080
performance of a play. So they've effectively said that they will criminalize public performances.

17:30.080 --> 17:35.200
So say if it can be deemed that those performances were designed to stir up hatred, that's the

17:35.200 --> 17:40.080
formulation stir up hatred. I'm not quite sure what that means necessarily. But the when when

17:40.080 --> 17:44.800
Humza Yousef was questioned about this in parliament, he actually said, well, theoretically a neo Nazi

17:44.800 --> 17:49.440
or someone from the far right could get together with a group of actors and put on a play to to

17:49.440 --> 17:54.400
recruit people to his cause. And as I said at the time, you know, I don't know any neo Nazis,

17:54.400 --> 17:58.240
but they're not into amateur dramatics. That's not their thing. They don't do that. They wouldn't

17:58.240 --> 18:02.240
get involved. And yet he's got this idea in his head that that is a feasible. I mean, it seems

18:02.240 --> 18:06.320
ridiculous. But it's not really because the ramifications are quite a quite serious. And

18:07.200 --> 18:11.520
the way it's just gone through without any opposition really, really troubles me. I mean,

18:11.520 --> 18:16.160
there have been modifications, I should say, in fairness. In the initial bill in the initial

18:16.160 --> 18:20.960
draft of the bill, they had said that you could be criminalized irrespective of intention. In

18:20.960 --> 18:26.160
other words, yes, if that was terrifying, awful. And you know, if you wrote a play that then

18:26.800 --> 18:30.160
stimulated someone to join the far right, then you were still responsible whether you intended

18:30.160 --> 18:33.760
it or not. Now the problem is, you know, with theatrical representation or any kind of artistic

18:33.760 --> 18:37.840
representation is sometimes you want to represent the worst aspects of humanity.

18:38.560 --> 18:42.640
Because that's part of drama and literature and all the rest of it. I mean, you would be,

18:43.200 --> 18:46.080
there would be no artistic freedom if that went through. So fortunately,

18:46.720 --> 18:52.800
that element of the bill was modified. Well, and also the attempt to reverse the idea that intent

18:52.800 --> 18:59.760
is important is that's even that's even more catastrophic. It's always been a miracle to me

18:59.760 --> 19:07.120
that our legal system ever became psychologically sophisticated enough so that intent rather than

19:07.120 --> 19:13.440
outcome was what mattered. Because you have to be a sophisticated thinker to see that someone has

19:13.440 --> 19:20.640
done damage to someone else. But and so the damage is real and market and troublesome and costly,

19:20.640 --> 19:28.000
all of that painful. But because the intent wasn't there, the severity of the action is

19:28.000 --> 19:32.640
dramatically mitigated. That's a sign of maturity and sophistication to note that. And the fact

19:32.720 --> 19:38.000
that it's built into the legal system is nothing short of remarkable. And then to remove that and to

19:38.960 --> 19:46.000
make the felt consequences, the arbiter of the reality of the situation is

19:46.000 --> 19:50.320
a dreadful assault on the integrity of the law as such, as far as I can tell.

19:50.880 --> 19:55.280
Well, moreover, it's something that everyone intuitively understands. We all understand

19:55.280 --> 19:59.360
the difference between murder and manslaughter. You know, we all understand that intent actually

19:59.360 --> 20:06.240
does, like you say, escalate the severity of a crime. And it's bigger than that, isn't it?

20:06.880 --> 20:10.480
Because this idea that intention doesn't matter is actually built into

20:11.120 --> 20:15.520
so much of this what we call social justice discourse. If you think of critical race theory,

20:16.080 --> 20:20.400
it's just a given that there are racist structures and you can be racist without

20:20.400 --> 20:24.800
intending to be racist. And I really do dispute that, because I think in order to be racist,

20:24.880 --> 20:30.160
intention has to be at the heart of that. Otherwise, it's incoherent to me. But this is really

20:31.520 --> 20:37.440
a degraded view of humanity, I feel, where we are effectively like marionettes,

20:38.480 --> 20:44.000
and that we're just being played, and that we don't have any agency anymore. And therefore,

20:44.960 --> 20:49.680
we can't be responsible for our own words, not just our actions. We can't be responsible for our

20:49.680 --> 20:54.400
own words and the ramifications. So we have to be controlled and we have to be stifled by the

20:54.400 --> 21:03.840
state. And it makes me very nervous. So I've been thinking through the importance of free speech,

21:03.840 --> 21:09.920
I suppose, from a psychological perspective. And it seems to me that, well, we can walk

21:09.920 --> 21:15.360
through some axioms and you can tell me what you think about them, if you would. So I mean,

21:15.360 --> 21:21.760
the first thing we might posit is that it's useful to think. It's better to think than not to think.

21:22.000 --> 21:27.440
That might seem self-evident, but thought can be troublesome and stir up trouble,

21:27.440 --> 21:36.160
and your thoughts can be inaccurate. So it's perhaps not that unreasonable to start the questioning

21:36.160 --> 21:45.200
there. But I think it was Alfred North-Whitehead who said that thinking allows our thoughts to die

21:45.760 --> 21:53.760
instead of us. And so he was thinking about the evolution of thought in some sense from a biological

21:53.760 --> 21:59.600
perspective. So imagine a creature that's incapable of thought has to act something out,

22:00.480 --> 22:05.520
a representation of the world or an intent. It has to be embodied. And then if that fails,

22:06.320 --> 22:12.160
well, it fails in action. And so the consequence of that might be death. It might be very severe.

22:12.880 --> 22:19.840
Whereas once you can think, you can represent the world abstractly, you can divorce the

22:19.840 --> 22:26.480
abstraction from the world, and then you can produce avatars of yourself, sometimes in the

22:26.480 --> 22:31.840
image like in dreams, let's say, or in literature and fiction and movies and so on, produce avatars

22:31.840 --> 22:39.360
of ourselves that are fictional, and then run them as simulations in the abstract world and

22:39.360 --> 22:46.880
observe the consequences. And we do that in our stories. We do that when we dream. We do that when

22:46.880 --> 22:54.400
we imagine in images and depict a dramatic scenario playing itself out. But then we also do that in

22:54.400 --> 23:00.000
words because we encode those images. It's one more level of abstraction. We encode those images

23:00.000 --> 23:06.640
into words, and those words become partial dramatic avatars, and then the words can battle

23:06.640 --> 23:12.880
with one another. So thought seems to work, let's say verbal thought. You ask yourself a question.

23:14.000 --> 23:19.760
You receive an answer in some mysterious manner. There's an internal revelation of sorts. That's

23:19.760 --> 23:25.120
the spontaneous thought. When you sit down to write a book, thoughts come to you, perhaps because

23:25.120 --> 23:30.240
you pose yourself a question. And no one knows how that works, but we experience it, that thoughts

23:30.240 --> 23:35.040
manifest themselves in the theater of our imagination. So that's the revelatory aspect. And then

23:35.040 --> 23:40.560
there's the critical aspect, which is, well, now you've thought this and perhaps you've written it

23:40.560 --> 23:47.120
down. Can you generate counter positions? Are there universes that you can imagine where this

23:47.120 --> 23:52.800
doesn't apply? Are there situations where it doesn't apply? Are there better ways of formulating that

23:52.800 --> 23:59.680
thought? But I would say with regard to critical thought, and to some degree with regard to productive

23:59.680 --> 24:09.440
thought, an indeterminate proportion of that is dependent on speech. I don't think it's unreasonable

24:09.440 --> 24:16.080
to point out that thought is internalized speech, and that the dialectical process that constitutes

24:16.080 --> 24:21.840
critical thinking is internalized speech. So you and I are engaging in a dialectic enterprise.

24:21.840 --> 24:28.160
You'll pause at something and I'll respond to it and you'll respond to that. And we're in a kind

24:28.160 --> 24:34.480
of combat. There's some cooperation about it as well. And we're attempting to formulate a truth

24:34.480 --> 24:40.000
more clearly, at least in principle, if we're being honest. We do that when we're speaking.

24:40.000 --> 24:44.560
So our thought, the quality of our thought is actually dependent on our ability to speak

24:44.560 --> 24:50.160
our minds. Absolutely. And then, so go ahead. Well, I couldn't agree more because I think

24:50.720 --> 24:55.920
speech is the way in which we collaborate on our thoughts. That's how it works. You

24:55.920 --> 24:59.920
refine those thought processes that you've described. I mean, I'm no psychologist, but I

24:59.920 --> 25:05.680
understand this basic premise that we have these various thoughts that are continually in conflict

25:05.680 --> 25:10.640
within ourselves, unless we're able to articulate them and to engage in others through that process,

25:10.640 --> 25:14.720
through that transactional process of speech, then those thoughts are never refined and they

25:14.720 --> 25:20.080
remain in this kind of infancy. And this is why- Yes, well, they're as refined as we can make them

25:20.080 --> 25:25.040
as individuals. But that's also assuming that you even have the words, which you also learned

25:25.040 --> 25:30.400
in the dialectical process. Right, exactly. It's not as though the truth is ever fully graspable,

25:30.400 --> 25:34.240
but we can get nearer to it through that collaborative process of speaking and

25:34.240 --> 25:38.320
articulating the thoughts. And in fact, even in the act of, like you say, writing or articulating

25:38.320 --> 25:43.360
yourself, with your self-authoring program, for instance, the act of writing things out

25:43.920 --> 25:50.080
is what clarifies the points of view for you. I've actually found that the way that I think

25:50.080 --> 25:54.640
about these issues now is largely a product of the fact that I've written so much about it.

25:55.040 --> 26:00.640
And changed my mind through the act of learning how to express myself on these points. And the

26:00.640 --> 26:07.520
consequence of not having that opportunity, I think, is something I would barely want to

26:07.520 --> 26:14.640
contemplate. And I think to give an example of the moment, which is that because any kind of

26:14.640 --> 26:19.600
attempt to have a discussion or debate about the perceived conflict between trans rights and gender

26:19.600 --> 26:24.560
critical feminism, because to even attempt that discussion at the moment will have such

26:24.560 --> 26:30.640
grave social consequences. And certainly in terms of career prospects, major consequences,

26:30.640 --> 26:35.600
people will not have that discussion. I have people I know in politics, in the media, and they

26:35.600 --> 26:41.200
say to me quite honestly, I will not talk about this. I have concerns, I have qualms, I want answers

26:41.200 --> 26:45.520
to questions, but I absolutely will not open my mouth about this. And if you don't do that,

26:46.240 --> 26:51.120
that this is why no one understands the issue. This is why no one has reached any kind of consensus

26:51.120 --> 26:56.960
on this issue. All we have is a sense in which to have the quote unquote wrong opinion makes you a

26:56.960 --> 27:01.520
pariah. And therefore I better not have that opinion. Well, then that's not a sincerely held

27:01.520 --> 27:07.520
conviction. That's just that's just if the definition of wrong is continually transforming

27:07.520 --> 27:12.240
and in an unpredictable manner, then it's best just to sidestep the issue entirely. And then

27:12.320 --> 27:17.440
that leaves it murky and ill defined and assuming that you believe that thought has any utility.

27:17.440 --> 27:20.400
And so when you're sitting down to write, when I'm sitting down to write,

27:21.120 --> 27:25.760
and I produce a sentence, you know, it might have come from some theoretical perspective,

27:25.760 --> 27:30.640
maybe I'm approaching something from a Freudian perspective or a Marxist perspective or a

27:32.480 --> 27:39.040
enlightenment perspective, etc. I mean, it's a psychological trope, I suppose, that

27:39.840 --> 27:44.880
we all think the thoughts of dead philosophers, right? We think we have our own opinions, but

27:44.880 --> 27:50.160
that's really very, very, very, very rarely the case. It's not that easy to come up with something

27:50.160 --> 27:56.800
truly original and generally make incremental progress at best. And so your ability to abstractly

27:56.800 --> 28:02.880
represent the world and then to generate avatars that can be defeated without you dying is dependent

28:02.880 --> 28:08.640
on your incorporation of a multitude of opinions. And that in itself is a consequence of

28:09.760 --> 28:14.560
I mean, that works to the degree that communication is actually free and that you can get access to

28:14.560 --> 28:20.080
as much thought as you can possibly manage. So I can't see how you can deny the centrality

28:20.880 --> 28:25.360
of free speech as a fundamental right or the fundamental right, perhaps,

28:26.160 --> 28:32.800
unless you simultaneously deny the utility of thought. But maybe if you are also inclined to

28:33.520 --> 28:41.440
remove the individual from the central position of the political discourse, then maybe you can also

28:43.680 --> 28:49.200
make the case at least implicitly that individual thought doesn't matter and that mostly it's just

28:49.200 --> 28:54.400
causing trouble. But I think individual thought is key. And actually, even in the outline you've

28:54.400 --> 29:00.160
described there, there is individual agency in reaching a conclusion that has been articulated

29:00.160 --> 29:04.240
before insofar as if you are engaged with a multitude of writers and philosophers and

29:04.240 --> 29:08.400
artists and ideas and you've come out with a perspective. Well, that perspective may not

29:08.400 --> 29:13.040
be original to you, but the process that you've gone through to reach that viewpoint is individual

29:13.040 --> 29:17.280
to you. There is a power in that. There's something important about that.

29:17.280 --> 29:22.880
No, there's something crucial. If you're a practicing psychotherapist, one of the things

29:22.880 --> 29:30.880
you have to learn is to not provide people with your words too much. What you want is for them

29:30.880 --> 29:36.800
to formulate the conclusion. And you can guide them through the process of investigation. You

29:36.800 --> 29:44.880
talked about the self-authoring process, which is online at selfauthoring.com, that it steps people

29:44.880 --> 29:50.560
say through the process of writing an autobiography, of analyzing their current virtues and faults and

29:51.280 --> 29:58.320
making a future plan. The utility of all of that is dependent on the person who's

29:59.920 --> 30:08.240
undertaking the exercise, generating their own verbal representations. And that seems to cement

30:08.240 --> 30:15.840
it somehow as yours if you've come up with the words. And so it's the uppermost expression of

30:15.840 --> 30:23.200
personhood, the ability to have the words that you should speak reveal themselves to you and to

30:23.200 --> 30:29.200
have the right to express them as you see fit. Yes. In which case, if you are merely repeating

30:29.200 --> 30:34.640
an accepted script, then to what extent can you even say to be an individual at all?

30:36.960 --> 30:43.760
I think that's part of the philosophical conundrum is that if you believe that all people do is repeat

30:43.760 --> 30:50.960
predigested scripts, especially if your view is that the fundamental human motivation is power

30:50.960 --> 30:55.920
and the entire social landscape is nothing but a competition between equally,

30:57.120 --> 31:03.840
what would you say, selfish and single-minded power strivers, then there is no individual.

31:04.480 --> 31:09.920
There's no individual in that conceptual world. And it seems to me that that's the world that

31:10.160 --> 31:20.400
we're being pushed to inhabit and are criticized for on moral grounds for criticizing. And I'm

31:20.400 --> 31:26.960
still trying to get my hands around this. I mean, when I went to Britain, I saw the CTTV cameras

31:26.960 --> 31:33.040
and the increased security, and it isn't clear to me how that's related to the social justice issues

31:33.040 --> 31:38.320
that so-called social justice issues that we're discussing. But they seem to me in some very

31:38.320 --> 31:42.800
difficult to comprehend way, part and parcel of the same thing, the same dangerous thing.

31:43.600 --> 31:47.360
Well, I think it's probably connected just in terms of this distrust of humanity or this

31:47.360 --> 31:54.960
belief that people need to be shepherded, otherwise left to their own devices, chaos will reign.

31:54.960 --> 32:00.640
I think that's the connection. It's not directly connected as far as the issues relating to liberty

32:00.640 --> 32:05.360
and CTTV, obviously predate what we now call whatever the current social justice movement

32:05.360 --> 32:12.560
is called. But I think there is something there. I mean, the censorship, the impulse

32:12.560 --> 32:18.000
to censor what people read, and this is something that particularly hits home to me in the arts,

32:18.880 --> 32:27.280
is based on this view that ultimately the people are or the populace is liable to corruption

32:27.280 --> 32:32.320
if they're exposed to the wrong materials. And what's very interesting to me about that,

32:32.320 --> 32:37.120
I mean, you've written a lot about the way in which literature, for instance, informs our

32:37.120 --> 32:42.560
experiences because it is, in a sense, like when you read philosophers, you're feeling your way

32:42.560 --> 32:47.200
through other lives and other experiences that are trans-historical and cross-cultural,

32:47.200 --> 32:52.400
and they inform the way that you react in your own individual experience. But if you start to say,

32:52.400 --> 32:58.720
as an artist, no, you can only represent for a start what you personally are or have experienced,

32:58.800 --> 33:02.640
and you cannot represent anything which is morally problematic to use the phrase that they

33:02.640 --> 33:09.200
absolutely adore, then art fails to, and literature in particular, fails to function in the way that

33:09.200 --> 33:15.040
it should because you can't explore those things. This is why I often, when it comes to censorship

33:15.040 --> 33:19.520
of the arts, I often go back to what Oscar Wilde said about this. He said, there's no such thing

33:19.520 --> 33:25.600
as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written or badly written. That is all. And that

33:25.600 --> 33:32.480
actually art and morality sometimes are not, in other words, art shouldn't just be about promoting

33:32.480 --> 33:36.560
whatever the ethical trend is of any given time. It's much bigger than that.

33:36.560 --> 33:42.560
Well, it's not art at that point at all. As far as I'm concerned, if you can state the purpose

33:42.560 --> 33:50.960
of the art in explicit terms, especially if it's in accordance with, let's say, an ideology that's

33:51.040 --> 33:55.520
shared by a multitude of people, it's not art at all. It's propaganda.

33:55.520 --> 33:59.360
It's totally banal. I mean, this is why so many people are getting sick of Hollywood,

33:59.360 --> 34:02.640
I mean, to bring it down to a different level, that people are sick of the entertainment on their

34:02.640 --> 34:07.360
TV, on their streaming services, and on Hollywood, because they have this constant feeling that they're

34:07.360 --> 34:12.880
being hectic by some moralistic person in a studio saying, you know, our focus here is on

34:12.880 --> 34:19.120
diversity, our focus here is on the right moral message, that the message of the story is one

34:19.120 --> 34:23.520
that would be approved by a group of intersectional activists, and you get this all the time seeping

34:23.520 --> 34:27.520
into mainstream entertainment, and people get really, really sick of it. It's not that when

34:27.520 --> 34:33.280
you see a lesbian kiss in Star Wars, that that offends you because you're a homophobe, most

34:33.280 --> 34:37.520
sci-fi fans, they've never had a problem with diversity or anything like that. What bothers

34:37.520 --> 34:42.800
them about it is this sense of someone saying to them, we think you're all evil bigots and you

34:42.800 --> 34:47.360
need to be educated, and that's why we're going to shoehorn in a lesbian kiss into the end of this

34:47.360 --> 34:51.520
film. That's why people have a problem. I mean, you had it yourself recently with that ludicrous

34:51.520 --> 34:57.200
Marvel comics thing, where you became the Red Skull, and that to me was a perfect example of the

34:57.200 --> 35:05.200
banality of an artistic endeavor that becomes an exercise in political pedagogy, because that

35:05.200 --> 35:11.280
was quite clearly, I mean, you couldn't even say it was satirical, because it cannot be satirically

35:11.280 --> 35:15.600
effective if the thing that they are comparing you to is the precise opposite of the thing you

35:15.600 --> 35:21.520
believe. I mean, of all the sort of public figures I can think of, you have the most clear track

35:21.520 --> 35:26.080
record of opposing tyranny in all its forms, which anyone who knows anything about your work will

35:26.080 --> 35:31.440
know. You've spent years lecturing about the evils of authoritarianism, including Nazism. So the idea

35:31.440 --> 35:40.640
that you would then become this super magic Nazi is propagandistic. It's totally banal artistically.

35:40.640 --> 35:45.920
Firstly, you can't, it's not satirically, right? But also it's just, it's just, it's just,

35:47.040 --> 35:50.000
do you know what it reminds me of? Actually, I don't know if you, if you remember after the Fatwa

35:50.000 --> 35:56.000
against Salman Rushdie, there was a film made in Pakistan called International Gorillaz,

35:56.000 --> 36:02.880
where they turned Salman Rushdie into this evil villain playboy who was colluding with the

36:02.880 --> 36:08.560
Israeli military services. And at the end of the film, these flying copies of the Quran float down

36:08.560 --> 36:12.560
and shoot laser beams into his head and kill him off. But it, and that is such a ridiculous,

36:12.560 --> 36:17.280
laughable film, you know, you put your enemy as the main villain, and you just misrepresent him

36:17.280 --> 36:20.720
in that way. Well, that's just what they did to you. It's as banal as that. And that's, I think

36:20.720 --> 36:27.120
people are sick of that. Well, the response thankfully seems to indicate that, you know, it

36:27.120 --> 36:32.800
didn't, did people, it didn't do me any harm as far as I can tell. I mean, it was very

36:33.440 --> 36:39.440
shocking to me that it happened. It took me about 12 hours to sort of regain my composure,

36:39.440 --> 36:45.120
because I actually couldn't believe it to begin with. I was sure that it was a fabrication,

36:45.920 --> 36:51.760
especially, but then it was even more shocking when I found out who had authored it. You know,

36:51.760 --> 36:55.760
it wasn't, it was someone who had an intellectual reputation. And so.

36:56.960 --> 37:00.320
But he's an activist, isn't he? He's a, he's an intersectional activist.

37:00.400 --> 37:03.520
He definitely, his opinions definitely place him on the radical,

37:04.080 --> 37:11.360
on the side of the radical left. So it's very difficult to, so there's an attack on

37:13.200 --> 37:20.240
the essence of free speech. I mean, I remember reading Derrida. Derrida criticized our culture,

37:20.240 --> 37:26.240
Western culture as phallogocentric. Yeah. And it's really actually quite a precise word.

37:26.800 --> 37:32.240
So the phallic part of it is masculine, obviously related to the phallus to the,

37:32.960 --> 37:39.280
and logos is, well, that's the central concept of Greek rationalism,

37:39.280 --> 37:43.840
but it's also the central concept of Christianity. And the logos is

37:45.280 --> 37:51.840
something like the magical power of genuine and true speech. It's something like that. And

37:52.640 --> 37:59.680
there are representations of the magical power of speech that predate Greece and Christianity.

37:59.680 --> 38:06.960
You see it in Mesopotamia that this, the equivalent to the savior and ancient Mesopotamian

38:08.080 --> 38:13.760
religious thinking was Marduk and he could speak magic words. He had eyes all the way around his

38:13.760 --> 38:18.560
head, which meant that he paid attention to everything, but he could speak magic words. And

38:19.440 --> 38:29.840
and so that idea of the centrality of speech to the, and its association with the very fabric of

38:29.840 --> 38:36.640
reality, that's been an idea that has strived to make itself manifest for thousands and thousands

38:36.640 --> 38:44.480
of years. I mean, in the Judeo-Christian tradition, in the biblical tradition, the word is given

38:44.480 --> 38:51.760
cosmological status as the thing that brings habitable order out of chaos and it's identified

38:51.760 --> 38:58.880
with divinity itself. And so the assault on free speech is an assault on a principle that's

38:59.840 --> 39:05.120
fundamental beyond, say, its centrality, its central importance to the enlightenment.

39:05.760 --> 39:10.800
And it's an assault on the, on the idea of the logos itself.

39:11.600 --> 39:16.480
I agree. This is why I always mistrusted the, the post-structuralist. So when I was studying

39:16.480 --> 39:20.880
for English, it was the Derrida and Foucault and Lyotard and these were taken as a given and this

39:20.880 --> 39:24.960
idea that there's no, there is no truth beyond language, you know, language is all language,

39:24.960 --> 39:28.400
the way in which we construct our perception of reality and our perception of truth. And

39:28.400 --> 39:31.680
and that actually there is no truth at the heart of it. I just found it so depressing,

39:32.240 --> 39:36.400
depressingly pessimistic because it also means that you construct, can construct any kind of

39:36.400 --> 39:41.600
reality you like and it, and it also. Well, maybe that's part of the motivation for it is

39:43.200 --> 39:50.720
the, the hypothetical lack of constraint by anything that that seems to imply, right? I mean,

39:51.280 --> 39:57.760
if there's no canonical reality, while there's no responsibility, that's for sure. You could

39:57.760 --> 40:01.760
argue that there's no meaning and it's deeply pessimistic, but maybe the payoff for that is no

40:01.760 --> 40:06.000
responsibility, but there's also no constraint of any sort. There's certainly no ethical constraint

40:06.960 --> 40:14.160
and I mean, I keep trying to dig to see what's at the bottom of this, this anti-logo sentiment and

40:15.600 --> 40:21.520
it's a very, it's a very difficult thing to make to get right. Maybe it's not even as deliberate as

40:21.520 --> 40:27.680
the way that it sounds. Maybe it is just the fact that that these theories for whatever reason became

40:27.680 --> 40:31.760
fashionable in universities about 20 years ago and now for whatever reason they have

40:31.920 --> 40:36.800
escaped into the mainstream and, and you know, I mean, most of the people that push this stuff

40:37.360 --> 40:42.960
don't read Foucault and they don't know about the people whose ideas they've, they've imbibed and

40:42.960 --> 40:46.880
actually very much misunderstood. You know, I mean, the whole point of the postmodernist was to,

40:46.880 --> 40:52.560
to, to, to trash the notion of grand narratives and what we have now in the social justice movement

40:52.560 --> 40:56.480
is an incredible grand narrative. You know, we are, we are on the right side of history. We are the

40:56.480 --> 41:02.000
righteous ones and everyone else needs to be, you know, decimated and it's, it's, it seems to me

41:03.200 --> 41:07.200
that this stuff, I don't think it's as conspiratorial as that. I think it's just sort of

41:08.000 --> 41:12.000
circumstances of history, one thing after another and this is where we're at now,

41:12.000 --> 41:16.400
but the end result that we have to deal with, which I think you've alluded to is this idea

41:16.400 --> 41:21.440
that if there is no such thing as reality beyond language, then you are at liberty to, to construct

41:21.440 --> 41:29.280
whatever a pseudo reality that you desire or is easiest for you. And we see elements of this

41:29.280 --> 41:33.520
reverberating, I think in a lot of the discourse at the moment of things like lived experience,

41:33.520 --> 41:38.400
you know, you can present as much data as you want, but it will be disregarded if it doesn't

41:38.400 --> 41:43.120
tally with what lived experience really means, which is what I want to be true. Well, there's

41:43.120 --> 41:49.280
also this insistence that seems part of it that, I mean, I objected to some legislation that was

41:49.280 --> 41:55.280
passed in Canada and that's sort of what propelled me into public visibility, let's say.

41:56.080 --> 42:03.200
And to begin with, I was mostly concentrating on the violation of the principle of free speech

42:03.200 --> 42:09.520
that the legislation seemed to me to represent because it compelled certain utterances and

42:09.520 --> 42:15.760
I was never a fan of hate speech laws to begin with. And, and this was something beyond hate

42:15.760 --> 42:21.600
speech laws because hate speech laws stop you from saying things, whereas compelled speech laws

42:21.600 --> 42:26.480
force you to say something which is much worse, even though the first one is also

42:27.040 --> 42:33.760
inadvised, ill-advised as far as I'm concerned. But I've realized more recently that I was also

42:33.760 --> 42:40.560
disturbed, although in a less explicit manner, with the theory of identity that was an implicit

42:40.640 --> 42:47.360
part of the legislation. So with gender identity, for example, and we're engaged in a discussion

42:47.360 --> 42:52.720
across our culture about gender identity, I mean, I know as a personality psychologist that

42:54.880 --> 43:00.080
there are females, biological females who have masculine personalities and there are

43:00.080 --> 43:05.680
biological males who have feminine personalities, that the link between personality as such and,

43:06.640 --> 43:14.320
biological structure is suggestive, but not absolute. And there's a lot of variability.

43:16.080 --> 43:23.120
But the idea that identity is something that you define yourself and that you can change

43:24.320 --> 43:32.720
at will at any point seems to me to be entirely counterproductive and dangerous because it's

43:32.720 --> 43:40.880
inaccurate. So your identity isn't merely your membership in whatever group you happen to identify

43:40.880 --> 43:46.000
with at that moment. It's certainly not merely your sexuality or merely your race. In fact,

43:46.640 --> 43:51.440
your identity is barely your race because your identity is something more like

43:52.640 --> 44:00.000
how you conduct yourself in the world. And if you define yourself as black, let's say,

44:00.720 --> 44:08.000
that doesn't give you much of a map to encountering and approaching the world. It's nowhere near

44:08.000 --> 44:17.680
detailed enough. And then the idea that you define it, I've been thinking about that a lot,

44:19.200 --> 44:25.520
you never define your identity by yourself. You can't because you're surrounded by other people

44:25.520 --> 44:31.600
and they have to play along with you. And if they don't play along with you voluntarily,

44:31.600 --> 44:37.440
which means they appreciate the quality of your game and they understand it, then you're either

44:37.440 --> 44:43.200
going to be alienated or you have to impose your identity by force. But that's also not a very good

44:43.200 --> 44:49.040
solution. I mean, I just spent some time interviewing one of the world's foremost authorities on

44:49.040 --> 44:54.640
aggression and that'll be released in a bit. Perhaps it's been released before this will be

44:54.640 --> 45:02.960
released. He's done longitudinal studies of aggression. And if the idea that our social

45:02.960 --> 45:10.240
structures are predicated on power was true, then children would start out not being aggressive and

45:10.240 --> 45:14.400
they would become more aggressive with time. And the more aggressive children would be more

45:14.400 --> 45:21.600
successful. And none of that is true. Children start out more aggressive than they are on average

45:21.600 --> 45:27.200
by the time their adults. Aggression levels decrease with age rather than increasing. And

45:27.200 --> 45:34.160
there's no evidence whatsoever that it's a useful long term strategy in the social world.

45:34.960 --> 45:41.280
Identity is something you negotiate the way you negotiate a game. It has to be that way.

45:42.560 --> 45:46.160
There's something rather sinister, isn't there, about the way in which present day identity

45:46.160 --> 45:53.840
politics is about imposition onto others, rather than an assertion of who I am or whatever that

45:53.840 --> 46:00.000
might be. I mean, I always mistrusted it. And so I can see the utility of identity politics,

46:00.000 --> 46:04.880
politically speaking, in scenarios where people are marginalized. You know, I understand why gay

46:04.880 --> 46:09.920
people collectively came together back in the 60s to fight for their rights, because there was

46:09.920 --> 46:13.840
obviously a serious problem or the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland in the 60s and 70s

46:13.840 --> 46:18.160
and that kind of thing, where Catholics weren't able to have the vote or to get housing. So that

46:18.160 --> 46:23.760
sort of makes sense to me. The current identity politics are what we might call identitarians.

46:23.760 --> 46:29.680
A lot of it strikes me as about power. In fact, I feel like they would be an incredible subject

46:29.680 --> 46:35.120
for Foucault if he were alive today, because I've noticed this correlation and a lot of people have

46:35.120 --> 46:39.520
noticed this correlation. And I never get an answer about this. But why is it whenever online,

46:39.600 --> 46:43.440
whenever I'm viciously attacked or threatened, something particularly pernicious,

46:44.240 --> 46:51.280
the person doing it always has their pronouns in their bio or a rainbow gay flag in their bio.

46:51.280 --> 46:55.600
Why is there a correlation that I've experienced again and again? I mean, it's almost inevitable

46:55.600 --> 47:04.080
at this point, between the need to self identify in terms of sexuality and gender, and a kind of

47:04.160 --> 47:08.000
cruelty or viciousness or a need to attack an aggression.

47:08.000 --> 47:15.600
Well, one of the things that disturbs me constantly about ideological representations of

47:16.800 --> 47:23.200
the world, broadly speaking, is that their fundamental danger is that they always contain

47:23.200 --> 47:31.200
a too convenient theory of evil and malevolence. And for me, any theory that locates the fundamental

47:31.200 --> 47:38.480
problem of evil somewhere other than inside you is dangerous. Now, that isn't to say that

47:39.520 --> 47:45.760
social structures can't be corrupted and aren't corrupt. That's an existential problem in and

47:45.760 --> 47:50.720
of itself. It's always the case that our social institutions aren't what they should be and

47:50.720 --> 47:55.920
they're outdated and they're predicated to some degree on deceit. And people who use power can

47:55.920 --> 48:02.000
manipulate them sometimes successfully. That problem never goes away and it never will. But

48:04.480 --> 48:12.320
when the evil can be easily located somewhere else, then you have every moral right to allow your

48:12.320 --> 48:19.040
unexamined motivations to manifest themselves fully because you can punish the evildoers and

48:19.040 --> 48:23.440
always remain on the moral side of the fence. There's a huge attractiveness in that.

48:24.160 --> 48:28.000
I think, I mean, this is something you've explored a lot with the idea of the Solzhenitsyn's

48:28.000 --> 48:34.080
idea about the good and evil cutting through the heart of every human being. Because that, to me,

48:35.840 --> 48:39.840
it really gets to the heart of a lot of what I would call a kind of infantile culture. I think

48:39.840 --> 48:47.760
this is a symptom of childishness. Whenever I was learning about literature and what

48:47.760 --> 48:52.320
constituted more sophisticated literature and what didn't, Disney films, childish films,

48:52.320 --> 48:56.960
let's take Tolkien, for instance, good people look, sorry, bad people look bad, they look like

48:56.960 --> 49:00.800
orcs, they're ugly, and they are villains, and then there are heroes and they are good,

49:00.800 --> 49:05.760
there isn't complexity. And if you have a more complex novel, like a Mervyn Peake novel where

49:05.760 --> 49:09.280
people aren't necessarily good or bad, they're both, they struggle within themselves and with

49:09.280 --> 49:14.480
other people, that is a mark of a kind of adult novel as opposed to a childish novel, right? And

49:14.480 --> 49:18.640
that's quite an important distinction. And I think most of the political and ideological battles

49:18.640 --> 49:22.640
that I find myself in the middle of, and I'm sure you do as well, are because people are just

49:22.640 --> 49:28.080
reducing everything to this binary of good versus evil and putting themselves on the side of good.

49:28.880 --> 49:37.600
It is a very infantile, almost like a caricature of religion. And I see it again and again,

49:37.600 --> 49:41.600
we had it in this country with the Brexit vote, effectively, what happened in the vote here.

49:41.600 --> 49:46.080
And the reason why it became so toxic and families fell apart, and you wouldn't believe,

49:46.080 --> 49:50.080
I know it wasn't reported very much elsewhere, but it was like a kind of ideological civil war

49:50.080 --> 49:54.400
here, but not a very sophisticated one, because it came down to this narrative that if you voted

49:54.400 --> 49:59.840
to leave the EU, you were evil, racist, stupid. And if you voted to remain, you were good and

49:59.840 --> 50:04.400
progressive, and all the rest and noble and virtuous, right? And of course, there are all

50:04.400 --> 50:10.000
sorts of good reasons to have voted either way. And this kind of caricature, and it happens again

50:10.080 --> 50:16.960
with... Well, you described it as a caricature of religion. And I think that's what an ideology is.

50:17.520 --> 50:25.600
And this is one of the reasons that I've been inclined, let's say, to go to have my shot at the

50:25.600 --> 50:31.600
rational atheists, much as I'm a fan of enlightenment thinking. I mean, I was convinced,

50:31.600 --> 50:38.000
as a consequence of reading Jung primarily, but also Dostoevsky and also Nietzsche primarily,

50:38.000 --> 50:45.520
and Solzhenitsyn, I would say, as well, that... And then biology as well, as I studied that more

50:45.520 --> 50:57.200
deeply. There's no escaping a religious framework. There's no way out of it. And if you eliminate it,

50:57.840 --> 51:04.160
say, as a consequence of rational criticism, what you inevitably produce is its replacement by

51:04.960 --> 51:07.840
forms of religion that are much less sophisticated. I mean...

51:09.360 --> 51:14.720
Well, it's not religion. It's a fundamentalist religion. You know, if I look back to my Catholic

51:14.720 --> 51:20.160
upbringing, actually acknowledging your own capacity for sin is at the heart of Catholicism.

51:20.160 --> 51:24.080
That's why we have the confessional. That's why you sit there and tell this stranger all these

51:24.080 --> 51:31.760
things you've done wrong. Because it's reckoning with it. Well, that's far from trivial. It's

51:31.760 --> 51:37.680
unbelievably not trivial. And because it was so common, like a common part of Catholicism,

51:37.680 --> 51:45.360
it can be passed over without notice. And so the religious structures that we inherited,

51:45.360 --> 51:49.840
I'm going to talk about Christianity most specifically, because it's the dominant form of...

51:50.800 --> 51:56.000
It's the form of religious belief that primarily undergirds our social structures.

51:56.000 --> 52:00.960
It's our operating system. My producer came up with that term the other day, and I thought it was

52:00.960 --> 52:10.000
apt. And it does localize the drama between good and evil inside and makes you responsible for that

52:11.360 --> 52:18.400
and encourages you, let's say, to attend to the ways that you fall short of the ideal. And

52:19.280 --> 52:24.320
when you criticize a structure like that out of existence, you don't criticize the questions that

52:24.320 --> 52:31.280
gave rise to it out of existence. And the questions might be, well, what's the nature of the good?

52:31.280 --> 52:35.440
What's the nature of evil? Those are religious questions. What's the purpose of our life?

52:36.720 --> 52:41.920
How do you orient yourself if you're trying to move up, let's say, rather than down?

52:42.960 --> 52:47.440
How should you conduct yourself, et cetera, et cetera? Those questions don't go away.

52:47.680 --> 52:55.440
They can't not be answered. And so the way that a traditional religious structure answers them is,

52:56.080 --> 53:01.920
in a mysterious way, it uses ritual, it uses music, it uses art, it uses literature, it uses

53:01.920 --> 53:07.200
stories, all these things that are outside the realm of easy criticism. And then some of that's

53:07.200 --> 53:13.680
translated into comprehensible, explicit dogma, and that's the part that's most susceptible to

53:13.680 --> 53:19.600
rational criticism. But when that disappears, I've been thinking about this a lot this week,

53:19.600 --> 53:25.280
because of what happened to Richard Dawkins recently. And I have my differences with Dawkins

53:25.280 --> 53:30.480
and the rest of the rational atheists, because I think that they underestimated the danger of

53:30.480 --> 53:37.200
dispensing with what they were attempting to dispense with. And I see the influx of religious

53:37.200 --> 53:44.240
fervor associated with political ideas as a direct consequence of the lack of separation,

53:44.240 --> 53:47.760
let's say, between church and state, psychologically.

53:47.760 --> 53:54.240
But Dawkins has fallen foul of this new religion, but his case actually really is

53:54.960 --> 53:58.880
testimony to what we're talking about, that this is not a religion in a traditional sense,

53:58.880 --> 54:02.880
it is an infantile religion that only sees things in binaries of good and evil, because

54:02.960 --> 54:08.960
he was effectively, he was posing a question about identity. He was saying, if it is possible for

54:08.960 --> 54:15.600
Rachel Dollazal to identify as black, why is she universally condemned and derided,

54:15.600 --> 54:20.400
but somebody can identify as the opposite sex, and they are celebrated. And all he was doing

54:20.400 --> 54:24.880
was posing the question, he wasn't even actually making a claim.

54:24.880 --> 54:28.960
Yeah, well, he was doing, he was doing what a scientist actually does. I mean, I've been shocked

54:29.920 --> 54:35.360
frequently in my interactions with journalists, because I've worked as a scientist for three

54:35.360 --> 54:40.320
decades, and I'm accustomed to the way that scientists think and speak. And when I'm sitting

54:40.320 --> 54:45.840
around with my graduate students, and there's a problem or an issue, what they do, and my colleagues

54:45.840 --> 54:50.880
as well, is generate a bunch of hypotheses about why that might be. They don't necessarily believe

54:50.880 --> 54:58.000
them, but the first trick is to generate as many, what would you say, hypotheses, I said that already,

54:58.080 --> 55:02.240
that might account for it, ranging from biological through social, etc.

55:02.240 --> 55:06.400
And that is exactly what Dawkins did. He even said that's what he was doing.

55:06.400 --> 55:11.200
That puts you on the side of the devil. I mean, there was a viral tweet this week from a teacher

55:11.200 --> 55:15.440
saying, I will never allow my pupils to play devil's advocate. I will never allow that in the

55:15.440 --> 55:19.600
class, because some views are oppressive and are not to be entertained. I mean,

55:20.560 --> 55:24.000
but that's the point. That's why the Vatican will call in a devil's advocate when someone is

55:24.000 --> 55:28.560
potentially being canonized. Well, if you can't play devil's advocate, you can't think.

55:29.440 --> 55:35.440
You have to have a devil's advocate in your head. If you don't have a devil's advocate in your head

55:35.440 --> 55:40.080
torturing every thought you generate, you're not engaged in critical thinking.

55:40.080 --> 55:44.880
Right. That's the scientific process to disprove yourself. I mean, that's what surprises me about

55:45.840 --> 55:51.120
Richard Dawkins' response, because I think what he didn't realize is that he was caught in this

55:51.120 --> 55:57.680
good versus evil binary, and he was the heretic now. He had been branded. He posed the question,

55:57.680 --> 56:05.040
you're not meant to pose. And therefore, he's now outed himself as one of the demons. He's

56:05.040 --> 56:10.480
there in pandemonium with the other demons. Now, so then he, of course, backtracked and

56:10.480 --> 56:16.080
apologized and said, well, I didn't want to offend anyone. And of course, in an adult

56:16.160 --> 56:21.840
rational world, that would be taken in good faith. And I don't think he fully appreciates

56:21.840 --> 56:26.320
what's going on here, is that he's already marked himself as the sinner.

56:26.320 --> 56:31.600
Well, here's his apology, let's say. Now, what he should have said, as far as I'm concerned,

56:31.600 --> 56:41.520
here's what he said. I do not intend to disparage trans people. I see that my academic

56:41.520 --> 56:48.080
disgust question has been misconstrued as such, and I deplore this. It was also not my attempt to

56:48.080 --> 56:55.440
ally in any way with Republican bigots in the US now exploiting this issue. And so it's so interesting

56:55.440 --> 57:01.280
that that's what he did, because- Well, it's buying into the tribalism thing. You know-

57:01.280 --> 57:09.840
Well, it's also, it's not the best response to defend him. What he should have said was something

57:09.840 --> 57:17.840
like, look, people, here's something to think about that I was posing. That's what scientists do.

57:18.400 --> 57:23.840
And you didn't understand that, but that's not my problem. It's your lack of sophistication. But

57:25.120 --> 57:32.400
instead of saying that, he immediately removed himself from the bad people, and that was the

57:32.400 --> 57:40.240
Republican bigots, which just seems to me to pour fuel on the fire. And then he also said

57:40.800 --> 57:45.840
that he didn't intend to disparage trans people, which isn't the issue at all.

57:45.840 --> 57:50.000
Well, also, there was no implication in what he asked that he had ever intended to disparage

57:50.000 --> 57:53.920
trans people. But to be fair to him, to be fair to him, I understand when you're caught in the

57:53.920 --> 57:58.080
middle of a Twitter storm, you just want it to stop. And I've heard you talk about this as well,

57:58.080 --> 58:02.640
is actually your response probably isn't going to be the best one. You just wanted to go away.

58:02.640 --> 58:06.640
No, well, look, I mean, one of the things that's really worth pointing out here, and it's not

58:06.640 --> 58:11.120
like I don't have sympathy for Dawkins. I have sympathy for Dawkins. I sent out a tweet defending

58:11.120 --> 58:16.320
him yesterday. I mean, Dawkins is an admirable scientist. In my estimation, I learned lots from

58:16.320 --> 58:23.840
reading his books. That doesn't mean I don't have my criticisms of Dawkins. But just because you have

58:23.840 --> 58:28.560
criticisms of someone doesn't mean that they've never done anything worthwhile or that you haven't

58:28.560 --> 58:32.400
learned something from them. And that's especially true in the scientific realm.

58:39.920 --> 58:46.000
I just don't understand why. Okay, so back to the Twitter issue. So what I've seen repeatedly,

58:46.000 --> 58:51.760
and this is worth some discussion, is when I'm watching Twitter, when I'm watching these attacks

58:51.840 --> 58:58.080
on people, what I've seen the most general pattern of response to be is that it doesn't take very

58:58.080 --> 59:03.600
many people attacking you on Twitter before it's seriously psychologically disturbing.

59:04.880 --> 59:09.200
And that is interestingly related to this whole issue of hate speech that we've been discussing,

59:09.200 --> 59:14.800
because it is the case that vicious attacks have quite a pronounced psychological effect,

59:14.800 --> 59:20.880
especially if they're personal. And people generally fold and apologize instantly if my

59:20.880 --> 59:26.400
sense is being if the Twitter mob is 20 people. It's sort of like they're reacting to 20 of their

59:26.400 --> 59:33.280
neighbors showing up on their doorsteps with pitchforks and torches. And I think it's actually

59:33.280 --> 59:40.400
an admirable response in some sense, because a well-socialized person actually does care what

59:40.400 --> 59:46.880
their neighbors think. And if you offend 20 of your neighbors, it's possible 20 of your tribe,

59:46.960 --> 59:50.960
it's possible that you've done something wrong. You might ask yourself that. Now, on Twitter,

59:50.960 --> 59:55.600
you're connected to hundreds of thousands of people. And if you would offend 20,

59:56.160 --> 01:00:00.080
it's not clear what that means. It might just mean that you said something.

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:04.320
It feels a lot worse than it actually is as well. It feels amplified, because there's all these people

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:08.320
who are strangers who know absolutely nothing about you. And it's particularly frustrating,

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:13.200
because more often than not, when it's happened to me, it's always been an imagined grievance.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:17.040
It's not actually something I've said, it's something that they've assumed that I've said,

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:21.520
or a way that they have interpreted this. And the more you try and fight back against it,

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:26.880
or try and explain your actual position, the more they double down on their, and you've had this

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:30.320
as well, people are going after a figment of their own imagination, that's impossible to fend off.

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:35.520
And it does do psychological harm. And I've never denied that. And this is something I

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:39.600
addressed in the book, because I quoted, I can't remember her name now, but a writer talking about

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:46.000
how hate speech could be said to be violence, insofar as the psychological impact can have,

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.400
it can have a physiological impact, it can make you sick, it can make you unwell, the impact of

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:56.800
words. But of course, the example I use is taxation, I could fall physically sick, because I'm

01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:00.000
under stress from being overly taxed by the government. Does that mean that the government

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000
has committed an act of violence against me? It could be applied to absolutely anything, I think.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.800
Well, an anarchist would argue yes.

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:11.840
Right, sure, exactly. But that wouldn't be me. But you could apply that to absolutely any

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:16.880
conceivable scenario, where anything that has happened to you has led to stress and physical

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:20.880
degeneration. And so I don't think it's right to single speech out and say,

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:25.680
speech is, but we can say that that's fine. Well, also, it's a one-sided argument, because

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:31.440
dangerous as speech, free speech is, we don't ever have to deny that there's such a thing as

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:37.600
hateful speech or damaging speech or corrosive speech or untruth speech or pathological speech

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:44.560
in every possible direction. That isn't the issue. The issue is, what's more dangerous to

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:50.400
regulate it or to leave it be, despite its dangers? That's the only rational argument,

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:55.600
or the only complete argument, let's say. Even if you have the most repugnant character who is

01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:00.880
advocating the most vile ideas about society and attempting to proselytise even someone who's

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:06.480
attempting to recruit people to his or her cause, even something as vicious as neo-Naziism or something

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:11.120
like that, the question isn't, do I support what that person is saying? Because obviously,

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:18.080
we don't. The question is, do you take a few instances of people behaving in this way and use

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:23.280
that as a reason, a justification to empower the state to make a decision about what people

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:28.400
can say and think? That's the bigger principle that's at stake here. I worry that with social

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:32.800
media and Twitter as well, is that we end up buying into the illusion that there are more

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:37.280
hateful people in the world than there actually are, because even the people who send these hateful

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:41.680
things probably wouldn't behave like that in real life. There's something about the online world,

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:46.640
and what it does is absolutely, I mean, this is the heart of cancel culture. This is why it works.

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:50.800
Like you said, it's just a few tweets. That's all it takes. I've seen situations where companies

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:56.480
and corporations will backtrack on a policy just because of one or two tweets, because they fear

01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:04.480
this deluge of people. It has such disproportionate power, and often with this kind of

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:09.280
cancel culture, it is often about something that someone hasn't even said. The example of Dawkins

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:14.000
is perfect, because a lot of the people and some prominent people I saw were saying, look,

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:19.600
Dawkins is now outed himself as a transphobe. If you said to them, where is the transphobic thing?

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:24.560
You him today, you tomorrow, buckle. Well, quite, because if someone is transphobic,

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:30.480
simply because you've decided that. It was the same with JK Rowling. It became suddenly

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:36.400
quite normal for commentators on the mainstream media to say that she has said transphobic things.

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:42.080
Well, where? Because I've read her comments and her essay on the trans issue that she posted on

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:47.840
her blog, and it was a long essay, which was very compassionate and nuanced, and at no point,

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:51.680
it's the opposite. She says that she supports trans rights, and she would stand there against

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.680
any discrimination. And I've been in these fights all the time. If ever you ask someone to say,

01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:01.680
can you just quote the transphobic thing that she said, they never can? And an adult would say,

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:05.600
okay, I can't find the evidence of my preconception, so therefore I should revise

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:11.120
my view. But they don't. They double down on it, and they find these sort of, they use

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:18.080
casuistry and whatever linguistic semantic tricks they can to come background to the

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:22.320
conclusion they'd already decided. Same with Dawkins. I mean, not just the American Humanist

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:26.640
Association. I saw a major blogger saying that anyone who was defending him is transphobic.

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:31.440
And like, well, if that's all it takes to be smeared in this way, if it doesn't matter what you

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:36.240
say, if all that matters is what people decide that you believe, then I suppose this goes back

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:40.480
to this pseudo reality we were discussing. Well, I guess what Dawkins got in trouble for,

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:46.400
let's take it apart a bit, okay? Because it's worth doing. He said, this is his original tweet,

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:55.840
in 2015, Rachel Dolezal, a white chapter president of NAACP, was vilified for identifying as black.

01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:04.160
Some men choose to identify as women, and some women choose to identify as men. You will be

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:10.880
vilified if you deny that they literally are what they identify as. Discuss. Okay, so we put

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:20.480
forth a set of propositions, but the proposition has a point. And the point is, what is it that you

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:30.960
can and can't identify with? And what power do people have to enforce their decision on others?

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:36.880
And that's really the question he's asking if you strip it down. And that is actually a question

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:41.600
that's very threatening to, well, let's see, who would it be threatening to? Well, it would be

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:48.640
threatening to anyone who insists that you can choose an identity, say, in the realm of gender,

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:54.400
and that you should have the right to enforce your choice, despite other people's opinions,

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:59.280
let's say. So he's asking, why is there an inherent contradiction in the intersectional

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:07.200
discourse? Why is it that racial identity is not malleable, and in fact has to be strictly

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:12.960
policed? Hence why we have all these debates about cultural appropriation. Why is that so rigid?

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:17.040
And yet, even if the lived experience, let's go back to that, the lived experience of the person

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:22.240
tells them otherwise. I mean, Rachel Dollazelle wrote a whole book in which she outlines how she

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:27.120
feels that she has always been black. It isn't just, I choose to be black one day, it is something

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:33.120
her lived experience is that, in essence, she is. So why is that to be vilified universally

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:38.080
without question and there's no discussion to be had here? And yet, someone who chooses,

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:45.120
you know, that gender identity is something that is malleable and open to options and actually

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:49.520
infinite options. Why? And I think there is a contradiction. Well, maybe he's vilified because

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:54.560
he asked a question that's at the heart of the problem with identity politics, period. I mean,

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:58.160
particularly because when it comes to race, I mean, virtually all intersectionists would accept

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:01.920
that race is socially constructed. This is something they're always talking about. And so

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:07.520
therefore, in a sense, there is more of a case for transracialism. If you want to say that it is

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:12.480
an identity that can be mixed. Well, in some sense, we already accept transracialism as a given. And

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:23.120
so here's something I might as well get in trouble for this. Well, if your ancestry is 95% Caucasian

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:33.440
and 5% non Caucasian Asian black, let's say, you're not Caucasian. Generally speaking, you can

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:37.680
identify with the minority group. And so at some point, the question becomes, well,

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:44.240
it's a ridiculous question, which is why the whole notion of group identity construed in this way

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:52.240
is so pathological. But we obviously accept some degree of transracial identification if

01:07:53.840 --> 01:08:00.400
your racial group is disproportionately in one category, but you identify with the other,

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:04.160
and that's instantly not only accepted, it's standard practice.

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:08.720
Right. And I'm with the intersectionists on this. And so far as race, we're all the same. You know,

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:12.880
at ever since we've broken down the human genome, we know there are no differences between us. So

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:20.320
this idea that it must be so rigidly policed, this social construct, these arbitrary ideas,

01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:25.120
and yet gender, I mean, I think it's something. Okay, so now we know why now we know exactly why

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:29.680
Dawkins got himself in so much trouble. Well, okay, you know, put his finger. Well, it will,

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:35.360
for sure, for sure. But magical super Nazis are always in trouble. So you know, exactly. But

01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:42.240
then with the question of the gender identity debate, but this is the debate we need to be

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:47.120
having is actually the other thing he put his finger on there is that actually people are arguing

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:53.200
with different definitions in their heads, you know, for the identitarians, the idea of a woman,

01:08:54.080 --> 01:09:00.480
a woman is an identity, it isn't a biological reality. But for most people, the classification

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:06.320
of woman is biological reality, not identity. So in other words, and why is it that we cannot

01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:10.240
have that discussion? So okay, so you believe this thing, we believe the other. And that's why

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:14.800
we're at loggerheads. But let's let's have the discussion. Why can that not happen? Why does it

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:19.360
have to be if you've decided? Well, that's what we're that's actually what we're trying to unpack

01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:23.920
is what's the motivation at the root of this. And it seems to me, I do believe it's something like

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:29.520
a pronounced infantilism. I mean, one of the things I've been toying with is the idea that

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:41.360
the the gender that the demand for gender fluidity in late adolescence, let's say,

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:48.080
is something like the consequence of insufficient fantasy play in childhood.

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:57.760
That that I remember, for example, when my son was little, his sister and her friends

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:03.200
used to dress him up as a fairy princess. They did this with some regularity. And I kind of cast

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:07.680
a dim eye on that. But I thought it through. And, you know, it sort of disturbed me. And then I

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:12.800
thought it through. And I thought, wait a second here, leave the kid alone, leave the girls alone.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:19.120
He is playing out what it means to be female in dramatic play. And he needs to do that because

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:24.240
otherwise he can't understand what it means to be female. That's how children understand,

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:29.600
that's how adults understand things. For God's sake, we go to a movie and we watch someone play

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:34.880
out of female and we identify with that because otherwise we wouldn't be enjoying the movie and

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:40.480
we get we get a bit of a clue about what it's like to inhabit someone else's skin. So there's

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:48.080
this necessity for play in gender roles and that has to manifest itself. And if the play has been

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:55.280
interrupted, let's say by electronic equipment, for example, or any of the other things that

01:10:55.280 --> 01:11:00.640
might be interrupting it, well, maybe that desire comes back with a vengeance later. And I have to

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:06.160
be whoever I say I am. I have to be able to play with this. And well, if it's a developmental

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:11.600
requirement, there's going to be a lot of insistence behind it. And it looks immature and it is because

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:15.680
it should have happened earlier. Most people stabilize their gender identity by the time

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:23.120
they're three or four. But it doesn't always happen. So there is an infantilism in this demand

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:29.360
for fluidity of identity, this insistence that other people play the game that I insist they're

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:34.000
going to play. And then what about the idea that the gender critical feminists would come in and say,

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.920
well, the idea of a boy dressing up in a dress, there's nothing inherently female about that or

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:44.880
feminine about that in any case that all of this is a construct anyway. And why can't we let the

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:48.960
kids just some kids are not gender conforming and they can just do what they want. I mean,

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:56.640
the concern I have with the current identity obsessed ideology is that they see a boy in a dress

01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:04.000
and they will say, well, he could potentially be a woman. And by doing so are reinforcing the most

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:12.800
conservative views of gender to begin with. And that to me, I'm intuitively against that because

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:18.160
I wasn't a gender conforming. I didn't play football with the other boys. I didn't dress up in

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:26.080
dresses, but I may have done if they were lying around. I find it very odd that this supposedly

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:33.760
progressive radical movement is so dependent on the idea of very, very traditional unyielding

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:37.040
notions of what it is to be male and what it is to be female.

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:47.440
Yeah, but only in the case where the identity is across the sex. So you can be, if you're a man

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:53.120
who believes he's a woman, that's inviolable and has a biological reference point. But if you're

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:58.720
a woman who thinks she's a woman, it doesn't. It's completely malleable. And so that's an

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:04.080
inherent contradiction again. And it's worthy of discussion, surely. And the contradiction

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:08.640
doesn't just go away because you won't allow the conversation to happen, which is a contradiction

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:14.880
gets played out in in actuality if you don't allow it to be dealt with in abstraction.

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:20.160
So then the question is, how do we break through? And I mean, this is something I've been

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:26.240
really, really thinking about is that it isn't no, it's no longer just a matter of trying to

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:32.000
persuade people. It's almost trying to de-radicalize people at this point. How do I explain to

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.680
someone the world isn't this fantasy world that you've created in your head, where it's just

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:40.240
it's full of transphones and neo-Nazis and all these and good versus evil. The world is actually

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:44.720
much more complex and nuanced and requires discussion and thought. How do you break through

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:48.800
someone's fantasy so that we can have that discussion? Well, it used to be that you sent

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:53.360
them to the university so they could study humanities. That's the last thing you should do

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:58.240
now. Well, that was the answer. I mean, that was the whole point, right, to to make people more

01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:04.640
sophisticated in their conceptions. And in which cases, is it the case that it's over now? If people

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:11.120
were to be educated out of those problems and now that actually the higher education itself has

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:15.200
become so ideologically driven that to go to university means you end up more indoctrinated

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:19.520
than when you went there. What hope is there? I feel like I'm, I sound a bit frustrated here,

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:23.920
but I feel like I'm bashing my head against a brick wall because half, most of the time when

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.800
I'm caught in an argument with these ideologues, they are arguing, like I say, with a monster

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:31.920
they've created in their own heads. I'm not the person they think I am. I don't have the values

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:36.640
they think I have. And therefore, the discussion is stymied from the outset. And it does make me

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:41.600
very frustrated. And that's probably the real reason I wrote the book, actually, because I want

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:45.520
I want the idea of free speech to be elevated again as a sacrosanct principle,

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:49.120
so that we can have these conversations and so that people don't get demonized and

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:54.480
attacked for things they don't believe. And so that we can reach some kind of consensus

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:58.320
on these issues that we've been describing, these contentious issues, because when you have an issue

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:02.240
that's particularly tendentious, you, it requires more conversation, it requires more discussion

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:05.440
and more understanding. And I don't think we're getting that at the moment.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.800
Yeah, well, I guess I'm somewhat optimistic about that, because I can see all the possibility that

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:16.400
long form conversations of this sort bring.

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:20.960
Well, there's an appetite for them, isn't there? But is there an appetite for them

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:25.920
from the activists and the ideologues who have seen so much control in our major educational

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:26.920
cultural institutions?

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:33.600
Yeah, I think so. I think so. I think so. I mean, I've been struck by how deep the hunger

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:39.200
how deep the hunger is for for genuine conversation and very much heartened by it.

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:42.720
And so that's a counter movement.

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:48.240
I hope you're right. I just don't see any evidence of that from the people I'm talking about. I

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:51.600
don't see it from the people who will say to educate yourself.

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:56.000
It's another problem too, though, isn't it with Twitter, for example, is that it's never the same

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:02.880
people. And that plays with us psychologically, because of course, we are built to more or less

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:09.920
assume that we're interacting with a continuous community. And we aren't. We're interacting

01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:16.160
with a discontinuous community on Twitter. And so we're led astray in our presuppositions constantly.

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:22.160
But it's worse than that. Because it isn't... I know it's different people all the time,

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:25.760
but they all have the same views on absolutely everything. It feels like you're arguing with

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:30.000
the Borg. It feels like just one mind speaking through many, many voices.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.920
Yes, well, it is. Then that's the hallmark of an ideology. It is precisely that.

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:39.600
Then I guess it's a matter of it's certainly and it's a matter of trying to understand the

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:43.200
ideology ever more deeply to see what it's actually focused on.

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:47.600
But I do read their books and I do read their articles and I do try to understand.

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:51.760
I don't believe the people I'm talking about return the favor. They always use the phrase

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:58.080
educate yourself. And what they mean by that is read these select books and digest them uncritically.

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:03.280
That's what they mean by educate yourself. They don't mean read widely and tackle the

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:07.360
various views and come to a conclusion yourself. The last thing they want is critical thought.

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:11.600
Critical thought is the enemy. Ironically, it's the enemy of critical theory.

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:15.360
No, it's a hallmark of white supremacy culture as far as I can see, right?

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:17.360
That's what they say. But that's what they claim.

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:22.800
It's amazing too to see that set of ideas propagate itself across the culture so quickly.

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:28.480
The Canadian federal government in its diversity, inclusivity and equity training program

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:35.040
now uses those concepts like associating white supremacy with punctuality, for example.

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:40.880
They use those in the training of their civil servants. It's been accepted wholeheartedly to

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:45.120
that degree. I've seen them. I've seen the screenshots that often get leaked of these

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:50.240
training sessions and it bullet pointed hallmarks of white supremacy, punctuality,

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:52.560
politeness, hard work. Perfectionism.

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:57.360
Yeah. All these noble things. I'm thinking, well, if I was a person of color, I would be

01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:02.560
outraged by this, this idea that this is a culture that's alien to me. It's so offensive.

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:10.000
But so absurd. You can hardly mount an argument against it. I mean,

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:16.880
conscientiousness is a personality trait and there's no racial differences in conscientiousness.

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:23.360
Right. And it wouldn't matter to me. If it was just a few idiots on Twitter or these extreme,

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:28.640
it wouldn't matter to me, but these people have disproportionate power, institutional power,

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:34.240
political power. I mean, the Biden administration is on side with an awful lot of this kind of stuff

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:41.920
and the end point. So is the Trudeau government. I mean, to have this in the training documentation

01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:45.920
that's produced by the federal government is just absolutely stunning. It's also the document

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:50.320
that I was referring to. I tweeted about it yesterday. It's so badly written that it's

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:58.320
stunning. It's maddening with him. And how is it he's got away with his history of blackface,

01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:03.120
for instance? How is it that there is no consistency there? Like, you know, it's

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:07.040
lack of effective opposition is a big part of it. It's insane. I mean, if you look at those old

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:10.560
videos, it looks like he spent more time in blackface than out of it. And yet he isn't the one

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:14.480
who's being attacked and vilified for that. It's okay. He's got a free pass. It's weird to me.

01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:19.360
Yeah, well, the opposition in Canada, and this is a problem in general, is a real problem for

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:25.120
our entire culture, is that the woke narrative is very romantically attractive. It's got this

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:30.480
rebelliousness about it and this impetus to go out and march in the streets and, you know, to

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:36.080
work on a global cause. And like traditional conservatives and even traditional liberals

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:42.880
can't mount a counter narrative. They don't have the imagination. And it's a huge problem.

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:46.720
The trouble is, though, the cause that they're fighting for is largely illusory,

01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:52.000
and that to me is very frightening. We've had people in this country claim that our major

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.080
universities, such as Oxford and Cambridge, are structurally institutionally racist. All of the

01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:01.120
data tells us this is just simply not the case. Oh, yes. Well, that's just happening constantly

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:06.480
in Canadian universities. The McGill physics department has now put out a diversity inclusivity

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:11.760
and equity statement that's predicated on exactly those views.

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:18.080
Well, I think we need to push back against this particular hyper-racialization of society,

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:23.360
because it is reinscribing old racial tropes, even to the extent of fear of miscegenation,

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:27.600
this old racist idea of this fear of mixed couples. You know, there was an article in

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:32.640
The Guardian here recently talking about how finding mixed race people attractive is problematic.

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:38.800
It's almost just taking old racist ideas and just giving them a kind of hint of respectability.

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:44.160
Of course, the end point of that is segregation. You saw presumably the story in California,

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:49.360
the Brentwood School, the elite school that segregated its parents, but on their, what was

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:53.040
it, a dialogue session with the teachers, and you would have white parents in one room and

01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:56.000
black parents in the other room. You're seeing that in convocation ceremonies at universities, too.

01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:03.360
How can this be anything other than racist? It's interesting that the group, Fair, the

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:07.600
group Foundation Against Intolerance and Racism, a lot of those people who are doing great work,

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:14.080
I think, are starting to call this neo-racism. There needs to be a label for it. I think maybe

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:18.560
that's the right way to go about it, because the word racism has almost become meaningless,

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:24.320
because the people who use it the most, they throw it around so liberally. I never believe it when I

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:29.040
hear someone branded that way. I assume it's someone not being honest and not being truthful.

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:33.200
So what do we call this? What do you call it when people are advancing the cause of racial

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:38.640
segregation in the name of anti-racism? What do you call that? I think that's going to be the

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:42.960
real struggle. It's not just breaking through the fantasy world. I don't like this idea of

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:47.280
having to negotiate someone else's dreamland. There's that thing, firstly, but also there's

01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:51.360
the linguistic mind fields. How do you convince people? The other reason, I mean, you mentioned

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:56.080
the rebellious aspect of it, I think the other reason why it's so appealing is because the language

01:21:56.080 --> 01:22:02.800
sounds like you're doing good. Social justice, anti-racism. Who wouldn't be anti-racist? Black

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:09.120
lives matter. Of course they do. Who would disagree with that? But these phrasing can be used to push

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:14.800
through some very pernicious ideas. I mean, when it comes to anti-racism, for instance, I mean,

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:19.840
Ibrahim X. Kendi makes it absolutely clear in his book that he feels to be not racist is simply

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:26.800
another form of racism, that this dichotomy doesn't exist. Well, and that's why I find it very hard

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:31.040
when I'm having these arguments, because if I say I have a real problem with anti-racism,

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:35.760
people will say, oh, I see. So you're for racism. And then you have to explain what anti-racism means

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:39.600
when used by these academics in these very niche fields such as whiteness studies. You have to

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:45.920
explain first what that means, why that's dangerous for society, and how in order to genuinely oppose

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:50.080
racism, you have to oppose the discourse of anti-racism. I mean, when you say it like that,

01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:57.120
it's maddening, isn't it? It's like, it's the stuff of nightmares, because there is no coherent

01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:03.200
sense. And because so much of it is rooted in language and misdirection through language and

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:09.360
shielding what is actually meant, it becomes impossible to win the argument. And maybe that's

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:16.240
the point. Maybe this, they gave the word to us, gaslighting. When they gaslight all the time and

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:21.680
say the culture war is a right-wing myth, or cancel the people who are the chief practitioners of

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:26.000
cancer culture saying that cancer culture doesn't exist, when they say the opposite of what is the

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:33.760
observable reality. I don't know how to break through that, how to break through those arguments,

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:37.440
because not only have they constructed a pseudo-reality in their own minds,

01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:41.200
they've constructed the language with which to sustain that pseudo-reality,

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:45.520
so no one else can be drawn out of it. And that to me is going to be the challenge.

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:52.800
Let me ask you, let's go sideways for a minute now. And I suppose this is an exploration of

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:58.080
potential solutions as well. This has been a very serious conversation, but you're a satirist and

01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:03.360
a comedian as well. And so you have to... Isn't it terrible how unfunny I am in real life? Isn't

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:08.240
that awful? When I'm doing stand-up, if I've got a script, I can be funny, but I can't be funny

01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:14.400
spontaneously. People are very disappointed about that. I'm sorry. Well, I'm curious about your

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:20.560
motivations. Let's talk about Titania McGrath. Why don't you define, describe her first for everyone?

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:28.640
So Titania McGrath originated as a Twitter character in around April 2018. And the idea of

01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:35.840
the character is that she is a very privileged, po-faced, young, white, intersectional activist

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:40.320
who is determined to be offended by absolutely anything. She can problematize absolutely anything.

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:46.720
You know, you could give her a pair of shoes or a hat or a holiday in Margate, and she would find a

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:51.440
way to say that it is irredeemably transphobic and white supremacist or something like that.

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:55.680
She can do those things that the activists always do. So nothing is ever good enough for her. She's

01:24:55.680 --> 01:25:00.400
also immensely privileged. She comes from well, independently wealthy background. She lives in,

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:08.960
you know, one of those sort of gated communities, which is 99% white. But she has a deep mistrust

01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:16.480
of the working class. But she thinks that she is virtuous and noble and good, and she goes on

01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:23.840
Twitter and it goes on the attack all the time, trying to isolate things, trying to save the

01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:29.680
world in her through intersectional theory. And it's a very recognizable type of act,

01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:33.440
even if you know nothing about intersectionality or anything of the stuff that came out of

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:36.720
the School of Thought of Kimberly Crenshaw or any of those academics, even if you know nothing

01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:42.080
about that, you will recognize this type of figure because this figure is ubiquitous on Twitter,

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:48.080
on social media. They always have their pronouns in their bio. They always use the same terminology

01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:53.680
such as hegemony or discourse or problematic or phallogocentric, if you want to go back to

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:59.360
Derrida, you know, and she knows the right jargon to use lived experience, cultural appropriation,

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:04.160
mansplaining, toxic masculinity, all of those kind of things. And we know, and all of these things

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:08.880
tend to be slogans in substitute of thought, you know, that they're just things that get thrown

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:13.840
out there. And so what I wanted to do with the character is in slogan means what do you mean

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:19.360
is etymologically? No, I don't sluag garrum. It means battle cry of the dead. I love that.

01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:28.000
That doesn't send a chill up your back. You didn't understand it. Well, that's this is it.

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:34.640
I'm going to use that. That's great because that it is a kind of it's almost like a battleground

01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:40.000
of zombies who don't have any capacity for independent thought anymore. I mean, you try

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.800
to get into a conversation with someone like this. And I have many times. Well, sure. Very

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:50.800
publicly. And the slogans that come back at you all the time. And the lack of interrogation of

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:54.880
those slogans, you know, but what I find so frustrating and so horrifying in some sense,

01:26:54.880 --> 01:27:00.080
I mean, I think a great canonical example of that is the interview that Helen Lewis did with me

01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:06.720
for the for GQ, which is it's now more popular online than the Channel 4 interview, which I

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:12.240
think the GQ interview has like 32 million views or something preposterous. But I never

01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:19.600
did talk to Helen Lewis. I just talked to the ideology and it's not I don't like that. I like

01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:25.040
to talk to the person and find out what they think. But I heard you saying as well that

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:32.880
before the interview, she was very frosty and almost as though she had decided what you were

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:38.000
in advance, funnily enough. Oh, there was no almost. I definitely decided what I was before

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:43.680
the before the discussion. Yeah, exactly. And she's been beating the same drum more recently

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:48.560
as well, which has driven many people to the interview because she published an article in

01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:54.400
the Atlantic Monthly and in another locale as well. So when you're faced with those, I mean,

01:27:54.960 --> 01:28:01.440
I just see it all the time so often. And to give another recent example that we had the obviously

01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:06.640
since the Harry and Meghan interview with Oprah Winfrey. And there was a controversy over here

01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:11.200
because Piers Morgan, who hosts a show called Good Morning Britain, got into an argument with

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:16.320
another colleague on the show, Mancoyl Alex Beresford, I think. And it was really interesting

01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:20.480
watching once they'd had the argument, they sat down, they tried to talk through the issues.

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:23.920
And Piers Morgan pointed out that some of the things that Meghan had said in the interview

01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:29.040
were factually wrong and had been proven to be factually wrong. His response was Alex Beresford's

01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:33.280
response was, but that's her lived experience. And then he said, yes, but we have the evidence

01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:37.680
here that it is factually incorrect. And again, he said, but it's her lived experience. So in other

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:43.520
words, see, that's that insistence that the fantasy world, the subjective world trumps everything.

01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:50.240
Right. And that once you've, it's almost like these, these phrases, if you use the right, if you

01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:53.600
use the phrase lived experience or toxic masculinity, whatever, you're in the club,

01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:57.600
what you've signaled that you're, you're, you're right. You know, and I know that academics have

01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:00.560
always done this, you know, the jargon, you're in the group, you're in the in-group, if you've

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:04.000
got the right, if you know how to deploy the right words. But there's something more sinister

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.960
about this because it is morally right in these situations. That's the sinister thing.

01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:15.280
That's it. It's morally incontrovertible. You've made the statement and that's it. And there's

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:19.360
no further discussion. Yes, well, you're not evil. That's what you're saying. I'm not evil.

01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:25.120
So I think, so with, so the reason with Titania, I wanted her to be obsessed with this language.

01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:30.320
And so, and, and, and why I read so much of this stuff so that I knew the way that they speak

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:36.960
is because I thought the best way to expose the inherent contradictions of, of, of that position

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:42.640
and the thoughtlessness moreover, the thoughtlessness of that position is, is, is to, to embody it in

01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:47.360
a character. Right. So you were playing, you were playing a dramatic game, essentially,

01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:53.040
which is a form of thought. In doing so, I've actually come to understand the people I'm

01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:57.360
satirizing a whole lot more. And look, let's face it, every now and then they'll hit on a point that

01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:02.480
is actually right. And, and, you know, even when I read White Fragility by Robin D'Angelo, which I

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:06.320
think is a terrible book and is, is, is so flawed throughout every now and then she'll hit on something

01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:10.320
and you think for a moment, oh, there's something in that. And then she'll undercut it by saying,

01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:13.680
well, everyone's a racist and all the rest of it, you know, and it just goes back to being absurd.

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:19.040
But, and that book in of itself is a very good example of this, you know, setting up a reality

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:24.960
that cannot be penetrated because she will say that any kind of critical questioning of her

01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:29.680
position is evidence of the very pervasiveness of white supremacy that she's identified. So you

01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:34.720
can't win because even engaging in a discussion is proof of your malevolence, according to her

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:40.080
theory, it's absolutely hopeless. But I thought, I thought, I thought because the movement is so

01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:45.680
riven with contradiction, actually, the more effective way of tackling it isn't through dialogue,

01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:51.040
firstly, because the people I'm talking about seem impervious to reason. They mistrust dialogue,

01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:54.640
they see debate as a form of violence. So you're never going to get through to them that way.

01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:57.840
Yeah, and that that's actually an explicit part of the theory.

01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:02.400
It really is. So then in creating a satirical character, it's not that they're anti free

01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:08.000
speech, there's no such thing as free speech in that theoretical framework. No, it's a misapprehension

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.240
all the way down to the bottom, which is why I get so frustrated. I've often been in debates

01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:16.880
where I've tried to invite these very people to participate in the debate to hear them out.

01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:22.640
And they would say that to even appear would be to dignify the position. So it's an absolute

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:28.560
nightmare. And it also protects themselves from potential criticism, which is, of course,

01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:33.360
the whole point. But I thought by creating a satirical character that embodies those

01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:41.120
contradictions, that thoughtlessness, it might reflect back onto them. I suppose how they look

01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:44.960
to normal people, because I don't think they appreciate, I think they're so caught up within

01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:49.200
their own little bubbles, with their own little groups, they never hear an alternative point

01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:53.920
of view. I mean, I used to work with academics like this, who were so within their little groups,

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:57.840
and they're constantly quoting each other and supporting each other and giving the illusion

01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:03.920
that their views cannot be disputed. But what if you're suddenly confronted

01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:08.000
with how other people perceive you? And will that give you pause for thought?

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:13.280
Okay, so when you started Titania, you didn't announce that she was a satirical character.

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:18.000
You started playing on Twitter. Tell me the story. What exactly would happen? Because

01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:24.400
that Twitter account became extraordinarily well known and very rapidly. So I'm curious about

01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:31.200
how you did that and how you responded once it started to amass some cultural significance.

01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:39.600
I was very surprised that it became so popular so quickly. And I'd started it

01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:44.000
because I'm more to entertain myself more than anything. I was so frustrated with this,

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:49.440
and I wanted to try and expose the absurdity of it. I mean, my background is a stand-up comic.

01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:53.840
And as a stand-up comic, I'm not necessarily satirical. I will stand there on a stage

01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:58.640
and ridicule the thing that I perceive to be a problem with society. With satire,

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:04.800
what you're doing is you're often embodying it with a kind of ironic detachment or you're addressing it.

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:09.040
You're always going after what you perceive to be the vices and follies of society,

01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:13.200
and I thought that was a good way of doing it. Right, so you had to stay on a kind of edge.

01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:19.040
You had to be believable enough as the character so that you could pass, but you had to push it

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:25.920
just past the point of what? Of rationality or believability? It's a funny edge.

01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:29.840
I was continually getting into arguments with people and staying in character. I've always

01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:34.800
stayed in character even to today. And I've actually, if you go to the Titania account now,

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:40.720
my pinned thread is a thread of conversations that I've had with people in character who are

01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:44.720
angry about the things I've tweeted. And these can go on for pages and pages. And it's fascinating

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:50.160
to me because it's close enough to the truth. She says really ridiculous things, really absurd

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:55.760
things like speaking or writing in English as an act of colonial violence. She'll say that.

01:33:56.560 --> 01:34:01.200
The only way to guard against fascism is if the state are allowed to arrest people for what they

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:06.560
say and think. Stuff like this, which is so obviously absurd, and yet it's close enough

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:12.000
to what people actually say that people believe it and get annoyed about it. And what I've always

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:18.560
liked to do is to stay in character and have those conversations with these people. And then

01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:24.080
I posted the screenshots of the conversation. But part of the point of that is not to humiliate the

01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:28.240
people who had fallen for it, because actually the point I'm making is I understand why they would

01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:35.360
fall for it because it's so close to what people actually say. And by doing that, my hope is,

01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:41.760
I suppose, that it exposes the folly of this stuff. Sometimes even when I'm in those arguments,

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:46.880
I will say something that is so out of the, out of, you know, just completely out of the realm

01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:54.560
of possibility, so stupid. And yet they still don't, things have become so absurd that they don't

01:34:55.440 --> 01:35:01.200
twig. I mean, even today, there was a story today in the UK, a museum, a Jane Austen museum,

01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:06.640
is now going to interrogate Jane Austen's use of sugar in her tea, because it has connections to

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:11.280
plantations and white supremacy and slavery. You know, something like that, which is just so

01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:17.440
absurd, or the recent controversy over Bluey, the Australian cartoon dog, because it doesn't have

01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:23.360
enough dogs of color and gender diverse dogs in the cartoon. Now, that sounds like something I would

01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:29.040
make up as a joke. But it's real, it's actually happening and people are taking it seriously.

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:34.480
And so therefore, in a sense, it's become harder with Titania, because anything that I come up with

01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:39.840
is going to be topped by real life very, very quickly.

01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:45.920
So what have you learned about the people that Titania annoys? So she's a hyper politically

01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:53.120
correct avatar, and but she tangles up people who are opposed to that sort of thing. And so that

01:35:53.120 --> 01:36:00.720
must have also shed substantial light for you on people on the other side of the, and so what have

01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:06.320
you learned? Well, one of the things is that the people on the other side, who might even be quite,

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:12.320
might even be of my opinion about these things. A lot of people are very quick to anger,

01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:20.560
and verbal abuse as a goat, as an instant response. So a lot of the people who get

01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:26.000
angry with her really go after her looks. And I mean, she's not real, a friend of mine, Lisa,

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:30.960
created the image of the woman is just a composite of four different women. So it's not a parody.

01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:34.400
You see, this is the thing, it's not a parody of any particular person, it's a, it's a type of,

01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:40.800
of person. And yeah, the people who get angry with her and the people who are genuinely angry

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:45.600
about the social justice movement are absolutely furious about the way it is impinging on every

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:49.280
aspect of their lives, they are sick of it. So when they see someone as extreme as Titania,

01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:53.120
they really let rip. And I don't think that's healthy. You know, it's not in my nature to go

01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:59.920
and abuse someone online or to get angry online. But I've seen the extent, what it shows, I suppose,

01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:06.480
is that that kind of instinct to immediately go for the abusive or the vicious or the attack

01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:12.640
or the ad hominem is present across the political spectrum. It's everywhere. Or maybe that's just

01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:20.080
a sign of Twitter, maybe that's just a symptom of social media. And I've learned a lot about

01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:23.920
how social media works. I think that's, that's another thing about it is that I've really,

01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:29.440
for one thing, the fact that she's, she's been banned a number of times and I've learned how

01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:36.000
to avoid the bans and about the way that big tech censors and how they censor and why.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:41.920
What if, what does she be banned for? So the tweets that she was banned for a couple of times,

01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:46.880
she's had a number of one day suspensions, a number of seven day suspensions. Once or twice,

01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:52.240
it's been inexplicable to me why, why she would be banned. It seems a bit like someone at Silicon

01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:56.480
Valley has twigged that their precious ideology is being mocked and they don't like it. That,

01:37:56.480 --> 01:38:01.440
that's the only explanation I could think of. However, on a couple of instances, it's when she's,

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:06.080
I suppose, what they would say incited violence. And of course, she hasn't done anything of the

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:11.280
kind. There was one tweet where she said she was going to go to a UKIP rally. UKIP is a right-wing

01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:15.920
nationalist political party in the UK. And she said, I'm going to go to this UKIP rally to punch

01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:20.160
people in the name of compassion or love or something like that, you know, which is the idea

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:25.520
that a lot of these activists have that actually, whereas words are violence and awful, actual

01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:30.720
physical violence can be defended, you know, in their, in their view, it's so perverse. And of course,

01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:36.560
I was making a comment about the perversity of that idea that you think microaggressions are,

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:41.040
are actual violence, but you're perfectly content to go out and set fire to cars and beat

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:44.320
people up if they have the wrong opinion or pepper spray people in the face if they voted for

01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:47.840
Trump. You know, there's an obvious, there's an obvious contradiction there that I was

01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:51.680
trying to expose. So she had a ban there. I think that might have even been the one where

01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:56.160
she was permanently banned. I had an email from Twitter saying, this is a permanent ban,

01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:00.560
you're not getting back on. And then there was a bit of an outcry from, from, from people who

01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:05.120
follow her, some prominent people who follow her, and Twitter rescinded that changed their minds

01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:09.600
and brought her back. And as a result of that, inevitably, her follower count leapt because

01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:13.280
of course, when you try and censor something, you draw attention to it, but you're always treading

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:17.680
a fine line. I mean, my friend, Lisa, who I mentioned, Lisa Graves used to have a Twitter

01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:22.320
account called Jarvis de Pong, who was one of my favorite accounts on Twitter. And he was

01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:27.360
banned, completely permanently banned. They actually went on a bit of a purge of satire

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:33.120
accounts. There was one afternoon where Twitter purged 12 or 13 satirical accounts and deleted

01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:38.400
them. Titania came back for some reason, I think it's because she was the bigger account.

01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:42.960
But a lot of them just got ditched. And that I think shows that, you know, the powers that

01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:47.040
be at Silicon Valley, they don't like to be mocked. They don't, well, no one in authority likes to

01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:51.520
be mocked. It's the best way to undermine authority, isn't it? And it's, it's why every despot in

01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:57.200
history has killed the clown. Well, that's why we have to be so careful when any of our laws

01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:02.240
start making comedians nervous. They're the ultimate canary in the coal mine.

01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:06.960
Even more so than artists, I think. The artists are next, probably, but.

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:11.440
Absolutely. I mean, you, you'll know in Canada, Mike Ward was fined, I think $42,000

01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:16.560
by the Quebec Human Rights Commission for a joke that he told, if you, and by the way, if you,

01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:20.000
you know, this is not. Yes, and Montreal, of course, has one of the world's great comedy

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.400
festivals. And, and some of that humor, I've been to the comedy festival a couple of times,

01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:30.320
and at midnight, you can go and hear particularly outrageous comedy, which I actually think it

01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:35.280
was one of those where he said what he got fined for. And I, you know, I don't even know the

01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:39.360
context because he said it in French for one thing. So I don't fully understand. But I read

01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:44.000
the transcript and I spoke to him about it. And what was interesting is that he's not some,

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:48.240
you know, open Mike Act who's, who doesn't, hasn't been on the set. He's an established,

01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:53.600
famous, successful comedian who was, who was fined for a joke that if you actually break

01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:58.560
it down and analyze it, there's nothing remotely offensive about it. You know, I mean, it's

01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:03.360
perfectly, I don't think comedy can, can exist without the potential to cause offense.

01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:10.480
No, neither can truth. Right, quite. Comedy is almost always truth, almost always.

01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:14.880
That comedian says something funny and it's true in a way that people didn't expect and they know it.

01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:22.080
Well, it's also that, it's also that thing of, of, of, of teasing the boundaries of tolerance,

01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:26.640
of, of, of almost, almost having that kind of cathartic effect, the way that the, the ancient

01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:30.800
Greeks would watch a tragedy and, and hear about this dismemberment and all sorts of

01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:37.200
vying to philosophically to purge themselves of the, of that evil that lay within. In a sense,

01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:42.960
when you hear a comedian say something utterly outrageous, it can have that effect on you and

01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:47.200
you laugh in spite of yourself. And then you laugh again, because you are saying to yourself,

01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:50.080
why did I laugh at that? That makes me, I shouldn't have done that. So you're almost

01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:54.240
laughing at your own response as well. It has a double effect. And we are really losing that.

01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:59.520
I mean, I don't know how it is in Canada, but, but, but in the UK, a lot of this kind of

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:03.280
mistrust of comedy and mistrust of jokes and the idea that certain jokes

01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:07.200
normalize hatred is coming from the comedians themselves. And a lot of comedians

01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:12.080
take it on themselves to police other comedians' material and they get very angry

01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:17.440
when people broach certain subjects. I consider it very, very unhealthy. And not all comedians,

01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:21.040
by the way, I'm not saying that all comedians, I'm just saying, certainly the more establishment

01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:25.520
comedians absolutely would fall into this category. And it's, it's really shocked me. This has been,

01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:30.800
since I started to Tanya in particular, a lot of comedians have been very angry that I mocked

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:36.080
the social justice movement or, you know, that I, you know, which to me is a bit absurd, because,

01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:41.680
you know, I spent years, three years writing, co-writing the Jonathan Pye character. And because

01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:48.000
that predominantly mocked Trump and the right and conservatives. And, and, you know, it went,

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:53.440
those were the targets, that was okay. So I never got this kind of venom about, about that. But as

01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:58.080
soon as I was mocking social justice ideology, which I perceived to be an extremely powerful

01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:02.480
ideology, you know, this isn't, I don't think I'm punching down. I think I'm punching up at these,

01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:06.800
at these, at these people who have captured these institutions and, and are ruthless, by the way,

01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:11.120
absolutely ruthless and bullying. I think the social justice movement utterly legitimizes bullying.

01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:14.880
And I don't like bullies. And I like to stand up to bullies. And that to Tanya is my attempt to

01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:19.440
stand up against the bullies. But what they will do is misrepresent my intentions and will say,

01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:24.000
oh, no, you just want to have a go at gay people or whatever, or have a go at minority groups. And,

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:29.520
and I've been very shocked by that, because that, that kind of response has even come from comedians.

01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:34.640
And my view is that if you've got half a brain, you know, that's not what I'm doing. You, I mean,

01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:39.680
you absolutely have to know that that's what not what I'm doing. And yet, maybe they do know, maybe

01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:44.160
they, maybe this is a willfulness interpretation as a means to attack me, because I've, because I've

01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:48.880
mocked the ideology I'm not meant to mock. But I tell you what, whenever there's, whenever there

01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:52.640
are consequences for mocking someone, then I think that's the person you ought to be mocking, right?

01:43:52.640 --> 01:44:02.640
I think that's a sign. Do you, would you, what effect has producing to Tanya had on your life?

01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:06.880
And, and if you could go back and decide whether you were going to do it again, would you?

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.800
I mean, it must be shocking. I would think it's shocking to have, have seen what happened

01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:17.920
to be at the center of what happened when you created that character. But I'd like to know.

01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:23.200
I, well, for one thing, I didn't, yeah, I didn't expect the reaction that I got. Also,

01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:27.920
you've got to remember that for a long time, the character I was anonymous. Because I, I,

01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:31.520
part of the effects of the character was that people thought she was real. That was so

01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:37.200
sort of integral to it. And then I was outed by a newspaper over here the week that her first

01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:42.480
book came out. And that although that was very good for the books, it generated a lot of publicity,

01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:47.120
because then the story became that I was the person behind the character. In effect, it had

01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:52.080
an innovating impact on the, on the, on the character, because now what happens, people know

01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:55.920
it's me behind the character, people. However, what I will say is even to this day, there's

01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:58.640
always some people who fall for it whenever I tweet something, there's always some people

01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:03.600
who fall for it. So it has that. So, so there's that. But then there's the impact on my personal

01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:11.920
life. Well, I would do it again, because I feel very passionately that the, the, the movement

01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:16.560
that I'm mocking, the ideology that I'm mocking is a dangerous one. And I feel very passionately

01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:24.560
that it is divisive and damaging to society as damaging as any ideology can be. I think it has

01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:31.840
the potential to go to those lengths. And, and so that I think I would almost be in dereliction if

01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:35.840
I, if I didn't mock it, it would be, it would be, I tell you what it would be, it would be an act of

01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:40.400
self censorship, if I didn't go after these targets. And that's by the way, how most comedians, I mean,

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:43.440
a lot of comedians think this stuff is ridiculous. They won't go near it because they know that if

01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:46.960
they do, they won't get on the BBC and they won't get booked by certain clubs. So they just leave

01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:53.520
it well alone. But I think I couldn't do, I could, I just, that's not in my nature. So I,

01:45:54.160 --> 01:46:00.800
so I don't regret that. The fact that so many friends of mine, former friends on the company

01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:05.680
circuit no longer talk to me, that's something which I suppose I could say is unfortunate.

01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:10.560
On the other hand, how many times has that happened to you? How many friends do you think

01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:15.840
you've lost? It's in double figures. It's certainly in double figures. And I think,

01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:22.640
and it's not just Tanya, it's also partly, I suppose, my politics. It's also,

01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:30.960
it's effectively being honest about what I think and saying opinions that might not be the establishment

01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:36.560
of fashionable opinions. And it gets people very angry. I mean, one particular incident I could

01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:40.240
think of was when I met for a drink with two friends, very old friends of mine, a married

01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:45.920
couple. And he started screaming at me in the pub, I won't swear on your podcast, but calling me

01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:49.440
an effing Nazi. And then another word, which I probably shouldn't say at this point.

01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:56.720
But, and I thought he was joking at first. And we had this conversation. And it was true. He'd,

01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:02.960
he'd completely bought into this fantasy of who I was. And, and there was no going back from that.

01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:07.280
And I know it was fueled by alcohol, but no apology was forthcoming or no,

01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:12.080
you know, it's, and then every now and then there'll be, I mean, it happened to be a couple of

01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:15.920
months ago, we're a comedian I've known for many, many years from the circuit, suddenly sent me

01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:21.200
this abusive message online on Twitter and started attacking me and saying I was, he said I was

01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:29.920
funded by dark foreign powers or something utterly absurd, you know, and, and I thought, well, okay,

01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:34.400
so this is now- Of course, that is what you'd say if you were funded by dark foreign powers.

01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:38.240
Well, this is, this is the problem. Like I said, you know, I've said it before, like, if, you know,

01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:41.520
if I am getting all this dark money, it must be very dark because I haven't seen any of it. It's

01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:46.960
not, you know, that'd be great. Fine. But I'm not. And this idea that I'm this sort of, it's that

01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:51.280
going right back to what you said at the start, like that I'm defending free speech, because I,

01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:55.680
I, because I'm an evil person who wants to say evil things. And so there's all of that.

01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:00.560
All that I'm mocking, I'm mocking minority groups through to Tanya, which is absolutely not what

01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:07.520
I'm doing. It's the opposite. I'm mocking those very affluent and powerful people who very patronizingly

01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:11.760
assume that they, they, they know what's best for minorities, you know, it's the opposite of what

01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:19.920
people say it is. But these kind of experiences, on the one hand, I think it's a bit sad, isn't

01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:24.560
it? Because there are people now, I've had to go through my phone and delete lots of numbers,

01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:29.200
because I know we'll never talk again. But on the other hand, were they my friends to begin with?

01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:35.200
I'm not so sure, you know, if they can, if they can suddenly become so bigoted. And that is the

01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:40.080
word. Well, it's an indication of how profound the divide has started to become in our culture,

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:45.920
right? That I mean, 20 years ago, I never lost any friends because of my hypothetical political

01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:52.560
opinions. But things have changed. You must have lost your, your case must be much more severe than

01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:58.000
mine. You know, because you're so much more famous and so much more known has have lots of friends

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:05.920
turned on you. No, actually, not a lot. Some, there's some outstanding exceptions, although even

01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:10.400
in those situations, I would say there was extenuating circumstances. No, I've been,

01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:17.760
I've been really fortunate in that regard that my, my close circle of, of intimates my family and

01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:23.040
my, my close friends have been staggeringly loyal to me under. Which is wonderful.

01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:27.840
Severe distress. Yes. That's wonderful. So is it maybe the case? Does that tell us

01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:32.400
that actually what it's really about is the fact that I was working in an industry,

01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:38.480
which is, you know, the, the comedy industry is so on board with the woke ideology to such an

01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:44.640
extent that in fact, so many of it's, it's so many comedians are now really just

01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:50.400
advertised for that, for that ideology, maybe. Maybe. I mean, my professional colleagues certainly

01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:54.080
haven't leapt to my defense. Well, that's, that's what I was going to ask, actually. Yes.

01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:59.200
Surely. No, that's been, no, that's pretty much done with. I mean, I would say my name,

01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:04.640
I've decided this recently because of the slurs that have been associated with me.

01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:12.960
I can't in good conscience accept graduate students anymore. Because if they go out, you know,

01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:18.800
you talked at the beginning about this register where that's been set up in Britain, where if you

01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:27.360
are charged, accused of a non-crime hate act, it's recorded without a trial. I mean, I've been on

01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:34.000
hiring committees many, many times. And especially in academia, there's an oversupply of highly

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:40.800
qualified people, of radical oversupply. And so if there's anything in your record at all that's

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:47.600
the least bit contentious, it's like you're, you're done. And so being my student, that's not

01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:53.600
a little bit contentious. That's really, really contentious. And so it's now become impossible

01:50:53.600 --> 01:51:01.360
for me to, to, to serve my proper function as a, as a scientist and as a university professor. So

01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:07.200
that's, it's taking a lot of adjustment on my part to get accustomed to that. And I don't practice

01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:13.280
clinically anymore as well. And there are a variety of reasons for that. But certainly the,

01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:22.400
I've become very, very susceptible to attacks through the College of Psychologists,

01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:30.080
the governing board. They can make the life of a practitioner brutally miserable with a single

01:51:30.080 --> 01:51:39.520
letter. And that's very, very punishing. And it's also perhaps not necessarily good for my

01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:44.560
potential clients to be associated with someone who's controversial. They already have enough

01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:50.720
trouble. So although I've been fortunate on the family and friends front, the, on the professional

01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:58.000
front, things have, have been, you know, more dismal. Isn't that just suggestive of the, of the,

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:02.720
the power of this movement and, and the effectiveness of cancel culture? In fact,

01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:08.480
the way, the ease with which people can become stigmatized, you know, all it takes is a few

01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:13.760
accusations of your far right or alt-right or whatever. And it's there, you know, any prospective

01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:18.160
employer can Google that and it comes up and who's going to take the risk? You know, the accusation

01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:25.040
is sufficient to damn you. And, and that's, that's what. Well, that you put the finger on the, on

01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:31.760
the absolute catastrophe of the non-crime hate index. It's like, well, it's, it's a permanent

01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:37.840
stain, especially in a, in a technological universe where nothing is ever forgotten,

01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:43.360
no matter how long the lag. And it's worse because the government here feels no compunction

01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:50.800
to address this or to no politician seem to has, well, I suppose they are, well, because the strategy

01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:54.720
is that if you oppose hate speech laws, you're obviously a hateful person. Why else would you

01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:58.160
oppose hate speech law? You know, it's the old thing and, and a politician doesn't want to stand

01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:02.160
up in parliament to be the one who is seen to be siding with the evil guys, the bad guys.

01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:06.720
So you have to make a very, very subtle argument to stand up against hate speech laws because

01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:12.320
you're faced with the problem that there is such a thing as hate speech. Yeah. Obviously. So when

01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:18.960
it's pernicious and terrible, it's like, okay. So you're arguing uphill. This is again why it's

01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:25.040
such a bloody miracle that we ever had free speech to begin with. It's almost inconceivable to me that

01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:32.560
we managed to generate the baseline presumption of innocence. That's a miracle. The fact that you

01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:38.960
can go bankrupt and start again, that's a miracle. The idea that you ever had free speech and that

01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:45.600
that was genuinely the case, that's a miracle. And none of this is given the appropriate respect

01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:51.600
and awe that it deserves because it's so unlikely. It's hugely unlikely. I mean, I know in the book,

01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:56.480
I talk about, I give a kind of very, very short history of free speech from the ancient Greeks

01:53:56.480 --> 01:54:02.000
to today. And the point of that is to accentuate this point that actually the fact that we have it

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:07.360
is astonishing and unlikely, so unlikely. And all the more reason why we need to defend it,

01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:14.000
we need to be really, really vigilant about any cracks that appear in this, because it will go

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:18.560
away very, very easily, you know, if we don't defend it. And it's hard, particularly when it comes to

01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:25.040
the idea of, that's why I wrote a chapter on hate speech, because, and took the other side's view

01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:30.000
seriously, because just trashing the opposing argument isn't going to help. We have to talk

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:34.880
about it and explain why it's important nevertheless. Well, for one thing, like you say,

01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:40.800
hateful speech exists. Let's start from that point. Let's acknowledge that that hateful speech exists,

01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:46.480
and it can be hurtful, and it can do damage. But then the alternative is a state that might,

01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:51.440
in the future, be completely unscrupulous, that is going to decide for you what you can say. And

01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:55.840
those are the things that we have to tackle. And the other key thing is that no one knows how to

01:54:55.840 --> 01:55:01.360
define hate speech. You know, UNESCO, the European Court of Human Rights, they've all agreed,

01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:05.760
there's no way to define hate speech. Every European country that has hate speech laws

01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:10.720
has different hate speech laws, different definitions, subjective, abstract concepts,

01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:15.680
such as hate, such as offence, such as a perception, you know, and these are on the

01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:18.720
statute books, and you don't want this stuff on the statute books, because it's all very well.

01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:23.120
I mean, I know the, we talked about the SMP and their hate crime bill, the defense I'm always

01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:28.400
running into, is people are saying, yes, okay, technically, someone could be arrested and imprisoned

01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:34.000
for saying some, an offensive joke, technically, yes. But no one in their right mind, no jury,

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:40.880
no judge is going to, we've got common sense, it's okay. Well, that's so myopic. I mean,

01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:44.320
what, because you don't know who's going to be in charge in 10 years time. You don't know who

01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:48.720
that judge is going to be. How can you possibly just... You can be certain that someone will be

01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:55.920
in charge that doesn't approve of you and that you don't approve of, that will, that will certainly

01:55:55.920 --> 01:56:03.600
happen. You don't want vague, vague wording on the statute books. It's going to be exploited

01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:07.280
at some point, even though, even if it's not today, there's absolutely no way that you can

01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:13.360
guarantee it against future, against the future abuses of that. And I don't, it is, as you say,

01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:20.400
it's a certainty. So I think it's actually one of the most important arguments that we should make

01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:26.560
and that free speech needs to be defended in every successive generation. It's not something that

01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:31.600
you know this, you get it and then it's there forever. No, that's not true. There's something

01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:36.080
about human nature. There's something about people in power. There's something about the way that we

01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:45.280
are that it will collapse. It's an edifice that is not secure at any given time. But it's hard.

01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:49.600
It's that thing of being smeared. The risk is you're going to be smeared. You're going to be

01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:53.360
associated with the worst possible kinds of people because, of course, it's only really

01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:56.960
controversial speech that ever requires protection. And people are going to say,

01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:02.640
well, then you must support what these awful people are saying. And it's hard to make the case.

01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:06.480
But it's a case that nonetheless has to be made. And particularly by politicians,

01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:11.440
I've been incredibly disappointed by the way in which politicians in this country have not

01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:18.000
made any kind of effort to, if anything, as from what I can see, there are moves even in the

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.880
English parliament to push through further hate speech laws. We should be repealing them,

01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:24.400
not pushing for them. But no one wants to have the argument. No one wants to be tainted.

01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:28.800
Yeah, well, they get identified one by one and taken out. That's what happens.

01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:33.840
Where you get put on a list. This is it. The identitarian left, if that's what we're going

01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:36.880
to call them. I don't know what to call them. That's the problem. They're very clever about

01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:42.160
evading even a label. But they like making their lists. They like observing and saying,

01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:50.160
you know, you are problematic. You have sinned. And now they have an electronic trail.

01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:54.800
These are the people that absolutely love going through all of your old tweets and messages

01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:59.920
and anything they can find. And of course, the point about that is you can do that to anyone.

01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:03.920
There is no one alive who, if you had complete unfettered access to everything they've ever

01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:07.600
written online or in their emails or text messages, that you couldn't construct a

01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:11.680
case to dam someone. That's actually one of the things that's more or less saved me.

01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:18.000
Is that right? Well, by the time I made my political statement, which was a philosophical

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:23.600
statement or even a spiritual statement, not a political statement, I already had 200 hours of

01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:29.440
lectures online. And so essentially everything I'd ever said to students was recorded. And

01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:36.320
it wasn't possible to pull out a smoking pistol. This was very smart. And also, I mean,

01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:41.680
but this is why it's also astonishing. I find it unendingly astonishing the way you are mischaracterized

01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:46.240
because it's all there. Everything you think is out in the open. You've been very, very,

01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:51.360
very clear and explicit about your point of view. And so when they try and demonize you and turn

01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:54.560
you into this thing, people can check and they'll realize that you're there. I think what they're

01:58:54.560 --> 01:59:00.000
doing is they're relying on the reputational damage being a kind of barrier to people even

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:05.040
investigating who you really are. Yeah, well, to some degree, that that works. But it doesn't

01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:11.200
really work because what genuine generally happens is that, you know, for every person who

01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:17.120
wouldn't open a lecture because of my reputation, there's three or four who do because they're

01:59:17.120 --> 01:59:23.920
curious. And then it has an even more perverse effect on, in some cases, on the true believers

01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:30.800
because they're primed to find anything I said offensive, but that doesn't happen,

01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:34.960
or maybe they even find it useful. And then that's not good at all. It's like, well,

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:40.560
it's not interesting when you meet the people, when you get into conversation with people and

01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:45.280
you can see that you're not what they thought you were. And they don't know quite what to do with

01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:51.760
that. And that to me is why another reason why we need more speech, not less, we need to have

01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:56.160
the conversation so that people can be disabused of the fantasies that they've been wallowing in.

01:59:56.880 --> 02:00:01.840
But I do very much enjoy that when people expect one thing and then they actually

02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:08.400
speak to me and they don't see that, that there's no evidence of it because it doesn't exist.

02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:12.640
Yeah, well, it's interesting to watch that unfold in the public domain too. I mentioned those two

02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:19.520
interviews, the Channel 4 interview that is being viral and the interview by Helen Lewis at GQ.

02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:26.320
Those interviews basically consist of nothing but

02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:34.000
the attempt by the interlocutor to have a conversation with the person that exists in

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.240
their imagination. Right, but what's the point of that?

02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:40.240
There's almost no relationship to me at all. That was particularly the case with

02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:47.600
Cathy Newman and was less so with Helen Lewis, but that was still essentially the issue.

02:00:48.160 --> 02:00:52.160
It's quite reassuring, though, isn't it, that once it's out there, people can see through it?

02:00:52.880 --> 02:01:01.200
It's very reassuring. What saved me, and this has given me an endless supply of hope, I would say,

02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:07.840
is that all I've ever had to do is just show everything. It's like, here's the situation,

02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:18.720
no edits. This is what happened, and every time so far, I haven't been fatally damaged.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:25.840
Yeah, I mean, one of the things I've learned most, I think, since Tatania kicked off and

02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:33.200
it became a known thing, is I've learned simply never to trust the perception of someone as

02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:41.200
as constructed in the media or online. It's never the same person. I've ended up

02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:45.680
coming from the background I did. Most of my friends were always on the left. I didn't really

02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:49.760
know conservative people, and now I have a lot of friends who are conservatives,

02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:55.360
and they're just not this villain that they were made out to be, and even some famous

02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:58.880
conservatives who people have said they're absolute monsters, they're evil, they want to eat babies,

02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:03.120
basically, or the equivalent, and you get to know them, and you realize, oh my goodness,

02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:11.040
the perception is so far removed from the reality that even I once had bought into it myself,

02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:15.040
because everyone's telling you this. Yeah, the same thing. I certainly had that experience

02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:20.800
repeatedly, repeatedly. I never trust it now. Whenever I hear the way people talk about people

02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:25.520
online, I never trust it. Unless I know someone personally, I'm never going to trust that again.

02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:34.080
I think that's an important lesson for me. What's next for you? Also, how do you make a living?

02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:38.560
You can't make a living as Detainee McGrath. I mean, you're locked down still, so it's

02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:44.880
got to be hard being a comedian. Right. Well, comedy came to an end. I did a

02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:53.600
tour, I did a stand-up comedy tour in early 2019, and that was really the last big thing I did,

02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:59.280
because as soon as I was about to do some more live performances, the lockdown came, and it's

02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:02.960
the same. I'm not complaining, because absolutely every live performer has the identical experience,

02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:09.600
and we've all, you know, I'm not in a position to complain. Yeah, it's a very good question.

02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:14.720
I like it, because it's also very direct. How do I make my money? Well, I write articles for

02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:22.960
various publications. There's the Titania books have kept me going. I obviously used to work on

02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:27.680
the Jonathan Pye character. We had a couple of television shows and live tours. Those were

02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:31.600
particularly lucrative. And for a long time, I did just make my money as a stand-up comic,

02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:37.600
so literally just the money I would make from the circuit. Now, I've just got a job with,

02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:46.560
well, it's, you know, I gave up being a full-time teacher for this, and I was on a regular wage.

02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:53.760
It was a good salary, and I left it at great risk, you know, because I don't come from a wealthy

02:03:53.760 --> 02:04:00.400
family. I don't have the means to support myself without this kind of stuff. So I went, well,

02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:05.040
I actually went part-time first and was on the stand-up circuit. And then I started earning

02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:10.960
enough from the stand-up to get by. And so I went full-time stand-up, but I was really,

02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:16.000
I was genuinely struggling financially for a long time. And then Jonathan Pye happened,

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:20.880
which was very successful, particularly because we had a big viral hit around the time of the

02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:24.560
Donald Trump election, which actually went viral in America as well. And that really helped

02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:27.680
broaden the character. And then we did live tours and all the rest of it. We played the

02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:33.200
London Palladium and the Hammersmith Apollo. And so it was a big thing for me. And then Tatania

02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:38.080
happened, and the book did very well, and the second book did well. And how many copies do you,

02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:41.280
you don't have to tell me, obviously, but how many copies? I don't know. Actually, the truth is,

02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:45.200
I don't know. That's something I should ask at some point. It's the sort of thing I don't look

02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:51.520
into. You know, I got a royalty check the other day, and I thought, I thought it was done. And

02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:55.600
actually, this was quite a lot of money. I thought, okay, that's good. This is something that can

02:04:55.600 --> 02:05:02.240
keep me going. But I've also just got a new job as a broadcaster on a new channel called GB News

02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:11.600
in the UK. And that will be a pretty full-time, full-on presenter job. But what's good about

02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:16.400
that job is, you know, I think we have a real problem with the news media in this country is

02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:20.800
that we don't have enough diversity of thought and the conversations that we ought to be having.

02:05:20.800 --> 02:05:24.880
This gives me an opportunity to do that. So it's very much related to the work I've been doing.

02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:31.200
But in addition, I'm going to continue with my comedy work and Tatania. We're doing some live

02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:36.400
shows with Tatania, played by an actress. We did that just before the lockdown. We had to postpone

02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:43.280
the tour. Now we're going to do another one. So I will, yeah, a lot of people get very scared by

02:05:44.080 --> 02:05:46.960
making a living as a creative person because you're always on the line.

02:05:46.960 --> 02:05:49.840
As they should be. Jesus, it's a tough way to make a living, man.

02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:54.720
It really, I mean, you're taking a massive risk. And most creatives I know are very,

02:05:54.720 --> 02:05:57.840
very poor. You know, it's simply not, and most have other jobs, you know.

02:05:57.840 --> 02:06:01.520
Yeah, there's a tiny fraction that are hyper-rich and everyone else starves.

02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:06.000
Virtually no one. And I consider myself extremely fortunate to be able to do this full,

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:10.480
the stuff I love, full-time. Because for most of my adult career, I couldn't.

02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:15.120
And I was, you know, I had to have a full-time job and as well as go out in the evenings

02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:22.960
and do all of this stuff. And so it's a real, you have to really commit. And you also have to be

02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:27.920
aware in the back of your mind of the likelihood of failure. That's, you know,

02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:33.200
that's the other thing that you have to be fully aware of. And I'm by no means taken for granted.

02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:38.880
You know, I think I'm, you know, it's the stuff I've done comedy into Tanya and the book I've

02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:45.120
just written is that none of this stuff would make me rich. It would keep me going. The new job

02:06:45.120 --> 02:06:49.040
I've got is going to be a more regular income, which is something I miss. I haven't had this

02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:52.560
since I was a teacher. I missed that. You know, I missed routine and all the rest of it.

02:06:53.440 --> 02:06:58.560
Yeah, well, another complicating factor is not only if you're trying to exist creatively,

02:06:58.560 --> 02:07:06.480
not only is it a very high-risk proposition financially, but you lack that psychological

02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:13.040
comfort that comes from routine, which, you know, people, artistic people often

02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:19.520
are hypercritical of routine, but God, man, routine keeps you sane and trying to invent

02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:24.880
yourself every day. That's not for the faint hearted. I've seen very few people manage that

02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:31.920
successfully across decades. No, absolutely. And I think particularly in comedy, you know,

02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:35.360
because you have to work for about three or four years on the circuit without getting paid anything.

02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:38.400
In fact, you're losing money because you're paying for your travel expenses and then you get

02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:43.360
somewhere and you don't get paid for it. And this is why a lot, you'll find a lot of comedians,

02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:49.120
particularly in the UK, are from quite wealthy backgrounds or privately educated because they

02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:52.640
have rich parents who can help them out, put them up in a flat and they don't have to work

02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:57.600
during the day. And they escalate much quicker through the ranks. But if you come from my sort

02:07:57.600 --> 02:08:02.080
of background, you can't do that. You have to have the job. And then you have to, it's like

02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:07.760
having two jobs. And so you have to really care about it. I mean, my advice is always that I do

02:08:07.760 --> 02:08:14.400
believe, although it comes with that insecurity, if it is a vocation for you, you have to do it.

02:08:14.400 --> 02:08:19.200
I mean, for me, I couldn't have done anything. It is a genuine vocation for me, even if I

02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:24.640
were making no money whatsoever, out of comedy or writing or the rest, I would still be doing it

02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:29.360
because I would feel unfulfilled if I were not doing it. I think there's something also quite,

02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:33.280
I mean, I take your point about the practicalities of living and the business of living. But my

02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:37.760
God, I think depriving yourself of your vocation can be so soul destroying.

02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:43.040
No, it is. Well, I've spent a lot of time studying creativity scientifically. And

02:08:43.760 --> 02:08:50.640
the first thing that's useful to note is that creativity is not common. I mean, everyone

02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:57.440
isn't creative. That's wrong. Some people are very creative. A minority of people are very creative.

02:08:57.440 --> 02:09:02.960
And I mean, it's a continuum, but you don't get, you know, you don't get creativity till you get

02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:07.920
out to the point where what you're doing is original. And that's very difficult. So it's a minority

02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:12.880
proposition. And then of those original people, there's only a tiny fraction that can make a

02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:17.680
successful financial go of it because it's just you have to be creative. Plus, you have to have

02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:22.720
some sense for marketing and sales and business. And you have to be reasonably emotionally stable

02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:30.640
and etc. etc. It's very, very difficult. But if you are creative by temperament, well, that's you.

02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:37.760
To not do that is to not be you. It's like asking an extroverted person not to be around people

02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:43.120
or an agreeable person not to engage in intimate relationships or a conscientious person not to

02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:48.320
be driven by duty. It's like, that's what you're like. And so yeah, you're stuck with it. It's a

02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:55.280
double edged sword creativity. It's vital. It's entrancing. It's necessary. It's transformative.

02:09:55.280 --> 02:10:02.560
It's disruptive. But it's a high risk, high risk, high return game. And the probability of failure is

02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:08.640
overwhelmingly high. Even if you're an entrepreneur and you know, more practically oriented in your

02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:13.520
creativity, the probability that you'll make money from your innovation or your invention

02:10:13.520 --> 02:10:19.280
rather than other people is very, very low. But you need to find a way. I mean, it's also very

02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:23.360
difficult if you're a creative person to a lot of creative people don't think in practical terms.

02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:27.840
They don't think in terms of money. Actually, they're hopeless. A lot of them might I know are

02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:32.240
hopeless. They also tend to be casually contemptuous of that to regard as practical

02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:37.040
concerns is selling out. It's like, you should be bloody happy if you have the opportunity to sell

02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:42.960
out. So I think that the ideal is to find a way to pursue your vocation, but have one eye on the

02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:50.320
reality that you will have to earn money somewhere or another. I mean, yes, I think it's, that's why

02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:54.560
I think I'm lucky. And so far as with Titania, I hit on something that had commercial viability,

02:10:54.560 --> 02:10:59.280
but it was very true to what I desperately wanted to do. And I think that's so rare. I think some

02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:02.480
of the stuff I've written, some of the plays I've written, for instance, I don't think would have

02:11:02.480 --> 02:11:07.280
any commercial success whatsoever. But I wrote them because I needed to write them. And some of

02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:12.000
them didn't even get on. And maybe one day they will. And that would be great. But what you have

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:19.600
to accomplish though, right? You have to have your creative endeavor aligned with market demand at

02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:25.840
exactly that time. It's impossible. It's very, very unlikely. Actually, that's why I always say,

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:31.440
don't attempt to anticipate the zeitgeist because you won't. Like the best thing an artist can do

02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:37.120
is do what they believe and hope because a lot of it is luck. You know what I mean?

02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:41.040
I mean, there's actually, there's a technical literature on that too. I mean, what essentially

02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:45.840
what you do is continue to produce ideas. And it's a Darwinian competition. Essentially,

02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:51.120
they're like life forms, these ideas. And now and then one will find a niche that it can thrive in.

02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:58.400
But the best way to maximize your chance is that that niche will manifest itself is to be,

02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:05.680
is to overproduce. Because look, for I'll give you an example, I answered a bunch of questions on

02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:11.200
Quora. So that's a website where anybody can ask any questions and anybody can answer. I answered

02:12:11.200 --> 02:12:16.560
about 50 when I was playing with Quora. And one of them was a list of everything people should know,

02:12:16.560 --> 02:12:20.000
of things people should know in their life. And I derived my books out of that list.

02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:27.200
It was disproportionately successful. Most of the answers I generated got virtually no views,

02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:31.440
but it got, it must be hundreds of thousands now. But even before I wrote the books, it was tens of

02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:39.360
thousands. But had I not written 50, I wouldn't have got that one. The other 49 failures, so to

02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:46.400
speak, were the answers weren't necessarily worse. They just didn't hit the zeitgeist,

02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:52.000
like that answer did. And I think that's a great piece of advice. Overproduction, because

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:56.400
it's the same with the Beatles. They look like an overnight success. It's because they've been

02:12:56.400 --> 02:13:04.160
playing endlessly in those dingy clubs in Europe. Before it happened, you produce as much as you

02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:10.000
can. They say it takes 10 years to become an overnight success. That's it. Most of the things

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:15.840
I've written have done nothing and gone nowhere and had no success whatsoever. But the one thing,

02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:20.560
occasionally when it hits, that's what sustains all the rest of it. And it's also why creativity

02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:25.440
continues to be selected, let's say, from a biological perspective. It's like, that's why

02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:30.560
I said it was a high risk, high return game. Almost everything you do creatively will fail.

02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:37.200
But now and then, you're disproportionately successful. And so that keeps the whole game going.

02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:41.440
You didn't have any sense, did you, that when you put the lectures on YouTube that it would

02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:49.360
explode in this way? I mean, not in this way. That was completely, I'm still shocked constantly

02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:55.360
by my life. I'm shocked out of sanity by my life. I just can't. This is why I asked you

02:13:55.360 --> 02:14:01.840
about Titania. You get at the center of a whirlwind like that. And there's something very

02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:09.280
surreal about it. And I keep getting hit by surreal things. And it's very hard to wrap

02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:17.120
my head around it. Like this Red Skull episode was just one of many equally surreal occurrences.

02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:26.160
But no, I had no idea. I knew I was working on something important back when I was in my 20s,

02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:31.120
when I wrote my first book. And it was out of that, that all my lectures came. I spent 15 years

02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:36.480
working on that book. And I worked on it about three hours a day. And so I thought about it

02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:42.880
all the time. And so I knew there was something to it, not necessarily because they were my ideas,

02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:48.160
but because of the people who I had read and delved into while I was writing the book. I knew

02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:54.480
the ideas were significant. And I could see the effect of the ideas when I was lecturing on my

02:14:54.480 --> 02:15:01.520
students. So I had some sense that there was something vital, that I was involved in something

02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:06.800
vital. But sure. But had you uploaded those videos a couple of years before or a couple of years

02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:10.560
later, you probably would have missed the zeitgeist and nothing would have happened. I mean, it

02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:14.560
doesn't matter. I always think with any kind of creative endeavor or intellectual endeavor, it

02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:19.360
doesn't matter how good you are in a sense, it has to be good. And the timing has to be right.

02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:23.440
And like you say, if you just keep, I think persistence is it, if you just keep doing it,

02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:29.520
not only does your craft get better and you are, if it does hit, you're in a position to be able to

02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:35.520
no doubt. Look, if you, if you, okay, so in scientific literature, the hallmark of impact

02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:41.040
is citations. And so if your work is cited, it means that someone who's written another scientific

02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:47.760
article makes reference to something you wrote. And that's all tracked and it's used for promotions

02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:54.160
and it's used to judge scientific merit. It's, it's, it's its own science citation tracking.

02:15:54.400 --> 02:16:02.560
A very small number of your published papers accrue most of the citations. So that's the first

02:16:02.560 --> 02:16:07.280
thing. So what that means is the more papers you publish, the more likely it is that one of them

02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:12.720
will become highly cited. And my highly cited papers aren't necessarily the ones that I thought

02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:21.920
would be most impactful. So you, but the other piece of information from literature on creativity

02:16:21.920 --> 02:16:28.160
is that the best predictor of quality, and so you could index quality by impact, let's say,

02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:34.000
or by citations is quantity. Yeah, it's not a great predictor, but it's the best one. And so

02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:38.880
this is a good advice for everyone out there who's a musician or an artist. It's like,

02:16:39.760 --> 02:16:44.000
produce, produce, produce, produce as much as you can, because you do get better at it, right?

02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:50.080
You absolutely do. And, and so there's that, but there's also, I think the other important thing

02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:55.840
is to, to actually be true to yourself in your artistic endeavors, insofar as don't be trying

02:16:55.840 --> 02:16:59.920
to anticipate the desire, guys, don't be trying to anticipate what other people are doing. My big

02:16:59.920 --> 02:17:05.040
concern in the current climate that we live in is that a lot of artists are choosing to self-censor,

02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:11.600
because the penalty for risk taking has got too high. You know, you can be completely, I mean,

02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:15.360
if I think of an example like- Well, think about what kind of catastrophe that is, because we've

02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:20.800
already discussed the fact that the impediments to creativity are almost insurmountable. And so

02:17:20.800 --> 02:17:25.440
then you add an additional one, which is self-censorship because of social pressure. It's like,

02:17:25.440 --> 02:17:30.000
you just decimate the creative enterprise by doing that. We wouldn't have anything. We, we,

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:33.680
the western canon would be decimated. It's ridiculous. I mean, an example I often think of

02:17:33.680 --> 02:17:38.000
is, is one of my favorite playwrights is Edward Albee. And when he came to write his play, The

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:41.600
Goat, which was a very controversial play, because it was about a man having an affair,

02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:45.680
a sexual affair with a goat behind his wife's back. And obviously that doesn't sound palatable.

02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:50.720
Well, at least he went behind his wife's back. Exactly. At least it wasn't sort of an open,

02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:55.920
sort of paganistic thing, absolutely. But I mean, it's, it's a shocking play and it's meant to be.

02:17:55.920 --> 02:18:03.680
It's about where our lines of tolerance are, where they lie and why. And all of his friends told him,

02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:07.840
don't do this. You've got a valuable career, an incredible reputation. You're turning 80. You're

02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:11.120
80. He was roughly 80 years old when this play came out. And they said, you're just going to

02:18:11.120 --> 02:18:16.480
scupper everything. And he said that when he got that response, that's the reason he did it.

02:18:16.480 --> 02:18:20.560
He went out there and he put the play on. And it turned out to be a huge success. It won,

02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:24.400
I think, the Tony Award for best play. It was critically and commercially successful. It was

02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:30.160
absolutely massive. So it just goes to show, I think, to an extent, I mean, I'm not saying disregard

02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:35.040
feedback from other creative people or people who have suggestion. What I am saying is if you're

02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:41.280
true to your muse, whatever that that is, the rewards will come, actually, or they are more

02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:46.720
likely to come. Okay, so that brings us back to free speech too, because, you know, the problem

02:18:46.720 --> 02:18:51.520
with laws that abridge free speech is they abridge creative endeavor. And that's a terrible thing,

02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:57.760
because it's the source of endless renewal. And it's the thing that fixes corrupt structures. And

02:18:57.760 --> 02:19:04.240
so to, to take aim at that is to take aim at the very process that would rescue you from the conundrum

02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:11.680
you are pretending to be obsessed by. I mean, has there been any innovation, not just in artistic

02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:16.400
terms, but in scientific terms, without the risk of offense without, you know, I mentioned the

02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:21.840
example of Galileo in the book, because, you know, he wasn't, he caused a great deal of offense.

02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:28.640
Oh hell, Darwin offended himself so badly that he was sick. He was sick for like a decade because

02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:33.440
of the implications of what he'd thought up, which were thoroughly offensive to himself.

02:19:34.320 --> 02:19:39.360
As they would be, you know, in with his belief system at the time. And, but, but that's, that's

02:19:39.360 --> 02:19:46.400
the, we can see in hindsight, what we would have lost if people weren't willing to risk offending

02:19:46.400 --> 02:19:49.680
others. In fact, even what you said to Kathy Newman in that interview about your risking

02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:54.000
being offensive by disagreeing with me now in this way, like, it's how it's important to risk

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:59.920
offending people. It's because otherwise you just end up in this kind of, you know, this hive mind

02:19:59.920 --> 02:20:06.880
and, and, and for the arts, it becomes utterly stultified. It becomes so boring when, when

02:20:06.880 --> 02:20:12.320
everything is predictable and everything is in line with a viewpoint and no one wants to, you

02:20:12.320 --> 02:20:16.640
know, the art is the best way that we interrogate the complexities of humanity. It's, it's, it's,

02:20:17.680 --> 02:20:22.560
I love what sometimes what the filmmaker Lars von Trier, he said in an interview once that

02:20:22.560 --> 02:20:26.480
sometimes when he's making a film, he will take an indefensible moral position

02:20:26.480 --> 02:20:30.320
and attempt to defend it through the film, which I think is such a fascinating idea.

02:20:30.320 --> 02:20:34.080
Dostoevsky did that all the time in his great novels and so brilliant. I mean,

02:20:34.800 --> 02:20:40.880
that's what, what made Dostoevsky so staggeringly brilliant was he would take positions that he,

02:20:41.680 --> 02:20:48.080
that he despised with all his soul and make the people putting those beliefs forward that

02:20:48.080 --> 02:20:51.360
strongest characters in the book. I mean, he's so brave.

02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:55.760
It's the best thing to do. It's, it's, I wrote a play once where I completely,

02:20:55.760 --> 02:21:01.360
it was a one man play where I completely tried to embody the kind of person I despise. It was

02:21:01.360 --> 02:21:07.920
someone who enjoyed relished watching via acts of violence and he would take a scour the internet

02:21:07.920 --> 02:21:12.080
for clips of real life violence. And it's something I can, you know, whenever I've had that, whenever

02:21:12.080 --> 02:21:16.320
someone's tried to show me a beheading or something, I know I never want to see that kind of thing.

02:21:16.320 --> 02:21:19.600
I know I never want that in my head. And so I wanted to write a character

02:21:19.600 --> 02:21:24.640
who relished it. But from a position, from a non-judgmental position, I've never put that

02:21:24.640 --> 02:21:29.520
play on. I've written it's done. But the act of doing it was so incredibly liberating and

02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:34.160
interesting. And the idea that you can, you know, you keep hearing this all the time,

02:21:35.200 --> 02:21:40.640
you know, whenever a new film or a play comes out of a book, is this sending the right message?

02:21:40.640 --> 02:21:45.440
David Lynch's last series, the latest Twin Peaks series was criticized, I read a review saying,

02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:49.680
well, there's violence against women in this, and he needs to be called out for this. Well,

02:21:49.680 --> 02:21:53.840
representing violence against women isn't an endorsement of violence against women.

02:21:53.840 --> 02:21:56.800
You know, maybe that's what the character does, and maybe we're supposed to hate him for it or

02:21:56.800 --> 02:22:01.600
whatever, you know, and or if you read an autobiography of a complete reprobate,

02:22:01.600 --> 02:22:05.600
there can be something really interesting about that. And imagine all of this gone,

02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:11.040
all of this potential. But that is the end point of that's why I believe that this this current

02:22:11.040 --> 02:22:16.800
social justice ideology is anti art. I think it's it's opposed to the the artistic spirit,

02:22:16.800 --> 02:22:22.000
quite quite fundamentally opposed to it, which is why I feel we must push back against it.

02:22:23.360 --> 02:22:28.560
So that's a great place to end. No, no, that's great. That's great. Well, thanks a lot.

02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:34.800
Yeah, much appreciated. It was a pleasure. And the time flew by, which is a good marker of a

02:22:35.360 --> 02:22:41.600
engaging exchange of free speech, let's say. Absolutely. Thanks so much for having me, Jordan.

02:22:41.600 --> 02:22:50.720
My pleasure. Good luck. Thank you.
