00:00.000 --> 00:08.260
Hi all, it is of course completely presumptuous of me to dare to write and broadcast a video

00:08.260 --> 00:13.760
entitled Message to the Christian Churches, but I'm going to do it anyway because I have

00:13.760 --> 00:19.960
something to say and because that something needs to be said.

00:19.960 --> 00:25.320
I've been speaking to and watching and listening to audiences all over the Western world for

00:25.320 --> 00:33.720
the past four years, in person and in virtual form, and have learned a few things in consequence.

00:33.720 --> 00:39.960
It all started in some sense with the lectures I did on Genesis in 2017.

00:39.960 --> 00:45.880
My family and I took a risk and rented out a theatre in Toronto on the off chance that

00:45.880 --> 00:50.560
there might be an audience for what might be described as a psychological approach to

00:50.560 --> 00:58.160
our ancient stories and, lo and behold, and Miracle of Miracles, there was.

00:58.160 --> 01:06.200
I completed 15 or so lectures walking through the first Biblical book, sold out the theatre,

01:06.200 --> 01:15.440
and attracted, surprisingly, millions of viewers, Christians, Jews, Muslims, and atheists,

01:15.440 --> 01:21.200
and most of the people who attended lives, and the majority of those who watched online

01:21.200 --> 01:23.260
were young men.

01:23.260 --> 01:30.660
That is not a phenomenon that can be easily accounted for, but let me try.

01:30.660 --> 01:37.640
Now in the West, because of the weight of historical guilt that is upon us, a variant of the sense

01:37.640 --> 01:44.720
of original sin in a very real sense, and because of a very real attempt by those possessed

01:44.720 --> 01:51.200
by what might be described as unhelpful ideas to weaponize that guilt, our young people

01:51.200 --> 01:56.260
face a demoralization that is perhaps unparalleled.

01:56.260 --> 02:03.180
This is particularly true of young men, although anything that devastates young men will eventually

02:03.180 --> 02:06.080
do the same to young women.

02:06.080 --> 02:13.100
And that, in this era of anti-natalism and equally reprehensible nihilism, is precisely

02:13.100 --> 02:14.980
the point.

02:14.980 --> 02:21.140
When they are children, boys are hectic for their toy preferences, which often include

02:21.140 --> 02:26.420
toy weapons such as guns, and they're more boisterous playing style, as boys require

02:26.420 --> 02:32.700
active rough-and-tumble play, even more than girls, for whom it is also a necessity.

02:32.700 --> 02:39.020
When in grade school, boys are admonished, shamed, and controlled in a very similar manner

02:39.220 --> 02:44.420
By those who think that play is unnecessary, particularly if it's competitive, and who

02:44.420 --> 02:53.900
value a docile, harmless obedience above all, shades of Dolores Umbridge, following all

02:53.900 --> 03:01.500
that, because that's not enough, even when pursued assiduously for total demoralization,

03:01.500 --> 03:07.580
is the inculcation of an extremely damaging ideology, which essentially consists of three

03:08.340 --> 03:10.180
accusations.

03:10.180 --> 03:16.900
Number one, human culture, particularly in the West, is best construed as an oppressive

03:16.900 --> 03:24.900
patriarchy, motivated by the desire, willingness, and ability to use power, defined as the compulsion

03:24.900 --> 03:31.180
of others against their will, to attain what our purely selfish and self-serving ends.

03:31.180 --> 03:35.300
This is true at every level of analysis.

03:35.300 --> 03:41.060
Marriage is akin to slavery, friendship to exploitation, political disagreement to war,

03:41.060 --> 03:45.780
and business arrangements to deception and theft.

03:45.780 --> 03:51.180
And this is true not only of the current social arrangements that characterize our culture,

03:51.180 --> 03:58.460
particularly in the West, but also the fundamental reality of history itself.

03:58.460 --> 04:06.340
Number two, human activity, particularly that undertaken in the West, is fundamentally

04:06.340 --> 04:09.580
a planet-disspoiling enterprise.

04:09.580 --> 04:14.900
The human race is a threat to the ecological utopia that existed before us, and that could

04:14.900 --> 04:18.660
hypothetically exist in our absence.

04:18.660 --> 04:24.380
We might well be construed even as a cancer that threatens the very viability of the complex

04:24.380 --> 04:31.100
systems that make up the ecosystem of the Earth that shelters and supports us.

04:31.100 --> 04:37.220
We are facing a Malthusian catastrophe of overpopulation and biosphere degradation.

04:37.220 --> 04:43.380
And we have to place extreme limits on our wants, even our needs, so that survival itself,

04:43.380 --> 04:49.500
even in a much reduced form, can be guaranteed.

04:49.500 --> 04:56.060
Number three, the prime contributor both to the tyranny that makes up the oppressive patriarchy

04:56.060 --> 05:02.420
and structures all of our social interactions, past and present, and the unforgivable dispoiling

05:02.420 --> 05:08.460
of our beloved Mother Earth is damnable male ambition, competitive and dominating,

05:08.460 --> 05:14.540
power-mad, selfish, exploitative, raping and pillaging.

05:14.540 --> 05:18.060
You might think that I'm overstating the case.

05:18.060 --> 05:20.380
Think again, sunshine.

05:20.380 --> 05:26.900
We in the West are facing an all-out assault at the deepest levels on what that old Joker

05:26.900 --> 05:34.800
Jacques Derrida deemed the foul, logo-centric conceptual structure of civilization itself.

05:34.800 --> 05:41.780
To take that apart, that's a society centered on the encouraging, adventurous, masculine

05:41.780 --> 05:49.020
spirit and that privileges that hated word of all things, the divine logos.

05:49.020 --> 05:55.540
And what should we worship and celebrate properly other than that, deconstructionists, the words

05:55.540 --> 05:59.460
of that mass murderer Karl Marx?

05:59.460 --> 06:04.020
And it is precisely those young men who are deeply conscientious, capable of guilt and

06:04.020 --> 06:10.300
regret, who have come to believe in pain that every deep impulse that moves them out into

06:10.300 --> 06:16.540
the world for the adventure of their life, even that impulse drawing them to women, is

06:16.540 --> 06:23.100
nothing but the manifestation of a spirit that is essentially satanic in nature.

06:23.100 --> 06:30.980
This is not only wrong, theologically, morally, psychologically, practically and scientifically.

06:30.980 --> 06:33.180
It is literally anti-true.

06:33.180 --> 06:39.900
It's not a mere misstatement about the nature of reality, a minor conceptual error, but

06:39.900 --> 06:46.060
something that literally could not be farther from the truth, and something that distant

06:46.060 --> 06:52.860
from the truth comes from a place that cannot be distinguished from hell.

06:52.860 --> 06:58.340
The Christian Church is there to remind people, young men included, and perhaps even first

06:58.340 --> 07:05.260
and foremost, that they have a woman to find, a garden to walk in, a family to nurture,

07:05.260 --> 07:12.060
an ark to build, a land to conquer, a ladder to heaven to build, and the utter terrible

07:12.060 --> 07:23.260
catastrophe of life to face stalwartly in truth devoted to love and without fear.

07:23.260 --> 07:26.180
Invite the young men back.

07:26.180 --> 07:33.980
Say literally to those young men, you are welcome here if no one else wants what you

07:33.980 --> 07:35.900
have to offer.

07:35.900 --> 07:37.180
We do.

07:37.180 --> 07:40.460
We want to call you to the highest purpose of your life.

07:40.460 --> 07:46.420
We want your time and energy and effort and your will and your goodwill.

07:46.420 --> 07:53.980
We want to work with you to make things better, to produce life more abundant for you and

07:53.980 --> 08:00.340
for your wife and children and for your community and your country and the world.

08:00.340 --> 08:02.100
And we have our problems.

08:02.100 --> 08:08.740
In the Christian Church, we are more abundant, sometimes far too often corrupt, and sometimes

08:08.740 --> 08:09.900
deeply so.

08:09.900 --> 08:16.260
We are outdated, as are all institutions with their roots in the dead, but still often wise

08:16.260 --> 08:17.820
past.

08:17.820 --> 08:20.740
So join us.

08:20.740 --> 08:29.420
We'll help fix you up, and you can help fix us up, and together we'll aim up.

08:29.420 --> 08:34.420
But here is a message to those young men skeptical about such things.

08:34.420 --> 08:36.780
What else do you have?

08:36.780 --> 08:40.420
You can abandon the churches in your cynicism and disbelief.

08:40.420 --> 08:45.300
You can say to yourself, narcissistically and solipsistically, the church does not express

08:45.300 --> 08:49.500
what I believe properly.

08:49.500 --> 08:52.180
Who cares what you believe?

08:52.180 --> 08:54.700
Why is this about you?

08:54.700 --> 08:58.420
Do you even want it to be about you?

08:58.420 --> 09:00.100
What if it was about others?

09:00.100 --> 09:05.400
What if it was about your duty to the past and to the broader community that surrounds

09:05.400 --> 09:07.980
you in the present?

09:07.980 --> 09:13.860
What if it was incumbent upon you and vital to your health and willingness even to live

09:13.860 --> 09:19.860
to rescue your dead father from the belly of the beast, where he has always resided,

09:19.860 --> 09:23.220
and to restore him to life?

09:23.220 --> 09:32.340
Once again to the churches, Protestant, you're the worst at the moment, Catholic, Orthodox.

09:32.340 --> 09:40.220
Invite young men, put up a billboard, say, young men are welcome here.

09:40.220 --> 09:43.980
Print some flyers and put them in a box by the billboard.

09:43.980 --> 09:48.820
Signal the existence of those flyers with an arrow, with the words, more information

09:48.820 --> 09:51.940
about attending here.

09:51.940 --> 09:56.820
Tell those who have never been in a church exactly what to do, how to dress, when to

09:56.820 --> 10:04.940
show up, who to contact, and most importantly, what they can do.

10:04.940 --> 10:09.620
Ask more, not less of those you are inviting.

10:09.620 --> 10:13.580
Ask more of them than anyone ever has.

10:13.580 --> 10:21.580
Remind them who they are in the deepest sense and help them become that.

10:21.580 --> 10:26.740
For churches, for God's sake, quit fighting for social justice.

10:26.740 --> 10:30.620
Quit saving the bloody planet.

10:30.620 --> 10:32.980
Attend to some souls.

10:32.980 --> 10:35.340
That's what you're supposed to do.

10:35.340 --> 10:38.100
That's your holy duty.

10:38.100 --> 10:43.340
Do it now, before it's too late.

10:43.340 --> 10:45.020
The hour is nigh.
