00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,920
Andrew Doyle is with me today. Andrew is a British comedian, playwright, journalist,

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,040
political satirist and author who co-created the fictional character Jonathan Pye and the equally

3
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,280
or perhaps even more fictional character Titania McGrath. He recently published his first book,

4
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:51,040
Free Speech, Why It Matters, which came out in 2021, but previously published two more

5
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:58,960
as the aforementioned Titania McGrath. The first of those was Woke, a guide to social justice

6
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,600
published in 2019. And the second was my first little book of intersectional activism published

7
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:13,360
in 2020. I haven't met Andrew before. I'm looking forward to talking with him about Free Speech and

8
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,800
about his satire and about the intersection between those two and whatever else comes up.

9
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,040
Thank you very much for coming on today. I'm looking forward to speaking with you.

10
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,160
Thanks so much for having me.

11
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,840
So, shall we start perhaps with the discussion of your book? I finished it yesterday.

12
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,920
I've become notorious, I suppose, for my particular take on Free Speech. And so,

13
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:45,120
it was a book that interested me. Tell me why you wrote it and what you learned and all of those

14
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,720
things. Well, it's not the sort of book I ever envisaged that I would have to write. I think

15
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,360
if you go back 10, 15 years, the idea that Free Speech, which is obviously the seedbed

16
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,680
of all our liberties, would be something that we would have to defend, would have probably

17
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,600
seemed a little bit ridiculous to me because I basically took it for granted. I thought that

18
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,000
everyone was on that side. But I fear that something has happened, particularly over the

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,480
past 10 years or so. And it is connected, I feel, with the rise of this social justice movement,

20
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,920
what we might call critical social justice, or however we want to call it. A lot of people call

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,680
it the woke movement. However you want to label that ideology, which at its heart has a real

22
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,120
mistrust of Free Speech. And you hear it all the time in the kind of phrases that the activists use,

23
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,360
phrases like words are violence or this kind of language normalizes hate or legitimizes hate or

24
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,280
all this kind of thing. And there's a real genuine mistrust of the power of language to effectively

25
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,080
corrupt the masses. And what I wanted to do, I suppose, was try and marshal a defence

26
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,560
for this principle that I had always taken for granted. But at the same time, attempt to grapple

27
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,520
with the concerns that people might have. Because my worry with the culture war, as we call it,

28
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,480
is that you have two sort of extreme polls arguing against each other. And most people

29
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,040
are caught in the middle. I think most people are broadly for the idea of Free Speech, but they

30
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,040
have a few reservations, for instance, when it comes to demagogues espousing hate or hate against

31
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,040
a particular minority group or something like that. Or people are concerned about the ways in which

32
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,280
language can cause harm. And I don't think anyone would deny that words can be hurtful. So most

33
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,880
people, I think, are somewhere in between and are open to persuasion. And I think my point,

34
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,880
my principal argument in the book, is that absolute freedom of speech is always going to be

35
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,720
better. And in fact, by promoting free speech, you're doing something to help those very people

36
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:53,200
that you are concerned about. So recently, the Scottish Parliament passed a hate crime law

37
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:01,360
that has its supporters and also its detractors. And I'd be interested in your feeling about that.

38
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,520
Now, you said, I believe in this book, if I remember the statistics correctly, that

39
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:15,600
there have been 120,000 incidents of police investigated speech hate crime in Britain in

40
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,120
how long? That's been over the last five years or so?

41
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:27,600
It's worse than that. The statistic, I quote, is between 2014 and 2019, there are 120,000 recorded

42
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,720
incidents of non-crime. They call them non-crime hate incidents. And this is something which is

43
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,600
now routine in the UK. I mean, obviously, I'm going to be talking about the UK and the US and

44
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,000
Canada is a very different kettle of fish, I'm sure. And I'm sure a lot of the people who are

45
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,840
watching won't be familiar with the problems we have in the UK. Of course, we don't have

46
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,240
constitutional protection for free speech. We don't have a First Amendment. We don't have anything

47
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,440
like that. So we are particularly vulnerable. And at the moment, unfortunately, in the UK,

48
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,880
the police who are trained by the College of Policing who do issue very specific guidelines

49
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,120
about this. And anyone can check this because if you go to the government's website on hate crime

50
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,840
and hate speech, they make very clear what they're talking about. What they say is that there are five

51
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,120
protected characteristics and these fall into race, gender, sexuality, gender identity and

52
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,840
disability. I think I might misquote that, but there's one missing. But anyway, there are five

53
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,000
protected characteristics. And if a victim, and they do use the word victim rather than complainant,

54
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,440
if a victim perceives that any speech or crime was motivated by hatred towards any of those

55
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,960
five protected characteristics, then it qualifies as a hate crime if it's criminal. If it's not

56
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,920
criminal, if it's just speech or something like that, it qualifies as a non-crime hate incident.

57
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,960
Police will investigate that. They will record that. And although non-crime incidents don't

58
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,000
lead to prosecution, they do go on a criminal reference check that many people take. We call it

59
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,320
disclosure and barring service here. So it can affect your employment prospects.

60
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,720
And is that without a trial? That's recorded without a trial?

61
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,480
Of course. So you get a quasi-criminal record.

62
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,680
You get something flagged up, particularly if you're applying for a teaching job,

63
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,160
say something like that where you're working with children, it's very important. And you get

64
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,360
this thing flagged up. So it does have serious ramifications. But even beyond that, we have

65
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,560
hate speech laws which are encoded into the Public Order Act, which is one example. But the

66
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,720
main example is the Electronic Communications Act 2003. In this country, and I do quote the

67
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:37,520
statistic in the book as well, we have roughly 3,000 people arrested a year for offensive things

68
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,720
that they have said online. So in other words, nine people a day, roughly, the police in the UK

69
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,200
are arresting. And people in the UK will be familiar with this, because if you see the Twitter

70
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,960
accounts of various police forces, various police departments across the country, they often put

71
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,800
things out like, you know, make sure you don't say anything offensive or thoughtless online,

72
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,400
or we will be knocking on your door. They say these very kind of frightening things. There was a

73
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:07,200
recent police display outside a supermarket in the UK. It went viral, this image. It was them

74
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,360
next to a big digital billboard. And the slogan on the billboard was being offensive is an offense.

75
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,520
And this was flanked by police officers who were socially distanced, but they were there and their

76
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,880
masks, which made it seem slightly more sinister. They got in a lot of trouble for that, because

77
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,520
people were saying, well, being offensive surely isn't a crime. But actually, the problem with

78
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,360
that is that the police clearly thought it was a crime. And they, you know, they were acting on

79
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,600
that basis. They'd obviously hadn't just concocted this billboard out of nothing, they'd really

80
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,040
considered what it should say. And more to the point, actually, they were right. In this country,

81
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:47,520
you can go to prison for jokes, for offensive remarks. And people have gone to prison,

82
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,680
have been arrested routinely for causing offense. And of course, the notion of offense

83
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,120
is incredibly subjective. In fact, in fact, the legal stipulation in the communications act

84
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,120
is that you will have broken the law if the judge and jury deem that you have

85
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,560
communicated material that is quote unquote, grossly offensive. Well, I don't know how you

86
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,280
define that. I wouldn't know. And also, who defines it is the real question, as far as I'm

87
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,880
concerned. I mean, I've looked into this legislation to some degree. And one of the things that struck

88
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:26,560
me about it was that it seems to be purposefully left up to the hypothetical victim to define

89
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:34,560
offense, which has become a subjective reality. And you can understand why that might be to some

90
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,880
degree, because how would you define hate? And how would you define offense without, especially

91
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,840
the latter, without making recourse to someone's subjective experience? But then, of course,

92
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,760
well, we'll delve into that in a moment. I should start with the hard question, I suppose, which is,

93
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,240
well, clearly, people can say hateful things. And those things can be damaging psychologically and

94
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,280
physiologically, I suppose, if people are stressed enough. And the borderline is very

95
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:11,200
difficult to identify. Why is it that people shouldn't just assume that you're a mean loudmouth and

96
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,800
that they shouldn't pay any attention to you at all, because you're concerned about this?

97
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:23,040
I mean, which is that's the general criticism of critics of hate speech, let's say. And so,

98
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,160
why in the world aren't we aren't the people who are putting this forward just trying to make the

99
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,840
world a nicer place? What's the big problem here? Well, I think a lot of people do assume that I'm a

100
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:40,560
mean loudmouth. I think they assume that about most people who defend freedom of speech. And I'm sure

101
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,960
the latter part of your question is absolutely right. Insofar as I imagine a lot of the people

102
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,120
who are skeptical about free speech are, in fact, trying to make the world a better place. I don't

103
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,960
think that's mutually exclusive. I mean, the problem here is that the legislation as it currently

104
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,160
stands here means that, for instance, if you say something critical about me, and I perceive

105
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,360
that it was motivated by hatred towards me on the basis of my sexuality, for instance, I could phone

106
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,160
the police and that would be recorded and would appear on hate crime statistics in this in this

107
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,720
country, because it's all about perception. That word is used about five or six times within the

108
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,960
one passage in the in the hate crime legislation, the word perception of the victim. And again,

109
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,680
I say victim, not complainant, which suggests a complete disregard for due process. But I suppose

110
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,640
we can leave that aside. But the most common, the most common and the most frightening misconception

111
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,840
I have found when it comes to people defending free speech is that they are doing so because they

112
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:40,000
want to have the right to say appalling things about people with no comeback whatsoever. And

113
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,880
they want to go back to some imaginary good old days, you know, where you could just be casually

114
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,760
homophobic and racist and sexist and all the rest of it. And no one would call you out for that.

115
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,200
Now, I don't know anyone who falls into that category. And most people who are,

116
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,720
you know, advocating for free speech are doing so precisely because they are aware

117
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,520
that in countries where free speech protections are meager, minorities tend to suffer the most.

118
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:09,440
And in fact, there is a it seems to be a corollary to me that those who are genuinely

119
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,240
for free speech are also for equal rights and protecting the vulnerable in society. And this

120
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,080
perception, which I really find unpleasant, this perception that if you are standing up for this

121
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,120
most foundational of principles of freedom of speech, if you're standing up for that,

122
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,600
you can only be doing so if you have a nefarious motive. I mean, what a horribly pessimistic

123
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,160
view of humanity. And it seems to be... Well, it seems to be a direct derivation of the hypothesis,

124
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:46,960
for example, that all Western social organizations, particularly Western, are based on power and

125
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:53,680
are best conceived of as tyrannical. And so if that's your view, why would you not assume that

126
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,360
most use of speech is essentially an exercise of power in the service of tyranny?

127
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,000
But then why would you assume that the government in control of any particular

128
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,840
country isn't part of that tyranny that you're describing? It seems odd to me to be

129
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,760
mindful of the potential for tyranny, but then to outsource all your individual liberties to the

130
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,920
state. It seems contradictory to me. Well, I guess the way that that is

131
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:28,320
elided over is by allowing the hypothetical individual victim to define the offense.

132
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,760
This is the problem, though. I mean, the problem I've run into, and this is partly why I appreciated

133
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:41,120
your book, is that increasingly, people are called upon to defend fundamental assumptions

134
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:49,120
that were so taken for granted that virtually no one has an argument that's fully articulated at hand.

135
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,280
When no one questions free speech, no one has to defend it thoroughly. As soon as it's questioned,

136
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:02,400
well, it becomes an extraordinarily complicated problem. The same with gender identity. When

137
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,840
no one's paying attention to it, it's obvious, but as soon as you have to think it through,

138
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:13,040
it becomes a rat's nest to say the least. When I was in the UK a few years ago, I saw a number

139
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:20,960
of things that I felt were disturbing. People seem to have accepted the omnipresence of CCTV

140
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:28,080
cameras to a degree that I found horrifying. Frankly, I don't like CCTV cameras. I don't like

141
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:35,200
the message they portray, which is that everyone is criminal enough so they should be

142
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,680
surveyed all the time and someone needs to be watching. I noticed, too, in London in particular,

143
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:49,840
that many buildings had instituted airport-level security so that you had to pass through a

144
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,080
metal detector and have your bags checked, et cetera, while you were moving in and out of

145
00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:00,880
buildings. It struck me as quite horrifying given that, as far as I'm concerned, Great Britain and

146
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:08,320
its legal and parliamentary traditions are at the epicenter of Western freedoms. I mean,

147
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,880
you could make a case for France, I suppose, but not a strong one, as far as I'm concerned.

148
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:22,000
Your citizens seem to have accepted this with virtually no problem. Now, on the heels of that,

149
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,840
we have this multiplication of hate crime. That's as much a surprise to me as it is to you.

150
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,800
You won't have seen all of the CCTV cameras believe. Apparently, they're absolutely everywhere. You

151
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:41,280
can't walk anywhere in the UK without being potentially monitored. I'm not saying someone's

152
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:46,480
watching you all the time, but things are being recorded and digitized. It's interesting to me,

153
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,040
because I remember back in the early 2000s, when the government was trying to push through its ID

154
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,640
card scheme and, broadly speaking, the left were unanimously against it. They didn't like this idea

155
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,960
of living in a society where there's someone on the corner saying, papers, please. No one really

156
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:07,120
wanted that. But we've become very docile and very accepting of the idea that we need to be

157
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,560
coddled and monitored by the state. I mean, I know there's a recent debate about vaccine

158
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,880
passports, and people seem very blasé about this idea that we might have to have our ID

159
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,520
embedded and encoded onto a card to get anywhere or to do anything. I think there's

160
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,280
something going on there and it is connected with what you've brought up in terms of hate

161
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,840
crime legislation. We've just become accustomed. I mean, you mentioned specifically the problem in

162
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:35,360
Scotland. And seriously, it relates very closely to what you're saying, because the SMP, who are the

163
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,040
only really party with any clout in Scotland, that's the Scottish National Party. And it's never a

164
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,240
good idea, is it, when you have one political party, which doesn't really have an opposition.

165
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:50,160
They have a reputation for quite nanny, statious policies. They introduced a,

166
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,160
what was it called, the named person scheme. It didn't go through in the end, but they wanted to

167
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,280
assign every child born in Scotland with a state guardian. They effectively didn't trust

168
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,480
the parents to raise their own kids. They have other examples, minimum pricing on alcohol or

169
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,280
ban on two-for-one pizzas, because they don't trust poor people not to gain weight. So all

170
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,320
sorts of these sorts of policies. But in this current hate crime bill, which has just sailed

171
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,120
through because there's no opposition, Humza Youssef, the justice secretary, has pushed through,

172
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,920
he specifically included an element to this bill, which says that they can criminalize you for things

173
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:30,160
you say in the privacy of your own home. I mean, that's just a given. I would have never thought

174
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,120
that anyone in this country would not consider that to be an incredible invasion on individual

175
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:42,400
liberty. You can make a strong case for Scotland as the ground zero for many of the, developing

176
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:48,400
many of the concepts that undergird the entire Western notion of freedom. And to see that emerging

177
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,120
in Scotland is absolutely stunningly terrifying, as far as I'm concerned.

178
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,480
Think of Mill Gibson with a face covered in woad shouting freedom as he's executed in that

179
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,560
in Braveheart. You do think of Scotland as being associated with it, but honestly,

180
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,520
Scotland for some reason, and I don't know what it is, and it might be to do that it's

181
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,480
effectively this one party state, it seems to have this incredible sense. And they've really

182
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,240
brought into this idea that unless they can police the thought and speech of their citizens,

183
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,560
then they will just run a run a mock. It's there's another element to that bill. I don't

184
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,000
know if you know about this. There's a specific element on the bill, which talks about the public

185
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,080
performance of a play. So they've effectively said that they will criminalize public performances.

186
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,200
So say if it can be deemed that those performances were designed to stir up hatred, that's the

187
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,080
formulation stir up hatred. I'm not quite sure what that means necessarily. But the when when

188
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,800
Humza Yousef was questioned about this in parliament, he actually said, well, theoretically a neo Nazi

189
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,440
or someone from the far right could get together with a group of actors and put on a play to to

190
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,400
recruit people to his cause. And as I said at the time, you know, I don't know any neo Nazis,

191
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,240
but they're not into amateur dramatics. That's not their thing. They don't do that. They wouldn't

192
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,240
get involved. And yet he's got this idea in his head that that is a feasible. I mean, it seems

193
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,320
ridiculous. But it's not really because the ramifications are quite a quite serious. And

194
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,520
the way it's just gone through without any opposition really, really troubles me. I mean,

195
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,160
there have been modifications, I should say, in fairness. In the initial bill in the initial

196
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,960
draft of the bill, they had said that you could be criminalized irrespective of intention. In

197
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,160
other words, yes, if that was terrifying, awful. And you know, if you wrote a play that then

198
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,160
stimulated someone to join the far right, then you were still responsible whether you intended

199
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,760
it or not. Now the problem is, you know, with theatrical representation or any kind of artistic

200
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,840
representation is sometimes you want to represent the worst aspects of humanity.

201
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,640
Because that's part of drama and literature and all the rest of it. I mean, you would be,

202
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,080
there would be no artistic freedom if that went through. So fortunately,

203
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,800
that element of the bill was modified. Well, and also the attempt to reverse the idea that intent

204
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:59,760
is important is that's even that's even more catastrophic. It's always been a miracle to me

205
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:07,120
that our legal system ever became psychologically sophisticated enough so that intent rather than

206
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:13,440
outcome was what mattered. Because you have to be a sophisticated thinker to see that someone has

207
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:20,640
done damage to someone else. But and so the damage is real and market and troublesome and costly,

208
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:28,000
all of that painful. But because the intent wasn't there, the severity of the action is

209
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,640
dramatically mitigated. That's a sign of maturity and sophistication to note that. And the fact

210
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,000
that it's built into the legal system is nothing short of remarkable. And then to remove that and to

211
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:46,000
make the felt consequences, the arbiter of the reality of the situation is

212
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,320
a dreadful assault on the integrity of the law as such, as far as I can tell.

213
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,280
Well, moreover, it's something that everyone intuitively understands. We all understand

214
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,360
the difference between murder and manslaughter. You know, we all understand that intent actually

215
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:06,240
does, like you say, escalate the severity of a crime. And it's bigger than that, isn't it?

216
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,480
Because this idea that intention doesn't matter is actually built into

217
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,520
so much of this what we call social justice discourse. If you think of critical race theory,

218
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,400
it's just a given that there are racist structures and you can be racist without

219
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,800
intending to be racist. And I really do dispute that, because I think in order to be racist,

220
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,160
intention has to be at the heart of that. Otherwise, it's incoherent to me. But this is really

221
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:37,440
a degraded view of humanity, I feel, where we are effectively like marionettes,

222
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,000
and that we're just being played, and that we don't have any agency anymore. And therefore,

223
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,680
we can't be responsible for our own words, not just our actions. We can't be responsible for our

224
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,400
own words and the ramifications. So we have to be controlled and we have to be stifled by the

225
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:03,840
state. And it makes me very nervous. So I've been thinking through the importance of free speech,

226
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,920
I suppose, from a psychological perspective. And it seems to me that, well, we can walk

227
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:15,360
through some axioms and you can tell me what you think about them, if you would. So I mean,

228
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,760
the first thing we might posit is that it's useful to think. It's better to think than not to think.

229
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,440
That might seem self-evident, but thought can be troublesome and stir up trouble,

230
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:36,160
and your thoughts can be inaccurate. So it's perhaps not that unreasonable to start the questioning

231
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:45,200
there. But I think it was Alfred North-Whitehead who said that thinking allows our thoughts to die

232
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:53,760
instead of us. And so he was thinking about the evolution of thought in some sense from a biological

233
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,600
perspective. So imagine a creature that's incapable of thought has to act something out,

234
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,520
a representation of the world or an intent. It has to be embodied. And then if that fails,

235
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:12,160
well, it fails in action. And so the consequence of that might be death. It might be very severe.

236
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:19,840
Whereas once you can think, you can represent the world abstractly, you can divorce the

237
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:26,480
abstraction from the world, and then you can produce avatars of yourself, sometimes in the

238
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,840
image like in dreams, let's say, or in literature and fiction and movies and so on, produce avatars

239
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:39,360
of ourselves that are fictional, and then run them as simulations in the abstract world and

240
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:46,880
observe the consequences. And we do that in our stories. We do that when we dream. We do that when

241
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:54,400
we imagine in images and depict a dramatic scenario playing itself out. But then we also do that in

242
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,000
words because we encode those images. It's one more level of abstraction. We encode those images

243
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,640
into words, and those words become partial dramatic avatars, and then the words can battle

244
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,880
with one another. So thought seems to work, let's say verbal thought. You ask yourself a question.

245
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,760
You receive an answer in some mysterious manner. There's an internal revelation of sorts. That's

246
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,120
the spontaneous thought. When you sit down to write a book, thoughts come to you, perhaps because

247
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,240
you pose yourself a question. And no one knows how that works, but we experience it, that thoughts

248
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,040
manifest themselves in the theater of our imagination. So that's the revelatory aspect. And then

249
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:40,560
there's the critical aspect, which is, well, now you've thought this and perhaps you've written it

250
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:47,120
down. Can you generate counter positions? Are there universes that you can imagine where this

251
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,800
doesn't apply? Are there situations where it doesn't apply? Are there better ways of formulating that

252
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:59,680
thought? But I would say with regard to critical thought, and to some degree with regard to productive

253
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:09,440
thought, an indeterminate proportion of that is dependent on speech. I don't think it's unreasonable

254
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:16,080
to point out that thought is internalized speech, and that the dialectical process that constitutes

255
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,840
critical thinking is internalized speech. So you and I are engaging in a dialectic enterprise.

256
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:28,160
You'll pause at something and I'll respond to it and you'll respond to that. And we're in a kind

257
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:34,480
of combat. There's some cooperation about it as well. And we're attempting to formulate a truth

258
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,000
more clearly, at least in principle, if we're being honest. We do that when we're speaking.

259
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,560
So our thought, the quality of our thought is actually dependent on our ability to speak

260
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:50,160
our minds. Absolutely. And then, so go ahead. Well, I couldn't agree more because I think

261
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,920
speech is the way in which we collaborate on our thoughts. That's how it works. You

262
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,920
refine those thought processes that you've described. I mean, I'm no psychologist, but I

263
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:05,680
understand this basic premise that we have these various thoughts that are continually in conflict

264
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,640
within ourselves, unless we're able to articulate them and to engage in others through that process,

265
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,720
through that transactional process of speech, then those thoughts are never refined and they

266
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:20,080
remain in this kind of infancy. And this is why- Yes, well, they're as refined as we can make them

267
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,040
as individuals. But that's also assuming that you even have the words, which you also learned

268
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:30,400
in the dialectical process. Right, exactly. It's not as though the truth is ever fully graspable,

269
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,240
but we can get nearer to it through that collaborative process of speaking and

270
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,320
articulating the thoughts. And in fact, even in the act of, like you say, writing or articulating

271
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,360
yourself, with your self-authoring program, for instance, the act of writing things out

272
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:50,080
is what clarifies the points of view for you. I've actually found that the way that I think

273
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,640
about these issues now is largely a product of the fact that I've written so much about it.

274
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:00,640
And changed my mind through the act of learning how to express myself on these points. And the

275
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:07,520
consequence of not having that opportunity, I think, is something I would barely want to

276
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:14,640
contemplate. And I think to give an example of the moment, which is that because any kind of

277
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,600
attempt to have a discussion or debate about the perceived conflict between trans rights and gender

278
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,560
critical feminism, because to even attempt that discussion at the moment will have such

279
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:30,640
grave social consequences. And certainly in terms of career prospects, major consequences,

280
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,600
people will not have that discussion. I have people I know in politics, in the media, and they

281
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:41,200
say to me quite honestly, I will not talk about this. I have concerns, I have qualms, I want answers

282
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,520
to questions, but I absolutely will not open my mouth about this. And if you don't do that,

283
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,120
that this is why no one understands the issue. This is why no one has reached any kind of consensus

284
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,960
on this issue. All we have is a sense in which to have the quote unquote wrong opinion makes you a

285
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,520
pariah. And therefore I better not have that opinion. Well, then that's not a sincerely held

286
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:07,520
conviction. That's just that's just if the definition of wrong is continually transforming

287
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,240
and in an unpredictable manner, then it's best just to sidestep the issue entirely. And then

288
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:17,440
that leaves it murky and ill defined and assuming that you believe that thought has any utility.

289
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,400
And so when you're sitting down to write, when I'm sitting down to write,

290
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,760
and I produce a sentence, you know, it might have come from some theoretical perspective,

291
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,640
maybe I'm approaching something from a Freudian perspective or a Marxist perspective or a

292
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:39,040
enlightenment perspective, etc. I mean, it's a psychological trope, I suppose, that

293
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,880
we all think the thoughts of dead philosophers, right? We think we have our own opinions, but

294
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,160
that's really very, very, very, very rarely the case. It's not that easy to come up with something

295
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:56,800
truly original and generally make incremental progress at best. And so your ability to abstractly

296
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:02,880
represent the world and then to generate avatars that can be defeated without you dying is dependent

297
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,640
on your incorporation of a multitude of opinions. And that in itself is a consequence of

298
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,560
I mean, that works to the degree that communication is actually free and that you can get access to

299
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:20,080
as much thought as you can possibly manage. So I can't see how you can deny the centrality

300
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,360
of free speech as a fundamental right or the fundamental right, perhaps,

301
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:32,800
unless you simultaneously deny the utility of thought. But maybe if you are also inclined to

302
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:41,440
remove the individual from the central position of the political discourse, then maybe you can also

303
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:49,200
make the case at least implicitly that individual thought doesn't matter and that mostly it's just

304
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,400
causing trouble. But I think individual thought is key. And actually, even in the outline you've

305
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:00,160
described there, there is individual agency in reaching a conclusion that has been articulated

306
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,240
before insofar as if you are engaged with a multitude of writers and philosophers and

307
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,400
artists and ideas and you've come out with a perspective. Well, that perspective may not

308
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:13,040
be original to you, but the process that you've gone through to reach that viewpoint is individual

309
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,280
to you. There is a power in that. There's something important about that.

310
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:22,880
No, there's something crucial. If you're a practicing psychotherapist, one of the things

311
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:30,880
you have to learn is to not provide people with your words too much. What you want is for them

312
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,800
to formulate the conclusion. And you can guide them through the process of investigation. You

313
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:44,880
talked about the self-authoring process, which is online at selfauthoring.com, that it steps people

314
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,560
say through the process of writing an autobiography, of analyzing their current virtues and faults and

315
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:58,320
making a future plan. The utility of all of that is dependent on the person who's

316
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:08,240
undertaking the exercise, generating their own verbal representations. And that seems to cement

317
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:15,840
it somehow as yours if you've come up with the words. And so it's the uppermost expression of

318
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:23,200
personhood, the ability to have the words that you should speak reveal themselves to you and to

319
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:29,200
have the right to express them as you see fit. Yes. In which case, if you are merely repeating

320
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,640
an accepted script, then to what extent can you even say to be an individual at all?

321
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,760
I think that's part of the philosophical conundrum is that if you believe that all people do is repeat

322
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:50,960
predigested scripts, especially if your view is that the fundamental human motivation is power

323
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,920
and the entire social landscape is nothing but a competition between equally,

324
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:03,840
what would you say, selfish and single-minded power strivers, then there is no individual.

325
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,920
There's no individual in that conceptual world. And it seems to me that that's the world that

326
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:20,400
we're being pushed to inhabit and are criticized for on moral grounds for criticizing. And I'm

327
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:26,960
still trying to get my hands around this. I mean, when I went to Britain, I saw the CTTV cameras

328
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,040
and the increased security, and it isn't clear to me how that's related to the social justice issues

329
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:38,320
that so-called social justice issues that we're discussing. But they seem to me in some very

330
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,800
difficult to comprehend way, part and parcel of the same thing, the same dangerous thing.

331
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,360
Well, I think it's probably connected just in terms of this distrust of humanity or this

332
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:54,960
belief that people need to be shepherded, otherwise left to their own devices, chaos will reign.

333
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,640
I think that's the connection. It's not directly connected as far as the issues relating to liberty

334
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,360
and CTTV, obviously predate what we now call whatever the current social justice movement

335
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:12,560
is called. But I think there is something there. I mean, the censorship, the impulse

336
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:18,000
to censor what people read, and this is something that particularly hits home to me in the arts,

337
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:27,280
is based on this view that ultimately the people are or the populace is liable to corruption

338
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:32,320
if they're exposed to the wrong materials. And what's very interesting to me about that,

339
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,120
I mean, you've written a lot about the way in which literature, for instance, informs our

340
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,560
experiences because it is, in a sense, like when you read philosophers, you're feeling your way

341
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:47,200
through other lives and other experiences that are trans-historical and cross-cultural,

342
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,400
and they inform the way that you react in your own individual experience. But if you start to say,

343
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:58,720
as an artist, no, you can only represent for a start what you personally are or have experienced,

344
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,640
and you cannot represent anything which is morally problematic to use the phrase that they

345
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:09,200
absolutely adore, then art fails to, and literature in particular, fails to function in the way that

346
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,040
it should because you can't explore those things. This is why I often, when it comes to censorship

347
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:19,520
of the arts, I often go back to what Oscar Wilde said about this. He said, there's no such thing

348
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:25,600
as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written or badly written. That is all. And that

349
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:32,480
actually art and morality sometimes are not, in other words, art shouldn't just be about promoting

350
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,560
whatever the ethical trend is of any given time. It's much bigger than that.

351
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:42,560
Well, it's not art at that point at all. As far as I'm concerned, if you can state the purpose

352
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:50,960
of the art in explicit terms, especially if it's in accordance with, let's say, an ideology that's

353
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,520
shared by a multitude of people, it's not art at all. It's propaganda.

354
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,360
It's totally banal. I mean, this is why so many people are getting sick of Hollywood,

355
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,640
I mean, to bring it down to a different level, that people are sick of the entertainment on their

356
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,360
TV, on their streaming services, and on Hollywood, because they have this constant feeling that they're

357
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,880
being hectic by some moralistic person in a studio saying, you know, our focus here is on

358
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:19,120
diversity, our focus here is on the right moral message, that the message of the story is one

359
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,520
that would be approved by a group of intersectional activists, and you get this all the time seeping

360
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,520
into mainstream entertainment, and people get really, really sick of it. It's not that when

361
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:33,280
you see a lesbian kiss in Star Wars, that that offends you because you're a homophobe, most

362
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,520
sci-fi fans, they've never had a problem with diversity or anything like that. What bothers

363
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,800
them about it is this sense of someone saying to them, we think you're all evil bigots and you

364
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,360
need to be educated, and that's why we're going to shoehorn in a lesbian kiss into the end of this

365
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,520
film. That's why people have a problem. I mean, you had it yourself recently with that ludicrous

366
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:57,200
Marvel comics thing, where you became the Red Skull, and that to me was a perfect example of the

367
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:05,200
banality of an artistic endeavor that becomes an exercise in political pedagogy, because that

368
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:11,280
was quite clearly, I mean, you couldn't even say it was satirical, because it cannot be satirically

369
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,600
effective if the thing that they are comparing you to is the precise opposite of the thing you

370
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:21,520
believe. I mean, of all the sort of public figures I can think of, you have the most clear track

371
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,080
record of opposing tyranny in all its forms, which anyone who knows anything about your work will

372
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:31,440
know. You've spent years lecturing about the evils of authoritarianism, including Nazism. So the idea

373
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:40,640
that you would then become this super magic Nazi is propagandistic. It's totally banal artistically.

374
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,920
Firstly, you can't, it's not satirically, right? But also it's just, it's just, it's just,

375
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,000
do you know what it reminds me of? Actually, I don't know if you, if you remember after the Fatwa

376
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,000
against Salman Rushdie, there was a film made in Pakistan called International Gorillaz,

377
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,880
where they turned Salman Rushdie into this evil villain playboy who was colluding with the

378
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,560
Israeli military services. And at the end of the film, these flying copies of the Quran float down

379
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,560
and shoot laser beams into his head and kill him off. But it, and that is such a ridiculous,

380
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:17,280
laughable film, you know, you put your enemy as the main villain, and you just misrepresent him

381
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,720
in that way. Well, that's just what they did to you. It's as banal as that. And that's, I think

382
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:27,120
people are sick of that. Well, the response thankfully seems to indicate that, you know, it

383
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:32,800
didn't, did people, it didn't do me any harm as far as I can tell. I mean, it was very

384
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:39,440
shocking to me that it happened. It took me about 12 hours to sort of regain my composure,

385
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:45,120
because I actually couldn't believe it to begin with. I was sure that it was a fabrication,

386
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,760
especially, but then it was even more shocking when I found out who had authored it. You know,

387
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,760
it wasn't, it was someone who had an intellectual reputation. And so.

388
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,320
But he's an activist, isn't he? He's a, he's an intersectional activist.

389
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,520
He definitely, his opinions definitely place him on the radical,

390
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:11,360
on the side of the radical left. So it's very difficult to, so there's an attack on

391
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:20,240
the essence of free speech. I mean, I remember reading Derrida. Derrida criticized our culture,

392
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:26,240
Western culture as phallogocentric. Yeah. And it's really actually quite a precise word.

393
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:32,240
So the phallic part of it is masculine, obviously related to the phallus to the,

394
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:39,280
and logos is, well, that's the central concept of Greek rationalism,

395
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,840
but it's also the central concept of Christianity. And the logos is

396
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:51,840
something like the magical power of genuine and true speech. It's something like that. And

397
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:59,680
there are representations of the magical power of speech that predate Greece and Christianity.

398
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:06,960
You see it in Mesopotamia that this, the equivalent to the savior and ancient Mesopotamian

399
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:13,760
religious thinking was Marduk and he could speak magic words. He had eyes all the way around his

400
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,560
head, which meant that he paid attention to everything, but he could speak magic words. And

401
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:29,840
and so that idea of the centrality of speech to the, and its association with the very fabric of

402
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:36,640
reality, that's been an idea that has strived to make itself manifest for thousands and thousands

403
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:44,480
of years. I mean, in the Judeo-Christian tradition, in the biblical tradition, the word is given

404
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:51,760
cosmological status as the thing that brings habitable order out of chaos and it's identified

405
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:58,880
with divinity itself. And so the assault on free speech is an assault on a principle that's

406
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:05,120
fundamental beyond, say, its centrality, its central importance to the enlightenment.

407
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,800
And it's an assault on the, on the idea of the logos itself.

408
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:16,480
I agree. This is why I always mistrusted the, the post-structuralist. So when I was studying

409
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,880
for English, it was the Derrida and Foucault and Lyotard and these were taken as a given and this

410
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,960
idea that there's no, there is no truth beyond language, you know, language is all language,

411
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,400
the way in which we construct our perception of reality and our perception of truth. And

412
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,680
and that actually there is no truth at the heart of it. I just found it so depressing,

413
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,400
depressingly pessimistic because it also means that you construct, can construct any kind of

414
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,600
reality you like and it, and it also. Well, maybe that's part of the motivation for it is

415
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:50,720
the, the hypothetical lack of constraint by anything that that seems to imply, right? I mean,

416
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,760
if there's no canonical reality, while there's no responsibility, that's for sure. You could

417
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,760
argue that there's no meaning and it's deeply pessimistic, but maybe the payoff for that is no

418
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,000
responsibility, but there's also no constraint of any sort. There's certainly no ethical constraint

419
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:14,160
and I mean, I keep trying to dig to see what's at the bottom of this, this anti-logo sentiment and

420
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:21,520
it's a very, it's a very difficult thing to make to get right. Maybe it's not even as deliberate as

421
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:27,680
the way that it sounds. Maybe it is just the fact that that these theories for whatever reason became

422
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,760
fashionable in universities about 20 years ago and now for whatever reason they have

423
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,800
escaped into the mainstream and, and you know, I mean, most of the people that push this stuff

424
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:42,960
don't read Foucault and they don't know about the people whose ideas they've, they've imbibed and

425
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,880
actually very much misunderstood. You know, I mean, the whole point of the postmodernist was to,

426
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:52,560
to, to, to trash the notion of grand narratives and what we have now in the social justice movement

427
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,480
is an incredible grand narrative. You know, we are, we are on the right side of history. We are the

428
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,000
righteous ones and everyone else needs to be, you know, decimated and it's, it's, it seems to me

429
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,200
that this stuff, I don't think it's as conspiratorial as that. I think it's just sort of

430
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
circumstances of history, one thing after another and this is where we're at now,

431
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,400
but the end result that we have to deal with, which I think you've alluded to is this idea

432
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,440
that if there is no such thing as reality beyond language, then you are at liberty to, to construct

433
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:29,280
whatever a pseudo reality that you desire or is easiest for you. And we see elements of this

434
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,520
reverberating, I think in a lot of the discourse at the moment of things like lived experience,

435
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,400
you know, you can present as much data as you want, but it will be disregarded if it doesn't

436
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,120
tally with what lived experience really means, which is what I want to be true. Well, there's

437
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:49,280
also this insistence that seems part of it that, I mean, I objected to some legislation that was

438
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:55,280
passed in Canada and that's sort of what propelled me into public visibility, let's say.

439
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:03,200
And to begin with, I was mostly concentrating on the violation of the principle of free speech

440
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:09,520
that the legislation seemed to me to represent because it compelled certain utterances and

441
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:15,760
I was never a fan of hate speech laws to begin with. And, and this was something beyond hate

442
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,600
speech laws because hate speech laws stop you from saying things, whereas compelled speech laws

443
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:26,480
force you to say something which is much worse, even though the first one is also

444
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:33,760
inadvised, ill-advised as far as I'm concerned. But I've realized more recently that I was also

445
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:40,560
disturbed, although in a less explicit manner, with the theory of identity that was an implicit

446
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:47,360
part of the legislation. So with gender identity, for example, and we're engaged in a discussion

447
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:52,720
across our culture about gender identity, I mean, I know as a personality psychologist that

448
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,080
there are females, biological females who have masculine personalities and there are

449
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:05,680
biological males who have feminine personalities, that the link between personality as such and,

450
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:14,320
biological structure is suggestive, but not absolute. And there's a lot of variability.

451
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:23,120
But the idea that identity is something that you define yourself and that you can change

452
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:32,720
at will at any point seems to me to be entirely counterproductive and dangerous because it's

453
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:40,880
inaccurate. So your identity isn't merely your membership in whatever group you happen to identify

454
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,000
with at that moment. It's certainly not merely your sexuality or merely your race. In fact,

455
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:51,440
your identity is barely your race because your identity is something more like

456
00:43:52,640 --> 00:44:00,000
how you conduct yourself in the world. And if you define yourself as black, let's say,

457
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:08,000
that doesn't give you much of a map to encountering and approaching the world. It's nowhere near

458
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:17,680
detailed enough. And then the idea that you define it, I've been thinking about that a lot,

459
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:25,520
you never define your identity by yourself. You can't because you're surrounded by other people

460
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:31,600
and they have to play along with you. And if they don't play along with you voluntarily,

461
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:37,440
which means they appreciate the quality of your game and they understand it, then you're either

462
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:43,200
going to be alienated or you have to impose your identity by force. But that's also not a very good

463
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:49,040
solution. I mean, I just spent some time interviewing one of the world's foremost authorities on

464
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:54,640
aggression and that'll be released in a bit. Perhaps it's been released before this will be

465
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:02,960
released. He's done longitudinal studies of aggression. And if the idea that our social

466
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:10,240
structures are predicated on power was true, then children would start out not being aggressive and

467
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,400
they would become more aggressive with time. And the more aggressive children would be more

468
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:21,600
successful. And none of that is true. Children start out more aggressive than they are on average

469
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:27,200
by the time their adults. Aggression levels decrease with age rather than increasing. And

470
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:34,160
there's no evidence whatsoever that it's a useful long term strategy in the social world.

471
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:41,280
Identity is something you negotiate the way you negotiate a game. It has to be that way.

472
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,160
There's something rather sinister, isn't there, about the way in which present day identity

473
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:53,840
politics is about imposition onto others, rather than an assertion of who I am or whatever that

474
00:45:53,840 --> 00:46:00,000
might be. I mean, I always mistrusted it. And so I can see the utility of identity politics,

475
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,880
politically speaking, in scenarios where people are marginalized. You know, I understand why gay

476
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,920
people collectively came together back in the 60s to fight for their rights, because there was

477
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,840
obviously a serious problem or the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland in the 60s and 70s

478
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:18,160
and that kind of thing, where Catholics weren't able to have the vote or to get housing. So that

479
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:23,760
sort of makes sense to me. The current identity politics are what we might call identitarians.

480
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,680
A lot of it strikes me as about power. In fact, I feel like they would be an incredible subject

481
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:35,120
for Foucault if he were alive today, because I've noticed this correlation and a lot of people have

482
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:39,520
noticed this correlation. And I never get an answer about this. But why is it whenever online,

483
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,440
whenever I'm viciously attacked or threatened, something particularly pernicious,

484
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:51,280
the person doing it always has their pronouns in their bio or a rainbow gay flag in their bio.

485
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,600
Why is there a correlation that I've experienced again and again? I mean, it's almost inevitable

486
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:04,080
at this point, between the need to self identify in terms of sexuality and gender, and a kind of

487
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,000
cruelty or viciousness or a need to attack an aggression.

488
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:15,600
Well, one of the things that disturbs me constantly about ideological representations of

489
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:23,200
the world, broadly speaking, is that their fundamental danger is that they always contain

490
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:31,200
a too convenient theory of evil and malevolence. And for me, any theory that locates the fundamental

491
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:38,480
problem of evil somewhere other than inside you is dangerous. Now, that isn't to say that

492
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:45,760
social structures can't be corrupted and aren't corrupt. That's an existential problem in and

493
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,720
of itself. It's always the case that our social institutions aren't what they should be and

494
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:55,920
they're outdated and they're predicated to some degree on deceit. And people who use power can

495
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:02,000
manipulate them sometimes successfully. That problem never goes away and it never will. But

496
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:12,320
when the evil can be easily located somewhere else, then you have every moral right to allow your

497
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:19,040
unexamined motivations to manifest themselves fully because you can punish the evildoers and

498
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,440
always remain on the moral side of the fence. There's a huge attractiveness in that.

499
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,000
I think, I mean, this is something you've explored a lot with the idea of the Solzhenitsyn's

500
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,080
idea about the good and evil cutting through the heart of every human being. Because that, to me,

501
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,840
it really gets to the heart of a lot of what I would call a kind of infantile culture. I think

502
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:47,760
this is a symptom of childishness. Whenever I was learning about literature and what

503
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,320
constituted more sophisticated literature and what didn't, Disney films, childish films,

504
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:56,960
let's take Tolkien, for instance, good people look, sorry, bad people look bad, they look like

505
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,800
orcs, they're ugly, and they are villains, and then there are heroes and they are good,

506
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,760
there isn't complexity. And if you have a more complex novel, like a Mervyn Peake novel where

507
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,280
people aren't necessarily good or bad, they're both, they struggle within themselves and with

508
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,480
other people, that is a mark of a kind of adult novel as opposed to a childish novel, right? And

509
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,640
that's quite an important distinction. And I think most of the political and ideological battles

510
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,640
that I find myself in the middle of, and I'm sure you do as well, are because people are just

511
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:28,080
reducing everything to this binary of good versus evil and putting themselves on the side of good.

512
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:37,600
It is a very infantile, almost like a caricature of religion. And I see it again and again,

513
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,600
we had it in this country with the Brexit vote, effectively, what happened in the vote here.

514
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:46,080
And the reason why it became so toxic and families fell apart, and you wouldn't believe,

515
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:50,080
I know it wasn't reported very much elsewhere, but it was like a kind of ideological civil war

516
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:54,400
here, but not a very sophisticated one, because it came down to this narrative that if you voted

517
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,840
to leave the EU, you were evil, racist, stupid. And if you voted to remain, you were good and

518
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:04,400
progressive, and all the rest and noble and virtuous, right? And of course, there are all

519
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:10,000
sorts of good reasons to have voted either way. And this kind of caricature, and it happens again

520
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:16,960
with... Well, you described it as a caricature of religion. And I think that's what an ideology is.

521
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:25,600
And this is one of the reasons that I've been inclined, let's say, to go to have my shot at the

522
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:31,600
rational atheists, much as I'm a fan of enlightenment thinking. I mean, I was convinced,

523
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:38,000
as a consequence of reading Jung primarily, but also Dostoevsky and also Nietzsche primarily,

524
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:45,520
and Solzhenitsyn, I would say, as well, that... And then biology as well, as I studied that more

525
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:57,200
deeply. There's no escaping a religious framework. There's no way out of it. And if you eliminate it,

526
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:04,160
say, as a consequence of rational criticism, what you inevitably produce is its replacement by

527
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,840
forms of religion that are much less sophisticated. I mean...

528
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:14,720
Well, it's not religion. It's a fundamentalist religion. You know, if I look back to my Catholic

529
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:20,160
upbringing, actually acknowledging your own capacity for sin is at the heart of Catholicism.

530
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,080
That's why we have the confessional. That's why you sit there and tell this stranger all these

531
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:31,760
things you've done wrong. Because it's reckoning with it. Well, that's far from trivial. It's

532
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:37,680
unbelievably not trivial. And because it was so common, like a common part of Catholicism,

533
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:45,360
it can be passed over without notice. And so the religious structures that we inherited,

534
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:49,840
I'm going to talk about Christianity most specifically, because it's the dominant form of...

535
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:56,000
It's the form of religious belief that primarily undergirds our social structures.

536
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,960
It's our operating system. My producer came up with that term the other day, and I thought it was

537
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:10,000
apt. And it does localize the drama between good and evil inside and makes you responsible for that

538
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:18,400
and encourages you, let's say, to attend to the ways that you fall short of the ideal. And

539
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:24,320
when you criticize a structure like that out of existence, you don't criticize the questions that

540
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:31,280
gave rise to it out of existence. And the questions might be, well, what's the nature of the good?

541
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,440
What's the nature of evil? Those are religious questions. What's the purpose of our life?

542
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:41,920
How do you orient yourself if you're trying to move up, let's say, rather than down?

543
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,440
How should you conduct yourself, et cetera, et cetera? Those questions don't go away.

544
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:55,440
They can't not be answered. And so the way that a traditional religious structure answers them is,

545
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:01,920
in a mysterious way, it uses ritual, it uses music, it uses art, it uses literature, it uses

546
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:07,200
stories, all these things that are outside the realm of easy criticism. And then some of that's

547
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:13,680
translated into comprehensible, explicit dogma, and that's the part that's most susceptible to

548
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:19,600
rational criticism. But when that disappears, I've been thinking about this a lot this week,

549
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:25,280
because of what happened to Richard Dawkins recently. And I have my differences with Dawkins

550
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:30,480
and the rest of the rational atheists, because I think that they underestimated the danger of

551
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:37,200
dispensing with what they were attempting to dispense with. And I see the influx of religious

552
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:44,240
fervor associated with political ideas as a direct consequence of the lack of separation,

553
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,760
let's say, between church and state, psychologically.

554
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:54,240
But Dawkins has fallen foul of this new religion, but his case actually really is

555
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,880
testimony to what we're talking about, that this is not a religion in a traditional sense,

556
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,880
it is an infantile religion that only sees things in binaries of good and evil, because

557
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:08,960
he was effectively, he was posing a question about identity. He was saying, if it is possible for

558
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:15,600
Rachel Dollazal to identify as black, why is she universally condemned and derided,

559
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:20,400
but somebody can identify as the opposite sex, and they are celebrated. And all he was doing

560
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,880
was posing the question, he wasn't even actually making a claim.

561
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,960
Yeah, well, he was doing, he was doing what a scientist actually does. I mean, I've been shocked

562
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:35,360
frequently in my interactions with journalists, because I've worked as a scientist for three

563
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:40,320
decades, and I'm accustomed to the way that scientists think and speak. And when I'm sitting

564
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:45,840
around with my graduate students, and there's a problem or an issue, what they do, and my colleagues

565
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:50,880
as well, is generate a bunch of hypotheses about why that might be. They don't necessarily believe

566
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:58,000
them, but the first trick is to generate as many, what would you say, hypotheses, I said that already,

567
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:02,240
that might account for it, ranging from biological through social, etc.

568
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:06,400
And that is exactly what Dawkins did. He even said that's what he was doing.

569
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:11,200
That puts you on the side of the devil. I mean, there was a viral tweet this week from a teacher

570
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,440
saying, I will never allow my pupils to play devil's advocate. I will never allow that in the

571
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,600
class, because some views are oppressive and are not to be entertained. I mean,

572
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:24,000
but that's the point. That's why the Vatican will call in a devil's advocate when someone is

573
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,560
potentially being canonized. Well, if you can't play devil's advocate, you can't think.

574
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:35,440
You have to have a devil's advocate in your head. If you don't have a devil's advocate in your head

575
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:40,080
torturing every thought you generate, you're not engaged in critical thinking.

576
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:44,880
Right. That's the scientific process to disprove yourself. I mean, that's what surprises me about

577
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:51,120
Richard Dawkins' response, because I think what he didn't realize is that he was caught in this

578
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:57,680
good versus evil binary, and he was the heretic now. He had been branded. He posed the question,

579
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:05,040
you're not meant to pose. And therefore, he's now outed himself as one of the demons. He's

580
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:10,480
there in pandemonium with the other demons. Now, so then he, of course, backtracked and

581
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:16,080
apologized and said, well, I didn't want to offend anyone. And of course, in an adult

582
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:21,840
rational world, that would be taken in good faith. And I don't think he fully appreciates

583
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:26,320
what's going on here, is that he's already marked himself as the sinner.

584
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:31,600
Well, here's his apology, let's say. Now, what he should have said, as far as I'm concerned,

585
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:41,520
here's what he said. I do not intend to disparage trans people. I see that my academic

586
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:48,080
disgust question has been misconstrued as such, and I deplore this. It was also not my attempt to

587
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:55,440
ally in any way with Republican bigots in the US now exploiting this issue. And so it's so interesting

588
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:01,280
that that's what he did, because- Well, it's buying into the tribalism thing. You know-

589
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:09,840
Well, it's also, it's not the best response to defend him. What he should have said was something

590
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:17,840
like, look, people, here's something to think about that I was posing. That's what scientists do.

591
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,840
And you didn't understand that, but that's not my problem. It's your lack of sophistication. But

592
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:32,400
instead of saying that, he immediately removed himself from the bad people, and that was the

593
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:40,240
Republican bigots, which just seems to me to pour fuel on the fire. And then he also said

594
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:45,840
that he didn't intend to disparage trans people, which isn't the issue at all.

595
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:50,000
Well, also, there was no implication in what he asked that he had ever intended to disparage

596
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,920
trans people. But to be fair to him, to be fair to him, I understand when you're caught in the

597
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:58,080
middle of a Twitter storm, you just want it to stop. And I've heard you talk about this as well,

598
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:02,640
is actually your response probably isn't going to be the best one. You just wanted to go away.

599
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,640
No, well, look, I mean, one of the things that's really worth pointing out here, and it's not

600
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:11,120
like I don't have sympathy for Dawkins. I have sympathy for Dawkins. I sent out a tweet defending

601
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:16,320
him yesterday. I mean, Dawkins is an admirable scientist. In my estimation, I learned lots from

602
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:23,840
reading his books. That doesn't mean I don't have my criticisms of Dawkins. But just because you have

603
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:28,560
criticisms of someone doesn't mean that they've never done anything worthwhile or that you haven't

604
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:32,400
learned something from them. And that's especially true in the scientific realm.

605
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:46,000
I just don't understand why. Okay, so back to the Twitter issue. So what I've seen repeatedly,

606
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,760
and this is worth some discussion, is when I'm watching Twitter, when I'm watching these attacks

607
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:58,080
on people, what I've seen the most general pattern of response to be is that it doesn't take very

608
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:03,600
many people attacking you on Twitter before it's seriously psychologically disturbing.

609
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,200
And that is interestingly related to this whole issue of hate speech that we've been discussing,

610
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:14,800
because it is the case that vicious attacks have quite a pronounced psychological effect,

611
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:20,880
especially if they're personal. And people generally fold and apologize instantly if my

612
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:26,400
sense is being if the Twitter mob is 20 people. It's sort of like they're reacting to 20 of their

613
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:33,280
neighbors showing up on their doorsteps with pitchforks and torches. And I think it's actually

614
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:40,400
an admirable response in some sense, because a well-socialized person actually does care what

615
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:46,880
their neighbors think. And if you offend 20 of your neighbors, it's possible 20 of your tribe,

616
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,960
it's possible that you've done something wrong. You might ask yourself that. Now, on Twitter,

617
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:55,600
you're connected to hundreds of thousands of people. And if you would offend 20,

618
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,080
it's not clear what that means. It might just mean that you said something.

619
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:04,320
It feels a lot worse than it actually is as well. It feels amplified, because there's all these people

620
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:08,320
who are strangers who know absolutely nothing about you. And it's particularly frustrating,

621
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:13,200
because more often than not, when it's happened to me, it's always been an imagined grievance.

622
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:17,040
It's not actually something I've said, it's something that they've assumed that I've said,

623
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:21,520
or a way that they have interpreted this. And the more you try and fight back against it,

624
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:26,880
or try and explain your actual position, the more they double down on their, and you've had this

625
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,320
as well, people are going after a figment of their own imagination, that's impossible to fend off.

626
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,520
And it does do psychological harm. And I've never denied that. And this is something I

627
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:39,600
addressed in the book, because I quoted, I can't remember her name now, but a writer talking about

628
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:46,000
how hate speech could be said to be violence, insofar as the psychological impact can have,

629
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,400
it can have a physiological impact, it can make you sick, it can make you unwell, the impact of

630
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:56,800
words. But of course, the example I use is taxation, I could fall physically sick, because I'm

631
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:00,000
under stress from being overly taxed by the government. Does that mean that the government

632
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,000
has committed an act of violence against me? It could be applied to absolutely anything, I think.

633
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,800
Well, an anarchist would argue yes.

634
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:11,840
Right, sure, exactly. But that wouldn't be me. But you could apply that to absolutely any

635
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:16,880
conceivable scenario, where anything that has happened to you has led to stress and physical

636
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,880
degeneration. And so I don't think it's right to single speech out and say,

637
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,680
speech is, but we can say that that's fine. Well, also, it's a one-sided argument, because

638
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:31,440
dangerous as speech, free speech is, we don't ever have to deny that there's such a thing as

639
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:37,600
hateful speech or damaging speech or corrosive speech or untruth speech or pathological speech

640
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:44,560
in every possible direction. That isn't the issue. The issue is, what's more dangerous to

641
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:50,400
regulate it or to leave it be, despite its dangers? That's the only rational argument,

642
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:55,600
or the only complete argument, let's say. Even if you have the most repugnant character who is

643
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:00,880
advocating the most vile ideas about society and attempting to proselytise even someone who's

644
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:06,480
attempting to recruit people to his or her cause, even something as vicious as neo-Naziism or something

645
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,120
like that, the question isn't, do I support what that person is saying? Because obviously,

646
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:18,080
we don't. The question is, do you take a few instances of people behaving in this way and use

647
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:23,280
that as a reason, a justification to empower the state to make a decision about what people

648
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:28,400
can say and think? That's the bigger principle that's at stake here. I worry that with social

649
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,800
media and Twitter as well, is that we end up buying into the illusion that there are more

650
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:37,280
hateful people in the world than there actually are, because even the people who send these hateful

651
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:41,680
things probably wouldn't behave like that in real life. There's something about the online world,

652
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:46,640
and what it does is absolutely, I mean, this is the heart of cancel culture. This is why it works.

653
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:50,800
Like you said, it's just a few tweets. That's all it takes. I've seen situations where companies

654
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:56,480
and corporations will backtrack on a policy just because of one or two tweets, because they fear

655
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:04,480
this deluge of people. It has such disproportionate power, and often with this kind of

656
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,280
cancel culture, it is often about something that someone hasn't even said. The example of Dawkins

657
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:14,000
is perfect, because a lot of the people and some prominent people I saw were saying, look,

658
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:19,600
Dawkins is now outed himself as a transphobe. If you said to them, where is the transphobic thing?

659
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:24,560
You him today, you tomorrow, buckle. Well, quite, because if someone is transphobic,

660
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:30,480
simply because you've decided that. It was the same with JK Rowling. It became suddenly

661
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:36,400
quite normal for commentators on the mainstream media to say that she has said transphobic things.

662
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:42,080
Well, where? Because I've read her comments and her essay on the trans issue that she posted on

663
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:47,840
her blog, and it was a long essay, which was very compassionate and nuanced, and at no point,

664
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:51,680
it's the opposite. She says that she supports trans rights, and she would stand there against

665
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:55,680
any discrimination. And I've been in these fights all the time. If ever you ask someone to say,

666
01:03:55,680 --> 01:04:01,680
can you just quote the transphobic thing that she said, they never can? And an adult would say,

667
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:05,600
okay, I can't find the evidence of my preconception, so therefore I should revise

668
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:11,120
my view. But they don't. They double down on it, and they find these sort of, they use

669
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:18,080
casuistry and whatever linguistic semantic tricks they can to come background to the

670
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:22,320
conclusion they'd already decided. Same with Dawkins. I mean, not just the American Humanist

671
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:26,640
Association. I saw a major blogger saying that anyone who was defending him is transphobic.

672
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:31,440
And like, well, if that's all it takes to be smeared in this way, if it doesn't matter what you

673
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:36,240
say, if all that matters is what people decide that you believe, then I suppose this goes back

674
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:40,480
to this pseudo reality we were discussing. Well, I guess what Dawkins got in trouble for,

675
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:46,400
let's take it apart a bit, okay? Because it's worth doing. He said, this is his original tweet,

676
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:55,840
in 2015, Rachel Dolezal, a white chapter president of NAACP, was vilified for identifying as black.

677
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:04,160
Some men choose to identify as women, and some women choose to identify as men. You will be

678
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:10,880
vilified if you deny that they literally are what they identify as. Discuss. Okay, so we put

679
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:20,480
forth a set of propositions, but the proposition has a point. And the point is, what is it that you

680
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:30,960
can and can't identify with? And what power do people have to enforce their decision on others?

681
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:36,880
And that's really the question he's asking if you strip it down. And that is actually a question

682
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:41,600
that's very threatening to, well, let's see, who would it be threatening to? Well, it would be

683
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:48,640
threatening to anyone who insists that you can choose an identity, say, in the realm of gender,

684
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:54,400
and that you should have the right to enforce your choice, despite other people's opinions,

685
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:59,280
let's say. So he's asking, why is there an inherent contradiction in the intersectional

686
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:07,200
discourse? Why is it that racial identity is not malleable, and in fact has to be strictly

687
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:12,960
policed? Hence why we have all these debates about cultural appropriation. Why is that so rigid?

688
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,040
And yet, even if the lived experience, let's go back to that, the lived experience of the person

689
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:22,240
tells them otherwise. I mean, Rachel Dollazelle wrote a whole book in which she outlines how she

690
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:27,120
feels that she has always been black. It isn't just, I choose to be black one day, it is something

691
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:33,120
her lived experience is that, in essence, she is. So why is that to be vilified universally

692
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:38,080
without question and there's no discussion to be had here? And yet, someone who chooses,

693
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:45,120
you know, that gender identity is something that is malleable and open to options and actually

694
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:49,520
infinite options. Why? And I think there is a contradiction. Well, maybe he's vilified because

695
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:54,560
he asked a question that's at the heart of the problem with identity politics, period. I mean,

696
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:58,160
particularly because when it comes to race, I mean, virtually all intersectionists would accept

697
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:01,920
that race is socially constructed. This is something they're always talking about. And so

698
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:07,520
therefore, in a sense, there is more of a case for transracialism. If you want to say that it is

699
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:12,480
an identity that can be mixed. Well, in some sense, we already accept transracialism as a given. And

700
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:23,120
so here's something I might as well get in trouble for this. Well, if your ancestry is 95% Caucasian

701
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:33,440
and 5% non Caucasian Asian black, let's say, you're not Caucasian. Generally speaking, you can

702
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,680
identify with the minority group. And so at some point, the question becomes, well,

703
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:44,240
it's a ridiculous question, which is why the whole notion of group identity construed in this way

704
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:52,240
is so pathological. But we obviously accept some degree of transracial identification if

705
01:07:53,840 --> 01:08:00,400
your racial group is disproportionately in one category, but you identify with the other,

706
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:04,160
and that's instantly not only accepted, it's standard practice.

707
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:08,720
Right. And I'm with the intersectionists on this. And so far as race, we're all the same. You know,

708
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:12,880
at ever since we've broken down the human genome, we know there are no differences between us. So

709
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:20,320
this idea that it must be so rigidly policed, this social construct, these arbitrary ideas,

710
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:25,120
and yet gender, I mean, I think it's something. Okay, so now we know why now we know exactly why

711
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:29,680
Dawkins got himself in so much trouble. Well, okay, you know, put his finger. Well, it will,

712
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:35,360
for sure, for sure. But magical super Nazis are always in trouble. So you know, exactly. But

713
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:42,240
then with the question of the gender identity debate, but this is the debate we need to be

714
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:47,120
having is actually the other thing he put his finger on there is that actually people are arguing

715
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:53,200
with different definitions in their heads, you know, for the identitarians, the idea of a woman,

716
01:08:54,080 --> 01:09:00,480
a woman is an identity, it isn't a biological reality. But for most people, the classification

717
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:06,320
of woman is biological reality, not identity. So in other words, and why is it that we cannot

718
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:10,240
have that discussion? So okay, so you believe this thing, we believe the other. And that's why

719
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:14,800
we're at loggerheads. But let's let's have the discussion. Why can that not happen? Why does it

720
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:19,360
have to be if you've decided? Well, that's what we're that's actually what we're trying to unpack

721
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:23,920
is what's the motivation at the root of this. And it seems to me, I do believe it's something like

722
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:29,520
a pronounced infantilism. I mean, one of the things I've been toying with is the idea that

723
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:41,360
the the gender that the demand for gender fluidity in late adolescence, let's say,

724
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:48,080
is something like the consequence of insufficient fantasy play in childhood.

725
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:57,760
That that I remember, for example, when my son was little, his sister and her friends

726
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:03,200
used to dress him up as a fairy princess. They did this with some regularity. And I kind of cast

727
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:07,680
a dim eye on that. But I thought it through. And, you know, it sort of disturbed me. And then I

728
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:12,800
thought it through. And I thought, wait a second here, leave the kid alone, leave the girls alone.

729
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:19,120
He is playing out what it means to be female in dramatic play. And he needs to do that because

730
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:24,240
otherwise he can't understand what it means to be female. That's how children understand,

731
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:29,600
that's how adults understand things. For God's sake, we go to a movie and we watch someone play

732
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:34,880
out of female and we identify with that because otherwise we wouldn't be enjoying the movie and

733
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:40,480
we get we get a bit of a clue about what it's like to inhabit someone else's skin. So there's

734
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:48,080
this necessity for play in gender roles and that has to manifest itself. And if the play has been

735
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:55,280
interrupted, let's say by electronic equipment, for example, or any of the other things that

736
01:10:55,280 --> 01:11:00,640
might be interrupting it, well, maybe that desire comes back with a vengeance later. And I have to

737
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:06,160
be whoever I say I am. I have to be able to play with this. And well, if it's a developmental

738
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:11,600
requirement, there's going to be a lot of insistence behind it. And it looks immature and it is because

739
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,680
it should have happened earlier. Most people stabilize their gender identity by the time

740
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:23,120
they're three or four. But it doesn't always happen. So there is an infantilism in this demand

741
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:29,360
for fluidity of identity, this insistence that other people play the game that I insist they're

742
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:34,000
going to play. And then what about the idea that the gender critical feminists would come in and say,

743
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:39,920
well, the idea of a boy dressing up in a dress, there's nothing inherently female about that or

744
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:44,880
feminine about that in any case that all of this is a construct anyway. And why can't we let the

745
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,960
kids just some kids are not gender conforming and they can just do what they want. I mean,

746
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:56,640
the concern I have with the current identity obsessed ideology is that they see a boy in a dress

747
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:04,000
and they will say, well, he could potentially be a woman. And by doing so are reinforcing the most

748
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:12,800
conservative views of gender to begin with. And that to me, I'm intuitively against that because

749
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:18,160
I wasn't a gender conforming. I didn't play football with the other boys. I didn't dress up in

750
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:26,080
dresses, but I may have done if they were lying around. I find it very odd that this supposedly

751
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:33,760
progressive radical movement is so dependent on the idea of very, very traditional unyielding

752
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,040
notions of what it is to be male and what it is to be female.

753
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:47,440
Yeah, but only in the case where the identity is across the sex. So you can be, if you're a man

754
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:53,120
who believes he's a woman, that's inviolable and has a biological reference point. But if you're

755
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:58,720
a woman who thinks she's a woman, it doesn't. It's completely malleable. And so that's an

756
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:04,080
inherent contradiction again. And it's worthy of discussion, surely. And the contradiction

757
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:08,640
doesn't just go away because you won't allow the conversation to happen, which is a contradiction

758
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:14,880
gets played out in in actuality if you don't allow it to be dealt with in abstraction.

759
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:20,160
So then the question is, how do we break through? And I mean, this is something I've been

760
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:26,240
really, really thinking about is that it isn't no, it's no longer just a matter of trying to

761
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:32,000
persuade people. It's almost trying to de-radicalize people at this point. How do I explain to

762
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,680
someone the world isn't this fantasy world that you've created in your head, where it's just

763
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:40,240
it's full of transphones and neo-Nazis and all these and good versus evil. The world is actually

764
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:44,720
much more complex and nuanced and requires discussion and thought. How do you break through

765
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:48,800
someone's fantasy so that we can have that discussion? Well, it used to be that you sent

766
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:53,360
them to the university so they could study humanities. That's the last thing you should do

767
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:58,240
now. Well, that was the answer. I mean, that was the whole point, right, to to make people more

768
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:04,640
sophisticated in their conceptions. And in which cases, is it the case that it's over now? If people

769
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:11,120
were to be educated out of those problems and now that actually the higher education itself has

770
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:15,200
become so ideologically driven that to go to university means you end up more indoctrinated

771
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:19,520
than when you went there. What hope is there? I feel like I'm, I sound a bit frustrated here,

772
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:23,920
but I feel like I'm bashing my head against a brick wall because half, most of the time when

773
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,800
I'm caught in an argument with these ideologues, they are arguing, like I say, with a monster

774
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,920
they've created in their own heads. I'm not the person they think I am. I don't have the values

775
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:36,640
they think I have. And therefore, the discussion is stymied from the outset. And it does make me

776
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:41,600
very frustrated. And that's probably the real reason I wrote the book, actually, because I want

777
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:45,520
I want the idea of free speech to be elevated again as a sacrosanct principle,

778
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:49,120
so that we can have these conversations and so that people don't get demonized and

779
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:54,480
attacked for things they don't believe. And so that we can reach some kind of consensus

780
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:58,320
on these issues that we've been describing, these contentious issues, because when you have an issue

781
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:02,240
that's particularly tendentious, you, it requires more conversation, it requires more discussion

782
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:05,440
and more understanding. And I don't think we're getting that at the moment.

783
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,800
Yeah, well, I guess I'm somewhat optimistic about that, because I can see all the possibility that

784
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:16,400
long form conversations of this sort bring.

785
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:20,960
Well, there's an appetite for them, isn't there? But is there an appetite for them

786
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:25,920
from the activists and the ideologues who have seen so much control in our major educational

787
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:26,920
cultural institutions?

788
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:33,600
Yeah, I think so. I think so. I think so. I mean, I've been struck by how deep the hunger

789
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:39,200
how deep the hunger is for for genuine conversation and very much heartened by it.

790
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,720
And so that's a counter movement.

791
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:48,240
I hope you're right. I just don't see any evidence of that from the people I'm talking about. I

792
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:51,600
don't see it from the people who will say to educate yourself.

793
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:56,000
It's another problem too, though, isn't it with Twitter, for example, is that it's never the same

794
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:02,880
people. And that plays with us psychologically, because of course, we are built to more or less

795
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:09,920
assume that we're interacting with a continuous community. And we aren't. We're interacting

796
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:16,160
with a discontinuous community on Twitter. And so we're led astray in our presuppositions constantly.

797
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:22,160
But it's worse than that. Because it isn't... I know it's different people all the time,

798
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:25,760
but they all have the same views on absolutely everything. It feels like you're arguing with

799
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:30,000
the Borg. It feels like just one mind speaking through many, many voices.

800
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,920
Yes, well, it is. Then that's the hallmark of an ideology. It is precisely that.

801
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:39,600
Then I guess it's a matter of it's certainly and it's a matter of trying to understand the

802
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:43,200
ideology ever more deeply to see what it's actually focused on.

803
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:47,600
But I do read their books and I do read their articles and I do try to understand.

804
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:51,760
I don't believe the people I'm talking about return the favor. They always use the phrase

805
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:58,080
educate yourself. And what they mean by that is read these select books and digest them uncritically.

806
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:03,280
That's what they mean by educate yourself. They don't mean read widely and tackle the

807
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:07,360
various views and come to a conclusion yourself. The last thing they want is critical thought.

808
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:11,600
Critical thought is the enemy. Ironically, it's the enemy of critical theory.

809
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:15,360
No, it's a hallmark of white supremacy culture as far as I can see, right?

810
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,360
That's what they say. But that's what they claim.

811
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:22,800
It's amazing too to see that set of ideas propagate itself across the culture so quickly.

812
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:28,480
The Canadian federal government in its diversity, inclusivity and equity training program

813
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:35,040
now uses those concepts like associating white supremacy with punctuality, for example.

814
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:40,880
They use those in the training of their civil servants. It's been accepted wholeheartedly to

815
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:45,120
that degree. I've seen them. I've seen the screenshots that often get leaked of these

816
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:50,240
training sessions and it bullet pointed hallmarks of white supremacy, punctuality,

817
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:52,560
politeness, hard work. Perfectionism.

818
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:57,360
Yeah. All these noble things. I'm thinking, well, if I was a person of color, I would be

819
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:02,560
outraged by this, this idea that this is a culture that's alien to me. It's so offensive.

820
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:10,000
But so absurd. You can hardly mount an argument against it. I mean,

821
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:16,880
conscientiousness is a personality trait and there's no racial differences in conscientiousness.

822
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:23,360
Right. And it wouldn't matter to me. If it was just a few idiots on Twitter or these extreme,

823
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:28,640
it wouldn't matter to me, but these people have disproportionate power, institutional power,

824
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:34,240
political power. I mean, the Biden administration is on side with an awful lot of this kind of stuff

825
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:41,920
and the end point. So is the Trudeau government. I mean, to have this in the training documentation

826
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:45,920
that's produced by the federal government is just absolutely stunning. It's also the document

827
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:50,320
that I was referring to. I tweeted about it yesterday. It's so badly written that it's

828
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:58,320
stunning. It's maddening with him. And how is it he's got away with his history of blackface,

829
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:03,120
for instance? How is it that there is no consistency there? Like, you know, it's

830
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:07,040
lack of effective opposition is a big part of it. It's insane. I mean, if you look at those old

831
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:10,560
videos, it looks like he spent more time in blackface than out of it. And yet he isn't the one

832
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:14,480
who's being attacked and vilified for that. It's okay. He's got a free pass. It's weird to me.

833
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:19,360
Yeah, well, the opposition in Canada, and this is a problem in general, is a real problem for

834
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:25,120
our entire culture, is that the woke narrative is very romantically attractive. It's got this

835
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:30,480
rebelliousness about it and this impetus to go out and march in the streets and, you know, to

836
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:36,080
work on a global cause. And like traditional conservatives and even traditional liberals

837
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:42,880
can't mount a counter narrative. They don't have the imagination. And it's a huge problem.

838
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,720
The trouble is, though, the cause that they're fighting for is largely illusory,

839
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:52,000
and that to me is very frightening. We've had people in this country claim that our major

840
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,080
universities, such as Oxford and Cambridge, are structurally institutionally racist. All of the

841
01:19:56,080 --> 01:20:01,120
data tells us this is just simply not the case. Oh, yes. Well, that's just happening constantly

842
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:06,480
in Canadian universities. The McGill physics department has now put out a diversity inclusivity

843
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:11,760
and equity statement that's predicated on exactly those views.

844
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:18,080
Well, I think we need to push back against this particular hyper-racialization of society,

845
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:23,360
because it is reinscribing old racial tropes, even to the extent of fear of miscegenation,

846
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:27,600
this old racist idea of this fear of mixed couples. You know, there was an article in

847
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:32,640
The Guardian here recently talking about how finding mixed race people attractive is problematic.

848
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:38,800
It's almost just taking old racist ideas and just giving them a kind of hint of respectability.

849
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:44,160
Of course, the end point of that is segregation. You saw presumably the story in California,

850
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:49,360
the Brentwood School, the elite school that segregated its parents, but on their, what was

851
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:53,040
it, a dialogue session with the teachers, and you would have white parents in one room and

852
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:56,000
black parents in the other room. You're seeing that in convocation ceremonies at universities, too.

853
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:03,360
How can this be anything other than racist? It's interesting that the group, Fair, the

854
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:07,600
group Foundation Against Intolerance and Racism, a lot of those people who are doing great work,

855
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:14,080
I think, are starting to call this neo-racism. There needs to be a label for it. I think maybe

856
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:18,560
that's the right way to go about it, because the word racism has almost become meaningless,

857
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:24,320
because the people who use it the most, they throw it around so liberally. I never believe it when I

858
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:29,040
hear someone branded that way. I assume it's someone not being honest and not being truthful.

859
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:33,200
So what do we call this? What do you call it when people are advancing the cause of racial

860
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:38,640
segregation in the name of anti-racism? What do you call that? I think that's going to be the

861
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:42,960
real struggle. It's not just breaking through the fantasy world. I don't like this idea of

862
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:47,280
having to negotiate someone else's dreamland. There's that thing, firstly, but also there's

863
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:51,360
the linguistic mind fields. How do you convince people? The other reason, I mean, you mentioned

864
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:56,080
the rebellious aspect of it, I think the other reason why it's so appealing is because the language

865
01:21:56,080 --> 01:22:02,800
sounds like you're doing good. Social justice, anti-racism. Who wouldn't be anti-racist? Black

866
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:09,120
lives matter. Of course they do. Who would disagree with that? But these phrasing can be used to push

867
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:14,800
through some very pernicious ideas. I mean, when it comes to anti-racism, for instance, I mean,

868
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:19,840
Ibrahim X. Kendi makes it absolutely clear in his book that he feels to be not racist is simply

869
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:26,800
another form of racism, that this dichotomy doesn't exist. Well, and that's why I find it very hard

870
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:31,040
when I'm having these arguments, because if I say I have a real problem with anti-racism,

871
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:35,760
people will say, oh, I see. So you're for racism. And then you have to explain what anti-racism means

872
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:39,600
when used by these academics in these very niche fields such as whiteness studies. You have to

873
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:45,920
explain first what that means, why that's dangerous for society, and how in order to genuinely oppose

874
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:50,080
racism, you have to oppose the discourse of anti-racism. I mean, when you say it like that,

875
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:57,120
it's maddening, isn't it? It's like, it's the stuff of nightmares, because there is no coherent

876
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:03,200
sense. And because so much of it is rooted in language and misdirection through language and

877
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:09,360
shielding what is actually meant, it becomes impossible to win the argument. And maybe that's

878
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:16,240
the point. Maybe this, they gave the word to us, gaslighting. When they gaslight all the time and

879
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:21,680
say the culture war is a right-wing myth, or cancel the people who are the chief practitioners of

880
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:26,000
cancer culture saying that cancer culture doesn't exist, when they say the opposite of what is the

881
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:33,760
observable reality. I don't know how to break through that, how to break through those arguments,

882
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:37,440
because not only have they constructed a pseudo-reality in their own minds,

883
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:41,200
they've constructed the language with which to sustain that pseudo-reality,

884
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:45,520
so no one else can be drawn out of it. And that to me is going to be the challenge.

885
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:52,800
Let me ask you, let's go sideways for a minute now. And I suppose this is an exploration of

886
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:58,080
potential solutions as well. This has been a very serious conversation, but you're a satirist and

887
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:03,360
a comedian as well. And so you have to... Isn't it terrible how unfunny I am in real life? Isn't

888
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:08,240
that awful? When I'm doing stand-up, if I've got a script, I can be funny, but I can't be funny

889
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:14,400
spontaneously. People are very disappointed about that. I'm sorry. Well, I'm curious about your

890
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:20,560
motivations. Let's talk about Titania McGrath. Why don't you define, describe her first for everyone?

891
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:28,640
So Titania McGrath originated as a Twitter character in around April 2018. And the idea of

892
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:35,840
the character is that she is a very privileged, po-faced, young, white, intersectional activist

893
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:40,320
who is determined to be offended by absolutely anything. She can problematize absolutely anything.

894
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:46,720
You know, you could give her a pair of shoes or a hat or a holiday in Margate, and she would find a

895
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:51,440
way to say that it is irredeemably transphobic and white supremacist or something like that.

896
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:55,680
She can do those things that the activists always do. So nothing is ever good enough for her. She's

897
01:24:55,680 --> 01:25:00,400
also immensely privileged. She comes from well, independently wealthy background. She lives in,

898
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:08,960
you know, one of those sort of gated communities, which is 99% white. But she has a deep mistrust

899
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:16,480
of the working class. But she thinks that she is virtuous and noble and good, and she goes on

900
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:23,840
Twitter and it goes on the attack all the time, trying to isolate things, trying to save the

901
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:29,680
world in her through intersectional theory. And it's a very recognizable type of act,

902
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:33,440
even if you know nothing about intersectionality or anything of the stuff that came out of

903
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:36,720
the School of Thought of Kimberly Crenshaw or any of those academics, even if you know nothing

904
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:42,080
about that, you will recognize this type of figure because this figure is ubiquitous on Twitter,

905
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:48,080
on social media. They always have their pronouns in their bio. They always use the same terminology

906
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:53,680
such as hegemony or discourse or problematic or phallogocentric, if you want to go back to

907
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:59,360
Derrida, you know, and she knows the right jargon to use lived experience, cultural appropriation,

908
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:04,160
mansplaining, toxic masculinity, all of those kind of things. And we know, and all of these things

909
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:08,880
tend to be slogans in substitute of thought, you know, that they're just things that get thrown

910
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:13,840
out there. And so what I wanted to do with the character is in slogan means what do you mean

911
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:19,360
is etymologically? No, I don't sluag garrum. It means battle cry of the dead. I love that.

912
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:28,000
That doesn't send a chill up your back. You didn't understand it. Well, that's this is it.

913
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:34,640
I'm going to use that. That's great because that it is a kind of it's almost like a battleground

914
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:40,000
of zombies who don't have any capacity for independent thought anymore. I mean, you try

915
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,800
to get into a conversation with someone like this. And I have many times. Well, sure. Very

916
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:50,800
publicly. And the slogans that come back at you all the time. And the lack of interrogation of

917
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,880
those slogans, you know, but what I find so frustrating and so horrifying in some sense,

918
01:26:54,880 --> 01:27:00,080
I mean, I think a great canonical example of that is the interview that Helen Lewis did with me

919
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:06,720
for the for GQ, which is it's now more popular online than the Channel 4 interview, which I

920
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:12,240
think the GQ interview has like 32 million views or something preposterous. But I never

921
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:19,600
did talk to Helen Lewis. I just talked to the ideology and it's not I don't like that. I like

922
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:25,040
to talk to the person and find out what they think. But I heard you saying as well that

923
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:32,880
before the interview, she was very frosty and almost as though she had decided what you were

924
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:38,000
in advance, funnily enough. Oh, there was no almost. I definitely decided what I was before

925
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:43,680
the before the discussion. Yeah, exactly. And she's been beating the same drum more recently

926
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:48,560
as well, which has driven many people to the interview because she published an article in

927
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:54,400
the Atlantic Monthly and in another locale as well. So when you're faced with those, I mean,

928
01:27:54,960 --> 01:28:01,440
I just see it all the time so often. And to give another recent example that we had the obviously

929
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:06,640
since the Harry and Meghan interview with Oprah Winfrey. And there was a controversy over here

930
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:11,200
because Piers Morgan, who hosts a show called Good Morning Britain, got into an argument with

931
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:16,320
another colleague on the show, Mancoyl Alex Beresford, I think. And it was really interesting

932
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:20,480
watching once they'd had the argument, they sat down, they tried to talk through the issues.

933
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:23,920
And Piers Morgan pointed out that some of the things that Meghan had said in the interview

934
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:29,040
were factually wrong and had been proven to be factually wrong. His response was Alex Beresford's

935
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:33,280
response was, but that's her lived experience. And then he said, yes, but we have the evidence

936
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:37,680
here that it is factually incorrect. And again, he said, but it's her lived experience. So in other

937
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:43,520
words, see, that's that insistence that the fantasy world, the subjective world trumps everything.

938
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:50,240
Right. And that once you've, it's almost like these, these phrases, if you use the right, if you

939
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:53,600
use the phrase lived experience or toxic masculinity, whatever, you're in the club,

940
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:57,600
what you've signaled that you're, you're, you're right. You know, and I know that academics have

941
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,560
always done this, you know, the jargon, you're in the group, you're in the in-group, if you've

942
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:04,000
got the right, if you know how to deploy the right words. But there's something more sinister

943
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,960
about this because it is morally right in these situations. That's the sinister thing.

944
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:15,280
That's it. It's morally incontrovertible. You've made the statement and that's it. And there's

945
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:19,360
no further discussion. Yes, well, you're not evil. That's what you're saying. I'm not evil.

946
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:25,120
So I think, so with, so the reason with Titania, I wanted her to be obsessed with this language.

947
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:30,320
And so, and, and, and why I read so much of this stuff so that I knew the way that they speak

948
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:36,960
is because I thought the best way to expose the inherent contradictions of, of, of that position

949
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:42,640
and the thoughtlessness moreover, the thoughtlessness of that position is, is, is to, to embody it in

950
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:47,360
a character. Right. So you were playing, you were playing a dramatic game, essentially,

951
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:53,040
which is a form of thought. In doing so, I've actually come to understand the people I'm

952
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:57,360
satirizing a whole lot more. And look, let's face it, every now and then they'll hit on a point that

953
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:02,480
is actually right. And, and, you know, even when I read White Fragility by Robin D'Angelo, which I

954
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:06,320
think is a terrible book and is, is, is so flawed throughout every now and then she'll hit on something

955
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:10,320
and you think for a moment, oh, there's something in that. And then she'll undercut it by saying,

956
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:13,680
well, everyone's a racist and all the rest of it, you know, and it just goes back to being absurd.

957
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:19,040
But, and that book in of itself is a very good example of this, you know, setting up a reality

958
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:24,960
that cannot be penetrated because she will say that any kind of critical questioning of her

959
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:29,680
position is evidence of the very pervasiveness of white supremacy that she's identified. So you

960
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:34,720
can't win because even engaging in a discussion is proof of your malevolence, according to her

961
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:40,080
theory, it's absolutely hopeless. But I thought, I thought, I thought because the movement is so

962
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:45,680
riven with contradiction, actually, the more effective way of tackling it isn't through dialogue,

963
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:51,040
firstly, because the people I'm talking about seem impervious to reason. They mistrust dialogue,

964
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:54,640
they see debate as a form of violence. So you're never going to get through to them that way.

965
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:57,840
Yeah, and that that's actually an explicit part of the theory.

966
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:02,400
It really is. So then in creating a satirical character, it's not that they're anti free

967
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:08,000
speech, there's no such thing as free speech in that theoretical framework. No, it's a misapprehension

968
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,240
all the way down to the bottom, which is why I get so frustrated. I've often been in debates

969
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:16,880
where I've tried to invite these very people to participate in the debate to hear them out.

970
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:22,640
And they would say that to even appear would be to dignify the position. So it's an absolute

971
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:28,560
nightmare. And it also protects themselves from potential criticism, which is, of course,

972
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:33,360
the whole point. But I thought by creating a satirical character that embodies those

973
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:41,120
contradictions, that thoughtlessness, it might reflect back onto them. I suppose how they look

974
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:44,960
to normal people, because I don't think they appreciate, I think they're so caught up within

975
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:49,200
their own little bubbles, with their own little groups, they never hear an alternative point

976
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:53,920
of view. I mean, I used to work with academics like this, who were so within their little groups,

977
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:57,840
and they're constantly quoting each other and supporting each other and giving the illusion

978
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:03,920
that their views cannot be disputed. But what if you're suddenly confronted

979
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:08,000
with how other people perceive you? And will that give you pause for thought?

980
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:13,280
Okay, so when you started Titania, you didn't announce that she was a satirical character.

981
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:18,000
You started playing on Twitter. Tell me the story. What exactly would happen? Because

982
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:24,400
that Twitter account became extraordinarily well known and very rapidly. So I'm curious about

983
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:31,200
how you did that and how you responded once it started to amass some cultural significance.

984
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:39,600
I was very surprised that it became so popular so quickly. And I'd started it

985
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:44,000
because I'm more to entertain myself more than anything. I was so frustrated with this,

986
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:49,440
and I wanted to try and expose the absurdity of it. I mean, my background is a stand-up comic.

987
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:53,840
And as a stand-up comic, I'm not necessarily satirical. I will stand there on a stage

988
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:58,640
and ridicule the thing that I perceive to be a problem with society. With satire,

989
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:04,800
what you're doing is you're often embodying it with a kind of ironic detachment or you're addressing it.

990
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:09,040
You're always going after what you perceive to be the vices and follies of society,

991
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:13,200
and I thought that was a good way of doing it. Right, so you had to stay on a kind of edge.

992
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:19,040
You had to be believable enough as the character so that you could pass, but you had to push it

993
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:25,920
just past the point of what? Of rationality or believability? It's a funny edge.

994
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:29,840
I was continually getting into arguments with people and staying in character. I've always

995
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:34,800
stayed in character even to today. And I've actually, if you go to the Titania account now,

996
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:40,720
my pinned thread is a thread of conversations that I've had with people in character who are

997
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:44,720
angry about the things I've tweeted. And these can go on for pages and pages. And it's fascinating

998
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:50,160
to me because it's close enough to the truth. She says really ridiculous things, really absurd

999
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:55,760
things like speaking or writing in English as an act of colonial violence. She'll say that.

1000
01:33:56,560 --> 01:34:01,200
The only way to guard against fascism is if the state are allowed to arrest people for what they

1001
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:06,560
say and think. Stuff like this, which is so obviously absurd, and yet it's close enough

1002
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:12,000
to what people actually say that people believe it and get annoyed about it. And what I've always

1003
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:18,560
liked to do is to stay in character and have those conversations with these people. And then

1004
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:24,080
I posted the screenshots of the conversation. But part of the point of that is not to humiliate the

1005
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:28,240
people who had fallen for it, because actually the point I'm making is I understand why they would

1006
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:35,360
fall for it because it's so close to what people actually say. And by doing that, my hope is,

1007
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:41,760
I suppose, that it exposes the folly of this stuff. Sometimes even when I'm in those arguments,

1008
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:46,880
I will say something that is so out of the, out of, you know, just completely out of the realm

1009
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:54,560
of possibility, so stupid. And yet they still don't, things have become so absurd that they don't

1010
01:34:55,440 --> 01:35:01,200
twig. I mean, even today, there was a story today in the UK, a museum, a Jane Austen museum,

1011
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:06,640
is now going to interrogate Jane Austen's use of sugar in her tea, because it has connections to

1012
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:11,280
plantations and white supremacy and slavery. You know, something like that, which is just so

1013
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:17,440
absurd, or the recent controversy over Bluey, the Australian cartoon dog, because it doesn't have

1014
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:23,360
enough dogs of color and gender diverse dogs in the cartoon. Now, that sounds like something I would

1015
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:29,040
make up as a joke. But it's real, it's actually happening and people are taking it seriously.

1016
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:34,480
And so therefore, in a sense, it's become harder with Titania, because anything that I come up with

1017
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:39,840
is going to be topped by real life very, very quickly.

1018
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:45,920
So what have you learned about the people that Titania annoys? So she's a hyper politically

1019
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:53,120
correct avatar, and but she tangles up people who are opposed to that sort of thing. And so that

1020
01:35:53,120 --> 01:36:00,720
must have also shed substantial light for you on people on the other side of the, and so what have

1021
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:06,320
you learned? Well, one of the things is that the people on the other side, who might even be quite,

1022
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:12,320
might even be of my opinion about these things. A lot of people are very quick to anger,

1023
01:36:13,120 --> 01:36:20,560
and verbal abuse as a goat, as an instant response. So a lot of the people who get

1024
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:26,000
angry with her really go after her looks. And I mean, she's not real, a friend of mine, Lisa,

1025
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:30,960
created the image of the woman is just a composite of four different women. So it's not a parody.

1026
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:34,400
You see, this is the thing, it's not a parody of any particular person, it's a, it's a type of,

1027
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:40,800
of person. And yeah, the people who get angry with her and the people who are genuinely angry

1028
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:45,600
about the social justice movement are absolutely furious about the way it is impinging on every

1029
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:49,280
aspect of their lives, they are sick of it. So when they see someone as extreme as Titania,

1030
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:53,120
they really let rip. And I don't think that's healthy. You know, it's not in my nature to go

1031
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:59,920
and abuse someone online or to get angry online. But I've seen the extent, what it shows, I suppose,

1032
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:06,480
is that that kind of instinct to immediately go for the abusive or the vicious or the attack

1033
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:12,640
or the ad hominem is present across the political spectrum. It's everywhere. Or maybe that's just

1034
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:20,080
a sign of Twitter, maybe that's just a symptom of social media. And I've learned a lot about

1035
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:23,920
how social media works. I think that's, that's another thing about it is that I've really,

1036
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:29,440
for one thing, the fact that she's, she's been banned a number of times and I've learned how

1037
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:36,000
to avoid the bans and about the way that big tech censors and how they censor and why.

1038
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:41,920
What if, what does she be banned for? So the tweets that she was banned for a couple of times,

1039
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:46,880
she's had a number of one day suspensions, a number of seven day suspensions. Once or twice,

1040
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:52,240
it's been inexplicable to me why, why she would be banned. It seems a bit like someone at Silicon

1041
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:56,480
Valley has twigged that their precious ideology is being mocked and they don't like it. That,

1042
01:37:56,480 --> 01:38:01,440
that's the only explanation I could think of. However, on a couple of instances, it's when she's,

1043
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:06,080
I suppose, what they would say incited violence. And of course, she hasn't done anything of the

1044
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:11,280
kind. There was one tweet where she said she was going to go to a UKIP rally. UKIP is a right-wing

1045
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:15,920
nationalist political party in the UK. And she said, I'm going to go to this UKIP rally to punch

1046
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:20,160
people in the name of compassion or love or something like that, you know, which is the idea

1047
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:25,520
that a lot of these activists have that actually, whereas words are violence and awful, actual

1048
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:30,720
physical violence can be defended, you know, in their, in their view, it's so perverse. And of course,

1049
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:36,560
I was making a comment about the perversity of that idea that you think microaggressions are,

1050
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:41,040
are actual violence, but you're perfectly content to go out and set fire to cars and beat

1051
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:44,320
people up if they have the wrong opinion or pepper spray people in the face if they voted for

1052
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:47,840
Trump. You know, there's an obvious, there's an obvious contradiction there that I was

1053
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:51,680
trying to expose. So she had a ban there. I think that might have even been the one where

1054
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:56,160
she was permanently banned. I had an email from Twitter saying, this is a permanent ban,

1055
01:38:56,160 --> 01:39:00,560
you're not getting back on. And then there was a bit of an outcry from, from, from people who

1056
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:05,120
follow her, some prominent people who follow her, and Twitter rescinded that changed their minds

1057
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:09,600
and brought her back. And as a result of that, inevitably, her follower count leapt because

1058
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:13,280
of course, when you try and censor something, you draw attention to it, but you're always treading

1059
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:17,680
a fine line. I mean, my friend, Lisa, who I mentioned, Lisa Graves used to have a Twitter

1060
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:22,320
account called Jarvis de Pong, who was one of my favorite accounts on Twitter. And he was

1061
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:27,360
banned, completely permanently banned. They actually went on a bit of a purge of satire

1062
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:33,120
accounts. There was one afternoon where Twitter purged 12 or 13 satirical accounts and deleted

1063
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:38,400
them. Titania came back for some reason, I think it's because she was the bigger account.

1064
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:42,960
But a lot of them just got ditched. And that I think shows that, you know, the powers that

1065
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:47,040
be at Silicon Valley, they don't like to be mocked. They don't, well, no one in authority likes to

1066
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:51,520
be mocked. It's the best way to undermine authority, isn't it? And it's, it's why every despot in

1067
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:57,200
history has killed the clown. Well, that's why we have to be so careful when any of our laws

1068
01:39:57,200 --> 01:40:02,240
start making comedians nervous. They're the ultimate canary in the coal mine.

1069
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:06,960
Even more so than artists, I think. The artists are next, probably, but.

1070
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:11,440
Absolutely. I mean, you, you'll know in Canada, Mike Ward was fined, I think $42,000

1071
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:16,560
by the Quebec Human Rights Commission for a joke that he told, if you, and by the way, if you,

1072
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:20,000
you know, this is not. Yes, and Montreal, of course, has one of the world's great comedy

1073
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:24,400
festivals. And, and some of that humor, I've been to the comedy festival a couple of times,

1074
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:30,320
and at midnight, you can go and hear particularly outrageous comedy, which I actually think it

1075
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:35,280
was one of those where he said what he got fined for. And I, you know, I don't even know the

1076
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:39,360
context because he said it in French for one thing. So I don't fully understand. But I read

1077
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:44,000
the transcript and I spoke to him about it. And what was interesting is that he's not some,

1078
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:48,240
you know, open Mike Act who's, who doesn't, hasn't been on the set. He's an established,

1079
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:53,600
famous, successful comedian who was, who was fined for a joke that if you actually break

1080
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:58,560
it down and analyze it, there's nothing remotely offensive about it. You know, I mean, it's

1081
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:03,360
perfectly, I don't think comedy can, can exist without the potential to cause offense.

1082
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:10,480
No, neither can truth. Right, quite. Comedy is almost always truth, almost always.

1083
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:14,880
That comedian says something funny and it's true in a way that people didn't expect and they know it.

1084
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:22,080
Well, it's also that, it's also that thing of, of, of, of teasing the boundaries of tolerance,

1085
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:26,640
of, of, of almost, almost having that kind of cathartic effect, the way that the, the ancient

1086
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:30,800
Greeks would watch a tragedy and, and hear about this dismemberment and all sorts of

1087
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:37,200
vying to philosophically to purge themselves of the, of that evil that lay within. In a sense,

1088
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:42,960
when you hear a comedian say something utterly outrageous, it can have that effect on you and

1089
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:47,200
you laugh in spite of yourself. And then you laugh again, because you are saying to yourself,

1090
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:50,080
why did I laugh at that? That makes me, I shouldn't have done that. So you're almost

1091
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:54,240
laughing at your own response as well. It has a double effect. And we are really losing that.

1092
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:59,520
I mean, I don't know how it is in Canada, but, but, but in the UK, a lot of this kind of

1093
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:03,280
mistrust of comedy and mistrust of jokes and the idea that certain jokes

1094
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:07,200
normalize hatred is coming from the comedians themselves. And a lot of comedians

1095
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:12,080
take it on themselves to police other comedians' material and they get very angry

1096
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:17,440
when people broach certain subjects. I consider it very, very unhealthy. And not all comedians,

1097
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:21,040
by the way, I'm not saying that all comedians, I'm just saying, certainly the more establishment

1098
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:25,520
comedians absolutely would fall into this category. And it's, it's really shocked me. This has been,

1099
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:30,800
since I started to Tanya in particular, a lot of comedians have been very angry that I mocked

1100
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:36,080
the social justice movement or, you know, that I, you know, which to me is a bit absurd, because,

1101
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:41,680
you know, I spent years, three years writing, co-writing the Jonathan Pye character. And because

1102
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:48,000
that predominantly mocked Trump and the right and conservatives. And, and, you know, it went,

1103
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:53,440
those were the targets, that was okay. So I never got this kind of venom about, about that. But as

1104
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:58,080
soon as I was mocking social justice ideology, which I perceived to be an extremely powerful

1105
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:02,480
ideology, you know, this isn't, I don't think I'm punching down. I think I'm punching up at these,

1106
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:06,800
at these, at these people who have captured these institutions and, and are ruthless, by the way,

1107
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:11,120
absolutely ruthless and bullying. I think the social justice movement utterly legitimizes bullying.

1108
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:14,880
And I don't like bullies. And I like to stand up to bullies. And that to Tanya is my attempt to

1109
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:19,440
stand up against the bullies. But what they will do is misrepresent my intentions and will say,

1110
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:24,000
oh, no, you just want to have a go at gay people or whatever, or have a go at minority groups. And,

1111
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:29,520
and I've been very shocked by that, because that, that kind of response has even come from comedians.

1112
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:34,640
And my view is that if you've got half a brain, you know, that's not what I'm doing. You, I mean,

1113
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:39,680
you absolutely have to know that that's what not what I'm doing. And yet, maybe they do know, maybe

1114
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:44,160
they, maybe this is a willfulness interpretation as a means to attack me, because I've, because I've

1115
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:48,880
mocked the ideology I'm not meant to mock. But I tell you what, whenever there's, whenever there

1116
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:52,640
are consequences for mocking someone, then I think that's the person you ought to be mocking, right?

1117
01:43:52,640 --> 01:44:02,640
I think that's a sign. Do you, would you, what effect has producing to Tanya had on your life?

1118
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:06,880
And, and if you could go back and decide whether you were going to do it again, would you?

1119
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:12,800
I mean, it must be shocking. I would think it's shocking to have, have seen what happened

1120
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:17,920
to be at the center of what happened when you created that character. But I'd like to know.

1121
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:23,200
I, well, for one thing, I didn't, yeah, I didn't expect the reaction that I got. Also,

1122
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:27,920
you've got to remember that for a long time, the character I was anonymous. Because I, I,

1123
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:31,520
part of the effects of the character was that people thought she was real. That was so

1124
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:37,200
sort of integral to it. And then I was outed by a newspaper over here the week that her first

1125
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:42,480
book came out. And that although that was very good for the books, it generated a lot of publicity,

1126
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:47,120
because then the story became that I was the person behind the character. In effect, it had

1127
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:52,080
an innovating impact on the, on the, on the character, because now what happens, people know

1128
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:55,920
it's me behind the character, people. However, what I will say is even to this day, there's

1129
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:58,640
always some people who fall for it whenever I tweet something, there's always some people

1130
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:03,600
who fall for it. So it has that. So, so there's that. But then there's the impact on my personal

1131
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:11,920
life. Well, I would do it again, because I feel very passionately that the, the, the movement

1132
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:16,560
that I'm mocking, the ideology that I'm mocking is a dangerous one. And I feel very passionately

1133
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:24,560
that it is divisive and damaging to society as damaging as any ideology can be. I think it has

1134
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:31,840
the potential to go to those lengths. And, and so that I think I would almost be in dereliction if

1135
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:35,840
I, if I didn't mock it, it would be, it would be, I tell you what it would be, it would be an act of

1136
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:40,400
self censorship, if I didn't go after these targets. And that's by the way, how most comedians, I mean,

1137
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:43,440
a lot of comedians think this stuff is ridiculous. They won't go near it because they know that if

1138
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:46,960
they do, they won't get on the BBC and they won't get booked by certain clubs. So they just leave

1139
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:53,520
it well alone. But I think I couldn't do, I could, I just, that's not in my nature. So I,

1140
01:45:54,160 --> 01:46:00,800
so I don't regret that. The fact that so many friends of mine, former friends on the company

1141
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:05,680
circuit no longer talk to me, that's something which I suppose I could say is unfortunate.

1142
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:10,560
On the other hand, how many times has that happened to you? How many friends do you think

1143
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:15,840
you've lost? It's in double figures. It's certainly in double figures. And I think,

1144
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:22,640
and it's not just Tanya, it's also partly, I suppose, my politics. It's also,

1145
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:30,960
it's effectively being honest about what I think and saying opinions that might not be the establishment

1146
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:36,560
of fashionable opinions. And it gets people very angry. I mean, one particular incident I could

1147
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:40,240
think of was when I met for a drink with two friends, very old friends of mine, a married

1148
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:45,920
couple. And he started screaming at me in the pub, I won't swear on your podcast, but calling me

1149
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:49,440
an effing Nazi. And then another word, which I probably shouldn't say at this point.

1150
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:56,720
But, and I thought he was joking at first. And we had this conversation. And it was true. He'd,

1151
01:46:56,720 --> 01:47:02,960
he'd completely bought into this fantasy of who I was. And, and there was no going back from that.

1152
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:07,280
And I know it was fueled by alcohol, but no apology was forthcoming or no,

1153
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:12,080
you know, it's, and then every now and then there'll be, I mean, it happened to be a couple of

1154
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:15,920
months ago, we're a comedian I've known for many, many years from the circuit, suddenly sent me

1155
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:21,200
this abusive message online on Twitter and started attacking me and saying I was, he said I was

1156
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:29,920
funded by dark foreign powers or something utterly absurd, you know, and, and I thought, well, okay,

1157
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:34,400
so this is now- Of course, that is what you'd say if you were funded by dark foreign powers.

1158
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:38,240
Well, this is, this is the problem. Like I said, you know, I've said it before, like, if, you know,

1159
01:47:38,240 --> 01:47:41,520
if I am getting all this dark money, it must be very dark because I haven't seen any of it. It's

1160
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:46,960
not, you know, that'd be great. Fine. But I'm not. And this idea that I'm this sort of, it's that

1161
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:51,280
going right back to what you said at the start, like that I'm defending free speech, because I,

1162
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:55,680
I, because I'm an evil person who wants to say evil things. And so there's all of that.

1163
01:47:56,480 --> 01:48:00,560
All that I'm mocking, I'm mocking minority groups through to Tanya, which is absolutely not what

1164
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:07,520
I'm doing. It's the opposite. I'm mocking those very affluent and powerful people who very patronizingly

1165
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:11,760
assume that they, they, they know what's best for minorities, you know, it's the opposite of what

1166
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:19,920
people say it is. But these kind of experiences, on the one hand, I think it's a bit sad, isn't

1167
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:24,560
it? Because there are people now, I've had to go through my phone and delete lots of numbers,

1168
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:29,200
because I know we'll never talk again. But on the other hand, were they my friends to begin with?

1169
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:35,200
I'm not so sure, you know, if they can, if they can suddenly become so bigoted. And that is the

1170
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:40,080
word. Well, it's an indication of how profound the divide has started to become in our culture,

1171
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:45,920
right? That I mean, 20 years ago, I never lost any friends because of my hypothetical political

1172
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:52,560
opinions. But things have changed. You must have lost your, your case must be much more severe than

1173
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:58,000
mine. You know, because you're so much more famous and so much more known has have lots of friends

1174
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:05,920
turned on you. No, actually, not a lot. Some, there's some outstanding exceptions, although even

1175
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:10,400
in those situations, I would say there was extenuating circumstances. No, I've been,

1176
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:17,760
I've been really fortunate in that regard that my, my close circle of, of intimates my family and

1177
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:23,040
my, my close friends have been staggeringly loyal to me under. Which is wonderful.

1178
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:27,840
Severe distress. Yes. That's wonderful. So is it maybe the case? Does that tell us

1179
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:32,400
that actually what it's really about is the fact that I was working in an industry,

1180
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:38,480
which is, you know, the, the comedy industry is so on board with the woke ideology to such an

1181
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:44,640
extent that in fact, so many of it's, it's so many comedians are now really just

1182
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:50,400
advertised for that, for that ideology, maybe. Maybe. I mean, my professional colleagues certainly

1183
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:54,080
haven't leapt to my defense. Well, that's, that's what I was going to ask, actually. Yes.

1184
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:59,200
Surely. No, that's been, no, that's pretty much done with. I mean, I would say my name,

1185
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:04,640
I've decided this recently because of the slurs that have been associated with me.

1186
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:12,960
I can't in good conscience accept graduate students anymore. Because if they go out, you know,

1187
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:18,800
you talked at the beginning about this register where that's been set up in Britain, where if you

1188
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:27,360
are charged, accused of a non-crime hate act, it's recorded without a trial. I mean, I've been on

1189
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:34,000
hiring committees many, many times. And especially in academia, there's an oversupply of highly

1190
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:40,800
qualified people, of radical oversupply. And so if there's anything in your record at all that's

1191
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:47,600
the least bit contentious, it's like you're, you're done. And so being my student, that's not

1192
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:53,600
a little bit contentious. That's really, really contentious. And so it's now become impossible

1193
01:50:53,600 --> 01:51:01,360
for me to, to, to serve my proper function as a, as a scientist and as a university professor. So

1194
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:07,200
that's, it's taking a lot of adjustment on my part to get accustomed to that. And I don't practice

1195
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:13,280
clinically anymore as well. And there are a variety of reasons for that. But certainly the,

1196
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:22,400
I've become very, very susceptible to attacks through the College of Psychologists,

1197
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:30,080
the governing board. They can make the life of a practitioner brutally miserable with a single

1198
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:39,520
letter. And that's very, very punishing. And it's also perhaps not necessarily good for my

1199
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:44,560
potential clients to be associated with someone who's controversial. They already have enough

1200
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:50,720
trouble. So although I've been fortunate on the family and friends front, the, on the professional

1201
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:58,000
front, things have, have been, you know, more dismal. Isn't that just suggestive of the, of the,

1202
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:02,720
the power of this movement and, and the effectiveness of cancel culture? In fact,

1203
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:08,480
the way, the ease with which people can become stigmatized, you know, all it takes is a few

1204
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:13,760
accusations of your far right or alt-right or whatever. And it's there, you know, any prospective

1205
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:18,160
employer can Google that and it comes up and who's going to take the risk? You know, the accusation

1206
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:25,040
is sufficient to damn you. And, and that's, that's what. Well, that you put the finger on the, on

1207
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:31,760
the absolute catastrophe of the non-crime hate index. It's like, well, it's, it's a permanent

1208
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:37,840
stain, especially in a, in a technological universe where nothing is ever forgotten,

1209
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:43,360
no matter how long the lag. And it's worse because the government here feels no compunction

1210
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:50,800
to address this or to no politician seem to has, well, I suppose they are, well, because the strategy

1211
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:54,720
is that if you oppose hate speech laws, you're obviously a hateful person. Why else would you

1212
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:58,160
oppose hate speech law? You know, it's the old thing and, and a politician doesn't want to stand

1213
01:52:58,160 --> 01:53:02,160
up in parliament to be the one who is seen to be siding with the evil guys, the bad guys.

1214
01:53:02,160 --> 01:53:06,720
So you have to make a very, very subtle argument to stand up against hate speech laws because

1215
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:12,320
you're faced with the problem that there is such a thing as hate speech. Yeah. Obviously. So when

1216
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:18,960
it's pernicious and terrible, it's like, okay. So you're arguing uphill. This is again why it's

1217
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:25,040
such a bloody miracle that we ever had free speech to begin with. It's almost inconceivable to me that

1218
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:32,560
we managed to generate the baseline presumption of innocence. That's a miracle. The fact that you

1219
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:38,960
can go bankrupt and start again, that's a miracle. The idea that you ever had free speech and that

1220
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:45,600
that was genuinely the case, that's a miracle. And none of this is given the appropriate respect

1221
01:53:45,600 --> 01:53:51,600
and awe that it deserves because it's so unlikely. It's hugely unlikely. I mean, I know in the book,

1222
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:56,480
I talk about, I give a kind of very, very short history of free speech from the ancient Greeks

1223
01:53:56,480 --> 01:54:02,000
to today. And the point of that is to accentuate this point that actually the fact that we have it

1224
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:07,360
is astonishing and unlikely, so unlikely. And all the more reason why we need to defend it,

1225
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:14,000
we need to be really, really vigilant about any cracks that appear in this, because it will go

1226
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:18,560
away very, very easily, you know, if we don't defend it. And it's hard, particularly when it comes to

1227
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:25,040
the idea of, that's why I wrote a chapter on hate speech, because, and took the other side's view

1228
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:30,000
seriously, because just trashing the opposing argument isn't going to help. We have to talk

1229
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:34,880
about it and explain why it's important nevertheless. Well, for one thing, like you say,

1230
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:40,800
hateful speech exists. Let's start from that point. Let's acknowledge that that hateful speech exists,

1231
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:46,480
and it can be hurtful, and it can do damage. But then the alternative is a state that might,

1232
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:51,440
in the future, be completely unscrupulous, that is going to decide for you what you can say. And

1233
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:55,840
those are the things that we have to tackle. And the other key thing is that no one knows how to

1234
01:54:55,840 --> 01:55:01,360
define hate speech. You know, UNESCO, the European Court of Human Rights, they've all agreed,

1235
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:05,760
there's no way to define hate speech. Every European country that has hate speech laws

1236
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:10,720
has different hate speech laws, different definitions, subjective, abstract concepts,

1237
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:15,680
such as hate, such as offence, such as a perception, you know, and these are on the

1238
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:18,720
statute books, and you don't want this stuff on the statute books, because it's all very well.

1239
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:23,120
I mean, I know the, we talked about the SMP and their hate crime bill, the defense I'm always

1240
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:28,400
running into, is people are saying, yes, okay, technically, someone could be arrested and imprisoned

1241
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:34,000
for saying some, an offensive joke, technically, yes. But no one in their right mind, no jury,

1242
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:40,880
no judge is going to, we've got common sense, it's okay. Well, that's so myopic. I mean,

1243
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:44,320
what, because you don't know who's going to be in charge in 10 years time. You don't know who

1244
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:48,720
that judge is going to be. How can you possibly just... You can be certain that someone will be

1245
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:55,920
in charge that doesn't approve of you and that you don't approve of, that will, that will certainly

1246
01:55:55,920 --> 01:56:03,600
happen. You don't want vague, vague wording on the statute books. It's going to be exploited

1247
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:07,280
at some point, even though, even if it's not today, there's absolutely no way that you can

1248
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:13,360
guarantee it against future, against the future abuses of that. And I don't, it is, as you say,

1249
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:20,400
it's a certainty. So I think it's actually one of the most important arguments that we should make

1250
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:26,560
and that free speech needs to be defended in every successive generation. It's not something that

1251
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:31,600
you know this, you get it and then it's there forever. No, that's not true. There's something

1252
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:36,080
about human nature. There's something about people in power. There's something about the way that we

1253
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:45,280
are that it will collapse. It's an edifice that is not secure at any given time. But it's hard.

1254
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:49,600
It's that thing of being smeared. The risk is you're going to be smeared. You're going to be

1255
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:53,360
associated with the worst possible kinds of people because, of course, it's only really

1256
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:56,960
controversial speech that ever requires protection. And people are going to say,

1257
01:56:57,760 --> 01:57:02,640
well, then you must support what these awful people are saying. And it's hard to make the case.

1258
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:06,480
But it's a case that nonetheless has to be made. And particularly by politicians,

1259
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:11,440
I've been incredibly disappointed by the way in which politicians in this country have not

1260
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:18,000
made any kind of effort to, if anything, as from what I can see, there are moves even in the

1261
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,880
English parliament to push through further hate speech laws. We should be repealing them,

1262
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:24,400
not pushing for them. But no one wants to have the argument. No one wants to be tainted.

1263
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:28,800
Yeah, well, they get identified one by one and taken out. That's what happens.

1264
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:33,840
Where you get put on a list. This is it. The identitarian left, if that's what we're going

1265
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:36,880
to call them. I don't know what to call them. That's the problem. They're very clever about

1266
01:57:36,880 --> 01:57:42,160
evading even a label. But they like making their lists. They like observing and saying,

1267
01:57:42,160 --> 01:57:50,160
you know, you are problematic. You have sinned. And now they have an electronic trail.

1268
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:54,800
These are the people that absolutely love going through all of your old tweets and messages

1269
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:59,920
and anything they can find. And of course, the point about that is you can do that to anyone.

1270
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:03,920
There is no one alive who, if you had complete unfettered access to everything they've ever

1271
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:07,600
written online or in their emails or text messages, that you couldn't construct a

1272
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:11,680
case to dam someone. That's actually one of the things that's more or less saved me.

1273
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:18,000
Is that right? Well, by the time I made my political statement, which was a philosophical

1274
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:23,600
statement or even a spiritual statement, not a political statement, I already had 200 hours of

1275
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:29,440
lectures online. And so essentially everything I'd ever said to students was recorded. And

1276
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:36,320
it wasn't possible to pull out a smoking pistol. This was very smart. And also, I mean,

1277
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:41,680
but this is why it's also astonishing. I find it unendingly astonishing the way you are mischaracterized

1278
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:46,240
because it's all there. Everything you think is out in the open. You've been very, very,

1279
01:58:46,240 --> 01:58:51,360
very clear and explicit about your point of view. And so when they try and demonize you and turn

1280
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:54,560
you into this thing, people can check and they'll realize that you're there. I think what they're

1281
01:58:54,560 --> 01:59:00,000
doing is they're relying on the reputational damage being a kind of barrier to people even

1282
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:05,040
investigating who you really are. Yeah, well, to some degree, that that works. But it doesn't

1283
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:11,200
really work because what genuine generally happens is that, you know, for every person who

1284
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:17,120
wouldn't open a lecture because of my reputation, there's three or four who do because they're

1285
01:59:17,120 --> 01:59:23,920
curious. And then it has an even more perverse effect on, in some cases, on the true believers

1286
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:30,800
because they're primed to find anything I said offensive, but that doesn't happen,

1287
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:34,960
or maybe they even find it useful. And then that's not good at all. It's like, well,

1288
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:40,560
it's not interesting when you meet the people, when you get into conversation with people and

1289
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:45,280
you can see that you're not what they thought you were. And they don't know quite what to do with

1290
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:51,760
that. And that to me is why another reason why we need more speech, not less, we need to have

1291
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:56,160
the conversation so that people can be disabused of the fantasies that they've been wallowing in.

1292
01:59:56,880 --> 02:00:01,840
But I do very much enjoy that when people expect one thing and then they actually

1293
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:08,400
speak to me and they don't see that, that there's no evidence of it because it doesn't exist.

1294
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:12,640
Yeah, well, it's interesting to watch that unfold in the public domain too. I mentioned those two

1295
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:19,520
interviews, the Channel 4 interview that is being viral and the interview by Helen Lewis at GQ.

1296
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:26,320
Those interviews basically consist of nothing but

1297
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:34,000
the attempt by the interlocutor to have a conversation with the person that exists in

1298
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,240
their imagination. Right, but what's the point of that?

1299
02:00:36,240 --> 02:00:40,240
There's almost no relationship to me at all. That was particularly the case with

1300
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:47,600
Cathy Newman and was less so with Helen Lewis, but that was still essentially the issue.

1301
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:52,160
It's quite reassuring, though, isn't it, that once it's out there, people can see through it?

1302
02:00:52,880 --> 02:01:01,200
It's very reassuring. What saved me, and this has given me an endless supply of hope, I would say,

1303
02:01:01,200 --> 02:01:07,840
is that all I've ever had to do is just show everything. It's like, here's the situation,

1304
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:18,720
no edits. This is what happened, and every time so far, I haven't been fatally damaged.

1305
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:25,840
Yeah, I mean, one of the things I've learned most, I think, since Tatania kicked off and

1306
02:01:26,640 --> 02:01:33,200
it became a known thing, is I've learned simply never to trust the perception of someone as

1307
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:41,200
as constructed in the media or online. It's never the same person. I've ended up

1308
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:45,680
coming from the background I did. Most of my friends were always on the left. I didn't really

1309
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:49,760
know conservative people, and now I have a lot of friends who are conservatives,

1310
02:01:50,640 --> 02:01:55,360
and they're just not this villain that they were made out to be, and even some famous

1311
02:01:55,360 --> 02:01:58,880
conservatives who people have said they're absolute monsters, they're evil, they want to eat babies,

1312
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:03,120
basically, or the equivalent, and you get to know them, and you realize, oh my goodness,

1313
02:02:03,120 --> 02:02:11,040
the perception is so far removed from the reality that even I once had bought into it myself,

1314
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:15,040
because everyone's telling you this. Yeah, the same thing. I certainly had that experience

1315
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:20,800
repeatedly, repeatedly. I never trust it now. Whenever I hear the way people talk about people

1316
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:25,520
online, I never trust it. Unless I know someone personally, I'm never going to trust that again.

1317
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:34,080
I think that's an important lesson for me. What's next for you? Also, how do you make a living?

1318
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:38,560
You can't make a living as Detainee McGrath. I mean, you're locked down still, so it's

1319
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:44,880
got to be hard being a comedian. Right. Well, comedy came to an end. I did a

1320
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:53,600
tour, I did a stand-up comedy tour in early 2019, and that was really the last big thing I did,

1321
02:02:53,600 --> 02:02:59,280
because as soon as I was about to do some more live performances, the lockdown came, and it's

1322
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:02,960
the same. I'm not complaining, because absolutely every live performer has the identical experience,

1323
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:09,600
and we've all, you know, I'm not in a position to complain. Yeah, it's a very good question.

1324
02:03:09,600 --> 02:03:14,720
I like it, because it's also very direct. How do I make my money? Well, I write articles for

1325
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:22,960
various publications. There's the Titania books have kept me going. I obviously used to work on

1326
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:27,680
the Jonathan Pye character. We had a couple of television shows and live tours. Those were

1327
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:31,600
particularly lucrative. And for a long time, I did just make my money as a stand-up comic,

1328
02:03:31,600 --> 02:03:37,600
so literally just the money I would make from the circuit. Now, I've just got a job with,

1329
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:46,560
well, it's, you know, I gave up being a full-time teacher for this, and I was on a regular wage.

1330
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:53,760
It was a good salary, and I left it at great risk, you know, because I don't come from a wealthy

1331
02:03:53,760 --> 02:04:00,400
family. I don't have the means to support myself without this kind of stuff. So I went, well,

1332
02:04:00,400 --> 02:04:05,040
I actually went part-time first and was on the stand-up circuit. And then I started earning

1333
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:10,960
enough from the stand-up to get by. And so I went full-time stand-up, but I was really,

1334
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:16,000
I was genuinely struggling financially for a long time. And then Jonathan Pye happened,

1335
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:20,880
which was very successful, particularly because we had a big viral hit around the time of the

1336
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:24,560
Donald Trump election, which actually went viral in America as well. And that really helped

1337
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:27,680
broaden the character. And then we did live tours and all the rest of it. We played the

1338
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:33,200
London Palladium and the Hammersmith Apollo. And so it was a big thing for me. And then Tatania

1339
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:38,080
happened, and the book did very well, and the second book did well. And how many copies do you,

1340
02:04:38,080 --> 02:04:41,280
you don't have to tell me, obviously, but how many copies? I don't know. Actually, the truth is,

1341
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:45,200
I don't know. That's something I should ask at some point. It's the sort of thing I don't look

1342
02:04:45,200 --> 02:04:51,520
into. You know, I got a royalty check the other day, and I thought, I thought it was done. And

1343
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:55,600
actually, this was quite a lot of money. I thought, okay, that's good. This is something that can

1344
02:04:55,600 --> 02:05:02,240
keep me going. But I've also just got a new job as a broadcaster on a new channel called GB News

1345
02:05:02,240 --> 02:05:11,600
in the UK. And that will be a pretty full-time, full-on presenter job. But what's good about

1346
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:16,400
that job is, you know, I think we have a real problem with the news media in this country is

1347
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:20,800
that we don't have enough diversity of thought and the conversations that we ought to be having.

1348
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:24,880
This gives me an opportunity to do that. So it's very much related to the work I've been doing.

1349
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:31,200
But in addition, I'm going to continue with my comedy work and Tatania. We're doing some live

1350
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:36,400
shows with Tatania, played by an actress. We did that just before the lockdown. We had to postpone

1351
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:43,280
the tour. Now we're going to do another one. So I will, yeah, a lot of people get very scared by

1352
02:05:44,080 --> 02:05:46,960
making a living as a creative person because you're always on the line.

1353
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:49,840
As they should be. Jesus, it's a tough way to make a living, man.

1354
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:54,720
It really, I mean, you're taking a massive risk. And most creatives I know are very,

1355
02:05:54,720 --> 02:05:57,840
very poor. You know, it's simply not, and most have other jobs, you know.

1356
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:01,520
Yeah, there's a tiny fraction that are hyper-rich and everyone else starves.

1357
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:06,000
Virtually no one. And I consider myself extremely fortunate to be able to do this full,

1358
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:10,480
the stuff I love, full-time. Because for most of my adult career, I couldn't.

1359
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:15,120
And I was, you know, I had to have a full-time job and as well as go out in the evenings

1360
02:06:15,120 --> 02:06:22,960
and do all of this stuff. And so it's a real, you have to really commit. And you also have to be

1361
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:27,920
aware in the back of your mind of the likelihood of failure. That's, you know,

1362
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:33,200
that's the other thing that you have to be fully aware of. And I'm by no means taken for granted.

1363
02:06:33,200 --> 02:06:38,880
You know, I think I'm, you know, it's the stuff I've done comedy into Tanya and the book I've

1364
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:45,120
just written is that none of this stuff would make me rich. It would keep me going. The new job

1365
02:06:45,120 --> 02:06:49,040
I've got is going to be a more regular income, which is something I miss. I haven't had this

1366
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:52,560
since I was a teacher. I missed that. You know, I missed routine and all the rest of it.

1367
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:58,560
Yeah, well, another complicating factor is not only if you're trying to exist creatively,

1368
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:06,480
not only is it a very high-risk proposition financially, but you lack that psychological

1369
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:13,040
comfort that comes from routine, which, you know, people, artistic people often

1370
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:19,520
are hypercritical of routine, but God, man, routine keeps you sane and trying to invent

1371
02:07:19,520 --> 02:07:24,880
yourself every day. That's not for the faint hearted. I've seen very few people manage that

1372
02:07:24,880 --> 02:07:31,920
successfully across decades. No, absolutely. And I think particularly in comedy, you know,

1373
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:35,360
because you have to work for about three or four years on the circuit without getting paid anything.

1374
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:38,400
In fact, you're losing money because you're paying for your travel expenses and then you get

1375
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:43,360
somewhere and you don't get paid for it. And this is why a lot, you'll find a lot of comedians,

1376
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:49,120
particularly in the UK, are from quite wealthy backgrounds or privately educated because they

1377
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:52,640
have rich parents who can help them out, put them up in a flat and they don't have to work

1378
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:57,600
during the day. And they escalate much quicker through the ranks. But if you come from my sort

1379
02:07:57,600 --> 02:08:02,080
of background, you can't do that. You have to have the job. And then you have to, it's like

1380
02:08:02,080 --> 02:08:07,760
having two jobs. And so you have to really care about it. I mean, my advice is always that I do

1381
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:14,400
believe, although it comes with that insecurity, if it is a vocation for you, you have to do it.

1382
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:19,200
I mean, for me, I couldn't have done anything. It is a genuine vocation for me, even if I

1383
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:24,640
were making no money whatsoever, out of comedy or writing or the rest, I would still be doing it

1384
02:08:24,640 --> 02:08:29,360
because I would feel unfulfilled if I were not doing it. I think there's something also quite,

1385
02:08:29,360 --> 02:08:33,280
I mean, I take your point about the practicalities of living and the business of living. But my

1386
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:37,760
God, I think depriving yourself of your vocation can be so soul destroying.

1387
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:43,040
No, it is. Well, I've spent a lot of time studying creativity scientifically. And

1388
02:08:43,760 --> 02:08:50,640
the first thing that's useful to note is that creativity is not common. I mean, everyone

1389
02:08:50,640 --> 02:08:57,440
isn't creative. That's wrong. Some people are very creative. A minority of people are very creative.

1390
02:08:57,440 --> 02:09:02,960
And I mean, it's a continuum, but you don't get, you know, you don't get creativity till you get

1391
02:09:02,960 --> 02:09:07,920
out to the point where what you're doing is original. And that's very difficult. So it's a minority

1392
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:12,880
proposition. And then of those original people, there's only a tiny fraction that can make a

1393
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:17,680
successful financial go of it because it's just you have to be creative. Plus, you have to have

1394
02:09:17,680 --> 02:09:22,720
some sense for marketing and sales and business. And you have to be reasonably emotionally stable

1395
02:09:22,720 --> 02:09:30,640
and etc. etc. It's very, very difficult. But if you are creative by temperament, well, that's you.

1396
02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:37,760
To not do that is to not be you. It's like asking an extroverted person not to be around people

1397
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:43,120
or an agreeable person not to engage in intimate relationships or a conscientious person not to

1398
02:09:43,120 --> 02:09:48,320
be driven by duty. It's like, that's what you're like. And so yeah, you're stuck with it. It's a

1399
02:09:48,320 --> 02:09:55,280
double edged sword creativity. It's vital. It's entrancing. It's necessary. It's transformative.

1400
02:09:55,280 --> 02:10:02,560
It's disruptive. But it's a high risk, high risk, high return game. And the probability of failure is

1401
02:10:03,280 --> 02:10:08,640
overwhelmingly high. Even if you're an entrepreneur and you know, more practically oriented in your

1402
02:10:08,640 --> 02:10:13,520
creativity, the probability that you'll make money from your innovation or your invention

1403
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:19,280
rather than other people is very, very low. But you need to find a way. I mean, it's also very

1404
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:23,360
difficult if you're a creative person to a lot of creative people don't think in practical terms.

1405
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:27,840
They don't think in terms of money. Actually, they're hopeless. A lot of them might I know are

1406
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:32,240
hopeless. They also tend to be casually contemptuous of that to regard as practical

1407
02:10:32,240 --> 02:10:37,040
concerns is selling out. It's like, you should be bloody happy if you have the opportunity to sell

1408
02:10:37,040 --> 02:10:42,960
out. So I think that the ideal is to find a way to pursue your vocation, but have one eye on the

1409
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:50,320
reality that you will have to earn money somewhere or another. I mean, yes, I think it's, that's why

1410
02:10:50,320 --> 02:10:54,560
I think I'm lucky. And so far as with Titania, I hit on something that had commercial viability,

1411
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:59,280
but it was very true to what I desperately wanted to do. And I think that's so rare. I think some

1412
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:02,480
of the stuff I've written, some of the plays I've written, for instance, I don't think would have

1413
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:07,280
any commercial success whatsoever. But I wrote them because I needed to write them. And some of

1414
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:12,000
them didn't even get on. And maybe one day they will. And that would be great. But what you have

1415
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:19,600
to accomplish though, right? You have to have your creative endeavor aligned with market demand at

1416
02:11:19,600 --> 02:11:25,840
exactly that time. It's impossible. It's very, very unlikely. Actually, that's why I always say,

1417
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:31,440
don't attempt to anticipate the zeitgeist because you won't. Like the best thing an artist can do

1418
02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:37,120
is do what they believe and hope because a lot of it is luck. You know what I mean?

1419
02:11:37,120 --> 02:11:41,040
I mean, there's actually, there's a technical literature on that too. I mean, what essentially

1420
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:45,840
what you do is continue to produce ideas. And it's a Darwinian competition. Essentially,

1421
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:51,120
they're like life forms, these ideas. And now and then one will find a niche that it can thrive in.

1422
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:58,400
But the best way to maximize your chance is that that niche will manifest itself is to be,

1423
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:05,680
is to overproduce. Because look, for I'll give you an example, I answered a bunch of questions on

1424
02:12:05,680 --> 02:12:11,200
Quora. So that's a website where anybody can ask any questions and anybody can answer. I answered

1425
02:12:11,200 --> 02:12:16,560
about 50 when I was playing with Quora. And one of them was a list of everything people should know,

1426
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:20,000
of things people should know in their life. And I derived my books out of that list.

1427
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:27,200
It was disproportionately successful. Most of the answers I generated got virtually no views,

1428
02:12:27,200 --> 02:12:31,440
but it got, it must be hundreds of thousands now. But even before I wrote the books, it was tens of

1429
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:39,360
thousands. But had I not written 50, I wouldn't have got that one. The other 49 failures, so to

1430
02:12:39,360 --> 02:12:46,400
speak, were the answers weren't necessarily worse. They just didn't hit the zeitgeist,

1431
02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:52,000
like that answer did. And I think that's a great piece of advice. Overproduction, because

1432
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:56,400
it's the same with the Beatles. They look like an overnight success. It's because they've been

1433
02:12:56,400 --> 02:13:04,160
playing endlessly in those dingy clubs in Europe. Before it happened, you produce as much as you

1434
02:13:04,160 --> 02:13:10,000
can. They say it takes 10 years to become an overnight success. That's it. Most of the things

1435
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:15,840
I've written have done nothing and gone nowhere and had no success whatsoever. But the one thing,

1436
02:13:15,840 --> 02:13:20,560
occasionally when it hits, that's what sustains all the rest of it. And it's also why creativity

1437
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:25,440
continues to be selected, let's say, from a biological perspective. It's like, that's why

1438
02:13:25,440 --> 02:13:30,560
I said it was a high risk, high return game. Almost everything you do creatively will fail.

1439
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:37,200
But now and then, you're disproportionately successful. And so that keeps the whole game going.

1440
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:41,440
You didn't have any sense, did you, that when you put the lectures on YouTube that it would

1441
02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:49,360
explode in this way? I mean, not in this way. That was completely, I'm still shocked constantly

1442
02:13:49,360 --> 02:13:55,360
by my life. I'm shocked out of sanity by my life. I just can't. This is why I asked you

1443
02:13:55,360 --> 02:14:01,840
about Titania. You get at the center of a whirlwind like that. And there's something very

1444
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:09,280
surreal about it. And I keep getting hit by surreal things. And it's very hard to wrap

1445
02:14:09,280 --> 02:14:17,120
my head around it. Like this Red Skull episode was just one of many equally surreal occurrences.

1446
02:14:17,120 --> 02:14:26,160
But no, I had no idea. I knew I was working on something important back when I was in my 20s,

1447
02:14:26,160 --> 02:14:31,120
when I wrote my first book. And it was out of that, that all my lectures came. I spent 15 years

1448
02:14:31,120 --> 02:14:36,480
working on that book. And I worked on it about three hours a day. And so I thought about it

1449
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:42,880
all the time. And so I knew there was something to it, not necessarily because they were my ideas,

1450
02:14:42,880 --> 02:14:48,160
but because of the people who I had read and delved into while I was writing the book. I knew

1451
02:14:48,160 --> 02:14:54,480
the ideas were significant. And I could see the effect of the ideas when I was lecturing on my

1452
02:14:54,480 --> 02:15:01,520
students. So I had some sense that there was something vital, that I was involved in something

1453
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:06,800
vital. But sure. But had you uploaded those videos a couple of years before or a couple of years

1454
02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:10,560
later, you probably would have missed the zeitgeist and nothing would have happened. I mean, it

1455
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:14,560
doesn't matter. I always think with any kind of creative endeavor or intellectual endeavor, it

1456
02:15:14,560 --> 02:15:19,360
doesn't matter how good you are in a sense, it has to be good. And the timing has to be right.

1457
02:15:19,360 --> 02:15:23,440
And like you say, if you just keep, I think persistence is it, if you just keep doing it,

1458
02:15:23,440 --> 02:15:29,520
not only does your craft get better and you are, if it does hit, you're in a position to be able to

1459
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:35,520
no doubt. Look, if you, if you, okay, so in scientific literature, the hallmark of impact

1460
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:41,040
is citations. And so if your work is cited, it means that someone who's written another scientific

1461
02:15:41,040 --> 02:15:47,760
article makes reference to something you wrote. And that's all tracked and it's used for promotions

1462
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:54,160
and it's used to judge scientific merit. It's, it's, it's its own science citation tracking.

1463
02:15:54,400 --> 02:16:02,560
A very small number of your published papers accrue most of the citations. So that's the first

1464
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:07,280
thing. So what that means is the more papers you publish, the more likely it is that one of them

1465
02:16:07,280 --> 02:16:12,720
will become highly cited. And my highly cited papers aren't necessarily the ones that I thought

1466
02:16:12,720 --> 02:16:21,920
would be most impactful. So you, but the other piece of information from literature on creativity

1467
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:28,160
is that the best predictor of quality, and so you could index quality by impact, let's say,

1468
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:34,000
or by citations is quantity. Yeah, it's not a great predictor, but it's the best one. And so

1469
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:38,880
this is a good advice for everyone out there who's a musician or an artist. It's like,

1470
02:16:39,760 --> 02:16:44,000
produce, produce, produce, produce as much as you can, because you do get better at it, right?

1471
02:16:44,960 --> 02:16:50,080
You absolutely do. And, and so there's that, but there's also, I think the other important thing

1472
02:16:50,080 --> 02:16:55,840
is to, to actually be true to yourself in your artistic endeavors, insofar as don't be trying

1473
02:16:55,840 --> 02:16:59,920
to anticipate the desire, guys, don't be trying to anticipate what other people are doing. My big

1474
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:05,040
concern in the current climate that we live in is that a lot of artists are choosing to self-censor,

1475
02:17:05,040 --> 02:17:11,600
because the penalty for risk taking has got too high. You know, you can be completely, I mean,

1476
02:17:11,600 --> 02:17:15,360
if I think of an example like- Well, think about what kind of catastrophe that is, because we've

1477
02:17:15,360 --> 02:17:20,800
already discussed the fact that the impediments to creativity are almost insurmountable. And so

1478
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:25,440
then you add an additional one, which is self-censorship because of social pressure. It's like,

1479
02:17:25,440 --> 02:17:30,000
you just decimate the creative enterprise by doing that. We wouldn't have anything. We, we,

1480
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:33,680
the western canon would be decimated. It's ridiculous. I mean, an example I often think of

1481
02:17:33,680 --> 02:17:38,000
is, is one of my favorite playwrights is Edward Albee. And when he came to write his play, The

1482
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:41,600
Goat, which was a very controversial play, because it was about a man having an affair,

1483
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:45,680
a sexual affair with a goat behind his wife's back. And obviously that doesn't sound palatable.

1484
02:17:45,680 --> 02:17:50,720
Well, at least he went behind his wife's back. Exactly. At least it wasn't sort of an open,

1485
02:17:50,720 --> 02:17:55,920
sort of paganistic thing, absolutely. But I mean, it's, it's a shocking play and it's meant to be.

1486
02:17:55,920 --> 02:18:03,680
It's about where our lines of tolerance are, where they lie and why. And all of his friends told him,

1487
02:18:03,680 --> 02:18:07,840
don't do this. You've got a valuable career, an incredible reputation. You're turning 80. You're

1488
02:18:08,080 --> 02:18:11,120
80. He was roughly 80 years old when this play came out. And they said, you're just going to

1489
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:16,480
scupper everything. And he said that when he got that response, that's the reason he did it.

1490
02:18:16,480 --> 02:18:20,560
He went out there and he put the play on. And it turned out to be a huge success. It won,

1491
02:18:20,560 --> 02:18:24,400
I think, the Tony Award for best play. It was critically and commercially successful. It was

1492
02:18:24,400 --> 02:18:30,160
absolutely massive. So it just goes to show, I think, to an extent, I mean, I'm not saying disregard

1493
02:18:30,720 --> 02:18:35,040
feedback from other creative people or people who have suggestion. What I am saying is if you're

1494
02:18:35,040 --> 02:18:41,280
true to your muse, whatever that that is, the rewards will come, actually, or they are more

1495
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:46,720
likely to come. Okay, so that brings us back to free speech too, because, you know, the problem

1496
02:18:46,720 --> 02:18:51,520
with laws that abridge free speech is they abridge creative endeavor. And that's a terrible thing,

1497
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:57,760
because it's the source of endless renewal. And it's the thing that fixes corrupt structures. And

1498
02:18:57,760 --> 02:19:04,240
so to, to take aim at that is to take aim at the very process that would rescue you from the conundrum

1499
02:19:05,120 --> 02:19:11,680
you are pretending to be obsessed by. I mean, has there been any innovation, not just in artistic

1500
02:19:11,680 --> 02:19:16,400
terms, but in scientific terms, without the risk of offense without, you know, I mentioned the

1501
02:19:16,400 --> 02:19:21,840
example of Galileo in the book, because, you know, he wasn't, he caused a great deal of offense.

1502
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:28,640
Oh hell, Darwin offended himself so badly that he was sick. He was sick for like a decade because

1503
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:33,440
of the implications of what he'd thought up, which were thoroughly offensive to himself.

1504
02:19:34,320 --> 02:19:39,360
As they would be, you know, in with his belief system at the time. And, but, but that's, that's

1505
02:19:39,360 --> 02:19:46,400
the, we can see in hindsight, what we would have lost if people weren't willing to risk offending

1506
02:19:46,400 --> 02:19:49,680
others. In fact, even what you said to Kathy Newman in that interview about your risking

1507
02:19:49,680 --> 02:19:54,000
being offensive by disagreeing with me now in this way, like, it's how it's important to risk

1508
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:59,920
offending people. It's because otherwise you just end up in this kind of, you know, this hive mind

1509
02:19:59,920 --> 02:20:06,880
and, and, and for the arts, it becomes utterly stultified. It becomes so boring when, when

1510
02:20:06,880 --> 02:20:12,320
everything is predictable and everything is in line with a viewpoint and no one wants to, you

1511
02:20:12,320 --> 02:20:16,640
know, the art is the best way that we interrogate the complexities of humanity. It's, it's, it's,

1512
02:20:17,680 --> 02:20:22,560
I love what sometimes what the filmmaker Lars von Trier, he said in an interview once that

1513
02:20:22,560 --> 02:20:26,480
sometimes when he's making a film, he will take an indefensible moral position

1514
02:20:26,480 --> 02:20:30,320
and attempt to defend it through the film, which I think is such a fascinating idea.

1515
02:20:30,320 --> 02:20:34,080
Dostoevsky did that all the time in his great novels and so brilliant. I mean,

1516
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:40,880
that's what, what made Dostoevsky so staggeringly brilliant was he would take positions that he,

1517
02:20:41,680 --> 02:20:48,080
that he despised with all his soul and make the people putting those beliefs forward that

1518
02:20:48,080 --> 02:20:51,360
strongest characters in the book. I mean, he's so brave.

1519
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:55,760
It's the best thing to do. It's, it's, I wrote a play once where I completely,

1520
02:20:55,760 --> 02:21:01,360
it was a one man play where I completely tried to embody the kind of person I despise. It was

1521
02:21:01,360 --> 02:21:07,920
someone who enjoyed relished watching via acts of violence and he would take a scour the internet

1522
02:21:07,920 --> 02:21:12,080
for clips of real life violence. And it's something I can, you know, whenever I've had that, whenever

1523
02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:16,320
someone's tried to show me a beheading or something, I know I never want to see that kind of thing.

1524
02:21:16,320 --> 02:21:19,600
I know I never want that in my head. And so I wanted to write a character

1525
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:24,640
who relished it. But from a position, from a non-judgmental position, I've never put that

1526
02:21:24,640 --> 02:21:29,520
play on. I've written it's done. But the act of doing it was so incredibly liberating and

1527
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:34,160
interesting. And the idea that you can, you know, you keep hearing this all the time,

1528
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:40,640
you know, whenever a new film or a play comes out of a book, is this sending the right message?

1529
02:21:40,640 --> 02:21:45,440
David Lynch's last series, the latest Twin Peaks series was criticized, I read a review saying,

1530
02:21:45,440 --> 02:21:49,680
well, there's violence against women in this, and he needs to be called out for this. Well,

1531
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:53,840
representing violence against women isn't an endorsement of violence against women.

1532
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:56,800
You know, maybe that's what the character does, and maybe we're supposed to hate him for it or

1533
02:21:56,800 --> 02:22:01,600
whatever, you know, and or if you read an autobiography of a complete reprobate,

1534
02:22:01,600 --> 02:22:05,600
there can be something really interesting about that. And imagine all of this gone,

1535
02:22:05,600 --> 02:22:11,040
all of this potential. But that is the end point of that's why I believe that this this current

1536
