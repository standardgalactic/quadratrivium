Hello. If you have found the ideas I discuss interesting and useful, perhaps you might

00:07.040 --> 00:14.480
consider purchasing my recently released book, Beyond Order. 12 more rules for life, available

00:14.480 --> 00:20.960
from Penguin Random House, in print, or audio format. You could use the links we provide

00:20.960 --> 00:28.720
below or buy through Amazon or at your local bookstore. This new book, Beyond Order, provides

00:28.720 --> 00:34.400
what I hope is a productive and interesting walk through ideas that are both philosophically and

00:34.400 --> 00:41.440
sometimes spiritually meaningful, as well as being immediately implementable and practical.

00:42.960 --> 00:48.080
Beyond Order can be read and understood on its own, but also builds on the concepts that I

00:48.080 --> 00:54.720
developed in my previous books, 12 rules for life, and before that, maps of meaning.

00:55.440 --> 01:09.440
Thanks for listening and enjoy the podcast.

01:09.440 --> 01:29.040
I'm pleased today to be talking to Dr. Ian McGillchrist. I met him in 2018 in London, and

01:29.040 --> 01:35.840
we had the good fortune to have a relatively brief conversation, which was taped and put on

01:35.840 --> 01:41.840
YouTube, and it was very productive. And so now I get to talk to him again, and hopefully for a

01:41.840 --> 01:49.120
longer period of time. Ian is a psychiatrist. Dr. McGillchrist is a psychologist, a psychiatrist,

01:49.120 --> 01:54.480
a former fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, an associate fellow of Green Templeton College,

01:54.480 --> 01:59.200
Oxford. He's lectured all over the world. He's published a number of scientific papers.

01:59.200 --> 02:05.040
He's most well known for his book, The Master and His Emissary, and I think you have a copy of that.

02:05.040 --> 02:10.720
I asked you to get that so that you could show people. The Master and His Emissary,

02:11.600 --> 02:16.640
the divided brain in the making of the Western world, which is an analysis of hemispheric

02:16.640 --> 02:24.880
specialization and its philosophical and scientific significance. And he's working on a new book,

02:24.880 --> 02:30.000
which I have and have started to read a long ways into it at the moment, called The Matter of Things,

02:30.720 --> 02:35.440
which will be forthcoming at some point in the future, and we'll shape some of our discussion

02:35.440 --> 02:43.440
today. He's published broadly, scientifically and publicly, a study of paintings on

02:43.440 --> 02:48.800
of subjects with psychotic illnesses that's coming out, I believe. I'm planning that.

02:50.080 --> 02:54.080
And a series and also forthcoming a series of essays about culture and the brain.

02:54.880 --> 02:58.320
So welcome. Thank you very much for agreeing to talk to me.

02:59.520 --> 03:01.920
That was a huge pleasure, Jordan. Thank you very much.

03:03.040 --> 03:10.800
So one of the things I was rereading the introduction to your new book this morning,

03:10.800 --> 03:17.600
and I was struck by many different topics, but I was particularly interested in your

03:17.600 --> 03:27.040
conception of attention. And so you talk about attention as something that in some sense brings

03:27.040 --> 03:33.920
things into being. I don't think that's a misreading of your writing. And maybe I could

03:33.920 --> 03:38.080
get you to expound on that a bit and to tell me what you think attention is, because I've had a

03:38.080 --> 03:43.280
hell of a time differentiating it from, well, from fluid intelligence, for example, or from

03:43.280 --> 03:48.640
consciousness. It's a word that makes sense when you hear it in the context of a bunch of other

03:48.640 --> 03:54.000
words, but when you extract it out from that context and try to grip it, it falls apart in

03:54.000 --> 04:02.880
your grasp. So I think one could say that attention is the way in which the individual disposes

04:03.600 --> 04:11.600
his or her attention. It's a disposition of one's consciousness. So attention is how you

04:11.600 --> 04:17.680
dispose your consciousness towards the world. And when I discovered, when I was researching

04:18.560 --> 04:21.680
the master and his emissary, the book that's now 10 years old,

04:23.680 --> 04:30.560
I came across this fascinating thing that one of the most fundamental differences

04:30.560 --> 04:36.720
between the hemispheres is their way of attending. And it didn't entirely hit me at the time how

04:36.720 --> 04:42.640
important it is. But we can talk about that later. But you were asking the rather sort of

04:42.640 --> 04:47.920
interesting philosophical question about how attention helps to bring things into being.

04:48.720 --> 04:56.320
And I think it does both generally and rather in a very particular sense in the left hemisphere.

04:57.520 --> 05:02.640
Generally, what I mean is that how you attend to the world depends,

05:02.720 --> 05:08.880
you know, on that depends what world you find. The qualities of the world that comes to your

05:08.880 --> 05:15.600
attention is determined by the quality of the attention you bring to it. And

05:16.720 --> 05:23.600
that's a very significant statement. I was talking to someone the other day who's somewhat

05:23.600 --> 05:30.800
theologically minded. And he was also very interested in the role that attention played on

05:31.120 --> 05:37.520
in constituting the world. I mean, you pay attention to things that you value one way or

05:37.520 --> 05:44.080
another. And what that means is that the world tends to manifest itself in relationship to

05:44.080 --> 05:51.760
your value structure. And that that's a very troublesome idea, in some sense, with regards

05:51.760 --> 05:58.000
to our conceptions of the objective world, because it's not easy to it's not easy to parse out what's

05:58.080 --> 06:04.400
objective, when what manifests itself to you is dependent in large part on what you value.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.960
It's very complicated to sort that all out.

06:08.240 --> 06:15.600
Well, possibly very much later, we can come to the question of what objective and subjective

06:15.600 --> 06:24.240
mean and how one can, I think it's a mistaken dichotomy. I think one can interpret the words

06:24.320 --> 06:29.360
interpret the words in important ways that give them meaning. But I think to think of the just

06:29.360 --> 06:35.520
being an objective world out there and a subjective world in here is one of the problems with

06:35.520 --> 06:41.520
modern Western philosophy. But to come back to the creation of the world, I was going to say that

06:41.520 --> 06:46.640
not only does it sort of bring into the world the world that you know, which is after all by

06:46.640 --> 06:52.640
definition the only world you will ever know. But it also changes who you are. So the quality of

06:52.640 --> 07:02.000
the attention you pay changes you, the attender. So it's a very profound difference. And in the

07:02.000 --> 07:09.920
first book, the master and his emissary, one of the things I was expounding was how this business

07:09.920 --> 07:20.160
of attention creates a whole distinct world. So the hemispheres have evolved to two different

07:20.160 --> 07:25.120
sets of values. You mentioned values, and it's very germane. They have different

07:26.960 --> 07:30.800
reasons for existing and therefore have different things they respond to.

07:32.960 --> 07:43.280
And what I have tried to explain in that book is that this gives rise to a whole way

07:43.920 --> 07:47.680
of seeing the world in a whole world, which is not just for the individual, but also

07:48.640 --> 07:53.840
at times it becomes the way of looking at the world for a whole culture. Because of course,

07:53.840 --> 07:59.120
as individuals, never entirely distinct from our culture. We're partly created by our culture and

07:59.120 --> 08:06.720
make it what it is. So it's a very fundamental thing. Well, you take pains in the master and his

08:06.720 --> 08:15.280
emissary to promote the idea or to call attention to the idea that something extremely mysterious

08:15.280 --> 08:22.320
is going on in relationship to hemispheric specialization. So it's a very ancient phenomenon.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.600
Many creatures or most creatures with developed nervous systems have a bifurcated brain.

08:30.400 --> 08:36.960
And the hemispheres differ substantially in terms of their neuroanatomical structure.

08:36.960 --> 08:43.760
And the question arises, why is it necessary, assuming that that differentiation of structure

08:43.760 --> 08:48.960
reflects some profound differentiation of function, why is it necessary to look at the world,

08:48.960 --> 08:56.240
so to speak, in two ways? And why is it so necessary that that bifurcation is conserved

08:56.240 --> 09:02.640
across evolutionary history? You'd think that one way would be sufficient, but it doesn't seem to be.

09:02.640 --> 09:06.480
And so the first question is, why do you have to look at the world in two ways?

09:07.040 --> 09:12.960
And the next question might be, well, what are those two ways? One of the things you outlined

09:12.960 --> 09:18.800
that's particularly fascinating to me is that the right hemisphere seems to be specialized

09:18.800 --> 09:24.880
more for what you don't know, whereas the left hemisphere is specialized more for what you do

09:24.880 --> 09:33.920
know. And I've sort of defined knowing pragmatically, you know something if you undertake an action and

09:33.920 --> 09:38.720
the outcome is what you specified. And you don't know something if you undertake an action and

09:38.720 --> 09:44.720
the outcome is other than what you specified. And that sort of reflects that novelty visualization

09:46.720 --> 09:52.960
division that was Goldberg, I believe, that originated that, that the neuropsychologist.

09:55.120 --> 09:59.760
Well, Jordan, you've raised a whole bunch of points there. So I need a little bit of time to

10:00.160 --> 10:08.800
to explain that. First of all, every neural network that we know of is asymmetrical,

10:09.600 --> 10:14.160
going down to the very most basic network that we know, and the most ancient one that we know.

10:15.200 --> 10:22.400
Nemetostellavictensis, a CNM and E that is 700 million years old is already asymmetrical in its

10:22.400 --> 10:26.800
neural network. And that's the earliest neural network we know of. And it's true of insects,

10:26.800 --> 10:32.560
it's true of worms, it's true of, you know, all the way up to human beings. And the three questions

10:32.560 --> 10:41.120
that really got me going on this was if the brain is there for making connections and its power is

10:41.120 --> 10:47.040
largely lies in the question, the connections it can make, why is it divided down the middle,

10:48.240 --> 10:53.280
whoppingly divided? I mean, most people don't realize quite how big this this differentiation

10:53.280 --> 10:59.360
is and if they haven't actually seen a brain. The second thing is why is it asymmetrical?

10:59.360 --> 11:03.520
Because if you just need to grow this brain, you'd grow it symmetrically, the skull that

11:03.520 --> 11:09.040
contains it is symmetrical. And the third thing is why is the connection, the principal connection

11:09.040 --> 11:14.640
between the two hemispheres at the base of the hemispheres, the corpus callosum, why is it at

11:14.640 --> 11:22.000
least as much if not more in the service of inhibition than facilitation? So it's as though

11:22.000 --> 11:29.360
there's something really important about keeping two things apart. Now, my hypothesis,

11:30.080 --> 11:36.400
and it's just that, is that this results from something that all creatures need to do.

11:37.600 --> 11:44.880
All creatures without exception need to eat and not be eaten. They need to live and to manipulate

11:44.880 --> 11:49.040
their environment, to get food, to catch something, to pick something up quickly,

11:49.040 --> 11:54.160
deftly, to pick up a twig, to build a nest. In other words, for all the kind of day to day stuff,

11:54.160 --> 12:00.640
food, shelter, they need to be able to manipulate the world very precisely. But at the same time,

12:00.640 --> 12:07.040
they must pay a precisely opposite kind of attention, which is sustained, vigilant, open

12:07.040 --> 12:14.800
without presupposition to as to what it may find. And so on the whole, the way in which this has

12:14.800 --> 12:22.240
been addressed by evolution is that there are two neuronal masses that can direct attention at the

12:22.240 --> 12:29.040
world. And the left hemisphere tends to specialize in targeted precise attention, and the right hemisphere

12:29.040 --> 12:33.680
in a much broader, vigilant kind of attention, which actually sustains the being of the world.

12:34.240 --> 12:39.040
Nothing about these tiny fragments that are isolated, disconnected, meaningless

12:40.000 --> 12:45.440
gives you any idea of their meaning. It's only when you see the broad picture, and you understand

12:45.440 --> 12:49.360
that they're not actually things that go to be put together to make that broad picture,

12:49.360 --> 12:55.760
but are things that are isolated out of an already connected picture. So that's the

12:55.760 --> 13:01.280
basis of that. I just wanted to pick up your thing about, because I don't think it's quite right to

13:01.280 --> 13:06.000
say that the left hemisphere is about what you know, and the right's about what you don't know.

13:06.000 --> 13:15.520
Somebody, I can't remember who, some philosopher said, that knowledge is what we're uncertain of.

13:16.720 --> 13:20.320
The things we're certain of are things that we don't really know properly. I think there's a

13:20.320 --> 13:26.560
good deal of truth in that. The left hemisphere tends to jump to conclusions. It's much more

13:26.560 --> 13:30.800
quick and dirty than the right hemisphere. The right hemisphere is the one that says,

13:30.800 --> 13:35.600
hang on, wait a moment, you may be getting this wrong, because it wants to get things quickly.

13:36.080 --> 13:41.200
Its job is to manipulate. Its job is to get. It's to catch. It's to grab stuff. It's the

13:41.200 --> 13:47.040
one that controls the right hand that does all the grabbing. So the left hemisphere tends to

13:47.040 --> 13:53.040
price certainty, and it's very uncomfortable when there's ambivalence. Whereas the right

13:53.040 --> 13:54.240
hemisphere- Well, what is that ambivalence you can't act?

13:55.920 --> 14:01.760
Exactly. Whereas the right hemisphere seems to appreciate the possibility that we have to hold

14:01.840 --> 14:09.920
multiple views, multiple possibilities together. And so it has a quite different

14:10.800 --> 14:18.480
take on reality. It's more interested in discovery and exploration rather than capture.

14:18.480 --> 14:21.760
The left hemisphere is more interested in capturing a thing that it thinks it knows, often,

14:22.400 --> 14:28.080
you know, not in any deep way. It's just identified an object it needs. But to understand things,

14:28.080 --> 14:31.920
the right hemisphere is better. And the idea of the master and the emissary is,

14:31.920 --> 14:38.640
I won't go through the myth of it. I've explained it so many times, but the basic idea is that the

14:38.640 --> 14:43.280
master, the right hemisphere, knows that it needs an emissary to do the sort of functional

14:43.280 --> 14:49.200
administration work. So it's aware that the stuff that it mustn't get involved with and that it

14:49.200 --> 14:56.000
can't know. Whereas the left hemisphere knows everything as it were in its eyes, because

14:56.000 --> 15:01.760
it only knows a tiny bit, which is explicit. And, you know, there it is in broad daylight,

15:01.760 --> 15:08.880
down in black and white, no shades of meaning, no nuances, nothing implicit about it.

15:08.880 --> 15:14.480
So it thinks it knows it. And if you like the downfall of the left hemisphere, and therefore,

15:15.200 --> 15:22.640
I would go with the society, the civilization, as it once was that we belong to, is that the

15:22.640 --> 15:28.640
left hemisphere doesn't know what it is it doesn't know. It's, you know, it's, you know,

15:28.640 --> 15:33.120
the famous thing they're done in Kruger effect. The more you know, the more you think you don't

15:33.120 --> 15:38.160
know. And the people who know least think they know everything. It's a little, that's not quite

15:38.160 --> 15:43.600
fair, but there's something of that about it. Yeah. But can I pick up something that I touched on

15:43.600 --> 15:49.680
earlier? We're talking about creating the world through attention. And I think that is, that is

15:49.680 --> 15:56.480
true. And there's a very big question there about what I mean by that. Do I mean just as you say

15:56.480 --> 16:03.600
subjectively or objectively? And maybe we should part that for the moment. But I don't mean either

16:03.600 --> 16:09.600
in a very simple way. But what is fascinating is that the right hemisphere, as I say, knows that

16:09.600 --> 16:15.840
there are things that it's not aware of. But the left hemisphere seems to take the attitude

16:15.840 --> 16:22.800
that if it's not attending to it, it doesn't exist. This is very dramatic in clinical neurology.

16:22.800 --> 16:30.720
So people who've had a right hemisphere stroke, they not only, as it were, don't now pay attention

16:30.720 --> 16:36.880
to something, but they deny that that thing ever existed. There's a wonderful, you know,

16:38.160 --> 16:44.080
very rich accounts of patients. One of the ones that I really like is an experiment done by,

16:44.560 --> 16:50.880
who was it, Biziak and Lutsati, I think, back in the late 1970s, where they got a couple of highly

16:50.880 --> 16:57.120
educated people with right hemisphere strokes. And they were in Milan at the time. And they said,

16:57.120 --> 17:02.080
you know, these people lived in Milan. And they said, imagine you're standing in the Piazza del Duomo

17:02.080 --> 17:10.320
in front of the cathedral and looking at the square. Describe all the buildings in the square.

17:10.320 --> 17:15.040
And they would describe only the ones on the right side that the left hemisphere only pays attention

17:15.040 --> 17:19.680
to. Whereas you know, but I need to say for the viewers that the right hemisphere pays attention

17:19.680 --> 17:25.680
to both halves of the world. So when you have a left hemisphere stroke, the world is relatively

17:25.680 --> 17:30.880
preserved globally. But after a right hemisphere stroke, you're only relying on this left hemisphere

17:30.880 --> 17:35.120
who's interested in the bit of space which it can manipulate, the bit on the right. So they named

17:35.680 --> 17:39.920
the buildings down the right hand side of the view of the square they had then.

17:40.800 --> 17:44.240
And then the experimenters had asked them to go to the other end of the square and look at the

17:44.240 --> 17:50.400
cathedral facade and name the buildings. And this time they named all the ones down the other side

17:50.400 --> 17:56.080
of the square, but didn't mention any of the ones they just mentioned. So there's something,

17:57.120 --> 18:01.680
it's been commented by one philosopher that it's almost like there's an ontological landslide.

18:01.680 --> 18:07.440
Things come in and out of existence for the left hemisphere. And when it was pointed out to these

18:07.440 --> 18:12.560
people what they'd missed, they became angry, irritable and frustrated, which is a typical

18:13.600 --> 18:23.120
left hemisphere emotional town, impatient to dismiss this. So I think that's intriguing. I mean,

18:23.120 --> 18:27.920
it's just one image. I mean, the very dramatic one is to do with denying that you have parts of the

18:27.920 --> 18:35.920
body. And as was pointed out by Pritz Langler, I think way back in the second decade of the 20th

18:35.920 --> 18:42.000
century, they don't only deny after a right hemisphere stroke that they have the left

18:42.000 --> 18:46.080
half of the body, which is not functioning because of the right hemisphere stroke,

18:47.360 --> 18:52.400
they will become very irritable if questions are asked about it or they will just go blank.

18:52.400 --> 18:55.760
I mean, they will be talking perfectly coherently and then they're asked about that and they will

18:55.760 --> 19:02.480
go stum, or they will become very irritated. And if you force them to recognize that they have a

19:02.480 --> 19:05.920
body on that side, although they're perfectly intelligent people, they know they must always

19:05.920 --> 19:10.480
have had a left half of their body, they will deny it. And he says it's as though they never had a

19:10.480 --> 19:15.040
left half of the body. It's not only that it's not there now, it never was for them and never will

19:15.040 --> 19:21.680
be. Now that's what I mean when I say that there are different levels of creativity of the world

19:21.680 --> 19:27.440
or the creation of the world through attention, I should say, in the two hemispheres.

19:28.080 --> 19:34.000
Now you're in your new book, and to some degree in the master and his emissary, you're also making,

19:35.200 --> 19:40.480
you're mixing your neurological analysis with philosophical speculation and you're trying to

19:40.480 --> 19:47.920
solve a problem. So maybe you could tell us what the problem is and then we can discuss the solution.

19:48.080 --> 19:56.400
Well, I suppose the problem is the one that I mentioned, that there is a puzzle about why

19:58.720 --> 20:04.480
brains are set up in this rather odd way. But you're also pointing to a kind of philosophical

20:04.480 --> 20:12.320
malaise, right? So there's a conceptual problem, but also an emotional or broad-scale philosophical

20:12.320 --> 20:18.720
problem. And there is, there is indeed. And indeed, if I may say so, the book that I hope will come

20:18.720 --> 20:25.040
out fairly soon called The Matter with Things, which is a pun on several levels, because I think

20:25.040 --> 20:31.520
it's a critique not only of the way we think now, but of our obsession with thinking of the world

20:31.520 --> 20:37.680
as composed of things and that only matter exists. But anyway, in that book, what I'm really trying

20:37.680 --> 20:42.720
to do is marry science and philosophy again. They never should have been separated. Science

20:43.600 --> 20:48.800
cannot properly be done by philosophy without philosophy. Many scientists and philosophers

20:48.800 --> 20:53.280
have commented on this over the years, and the divorce has been disastrous for them both.

20:53.280 --> 20:58.320
You get a mindless kind of science that jumps to very naive conclusions that everything is

20:58.320 --> 21:05.600
mechanical. And you get a kind of philosophy that thinks it's above dirtying its hands with science.

21:05.600 --> 21:14.480
Now, I think each of these parties can benefit from a rapprochement, which is long overdue.

21:14.480 --> 21:20.880
And it's that that I try to do in this very big book to show how strands of neurology, philosophy,

21:20.880 --> 21:28.960
and physics, and even of world mythologies come together to show the same very similar pictures,

21:28.960 --> 21:36.400
the same Gestalten, the same differences between a world such as the world brought into being by

21:36.400 --> 21:40.400
the left hemisphere and a world such as is brought into being by the right hemisphere.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.760
And perhaps if we're going on any further, you did invite me earlier to say something about

21:43.760 --> 21:49.360
what those differences are. Well, to try and sum it up very quickly, what I'd say is for the left

21:49.360 --> 21:59.520
hemisphere, things are known, familiar, literally things that are unfamiliar are better dealt with

21:59.520 --> 22:03.600
by the right hemisphere until the left hemisphere can go, oh, I see, it's one of those and put it

22:03.600 --> 22:10.000
in the category box. They're more distinct. In fact, they're probably entirely fragmentary or

22:10.000 --> 22:15.440
isolated in the left hemisphere, whereas there the right hemisphere sees that nothing is ever

22:15.440 --> 22:23.120
ultimately unconnected from everything else. Things in the left hemisphere are frozen.

22:23.120 --> 22:28.480
They don't move. They don't change. Things in the right hemisphere are constantly flowing and changing,

22:29.120 --> 22:34.960
although flowing and changing and remaining the same are not necessarily

22:35.040 --> 22:45.360
an opposition. As we know, Heraclitus, my favorite philosopher, said, by changing, it remains the

22:45.360 --> 22:49.440
same, which is the image of a river which is never, ever still for a moment, but the river

22:50.160 --> 22:56.240
outside my house that was there at breakfast time is probably there now. So in that sense,

22:56.240 --> 23:01.760
it's remained. And we're all, I believe, like these rivers are all living beings are. In fact,

23:01.760 --> 23:07.120
probably everything that exists is as Heraclitus pointed out. So what are the things? The left

23:07.120 --> 23:13.680
hemisphere abstracts. It tends to abstract from the body. It tends to abstract from the context.

23:14.320 --> 23:20.080
And something I learned very early on in life was the importance of context, how it utterly changes

23:20.640 --> 23:26.320
anything that somebody says or any image. And this is particularly true, of course, of literature,

23:26.320 --> 23:31.920
which I studied and taught for a certain while when I was a young man,

23:32.720 --> 23:37.040
that once you start paraphrasing a poem and taking its sentiments out of the context,

23:37.040 --> 23:42.960
they've utterly changed themselves and no longer what they were. And the left hemisphere is more

23:42.960 --> 23:48.480
interested in categories, the right hemisphere in the unique case. So it sees that you're not just

23:49.040 --> 23:53.360
a member of a certain group, you take certain boxes, you fall into that category,

23:53.440 --> 23:59.120
but that you're massively complicatedly different. And I mean, this has a very real basis, you know,

23:59.120 --> 24:04.800
when you look at neurological patients, people who have right hemisphere strokes or examples,

24:05.760 --> 24:12.240
to I know of that both come from the same research group in Switzerland, but involve

24:14.320 --> 24:21.520
a farmer who used to know all his cows by name. And after the right hemisphere right parietal stroke,

24:21.520 --> 24:25.760
he couldn't really, well, he not only couldn't tell his cows one from another,

24:25.760 --> 24:30.480
but he could hardly tell a cow from a horse. And another woman who very plaintively

24:30.480 --> 24:35.040
commented after a right hemisphere stroke, she'd spent her whole life studying the birds of

24:35.040 --> 24:38.880
Switzerland, she was an authority on them. And she said, all the birds look the same.

24:38.880 --> 24:46.240
So that's what happens in the left hemisphere world. Quality is replaced by quantity,

24:47.200 --> 24:54.720
uniqueness is replaced by the category. And then again, the left hemisphere

24:57.200 --> 25:04.480
tends to see things as inanimate, where the right hemisphere will see them as animate.

25:05.280 --> 25:13.600
Well, a category implies in some sense that the members of that category are indistinguishable,

25:13.600 --> 25:17.200
right? Because otherwise you don't have a category, you just have particularity. And so

25:17.200 --> 25:23.600
you could imagine that, I mean, to understand this completely, you have to understand to some

25:23.600 --> 25:32.800
degree what categories are for, or what categories are for, at least in part, you put things that you

25:32.800 --> 25:40.960
can act towards the same way in the same category. And so young children might think of cats and

25:40.960 --> 25:49.040
dogs as dogs, all of them as dogs, because they're cuddly, pettable entities, not because they have

25:49.040 --> 25:53.360
four legs or because they have fur, but because you interact with them the same way. Then you can

25:53.360 --> 25:59.360
differentiate cats and dogs as you get a little older. But the first category, dog, which is pettable

25:59.360 --> 26:05.760
things, is a perfectly reasonable category. And you can imagine that once a categorical structure

26:05.760 --> 26:12.160
has been imposed, that it's easy just to see the category. I wrote an essay in my new book,

26:12.880 --> 26:19.040
which is called Beyond Order, about the function of artists. And I believe that part of what artists

26:19.040 --> 26:23.680
do, and I think this is maybe, you can tell me, but I think it might reflect the differences that

26:23.680 --> 26:31.440
you're talking about. When I was a kid, I lived in a small town, and I can remember all the houses

26:31.440 --> 26:37.680
on my block. I can remember them in detail. They're familiar to me as individual entities, but

26:38.560 --> 26:44.880
now that I'm an adult, I've lived on this street for like 20 years, but the houses are indistinguishable

26:44.880 --> 26:50.960
to me. I can't see them as different entities. And I think it's because I'm so familiar with the

26:50.960 --> 26:57.360
category house, which is a practical category, that I can't see beyond the category. And it's

26:57.360 --> 27:02.560
very efficient, because I know what houses do. They sit there. You don't have to pay attention to

27:02.560 --> 27:09.760
them. And so it's really a useful perceptual shorthand just to see the category. But what

27:09.760 --> 27:14.800
an artist will do is take you outside the category and make you see that the particular is, again,

27:14.800 --> 27:20.640
that you're missing. And I guess that's partly the context, to remind you of what's beyond

27:21.520 --> 27:28.720
what your memory forces you now to see. And is that akin to this distinction that you're

27:28.720 --> 27:34.560
making between the left and the right? Well, it is a distinction. It's a related distinction,

27:34.560 --> 27:40.240
but not exactly the same distinction. I mean, interestingly, it relates to the difference,

27:40.240 --> 27:44.080
a very important difference. In fact, I think probably the single most important difference

27:44.080 --> 27:50.320
of all, which doesn't first strike people, partly because they're so used to living in a world of

27:50.400 --> 27:56.960
representations. That is the distinction between the presencing of something as it comes into being

27:56.960 --> 28:03.360
for you and your mental representation of it, which is like a caricature, or a category thing,

28:03.360 --> 28:14.480
or a verbal sign, so that the left hemisphere's addiction, if you like, to understanding things

28:14.480 --> 28:23.200
via language is very important. Because after all, language makes everything the same. As

28:23.200 --> 28:29.520
Nietzsche said, it makes the uncommon common. Because when you say somebody's got brown hair

28:29.520 --> 28:34.320
or something, then you've got everything just like in a category. But when you see that person,

28:34.320 --> 28:39.200
there's something quite different about the way their hair is and so forth. And you'd find that

28:39.200 --> 28:44.960
out if you painted it. Because you wouldn't paint it with brown paint. You'd paint it with a multitude

28:44.960 --> 28:49.760
of colors if you were really looking at it. And you'd see that it wasn't brown. And I mean,

28:49.760 --> 28:55.360
artists play with, was it Manet who painted the haystacks or Monet, I don't remember,

28:56.400 --> 29:01.760
at multiple different times of the year? And the haystack, I mean, the shape was the same,

29:01.760 --> 29:06.320
but the haystack was completely different. And that's really, in some sense, what he was portraying

29:06.320 --> 29:15.760
was the category is haystack, but the reality is extraordinarily complex. But the category

29:15.760 --> 29:22.560
seems to have functional significance. So you dump things together that you can act towards the same

29:22.560 --> 29:31.040
way. And then a word is labeled on top of that to serve as an even further compressed shorthand

29:31.040 --> 29:39.360
for that category. So you have a complex world, it's multitudinous, and too complex to even see.

29:39.360 --> 29:46.640
And then there's a perceptual act that categorizes that into like a perceptual image house, say,

29:46.640 --> 29:52.640
and then there's a further compression and eradication of information that enables that

29:52.640 --> 29:59.280
to be represented by a word. Well, the Greek philologist Max Muller said,

29:59.280 --> 30:05.760
it's interesting that we read encyclopedias, we have dictionaries, we read books, and we are

30:05.760 --> 30:14.080
with all these words, but none of the things that these words represent actually exist,

30:14.080 --> 30:18.800
because in the act of being represented, they are no longer the thing that was present,

30:18.800 --> 30:22.480
the very fact of representing it suddenly stops the presence of the thing. For me,

30:22.480 --> 30:26.480
this is very vivid in Wordsworth. And this comes back to some of the things you were saying about

30:26.480 --> 30:34.880
the liveliness of the childhood mind, that when he was a young man, and 50 years a boy,

30:34.880 --> 30:41.120
rambling in the Lake District, the world was very much still alive to him and coming into

30:41.120 --> 30:47.760
being for him, but that as a man, he went back there and as it were, couldn't avoid seeing

30:47.760 --> 30:54.240
the landscape as, oh, a picturesque mountain, a picturesque lake, one of those if you like.

30:54.240 --> 30:58.400
And this is what he means by the phrase, the shades of the prison house,

30:58.400 --> 31:08.400
closing round the growing boy in his intimations of immortality on reflection in early childhood.

31:08.400 --> 31:17.760
So this is from this book. There was a time when Meadow groven streamed the earth and every

31:17.760 --> 31:23.440
common sight, to me did seem appareled in celestial light, the glory and the freshness

31:24.160 --> 31:29.200
of a dream. Yes. That's it. This is what I'm referring to. And this really is one of the

31:29.200 --> 31:35.840
more important differences. I would say probably the core difference, that as it were, one world

31:35.840 --> 31:44.800
is real, vibrant, unknown in part, only known ever to a degree, and ever more coming into being,

31:44.800 --> 31:49.440
and ever more coming into knowledge for the right hemisphere. And for the left hemisphere,

31:49.440 --> 31:54.800
already cold, finished, known, dead, put in a book, stuffed on the shelf, filed away.

31:55.600 --> 32:02.160
And we now live so much in this virtual, represented world, partly because they're

32:02.160 --> 32:08.480
very much cut off from nature, which constantly reminds you of its vivid, uncertain liveliness.

32:08.480 --> 32:15.040
It confronts you with its audacious beauty and vitality all the time, partly because we've

32:15.040 --> 32:20.880
learnt to cut our minds off from our bodies. And so we think in this enormously abstract way,

32:20.880 --> 32:27.120
and partly because of city life, partly because of technology, which means we interact with two

32:27.120 --> 32:32.240
dimensional screens, rather than the three dimensional depth, which is in a room when

32:32.240 --> 32:38.160
you're with someone, which is why, as you know, and I know, because we've both helped patients

32:38.160 --> 32:43.680
in our time, that it's very important to be in the room with the patient. It's a completely

32:43.760 --> 32:48.720
different thing that happens from anything you can do on the telephone, or even like this.

32:51.200 --> 32:56.960
So part of the philosophical case that you're making is, I believe that,

32:58.240 --> 33:05.840
while we have a terrible conundrum as human beings, we need, in some sense, for the purposes of

33:05.840 --> 33:12.080
efficiency to move towards the most efficient representations possible. And this has real

33:12.640 --> 33:16.880
bearing on the nature of perception itself. So I know, for example, that even in the primary

33:16.880 --> 33:23.520
visual cortex, so in principle, you know this, but I'm going to explain it for people who are listening,

33:25.120 --> 33:30.080
as the signals, as the pattern signals from your retina move back towards your brain,

33:30.080 --> 33:37.840
they move upwards, so to speak, through a hierarchy of processing units. And even at the first stages

33:37.840 --> 33:44.400
of that processing, there's still more top down input from other brain centers than there is input

33:44.400 --> 33:49.280
from the retinal structures themselves. And so what that implies is that even at the beginnings

33:49.280 --> 33:54.880
of perception, you know, if you think about it as being built up from perceptual elements up

33:54.880 --> 33:59.680
towards the whole gestalt, which isn't exactly accurate, but it'll do for now, even at the

33:59.680 --> 34:04.400
beginnings of the visual process, there's more input from what's inside than there is from the

34:04.400 --> 34:09.680
external world, so to speak, or at least as much. And then what seems to happen as we age is that,

34:09.680 --> 34:17.520
perhaps, is that increasingly, that perception becomes solipsistic. And so we're only seeing

34:17.520 --> 34:22.080
what we know. And that's extraordinarily efficient, because it's very hard to build up a new perception.

34:22.720 --> 34:27.360
You have to really investigate something in detail to see it anew. Whereas if it's the

34:27.360 --> 34:32.320
same old thing that you've seen 10,000 times, you can already use what you know. And it's not

34:32.320 --> 34:36.480
surprising you'd be annoyed if you were forced to jump out of that, because there's a tremendous

34:36.480 --> 34:40.720
amount of work that has to be done if you want to see something for the first time again.

34:42.400 --> 34:50.160
Well, as we both know, people would rather deny obvious truths than let go of a cherished belief.

34:50.160 --> 34:59.600
So that's certainly right. And we don't perceive the world as, you know, in a naive way. We come

34:59.680 --> 35:06.880
to the world with our history, with our vast range of experience. And so, as you say, this top-down

35:08.400 --> 35:14.560
effects on the lower end of things, of the lower end of perception, from higher cognitive functions.

35:15.520 --> 35:20.320
But that's an image of something very important to the philosophy I try to put across in the

35:20.320 --> 35:27.120
matter with things, which is that in order to understand any element in experience,

35:28.080 --> 35:37.360
it's at least as important to see what holes it goes to make up, or potentially can go to make up,

35:37.360 --> 35:42.960
as it is to see what it turns into when you break it down. In fact, often it's not very revealing

35:42.960 --> 35:46.080
to find out what happens when you break it down. And so, in a way-

35:46.080 --> 35:52.960
Psychology suffers from that. Psychology is a discipline that consists, at least in its present

35:53.040 --> 35:59.520
form, mostly of disparate experiments, which demonstrate very particular things about how

35:59.520 --> 36:06.560
people behave in very particular circumstances. But there's very little that unites that back up

36:06.560 --> 36:14.000
to something that isn't merely fragmentary observation. And so, it's very difficult to get

36:14.000 --> 36:21.040
a grip on. And there's billions of potential separate observations. And they're not that

36:21.040 --> 36:26.880
helpful in some sense. Well, it's all part of the world picture, which from the philosophical

36:26.880 --> 36:33.760
point of view is the purpose of the long book, which I sent to you in manuscript, The Matter

36:33.760 --> 36:42.240
with Things. And effectively, I can state quite simply that I want to give a considered

36:42.800 --> 36:51.360
response to the philosophy of our age, which is that there is only matter, and that things

36:51.360 --> 36:58.160
are understood by reducing them to their parts, unless it doesn't change them. It's a very naive

36:58.160 --> 37:05.360
philosophy. It's simplistic, and it's immoral, because it changes the way we treat the world

37:05.360 --> 37:12.320
and other people and nature. It changes our idea of who we are in a very damaging way,

37:12.320 --> 37:18.160
ruling out things that other traditions have traditionally held as very powerful.

37:18.720 --> 37:24.000
And coming back to your comment about how people cling on to things that they believe,

37:24.000 --> 37:28.960
and it's much more difficult to try and see something in a different way, especially with age.

37:29.600 --> 37:33.680
This is why, of course, most traditions of spiritual growth

37:36.480 --> 37:42.800
enjoin on the person paradoxes, to see things in a completely new way that violates all the

37:42.800 --> 37:49.920
ways that they thought they knew. So I use paradox in this new book, but not in some blind way.

37:49.920 --> 37:56.800
In fact, I show that what we mean by a paradox is that the view of the left hemisphere of something

37:56.800 --> 38:01.680
and the view taken of the right hemisphere of the same thing can never actually completely

38:01.680 --> 38:09.440
marry up. They have different qualities, and if you push the comparison or the desire to make

38:09.440 --> 38:15.120
them logically come together too far, you end up with a paradox. And this started happening

38:16.480 --> 38:24.080
early on in the ancient Greek period of philosophy with Xeno. This is where the first

38:24.080 --> 38:30.880
paradoxes come from, and I have a whole chapter on paradox, which I see as generated by the desire

38:30.880 --> 38:36.160
of the left hemisphere to say it must be this or it must be that, clinging on preferentially to the

38:36.160 --> 38:42.000
very fragmentary view of the left hemisphere. See, the left hemisphere is not good at understanding.

38:42.000 --> 38:48.000
That sounds a very blanket statement, and it is. But the whole of the first part of that book,

38:48.080 --> 38:57.280
the new book, is massively more thorough neuropsychology than is in the master and his emissary.

38:57.280 --> 39:03.360
So it's about as thorough as I could possibly make it. And what I do is I look at the ways

39:03.360 --> 39:09.120
in which we have any chance of getting an idea of what the world is. What are the portals of entry

39:09.760 --> 39:16.800
of, if you like, information about the world to us? And I take it that it depends very much on

39:16.800 --> 39:22.640
our attention, how we dispose our attention, perception, the judgments we form on the basis

39:22.640 --> 39:32.640
of perception, the ways in which we apprehend what we're dealing with, rather than comprehend it,

39:32.640 --> 39:39.040
in other words, grasp it, as we say, with the right hand of the left hemisphere, take it, use it.

39:39.840 --> 39:47.440
And how we understand it in terms of emotional intelligence, which is not a small thing,

39:47.440 --> 39:52.000
it's the whole way in which we understand everything human by emotional, I don't mean

39:52.000 --> 39:58.000
sort of in some, you know what I mean, I'm talking about social and emotional understanding,

39:58.000 --> 40:03.440
the sort of thing that is absent in people with autism. And cognitive intelligence,

40:03.440 --> 40:09.360
this may surprise people, but that all these things and creativity, so creativity,

40:10.080 --> 40:17.040
intelligence of the cognitive kind, IQ kind, emotional and social intelligence, apprehension

40:17.920 --> 40:24.080
is a separate case, I'll come to that in a second, perception and attention and judgment,

40:24.080 --> 40:29.680
all these are better performed by the right hemisphere, only apprehension is better performed

40:29.680 --> 40:34.800
by the left hemisphere. So the only thing the left hemisphere is better at is getting a hold on

40:34.800 --> 40:43.680
either an idea, very precise, clear one, or on a thing that it wants to use, but all the manifold

40:43.680 --> 40:48.400
complexity, which our intelligence brings to bear in order to understand the world, all of that is

40:48.400 --> 40:54.400
better done by the right hemisphere. And I can say that on the basis not just of experiments in

40:54.400 --> 40:59.520
normal subjects, but on seeing what happens when you have either left hemisphere damage or right

40:59.520 --> 41:05.680
hemisphere damage, to summarize a vast chunk of information, which I hope will be there for

41:05.680 --> 41:13.120
people to read very, very soon. To summarize that very briefly, what one would say is that when you

41:13.120 --> 41:18.720
have damage to the right hemisphere, your grasp of reality is the main thing that's impaired,

41:18.720 --> 41:23.680
you don't understand it, you don't connect with it, your ability to understand what's going on,

41:24.240 --> 41:28.960
disappears. Whereas when you have a right hemisphere, sorry, when you have a,

41:28.960 --> 41:32.480
that's when you have a right hemisphere, when you have a left hemisphere stroke,

41:32.480 --> 41:36.160
the main things are you have difficulty speaking and using your right hand, they're

41:36.160 --> 41:42.080
practically very important, but essentially the understanding of the world, the grasp of the

41:42.080 --> 41:47.520
meaning of the world, so we have to use these words grasp again, but the overall comprehension

41:47.520 --> 41:53.120
of the world is sustained by the right hemisphere. Okay, so let me ask you a question. Can I,

41:53.120 --> 41:59.840
sure, go ahead. All right, okay. All right, okay, let me just make this point. Because I want to,

41:59.840 --> 42:05.120
people might say, well, okay, but so what? We've both got right and left hemispheres,

42:05.680 --> 42:10.560
so we're not missing anything, so does it matter? Well, yes, it matters very importantly for my

42:10.560 --> 42:17.040
philosophical project, because as I show in the second part of the book, where I look at the proper

42:18.000 --> 42:23.680
contributions to understanding made by reason, science, intuition and imagination,

42:26.880 --> 42:34.880
what I can show is that in those attempts to grasp, we can see the world, we can see the

42:34.880 --> 42:39.840
signature of the right hemisphere or the signature of the left hemisphere on a particular model.

42:39.840 --> 42:46.720
So if we have two possible models of a certain action or an aspect of reality or space or time,

42:46.800 --> 42:51.680
which I deal with in the third part of the book, and indeed in philosophical history and in the

42:51.680 --> 42:58.080
history of physics and so on, there have tended to be opposing views of the world. Once you know

42:58.080 --> 43:03.040
how the left hemisphere sees it and how the right hemisphere tends to see things, you can see the

43:03.040 --> 43:09.120
hallmark of the left hemisphere's understanding on a certain philosophical standpoint, on a certain

43:09.120 --> 43:17.520
scientific take of the world, and you can see the hallmark and the imprint of the right hemisphere

43:17.520 --> 43:23.760
in certain other ways of reasoning and of science and philosophy. So this is very important,

43:23.760 --> 43:29.120
because up till now, we've never been able to judge between these two. We've got A, we've got B,

43:29.120 --> 43:33.760
we just have to go, hmm, can't tell, we can't reconcile them, we can't do without either of them.

43:34.560 --> 43:42.080
That's true, ultimately that's true, but we can get a very sharp idea, I believe now,

43:43.120 --> 43:47.760
of which of these is fallacious, which one is going to lead us down a blind alley, which one

43:47.760 --> 43:52.640
is out of touch with reality and which one is more in touch with reality. I just wanted to say that,

43:52.640 --> 43:58.160
because it's behind the whole philosophical drift of my book, which is how do we know who we are?

43:58.160 --> 44:04.400
I asked Plotinus his question, who are we? That's effectively the question, what is the cosmos,

44:04.400 --> 44:12.080
what is nature, and how do we all relate? Sorry, I hand over to you. No, no, that's good. Okay, so

44:13.920 --> 44:20.720
to do something, you have to zero in on it. So let me lay something out for you, and then I'm

44:20.720 --> 44:25.600
going to ask you a specific question about it. So imagine that I'm concentrating on the computer

44:25.600 --> 44:29.760
screen, I'm attending to it, I'm writing a book. Okay, so the question might be, well, what am I

44:29.760 --> 44:37.360
doing while I'm writing that book? What is it to write that book? Well, at the most focused level

44:37.360 --> 44:45.520
of my consciousness, the most focal level, that involves voluntary control of my fingers. I'm going

44:45.520 --> 44:50.080
to be typing single letters, and there are muscle movements that are associated with that, but I

44:50.080 --> 44:54.640
don't really know what the muscle movements are, I know how to move my fingers, that's the highest

44:54.720 --> 45:00.000
level of resolution I can manage. I can press T with my left hand and H with my right hand,

45:01.760 --> 45:07.760
with these two fingers. And so that's sort of where the pedal hits the metal, in some sense,

45:07.760 --> 45:14.320
that's where my intent meets the world. Okay, so, but I'm not typing letters, sorry, I am typing

45:14.320 --> 45:19.440
letters, but at the same time I'm typing words. And at the same time I'm typing words, I'm typing

45:19.440 --> 45:26.080
phrases. And then I'm typing sentences, and I'm typing paragraphs, and I'm typing chapters,

45:26.080 --> 45:31.600
and then I'm typing books. And then the book itself is an artifact that's nested inside

45:32.560 --> 45:38.160
higher order structures. So, well, I'm writing the book, but the reason I can write the book is

45:38.160 --> 45:46.720
because I'm imagining a world within which the book is nested. And so I'm focusing on something

45:46.720 --> 45:52.080
very specific, like I can't write the book without pushing the letter T with my left index finger,

45:52.720 --> 45:57.760
but I also can't write the book without apprehending the book as a whole. And, you know, when I edit,

45:58.320 --> 46:04.000
I edit not letters because I can spell, but I edit words, I substitute one word for another,

46:04.000 --> 46:09.120
I edit phrases, I edit sentences, I edit at the paragraph level, like all of these levels actually

46:09.120 --> 46:16.880
exist. Now, is it reasonable to suppose? So, sorry, I'm going to add one more level outside

46:16.880 --> 46:21.600
that. So you might ask, well, why am I writing a book? And it might be, well, because I'm a

46:21.600 --> 46:30.160
practicing scientist, and why is that important? Well, I'm a dutiful citizen, let's say, trying

46:30.160 --> 46:34.080
to uphold my moral responsibility. And you might say, well, why is that important? And I would say,

46:34.080 --> 46:41.280
well, that's part of my proper moral engagement with the world. And then I can't go further

46:41.280 --> 46:47.360
outside than that. Now, is it reasonable to suppose, if you think about that whole structure as a kind

46:47.360 --> 46:53.520
of lens that focuses us in the world, is it reasonable to suppose that it's the left hemisphere,

46:53.520 --> 46:59.200
so to speak, that's concentrating on the T's and the H's, and that as you move up that hierarchy

46:59.200 --> 47:05.440
to broader and broader levels of conceptualization, that the manner in which those higher levels

47:05.440 --> 47:08.960
are conceptualized shifts more and more to the right, or is processed more and more by the

47:08.960 --> 47:14.240
right, is that a reasonable way of looking at it? I think you could, but I'd need to sort of gloss

47:14.240 --> 47:22.160
it a bit. And what you've beautifully described is what the right hemisphere knows, and which

47:22.160 --> 47:27.840
John Muir summarized by saying, if you try to get hold of any one thing and pull it, you find that

47:28.160 --> 47:32.560
bring with it the whole of the rest of the universe, yet that sentence you're writing

47:34.240 --> 47:39.680
is informed by your personal history and the history, therefore, of your culture,

47:39.680 --> 47:45.680
and therefore, and so on and so on and so forth. So everything that has gone to make you is present

47:45.680 --> 47:52.720
in that business of the book. And so you're not, of course, at any one time aware of more than a

47:52.720 --> 48:00.960
tiny bit. But there's a very fallacious and superficial argument that if you're not conscious of

48:00.960 --> 48:06.960
it, in that sense of the word conscious, then somehow you're not doing it. But of course you are,

48:06.960 --> 48:13.760
the whole thing emanates from what I call the field of view. Now, suppose rather than, you know,

48:13.760 --> 48:18.480
we can take the example of the typing, but you wouldn't be able to type at all if you were

48:18.480 --> 48:25.360
thinking about what your fingers were doing. And, you know, but nonetheless, it would be stupid to

48:25.360 --> 48:28.880
say that you're unconscious while you're typing. Of course, you're not unconscious.

48:29.920 --> 48:35.280
Somebody playing a Bach fugue has got to use all their fingers and their hands, you know,

48:35.280 --> 48:40.640
and their feet at the same time. And if they concentrated, they could only concentrate and

48:40.640 --> 48:45.680
focus on one finger. Of course, that would stop the whole music for a start. But they're, they're

48:45.680 --> 48:49.920
conscious, of course, they're just as conscious when the whole thing's happening as they are if

48:49.920 --> 48:56.080
they think about the finger and stop it. So what this illustrates is what Alfred North Whitehead

48:57.040 --> 49:04.640
was keen to point out that as soon as we master something, we relegate it to another part of

49:04.640 --> 49:11.040
the mind that we don't any longer have to focus on. And the focusing of tension is costly. He said,

49:11.040 --> 49:20.000
it's like cavalry charges in battle. It should only be done rarely. You need fresh horses and it

49:20.000 --> 49:26.000
comes at a high cost. So that's a good analogy. Because you build a you build a little machine,

49:26.000 --> 49:32.240
the things, the things, the things that the things that we do unconsciously are in no way

49:32.240 --> 49:38.160
inferior stuff. So for example, the Bach fugue is not inferior. When a surgeon is learning,

49:38.960 --> 49:44.240
he or she has to be very conscious of what he or she's doing, the actual business of the hand

49:44.240 --> 49:51.840
cutting. But when the surgeon is very skilled, he can hum, listen to the radio chat with colleagues,

49:51.840 --> 49:56.960
and it's all happening. Similarly, a chess player, a bad chess player has to be conscious of every

49:56.960 --> 50:02.560
move, but a really good one is not unconscious. It's very, very highly conscious, but it's not

50:02.640 --> 50:10.400
focused. Now, my distinction to sorry, finally answer your question is that is that focused

50:10.400 --> 50:16.720
attention, this focal attention on the detail is what the left hemisphere does. It can only

50:16.720 --> 50:23.280
take in about three degrees for the attentional art. So it's incredibly limited. And as as Whitehead

50:23.280 --> 50:30.800
says, it has its uses in an emergency. But really, it's not a satisfactory way for living. And what

50:30.800 --> 50:35.920
I think is happening is that we are now more and more saying anything that I'm not actually focusing

50:35.920 --> 50:42.320
on right now doesn't exist. All the implicit stuff, all the unconscious stuff, all the things that go

50:42.320 --> 50:49.040
to make up the richness of our both cognitive and emotional and embodied cells, isn't really

50:49.040 --> 50:55.200
important. We focus down on this tiny bit that the relatively unintelligent left hemisphere

50:55.760 --> 51:01.760
knows about and is aware of. So when I say conscious and unconscious, I like to say,

51:01.760 --> 51:08.880
don't think of these as two separate realms, like, you know, two tanks with perhaps a trap and things

51:08.880 --> 51:13.920
can pop up from the lower tank into the higher tank or whatever. But instead, think of it like

51:13.920 --> 51:19.200
a stage, and there's a spotlight. And the spotlight may just illuminate one part of the

51:19.200 --> 51:23.200
stage, but the rest of the stage hasn't gone anywhere. It's still there. And you just need

51:23.200 --> 51:27.280
to move the spotlight. And suddenly it's there again in the middle of what you're thinking about.

51:27.280 --> 51:33.680
That's how I would see that question. Okay, so let's go back to this typing example again. Just

51:34.480 --> 51:40.800
so when you learn to type, you're going to be paying conscious attention to pushing the T's and

51:40.800 --> 51:48.400
the H's. As you learn to type, you start perhaps being conscious more of maybe you're attending

51:48.400 --> 51:54.000
at the level of the phrase. Like, you don't have to be consciously attentive to those things you've

51:54.000 --> 52:00.560
built automated machinery for. Now they say when kids learn to read, it isn't enjoyable to begin with

52:00.560 --> 52:06.720
because it's effortful to learn to process the letters, and it's effortful to learn to process

52:06.720 --> 52:12.320
the words. And it's not until they can automatize the letter and word processing, and so they can

52:12.320 --> 52:18.160
read the word at a glance, that they start to be able to be conscious of the phrase and the sentence,

52:18.160 --> 52:21.920
and that's when they get the meaning from the text, and that's when it starts to become

52:22.480 --> 52:28.000
enjoyable, right? It's not just effortful. And then, so the consciousness of a reader isn't

52:28.000 --> 52:32.160
consciousness of letters, and it's not consciousness of words. It's consciousness of something like

52:32.160 --> 52:37.760
the interplay between sentences and paragraphs. And it's like your consciousness floats above

52:38.320 --> 52:44.480
the highest level of automatization that you've been able to manage. Does that seem reasonable to

52:44.480 --> 52:50.320
you? Well, I mean, when you're playing a musical piece, for example, you don't pay attention to

52:50.320 --> 52:55.440
what you've practiced because you've got that. You pay attention to the sequencing of what you've

52:55.440 --> 53:01.280
practiced. And the greater a musician you are, the higher up in the abstraction hierarchy,

53:01.280 --> 53:07.680
you can focus because you've automated all the lower stuff. Well, yes, and that comes back to

53:07.680 --> 53:13.200
what, I'm sorry. No, I was, I was, I'm trying to get the relationship between that and the

53:13.200 --> 53:20.000
hemisphere specialization. Well, I think I've done my best to point out that the right hemisphere

53:20.560 --> 53:26.560
is the one that is able to attend to the whole Gestalt ultimately is dealing not in

53:27.200 --> 53:32.480
fragmentary entities that have to be put together, but in Gestalt and that already exist and are

53:32.480 --> 53:38.800
nested so that you go down from one level and you find another, you know, famously you can go from

53:38.880 --> 53:44.640
the, from the body to the organ to the tissue to the cell to the organelle to the, you know,

53:44.640 --> 53:52.400
and each of these at each stage is a whole that has its own qualities and its own rules

53:52.400 --> 54:00.240
really and works in a semi-autonomous way. So there's always freedom between the levels of

54:00.240 --> 54:05.840
understanding. There's always space. It's rather like the gaps in the structure are where the light

54:05.840 --> 54:10.560
gets in. You know, if you tighten everything up, then you've got total darkness. So what we're

54:10.560 --> 54:16.240
trying to do all the time is to know enough to be able to act, but to leave it open so that we

54:16.240 --> 54:21.680
can know more and really understand where we are and what we're doing when we're acting. So I think

54:21.680 --> 54:26.720
these are significant differences between the left hemisphere which is utterly goal directed

54:28.000 --> 54:35.120
and very direct in the way in which it achieves or aims to achieve its goal and the right hemisphere

54:35.120 --> 54:43.120
which is sustaining this and also seeing the goal in a wider whole. You know, the reason of typing

54:43.120 --> 54:47.200
these letters is not just to make the keys go up and down and to have a bit of paper at the end of

54:47.200 --> 54:53.680
it, but because you want to influence minds that are now unaware of this but will know about it

54:53.680 --> 54:58.800
soon. So I think it's the difference between this very, again, Whitehead says there's a

54:58.800 --> 55:06.560
civilization advances by the number of actions that can be made automatic or below the level.

55:06.560 --> 55:14.080
Sorry? Without thinking. Without thinking. Because thinking is very complex thing,

55:14.080 --> 55:18.960
isn't it? I mean, what is it? And a number of people have commented rather along the lines

55:18.960 --> 55:25.920
that I'm saying that it's not so much right to say I think as in Kogito, but in the words of

55:25.920 --> 55:34.240
Lichtenberg, the 18th century German philosopher and physicist, esdenkt, esdenkt in mir, something

55:34.240 --> 55:41.760
is thinking in me. And that is the me. It's not separate and it's not unconscious in the sense of

55:43.520 --> 55:47.920
it has no life, it has no meaning, it has no purpose, it has no direction. Absolutely not,

55:47.920 --> 55:53.680
it has all those things. And one of the things I'm trying to argue in the last part of,

55:54.560 --> 55:58.320
may I say something just about the structure of this book? I started off on it, this new book

55:58.320 --> 56:02.400
and I'm just going to say a little bit more about it. Yeah, yeah. So I've explained the first part.

56:02.400 --> 56:06.800
Yeah, well we're trying to grasp something large going through its parts and it's not such a simple

56:06.800 --> 56:12.800
thing to do. It's not a simple thing to do. So the first part of the book I've explained,

56:13.440 --> 56:20.720
it gives one an insight into a simple fact that in terms of having access to the reality of the

56:20.720 --> 56:27.680
world, the right hemisphere is better than the left. And it has a special take, if you like,

56:27.680 --> 56:32.160
which we can recognize so that when we're having to choose between two opposites, we can choose one

56:32.880 --> 56:37.280
if we want to over the other. And then the second part of the book, I'm looking at the

56:37.280 --> 56:43.440
pathways to knowledge, using attention, perception, judgment, intelligence, how do we put them to use?

56:43.440 --> 56:49.440
Well, I think the main ones are science, reason, I think most people would say they're important,

56:49.440 --> 56:56.080
I would say intuition and imagination are also vastly important. Now none of these is infallible,

56:56.080 --> 57:00.720
none of these can say that it can deal with everything. There are proper limits to science,

57:00.720 --> 57:08.480
otherwise you're peddling untenable naive scientism. But it is a very important thing

57:08.480 --> 57:15.840
for us to respect and to do honorably. Reason is enormously important. I use science and reason

57:15.840 --> 57:22.160
as the basis of my book. But again, reason, as Pascal, famous mathematician and philosopher said,

57:22.160 --> 57:28.960
reason is poor if it cannot see its own limitations. And so it has limitations,

57:28.960 --> 57:33.760
but it can achieve a very great deal. And the same actually is true of intuition. It's had a

57:33.760 --> 57:40.160
very bad press in recent years, because I think, again, psychologists, I think you've alluded to

57:40.160 --> 57:44.960
this, they like things that can be taken down into bits and shown them, we can find the mechanism.

57:44.960 --> 57:52.160
Intuition is a bit hard for that. And imagination has been, again, relegated to the sort of children's

57:52.160 --> 57:59.760
playbox that this is something to do with fantasy. Whereas in fact, I argue that quite the opposite,

57:59.760 --> 58:04.080
but whereas fantasy may be an interesting decoration on things that we already know,

58:04.640 --> 58:09.840
and the left hemisphere can do that. Imagination is actually how we go to meet the world and

58:09.840 --> 58:15.680
understand it. And we have to imagine it into being. There is no alternative. If we are not

58:15.680 --> 58:19.920
imaginatively engaged with the world, we just can't see a lot of things that are there.

58:20.880 --> 58:28.800
So we need to use all of these faculties together, not just one or two as we now do. Sorry, Carol.

58:28.800 --> 58:35.200
Well, I wanted to comment on your discussion of imagination and the manner in which it brings

58:35.200 --> 58:43.040
the world into being. So we've already discussed the fact that the realm of your experience is

58:43.040 --> 58:49.280
dependent to some degree on your attention, and that that's associated with intent. And intent

58:49.280 --> 58:55.920
seems to me to be it's future oriented to have an intent. Intent means to attempt to move from one

58:55.920 --> 59:01.600
place to another. And hypothetically, it's a better place because why move otherwise. And so

59:02.320 --> 59:08.880
to act in the world with intent means that you're playing out something that's imaginative because

59:08.880 --> 59:15.360
to posit that one thing is better than another, and therefore want to move towards it, you have to

59:15.360 --> 59:20.640
have imagined up a better world. And so what that means in some sense is that we're always meeting

59:20.640 --> 59:27.360
the world in a way that imposes our imaginative attempts to make it better upon us, upon the

59:27.360 --> 59:36.880
world. But that also brings the world into being. And so and I guess I'm saying that because I'm

59:36.880 --> 59:43.680
trying to grapple with the why of your book again. You're implying throughout and more than implying

59:43.680 --> 59:51.920
that we have a paucity of viewpoint that's demotivating and dangerous. And you're implying as

59:51.920 --> 59:57.920
well that that has something to do with our obsessive concentration or utilization of left

59:57.920 --> 01:00:03.360
hemisphere functions. And that that reminds me of Heidegger to some degree and his claim that

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:08.720
moderners use the world as produce, you know, that we tend to reduce everything to its functional

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:14.000
utility insofar as it can be exploited. And like I have some sympathy for that because we have to

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:22.640
the world to live. But yes, it it it. So let's say we do lose something by being specific.

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:29.600
And narrow, we gain something which is functional utility. What do we do about that?

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:33.920
You're trying to understand it and why it is what do we do to fight against it?

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:41.680
Well, that's a whole separate question. But at the moment, I'm trying to unpack

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:48.480
what the problem is. Okay, well, I won't push past that. Yeah, I mean, I mean,

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:55.600
quite what we do about it is the million dollar question. And we may not be in a position

01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:02.240
unless we radically alter the way in which we think about the world, understand it and feel

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:09.120
it and experience it and interact with it. We may not have a world in which to live. So it's

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:16.960
a pretty important topic. But in so having sort of more or less, as it were, gone over what are

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:21.920
the portals to understanding, what are the paths to understanding, I then in the part three, which

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:28.240
is really, if you like, the reason we've had parts one and two, you can't get to part three without

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:34.880
them. But when you get there, we want to know, so what is the world like? And so I look at the

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:40.400
structure of the world, the theories about it and what we can tell from physics and from

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:45.440
the hemisphere hypothesis, what parts of it we may be perceiving with the left hemisphere and what

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:51.280
we may be seeing with the right. And I look at the structure in the sense of the coming together

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:56.000
of opposites and the very interesting philosophical question of the relationship between the one

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:05.600
and the many. And then in the rest of the book, I look at time, space, motion, meaning largely flow,

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:18.000
but all kinds of motion, matter and consciousness, value, purpose, and the sense of the sacred.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:25.120
Now, I argue that these elements like consciousness are not secondary, they're not

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:30.960
derivative, it's actually irrational to suppose they are. Reason is on the side of the fact that

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:38.080
they are ontological primaries. And I argue that actually also unpack that for people because it's

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:44.880
there's a lot, but it would take a very long time. Well, I can unpack the phrase what I mean by

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:52.960
ontological primary is that it can't be reduced to other terms. It can't be said that as long as

01:02:52.960 --> 01:03:00.000
you look at a brain in a certain way, you can work out what consciousness is. Consciousness is

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:06.880
sui generis. It is of its own kind. It is not something that is derived from anything. It has

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:13.680
to be a primary constituent of the universe. This is not a particularly any longer controversial view.

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:22.160
It's held by many philosophers now in the form of panpsychism in which something like consciousness

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:28.480
is in the cosmos and the cosmos perhaps exists inside consciousness, not my consciousness, but

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:35.840
a consciousness field. And there are plenty of neuroscientists who say this too.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:43.360
Colin Blakemore, not known for being kind of away with the fairies, but they say this too.

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:51.760
But I would also argue, and it's a perhaps harder thing to make comprehensible in a very short

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:57.280
space, but that actually values are things that are there. They're not things we make up. They're

01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:07.840
not things that are like, I rather like that. They are built into the drive of everything.

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:13.440
And I think that the cosmos has drives. You can describe them in all sorts of ways. It has

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:19.760
the fact that it changes and moves in certain ways according to, quote, laws, which may actually

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:24.480
not be laws, but maybe temporary habits. We don't know. They may be evolving too. But the very fact

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:30.480
that this thing has this energy to evolve, to differentiate, to produce differentiation

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:36.880
within union, this is a value of a kind. You can't get behind these. And most of our values,

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:42.000
other than those of utility, this is good for me and I want to have more of it, which is what

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:50.160
the left hemisphere is devoted to. Most of those other values are not reducible to share in the

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:57.120
material greed or feathering your own nest. They're often actually the things that are vastly

01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:02.240
important. Probably the whole point of the being consciousness at all is to come to appreciate

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:08.320
the meaning of truth, goodness and beauty, to have a sense of something awe-inspiring, which is

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:12.960
really what we mean when we talk about the sacred, that we're humble enough to say we don't know

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:17.920
everything and we probably will never know. I mean, why should we? That's also a totally irrational

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:22.560
idea that our brains are so constructed that we should know everything. I mean, a mouse might

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:25.760
think that if it could think that much, you'd think it knows everything, but it doesn't.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:31.120
So, and we're evolving. There may be creatures in the future who think, what the hell did

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:38.480
homo sapiens in 2021 know? So, I just want to get back into the frame that not all the things

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:46.720
that matter to us, they are enormously important aspects of a universe that is not dead and static,

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:52.560
unless given a push, not without purpose, not without meaning, not without value. These things

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:58.560
are in the grain, in the warp and the weft of the cosmos. Of that I'm certain. And the job is

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:07.360
for us to find this. And most philosophers, wise people, sages, whatever you like to call them,

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:13.520
in the past, have adopted a view of the cosmos, which is exactly the one that one would expect

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:19.520
the right hemisphere to hold, which is one in which things are not always certain or known,

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:24.000
they're changing, they're interconnected, but the whole thing has a meaning. It is

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:31.760
not a heap of fragments that don't mean anything. The modern malaise. So, that's really where I'm

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:38.400
driving at, if you see, that's the philosophical goal, is to help people see something that I

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:44.480
think they already intuit. I mean, that was a response to the master and his emissary.

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:51.280
Apart from people enormously movingly writing to me, saying things I never thought I would ever

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:55.840
hear from writing a book, like your book changed my life, and I'm sure you've had this too.

01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:03.120
But, you know, people saying, what you're saying, I kind of knew, I've known this, but I couldn't

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:08.080
find any way of articulating it. Well, there's a reason why you couldn't find a way of articulating

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:14.640
it, and that is articulation in language is controlled by the left hemisphere. It developed

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:18.800
very good tools for mapping out the world in a way that is very useful to its purposes.

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:25.520
But the important things are hard to articulate in words. They're implicit meanings,

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:32.560
all the deep things like love, religion, poetry, music. How do you say these in words? How do you

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:37.920
say them in language? But they have extraordinary meaning and power. They're the things we live for,

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:42.000
not for the things that we can say put down in a notebook, if you know what I mean.

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:50.000
So what's driven you in this direction, do you think? I mean, you made a very large number of

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:58.880
claims in that last section of thought. For example, you've come to the belief that value

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:04.320
is somehow implicit in the structure of being. That's what I understood what you said, and correct

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:10.880
me if I'm wrong, and that it's unfolding across time. I mean, I've been thinking about this

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:22.640
exact issue an awful lot. It's very difficult to formulate this question. So imagine that we're

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:29.840
drawn towards an ideal. Human beings are drawn towards an ideal. Imagine that you can detect

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:35.760
that draw by your own dissatisfaction, in part, is that you don't feel you're living properly,

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:39.840
or your conscience is bothering you. You feel that there's something more to be attained.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:45.200
You're embarrassed at your insufficiencies, right? So there's this ideal that's pulling you onward

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:50.560
and judging you at the same time. And that ideal might be, well, the ideal human being,

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:55.280
that's one way of thinking about it. And that's partly why I got so interested in hero mythology.

01:08:55.280 --> 01:09:04.000
I mean, is it a reasonable conclusion of your line of thinking that the notion of the ideal

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:11.120
human being is somehow built into the structure of the cosmos? Because the class, I don't know how to...

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:15.440
No, it's not. No, I don't think that at all. I want to scotch that immediately.

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:19.680
Okay, well, how do you scotch that if you start with your presuppositions?

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:26.800
Well, because I don't... My presuppositions have nothing to do with an already conceived plan

01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:30.800
that is just being acted out. This takes us back to the bad...

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:33.120
No, it wasn't applying. It wasn't necessarily...

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:36.640
Oh, all right. Well, okay. But let... All right. Okay. Well, I'm glad you weren't.

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:41.600
But a lot of people think that if I say these things, I must be positing an engineering god

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:46.000
who sort of tinkers with things and makes things happen according to his purpose.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.320
Yeah, okay. That's fair. I mean, I was implying that in some sense. I mean,

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:55.280
I thought you might... I guess the question would be, where does your insistence that values are

01:09:55.280 --> 01:10:01.520
part of the structure of being? Like, where does that find its limit? Because the classic limit

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:09.600
of that is something like... In fact, the definition of the utmost place of value in some sense is

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:13.600
almost indistinguishable from the claim that there is a god. And so...

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:19.520
Well, a god is not the same as an engineering god. And I take enormous pains in the book.

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:24.240
It costs me more than anything I've ever written to write the chapter called The Sense of the Sacred,

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:32.240
in which I try to help people to a place where they can understand why people use this

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:38.240
extraordinarily difficult word, God. You know, it's not a satisfactory term,

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:44.400
but it's the term we have to have to name an aspect of our experience that if we don't name it,

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:50.000
disappears from our lives. And that's not to say that there isn't something there that is,

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:57.040
that merits whatever we mean when we say divine. I mean, we haven't defined what we mean by divine.

01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:02.160
And we're back in the nets of language. We're trapped in the nets of language, as Shelling said.

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:10.240
But what I'm suggesting is that, as Whitehead suggested, and come on, Whitehead was also the

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:17.680
co-author with Russell of the Principia Mathematica. He wasn't a fantasist. He had this, I think,

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:27.040
incredibly deep idea that whatever one likes to call the divinity god, whatever, is the thing that

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:34.960
the cosmos has relation with. Relation is at the core of being. I even argue that relation is prior

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:40.000
to the relata, prior to the things that are related. That sounds nonsense. How can you relate,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.400
how can you have a relation if there isn't anything yet to relate? But there's a wonderful image called,

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:51.760
in Indian mythology, called Indra's net, which covers the universe. And in it, the idea is that

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:58.160
the filaments of the net exist before the net, before the crossing points, which are the things

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:03.680
we see. And on those crossing points, there are little gems, which reflect every other gem in

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:08.560
the net. Now, that would take a very long time to unpack, but perhaps it can set things going

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:18.880
in people's minds. But the idea I have is that relation is prior to anything at all, really.

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:24.400
And that therefore, whatever you mean by god, and whatever we mean by the cosmos,

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:30.320
are in some sort of dynamic relation, which is an evolving one in which the outcome is

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:36.000
excitingly not known. If it were known, it would all be some horrible, possibly sadistic

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:44.880
play by an almighty, all-knowing god. I mean, look, I'm going to be talking to Rowan Williams

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:50.640
shortly, but I don't want to go into all that I mean by that. I don't think god is omniscient and

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:55.600
omnipotent, but I don't think he's not either. Just in the same way, I don't think he's green,

01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:00.480
and I don't think he's not green. I think the terms are wrong, but we can go there if we want,

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:08.240
and later or another day. But the thing, what I'm really saying is that God is discovering,

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:15.520
becoming unfulfilling whatever god is through the relationship, which classically in most

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:21.920
religions is described as love, which is after all just like a form of gravity in the world of

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:27.600
life and emotion rather than just in the world of the so-called inanimate.

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:37.040
So that therefore, we are coming into being, god is coming into being, and we're necessary to

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:40.880
one another's coming into being. It's not that god does a bit to us, and then we do a bit back

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:46.080
to god. It's like, I've read a very good book, I keep mentioning it by a young microbiologist

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:53.200
in America called Critishama called Interdependence, and she argues very importantly that it's not

01:13:53.200 --> 01:14:00.400
just that, certainly it's not just that an animal or an organism molds its environment,

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:04.240
nor is it just good enough to recognize that while an animal

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:11.040
affects and shapes its environment, the environment shapes the animal or the organism,

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:18.080
but that this is not a, you know, turn-by-turn process. It's not that the animal shapes the

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:23.440
environment, it should then, in its turn, shapes the animal. It's an entirely

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:29.200
simultaneous process of coming into being, of co-creation, if you like. Now this idea of

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:34.240
simultaneous coming into being is an ancient one, but I think it's a very deep one philosophically,

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:40.560
and a very important one. So that accounts for your objection to the idea of the omniscient determining

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:49.600
god? Absolutely, absolutely, because the god would have no creation. Creation is not really just

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:54.240
the unfolding of something that's already there. What's the name of the book? What's the name of

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:59.600
the book by the microbiologist? It's just called Interdependence. It's by Kriti Sharma.

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:10.480
Can you spell her last name? S-H-A-R-M-A. It's quite a short read. I'm mentioning her quite a lot

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:18.400
these days. Okay, so let me ask you a question. So now I'm going to try to pack up what you're

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:24.800
doing, and so again, tell me if I'm wrong. So we have these opposed viewpoints of the world,

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:31.520
paradoxical viewpoints. They're expressed, they make the hemispheric differences necessary, or

01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:36.960
there are consequences of the hemispheric differences. If there wasn't a paradox, we wouldn't need the

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:42.720
two hemispheres. We need these two different ways of looking at things. We've tilted, we're in danger

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:50.080
of tilting too far to a left hemisphere view, and that's keeping us from, from what? It's keeping us

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:56.320
from apprehension of the relationship with the sacred that you're describing, the co-creation

01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:06.400
relationship. Is that, is that reasonable? Well, it's ruling out so much. I mean, I can't begin to

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:13.680
tell you, but you can imagine all the things that this very reduced abstract schematic bureaucratic,

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:20.400
essentially it's a bureaucratic, you know, you push something, it has an action on something else,

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:24.720
and you know, we can predict the outcome, we can organize it. That's the left hemisphere's vision

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:29.840
of the world, inanimate stuff that it can move about. Very much the Industrial Revolution was a

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:36.960
kind of acting out in the outer world of the world picture of the left hemisphere in some ways. I

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:43.920
talk about that more in the master and his emissary, but it's ruling out, it's ruling out, it's ruling

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:51.920
out everything really. It's ruling out our ability to understand, to see, to see at all. I mean,

01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:58.160
a number of very important people, one of them Goethe said, you know, thinking is good, but seeing

01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:03.920
is so much better. And I think we just don't see things anymore, because we don't expect them,

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:08.160
we don't understand them, we've ruled them out from the word go, because our world picture

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:13.920
just doesn't contain them. And if you stop doing that and start attending in a more flexible way,

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:20.800
you find there's a massively complex and fascinating, rich, nourishing response to your

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:26.960
attention. It's the absence of that that causes the meaning crisis, which is constantly being

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:31.600
bounded about. Well, the Egyptians, you know, the Egyptians knew that, the ancient Egyptians

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:41.520
knew that, because they, they, they, um, they're, the God Horus is the eye and its attention. And

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:48.720
it is Horus that revitalizes Osiris and he's the God of structure. And they saw the, the, the,

01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:54.480
the proper sovereignty was a combination of attention and structure, a dynamic combination

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:59.600
of attention and structure. Well, this is absolutely brilliant. Well, I quite agree,

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:05.440
but this is where we come to, I need to make a correct, a possible misapprehension.

01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:11.840
There is absolutely nothing wrong with the view of the right hemisphere. It's in fact necessary.

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:17.520
It's part of a, of a dialectic backwards and forwards between these two ways in which things

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:22.640
can be built. You can't have the one in a way without the other. You're quite right. We need

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:30.640
them both, but, but we live in an age which is completely obsessed with the idea of equality as

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:38.080
some eternal sort of truth about the cosmos. I have, I can see no evidence for this idea. It's a

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:44.960
lovely idea, a humanly invented idea, which is, which is a good one in society, although it can't

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:50.720
be realized and it may actually not be necessary or even good for it to be ultimately realized.

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:57.120
It might lead to a horrible kind of totalitarianism, as many 20th century philosophers pointed out, but,

01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:01.760
but these two things don't have to be. That's the problem with elevating one virtue above all

01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:07.600
else. It's a left hemisphere problem. Exactly. Well, it's an ideological problem. No, well, no, the

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:13.680
point is this. We need the left and the right, but we need the right to be in control. Now,

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:17.600
this is very important. This is the image of the master and his emissary, the emissary and the

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:22.960
master are not equal. The master needs the emissary and knows he needs the emissary. The emissary

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:29.600
being inferior doesn't know that he needs the master. So the emissary is good as long as he's

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:35.520
under the control of the master. Now, that image is extraordinarily important for understanding

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:46.080
this picture of the cosmos. And it's actually present in ancient Chinese, Navajo, not Navajo,

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:54.800
Iroquois, mythologies and so on, this idea of the being an unequal pair, that one has to be the

01:19:54.800 --> 01:20:01.600
guardian of the other. And as long as the one that is, as it were, a potential problem remains

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:07.760
under the supervision of the wiser one that sees all everything works well for everybody. And that's

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:13.280
why in the master and his emissary, I suggest with three periods in the West, in early Greek

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:17.920
civilization, in the peak of Roman civilization, and again at the Renaissance in the West,

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:23.280
where these were working well together. But in every case, it slid further to the viewpoint of

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:28.160
the left hemisphere. And in every case, the civilization has crumbled. And I see the evidence

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:35.600
for that all around me now. So I'm not saying that we just need these two things. I'm saying we

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:41.520
definitely need them both. Neither of them is bad. But what is bad is for the

01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:48.160
the inferior one, the one that sees less to take control. And it's very easy for it to take control

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:53.200
because like the less intelligent person that thinks it knows everything, he thinks I've got it,

01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:57.440
I've understood it. There's no more, you know, we do three more experiments and we've cracked

01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:02.480
the universe, you know, it's all just a matter of, you know, a few years of science and we'll

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:10.160
understand that. Let me let you in on some of the things I've been grappling with here. So

01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:17.680
I talked, I talked to Matt Ridley and Bjorn Lauburg recently, and their enthusiastic

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:25.120
Enlightenment rationalists, I would say there, they look at what's happened as a consequence of

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:29.200
the Industrial Revolution and the tremendous technological advances that that's produced

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:35.200
and the immense increase in human well-being. And they say we can continue with that into the

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:41.200
future. We can produce a world and perhaps are already producing a world where poverty is

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:45.440
increasingly going to be a thing of the past. And we can bring the rest of the world up to the

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:50.960
standards of living that characterize the West and and we can continue to expand the pie. And

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:57.280
I'm not interested in discussing whether that's possible or not, because it's possibly possible

01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:03.920
and possibly not. But it's a particular vision, right? It's a vision of the extension of material

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:10.320
comfort to everyone. And that comfort has been extended tremendously over the last two or 300

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:15.040
years. It's absolutely amazing. And I would say in large part, it's a consequence of that left

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:21.840
hemisphere reduction of the world to manageable bits and the manipulation of it. And this is

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:27.120
not to say anything negative about your thesis whatsoever. But one of the things I've noticed

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:33.360
is that that materialistic utopian vision, and I'm also not insulting Ridley or Lambert, who I

01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:38.880
admire greatly, that materialistic vision of incremental material progress has very little

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:47.360
motive power. It isn't an exciting story for some reason. What do we want? Incremental

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:54.000
improvement. When do we want it? In due time. It's not a gripping story. It's lacking something. And

01:22:54.960 --> 01:23:02.960
you seem to be pushing towards something that might be the medication for that lack.

01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:10.960
There's nothing in that vision that speaks of a grand destiny for the individual, for society.

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:17.520
And there are many religious traditions that insist that human beings exist in a relationship

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:24.640
with the divine, and that it's only in living out that relationship that life is imbued with

01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:31.200
the proper kind of meaning. And proper means sufficient to keep you from malevolence, I suppose,

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:37.120
and sufficient to be in love with life. Now, you posited in some of your statements a while back

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:45.520
that we're in this co-creation relationship with the divine. And that isn't too far off from my

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:53.040
understanding of many classical religious propositions that human beings participate in the

01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:58.080
act of creation. Whether we participate in the act of creating God is a whole different question,

01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:08.800
but we can leave that aside. So then the question is, what's the question that arises out of that?

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:16.480
I'm still trying to drive down at exactly what the main point you're making. You've worked on

01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:22.480
this book for a tremendous amount of time. Something's driving you hard. And it's the revelation of a

01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:28.400
solution to a very important problem. And the revelation seems to be something like an attempt

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:38.000
to explicate a higher-order vision, something that we can aspire to. And

01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:45.520
the drive to this is that I don't think that we live in an enlightened

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:53.440
era. We live in what David Bohm called an endarkened era, in which what we think is enlightening us is

01:24:53.440 --> 01:25:01.520
in fact inducing misery. The strange thing is that, unarguably, when people are enormously

01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:08.800
poverty-stricken, and of course one needs then to define what poverty is, are people who lead

01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:16.640
the lives that their ancestors have lived as hunter-gatherers. Are they poor? Or do they only

01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:21.600
become poor when their whole world is ripped apart and they're brought into the nearest large

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:27.440
industrial slum and have no bearings on the life, no relationship with the world, no pride,

01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:31.600
and their health suffers and they kill themselves. So what is poverty? That is a very

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:37.840
important question first. But also remedying poverty, extreme poverty, is of course enormously

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:47.600
important. No feeling person could argue against that. But it's not enough. One rather well-known

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:54.640
historical figure said, man cannot live by bread alone. And the thing is that there's only bread

01:25:54.640 --> 01:26:02.240
in this story. But that leaves out everything. Peter Cook, he plays the part of a publisher who

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:10.240
says, the trouble with your book is that it lacks everything. And I feel that this kind of philosophy

01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:15.120
lacks absolutely everything. It's got nothing whatever to offer. Now let me just put some

01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:21.040
facts to this because it may sound, you know, it's just my opinion. What do we know? Well,

01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:27.680
fortunately, going back to the 30s, school children in America in a certain system have

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:35.520
been asked the same questions about their happiness in life at the same age, going back now 70 years.

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:43.120
And Gene Twenge, who has looked at this data, which avoids all sorts of problems of defining

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:49.600
what you mean by happy and, you know, retrospector scopes and all the rest, you've got the data from

01:26:49.600 --> 01:27:01.680
the 1930s, the 40s, the 50s. And nowadays, the numbers of children that would qualify by a very

01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:10.320
well authenticated and commonly used standard as being depressed is five to eight times what it was

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:18.480
in the 1930s when poverty was a big issue. So five or eight times, not five or eight percent more.

01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:23.840
So there's something horrendous we're doing to ourselves. Suicide rates are going up,

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:29.200
particularly among women who register much greater dissatisfaction with life now than

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:35.040
they did 20 years ago, interestingly, because one might think that a number of things that

01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:39.920
would have made life hard for them have been removed. But it just shows how complicated it is

01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:46.320
knowing what works well for people. And three things overall, three things seem to be incredibly

01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:52.640
important for human fulfillment and happiness. And one of them I touched on at the end of the

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:59.040
master and his emissary, which is feeling socially connected, being bound into a meaningful community

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:07.280
of trust. That's one. The second is being in the presence of nature. Just going off for half an

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:13.280
hour into a forest and being quiet has an effect on your blood pressure, on your physical health,

01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:17.520
and so on. And these effects, if practiced, are greater than those in going to the gym.

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:24.560
And the thing that really struck me is there in Oxford, there is the Oxford Handbook of Religion,

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:31.360
I think it's called, but it looks at enormous bodies of evidence about the well-being of people who

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:38.320
are adherents to a religion and those who are not. And not only, as you very well might expect,

01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:46.080
the people who are not adherents to religion, much more prone to anxiety, depression, drug

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:53.040
addiction, they cope less well with crisis, they're more vulnerable generally. But

01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:59.520
they're actually physically not so well. So for example, rates of stroke, of heart disease,

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:07.120
are comparably better amongst the believing group than the unbelieving group,

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:13.520
with the difference between those who do cardio exercise for several hours a day.

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:20.640
And even smoking, it's a more powerful effect than smoking. Social connectedness is more

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:25.040
powerful than smoking. Being in nature, I think, is more powerful than smoking. And

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:35.600
being a part of a religious community that worships and even holding spiritual or religious views,

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:43.440
to some extent, is a mitigator against unhappiness and illness. So is that any answer to your question

01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:50.240
of why, you know, why I don't think that Matt Ridley's idea of it's totally left-handed idea,

01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:55.440
we just sort of crank out some more government departments, do some marvelous technical things

01:29:55.440 --> 01:30:00.640
and everybody gets to be living in a fantasy land of happiness. I don't believe this.

01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:04.960
Well, I don't think he believes that. I mean, he's a complicated person and

01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:12.240
he's more concerned with applying material resources where they could be most effectively

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:18.800
applied. I think the question of what material comfort and plenitude needs to be embedded in

01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:23.600
is a different question. I think it's reasonable to say, well, we should do what we can to alleviate

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:31.600
destitution and catastrophic poverty. We should improve child nutrition. We should eradicate

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:38.080
tuberculosis. Obviously, right. The question is, what does that have to be nested inside for it to

01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:46.720
be worthwhile? And so that's what you're aiming at. And I believe, what does that need to be

01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:51.360
nested in to make it worthwhile? And you've come to this conclusion, was this a shock to you over

01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:58.240
the years that you came to the conclusion that, okay, why not? I mean, the reason I'm asking is because

01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:06.160
it isn't an everyday occurrence, in some sense, for a committed scientist to point out that

01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:13.760
the scientific viewpoint needs to be embedded inside a broader, what, value oriented viewpoint?

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:18.160
It's something I believe, but it isn't an everyday occurrence for that to be stated forthrightly. And

01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:23.600
as a scientist, it isn't necessarily the first thing that would come to mind. Like, have you always

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:29.760
thought this way or have you come to this as a consequence of your thinking? Well, I have the

01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:37.520
advantage of having come to science from a fairly thorough grounding in the humanities. So I had a

01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:47.040
philosophy of life that was based on reading, thinking, talking. And I was a relatively

01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:55.280
aged customer when I started to study medicine, compared with most people who do that,

01:31:56.240 --> 01:32:04.720
at least in this country. So I brought a background which has always been my passion,

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:12.640
an interest in philosophy, but not just a kind of forever analytic philosophy in which you

01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:18.000
is more or less like sort of angels dancing on a pinhead and breaking everything down to

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:23.120
the tiniest parts. This doesn't really particularly interest me, but a kind of more human philosophy

01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:30.800
which doesn't become theology, but which is open to the idea that there is more

01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:38.240
in the world than we can know or understand. But it does sound like it is, that it has become

01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:44.160
theology. This isn't a critique. Like, it's an attempt to observe what you're telling me. It's

01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:51.520
not a critique at all. I'm trying to understand this. Well, it depends what you mean by theology.

01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:57.520
I don't think the most important part of a relationship with God is necessarily theology.

01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:07.280
I'm not disrespectful of theology, but I've read a lot of, for example,

01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:15.840
the Kabbalah. I've acquainted myself with Buddhist philosophy and I've always been very interested

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:23.600
in Taoism, Hinduism, and the deep wisdom of these things, including, as I say,

01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:30.960
North American native people and even circumpolar people. I mean, the wisdom is embodied in their

01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:38.000
mythologies. We think of these as somehow childish myths, but in fact, these myths contain, and in

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.720
fact, are the only way of containing or not containing because they're not ever contained,

01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:51.200
but of transmitting, bringing into being for other people the things that are the deep truths.

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:58.480
And it's that that motivated me. I'm not going to be alive much longer. I mean, I'm not in

01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:05.040
imminent danger of dying, but I mean, we're all actually here for an extraordinarily short time,

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:09.440
and there was great wisdom in the past in having a memento mori on your desk, a skull.

01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:17.040
And we're not here for very long. And it behaves us to behave and to understand the world in the

01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:22.000
most fruitful way for human fulfillment and happiness and for the greater fulfillment

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:28.800
of whatever it is that we sense in whatever is around us, in the being of the world. And,

01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:34.400
you know, the word cosmos keeps coming to mind, which also in its root means beautiful, because I

01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:40.080
think what one sees when one looks at the natural order is that it is as scientists and

01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:45.920
mathematicians are constantly saying it's outstandingly beautiful, complex and orderly.

01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:52.240
Why? Where does that come from? Well, I don't pretend to have an answer, but I see the difference

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:58.000
is between people who think they know the answer and people who don't. I'm one of the people who

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:03.120
don't think they know the answer. So please don't ask me what the answer is. I think I would disqualify

01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:08.800
myself from having anything worthwhile to say if I thought I had the answer. The difference in life

01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:19.040
is not between atheists on the one hand and believers on the other, but it's between fundamentalist

01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:25.040
believers and fundamentalist atheists on the one hand and people who often call themselves honest

01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:29.840
diagnostics on the other. That openness of mind, that willingness to acknowledge that one doesn't

01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:34.640
know everything, that one's reaching and searching for something is far more fruitful and spiritual

01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:38.560
to me than saying I know it, it's written down in this book and these are the rules.

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:48.160
The, I want to go back to the, I listen to all of that and I want to go back to the

01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:57.120
this co-creation idea, because that's not a trivial idea. That's an overwhelmingly

01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:07.680
massive idea. And it, see, I've, the audience, I've talked, the audiences I've talked with,

01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:18.960
I've talked about the necessity of a vision of life that's sufficiently demanding, meaningful

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:29.360
to justify the trouble of existence. And you, it seems to me that it's necessary psychologically

01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:37.440
to be in pursuit of a noble goal. And there isn't a goal that's more noble than the one that you

01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:47.920
outlined virtually by definition, right? I mean, if, if you're co-creating the cosmos, but also

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:55.200
if you're in a co-creating relationship with God, that involves you at the highest level of being,

01:36:55.200 --> 01:37:08.160
with the structure of being. Well, I, you know, again, because we're talking

01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:15.360
inevitably in shorthand because this is why this book is so colossally long. I mean,

01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:25.360
it's apparently as long as the Bible. The reason I had to do that is that I'm, what I'm doing is,

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:31.440
is nothing less than this. I'm saying the whole way in which you are taught by your education,

01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:39.840
by science, popular science, not by, you know, quantum physicists who have a very much more

01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:46.080
sophisticated grasp of philosophy, but by the sort of 19th century mechanism who still dominate

01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:55.120
biology unhappily, a version of some engineering, if you ever like. This is not a good way to think.

01:37:55.120 --> 01:38:05.520
This is not even likely to be true. It doesn't answer to any aspect of experience of the world,

01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:11.600
except the most tinnily detailed. So for example, what I think is that the whole structure of things

01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:17.760
is infinitely complex and has many recurring loops in it. And when you try, and it just an organism

01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:25.280
is like that, or even a cell, or even, you know, part of a cell, an organelle, is amazingly complex

01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:30.720
that the number of interactions, the number of chemical reactions that are going on there is

01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:38.160
colossal and they all have cascades that interact with one another. However, if you take from this

01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:44.480
very large picture right down to the tiniest, tiniest bit of light, you can see a little chain of

01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:48.960
arrows. This leads to that, leads to that. You can't see that all kinds of other things going on.

01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:54.000
And you can identify that. And that's what we're good at doing. And we say, if I interfere in that,

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:59.840
I can cause something to happen, which might be beneficial, for example, to somebody who has a

01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:06.240
health condition. So I'm not saying there's anything wrong with any of this. Again, I come back to

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:10.480
there's nothing wrong with the left hemisphere. There's only something wrong with it when it

01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:18.480
adopts the hubristic cloak of knowing everything. And when you said scientists are not often heard to

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:25.920
voice the sort of things that I'm saying and that you are saying, I'd like to say that physicists

01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:32.880
very often do, but that biologists relatively less often do now, although in the early part

01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:39.920
of the century, there were many great biologists such as J.B.S. Haldane, his father, John Scott Haldane,

01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:48.880
Conrad Havre, Wollington, Ludwig von Vettelansi in Austria, who saw a very sophisticated vision

01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:54.000
of the living world of biology. But what happened was, because there were great

01:39:55.040 --> 01:40:02.160
successes in molecular engineering after the war, this vision, which as I say is technically

01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:07.360
correct, that you can interfere as a detail and do something very valuable. But the mistake is to

01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:12.720
extrapolate from that, to say this is the structure of the whole thing we're looking at. It's not,

01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:18.480
it's not like that. The least eight or nine ways in which an living being is not like a machine.

01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:24.720
So I am sorry that scientists diminish themselves by adopting this very narrow vision

01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:29.760
of what life is. Because after all, the whole point of science as Schrodinger said

01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:33.760
is to answer the question, who are we? And if it's not answering that question, and it's not

01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:40.320
assumable into an answer to that question, it's not really getting us to what the meaning of our

01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:46.160
life demands from us. That we have not an answer to the question, who are we? Not an answer to the

01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:51.520
question, what is the meaning of life? Of course, by definition, there isn't one. But the very knowledge

01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:57.840
that we have to strive for it and not lose sight of it is very, very important. There's a saying in

01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:05.040
the Midrash, you are, you're not obliged to finish the work, but you are not permitted to cease from

01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:11.200
it. And I think that is, I mean, I would say that is my vision of what I do. I think it's what all

01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:17.520
seekers after truth have to do, whether they're philosophers or scientists. And you know, I

01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:24.880
would love science to be more scientific. The curious thing is I honor science deeply. And I

01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:31.680
think that it has nothing to lose by making, you know, being a little bit humbler than it is by

01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:37.360
accepting that there was a lot that is deeply puzzling and that the more we know about physics,

01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:42.880
for example, the more we understand what we don't know. And it's not scientific to rule out certain

01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:49.920
ways of thinking to say that thinking in terms of organic holes in terms of gestalt, gestalt and so

01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:55.920
forth is somehow not scientific. No, it's just not the way that a certain very narrow form of

01:41:55.920 --> 01:42:02.800
sciences practice. And I want science before I die to become more open as science should be,

01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:08.560
to be more questing, more imaginative. You know, in writing this book, I've had a lot to do with

01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:14.640
the story of how scientists made their discoveries, how mathematicians made their discoveries. And

01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:19.200
they very rarely, if ever, as George Gaylord Simpson himself said, you know, one of the great

01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:26.080
mainstream molecular biologists of the last century, it's very rare that they make them by

01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:30.800
following the scientific method. The scientific method is a retrospective thing that is fitted

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:37.600
on to what actually happens, which is extraordinary insights of intuition, seeing shapes, testing

01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:43.440
them out, of course, which is a scientific method, of course. But it's not this kind of boring,

01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:46.960
rule-bound thing that it's often made out to be.

01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:53.360
Well, I think with that statement, that's a good place to end for today.

01:42:55.200 --> 01:43:02.720
It was a nice conclusion, gone for an hour and a half or so. And I appreciate...

01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:03.360
It's all right with me.

01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:09.840
Very much you talking with me. Hopefully we can do this again. I want to get further through your

01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:16.400
book. I'll keep everybody posted as to the progress of the book and to where they can obtain it

01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:22.160
when that becomes possible. Is there anything else that you wanted to mention today

01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:25.360
that you want to bring up before we close?

01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:32.640
Well, no. I mean, I want to say first of all, which I haven't really had an opportunity to say,

01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:40.080
how enormously glad I am that you are back in debate with us all. And long may that be.

01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:47.760
And I do... I think the conversations we have are good. I hope other people may think that too.

01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:51.120
Well, we're going to put that to the test.

01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:57.680
And I'd like to just draw people's attention to the fact that in the last six months,

01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:03.600
it is six months, I think, six or seven months, we've developed something called Channel McGilchrist,

01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:09.280
which is a place on the internet where you can find out more about my stuff. You can see

01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:17.200
talks, lectures, podcasts, things I've done, what I'm... And generally keep up to date. There's a

01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:22.960
forum there where you can enter into and discuss my work. There's a place where you can ask questions

01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:29.680
off me. So once a month, I answer four questions out of a list of things that members of the...

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:33.200
Because you can either be a non-member or a member. But if you're a member, you can ask me

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:39.360
a question, which I will then spend a quarter of an hour answering. So that's my attempt to try and

01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:44.640
give back something that isn't just the odd book every 10 years. So...

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.760
Well, we'll make sure that we put the links and all of that in the description of this video.

01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:54.960
And with any luck, we'll get a chance to talk again in the future after we've both digested this

01:44:55.760 --> 01:45:01.360
and this conversation. It was really good to see you again.

01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:04.960
Oh, and you. Thank you.
