0	6420	It's the Hebrews created history as we know it.
6420	10500	You don't get away with anything and so you might think you can bend the fabric of reality
10500	14500	and that you can treat people instrumentally and that you can bow to the tyrant and violate
14500	16120	your conscience without cost.
16120	17420	You will pay the piper.
17420	22100	It's going to call you out of that slavery into freedom even if that pulls you into the
22100	23100	desert.
24100	30700	And we're going to see that there's something else going on here that is far more cosmic
30700	33180	and deeper than what you can imagine.
33180	41460	The highest ethical spirit to which we're beholden is presented precisely as that spirit
41460	45940	that allies itself with the cause of freedom against tyranny.
45940	46940	Yes, exactly.
46940	48460	I want villains to get punished.
48460	52140	But do you want the villains to learn before they have to pay the ultimate price?
52140	54140	That's such a Christian question.
65140	68500	One of the reasons why I started working on the equipment is the way cattle were being
68500	70660	handled was horrible.
70660	74380	Electric prods on 100 percent of them falling down and crashing into things, people screaming
74380	76140	at them.
76140	79820	Cattle handling in the 80s was terrible, absolutely terrible.
79820	83740	And I saw that as something that I could fix.
83740	88220	Now I talked to a lot of young people today that want to do activism about some specific
88220	90580	thing and it's way too broad.
90580	92700	I want justice in the world, for example.
92700	93700	Right, yes, yes.
93700	94700	It might be something they would say.
94700	95700	Yes, yes.
95700	100060	And I say, why don't you do something more targeted, like using DNA to show that this
100060	103100	prisoner was falsely accused?
103100	107700	You see, now that's something a lot more targeted that you can actually do.
107700	109500	Yes, absolutely.
109500	114020	I think that is a huge problem with the way that kids are trained morally in universities
114020	122060	is that that grandiose, vague activism replaces the actual practicalities of problem-solving
122060	124260	that you're describing that actually make a difference.
124260	138700	Hello, everyone.
138700	145820	I'm usually excited to have whoever I'm talking to that day on my show because I pick people
145820	147060	I'm excited about talking to.
147060	152020	But I'm particularly excited about my guest today, Dr. Temple Grandin.
152140	157740	Temple Grandin revolutionized the animal handling industry over the last 40 years and has done
157740	163340	more for animal welfare in a practical sense than anybody that I know of and perhaps anybody
163340	164340	on the planet.
164340	165900	I think you could make a case for that.
165900	166900	She's a remarkable person.
166900	168660	I saw her first in Tucson, Arizona.
168660	171300	I'll talk about that a little bit in our interview.
171300	175540	She gave one of the most compelling presentations I'd ever seen in an academic setting at a
175540	179460	conference on consciousness and saw that about 15 years ago.
179460	184020	And ever since then, I'd really been wanting to meet her and I got to do that today, so
184020	185340	that's so exciting.
185340	188620	So I'll just give you a brief bio and we'll pop into the interview.
188620	195140	Dr. Temple Grandin is a professor of animal sciences at Colorado State University.
195140	199620	Facilities she has designed for handling livestock are used by companies all around the world.
199620	205020	Her work has been instrumental in implementing animal welfare auditing programs, now used
205020	209900	by McDonald's, Wendy's, Whole Foods, and many other major corporations.
209900	215380	She has appeared on numerous shows across platforms such as 2020 Larry King Live and
215380	216380	Prime Time.
216380	222580	Dr. Grandin is also an accomplished author with books such as Thinking in Pictures,
222580	226700	Livestock Handling in Transport, and The Autistic Brain.
226700	232940	A few of her other publications, Animals in Translation, as well as Visual Thinking,
232940	235900	have even made it to the New York Times bestseller list.
235900	242460	In 2017, Dr. Grandin was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame, and in 2022,
242460	246540	she was honored once again as a Colorado State Distinguished Professor.
246540	254380	We're going to walk through her book today and we're going to learn what she has to
254380	257380	say now about thinking.
257380	259380	Let's start with Visual Thinking and Language.
259380	265900	So do you want to tell people about your realization and about different thought patterns?
265900	271780	When I was in my 20s, I thought everybody thought in pictures the way I thought.
271780	277180	I didn't know that other people thought in words until I was in my late 30s.
277180	279700	Now you've already mentioned how do I categorize?
279700	287660	Well, I explain as a child how I learned to categorize, categorizing with individual pictures.
287660	294820	So as a very young child, I categorized cats, dogs, and horses by size because in our neighborhood
294820	299300	at that time, there were no cattle and there were no small dogs.
299300	305940	Then a doxxant came into my neighborhood and she's the same size as a cat.
305940	310540	And I remember looking at the doxxant, she was a black doxxant, and trying to figure
310540	316300	out now what features does she share with the dog she barks.
316300	322140	Her nose shape is the same as a dog and she smells like a dog.
322140	329060	So I had to take other sensory-based things like smell and what the dog sounded like to
329060	333500	put the doxxant in the dog category.
333500	336060	So the way I formed categories is I have to have a bunch of information.
336060	343780	Let's take the cat category and you look at a leopard's face, a lion's face, and even
343780	351740	a house cat's face, there's similarities and they also smell all the same too.
351740	355980	If you go to the zoo, you can smell how they are different.
355980	362020	So the first step for abstract thinking is put making categories.
362020	369100	So when I finally figured out that other people did not think in pictures, if I asked most
369100	373860	people, visualize your own home, your dog, or your car, you will do it because you're
373860	376780	so familiar with that.
376780	381900	But one time at an autism conference, when I was in my late 30s, I asked a speech therapist
381900	387940	think about a church staple and I was shocked that all the only image she saw was a very
387940	394020	vague two lines like this, where I see specific churches.
394020	401260	They come up like a series of back then 35 millimeter slides, now the PowerPoint slides.
401260	406020	And then I can start as I see more and more of these churches, I can put them into New
406020	410740	England type category, stone cathedral type.
410740	415380	Looks like a warehouse and it has a little plastic steeple type.
415380	421220	I can make finer categories as I get more and more specific images.
421220	425860	It's bottom-up thinking and I learned that that's exactly how an artificial intelligence
425860	429620	program diagnosis melanoma cancer.
429620	434540	It's given a training set of 2,000 melanomas and another training set of every kind of
434540	439180	skin rash and mosquito bite and infected whatever.
439180	444020	And then it learns to categorize melanoma from non-melanoma.
444020	448980	And that was very insightful to me when I learned that that's how the simple type of
449060	455380	artificial intelligence programs work, diagnosing something like melanoma.
455380	461500	So let me ask you, when I'm thinking something through, now I can think in pictures and if
461500	466980	I'm building something or trying to design something to build, then I tend to think in
466980	467980	pictures.
467980	475980	But I would say 90% of the time my proclivity is to think in words and I would say in part
475980	483980	that's because my word thinking is so dominant, it just suppresses the image thinking.
483980	489540	And so a lot of my thinking, I would also say, takes the form of something like internal
489540	491540	argumentation.
491540	497820	So I'll ask myself a question, I'll think up an answer in words and then I'll think
497820	502740	up a bunch of reasons why that answer isn't sufficient and then I'll conduct an internal
502740	503740	argument.
503740	509060	And that's occupying me continually, like 16 hours a day non-stop.
509060	514180	And it's been like that ever since I was two years old, except for those times, let's say.
514180	524100	So yeah, so how do you conduct internal arguments or what accounts for the...
524100	528020	So part of the creativity in my thinking is the outcome of these arguments.
528020	533940	What you're thinking in pictures, so you're not having internal arguments, what's the
533940	535820	stream of your thought like?
535820	542260	Well, when it comes to things like designing equipment, I often will kind of, a lot of
542260	545820	equipment design, someone gets an idea from something else.
545820	550780	And one of my other books I wrote about the inventor of Velcro and he saw how Burdock
550780	556740	stuck on his clothes, cockled birds on those kind of things stuck on his clothes.
556740	560260	And that's where he got the idea for making Velcro.
560260	563060	That would be visual thinking.
563060	569620	The Burdocks and Velcro, they've got similarities on how they stick together.
569620	573900	In designing equipment, I can just see how it operates.
573900	580220	I worked with welders that had 20 patents each that barely graduated from high school,
580220	585460	but they could build any kind of a machine and invent industrial machinery.
585460	588700	They just see it in their head.
588700	595020	Right now, will you see, okay, so I read Nikolai Tesla's biography a long while back and it
595020	601660	was extremely interesting and he claimed, and I have no reason to disbelieve him, that
601660	609560	entire inventions, machines would pop into the theater of his imagination, detailed out
609560	614580	to the point where he knew the angles on the screws that held the metal together.
614580	620020	And he would try to write them down in something, draw them out in something approximating,
620020	625580	something that you could make a blueprint out of, let's say, in that much detail.
625580	630460	And sometimes a new invention would pop into his head so quickly that it would obliterate
630460	632100	the previous one.
632100	634460	He had to work very quickly to keep up.
634460	639620	And so there's that incredible fluency in visualization.
639620	646660	But then, as I said, in the verbal world, I'll think of an argument and counterarguments.
646660	652780	When you're thinking of industrial design, do you think of the object that you're attempting
652780	657020	to design and then multiple variants of it and test them against each other, or does
657020	661140	it just come to you as a solution for a given problem?
661140	664500	It almost sort of just pops into my head.
664500	666260	I also see mechanical abnormalities.
666460	670540	I remember walking in and someone had made a cardboard, old-fashioned locomotive.
670540	676540	The wheels have those links between them, and I go, they drew that wrong.
676540	677540	Wheels are not going to turn.
677540	683180	It was just a cartoon train for a party.
683180	686300	But I immediately noticed that they didn't draw it right.
686300	691300	The other thing is, is my thinking is associative.
691300	693100	All right.
693100	697740	Give me a key word, pretend I'm Google for images.
697740	704300	Not something I can see in here with books and papers all around and photography equipment
704300	708540	and stuff all around me, but something kind of a creative key word.
708540	716580	And I'll tell you how I access my memory for that key word.
716580	719820	Start the new year off right with black rifle coffee.

767180	772660	So and with regard, so my wife has a very powerful visual imagination.
772660	777540	She's able to do all sorts of remarkable things with it.
777540	783860	And one of the things that strikes me as highly probable is that her capacity for visual imagery
783860	786540	is a lot more intense than mine.
786540	793260	And so like I was a fairly vivid dreamer for years, especially when I was reading Carl
793260	795540	Jung's work in graduate school.
795540	799860	Don't seem to dream much now or not, well, I don't remember them much now.
799860	805900	When I do think in pictures, it's not as vivid as seeing the real world.
805900	808580	It's maybe 5% of that.
808580	814100	It's sort of, it's, it's, well, it just doesn't have that intensity.
814100	815780	What about, and you, and you?
815780	818580	Oh no, it's very, very vivid.
818580	824420	And, and while I was, while you were setting up all the camera equipment, here I found on
824420	826020	here's a whole bunch of papers.
826020	831260	More papers I've found online supporting the, a lot of the things that are in the book.
831260	836500	I just got surfing around and boy, you can sometimes find some great stuff when you look
836500	837500	at the citations.
837500	839500	No, but it's very, very vivid.
839500	842940	I don't know, it's, it's completely vivid.
842940	848700	Now when you mentioned the word imagination, I remember going to a long time ago, Disney
848700	855100	World, a kind of a ride that had imagination with people and dirigibles and things like
855180	856180	that.
856180	861100	You know, then I visited a studio where they, where Disney made a whole bunch of their stuff.
861100	862100	I'm now seeing that.
862100	864580	Yes, I'm now seeing a non-disclosure agreement.
864580	867740	So I can't tell you what I did there.
867740	876580	And I, but I, now I'm seeing a very interesting discussion we had about designing things where,
876580	880820	where you're designing things, there's the decoration part of it.
880820	884340	And then there's, then there's a mechanical part of, of a machine.
884460	889020	Of course, at an amusement park, you want to have decorations, but you also, the rides
889020	890660	have to mechanically work.
890660	895980	They're kind of two separate things that were kind of done by two separate departments.
895980	902500	You also spoke in your book about your ability to see things out of place.
902500	909780	And so one of the things that characterizes autism is the fact that at least some autistic
909780	915700	people are not very happy when they walk into a room, say that they're familiar with
915700	917500	and one thing is out of place.
917500	923420	So for example, an autistic child might walk into a dining room and one of the chairs is,
923420	927420	you know, tilted 45 degrees to the right or to the left instead of being put straight
927420	928420	in.
928420	934140	And what seems to happen, correct me if, if you feel that I'm wrong, is that the fact
934140	941100	that that chair is now askew means that the entire room is different in some important
941100	943100	and emotionally significant way.
943100	945220	So there's this response to anomaly.
945220	946700	I don't have that issue.
946700	953500	That's not an issue for me, but if there's one pixel off on an electronic sign, I will
953500	954500	notice that.
954500	961340	I remember one time walking into the airport with somebody else and the United Ticket Counter
961340	965340	sign was a whole row of television monitors.
965340	970220	And there must have been 20 TV monitors making the word United over and over again.
970220	973900	And one of the screens was scrambled, the whole screen.
973900	977900	And I immediately saw it and I said to the person beside me, did you see that that sign
977900	979180	was messed up?
979180	981420	No, they did not see it.
981420	984260	They were right beside me when we walked in.
984260	985460	I immediately saw it.
985460	989660	Now that it upset me, no, I just noticed that the sign was scrambled.
989660	990660	Right.
990660	991780	But it didn't upset you.
991780	992780	No.
992780	996300	So yeah, so that's that interesting.
996300	1001700	So for me, I think I can detect anomalies visually.
1001700	1007300	So for example, one of the things I learned to do when I was setting up my house and renovating
1007300	1013180	places and setting up my offices, like arranging my local environment, was to sit in the room
1013180	1016940	and become meditative in some sense.
1016940	1024460	And then to feel out what was bothering me about the room, like what ugly feature might
1024460	1028060	pop out, what part of it needed to be attended to.
1028060	1029060	Right.
1029060	1035820	And I think I was tuning myself to detect what was abnormal in relationship to the underlying
1035820	1039140	aesthetic or the pattern of the room.
1039140	1044020	But that pops out for you almost instantaneously.
1044020	1046300	For me, anomaly detection is mostly verbal.
1046300	1051500	Again, it's like all think up an argument and then think up counter arguments.
1051500	1057580	And if one argument and the other don't jive, if they're contradictory, then that pops out
1057580	1058580	for me.
1058580	1065020	Well, it's sort of like I fly all the time to like I know when the pilots do the checklist.
1065020	1071300	And like we push back, and we just take too long to turn, I'm going, uh-oh, we're going
1071300	1073700	to have an air traffic control delay.
1073700	1079940	And I can often predict that before they announce it.
1079940	1086220	And I also can, I'm very conscious of on the biggest airplane, when they start the little
1086220	1089820	gentle push to push it back from the gate, I can feel it on the biggest aircraft there
1089820	1090820	is.
1090820	1091820	Right.
1091820	1100940	And I just want to get there and I'm going, oh, please push back.
1100940	1103700	But it's sort of like I don't get upset about it.
1103700	1107140	It's just anything that's not routine.
1107140	1112580	I instantly notice it and I go, oh, crap, I see a vest that says tech ops.
1112580	1115180	We may have a delayed flight.
1115180	1117900	Now that brings up another thing I want to talk about.
1117900	1123620	In the last month, I've had, okay, a mechanic come on a plane twice and both mechanics had
1123620	1125060	gray hair.
1125060	1131580	And this brings up a major issue that's in my book about skill loss, especially skill
1131580	1134380	loss with mechanical things.
1134380	1140100	I've been on a lot of questionable elevators and escalators lately that definitely needed
1140100	1142300	servicing.
1142300	1146980	And what's happening, and this is in my screened out chapter, is the kids are getting screened
1146980	1151700	out of these trades because they've taken the shop classes out of the schools 20 years
1151700	1157060	ago and we have so many higher math requirements that you don't need for something like fixing
1157060	1162820	elevators that the kids are playing video games in the basement on an autism diagnosis
1162820	1165060	instead of fixing elevators.
1165060	1169940	There's a relationship here between what goes on with industrial things and what's going
1169940	1175540	on at school, which is a major, major thing that I'm interested in talking about.
1176260	1179380	Yeah, so let's talk about that a little bit.
1179380	1183260	That's one of the things that popped out for me from your book.
1183260	1185860	So I was trying to think that through.
1185860	1191220	So you make the claim as you just laid out that our education system and maybe our entire
1191220	1199100	culture as it's hypothetically deindustrializing is actually working against the best interests
1199100	1204460	of those who think mechanically, those who think in pictures, and those who can do hands
1204580	1205580	on work.
1205580	1211700	And here's a paper I just dug off of Google Scholar on visual objectability, a new dimension
1211700	1213780	of nonverbal intelligence.
1213780	1220340	And what a lot of educators don't understand is that object visualization, especially on
1220340	1225220	solving mechanical problems, it is a different way of thinking.
1225220	1229540	I worked with people that barely graduated from high school, stutterers.
1229540	1231060	They'd be labeled autistic to date.
1231060	1237100	They'd be in special ed, but they had big metal working shops and 20 patents each for
1237100	1241580	mechanically complicated equipment that they are selling around the world.
1241580	1247180	And this is something that educators just don't get it.
1247180	1253260	And the reason why I wrote this book, I'll tell you what was the reason.
1253260	1260420	In 2019, just before COVID shut everything down, I went to four places and I realized
1260420	1263340	the magnitude of the skill loss.
1263340	1269900	The first one was a pork processing plant where most of the equipment came from Holland.
1269900	1274140	I went to another pork processing plant, equipment coming from Holland.
1274140	1278180	Then I went to a poultry processing plant where all of the specialized equipment came
1278180	1281500	from Holland, 100 shipping containers.
1281500	1286780	And then I went to the Steep Jobs Theater and the structural glass walls are from Italy
1286780	1287780	and Germany.
1287780	1293620	Then, after reading more stuff, I found out that the state-of-the-art electronic chip-making
1293620	1296420	machine comes from Holland.
1296420	1300380	And that goes back to their educational system.
1300380	1304740	They don't stick their nose up at the high-end skilled trades and look at it sort of like
1304740	1307060	a lesser form of intelligence.
1307060	1312380	When the kids get to about ninth grade, they can go university route or they can go tech
1312380	1313380	route.
1313380	1318740	They're going to emphasize high-end skilled trades where you're really using that visual
1318740	1323100	thinking for mechanical devices.
1323100	1327260	So I was trying to think through why this might be happening.
1327260	1332020	So let me offer some hypotheses to you and you tell me what you think about this.
1332020	1339600	So first of all, we have learned and you draw on Simon Baron Cohen's work in your book.
1339600	1345800	We have learned that there is a difference and we can try to map this on to verbal thinking
1345800	1348560	versus imagistic thinking.
1348560	1356560	Simon Baron Cohen talked about systemizing versus empathizing and he considers that something
1356560	1362160	akin to the continuum between autistic thinking and normal thinking.
1362160	1369240	So the autistic types are more systematizing and my suspicions are they're also the ones
1369280	1372520	who are more likely to think in images in the manner that you described.
1372520	1373520	Wait a minute.
1373520	1378400	Now we've got two kinds of thinking in images.
1378400	1382680	And there's a nice paper that just came out relatively recently, seeing and thinking in
1382680	1388800	pictures, a review of visual information processing that came out in 2018, I'd like to keep my
1388800	1390680	stuff up to date.
1390680	1397400	Now I think in photorealistic pictures where the more mathematical type of thinking thinks
1397440	1399480	in patterns.
1399480	1402960	See in your brain you've got circuits for what is something.
1402960	1406320	OK, so I see a dog and I go, yeah, that's a dog.
1406320	1412760	Or I've got some china ceramic cattle on my coffee table here.
1412760	1416200	OK, and I just look at the animals and name them.
1416200	1419640	Then the visual spatial is where is something?
1419640	1422560	Where are you located in space?
1422560	1426600	There are actually two different kinds of visualization.
1426640	1434240	And I have a whole chapter in visual thinking book about this and research to back this up.
1434240	1441400	Now the visual spatial type pattern thinking or sort of where is something in space, those
1441400	1444800	kids do well in math, so they're going to stem right.
1444800	1448360	But let me tell you what's going on out in the food processing plants.
1448360	1452400	The people I've worked with in the big steel shops now that a lot of us closed down, we
1452400	1458000	are paying the price now for taking out the shop classes on designed mechanically clever
1458000	1459600	equipment.
1459600	1463400	The people I've worked with in May, we never worked on boilers or refrigeration, we don't
1463400	1465320	understand that stuff.
1465320	1471440	That requires a lot more mathematical thinking or this load on the roof so the factory doesn't
1471440	1474080	fall down if we get two feet of snow.
1474080	1478400	You see then I have seen this division of engineering labor in every single meat company
1478400	1479400	I have worked with.
1479400	1480400	They're all the same.
1480400	1487760	So do you think that's a matter of like let's say something approximating focal depth?
1487760	1496600	So is it possible that the first kind of people that you talked about are dealing at the object
1496600	1497600	level itself?
1497600	1501600	So they're dealing say with a boiler or with a particular piece of equipment whereas the
1501600	1505400	other types are dealing with the relationship between pieces of equipment?
1505400	1507400	No, you don't think that's it?
1507400	1509400	No, I think it's just real simple.
1509400	1515160	You just see the objects and then after you work, you see an object visualizer gets better
1515160	1520000	and better at designing mechanical equipment, the more things you go out and see.
1520000	1524000	When I started working my designing cattle handling facilities, I went to every feed yard
1524000	1529880	in Arizona and I worked cattle and I go this kind of a design doesn't work, this worked
1529880	1533040	so then I took all the good bits and like recombined them.
1533040	1534240	It's bottom up thinking.
1534240	1538920	The more stuff I get exposed to, okay, whether it's cattle handling facility or maybe I'll
1538960	1543160	look at how water flows through something and then you watch how cattle move.
1543160	1551160	I'd like to look at drone footage and a lot of that resembles water flow and the visual
1551160	1554600	spatial, they see patterns.
1554600	1563160	It's actually very different and what we're losing is the object visualizer.
1563160	1568000	That person that can just, you see, I'm very aware of things like I go in an elevator now
1568080	1571400	that hasn't been serviced and it's scraping in the shaft, you better believe it.
1571400	1576080	I hear it and I go, they haven't serviced that elevator.
1576080	1582040	I was at a fancy hotel recently and the bell hop goes, oh, it skips that floor.
1582040	1584120	We have to get that floor on the way down.
1584120	1587360	Yeah, real nice hotel, major city.
1587360	1589120	Right, right.
1589120	1593520	Okay, so let me, I don't quite understand that distinction yet so I'm going to, I'm
1593520	1595080	going to push a little bit more on that.
1595080	1602520	So on the visual side, you have the visual spatial types, if I'm remembering this correctly,
1602520	1604680	and that's the category that you fall into.
1604680	1608640	And then you have people who are, what are they, higher up on the abstraction chain in
1608640	1611240	some sense, the ones who can think more mathematically?
1611240	1615840	No, but basically, object visualizers, I can tell you this from experience, we're good
1615840	1619360	at mechanical devices, art, photography.
1619360	1624920	I have talked to many, many photographers because I do a lot of interviews, find out
1624920	1629200	they're dyslexic, they're about flunked out of school, and fortunately somebody introduced
1629200	1630560	them to photography.
1630560	1633920	And the other thing that my kind of mind's good at is animals.
1633920	1638320	Then your visual spatial, mathematics, algebra, I can't do algebra.
1638320	1640480	There's nothing there to visualize.
1640480	1645080	Mathematics, calculus, I took a computer programming course when I was in college.
1645080	1647120	I couldn't do it, I had to drop it.
1647120	1651840	I was exposed to the same exact computer that Bill Gates had, and he could do it and I had
1651840	1655000	to drop the class.
1655000	1661040	These are the things that the more mathematical pattern thinking mind is good at.
1661040	1665440	And some of these really smart kids, they can just look at algebra formulas and just see
1665440	1666440	it.
1666440	1668400	They don't have to do it step by step, they just see it.
1668400	1672080	And that's how they think, and then the teachers try to make them do it step by step.
1672080	1674240	That gets the kids frustrated.
1674240	1676120	They don't think the same way.
1676760	1681400	And so my thinking is also associative, I tend to jump around.
1681400	1684600	But there's a logic to the association.
1684600	1688680	And I think the best way to illustrate that associative kind of thinking is give me a
1688680	1694560	single keyword, like I'm Google for images, and think of a creative keyword.
1694560	1700840	And I will tell you exactly how my mind associates and how my mind can get off the subject, but
1700840	1704760	there is a logic to the getting off of the subject.
1704760	1707360	So give me a keyword, a single keyword.
1707360	1710000	Okay, how about rows?
1710000	1716480	Okay, I'm seeing rows bushes that we had in our backyard when I was a child.
1716480	1719680	And we had a lot of thorns on them.
1719680	1722200	And we also like to dig around in the grass that was back there.
1722200	1729360	So now I'm seeing the grass behind our house, we used to go play in it and catch some insects
1729360	1730360	sometimes.
1730360	1733600	Okay, now you can see how it's jumping around.
1733600	1739160	I don't have that big a visual library of roses.
1739160	1744640	So then I tend to then go to something else.
1744640	1746720	But how about cows?
1746720	1747720	What?
1747720	1748720	Cows.
1748720	1754960	All right, now I'm seeing like 10 cow statues right here in front of me.
1754960	1759080	And so obviously those are coming up in my mind.
1759080	1761360	Just recently, I tend to bring up recent memories.
1761360	1767000	I visited with a black Angus bull, it was a pet, and he wasn't very happy with us because
1767000	1768920	we didn't bring him any carrots.
1768920	1774800	So my friend gave him one of those disgusting soy protein bars and he goes, not going to
1774800	1775800	eat that.
1775800	1779280	I wouldn't eat it, no matter how much we tried to feed it to him.
1779280	1783560	And he was annoyed because we didn't bring him any carrots.
1784560	1789400	Okay, now I've got the carrot word in my head.
1789400	1794640	And when I was in fourth grade, I used my singer Sohandi to sew green crepe paper so
1794640	1796360	students could be carrots.
1796360	1801360	And I made the green carrot tops out of green crepe paper.
1801360	1804720	So that's how I got the cattle to carrot.
1804720	1811200	So talking to you that way reminds me very much of what used to happen in my therapy
1811200	1815320	sessions when I was helping people interpret their dreams.
1815320	1822720	And so dreams have the same quality of thought that your thought had when you just put it
1822720	1823920	on display there.
1823920	1827560	So because the dream tends to be an intermingling.
1827560	1833560	So imagine there's a center category and the nature of the category is somewhat unclear.
1833560	1836360	Maybe that's partly what the dream is trying to puzzle out.
1836440	1842080	What you get is a web of associations, some of which are autobiographical, that are sort
1842080	1844760	of circulating around a main theme.
1844760	1849960	And partly what you do when you analyze a dream is you walk through all the associated
1849960	1850960	images.
1850960	1856840	You also ask the person to let their mind loose to generate more associations.
1856840	1862560	And then you try to use the associational web to triangulate on the central theme and
1862560	1863920	to haul out the gist.
1863920	1869000	And the gist of that array of images would be something like the interpretation of the
1869000	1870000	dream.
1870000	1872040	If you get it right, then it snaps into people.
1872040	1875640	They think, oh yes, that's definitely what that was about.
1875640	1881240	But the dream is attempting to put something together that has a central category of structure.
1881240	1886960	Well, now there also are sensory things because I have some balance issues.
1886960	1891400	So I often get dreams where I'm riding a bike down a hill that's super steep like that.
1891400	1893520	And I wish I wasn't doing that.
1893520	1897280	And I know that that has to do with the fact that I have balance issues.
1897280	1901920	I don't think it means anything, but I'm always up on some high place that I wish I wasn't
1901920	1905960	up on and I've got to try to walk down it.
1905960	1910280	And then I have other dreams where I can see it might have some meaning and other times
1910280	1913280	of where it doesn't.
1913280	1918320	But the other thing with my thinking, when I'm working on design work, I can control
1918320	1920560	the associations.
1920560	1922480	I can control them.
1922480	1926520	I've had before, there's now 3D simulations.
1926520	1931640	Okay, let's say the company that's building this plant wants to show off how the equipment
1931640	1932640	works.
1932640	1936920	They can do a 3D simulation showing how the equipment works.
1936920	1940320	I can remember sitting in a conference room when we were trying to discuss how to do some
1940320	1943440	conveyors.
1943440	1946680	And the other guys there are coming up with ideas for the conveyors and going, no, no,
1946680	1949320	if you do that, you're going to yank the rails out of the ceiling.
1949320	1951520	Oh, no, no, no, that won't work.
1951520	1957480	They were almost using my mind like a 3D CAD program that was animated.
1957480	1962480	And I could test run in my head on these different conveyors.
1962480	1966880	Men, is it time to stop mindless scrolling?
1966880	1970480	Time to finally gain that higher quality of life you know you're missing out on?
1970480	1975320	If this sounds familiar, then on January 9th, join thousands of men all over the world to
1975320	1979520	embark on a 90 day journey together in search of a better life.
1979520	1983440	It's called Exodus 90 and it was built to help men enjoy the freedom of becoming who
1983440	1985440	they were truly made to be.
1985440	1990360	Exodus 90 guides you in removing the attachments that are holding you back from a better life.
1990360	1992680	And it actually works.
1992680	1997000	Independent research shows that Exodus 90 men report considerable shifts after the first
1997000	2001440	90 days, including stronger satisfaction rates in their marriages, more meaningful prayer
2001440	2005680	lives, and dramatic decreases in time spent on their phones.
2005680	2010360	For the past seven years, Exodus has helped more than 60,000 men build a roadmap for living
2010360	2015320	with virtue in a culture that offers far too many paths to self-destruction.
2015320	2017280	Is it time for your Exodus?
2017280	2019200	We start January 9th.
2019200	2023880	Find resources to prepare for Exodus at Exodus90.com slash Jordan.
2023880	2030280	That's Exodus90.com slash Jordan.
2030280	2035400	So let's go back to the issue of, say, taking sharp class out of school.
2035400	2040040	So Baron Cohen talked about systematizers versus empathizers.
2040040	2045280	Yeah, but what Baron Cohen did, he left out the object visualizers.
2045280	2050160	He was looking more at the mathematical visualization pattern thinkers.
2050160	2057960	I agree with him about systematizing and verbal, but the object visualizer.
2057960	2059240	But he didn't differentiate.
2059240	2061960	He didn't differentiate the systematizers properly.
2061960	2062960	That should be more differentiated.
2062960	2063960	Yeah, he didn't.
2063960	2069080	The systematizers would have two categories, the object visualizer and the visual spatial.
2069080	2073600	And a big mistake in a lot of perceptual studies is that they're not differentiating them.
2073600	2079040	And some people, there's some verbal people in psychology that don't want to believe this
2079040	2080040	stuff exists.
2080040	2086480	Just while you were setting up the cameras, I downloaded six new abstracts that aren't
2086480	2091760	even in my book on this that show that they are different.
2091760	2092760	Right.
2092760	2095640	Got them right here on my lap.
2095640	2100760	So Cohen also talks about gender differences in relationship to this continuum.
2100760	2104080	So we can break the continuum into two parts on the one end.
2104080	2111160	And it is the case that autism tends to be preferentially a male disorder, although there
2111160	2112800	are females as well.
2112800	2118120	But so that systematizing mode of thinking that you've differentiated into the two categories
2118120	2122800	also tends to be gender stereotype to some degree at a biological level.
2122800	2128560	I avoid that issue as controversial because right now, I'm interested in one thing at
2128560	2133960	the age of 75 of helping the students who think differently get into really good careers
2133960	2136920	where they can have satisfying lives.
2136920	2139360	And I avoid the controversial stuff.
2139800	2143280	Yeah, well, I'm not so much interested in the controversy.
2143280	2149160	I'm interested in trying to address the issue of why shop courses, for example, have been
2149160	2150800	taken out of schools.
2150800	2157120	Now we do know that schools are predominantly run by women, and women are more likely to
2157120	2158120	be empathizing.
2158120	2160480	No, I think it's a reason why they talk it out.
2160480	2164400	So I'm wondering if there's a gender issue going on there and a prejudice against a certain
2164400	2165400	way of thinking.
2165400	2166400	Okay.
2166400	2167400	What's that?
2168400	2172440	One of the reasons they took out the shop classes, they kind of just go, everybody's
2172440	2176640	going to go the university route and cost.
2176640	2179160	Good shop classes cost a lot of money.
2179160	2183440	Now people are starting to put shop classes back in, and you know what they're finding?
2183440	2186360	They can't find anybody that teach the shop classes.
2186360	2190760	I just heard about a brand new beautiful welding shop built here in Colorado at a community
2190760	2196480	college and they can't find somebody to teach it even after they dropped the university requirement.
2196480	2200480	And I can tell you right now, we need people that can do these things before the power
2200480	2202360	grid and the water systems fall apart.
2202360	2204720	I'll tell you that stuff I care about.
2204720	2205720	Right.
2205720	2206720	Right.
2206720	2207720	Right.
2207720	2208720	Yeah.
2208720	2213680	Well, do you think virtualization has also played a role in this?
2213680	2215200	I mean, the systematizing types.
2215200	2216200	You can't.
2216200	2220920	Some of the 3D drawings, I see a block.
2220920	2224240	And that's not going to fix some of the serious problems we've got with infrastructure right
2224240	2225440	now.
2225440	2227040	And you need both kinds of thinkers.
2227040	2232680	Like one of the things I've got in my book is where a bridge fell down in Minneapolis.
2232680	2234480	And the workers were complaining.
2234480	2237800	They were worried that when they were working on this bridge it was going to collapse.
2237800	2244160	Well, I looked up that bridge collapse and I saw all the twisted metal and I took one
2244160	2246880	look at that and I went, it's too light.
2246880	2249200	It's too cheap.
2249200	2252280	That was just from looking at the pictures.
2252280	2256320	And I found the engineering report on why that bridge fell down.
2256320	2261160	And they cheated on the gusset plates that hold the beams together and they were way
2261160	2263720	thinner than the spec.
2263720	2269320	But I had already looked at the pictures and said that bridge is too light, it's cheap
2269320	2274080	before I read any engineering report.
2274080	2282120	So how was it in your life that you attained the practical knowledge necessary to facilitate
2282120	2282960	your thinking?
2282960	2286480	So we're talking about how kids who take in the vision.
2286480	2287480	I'll tell you how you do it.
2287480	2288480	It's real simple.
2288480	2292400	You got to get out and experience all kinds of stuff because the more information you
2292400	2294760	put in the database, the better you get.
2294760	2299160	And going back to teaching a computer how to diagnose melanoma, you had to give it like
2299160	2304160	a couple of thousand melanoma examples and a couple of thousand mosquito bites, infected
2304160	2306800	boils and everything else, examples.
2306800	2312480	In other words, the more, as I got older and I got more and more information in my database,
2312480	2318400	I could think better and better and better and I could make smaller categories of things.
2318400	2322240	Now a lot of the people that I worked with in construction that build equipment for me,
2322240	2327480	that's used in every large beef plant now in the US, some of them started and some of
2327480	2329920	them would definitely be autistic.
2329920	2335120	One of them started out working on cars, another one took a single welding class and now he's
2335120	2340800	selling mechanical equipment all over the world, started with a tiny shop that then
2340800	2342440	grew into a big shop.
2342440	2350640	And what's happening now is the little shops are not forming and that's why we're importing
2350640	2355400	all this equipment from Holland and Italy because when you look at their educational
2355400	2361920	system and I looked it up again recently online, Italy actually has three routes, university
2361920	2368040	route, tech route, mechanical and art route, you know like for their fashion industry and
2368040	2372960	the Holland and Netherlands you can go either university route or tech route and that's
2372960	2377680	why they're making the state-of-the-art chip making machine that we don't make.
2377680	2378680	Right.
2378680	2383360	And I'm not talking potato chips, I'm talking electronic chips.
2383360	2384520	Right.
2384520	2390480	I wonder if this is also a consequence of people increasingly moving away from farms.
2390480	2394280	No, because when you're on a farm you'd have to do a lot of hands-on stuff, you have to
2394280	2398360	do a lot of fence repair, you've got to take care of your own machinery and as you move
2398360	2402840	into the urban environment everything in some sense even in the real world is virtualized
2402840	2406480	because you can always call on other people to do the day-to-day things that you need
2406480	2409000	to keep the infrastructure in place for example.
2409000	2410000	Well, I agree.
2410000	2415680	A lot of kids are growing up today totally removed from the practical.
2415680	2423160	And one of the things I talk about in the visual thinking book is I talked to a doctor
2423160	2428680	and he told me he had trouble training interns to sew up cuts because the interns had never
2428680	2431560	used scissors as a young child.
2431560	2436760	I had a student in my class that had never used a tape measure to measure anything.
2436760	2441120	And they're totally removed from the world of the practical where those kids that came
2441120	2446520	off the farms, yes, they had to figure out how to fix things, absolutely.
2446520	2451120	But I think what's happening now in the schools is things are getting so verbal and they're
2451120	2457400	going absolutely crazy on math requirements because I know people with 20 patents and
2457400	2462960	they could basically do sixth grade arithmetic that I could do because I can relate that
2462960	2465720	back to real things and things like.
2465720	2475440	Do you know of any research pertaining on how the people who visualize objects might
2475440	2477400	be assessed for their ability?
2477400	2478400	Yes.
2478400	2482080	And there's a whole chapter in here.
2482080	2487560	There's a whole chapter in here and I never can pronounce their names, Blank and Culver
2487560	2490480	and I never can say the names correctly.
2490480	2495700	But I have a whole list of references in there where the difference between the object visual
2495700	2499660	analyzer and the visual spatial is being assessed.
2499660	2501500	And there's a whole bunch of references on that.
2501500	2509340	Now I have to look these names up because I can't pronounce them correctly.
2509340	2516300	Let me find the reference list here for chapter two, okay, it's Blazhenkova.
2516300	2523220	I've got one, two, three references in here from Blazhenkova on types of creativity and
2523220	2535700	then the other big reference, I have lots of references, would be Kozhevnikov if she's
2535700	2542900	got trade-offs, object versus spatial visualization, reviewing the visual verbal dimension, evidence
2542900	2549300	for two types of visualizers, that's another paper, spatial versus object visualization,
2549300	2552620	a new characterization of visual cognitive style.
2552820	2559340	There's three papers right there from Kozhevnikov that are in my reference list and I've got
2559340	2565580	a lot of references where their actual tests were done.
2565580	2570340	When I go through the citation lists, I just went in and we're working on the children's
2570340	2576460	edition of the book right now and one of the copy editors had a query about a reference
2576500	2583260	and I had to look that up and then I decided to just type in object visualizer, visual
2583260	2590100	spatial into Google Scholar again and find the same old papers and then I found some
2590100	2595580	citations, it's kind of a cool paper here in the journal Cognition, it's an old paper
2595580	2599900	actually, visual objectability, a new dimension of nonverbal intelligence.
2599900	2605380	I know from working in factories, I spent 25 years in heavy construction and that is
2605420	2610820	something that I don't think many teachers have done that and seen how these guys think.
2610820	2618980	Big complicated Cargill plans, IBP plans which are now Tyson, Monfort plans, that company
2618980	2624900	is now JBS, figuring out complicated things with equipment.
2624900	2631740	It's a different type of intelligence and I think when I worked on the book with Betsy
2631740	2638660	Lerner, my super verbal co-writer who helped me organize things and she had someone come
2638660	2643860	in to fix a bunch of stuff in her house and after we had discussed this, Betsy was telling
2643860	2648900	me, well I watched how he figured out how to fix the stones on the chimney.
2648900	2653780	I had never really thought about it before but she watched how he did things and then
2653780	2658540	she started to understand there's a form of intelligence there that's absolutely not
2658660	2659660	verbal.
2659660	2663300	When she watched a person, she hired to fix stuff in her house.
2663300	2664780	Right, right.
2664780	2670180	Yeah, well you can imagine something and this did pop into my mind visually, can imagine
2670180	2675700	somebody who's trying to put together a stone chimney has to rotate stones to make sure
2675700	2679020	that they're going, like a Tetris game, that's a good way of thinking about it.
2679020	2683340	I was thinking then again, because I'm thinking in images now that we're talking, I was thinking
2683340	2689340	about my young grandson, he was only two years old, he had his Legos laid out in front
2689340	2693780	of him and when I was a kid, I played a lot with Legos and I played a fair bit with this
2693780	2699620	mechano set that was like a junior engineering set and it was certainly the case that working
2699620	2706260	with Legos was non-verbal because you're rotating shapes in space and having them fit into one
2706260	2714820	another towards some design end and that's a nice kind of hands-on learning and exposure
2714820	2720580	to different mechanical principles and so do you have recommendations for people who
2720580	2729340	want to help their children train their visual spatial and object visualization abilities?
2729340	2731020	Let's get them out building things.
2731020	2734580	The big mistake I see with a lot of kids is they're super good with Legos, they don't
2734580	2736260	think to introduce tools.
2736260	2740860	I was using tools by second grade, I was not using a saw, but I was using hammer, screwdriver
2740860	2746180	and pliers, I was taught how to use them safely, I've got another book of children's projects
2746180	2751780	called Calling All Minds where I describe bird kites that I spent hours with tinkering
2751780	2761700	to get them to work, to agree with parachutes to get them to open up more easily, kids today
2761980	2766820	are totally separated in the world of physical things.
2766820	2773660	They're not getting out and observing stuff out in nature, this is part of the problem
2773660	2780740	and I just went to a veterinary school where the students are so far removed from practical
2780740	2786020	things that to give them dexterity skills and surgical skills they have these plastic
2786020	2790340	tote boxes and they put children's puzzles inside them and they've got to just reach
2790460	2796060	in and by feel put these children's puzzles together because when they were in kindergarten
2796060	2797700	they never did this.
2797700	2799500	Right, right, right.
2799500	2804460	Yeah, well my parents told me that when I was four my favorite toy was a screwdriver
2804460	2809180	and that I used to take all the cupboard doors off the cupboards in the kitchens.
2809180	2813980	And so I was introduced to tools at a very early age and that there's a real practical
2813980	2819100	utility in that too because now if I visualize a project in my house shelving or something
2819100	2825380	like that or any construction project of any sort, well I can visualize the array of tools
2825380	2831460	that's necessary to make that come about and then I have the tools at hand and I know how
2831460	2840460	to use them and that is a, well, it's also, I really find that kind of work calming and
2840460	2841620	engrossing.
2844620	2846660	We'll be back in one moment.
2846660	2851140	Next we wanted to give you a sneak peek at Jordan's new documentary, Logos in Literacy.
2855140	2861540	I was very much struck by how the translation of the Biblical writings jump-started the
2861540	2864740	development of literacy across the entire world.
2864740	2866740	Illiteracy was the norm.
2866740	2872460	The pastor's home was the first school and every morning it would begin with singing.
2872460	2875660	The Christian faith is a singing religion.
2875660	2880580	Probably 80% of scripture memorization today exists only because of what is sung.
2880580	2881580	This is amazing.
2881580	2888140	Here we have a Gutenberg Bible printed on the press of Johann Gutenberg.
2888140	2894140	Science and religion are opposing forces in the world but historically that has not been
2894140	2895140	the case.
2895140	2897380	Now the book is available to everyone.
2897380	2906180	From Shakespeare to modern education and medicine and science to civilization itself.
2906180	2911900	It is the most influential book in all of history and hopefully people can walk away
2911900	2913780	with at least a sense of that.
2918300	2922340	Well the problem is is we got kids growing up today totally removed from the world of
2922340	2923540	the practical.
2923540	2925420	They don't use tools.
2925420	2927660	They don't use scissors.
2927660	2931660	I had a student in a class who had never used a ruler or tape measure to measure anything
2931660	2934220	ever.
2934220	2941300	I think that's a problem because if you haven't done practical things then you don't understand
2941300	2942300	how to fix things.
2942300	2945620	Okay like two years ago they had the horrible mess where the power you know like a bunch
2945620	2948540	of different power stations froze.
2948540	2953900	Well I never heard so much abstract gobbledygook about that because the way I would work on
2953900	2958540	fixing it would be all right let's look at each power station what piece of equipment
2958540	2960940	actually froze.
2960940	2964820	I never saw anything written in the press that described okay what froze in this plant.
2964820	2970780	What froze in this plant because my inclination would be to kind of rank them on okay a turbine
2970780	2974780	haul that froze I can build a building over it that's an easy one you know a whole bunch
2974780	2981900	of gas wells froze that's gonna be like really difficult to fix but you see nothing's abstract
2981900	2986740	because okay if I'm gonna try to figure out how to fix it I don't really want to argue
2986740	2992060	who owns them I'm not interested in the politics I would just rank the power stations on expansiveness
2992060	2998060	and difficulty to winterize and say exactly what piece of equipment froze and you know
2998060	3002660	how I can find out you let me loosen there away from the managers I'll find the maintenance
3002660	3004540	shop they'll show me everything.
3004540	3009300	And I know enough about equipment that they can't BS me.
3009300	3015660	Right so maybe part of the advantage to that more visual form of processing is also its
3015660	3022660	association with that kind of practical particularization that's right that's right now on the other
3022660	3027460	hand I have no idea how to balance a power grid that's a job for the mathematicians you
3027460	3034940	see this is where we need to work together and in a complementary factor in a complementary
3034940	3039380	way and I tell people in big corporations that I've done a lot of talks for businesses
3039380	3048540	your first step is that you've got to recognize different kinds of thinking exists and let's
3048540	3053500	take another example recently I visited two really nice dairies up in Quebec Canada that
3053500	3058300	have the robotic milking machines where the cow can go in she decides one she wants to
3058300	3064540	get milk and get fed and on both dairies it actually made some good mechanical modifications
3064540	3070300	on that equipment which the equipment company finally adopted but one of the dairy producers
3070300	3076380	said to me I stop at the computer stuff I don't mess with the program that's somebody else's
3076380	3082100	job to work on the software but the mechanical parts of the device they figured out ways
3082100	3089220	to improve it yeah it's like a it's like a hierarchy man you can imagine a hierarchy
3089220	3095460	of generalization with the highest resolution lowest level being the particulars of a given
3095460	3102580	machine then you can imagine people but specialized to operate at different levels of the hierarchy
3102580	3107500	maybe the verbal types are operating at the high well that's right they are but they lose
3107500	3111660	that particularization that's right that's basically right because the verbalizer tends
3111700	3116620	to overgeneralize one of the papers that are reviewed in my book on visual thinking was
3116620	3123220	an interesting study where on high school students that came life for school specializing
3123220	3127900	in the arts another school specializing in the sciences and another one especially in
3127900	3133380	the humanities which would be more verbal on those teams of students and their assignment
3133380	3140380	was to create a new planet so the art students heavily visualizing they made a planet with
3140780	3146220	crystals on it another one made a skyscraper planet and then the more mathematical science
3146220	3153420	students just painted a round made a round ball and described the gravity and the atmosphere
3153420	3158060	you know kind of boring pictures and the verbal thinkers started write it down and then they
3158060	3163420	go oh wait a minute we're supposed to draw the planet so they made kind of splotchy stuff on it
3163420	3169900	but the thing that was interesting is that the art minds more my kind of mind and the mathematical
3169900	3177020	minds they had big planning sessions on how to design their planet where the verbal thinkers
3177020	3181580	on they didn't do any planning you see this is the problem the verbal thinker would get big
3181580	3188620	broad concepts or something we need to do right but how do you actually implement those concepts
3188620	3194700	yeah right there's no detail there now in food safety we have a thing that I really like it's
3194700	3201100	called hazard analysis critical control points so let's say I'm out there in a sea of of things
3201100	3207180	I can do well I can't do all that stuff you see now the critical control point let's say in food
3207180	3215180	safety in a food factory I can't measure microbes and bacteria on everything in that plant I have
3215180	3222300	to pick out the places where I'm most likely to have contamination that would be the critical
3222300	3229900	control points and one of them is doorknobs yeah that's why some places food factories have
3229900	3237260	automatic doors because that gets rid of touching the door yeah well one of one of the things that
3237260	3244700	I always found a relief in working with engineers is that they were good and I can see it in the
3244700	3250860	terms that you're describing they were very good at rank ordering practical priorities right and
3250860	3257580	that that seems to be part of this particularization so I have this company it's a software company
3257580	3264700	that sells personality tests and and writing programs for people to help them plan their lives
3264700	3270460	and my business partners and engineer and although he's also very intelligent verbally he's more
3270460	3278060	intelligent non-verbally and he knows the systems right from the from the code upward at every level
3278060	3283580	of the machine instantiation and so the huge advantage to that is that if anything ever goes
3283580	3288940	wrong he knows exactly what goes wrong and he knows exactly how to fix it it's particularized
3288940	3294620	down to the point where that makes action possible eh and that's part of the problem with the with
3294620	3299900	the verbal abstraction is that it makes sense conceptually but that doesn't mean that it's
3299900	3304540	detailed to the point where it's actually implementable and then it it's like a pseudo knowledge
3304540	3311020	right because it sounds like you've got the picture right but when you actually try to
3311020	3316140	implement it you find out that that that it's really a hollow a hollow shell of conceptualization
3316140	3321740	well I kind of look at like this is why when I learned about the food safety concept of
3321740	3326300	hazard analysis critical control points or let's just call it critical control points
3326300	3333260	so I've got a big sea of stuff out there what's the really important thing okay now I I only think
3333260	3339980	in specific examples so let's take frozen Texas power stations the critical control
3339980	3347740	point is and I want it like in two sentences what great piece of equipment froze and then
3347740	3353420	you can very easily figure out the ones that'll be easy to winterize and I've actually talked to
3353420	3359820	somebody who installs gas wells and I only cost $5,000 to winterize a well when you build it
3359820	3365500	to retrofits a complete mess he also said you have to have someone who knows how to turn the
3365500	3372540	valves he said that's me right I call him the guy in the pickup and that person in that pickup
3372540	3379180	truck is not getting enough credit he knows how to turn those valves right yeah so if you
3379180	3385100	conceptualize that verbally you end up saying something like a bad winter storm took out the
3385100	3391340	Texas power grid and that sort of sounds like you've said something but it's nothing like saying
3391340	3398220	well the grid is made out of 200 different uh like industrial assemblies each of those
3398220	3403020	is made up of a variety of parts that's differentially susceptible to winter all right well that's
3403020	3409020	still gobbledygook because first of all they wouldn't have 200 separate power stations you know it's
3409020	3418380	more like 10 something like that and and I would just let I listen well write down the name of the
3418380	3422780	station because I don't really care who owns it and what we used to do with meat packing plants when
3422780	3428060	we were doing welfare audits is we'd always call them by their town names because you're auditing
3428060	3433740	that particular plant next I will this power station at a frozen turbine hall that's an easy one to
3433740	3440220	fix on then there was a coal fire that froze well as they freeze up the where you have a cold
3440220	3448940	bump sand that's probably really easy to fix and if you know 50 gas wells froze up the feet of plant
3448940	3456060	that's going to be a mess to fix on but you see as I talk about these things I see it and I happen
3456060	3461100	to know what some of the equipment looks like you see that also makes me a better troubleshooter
3461100	3466780	you know if I know what stuff looks like you see this is where you've got to put things in my database
3468220	3474380	but I but I worked 25 years out in factories on heavy construction stuff so I know what a lot
3474380	3480700	of stuff looks like right so so it means in some sense that to solve the problem is you take the
3480700	3487260	verbal representation so the verbal representation is a storm took out the texas power grid and then
3487260	3492860	you say well there's 10 key components to that's okay our grid so that differentiates that and then
3492860	3501020	you say in each of the 10 systems there are critically vulnerable points that are specifically
3501020	3505820	sensitive to cold weather we need to differentiate and find out what those key ones are then we
3505820	3510620	have to differentiate that further you see now okay now when I first started my work there was no
3510620	3516060	Google Earth well the first thing I do probably Google Earth and Street View the power stations
3517340	3522540	and the other thing I've learned if I want to get accurate information I don't you don't talk to the
3522540	3529020	managers you got to get down in the shop and and then the shop guys have to be not worried about
3529020	3534300	getting fired that's another right right nasty issue that I'm going to have to deal with
3535740	3540780	but you know let's say I get three shop guys together and we have okay my industry say when
3540780	3545100	we get rid of all the suits you know that's going to be the managers and the verbal thinkers
3545100	3548860	they won't talk in front of suits they're afraid they're going to lose their jobs
3549740	3553980	you know and this is something I know from all the years I've worked in this stuff
3553980	3559420	and then they'll take you out there and show you what froze and then oh there's creative things I've
3559420	3564860	talked to a guy I worked in a power plant and there was this one sensor very important electronic
3564860	3572060	sensor and it gets cold and when it got cold he put plastic garbage bags over it and I'm going
3572060	3577260	right well I think we need to have something a little more permanent to keep that sensor warm
3577260	3585500	than black plastic garbage bags that's what I told him yeah so so that that issue that the the guys
3585500	3591180	with the hands-on knowledge have to worry about being fired is interesting too because it seems
3591180	3597500	like so they have this extremely detailed knowledge that's practical about how these systems operate
3597500	3603020	and what happens is if they bring that knowledge up the abstraction hierarchy what they're doing
3603020	3608460	in some sense is is pointing out the manner in which their superiors their hypothetical
3608460	3617580	well that's the problem and a very big problem I've had is um I they're they're worried about
3617580	3625660	losing their jobs yeah and and but you really want to solve the problem they need to be able to
3625660	3630780	talk to you freely because they're the ones that tell you exactly what froze
3632540	3639100	right well the question is why would their attempts to bring their practical reality to bear
3639100	3645180	as they move information up the information hierarchy why would that threaten people to the
3645180	3652380	point where they would be intimidated in relationship to their job I mean why is there this gap the
3652380	3657100	psychological gap between the practical and the abstract I mean you'd think that the managers
3657100	3662380	would be calling on these people all the time you got to drag those suits out of the office too
3662380	3670140	just when things are working normally and so they get a better understanding of what the
3670140	3676220	practical people are doing now my animal welfare work on one of the things where I made some of
3676220	3680780	the biggest difference in animal welfare work is auditing programs I helped develop with McDonald's
3680780	3688620	Wendy's and Burger King back over 20 years ago and in this situation we were taking vice president
3688620	3695420	level managers out to the plant and they'd have these undercover boss moments just like that show
3695980	3701020	I'll never forget the day when the McDonald's vice president saw a half-dead dairy cow go into
3701020	3707980	their product and he goes yeah we got some things here we have to fix you see before it was all an
3707980	3714060	abstraction spreadsheets numbers okay animal welfare give it to lawyers give it to the public
3714060	3720540	relations department but when they came out of the office and they saw something bad now it was real
3720540	3727340	now they had to act it was no longer abstract anymore there seems to be a kind of pride in that
3727340	3732540	abstraction in some sense I mean I've also noticed that highly intellectual people and maybe those
3732540	3738060	are ones who think primarily in words tend to be rather dismissive of the intelligence of more
3738060	3744300	practical people like working people and that's I come from a working class environment so although
3744300	3749420	I've hung around verbal people most of my life so I can see that dichotomy do you have any sense of
3749420	3758860	why it is that the more abstract thinkers are have a well because they used to say okay the kids
3758860	3763900	that are like failing in high school stupid kids go and shop well I can tell you right now
3763900	3769420	right exactly I worked big metal fabrication companies owned by these so-called stupid people
3769420	3773340	and what they they were inventing equipment they had 20 patents and they were very proud of their
3773340	3779820	patents and one of them made posters out of them put them up all over his place it's a different
3779820	3788460	kind of intelligence and and it's not you know there's things they can do that the verbal thinkers
3788460	3793820	can't do and what I what I'm really interested in is we need all the different kinds of minds
3794540	3799900	because one of the problems with my kind of thinker since I'm associative is the point in a company
3800460	3804940	let's say I had a metal fabrication shop I'd have to hire a verbal thinker just to run the business
3804940	3811260	the payroll ordering materials things all of that part of it do you think it's a competition
3811820	3816780	do you think it's a competition for status between different forms of neurodiversity
3817420	3822860	I mean if I can claim that my intelligence is paramount that that increases my social status
3822860	3827980	in some sense right you can imagine there's a competition for that broadly going on in society
3827980	3834940	what I have found is when you got the verbal thinkers out in the field their eyes got opened
3836940	3843180	that the important thing is you got to drag the suits out of the office I've done a whole lot of
3843180	3849420	that and let me tell you they changed okay I've done a lot of work on supply chain management
3850140	3855180	and when there's supply chain disasters like a factory burning up and a clothing industry
3855260	3861100	disgusting industry they need to clean up a lot of stuff and a factory burns up a hundred people
3861100	3869500	selling bluejanes well the suits didn't get out of the office and see what was going on in these
3869500	3875500	factories until there was a disaster the one they should have been preventing a disaster like that
3876540	3881740	right well yeah so once you build up hierarchical organizations it's very easy for the people who
3881740	3887500	are operating near the top of the abstraction chain not to pay attention to the details and
3887500	3891340	hopefully the details are working out so well that you don't have to pay attention to them I mean
3891340	3896220	that's in some sense the point of building a hierarchical organization but but what you need to
3896220	3902380	do obviously the manager can't be you know doing every job out there in a plant but they need to
3902380	3908540	have enough contact with the field and I'm going to use the field be like the factory floor farming
3908540	3916380	you know waterworks any of these kind of things so they they understand the difference
3916380	3921340	there can be things bad going on but I tell business managers and I've talked to many big
3921340	3929100	corporations computer companies steel companies on pharmaceutical companies that the first step is
3929100	3936060	realizing that different kinds of thinking exist and that they can work together in complementary
3936060	3943260	ways and you actually need the whole team you need the whole team because we're kind of
3943260	3948700	disorganized and associational and I'm going to need a verbal thinker if I got a really big
3948700	3957500	business to you know keep the business going so what do you think what do you think of the
3957500	3965180	suppositions and you talk about them a bit in your book that the visual versus verbal modes of
3965180	3970540	cognition map to some degree on to hemispheric specialization well that the right is more
3970540	3975340	oriented towards your kind the right hemisphere is more oriented broadly speaking towards
3975340	3981020	speaking broadly so it dominates your mind yeah but broadly speaking that's true you know
3981020	3986700	they're accept they're exceptions to some of that that stuff but I'm the thing that I want to talk
3986700	3995180	about is is right now I'm seeing too many kids that are dyslexic autistic or whatever I'm
3996220	4002380	ending up playing video games on a disability check when they could be photographers I got
4002380	4009900	four person crew here right now doing this filming and that's an interesting career
4009900	4016060	or they could be designing mechanical equipment and they never get an opportunity to do photography
4016060	4021020	art or mechanical equipment because it kind of looked at these stupid kids
4022620	4028300	right right okay so there's a privileging of this semantic and that's partly because it's
4028300	4034220	cheaper it's easier it's detached from the world in some sense how do you think we should redesign
4035260	4039820	schools for say kindergarten kids and elementary kids in some practical way you tend to think
4039820	4046060	practically what do you what do you think would be a good start well like in the 50s when I went
4046060	4051180	to school we had all kinds of craft projects I was learning to use little blunt scissors probably
4051180	4056060	in first grade I'd be putting all the hands-on classes back into schools and that's going to
4056060	4064780	include theater music cooking sewing when I went to elementary school I loved art sewing and wood
4064780	4070540	working and if I hadn't had those classes I would have hated elementary school and I loved sewing
4071340	4075900	and I'm what I was in fourth grade I had a singer sew handy a toy sewing machine that
4075900	4080380	actually sewed and it was one of my favorite things because I could make things with it
4081340	4088460	kids are not doing enough of that kind of stuff today right okay so there's a return to the there's
4088460	4093340	there's a need for a return to the practical on in some sense on both sides of the gender
4093980	4100460	everybody on every way with and I would now I went when I was doing a book signing for visual
4100460	4108460	thinking I went to on a physics lab in Harvard this room's labeled physics lab and they had all
4108460	4113260	kinds of 3d printers on there but they also had a sewing machine and they also had a station for
4113260	4119820	crocheting this is the building labeled engineering department at Harvard maybe they're realizing
4119820	4123660	they've got to get them doing some hands-on things this is when I did the book signing
4123660	4129180	for this it was part of the book tour the other thing I've noticed I stayed I got into some
4129180	4137180	interesting places I stayed at this hotel where where they is in Evansville Illinois where they had
4138620	4144780	textbooks in the rooms from the 1930s I wish I'd had more time to look at it and I pulled out an
4144780	4152380	electrical engineering book and it had a lot of math in it but it was much more applied they'd
4152380	4156700	say well this is how this is the generator works this is the math that goes well but it would
4156700	4165820	describe how the generator actually worked it was much more applied and I now the physiology book
4165820	4171260	that I had in the 70s you know explain how the kidney works how the heart works and then explain
4171260	4175740	the chemistry now I look at a physiology book and it's much more verbal a lot more math and
4175740	4181820	chemistry but how does the kidney actually work I still have my old Duke's physiology of domestic
4181820	4188460	animals from 1970 and I want to go back and compare that to the Duke's physiology now and
4189100	4197260	and it's like we're taking the practical out I just got an email yesterday from the UK that they
4197260	4202460	wanted to take a technology and design course out of a high school you see I think this what's
4202460	4208140	happening now is mathematics is totally taking over yes we need mathematics because my kind of
4208140	4213820	mind is not going to touch boilers and refrigeration in that food processing plant that's a job for
4213820	4221500	the mathematicians but what we're losing is the object visualizer right right right yeah well I
4221580	4228300	wonder I wonder too if part of this is the fact that you know for a long time in our society
4228300	4234060	a lot of this practical machinery just worked and so we could afford to ignore it in some
4234060	4240060	abstract sense right because our cars worked and our power grids worked and we could take all of
4240060	4244460	this low-level infrastructure for granted now that meant there were a lot of people on the shop
4244460	4249980	floors who were busily working making sure it worked but it did mean that we had the luxury to
4249980	4255820	engage in abstract specialization and maybe we could fall prey to the psychological tendency
4255820	4262540	to just dismiss all that well you see when they first started about 20 years ago is when they
4262540	4268460	started taking shop classes out of the schools well you can get away with that for a while
4269020	4276700	and then the people I worked with on gray now are retiring they're retiring out and they're not
4276700	4282140	getting replaced that's happening with elevator and escalator mechanics that's happening with airplane
4282140	4288140	mechanics and I'm seeing that more and more and more and more as I travel these are free things
4288860	4297420	that I see all the time and they are getting gray right right so yeah the retirement problem's going
4297420	4303500	to be the retirement although there's when it comes to industry there's two gigantic mistakes
4303500	4311100	that were made shutting down in-house engineering shops 20 years ago we had a huge metalworking
4311100	4316860	shop called the Montfort fab shop and it was part of the engineering of a company called Montfort so
4316860	4323580	no longer exists now well that's been shut down and then at the same time we took out shop classes
4323580	4329820	now in the short run it was cheaper for these companies to just farm out engineering work they
4329820	4337100	need to do in their plant yeah that works fine until the shops retire out and now what's happened
4337100	4340860	like I can't go in the name give you the name of the company but I have a client right now
4341580	4348140	where the one shop that's left is ripping people off at five times the price and that's happening
4348140	4357340	right right do you see any positive consequences of computer technology for object visualizers
4357340	4362300	and for the for the people who are working more in the visual spatial end of things well it's
4362300	4368860	definitely useful to you know like the visualization and stuff you can do on computers but that doesn't
4368860	4376620	replace real things let me tell you power grid I lay awake at night about that and that's so fragile
4376620	4381660	that I'm not I'm not going to go into any detail because it's too fragile and I'm not going to
4381660	4387740	discuss the things that I visualize and lay awake at night about the power grid because it's just
4387740	4395900	okay um okay I'm curious about that why not discuss them because I don't want to give I don't want to
4395900	4401740	give people that have bad intentions any information on how to hurt the power grid okay okay okay I see
4401740	4408620	I see that is the reason right because it's very easy so when you and I don't want to give out any
4408620	4413580	information that would help somebody damage the power grid so I don't discuss the details here
4413580	4420860	but I'm seeing them right now right right right yeah well that's part of that ability to think about
4420860	4425660	critical points of failure well there's I know exactly I'm engineering mind I know where the
4425660	4432620	critical points of failure are and I'm not going to discuss them right right so we can all be thankful
4432620	4440220	that you're not a terrorist yeah I'll be thankful I'm not a criminal yes exactly exactly yeah well
4440220	4447580	I've always often been afraid when thinking along the same lines that you're describing of just exactly
4447580	4452540	how fragile things are in that regard and how much someone with a good imagination how much
4452540	4457900	damage they could do if they targeted things properly it is really quite frightening to apprehend
4457900	4463180	well that's why there's certain things about the power grid I am not going to discuss and I'm seeing
4463180	4469820	three big fat critical control points right now I'm seeing them in my mind and they make me cringe
4471420	4476940	right so so could we talk a little bit about the specifics of your work I remember one of the
4476940	4482860	stories you told at this Tucson conference was about you talked about cows that they would do
4482860	4487580	such things as go into a field and look at if you look left a briefcase on the field for example
4487580	4493260	the cows would eventually come and look at it yeah that's right a cow's in a in a line might be
4493260	4500780	stopped by something like a coke bottle in their path and so you used your ability to think like
4500780	4507340	animals to design systems for animal handling that were much more humane so could you walk us
4507340	4514060	through that a little bit well the first work I did with cattle was in the 70s in Arizona I
4514060	4518780	when I didn't even know that I had was a visual thinker and other people were not a visual thinker
4518780	4523340	and I noticed that if there was a coat hung on the fence the cattle would stop
4524220	4530300	on if there was a shadow or reflection off a vehicle so I got down in the shoots to see what
4530300	4536620	they were seeing and I would take pictures down inside the shoot and people thought that was kind
4536620	4544620	of crazy but now I'm like right just recently did start up at a really big plant and at 10 o'clock
4544620	4549740	in the morning everything was working fine and then at three o'clock in the afternoon a big shadow
4549740	4555420	appeared I called the spider monster and it was just a shadow and these cattle decided they weren't
4555420	4561180	going to walk over that so they'll have to build a roof over the facility so that the cattle can't
4561180	4567340	see the spider monster on the other thing I'm I show I show people how to do is watch your lead
4567340	4572780	animal your lead animal will come up and stop and look at the thing they don't like the same plant
4573420	4579020	on the night shift okay the shadow monster wouldn't be there they either the guy calls me and he goes
4579020	4584940	they go halfway up the shoot and stop all right what do I do I said now bring up a nice calm bunch
4585020	4590460	of cattle watch your leader really carefully he'll look right at the thing he doesn't like
4591340	4597580	and there's an LED light on the corner of a building and they took that down and then everything
4597580	4605260	worked fine how do you identify the leader well there's always a leader when when all right let's
4605260	4612060	say I take a 20 head of cattle out of a pan there's a lead animal that walks out first usually one
4612060	4617580	of the more bold animals not the dominant animal the dominant animal that pushes the others away
4617580	4622060	from the feed trough he's in the middle of the herd or she's in the middle of the herd but the
4622060	4627260	leader will come out of the pen first and the other cattle follow and it's just the first animal in
4627260	4631500	the group it's a leader it's that simple you see as we're talking about that I'm seeing it
4633100	4639820	okay so so is that leader stable across instances of leadership and is that associated with this
4639900	4646620	ability to find what's anomalous and to deal with well in cattle that have lived together for a while
4647420	4653500	tend to stay in the same order you know years ago when your tags came out that were sequentially
4653500	4657900	numbered in other words you could just buy a package of ear tags labeled one through 200
4658860	4664220	and they put them on their cattle and one of the things that surprised ranchers when maybe 200
4664220	4669420	cattle came back the following year to go through the shoots to get vaccinated and they were coming
4669420	4678780	to in almost the same order now that's a group of cattle that live together okay is there something
4678780	4683740	okay so you made the observation that the lead animal will stop and look at the thing that he
4683740	4690300	doesn't like and so are the other animals and but it also that lead animal wasn't the physically
4690300	4695260	dominant animal he's got some other characteristics the animal it's dominant at the pushing others
4695260	4700780	away from the water trough or the feed trough but the but once the lead animal walks the other
4700780	4705740	cattle usually will follow same thing was shaped the other animals will usually follow right so you
4705740	4711900	remove the distractions that the lead animals reacting to and and at this particular plant
4711900	4715900	we had two things we had to get rid of we had to get rid of the shadow the spider monster shadow
4716540	4719820	and we had to get rid of an led light that was on the corner of a building
4720140	4729100	so do you have any sense on of why the other animals come to rely on the lead animal like what's
4729100	4734700	the lead animal being selected for or is it just a first mover well the leader of this lead animal
4734700	4739900	you see there's different levels of fear in animals genetically some animals are more bold
4739900	4747420	other animals are more shy or you can call those high and low fear and the animal that's more bold
4747420	4757260	is more likely to be the leader than the animal that's more anxious and and and you know if you
4757260	4761420	down with a bunch of cattle that have lived together all the time you know that there'll be
4761420	4766140	certain animals that tend to be the leaders and then you've got the big one with the giant horns
4766140	4770140	and she shoves everybody else away from the feed trough there's something that's very profound
4770140	4775580	about that because you're laying out the fact that it isn't the dominant animal that leads no
4775580	4781100	and that it's the animal that's exploratory and that's somewhat willing to take risks that
4781100	4787660	that's right but also absolutely also that the that the lead animal will spot anomaly right like
4787660	4793500	the spider monster that you're describing and so it's not like they're they're so bold that
4793500	4799100	they're completely without fear they're still acting cautiously in some sense all right so you
4799100	4803500	can walk the lead animal down a chute and you can see what it's going to see and you can actually
4803500	4807420	do that because you go down there and do it but you also think that way you've got to bring your
4807420	4812380	cat up really calmly to see because if you bring him up at a run then the leader just turns back
4812380	4817260	and you don't know what it's reacting to oh yeah i said to him now bring him up nice and calm watch
4817260	4822380	the leader come up the chute and when he stops he'll look right at the thing he doesn't like and
4822380	4827580	he looked at the led light on the corner of the building then they texted me a picture of it and
4827580	4835820	they got rid of that and that fixed the problem now have you have you have you developed some sort of
4835820	4842940	picture of the class of things that stop cats yes yes i have the spider mode okay so tell me what
4842940	4848940	sort of thing i have him to stop cattle i have pictures i have checklists of things to look for
4849980	4856700	reflections on water at this particular plant there was a gate handle a gate handle that jiggled
4856700	4861980	and it was right by the chute entrance i said that needs to be fixed so this gate handle doesn't
4861980	4870140	vibrate so what's common do you what's common about the things that stop cattle in their tracks
4870140	4875340	or or can you extract out well let's look at let's look at cattle's a prey species animal
4876060	4882940	so you're looking for things that might be a danger some little little bits of rapid movement set
4883020	4890860	them off and and something that's sort of like shouldn't be there like you can put a white plastic
4890860	4894380	bottle in the entrance of the chute now about shut a meat plant down
4896380	4902460	i they'll just keep turning back away from it turning back away from it right so they're looking
4902460	4907100	for something that doesn't fit the environmental pattern and that's probably doing something like
4907100	4912540	activating predator detection well that's right it's like that you know they they're looking for
4912540	4918700	stuff that you know a movement in the bushes maybe that's a mountain lion or a wolf some
4918700	4923740	little movement in the bushes the other thing about new experiences if you take something
4923740	4929180	like camera equipment cattle love camera equipment you put an expensive camera in the middle of the
4929180	4935340	pasture they will come up and knock it over and lick it to death that's what they will do
4935340	4942460	see things that are novel are attractive when the animal can voluntarily approach and scary if
4942460	4949420	you suddenly shove it in their face you suddenly shove it in their face then it's scary right and
4949420	4955820	so the best way that's a introduce new things to cattle is to let them voluntarily approach it
4955820	4960220	i don't know how many times people say to me my horse was fine at home he went crazy at the show
4960220	4966540	well you've got a lot of novel stuff they're like flags for example so you better get your horse used
4966540	4971020	to flags before you go there and the best way to get them used to flags would be to decorate the
4971020	4977580	pasture with flags and let your animal walk up and voluntarily approach them right right well you
4977580	4981660	know that's exactly what you do in psychotherapy when you're trying to help people overcome
4981660	4986620	aphobia right so if someone's afraid of an elevator and won't get in it that often happens
4986620	4995020	with agoraphobia what you do is you say to them okay um let's start by imagining elevators so that's
4995020	5000060	going to make you a bit nervous but imagine an elevator at some distance that doesn't make you
5000060	5007180	uncomfortable okay okay and then you say okay well now you've done that see if you can move yourself
5007180	5013100	in your mind closer to the elevator door and then you keep doing that but it has to be voluntary
5013100	5018060	it's 100% absolutely necessary for it to be okay so maybe you run them through this
5018620	5023340	imaginal exposure therapy and then you say okay for our next session what we're going to do is
5023340	5026620	we're going to go out in the hallway you know that elevator you wouldn't take we're going to go out
5026620	5031420	in the hallway we're going to stand 200 feet away from the elevator and you're just going to look at
5031420	5037500	it if you can't and so they'll do that has to be voluntary and then you can get them 150 feet away
5037500	5043260	and 100 feet away and soon they'll be right up to the elevator door I was very anxious
5043900	5050620	I you know my 20s and I got terrified of airplanes because I was an extremely scary
5050620	5055420	emergency landing when I was a senior in high school they put the slides down and the whole thing
5056060	5061740	very very scary and one of the ways I got over that is I had to make aviation interesting
5062300	5068140	and when I got the ride in the cockpit of a plane flying on Holstein Hefers to Puerto Rico
5069100	5076620	that made it interesting you make something scary interesting because I know another thing they do
5076620	5081660	on the elevator phobias is they show them how the safety mechanisms work that the elevator is not
5081660	5088700	going to fall down the shaft yeah well you you you know you even compel that interest to some
5088700	5095340	degree so for example one once you get a phobic person inside an elevator what they'll tend to do
5095340	5101660	is look at their feet and so you say to them look quit looking at your feet look at each corner of
5101660	5108460	the elevator look at all the numbers look at the display panel like you have to facilitate their
5108460	5114220	voluntary visual exploration okay and to some degree what you're doing is you're calling out
5114220	5119420	their interest to say attend to all of these things as if they're interesting and then that's
5119420	5124220	how they familiarize themselves with the elevator and they also note that well they're in there
5124220	5128620	because you have to look at the elevator to know you're in an elevator right literally you have to
5128620	5133420	move your eyes and point at all the different parts of the elevator and the more that you can help
5133420	5139980	people do that at a high level of detailed resolution voluntarily the more likely they are not not
5139980	5144940	only to become less afraid of the elevator is that that actually isn't what happens is you actually
5144940	5150700	train them in a form of exploratory bravery because what you teach them is that if they use
5150700	5156780	their eyes voluntarily to scan what they're afraid of they'll become braver and then that generalizes
5156780	5163180	to all sorts of other instances too so if you train someone to be less afraid of an elevator
5163180	5168860	they're much less afraid of other things as well well that's right and the thing that we're saying
5168860	5174220	I'm seeing now in dogs you know we have very strict lease laws here and there's more problems with
5174220	5178700	dogs being afraid of the veterinarian because they haven't been out experiencing enough stuff
5178700	5184220	like strange people touching them for example just going to lots of different places you know this is
5184220	5190380	the reason why when they train service dog puppies you take them everywhere so that there's almost
5190380	5197980	nothing that will frighten them yes yeah well that that that's the same argument you were making
5197980	5202140	earlier about the fact that to train people practically we have to put them in a lot of
5202140	5207420	different practical hands-on situations and so that they can generalize across all those instances
5208220	5213740	and so experience that's too narrow is too is too restrictive well when I get worried that
5213740	5220620	we're going to have people making policy on all kinds of important stuff on when they're so far
5220620	5226460	removed from the world of the practical you see we need to have both because all the problem with
5226460	5232780	us practical people is we're not organized enough that's where just about every tech company
5233340	5238540	has to hire a suit eventually just to keep the company organized somebody's got to pay the payroll
5238540	5244540	somebody's got to pay the taxes somebody has to make sure the rent is paid you know if they need
5244540	5251180	more office space then they've got to go out and go shopping for office space you know they there's
5251180	5258220	uh and we really do need all the different kinds of minds well when I look at the ideological
5258220	5263980	solutions that are being put forward to the world's problems continually I do wonder the same thing
5263980	5270860	you're wondering about which is is this empty ideological representation a consequence of
5270860	5274940	the fact that the people who are doing this have no practical experience at all it's like
5274940	5280460	they're not thinking at the level of detail well I think that it's a problem because when I worked
5280460	5285820	originally this is over 20 years ago with McDonald's Burger King and Wendy's and they took the top
5285820	5291980	managers out into the field and implemented the auditing program it was interesting to see how the
5291980	5298940	animal welfare uh issue went from an abstraction give it to legal give it to public relations
5298940	5304940	to something real that they really needed to address you know half-dead animals going into your
5304940	5311020	products not okay right right right uh broken stunning equipment is totally terrible and not
5311020	5318620	okay and that's mainly a management problem and failure to do maintenance and and I and and and
5318620	5324860	and when I worked on that 1999 I got five journal articles published on this and I saw more change
5324860	5331020	than I'd seen and and in my whole career when these big companies were inspecting these plants
5331020	5337740	but I figured out a very simple scoring system if you couldn't shoot 95 of those cattle dead on
5337740	5343180	the first shot you failed the McDonald's audit it was that simple some very simple critical control
5343180	5347020	points if you had more than three percent of your cattle beller in their heads off when you're
5347020	5352780	handling them you failed the McDonald's audit okay so why why why did that turn out to be the critical
5352780	5359660	issue well the broken stunts were a big issue now on the handling I figured out a way to score
5359660	5364940	that that's very simple vocalization if you're poking cattle with too many electric prods or you're
5364940	5370860	slamming doors on them or whatever they're going to be beller in their heads off and I better not
5370860	5375500	hear any beller in coming out of the place where they kill them right here beller in coming out of
5375500	5380860	there somebody needs to get kicked off the approved supplier list it's that simple that's one of the
5380860	5387020	critical control right so you used so you used animal distress as an indication of that's right
5387100	5391980	efficiency of process okay can you can you walk us through some of your designs
5391980	5397820	I mean you designed these these circular cattle enclosures as well to calm them down
5397820	5402940	the circular designs are really nice but I'm also very proud of the fact there were 75 plants
5402940	5409020	on the McDonald's approved supplier list only three had to buy fancy expensive equipment
5409740	5413820	everybody else we fixed with management yeah three managers had to be removed I call that
5413820	5419340	manager ectomy on a lot of non-slip flooring had to go in because one of the things we measure
5419340	5426940	is slipping and falling and lighting cattle are scared of the dark on training people to move
5426940	5433900	smaller groups of animals and and put a solid side up so they don't see the vehicles passing by
5434620	5439660	and these very simple changes we were able to fix some of the older places and I'm very I used all
5439660	5444780	my design ability to figure out how to make some of the older facilities work even though they did
5444780	5451980	not have the fancy new equipment and then we had three science only three plants had to do a front
5451980	5457500	end remodel that was very very expensive that's three out of 75 I'm really proud of that oh yeah
5457500	5464460	that's all a big port yeah yeah plants in the US right so so tell me tell me tell me tell me what
5464460	5469420	your goals were okay so let's walk this through at the level of detail so why don't you tell people
5469420	5475100	about how these cattle handling plants work broadly speaking from from the time the cattle arrived
5475100	5480700	till the time they're processed let's say and then how were you brought in to fix them well
5481740	5487500	unloading a truck make sure you have a non-slip unloading ramp open the gates up let them out
5487500	5491580	you do not need to scream at them pound on the vehicle or stick electric prads in through the
5491580	5497660	holes in the side of the truck so let the cattle just get off and they will and then they should
5497660	5503180	walk quietly out of the truck if they got a scale weigh them on the scale and then quietly walk into
5503180	5507980	a holding pen get a drink of water maybe a lay down then when it's time to go up to the plant
5507980	5515660	somebody should come down bring a group of 20 out not a group of 50 and you quietly walk them up
5515660	5521980	the alley to where they get to where the round crowd pen is and the whole thing should be a calm walk
5522860	5529020	without slipping and falling and without moving and bellowing and and almost no electric prads
5530940	5534380	that and it should all be very calm walking is what it should be
5536380	5543900	right and and how many plants did you go analyze we had 75 plants on the on the approved supplier
5543900	5550860	list and only three of them had to have extensive renovations but we did have three plants where
5550860	5556780	the plant manager had to be removed right and so in those cases yeah why did you remove the managers
5557820	5561100	well the ones where we're able to get rid of the plant manager were the corporate ones
5561820	5567500	on the plant then we had one plant we used to call the problem child and manager was family and we
5567500	5571740	couldn't get rid of it and that plant would like you know fail on audit and then pass an audit and
5574300	5579660	but management has to decide that they're going to do things right you can have the best equipment
5580620	5586380	and it's not going to work if it's not managed in fact before we started these audits i had a
5586380	5591660	lot of equipment out in the field lots of equipment half my clients tore it up and wrecked it and one
5591660	5598860	that what the customer inspections and audits did is force the plant to manage the stuff they had
5598860	5607180	either brand new fancy stuff or older stuff and so how broadly did your innovation spread and how
5607180	5611900	rapidly and what were the consequences of that for the meat handling industry in general
5611900	5618140	well the auditing program was within six months as in the year of 1999 was adopted by mcdonald's
5618140	5623660	wendys and burger king and that covers just about all the big beef plants and i saw more
5623660	5630620	improvement than i'd seen in a 25 year career prior to that people were no longer using broken
5630620	5637340	equipment they were moving smaller groups of animals things were kept repaired and
5638380	5642140	and employees were better supervised and boy it made a big difference
5643340	5648700	so why do you think you were able to do this i mean you obviously can solve the problem
5648700	5655660	practically but how are you able to um make your way in the corporate world in a manner that actually
5655660	5660940	resulted a in people listening to you and b in changes actually being made because that's
5660940	5666300	that's quite a remarkable combination of unlikely achievements all right let's start off i started
5666300	5672620	out with equipment this was in my 20s and i found that selling equipment was much easier than getting
5672620	5677660	people to manage equipment correctly and early in my career i made the mistake that a lot of young
5677660	5685340	engineers make i thought i could make a self managing cattle handling facility that is bs and i got a
5685340	5689820	lot of systems out there the other thing that helped me to get systems out into the industry
5690380	5695980	is i wrote about them and i wrote about them in the meat industry and cattle industry trade press
5696940	5702380	wrote all kinds of articles just about how to do it so now i had a lot of equipment out there
5703260	5707660	center track restrainer and lots and lots of these big plants had one it's a piece of equipment i
5707660	5713340	developed with the guys in the shops that i've talked to you about earlier but half my clients tore
5713340	5719340	it up and wrecked it then i worked with a lady named janet riley at the american meat institute
5720060	5727340	and i came up with this very very simple scoring system for evaluating meat packing plants
5728060	5734620	and we wrote it up in our guidelines nobody used it for two years then mcdonald's approached me
5734620	5743580	to implement their animal welfare auditing program and it started out taking vice president level
5743580	5750780	managers out of the office they saw some bad stuff and it started out as a little training program
5750780	5756540	they already had food safety auditors in the plants auditing them that was already being done
5757500	5761900	and so i took the trains of food safety auditors to do the animal welfare audit
5762220	5769100	and within six months i saw more change that i had seen in my whole career prior to that
5769100	5774140	then wendy's got on board then burger king got on board and i made sure that everybody used the
5774140	5780060	exact same score so it was absolutely clear it was like traffic rules you know you know they
5780060	5785420	measure speeding we measured how many vocalizations the cattle did we measured how many animals
5785420	5791020	fell down those things were measured and the plants had to make certain numbers it was
5791020	5795900	absolutely clear there were five critical control points and they had to do all five of them to
5795900	5800780	pass the audit i kind of sometimes can't believe i pulled it off it worked me on my wildest dreams
5801580	5809100	but it was absolutely practical right right yeah well it did it is it is quite a remarkable
5809100	5813660	thing to pull off to to be able to make that kind of change in the corporate world so quickly that's
5813660	5818860	that's really quite remarkable the other reason i was able to make change i i practiced reverse
5818860	5824380	conflict of interest i had a lot of expensive equipment already out in the plants i've been
5824380	5830700	over backwards in the older facilities to figure out how to make that older facility work without
5830700	5836300	buying expensive equipment let me tell you non-slip flooring it can work wonders you know we did quite
5836300	5842220	a lot of that right but that's not that's not expensive equipment and i'm really proud of the
5842220	5846380	fact that i took some of the older facilities and we made them work and then we did have three
5846380	5853100	only three out of 75 plants that had to build an expensive front-end remodel and that was very
5853100	5862540	expensive so what would you say if if you had to put it into a few phrases you you weren't obviously
5862540	5867980	pursuing mere narrow profit at that time not there's anything wrong with profit you you were
5867980	5874300	serving some other goal i was serving the goal of improving animal welfare and i've been over
5874300	5881100	backwards to do reverse conflict of interest and i tried to take some of those older facilities
5881100	5889020	right some of them a bit shabby and make them work with simple changes like repairs non-slip
5889020	5894780	flooring changing the lighting and three plants had to have the plant manager removed and that's
5894780	5900620	great so what why were you why were you so concerned with animal welfare and how would you
5900700	5905820	define animal welfare why did that become paramount in your in your hierarchy of goals
5907020	5910620	well one of the reasons why i started working on the equipment is like the way cattle were
5910620	5915980	being handled was horrible you know electric prods on 100 i'm falling down crashing into things
5915980	5921340	people screaming at them uh cattle handling in the 80s was terrible absolutely terrible
5922540	5928780	and i i saw that as something that i could fix now i talked to a lot of young people the day
5928780	5933660	that want to you know do activism about some specific thing and it's way too broad
5933660	5938300	i want justice in the world for example right yes yes might be something they would say yes yes
5938300	5944140	and i say why don't you do something more targeted like using dna to show that this prisoner
5944140	5950460	was falsely accused you see now that's something a lot more targeted that you can actually do
5951100	5955820	yes absolutely and i think that is a huge problem with the way that kids are trained
5955820	5964220	morally in universities is that that grandiose vague uh activism replaces the actual practicalities
5964220	5968380	of problem solving that you're describing that actually make a difference why do you think it
5968380	5973740	was that animal suffering stood out for you is it is it partly because you you can think like
5973740	5977660	animals like what why do you think well you would how would you like to get shocked to electric
5977660	5982700	prods and be slipping and falling and crashing and defenses and things like that you'd be terrified
5983580	5991500	um and my goal was to improve how the cattle were treated when i talked to students about you
5991500	5998700	know activism i said what i worked on wasn't everything bad happening to animals i worked
5998700	6003340	on something targeted the thing that i'm seeing now with young people that want to make a difference
6003340	6008460	they say i want to have justice in the world or i want to like animals are treated terrible we got
6008460	6014940	to do something about it and i'm saying you're going to be more effective if you pick out something
6014940	6021500	relatively targeted i worked on cattle handling to start with that's not everything to do with animals
6022540	6028940	yes exactly or the example of using dna to show that this criminal was innocent that's something
6028940	6035740	much more doable and targeted that you can actually do right so how was it that the suffering of
6035740	6041340	animals in meat tracking in meat packing plants came to your attention to begin with so you said
6041340	6047100	the suffering you found that unbearable first of all it started out when i went out to the feed yards
6047100	6051500	handling cattle back in the 70s there's a lot of really horrible cattle handling
6053180	6059260	and i i made a mistake in the beginning that a lot of young engineers make they think technology
6059260	6065420	can solve all their problems and i mistakenly believed that i could build a self managing
6065420	6071500	cattle handling facility that's nonsense i know that now that's nonsense good equipment makes
6071500	6076860	good handling better but it doesn't replace management and what the auditing program did
6076860	6083100	is it forced people to manage the facilities and why why were you at the cattle handling facilities
6083100	6087740	to begin with i mean was this part of your academic training or was this part of the fact
6087740	6093180	that you'd grown up on a farm well i got interested in got to going out to my aunt's ranch and
6093180	6097340	this brings up the other thing students get interested in stuff they get exposed to
6098940	6104700	it's that simple in in one of the people i profiled in visual thinking was michael angelo
6105900	6111260	grubby little 12 year old dropped out of school but he was running around all the churches seeing
6111260	6117420	great art and he grew up with stone cutting tools okay that's the exposure then he started
6117420	6121820	making some stuff and then an artist took him in as an apprentice that's mentoring
6123260	6127340	good careers start first with exposure and the other reason why i'm so concerned about
6127340	6132380	taking all the hands-on stuff out of the schools is those things like let's say theater for example
6132380	6139020	exposed students i didn't care about being in the play but i loved making scene rate and costumes
6139020	6146140	that i love to do it now that's something that can become a career so let me let me we're running
6146140	6150140	out of time on this segment let me ask you one more question and then maybe i'll sum up our
6150140	6155820	discussion for everybody or try to extract out the gist you think primarily in pictures but you're
6155820	6160380	also an extremely effective verbal communicator i mean you've written a number of books you can
6160380	6166060	obviously talk your way into corporate environments and help people walk through the complex process
6166060	6170940	of restructuring say animal handling on a pretty much on a national scale how did you
6171660	6176540	how do you think you've been able to develop your verbal ability like what what did you do to
6176540	6181740	manage that all right it goes back to when i was seven years old and in my neighborhood all the
6181740	6186060	kids when they were seven when the parents had a party you had to put your good clothes on greet
6186060	6192620	the guests and serve the snacks be little hosts and hostesses that's what you had to do um i sold
6192620	6198620	candy for charity that helped me on talking to people the other thing i figured out very early on
6198620	6204780	is backdoors into jobs and most people don't see this in the hbo movie temple grand and there's a
6204780	6210780	scene where i go up to the editor of our state farm magazine and i get his card because i knew if i
6210780	6217980	wrote for that magazine that would help my career that's a back door writing i did a lot of writing
6218060	6224700	this how to handle cattle how to design facilities and i was so happy when one of my very early
6224700	6230780	articles got picked up by two other magazines you know it had made the national scene of course this
6230780	6236620	is all you know pre-internet and then that press pass got me into all kinds of meetings that helped
6236620	6243660	me to get into my next self-made internship with a swift plant i've recognized the back doors most
6243660	6249020	people don't recognize the back doors but lots of good jobs are gotten through the back door
6250620	6256860	right so you allied your ability to concentrate on focal details practically with the ability
6257420	6261740	and the willingness to communicate on at all sorts of different levels verbally
6261740	6267260	you were able to bring both that's getting too abstract for me i just go okay i got the card
6267340	6272780	within a week i i may i had done a master's thesis on cattle behavior in different types of
6272780	6279660	squeeze shoots and i i sent them a good article and they published it then i went back to them and
6279660	6285340	said maybe i could just write something for you every month i just walked into the office and
6285340	6289180	asked that job so i did that as a volunteer for about three or four months and then they started
6289180	6299020	paying me i wasn't shy to walk up and ask right right so so you developed a communication
6299020	6303740	communication expertise and a communication network at the same time that you were trying to
6303740	6308860	implement your practical solutions and both of those facilitated each other well in the very
6308860	6314620	beginning i wasn't even designing facilities and then i was just visiting all these feed yards
6315340	6320860	and writing for the magazine and that press pass got me into all kinds of places
6321980	6327500	i recognized the value of that press pass it got me into meetings in the 70s with $600
6327500	6334060	registration fees i was no way i could have afforded that this is 70s right right right
6334060	6339020	so what are what are you working on now you finished this this new book that came out in 2022
6339020	6344220	what are you doing now well i'm very interested in seeing the kids who think differently
6344220	6350380	get into good careers and that's going to be a major emphasis of the things that i do now be a
6350380	6355500	lot of speaking engagements a lot of you know interviews like this because i want to see those
6355500	6362060	kids that are different get into good jobs okay if they're visual object visualizer like me maybe
6362060	6368220	art job maybe photography job or a job building things if they're the more mathematical visual
6368220	6375660	spatial a good programming job a good on mathematics or chemistry job where you need the
6375660	6381260	mathematics there's too many kids that think differently i'm some of them just kind of going
6381260	6387500	nowhere i want to see them get into good careers and do things that will be constructive in the
6387500	6395740	world do something constructive so we're we're going to switch over to the additional half an
6395740	6400380	hour that i produced for the daily wire plus platform to delve into some of the biographical
6400380	6406380	details of your life before we close i'd like to just sort of wander over the territory that we've
6406380	6410460	covered and see if there's anything else see if you think this is a reasonable summary and if
6410460	6416220	there's anything else you want to add i've been talking with dr. temple grand in today
6416220	6424140	who's who's developed a spectacular career in modifying animal handling and also managed a lot
6424140	6429340	on the more purely intellectual front as well in terms of conceptualization of information
6429340	6437340	processing she's uh we talked a lot today about the difference in in in the ways that people think
6437340	6442460	concentrating mostly on the distinction between visual thinkers who tend to be more practical
6442460	6448220	and detail oriented and who are can be broadly differentiated into two categories and those
6448220	6455020	would be object visualizers and people who think more visually and mathematically contrasting them
6455020	6461340	with people who think more verbally we talked a fair bit about the prioritization of more verbal
6461340	6467820	and abstract thinking at the cost of this practical thinking and training in that practical thinking
6467820	6473340	we discussed how that's affected the school system and broader culture we discussed the dangers that
6473340	6479180	poses to the integrity of our society as we lose the people who have the hands-on knowledge
6479180	6485020	we talked about the psychological danger that poses to people who think more practically
6485020	6491420	concretely and and visually who are in school systems that are optimized for the verbal thinkers
6492140	6502460	we talked about temples um career at the detail level um ameliorating the suffering of animals
6502460	6509580	that across like nationally and internationally as it turned out partly because she decided
6509580	6516300	not to chase mere generalities but to focus on an actual problem which was the suffering of actual
6516300	6523740	animals in actual plants was willing to focus her um emotional concerns on something that was
6523740	6529420	practical and to marry that with a strategy that involved particularization and visualization
6529420	6535740	and verbal communication and practical interactions with corporations and also we closed
6535740	6540540	that with a discussion of the fact that what she's doing now is trying to bring to people's
6540540	6548060	attention in podcasts like this the fact that we seem to be um working contrary to our own
6548620	6557820	best interests by not um building educational facilities that help optimize the ability of
6557820	6564620	visual thinkers to function but also for society more broadly to take advantage of the
6564620	6570460	talents and skills of those people in the in innovation and in the maintenance of the infrastructure
6570460	6575660	that we already have around us and so I think that about summarizes what we talked about today
6575660	6581020	is there anything you want to add to that that definitely you know kind of um kind of summarizes
6581020	6585580	that we need all the different kinds of minds and they can when we understand that different
6585580	6591660	people think differently they can work in teams where they can collaborate and have complementary
6591660	6598540	skills I think that's that's uh something that's really important also right right right the thing
6598540	6604300	I want to one thing I would do with the schools is I'd put a lot of the hands-on classes back in
6604300	6611100	like art sewing woodworking shop welding auto mechanics theater because these are all things
6611660	6615740	expose kids to to things that can become possible careers too
6617980	6621980	right and those are all things that have to be done they're in an embodied sense you actually
6621980	6627420	have to it's not purely abstract any it's not abstract none of those things are abstract
6629340	6633900	yeah well that's I suppose a danger of moving so much education online as well as that it's going
6633900	6640140	to increase the degree well that's right the other thing when I went to did the book signing
6640140	6644380	for visual thinking I told you about the electrical engineering book from the 30s I found in this
6644380	6650700	unique hotel room but I also got put in the office of a professor in political science
6650700	6657420	and I looked at some of those books and it was so abstract theories about politics I I didn't
6657420	6663500	even understand it it had nothing to do with right or left it had to do with just abstractions
6663500	6668780	that were so abstract it made no sense to me now I'm going oh I wouldn't want this person in charge of
6668780	6675260	figuring out with the power bread you know I remember at this Tucson conference where I first
6675260	6681260	saw you speak after you spoke very practical talk very much like the one that you you delivered
6681260	6685980	today when we were talking a philosophy student got up because there were a lot of abstract thinkers
6685980	6692140	at this consciousness conference and asked you something extremely abstract and philosophical
6692140	6697260	and you did exactly what I would expect a good engineer to do which was to say you know I really
6697260	6701980	don't understand anything that you just said I don't know how to associate it with anything
6701980	6706940	practical and I'm completely unable to answer your question which I thought was just it was
6706940	6713820	ridiculously comical and I also thought um what would you say well targeted because it was the case
6713820	6718620	that you know you had been talking about real practical realities your ability to think like
6718620	6724140	an animal the fact that you had taken these practical set steps to ameliorate animal suffering
6724140	6732380	and that that had been so consequential and and so of obvious worth and then you were faced with this
6733100	6738540	flight into abstraction and and did what engineers always did do which is something like well yeah
6738540	6742700	but I don't understand that what does it mean practically which is a really good question
6742700	6746940	that you know it's a question that should be asked of abstract thinkers all the time what are the
6746940	6752780	devils in the details here that you're overlooking how much do you know about the systems that you're
6752780	6758940	abstractly representing and the answer to that is usually almost nothing well it's sort of like
6759660	6763580	you know we need all the three different base you know different kinds of minds you need the
6763580	6769980	object visualizers you know we're going to get the arts mechanical and photography and animals
6769980	6775740	you need the visual spatial mathematicians computer programmers chemists things that require
6775740	6781900	mathematics and we need the verbal thinkers because they're going to help organize things
6781900	6787420	you see you need yeah all three different kinds of minds and they should work together in a
6787420	6794460	complementary fashion all right well that's a good place to end this segment I would say I'm going
6794460	6800220	to go thank you thank you to everyone on YouTube and the associated podcast for your time and
6800220	6806220	attention I hope you found this discussion interesting and engaging and practically useful
6806220	6812140	as well I'm going to switch switch over to the daily wire plus platform and I'm going to talk to
6812140	6817660	dr. temple grand and a little bit more on the biographical and I want to lay out how her
6817660	6822780	her interest in the issues that she did pursue professionally made themselves manifest in her
6822780	6828940	life hello everyone I would encourage you to continue listening to my conversation with my
6828940	6833980	guest on dailywireplus.com
