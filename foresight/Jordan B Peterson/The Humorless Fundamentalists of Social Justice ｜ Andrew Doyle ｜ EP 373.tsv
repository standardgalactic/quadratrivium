0	4400	I mean, you mentioned, interestingly, people like Joe Rogan and Russell Brown being considered
4400	11760	a gateway to the alt-right. They're still traditionally politically more akin to the left,
11760	16320	but because they've deviated slightly, you have this kind of puritanical sledgehammer coming
16320	23040	down and saying, no, you're straying from what our ideology says you should believe.
23040	25920	And that, to me, also feels like a fundamentalist religion.
30720	45440	Hello to everyone watching and listening. Today I'm speaking, once again, because we've done it
45440	51040	before, with playwright, journalist and political satirist Andrew Doyle, also known as Titania
51040	59040	McGrath. We discuss the intentional irrationality of the far-left doctrines that use religious
59040	65440	rhetoric and practices, despite the absence of God, or perhaps the presence of a different God,
66160	72640	their paramount desire to dismantle societal structures, regardless of need or merit,
73920	76800	the argument for transcendence inherent in the pursuit of art,
77520	84560	and how woke culture stifles genuine expression, forcing dogma to take the place of fundamental
84560	91600	truce and, say, purposefully doing so. Looking forward to it. Well, Mr. Doyle, it's good to see
91600	96480	you again. I think we're damn near friends, or at least I like you. I don't know what you think
96480	100320	about me, but... The feeling's very much mutual, Jordan. Thank you so much for having me.
101040	104480	Well, that's good. Well, us reprehensible types, you know, we need to stick together.
104480	110480	We do. Yeah. Yeah, that's for sure. So, the first, I thought I'd hassle you for a bit. First,
111280	117280	I got two things to hassle you about, I think. The first is, it says on your Wikipedia page,
117280	123280	for whatever that's worth, that you regard yourself as left-wing, and so I think you deserve
123280	128320	some harassment for that. But also, I don't know what the hell that means anymore. And then,
128320	132240	after I've done bugging you about that, I thought I'd bother you about having a PhD in
132240	137840	early Renaissance poetry and make the humiliation complete. Okay, let's start with the left-wing
137840	142960	thing. Okay, yes. Well, firstly, I'd say that Wikipedia is full of errors. I wouldn't trust
142960	147440	absolutely everything you see on Wikipedia. However, on that score, I think it's broadly
147440	155360	accurate. I know that, I mean, I've never voted for a right-wing party. I did vote for Jeremy Corbyn,
155360	162480	which, to be honest, I now regret. As you should. I think if you were to... I'm with you. I don't
162480	166480	really know what left-wing and right-wing means anymore. I think the culture war has, in fact,
166480	170880	obliterated those two designations. I really do believe that because, you know, if you were to
171600	178400	write down my views on most subjects and sort of give them to an impartial observer and say,
178400	182400	is this person on the left or on the right? I think broadly speaking, most of my values
182400	188160	would fall into what traditionally would be considered left-wing. I think I have some sort of
188160	192240	more conservative values when it comes to culture and education and the arts, perhaps.
192240	195920	But that's the same as someone like George Orwell, who was very much a cultural conservative,
195920	201520	as well as being a socialist. I think economically speaking, I do believe in
202320	207680	fair disproportionate taxation of the wealthy. I do believe in the welfare state.
209520	214960	All of those sort of, I believe, in redressing economic inequality, looking out for working
214960	219120	class people, social mobility. So all of these kind of things, I think, would traditionally be
219120	223520	deemed to be left-wing. But I think what the culture war has effectively done is
224400	233520	it's substituted identity, group identity, for the notion of class and money. And what that now
233520	238320	means is that people who describe themselves as left-wing are nothing of the kind. I mean,
238320	243360	most of the activists that you see, the sort of most vociferous cheerleaders of the critical
243360	248400	social justice movement tend to be, well, let's put it nicely, quite posh. They tend to have
248400	252480	quite plummy voices, double-barreled names. They're called things like Hugo Pondsford and
252560	256640	Sage Willoughby and things like this, particularly the case with environmental activists. You know,
256640	261760	there's people who glue themselves to Van Gogh paintings and the statue of David or whatever
261760	266320	it might be. When they talk, they are almost like a caricature, like the kind of thing that I would
266320	273120	have invented as a joke of a kind of fact. And have invented, in fact. Exactly. Well, Tatania
273120	280640	McGrath has that name because she's very, very well off. Part of the joke with that and part of
280640	284320	what I find so funny about so many of these activists is that they are bleeding about
285360	291440	oppression and persecution and privilege, and they're independently wealthy. They've got,
291440	294640	they've had everything handed to them on a plate. They're not in a position to do that.
294640	302000	Andrew, you know, look, I noticed this when I was teaching at Harvard, at Ivy League
302000	310160	school, obviously. And so all of my students were the top 1%, obviously. And if they weren't at that
310160	317360	moment, they were going to be by the time they were 40. So at worst, they were top 1% in what would
317360	323520	you call infancy. There we go. And so you might think that'd be good enough on the privilege side,
323520	330720	but it seems to me that there's a small coterie of very noisy people for whom being rich and
330720	336320	privileged is not enough. They also want all the victimization privileges of being oppressed,
336320	341520	because then you can have bloody well everything, can't you? And if you're a narcissistic psychopath,
341520	346640	then everything is what you want and you want it now. And I want to just follow up on that a bit
346640	352400	with regards to this left-wing issue. So, you know, there's about a dozen studies now. I want to
352400	355760	write an article about this or maybe even a book. There's about a dozen studies now
356640	360640	looking at the personality predictors of left-wing authoritarianism.
361600	369920	And so from the end of World War II till 2016, social psychologists in particular,
369920	376080	and that's a rather dismal discipline, denied the existence of left-wing authoritarianism outright.
376080	383200	It was only a right-wing phenomenon, apparently. You know, I mean, Stalin and Mao, notwithstanding.
383200	388560	But it started to switch a bit in 2016. We did a study in my lab, first of all, showing that
388560	394480	left-wing authoritarianism was a coherent, you could identify a coherent set of beliefs
394480	400160	statistically that were associated with so-called progressive causes allied with the willingness
400160	405840	to impose them using force, fear, force, and compulsion. So that's not a bad definition of
405840	410880	left-wing authoritarianism. But then a number of other studies have come out, and the most
410880	417200	interesting ones concentrate on what's known as the dark tetrad. And the dark tetrad is a group
417200	421680	of personality traits that were too evil to make it into the standard personality models.
421680	428400	They were excluded by fiat to begin with. Manipulativeness, that's Machiavellianism.
428400	434720	Psychopathy, which is predatory parasitism. Narcissism, that was the original dark tet
434720	440320	triad. But that wasn't bad enough, so the psychologists had to add sadism to it to fill
440320	448240	in the last quadrant. And the correlation between dark tetrad personality traits and left-wing
448240	455200	authoritarianism is so high that it isn't obvious that they're distinguishable. And so what I see
455200	459200	is... Is it not similarly high amongst right-wing authoritarianism?
459200	463040	No, it's not. So it's a different kind of authoritarianism?
464000	470400	Yes. I mean, this isn't clearly laid out yet, but the focus at the moment...
471040	476400	I think, first of all, anybody who's willing to use fear and compulsion and force
477120	483200	is likely to also be characterized by those dark tetrad traits. But I think the additional
483200	488160	pathology that emerges on the left, and this is something we can discuss, obviously, is that
489040	498480	you have to be a particular kind of evil snake to mask your psychopathic power-mongering in the
498480	504000	guise of compassion. And I don't think the right-wing authoritarians do that. They more or less come
504000	508240	right out and say, like, fuck you, I'm going to take everything you have, especially if you're
508240	512880	a group I don't like. But the left-wing types, they say, well, you know, really, I'm your best
512880	517840	friend. Historically speaking, is that necessarily the case? I mean, you know, if you take the example
517920	524480	of the Third Reich and Nazism, that was underpinned by a belief, a sincere belief,
524480	527920	a sort of quasi-religious belief that what they were doing was for the good of society.
527920	529760	However, abhorrent, we might find it.
530720	535040	Look, fair enough, man, I know perfectly well that in the 1930s, for example,
535040	540960	as the Nazis marched towards the death camps, their primary rationale for the
541920	548640	original implementation of youth in Asia, so to speak, of mass killing was compassionate
548640	553040	youth in Asia. But then I would also say, and this is something we actually don't know,
553520	560080	you know, that the Nazis were national socialists and their political stance was a weird mixture of
560080	565920	what we would think of as left and right-wing now, right? I mean, there was the fascist component
566320	570720	that involved the aggregation of power at the pinnacle, corporate and governmental,
570720	574800	and media, all of that, right? So that seems kind of right-wing and monolithic.
575360	582480	But it wasn't like they were, it wasn't, there were socialist elements in the platform as well.
582480	587200	And so we don't know enough to sort that out, I would say, maybe on the statistical side.
587200	591440	But doesn't all of this sort of point to the fact, or not even the fact, but my contention,
591440	594880	that actually thinking in terms of left and right when it comes to this
594880	597200	is kind of redundant. I think in a way you've sort of hit it.
597200	598320	Yeah, exactly.
598320	602480	Because the debate has always been the struggle between liberty and authority.
602480	606000	And so, you know, to go back to whether I'm left-wing or right-wing, I think I'm probably
606000	609280	just liberal. I think there are liberal-minded people on the left, there are liberal-minded
609280	614240	people on the right among libertarians. It's not something that is tied to a left-right worldview.
614960	620160	But when I hear people talking about how trying to frame the culture war in terms of left and
620160	624240	right, or to say that the culture war doesn't matter and there are more important things,
624240	628240	actually, this struggle between liberty and authority, which John Stuart Mill talks about
628240	633680	in his book on liberty. George Orwell has written about this. That's the thing that matters. And
633680	638800	the recognition that there is an authoritarian impulse in humanity, that there is an enduring
638800	642960	appeal to authoritarianism, whether you come from the left or from the right, this is something
642960	647200	that George Orwell has to go back to. He tackled this as well. It's precisely the reason why,
647200	650960	when he wrote Animal Farm, he couldn't get it published for so long because people were horrified
650960	655440	by the possibility that left-wing people could be authoritarian. And what he was saying is that
655440	663120	this is something that doesn't... It's irrespective of a left-wing view or a right-wing view. And I
663120	666880	think although you might be able to pinpoint psychological differences and tendencies among
666880	671040	those on the left who have an authoritarian bent and those on the right who have a similar
671040	676160	authoritarian bent, perhaps it's more useful just to think, particularly when it comes to the culture
676160	680560	war, in terms of who believes in traditional liberal values. I know that means something very
680560	687280	different in America, but liberal values insofar as individual autonomy, shared humanity, freedom,
687280	693280	freedom of expression, freedom of the press, etc. Those kind of liberal values you can do whatever
693280	697600	you want with your life, so long as it does not impinge upon the rights of others. That's something
697600	704080	that left and right can agree on. And the social justice warriors, whilst they might call themselves
704080	708400	left-wing, really their movement is characterized by authoritarianism. They oppose those liberal
708400	711280	values. Well, that's what it looks like. And quite... Well, not just what it looks like, quite
711280	717280	explicitly. I mean, the early critical race theory texts explicitly say... I mean, if you read Derek
717280	722400	Bell who wrote an essay called Who's Afraid of Critical Race Theory, he talks about how critical
722400	727760	race theorists have always mistrusted liberalism. They see the liberal project as having failed,
727760	734000	because we still live in a society where racism exists. And they take that as evidence that liberalism
734000	739120	doesn't work, rather than... Right, because the previous societies were so non-racist.
739760	746320	Right, exactly. They don't understand that point. The social liberalism is about an ongoing process.
746320	749760	It's about recognizing that we live in an imperfectible world and trying to do our best
749760	756960	with a bad lot. And the problem is that authoritarians tend to be, as well, kind of utopians,
756960	760720	even though in the case of the social justice activists, I don't think they've got a clear
760720	767680	sense of what their final ideal society would look like. At the moment, they just seem to me
767680	774000	to be on a sort of rampage of destruction. Yeah, well, that is what it would look like.
774000	779040	I've always thought that Hitler got exactly what he was aiming at. He shot himself while
779040	784160	Europe was burning. And it's like a big fuck you to God, fundamentally.
784160	789680	Well, that was because he was the personality type that would rather everyone was torn down
789760	792640	rather than he fails. I mean, one of the things that comes in...
792640	795760	Precisely, yeah. Well, that is the dark tetradite, man. That's for sure.
795760	800960	Right. I mean, he was deeply narcissistic. He would ball people with those lectures
800960	807760	late at night when no one was interested. It was all about him. One thing that comes out
807760	812800	very clearly, there's a great biography of Hitler by Ian Kershaw. One thing that very much comes
812800	818560	out about that is this guy was a narcissist. And when he knew that the game was up, he wanted
818560	823200	everyone to pay, all of the German people. That's narcissism right there, man.
823200	825680	That's absolutely right. Well, and he said that, you know? I mean,
826400	831360	at near the end of the Second World War, when the Russians were advancing on Berlin,
832000	838800	he continually expressed his dismay at the uselessness of the German people who had failed him.
838800	844160	Yes, exactly. And those who had failed on the Eastern front or from his perception
844160	847360	had failed, even though he'd put the military in an impossible situation,
847360	852240	couldn't take any responsibility for his own mistakes. But that kind of narcissism,
852240	856480	and I don't like comparing social justice activists to Hitler. I think that's their trick.
856480	860240	That's what they do. They call everyone Hitler. But I think you can definitely see
861040	871760	that combination of narcissism and also a kind of religiosity, intolerance, and yes,
872320	876400	exactly what you say, a desire to destroy. You know, that if we can't get our way,
876400	881360	we'll just destroy everything. Okay, so let's talk about that. I want to use that as a segue,
881360	886000	and I haven't tortured you about having a PhD in Renaissance poetry. We'll get back to that.
886000	890320	I want us to use that as a segue into the religious issue because you wrote a book here recently.
891280	895280	Just make sure I get title exactly right. The New Puritans, How the Religion of Social
895280	902080	Justice Captured the Western World. And so we could talk about religious issues. I've been thinking
902080	909920	recently along the religious lines, let's say, that what we're seeing is just the modern manifestation
909920	916080	of an eternal battle. And that battle is laid out first, very early in the biblical corpus,
916080	923520	in the story of Cain and Abel. Because what you have in that story is two modes of adaptation,
923520	929440	which I think roughly parallel a kind of demented narcissistic authoritarianism and a kind of
930240	935600	responsibility laden individualism. We can discuss that. But what happens is,
935600	941680	Cain and Abel make sacrifices, right? And that's what people do when they work, because work is the
941680	948800	sacrifice of the present to the future. And human beings uniquely work. I mean, maybe beavers work
948800	954960	in bees, but look, essentially human beings uniquely work. We're willing to sacrifice the
954960	961600	present for the future. Now, what happens in the story of Cain and Abel is that Cain appears to make
961600	970480	bloodless and relatively low quality sacrifices, whereas Abel's all in. And the consequence of
970480	976080	that is Abel gets rewarded by God and everyone loves him and things go well for him. And Cain,
976880	983120	nothing goes his way. And then instead of noticing that maybe he has something to do with that,
983120	990000	he calls God out for creating an improper cosmos and really puts him on the stand. And God says,
991120	995600	look, buddy, if you got your act together, things would go well for you. And the fact that they're
995600	1001920	not might have more to do with you than me. And Cain thinks, to hell with you, God, I think I'll
1001920	1007840	go kill your favorite. And so that's the story. And that's one hell of a brutal story. And then,
1008160	1013600	Cain's descendants, including Tubal Cain, which is about four generations down the line,
1014160	1019520	they're the builders of the Tower of Babel and also the first people who make implements of war.
1019520	1023360	So there's an idea there that there's a resentful and bitter,
1024400	1031600	revengeful spirit that preoccupies mankind and that it can spread out from the individual and
1031600	1037680	take out the entire polity. And I can't help but see a reflection of that on the intellectual
1037680	1042560	landscape now in the political domain. Now, I'm curious about what you think about such things,
1042560	1048800	because you have described this new movement, let's say, as religious. So what do you mean by
1048800	1054560	that? What do you think about these more metaphysical speculations? I suppose I should be very clear
1054560	1059680	about that. And in the book, I do make it clear. I've called the book The New Puritans, and I refer
1059680	1063760	to the religion of social justice, because one of the things I'm very keen to do, and one of the
1063760	1069440	reasons why I feel that the critical social justice activists are winning is because a lot of people
1069440	1074400	do not understand their aims, they don't understand what they're about, and that they are effectively
1074400	1079280	fall for the linguistic tricks. I mean, you all know that the culture war is largely about who
1079280	1085120	gets to define the meaning of words. Activists often use words, but they mean the opposite.
1085120	1089280	They call themselves progressive, for instance, but I believe that they are regressive.
1089360	1093600	They call themselves liberal, but they are deeply illiberal. They're in favor of censorship and
1093600	1100320	authoritarianism. They scream about fascism while they themselves are using fascistic tactics,
1100320	1104880	such as violence to silence political opponents. So the language, unless you understand
1104880	1109680	where they're coming from, and unless you understand that theirs is a belief system,
1110960	1117520	which is largely tied to unfalsifiable claims, which depends upon a kind of coterie of high
1117520	1123440	priests, edicts from above, telling the masses what they should believe and punishing those who
1123440	1129360	descend. It has all the hallmarks of fundamentalist religion, at least, the idea of excommunicating
1129360	1134960	heretics, sort of sniffing out heretics, searching for them, and doing the metaphorical
1134960	1138080	equivalent of burning them at the stake, which is what we call council culture,
1138080	1143120	destroying their livelihoods, destroying their reputations, a kind of merciless, brutal,
1143200	1149680	cruel and vicious quality, which nonetheless dons the guise of compassion and righteousness.
1150640	1157760	You know, I'm sure that bullies and innately cruel sociopaths throughout history have probably
1157760	1162320	been attracted to the priesthood, because it gives them the opportunity to have a being,
1162320	1168480	a figure of authority to enact cruelty, and at the same time, to be validated as a principal
1168560	1172880	and important member of society. So I think it does mean like Pharisees and scribes,
1172880	1176560	those sorts of people. Exactly. I'm not suggesting for a second, you know,
1176560	1181040	if you take something as brutal as the Inquisition, I mean, I'm sure a lot of those people involved
1181040	1184000	felt that they were doing God's work and genuinely thought they were on the side of the angels,
1184000	1189760	but you can be damn sure that there were some psychopaths who were attracted to those positions
1189760	1194800	of power. So when I'm saying that I talk about the religion of critical social justice, I'm doing so
1194880	1200240	to try and make it accessible. I've found that if you just, because it is so baffling to everyone,
1200240	1205280	most people are completely baffled because for a start, they have their own kind of esoteric
1205280	1211360	language, this terminology like heteronormativity and toxic masculinity and cisgender, etc. Words
1211360	1216320	that most people just don't even know what they mean. But if you see them as kind of a biblical
1216320	1221520	script or a religious text, and they do have their foundational holy texts such as Foucault
1221520	1226880	and Judith Butler and things like that, if you make this analogy to religion, I think it makes
1226880	1232480	the movement comprehensible. And I think in order to defeat it, it has to be comprehended.
1232480	1238560	And I think most people can't comprehend it. So let's try to get at something that might
1238560	1242800	approximate a definition of religion. So this is how I've been thinking about it technically.
1243760	1248880	So imagine that you see the world through a hierarchy of presuppositions,
1249840	1254000	which you have to because you're fundamentally ignorant. You have to presuppose things in order
1254000	1257760	to move forward because you don't have infinite knowledge. So you have to look at the world
1257760	1263120	through a hierarchy of presuppositions. Then you can imagine that some presuppositions are deeper
1263120	1270000	than others. And what that would mean is some presuppositions very little, very few other
1270000	1276560	presuppositions depend on, and some presuppositions many other presuppositions depend on.
1277520	1282560	Right? Sort of like it's like citation depth in the scientific literature. And so freedom of
1282560	1287760	speech, for example, would be a presupposition in a liberal polity upon which almost all other
1287760	1295200	presuppositions rest. So if you move it, you're moving the depths. So a religion specifies the
1295200	1300880	deepest presuppositions and they have to be axiomatic because that's sort of where your ignorance
1300880	1305280	bottoms out. You have to say, I hold these things to be self-evident before you can proceed.
1305680	1310720	And that is something like the existence of a deity as a presupposition that has to underpin.
1310720	1318400	Right. Okay. So that's the next issue. So Carl, I read a lot of Carl Jung years ago and very deeply.
1318400	1325040	And one of the things Jung said about Protestantism, which I found remarkable, he criticized both
1325040	1331120	Catholicism and Protestantism as a friendly critic, I would say, pointing out that the
1331200	1338640	the temptation that Catholicism might fall prey to is one of centralizing authoritarianism.
1339200	1346960	And the temptation that Protestantism falls prey to is fractionating individualism. He said,
1346960	1352160	the logical conclusion of the Protestant revolution is that every single person becomes their own
1352160	1358080	church. And so it looks to me like that's happened and what's happened. And psychologists have
1358080	1363360	abetted this. And even the great clinicians, I believe, have abetted this regardless of my
1363360	1371040	admiration for them by substituting the self for God. And I think what you have, especially on the
1371760	1378400	psychopathic narcissistic fringes of what used to be the left, and you see this on the right as well,
1378400	1383520	is the momentary self elevated to the status of God.
1384160	1388480	Well, you see that an awful lot, which I think is why, I mean, you've identified the narcissism
1388480	1394320	within these kind of movements, but also the rapidity with which they resort to religious
1394320	1400320	terminology or religious ideas or religious modes of expression, for instance. You remember when
1400320	1405840	them, was it outside of Netflix when they were protesting against Dave Chappelle's show? And
1405840	1411360	there was that comedian protesting with a sign that said, we like Dave or we like jokes. I think
1411360	1417200	they had signs like that. And a one woman cornered him and it was all caught on film. And she screamed
1417200	1423600	repeatedly in his face, repent, mother, she said it again and again and again. And I mentioned that
1423600	1428720	in the book, because I love that that sort of combined that combination of rage and religiosity,
1428720	1433840	I think really encapsulates what the movement is all about. I think in terms of the presuppositions
1433840	1438960	of that movement, which it takes as axiomatic, it's not supernatural. Okay, it doesn't talk about
1438960	1445840	a deity, even though it has its profits, I think, from the French post-structuralist of the 1960s.
1445840	1449920	But I think it does have certain axiomatic presuppositions such as
1450640	1456080	there are power structures that dominate society, that underpinned all human interaction. And these
1456080	1461440	are based on the notion of group identity. And that that is how society needs to be understood.
1461440	1466880	As Foucault talked about grids of power through society, power not being a top down phenomenon,
1466880	1473680	something that sort of is latent within all of our interactions and behavior.
1474400	1479680	And they see that they believe that these activists believe that they can pick this
1479680	1484480	apart and understand it and remedy the wrongs in society, so long as they can identify where
1484480	1492080	the power structures lie and who is exercising privilege at the expense of the oppressed. That's
1492080	1498480	why critical race theorists, I mean, it was put like this in James Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose's
1498480	1504080	book, that the key question that you ask if you are a critical race theory is not a theorist, is not
1505280	1509840	did racism take place in this situation, but how did racism manifest in this situation?
1509840	1510560	Yes, right, right.
1510560	1515600	So it's almost like a ghostly spiritual thing that is always there. I think that's one of their
1515600	1517120	that's one of their major presuppositions.
1517760	1522560	Well, then, well, so here's another way of thinking about that from the religious perspective.
1522560	1530400	I mean, Milton Satan is an authoritarian narcissist and he rules over hell. And so
1530400	1536320	he's a figure that's very much analogous to Mao or to Stalin, right? He's someone who climbs
1536320	1542080	the most pathological possible power hierarchy and then regards himself as a victor even though
1542080	1549920	he's actually the biggest loser. And so, so Satan is the spirit, you might say in the Judeo-Christian
1549920	1558720	tradition, who rules the world by force. Now, the postmodern neo-Marxist types believe that there's
1558720	1565040	nothing but power. So I can't see that that's any different than a certain Christian heresy that
1565040	1570320	rose up in the Middle Ages, making the claim that Satan himself was the ruler of the earth,
1570320	1576560	right? Because the notion there is that power itself is the only or at least the ultimate
1577360	1582000	motivator and, well motivator is the right way of thinking about it. And so, and then
1582880	1587120	it follows a lot of things follow from that, right? One thing that follows from that is that
1587120	1591840	there's no such thing as free speech because there's just conflicts between different claims to power.
1591840	1597680	And that if you promote free speech, that's just an indication of how conniving you are
1597680	1602240	to use that entire philosophical language to do nothing but buttress your own colonialist
1602240	1607040	power claims. Yes, because their theories always put you in that position where you can't win.
1607040	1611040	You know, it's similar with with the critical race theory, they have their notion of interest
1611040	1616880	convergence. You know, when people say, well, there are extremely successful black individuals in
1616880	1620960	our history, Barack Obama, say, someone like that, they will say the only reason that those
1620960	1626400	people have succeeded is because it was in the interests of white people for them to succeed.
1626400	1631280	In other words, if black people don't succeed, right, so if black people don't succeed in society,
1631280	1635040	that's evidence of critical race theorists' claims. But if they do succeed, it's also
1635040	1638400	evidence of their claims because that's interest convergence. So they keep putting you in this
1638400	1646240	kind of situation. That to me has to be religion without, as in religious belief, that has not
1646240	1652480	been, it has merely been asserted rather than proven. The fact that they take on the very
1652480	1656720	notion of rationality, enlightenment ideas, the fact that they think that those things are even
1656720	1660560	part, and they also see that through group identity, that that is just the product of
1660560	1666240	some dead white men in periwigs. President Trump recently issued a warning from his Mar-a-Lago
1666240	1671040	home, quote, our currency is crashing and will soon no longer be the world standard,
1671040	1675920	which will be our greatest defeat, frankly, in 200 years. There are three reasons why the
1675920	1682240	central banks are dumping the US dollar, inflation, deficit spending, and our insurmountable national
1682240	1688000	debt. The fact is, there is one asset that has withstood famine, wars, and political and economic
1688000	1693840	upheaval dating back to biblical times, gold. And you can own it in a tax-sheltered retirement
1693840	1698320	account with the help of Birch Gold. That's right, Birch Gold will help you convert an
1698320	1705200	existing IRA or 401K, maybe from a previous employer, into an IRA in gold. When currencies fail,
1705200	1711440	gold is a safe haven. How much more time does the dollar have? Protect your savings with gold.
1711440	1716160	Birch Gold has an A-plus rating with the Better Business Bureau and thousands of happy customers.

1727440	1733520	So how do you understand this? There seems to be, okay, so we figure we've got a couple of,
1733520	1738240	what would you say, contenders for deity. One would be Satan himself, right, the spirit of
1738240	1742800	power. The other would be the untrammeled hedonic self. It's something like that. But then there's
1742800	1750960	a weird paradox there, not that the paradox bothers the postmodern types, that group identity is
1750960	1760560	paramount, but full, what would you say, full licentiousness on the personal front and the
1760560	1767760	granting of every whim on the personal front is also requisite. And I don't, I can't quite square
1767760	1774560	that coherently. Like, how is it that the radicals can push forward the notion that group identity is
1774560	1780880	the only identity, but also push forward the notion that everything possible is to be permitted every
1780880	1786400	individual at every moment. But you put your finger on it when you said that the paradoxes don't
1787280	1792400	trouble the postmodernists. You know, it's sort of built into their whole idea. When Derrida was
1792400	1798400	writing, he was trying to write incoherently. You know, it's part of it. He did manage. It's
1798400	1807200	absolutely unreadable. So let me try and understand what you're saying here. You were talking about
1807200	1812400	the idea that- Well, we see this worship of the self that emerged. So there's contenders for God,
1812400	1819440	right? We have power and we have the self. And then there's an element of that that spreads out
1819440	1825520	into identity. Now that the radical types definitely put forward group identity as paramount,
1825520	1829680	and yet they worship the self. What do you mean by licentiousness? What do you mean by
1830240	1834080	do they believe that absolutely everything is permissible, that any kind of individual
1835440	1839200	desire is able to be fulfilled? Because in their world, I think they're quite
1839200	1843040	prescriptive, aren't they, about which modes of behavior are acceptable and which aren't?
1843040	1848960	Well, that gets extraordinarily complex because it looks to me, one of the things I see on campuses
1848960	1855680	for example, is the insistence on the left progressive front, let's say, that any form
1855680	1860880	of sexual identity or behavior whatsoever is permissible. And not only permissible,
1860880	1868000	but to be celebrated. But now it's complicated because at the same time, every single interaction
1868000	1874000	between a young man and a young woman is so absolutely dangerous that it has to be subjected
1874000	1881040	to contractual validation before it can proceed. Well, yeah, well, it's a weird psychoanalytic
1881040	1886480	truism, that if you go too far in one direction, you simultaneously go too far in the other.
1886480	1891440	And that really muddies up the water. So the really narcissistic types, for example,
1891440	1897440	have an extremely uncertain core. But that doesn't make them any less, what would you say,
1897440	1902320	forthright in their claims that they should rule. So you can't stretch your, go ahead.
1902800	1909520	Well, I don't, I'm not so sure that it's about fulfilling any indulgence, no matter how depraved.
1910560	1914160	I think it's more about what they call queering society. I think it's more about,
1914160	1922080	if it is in the service of demolishing the cis, white, hetero-patriarchal structures
1922080	1926000	that are in place, then that is seen as a benefit as something positive.
1926000	1930400	Right. So you think that licentiousness serves the purposes of demolition?
1930400	1931040	I do.
1931040	1935360	What about the reverse hypothesis is that, because I would say this might be more
1935360	1942320	true of Foucault, all the demolition was put forward to license the licentiousness.
1943120	1944800	I don't know. I mean, this is real.
1945440	1948560	Yeah, I'm not sure about that. I mean, a lot of people will say that because Foucault has,
1948560	1950640	as you know, a very shady past.
1951520	1952720	Yeah, you might say that.
1952720	1957360	Yeah, absolutely. And people have pointed out that there seems to be a strong correlation
1957360	1963680	between some of the founding postmodernists and, shall we say, well, yeah, depraved sexual
1963680	1968080	activity, sometimes pedophilia, these kinds of things. The question, I suppose,
1968080	1973280	are you suggesting that they created this kind of theoretical framework in order to justify
1974640	1976320	that sort of behavior? Is that what you mean?
1976320	1983760	Well, you see, I waver and maybe the causality is interactive because you could see,
1983760	1990080	I see a lot of stunningly immature behavior on the radical front from a developmental
1990080	1995440	psychological perspective. So, for example, a lot of the behavior I see looks to me like
1995440	2001440	unsocialized two-year-old behavior, because two-year-olds are highly prone to motivational
2001440	2006960	and emotional whims in the short term, and they're incapable of developing a shared frame of
2006960	2012640	reference. That doesn't happen till kids are three. And aggressive two-year-olds who don't
2012640	2017840	develop that by four never develop it in their entire life because they become alienated and
2017840	2024560	they don't make friends and they can't further their development. And so you could say, if this is
2024560	2030640	sort of a Freudian id-like view, that part of what we're seeing is the expression of extremely
2030640	2038000	unsocialized, immature, motivational and emotional demands fragmented with a, what would you say,
2038000	2044800	temper tantrum-like insistence, constant insistence that those whims be granted
2045680	2051520	immediately. And then you could say, well, the entire power critique has been erected by,
2051520	2056960	on the intellectual front, just to justify that. Although you could also reverse it and say, no,
2056960	2061680	the licentiousness, which was the case you were making, the licentiousness is promoted because
2061760	2067680	it's revolutionary in a sense, and it can be used to demolish these so-called traditional power
2067680	2072240	structures. Well, it has to be because they just have so many impositions on other people's freedoms.
2072240	2075760	They have so many ideas of what is acceptable and what is not acceptable, particularly in the arts,
2076480	2082560	in film, in plays, in books, that, you know, they're for censorship. They believe that things that are,
2082560	2086400	that horrible word, they use problematic and they like to problematize things.
2086400	2090640	So it can't be the case that they just believe in a kind of global free-for-all.
2090640	2096160	It can't be that because I think they come across more like Pharisees to me than anything else.
2096160	2099840	But maybe what you're describing in terms of the temper tantrums and the things that we see
2100800	2105760	from these people is that that is just simply the natural consequence of when you have decades
2105760	2110480	of academics and figures of authority saying that we ought to prioritize our emotional responses
2110480	2116320	and our own subjective view of the world over objective epistemological frameworks.
2117280	2121920	Or actual practical responsibility. I mean, I saw this at the University of Toronto. It was
2121920	2127920	one of the things that constantly made me morally ill was that my idiot compatriots thought that the
2127920	2132240	best thing to do with young people was to teach them to protest rather than to help them figure
2132240	2137120	out how to make their way responsibly and productively and generously in the world.
2137920	2143200	They've created a generation that are infantile. I mean, it is an infantilized world and we see it
2143200	2148160	in absolutely every strand of our culture and politics as well. And it's because, as you say,
2149120	2156400	academics, by and large, are activists first and academics second. Helen Pluckrose traces
2156400	2161680	that to what she calls the applied turn of postmodernism, late 80s. Postmodernists for many
2161680	2167040	years were quite enjoyed theorizing and frolicking about coming up with these airy fairy ideas,
2167040	2172320	not applying them to society, not seriously saying we should reconstruct society and apply
2172320	2179520	these methods. And then the applied postmodernist said, actually, we can actually change society,
2179520	2185280	revolutionize society through the application of our untested theories and highly contested theories.
2185280	2193280	And they did it. And what's so tragic is that it eventually worked. We're now in a situation where
2193840	2197760	our government over here, the government certainly in Canada and in the US,
2197840	2204400	they are implementing these ideas, these highly contested theories in public policy,
2204400	2209600	in the educational sense. Yes, they're making the mandatory. Well, that was what propelled me
2209600	2213840	into the public domain to begin with, was the first move of that sort on the Trudeau Liberal
2213840	2220480	Government Front, right, mandated speech. But that's why surely it does merit the analogy with
2220480	2230800	religion, because you are imposing on society ideas that are based on belief, simply based on
2230800	2237600	belief. You know, there is no evidence that reorganizing society in the way that the critical
2237600	2243600	race theories would like to do, so that we have a hyper racialized society that focuses first and
2243600	2248240	foremost on your group of identity and secondarily on who you are as an individual. There's no
2248320	2255200	evidence that this is making society less racist. So we seem to have agreed that
2256400	2265360	the desire for demolition and destruction rules paramount even over the desire for untrammeled
2265360	2274480	personal self-expression. I think that is inevitable when you come from the supposition
2274480	2280400	that society is inherently broken, that it is undergirded by power structures that only
2280400	2287520	support the already privileged. Okay, so let's dive into that, because this is a good place to
2287520	2292960	further interrogate the left issues. So, you know, a lot of the people that I talk with,
2292960	2298480	Russell Brown and Joe Rogan, Brett Weinstein, those are good, Eric Weinstein, those are good
2298480	2308640	initial exemplars, are more classical leftist types, and yet they're identified by the screaming
2308640	2313840	radicals as gateways to the old right, which is extraordinarily interesting, because it means as
2313840	2319920	soon as you're no longer a useful idiot from the radical perspective, you're instantly a Nazi,
2319920	2331360	which is very convenient for them. But here's the thing. The postmodern critique that society
2331360	2339040	is to be understood as nothing but the manifestation of power is attractive, partly because when
2339040	2346640	social arrangements or even psychological arrangements pathologize, they do pathologize in
2346640	2354000	the direction of power, right? So, if you're, you can tyrannize yourself like an overlord,
2354000	2360080	you can tyrannize your partner, you can tyrannize your family and your community,
2360080	2365280	you can act like a tyrant on the local political stage, and then nationally, right?
2365280	2371120	You can do that in business as well. And so, and that happens relatively often. So,
2371840	2379840	there's a core of sense in the claim that power is a powerful motivating force. Now,
2379840	2386480	I think the radicals go too far when they say everything is about power because, well, everything
2386480	2392160	is a lot of things, and you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. But the problem,
2392160	2398480	the problem the left therefore has, if the left is willing to be reasonable and say, well, some
2399280	2404400	social structures are corrupted by power, then the left has to figure out, and can't,
2404400	2411680	because I've asked like 50 senators and Republican and congressmen on the Democrat side to do this.
2412560	2419760	If your leftist stance is that power corrupts society, then how in the world can you tell
2419760	2425840	when those who make that claim take that claim too far? And I've asked, like the reason I brought
2425840	2431840	up the Democrat, the senators and congressmen is because I asked every lefty I could get my hands
2431840	2437920	on, and that's been quite a few over the last five years, when the left goes too far. And I even
2437920	2442480	asked Robert Kennedy that recently, and he said, well, I'm trying to run a campaign based on unity,
2442480	2447520	and so I don't want to go down that rabbit hole. It's like, well, the barbarians are at your gate,
2447520	2453280	buddy. They've been canceling you for 18 years. So, how do we separate out this?
2453280	2456240	Well, there are so many things that you've raised there. I mean, firstly,
2456240	2460480	you're right to identify that there is a kernel in truth of truth in the postmodernist claims,
2460480	2466080	that power is important. It is significant in human behavior and society and history. All of that,
2466080	2470800	that is absolutely accurate. And you're also right that where they go wrong is to assume that
2470800	2474640	everything is about power. Like you say, power is really important, but it's not everything.
2475280	2481520	And I wonder whether reducing everything to just power structures makes things
2482480	2488240	understandable, easier in a way. Yeah, well, we found the best predictor. In our first study,
2488240	2492960	the best predictor of left-wing authoritarianism was low verbal intelligence.
2492960	2499280	Right, because people want easy answers. Absolutely. Power is a good easy answer,
2499280	2506080	right? Any ideology is because it means that you're outsourcing your thinking to a set of rules,
2506080	2511040	and that is what is happening. But that's why all those people that you've tried to ask this
2511040	2516000	question, what happens when the left goes too far in terms of their own megalomania?
2516000	2519520	They won't answer the question because to do so would be to acknowledge that there is a flaw
2519520	2522880	in their ideology. There's a potential flaw in their system, that they're dealing ultimately
2522880	2529600	with human beings. It's the same reason why the Stalinists have never forgiven Orwell.
2529600	2533680	All these people on the left have always hated him for pointing out that the left is just as
2533680	2536880	susceptible to corruption as the right is, and they've never forgiven him for that.
2536880	2540880	And it comes down to that idea of moral purity. I mean, one of the reasons I call them the
2540880	2545600	new Puritans. Again, it's an analogy. It's trying to make them accessible. It's because in their
2545600	2550640	world, to deviate even slightly from this very simplistic formula that they've applied to society,
2550640	2557760	to give them power, ironically enough, to put them in a position where they can control other people,
2557760	2562880	but also can control their own understandings and comprehensions of the world, because they've
2562880	2567680	got this framework through which they can look at it. And to say, well, actually, your framework
2567680	2571360	is flawed in all sorts of ways, that's harder because then you have to start thinking. And they
2571360	2577600	don't want to start thinking. Thinking is the death of ideology. I think that's why you're
2577600	2580960	getting that moral purity, but it's also why. I mean, you mentioned, interestingly,
2581520	2586880	people like Joe Rogan and Russell Brown being considered a gateway to the alt-right. They're
2586880	2592960	still traditionally politically more akin to the left, I would say, than the right.
2592960	2597280	But because they've deviated slightly, you have this kind of puritanical sledgehammer
2597280	2604240	coming down and saying, no, you're straying from what our ideology says you should believe.
2604240	2611200	And that, to me, also feels like a fundamentalist religion. And I'm making the distinction clearly
2611200	2614880	between a religion and a fundamentalist religion, because I think even within Catholicism,
2614880	2618800	the Vatican has always encouraged debate, theological debate and discussion. It's not as
2618800	2624240	though they just give you the catechism and say, that's it. There's all these kinds of discussions
2624240	2628880	and debates and nuances being teased out in theological thoughts. Theologians for centuries
2628880	2634000	have done that. But with fundamentalist religion, that doesn't happen. It doesn't happen with ISIS,
2634000	2638400	for instance. You don't get the sort of leaders of ISIS sitting around cross-legged in their caves
2638400	2642480	saying, well, let's decide whether we're right about this fine theological point.
2642480	2647120	That doesn't happen. So what scares me, I think, about the critical social justice movement,
2647120	2652160	is that they are like a fundamentalist religion for some reason. I mean, this is why, and you know
2652160	2656320	this, whenever you meet one of these people, whenever you encounter them online, get into
2656320	2659440	some kind of discussion, you know what their opinions are and absolutely everything.
2659440	2662800	Yes, yes, yes. Like turning a crank on someone's head.
2663360	2668560	I've never been surprised by them. I'd like to be surprised once in a while. I've had a few
2668560	2672320	occasions recently where I've gotten to conversa... You know, I fall for it. You should just block
2672320	2675520	them, really, because they're not people who can be reasoned with. But every now and then,
2675520	2680480	I take the bait and I say, okay, what is it you think I've said? What is upset you? What is the
2680560	2685680	perspective that I have that you disagree with and why? And they can't do it. They just come back
2685680	2688800	screaming Nazi or whatever, and then you think, okay, well, I shouldn't have bothered trying.
2688800	2694560	But they never surprised me. I just wish they would, because if you're not thinking for yourself
2694560	2698880	and challenging your own ideas, if you're not coming from the basis, from humility, if you're
2698880	2704720	not coming to the world on the understanding that you're probably wrong about an awful lot of things,
2704720	2709280	I don't think you're fully human in a way. I think you're like an automaton. You know, you're just,
2710240	2714640	you're just following a code, a script. You're possessed by a principality.
2715200	2722160	Right. I find that disturbing. Okay, so let me hassle you about something else. I tweeted out
2722160	2730000	at Richard Dawkins here recently, and I talked to Richard Dawkins, and I actually admire Richard
2730000	2735760	Dawkins. I liked his books. They taught me a lot in some of his essays, too. And I think Dawkins
2736320	2741760	is a real scientist in that he believes there is truth and that the pursuit of the truth will set
2741760	2747920	you free, which by the way is a religious claim, but he still believes that. In any case, I also
2747920	2754960	think that Dawkins and Harris and the rest of the new atheists help pave the landscape for this new
2754960	2760480	woke catastrophe, because it's a humanistic movement fundamentally, and it's radically
2760480	2764800	anti-science. And I think that Dawkins, well, I know Dawkins sees that because I've been watching
2764800	2769760	his tweets, and I didn't talk to him. And it's certainly the case that the woke mob, I think,
2769760	2776320	can take out science even more easily than they can take out the vestiges of Judeo-Christian thought,
2776320	2782880	and they're definitely going to do that. So now Dawkins and his coterie looked at
2783440	2788320	the history of the West, and they said, well, we should dispense with that medieval superstition,
2788320	2792320	and we should progress down the Enlightenment trail. And I've talked to Douglas Murray about this.
2792880	2798640	Now, the problem with that, it seems to me, so Jung said something very interesting as well
2799360	2807200	that I'll bring up. He implied that Catholicism, with all its strange mysticism and dream-like
2809360	2815760	propositional structure, was as sane as people got, like that in order for people to
2816560	2821920	function psychologically and to exist together socially, the belief system that united them
2821920	2828960	had to have a dream-like quality. Okay, so and that now the new atheist types would say, well,
2828960	2835920	no, no, no, we can replace all that mumbo jumbo and darkness and occult mysticism with a clear-headed
2835920	2840800	rationality. But what I see happening instead, and this is on the religious front, is that
2841600	2847280	in the aftermath of the death of God, what we've seen reemerge is either a form of worship of power
2847280	2853920	or degeneration into a kind of polytheistic paganism, not a move forward to Enlightenment-type
2853920	2861120	Dawkins rationality. Quite the contrary. And so one of the things I'm curious, I know Murray is
2861120	2867920	uncomfortable about this. Douglas Murray is uncomfortable about this. If the woke movement
2867920	2874480	is a religion, and if it's a dangerous religion, is the alternative to that no religion, or is
2874480	2879600	the alternative to that whatever might constitute genuine religion? And what do you think about
2879600	2885680	that? Well, I think there is clearly something within humanity that we require a certain
2885680	2891120	satisfaction from some kind of belief system, which is outside of ourselves or a sense that
2891120	2894960	there is something beyond ourselves. I suppose you might call it transcendence. I think there is
2894960	2902240	a need for that. I think that I get that through the arts. I think that's why we create things.
2902240	2908480	That's why we are creative beings, which is also why I think the woke movement is threatened by the
2908480	2915040	arts and seeks to curtail it and actually to transform it into just another propagandising tool,
2916320	2921520	because it fundamentally doesn't understand what art is. So it is interesting to me though
2921520	2924400	to have noted that the new atheist movement, the one that you describe,
2924960	2930560	they seem now to have evolved into the most woke of all, the humanist society.
2931280	2937120	Yeah, there's something about them that they bought into gender identity ideology very quickly,
2937120	2942960	probably before other bodies did. And the humanist society in the UK now is fully paid up in that
2943520	2949840	really quasi-religious belief system, the idea of a sexed or gendered soul that doesn't match your
2949840	2956320	biological form. How is that anything other than religious? How is it anything other than
2956320	2962160	supernatural, really? But it has been interesting to me that those were the very people,
2962800	2968320	the people who were talking about rationality and to sort of claw back the primacy of enlightenment
2968320	2972000	values, that they are the ones who've been most susceptible of all. Of course, this is what has
2972000	2980080	got Dawkins in trouble. That's a stunningly devastating observation, because if it turns out
2980080	2986240	that those who wanted to walk down the mass enlightenment pathway, produce children who
2986240	2992960	were most susceptible to woke ideology, that's a pretty damning bit of evidence for the validity
2992960	2999840	of that approach. As far as I mean, I'm trying to look at it. Well, because it's always concerned
2999840	3004640	me that some of my most intelligent friends and acquaintances have fallen for the woke
3004640	3009760	movement. In other words, you talk about the fact that a lot of the activists are very
3009760	3014880	infantile in their behavior, and yet some of the smartest people in society seem to buy into it.
3014880	3022240	It has the capacity to infect everyone, perhaps because it isn't responsive to intellectual
3022240	3029600	rigor. It exists regardless of that. Right, but then that begs the question of why it attracts
3029600	3034560	the intelligent types that you're describing. I mean, look, it originated in the Bloody Academy.
3034560	3039440	It didn't originate. Hypothetically, it originated not only in the academy, but
3039440	3042880	in the core of the academy that was most preoccupied with the humanities.
3044000	3047040	It obviously appeals to the intellect, let's say.
3047600	3058400	Or is it just that we're all, we all have the capacity to fall for hysteria? Is it possible
3058400	3064880	that we're just all, I mean, look, my book opens with a discussion of Salem, The Witch Hunts in
3064880	3070480	Salem. And one of the key things about that, the more I read about it, and the more I was
3070480	3074800	fascinated by the fact that it was these figures in authority, it was the ministers, the judges,
3074800	3079040	it was the highly intelligent in the community who were the ones who were pushing this. I mean,
3079040	3082720	the girls were screaming and crying witch and pointing and saying that the devil was everywhere,
3082720	3086880	and they'd seen people sign the devil's book and all of that kind of thing. I see those girls as
3086880	3091760	analogous with the screaming anime activists online who just shout Nazi everywhere. They see
3091760	3096960	Nazis everywhere. The girls saw witches everywhere. I see that as very, very similar. But it would
3096960	3101280	have gone away if the ministers and the judges said, no, this isn't rational. You're wrong.
3102320	3106960	There's no evidence for your claims. We have to move on. But they didn't. They went along with it.
3106960	3112320	That's why people ended up being executed. It's when figures in authority capitulate
3112320	3117040	to the screaming of the children. You've described the children, the activist has children.
3117040	3121440	The activists themselves, I would posit, are not the problem. If they were all out there with
3121440	3127120	their billboards screaming. It's the enablers. It's the politicians and people in charge.
3127920	3135760	So one of the things you see as the biblical corpus unfolds itself symbolically is an emerging
3135760	3142720	relationship between the figure of Cain. And so that's that bitter figure who's out for revenge
3142720	3147920	and the figure of the, what would you call it, untrammeled intellect. So for example,
3148800	3152960	very rapidly after the Cain and Abel story, you have the story of the Tower of Babel.
3153840	3160480	And what you see there are emperors who are competing to replace God, right? They're building
3160480	3166720	towers that are ever and ever higher predicated on the proposition that they could build a tower
3166720	3172080	all the way to heaven. So that's like Jacob's ladder and thereby replace God. Then you have,
3172080	3180000	you know, the Milton's meditations on Lucifer. Lucifer is the, what the highest angel of God's
3180000	3186480	heavenly kingdom who's gone most wrong. And he's a stellar example of the, of the untrammeled intellect.
3186480	3192000	You know, and I kind of see this in the New Atheist movement too. It's like, we're so smart
3192960	3198880	that our theories can replace the transcendent. Now, your way out of that, I think you just
3198880	3204960	told me, your way out of that is your involvement on the aesthetic front with the arts, right?
3204960	3210640	Well, I think so. Well, there are two, there are two ways. There's also humility. I think,
3210640	3216160	I come back to that point. What you're describing is hubris and that's something which is,
3216160	3219760	which is common, particularly common among intelligent people, I think.
3219760	3224240	Right, right. Absolutely. It's the cardinal sin of the intellect is hubris.
3224240	3234880	Yes, exactly. But yes, the arts, I think are, I suppose, are way out if they are sustained
3234880	3241920	because they, they satisfying that human need to, to understand ourselves and to explore
3242000	3248800	ourselves and to interrogate our existence. It's so important, therefore, that the arts
3248800	3251040	aren't curtailed in the way that they currently are being done.
3251040	3256160	So let me ask you a question about that. I agree with that. I mean, I see that the signal power
3256720	3262320	of beauty, especially manifested in music, for me, speaks of something that's truly transcendent.
3262320	3271040	So here's a question for you. So is there a superordinate unity at which the arts aim?
3271840	3279040	And is that unity not equivalent to the monotheistic spirit? I know this is a major question,
3279040	3281040	right? I'm not, I'm throwing out a major question.
3281040	3281760	It is a major question.
3281760	3287200	Something makes the arts the arts, right? It's their movement towards beauty. What beauty and
3287200	3294000	unity, transcendence, but are the arts unified? Are they, are they the manifestation of a unitary
3294000	3298480	spirit? And I see that unitary spirit is what I think is the antithesis of power.
3299040	3303680	I couldn't profess to know. And I think a lot of people have attempted to define even what
3303680	3309840	art is. And I think people have failed. I've always liked Zola's definition of art as
3309840	3317280	life seen through a temperament. The idea that what the artist does is attempt to present to you
3318160	3324080	his view of the way that he sees the world on the understanding that we all see the world differently.
3324080	3329600	And there is something quite beautiful about that, about expressing ourselves artistically.
3329600	3334480	But it's not just variety. You know, you know, it's not just variety because there are qualitative
3334560	3342240	distinctions between presentations of worldview. So I mean, Dostoevsky, Trump's 50 Shades of Gray,
3342240	3348880	right? Because so there's a hierarchy of rank, right? And the greatest artists occupy the highest
3348880	3354160	rank. And that is what tilts the more towards that transcendent unity, I think. It's something
3354160	3359600	like that. Well, well, yeah, that's absolutely right. It's genius, isn't it? That's how the
3359600	3363680	canon is formed. I mean, the canon is, you know, I think academics like to think that they're the
3363680	3368880	ones who select what is in the canon. The canon is formed through influence, through to what extent
3368880	3375760	other great artists borrow and innovate on the back of other artists. That's that same depth of
3375760	3380720	presupposition that I was describing earlier, right? The more fundamental a text is, the more
3380720	3385360	other texts depend on it. But the reason they do, the reason that artists do that is because obviously
3385440	3393520	people like Michelangelo, Brahms, Dickens, Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, all of these are clearly
3393520	3397840	the pinnacles of human achievement. They're achieving something that most of us simply cannot do.
3397840	3402800	All we can do is look in awe at what they have achieved and other artists look in awe at that
3402800	3407760	and try to come close to it, or at least, or in some cases of extreme genius build upon it.
3408160	3420480	Well, there's a cardinal observation, because the hypothesis that you just put forward is something
3420480	3428880	like the purpose of art is to, what would you say, to provoke the emulation of greatness.
3428880	3434160	And that's based on the hypothesis that there is something transcendent that's great,
3434800	3438880	you know? And that's that unity that I think that the arts are striving toward.
3438880	3442480	Yeah, well, I don't know. I don't think it's conscious like that. I don't think that we...
3442480	3443920	I don't think so either.
3444480	3451840	And all I can say is that artists, I think, great art provokes something of the numinous
3452640	3457840	in us. And whether that's religious or spiritual or godly or whatever, I don't know.
3458400	3459280	But it's something that...
3459280	3462960	Well, I think it is sort of by definition, right? I mean, you know what I mean?
3462960	3466720	It's like, well, if that's not religious, then what is dogma?
3466720	3469120	It's certainly religious on the experiential front.
3469120	3473120	Yes, I suppose what I mean is it doesn't point to the existence of God necessarily.
3473120	3478080	It just points to the existence of something beyond ourselves that we require in order to
3478080	3479280	have a satisfactory life.
3480160	3481760	That sounds a lot like God.
3482560	3483840	Okay, well, that would be...
3483840	3486560	Well, I'm not trying to be picky, you know?
3486560	3489600	Well, that's the thing, man, because it is a matter of definition.
3489600	3494160	You know, like, I don't think God...
3495200	3501120	This transcendent unity that I've been tapping towards here is something like
3502000	3505120	the central animating spirit of mankind at its best.
3505680	3506720	It's something like that.
3506720	3508800	Now, you might say, well, is that real?
3508800	3512800	And that's not a good question because you have...
3512800	3517120	You can't ask that question without bringing an a priori set of presuppositions about what
3517120	3519600	constitutes real to bear on the question.
3519600	3523920	Like, is it the same reality as the materialist atheists claim most real?
3524560	3525440	Probably not.
3526320	3526820	No.
3526820	3528400	But that doesn't mean it's not real.
3528400	3530720	It just means we can't agree on what constitutes real.
3530720	3534000	Well, we can't agree on what constitutes a woman, so that's not surprising.
3534000	3535920	Well, then let's suggest then that...
3535920	3541840	Oh, let's agree that the critical social justice movement is essentially godless.
3541840	3543520	I think it is godless.
3543520	3544400	It doesn't have...
3544880	3548320	It has no yearning after that sense of the numinous,
3548320	3550640	and it has no capacity to produce it.
3550640	3554320	That's why no great art has ever been produced from...
3554320	3559760	Can you name a single woke activist who has produced a great work of art in any
3559760	3561200	medium or any genre?
3561200	3562320	Because I can't.
3562320	3562720	I don't think...
3562720	3564880	Okay, so that's an interesting...
3564880	3566560	That's a very interesting observation.
3566560	3567360	You know, what is it?
3567360	3570400	The gospel statement, by their fruits, you will know them.
3570400	3572400	So if they bear nothing but bitter fruit,
3572400	3577440	then you might think they're worshiping the wrong god, or in your case, they're no god.
3577440	3580720	But right, that was the criticism of the woke types.
3580720	3584240	I think they worship power as a god, but whatever, we're close enough on that,
3584240	3585440	so we don't have to discuss it.
3585440	3591200	So let's talk about the artistic front here, because I see the scientists being mowed down
3591200	3595280	like grass under a lawnmower by the woke activists, and that's going to continue,
3595280	3598080	because the real scientists don't have a political bone in their body,
3598080	3600080	and they have no idea what's coming for them.
3600080	3604880	But I'm particularly sickened by the bloody artists, because the only thing they have to
3604880	3608240	offer is this connection to the truly numinous.
3608240	3610000	That's true across art forms, right?
3610000	3613360	They point to the numinous, and they're willing, increasingly,
3613360	3617920	to subordinate that to ideology order, remain silent in the face of this onslaught,
3617920	3620960	to bolster their moral self-righteousness.
3620960	3621520	Yeah, that's really different for us.
3621520	3623120	They're cutting their own throats.
3623120	3624080	It's horrible to watch.
3624080	3628560	It's horrible to witness, because genius, artistic genius, can only come about by those
3628560	3634480	who can think outside the box, who are not conformists, ultimately.
3634480	3638720	This is a movement that demands conformity, and artists of all people are the ones
3638720	3639520	who are going along with it.
3639520	3641760	Now, to an extent, I suppose, that's always happened, though.
3641760	3644160	I mean, it must have always happened, because people, artists,
3644160	3645520	have to get on with the business of living.
3646400	3650720	Back in my renaissance period, the area that I studied from my doctorate,
3651440	3652560	you had patrons.
3652560	3655520	You had patrons of the arts in society who would effectively say,
3655520	3659120	to William Shakespeare, for instance, when King James patronized William Shakespeare's
3659120	3662240	company, the King's Men, it went from being the Lord Chamberlain's Men to the King's Men,
3662240	3667280	and he said, they were patronized, but Shakespeare could write whatever he wanted.
3668400	3672240	The great patrons are the ones who don't try to steer the artists in a certain way.
3672240	3676640	I mean, sure, you would get, for instance, at the start of Shakespeare's narrative poem,
3676640	3684640	Venus and Adonis, you have this sort of sycophantic passage about the person to whom it is dedicated,
3684640	3690880	Henry Ruthsley, the Earl, and that's because Shakespeare also needed to live at that point.
3690880	3692560	He wasn't yet a rich man at that point.
3692560	3696080	He became very, very rich ultimately, but at that point, he wasn't.
3696080	3705360	So artists do require an income, and in our day and age, in order for an artist to be employed,
3705360	3709600	they have to satisfy a set of demands by the gatekeepers of various industries.
3709600	3716400	That's theatre, the publishing industry, comedy industry, television, executives, commissioners,
3716400	3717360	all of those kind of things.
3717920	3723200	The problem is that at the moment, all of those people are entirely captured by the woke ideology.
3723200	3728560	They are all, it's foot soldiers, or at least even in some cases, I suppose you could call them,
3728560	3729280	it's clergy.
3729840	3732240	And so they make these demands to artists.
3732800	3737680	And I suppose, unless you are independently wealthy, what choice have you?
3737760	3743840	In other words, what this thing does is we can't all be a van Gogh living in complete poverty,
3743840	3745120	doing whatever the hell he wanted.
3745120	3751280	Well, that's a very sympathetic account, and I have some sympathy for that account,
3751280	3757920	because I've seen people, many, many people who've faced the threat of cancellation
3758560	3763280	and are terrified by it, not least often because they have a family to support, let's say.
3764080	3768400	But let me push back on that a little bit.
3768400	3770880	And you tell me if you think there's any flaws in this.
3770880	3782400	Okay, so look, as far as I can tell, your best bet in life is to play the most transcendent,
3782400	3783680	iterable strategy.
3784560	3787920	And because you're going to pay a price for what you do, no matter what you do.
3787920	3791440	You're going to pay, in fact, you're going to pay the ultimate price, no matter what you do.
3791440	3793920	So you're already screwed in the fundamental analysis.
3794480	3799840	Now, and that means that you're, the fact that you're going to pay means that you're always
3799840	3801120	confronted with a choice.
3801120	3806240	And the choice is to say what you believe to be true and take the consequences,
3806240	3810400	or to fail to say what you believe to be true and take the consequences.
3810400	3816640	Now, people will say, well, I don't want to speak right now because look at the consequences.
3816640	3819920	And I would say, well, that's always why people have lied throughout history,
3819920	3823520	is to avoid the consequences or to get something they don't deserve.
3823520	3828640	And so I could say, from the judgment perspective, rather than the mercy perspective,
3828640	3833120	especially to artists, it's like, I don't give a damn about your financial need.
3833120	3837680	The only thing you have to offer the world is the purity of your vision.
3837680	3842000	And if you sacrifice that while you're killing the goose that lays the golden eggs,
3842000	3846400	and you might be protected in the short term, but they're going to come for you in the future.
3846400	3848800	There may be a lot of these creative people are thinking to themselves,
3848800	3852560	I will play the game as far as I need to, so that I can establish myself,
3852560	3854560	and then I can make my own artistic choices.
3854560	3855680	That's how many times- Yeah, right.
3855680	3858080	Doesn't work. That's what the faculty did.
3858080	3862720	They said over and over as they rose up the ladder from graduate student to professor.
3862720	3866000	Well, once I have tenure, I'll be brave.
3866000	3867680	It's like, that isn't how it works.
3867680	3869920	You don't get braver because you're more pretentious.
3869920	3873760	Okay, so you didn't do that, so why didn't you do it?
3874480	3880000	Look, I completely share your sense of dismay, and particularly from artists.
3880000	3885120	You know, I think the world of academia is rather more careerist, I think.
3885120	3889760	And so, although I think it's just as unforgivable, it's more understandable.
3889760	3896480	I think to be an artist, you have to be the kind of person whose soul fealty is to your muse.
3896480	3897360	It has to be that.
3897360	3900160	Otherwise, you're not really an artist in any serious sense at all.
3900160	3905040	You have to be creating what it is you are personally impelled to create, whatever drives you.
3905760	3909280	And you know, there are some people who have done that in history.
3909280	3915040	William Blake was poor throughout his life, died in poverty,
3915040	3920080	and he could see all these mediocre people playing the game and becoming rich,
3920080	3921600	but he couldn't do it.
3921600	3923360	He was too much of an authentic artist.
3924560	3925920	He wasn't able to do that.
3926720	3928880	And I wish all artists could have that.
3928960	3933280	But the other thing about that is actually very few people are great artists.
3933280	3939360	Most people are sort of peddlers of popular culture or, you know, kind of functional hacks
3939360	3943920	that people can produce the entertainment that actually we do really need and require.
3943920	3945840	Like, I'm not trying to denigrate popular culture.
3945840	3946960	I think it's really, really important.
3946960	3949440	But it's not the same as great art, right?
3949440	3955440	So pop music, I really enjoy pop music, but I don't pretend to myself that it's Brahms.
3955440	3957920	You know, we have those hierarchies.
3957920	3960400	Hierarchies, by the way, which the woke would like to tear down and say,
3960400	3964800	that's all about the implementation of power again and the implement implementation of privilege.
3964800	3967200	They will say there's no difference between a...
3967200	3968800	There's no such thing as quality.
3969600	3970960	No, no, no, exactly, exactly.
3970960	3972480	Because it's all about subjective feeling.
3972480	3977040	And they would say that there's no difference between an Elton John song and a Beethoven symphony.
3977040	3978160	They'll say there's no difference there.
3978160	3982400	It's just about, you know, and to pretend that there is is a problem in and of itself.
3982400	3984720	And that's why I think there are two things.
3985280	3987840	The way that artists could really be supported in this
3988000	3992560	partly comes from academia, partly comes from literary theorists
3992560	3995440	and people who, by the way, I think have completely lost the plot.
3995440	3999200	But they need to retain the primacy of the canon, of the Western canon.
3999200	4004480	They need to say, actually, there are certain works of art that are greater than others.
4004480	4006960	They need to be able to be bold enough to say that.
4006960	4014400	Rather than stripping away Chaucer or Shakespeare or Marlowe or whatever from the canon
4014400	4019600	to make way for mediocre writers who happen to represent a marginalized group identity.
4020560	4026000	Well, I see in that, again, this re-emergence of the spirit of Cain.
4026000	4030560	Because Cain, imagine you're a mediocre artist, want to be.
4030560	4034080	And part of the reason for that maybe isn't so much that you're talentless,
4034080	4035680	although that might have something to do with it,
4035680	4040080	but that you're unwilling to say a true word or to paint a true brush stroke.
4040080	4042480	You're too cowardly, so you're not going anywhere.
4042480	4045600	Okay, so you're getting irritated and resentful
4045600	4048640	because your sacrifices aren't being appreciated by God.
4049280	4050240	And so what do you do?
4050240	4053680	Well, if you're Cain, you destroy your own ideal, right?
4053680	4056480	Because that's what Cain says to God,
4056480	4058320	my punishment is more than I can bear.
4059120	4060880	Now, that's a very ambiguous phrase,
4060880	4062960	because you can't tell exactly what it refers to.
4062960	4065520	But as far as I can tell, what he means is,
4066240	4070640	well, I've really spent my whole life miserable and jealous because I'm not able,
4071520	4073760	and I want to be more than anything else.
4073760	4076560	And now I've gone and killed my own ideal.
4076560	4080240	And so how can I live? I've killed my own ideal.
4080240	4085120	Well, that's what these bloody woke artists want to be types are doing.
4085120	4087520	It's not just even the woke, this predates the woke.
4088080	4091440	Harold Bloom used to, the great literary theorist used to write about
4091440	4095040	the critical theorists, the identitarian theorists of the 90s
4095040	4097200	as being the theorists of resentment.
4097200	4098560	That's what he called them.
4098960	4100640	I think that's exactly right.
4100640	4104720	It started way back in the 60s with feminist writers trying to problematize
4104720	4108480	writers such as D.H. Lawrence or Norman Mail or whoever it might be,
4108480	4112240	Ernest Hemingway, whatever, saying that these writers are sexist.
4112240	4115600	I mean, when I was studying as an undergraduate for English literature,
4116160	4119120	you basically got the highest marks if you problematized texts.
4119120	4123760	If you went through a play and teased out the homophobic elements or the racist elements,
4123760	4126880	you'd get rewarded almost like you were kind of a kind of moral detective.
4127440	4128800	And I think it all started there.
4128800	4129840	It goes way back to the past.
4129840	4132480	Well, so then I would say that's part of the
4133520	4135360	prideful hubris of the intellect.
4135360	4140480	So you have these second rate creative wannabes in English departments, let's say.
4141360	4144000	And instead of worshiping the spirit of Shakespeare,
4144000	4147280	which is what they should properly be doing and transmitting that to students,
4147840	4152640	they elevate their critical capacity over and above the creative capacity of the artist,
4153360	4156160	lay moral claim to the integrity of their arguments,
4156160	4161600	and then propagandize to the students who pay $50,000 a year for the privilege.
4161600	4164960	Which is why I go back to humility, because I think the only sensible
4164960	4168720	or intelligent approach to Shakespeare is humility.
4168720	4171200	Similarly, you know, when we saw recently the publishing house,
4171200	4175520	which publishing house was it that decided to rewrite P.G. Woodhouse's novels?
4175520	4179360	P.G. Woodhouse is the greatest comic prose stylist in the English language.
4179360	4185200	The idea that a group of 20-something activists in a publishing house think that
4185280	4187040	they can write better than Woodhouse,
4187040	4191120	think that they can improve his work by this sort of horrendous, bolderized version.
4191120	4192160	Especially morally.
4193200	4195120	Of course morally, it's all based on morals.
4195120	4197360	So it's so infuriating.
4197360	4201120	I mean, it makes me very, very angry because it's the arrogance of that
4201840	4204240	that I find absolutely stunning.
4204240	4206480	But similarly with productions of Shakespeare, so there's...
4208960	4211840	I just saw a review the other day for a production of Julius Caesar
4211840	4213440	by the Royal Shakespeare Company.
4213440	4215920	By all accounts, it's just an identitarian mess.
4215920	4221120	It's just taking the play and just reshaping it to promote
4221120	4224880	vogue-ish ideas that are in fashion at the moment
4224880	4228640	about group identity and the primacy of group identity and power structures, etc.
4228640	4230720	And therefore they're missing the entire play.
4230720	4235200	And as an audience member, this is why I think it's better to read Shakespeare at this point.
4235200	4241120	Because as an audience member, you are subject to whatever interpretation
4241120	4242720	the director wants to impose on it.
4242720	4246000	And if that director is really a preacher in disguise,
4246000	4248320	then you're just going to get a sermon, not a play.
4249120	4251040	That seems to me what's happening over and over again.
4251040	4254480	I saw today, actually, there was an article about Macbeth.
4256800	4257840	Trigger warning.
4257840	4260400	It's a trigger warning on Macbeth at the University in Belfast,
4260400	4262400	at Queen's University in Belfast, right?
4262400	4265680	Now, those people are studying a module on Shakespeare.
4265680	4267360	And it's actually even a secondary module.
4267360	4270160	They already have a decent knowledge of the subject.
4270160	4276400	This is like an advanced module where they are to really get into the weeds with this great writer.
4276400	4278960	And to put a trigger warning in that is to say
4280080	4283280	that the way that we need to perceive these great texts
4283280	4287600	is through our particularly obsessive, moralistic,
4287600	4291920	identitarian lens, and that we have to see them as morally dangerous texts,
4291920	4293760	potentially dangerous texts, toxicity.
4293760	4296160	Maybe they're exactly right on that front.
4296160	4298240	Because if you are a woke propagandist,
4298240	4301600	there is nothing more dangerous to you than the spirit of Shakespeare.
4301600	4303600	Sure. And there is something dangerous, actually,
4303600	4306720	particularly about Macbeth, I think, because in Macbeth,
4306720	4310160	I mean, I think Macbeth is one of Shakespeare's greatest plays.
4310160	4313120	And I think one of the reasons why I always found it disturbing,
4313120	4316400	even as a child, even though I didn't really know why I found it disturbing as a child,
4316400	4318240	because it's one of those that gets on school text,
4318240	4319280	because it's such a short one.
4319840	4322800	But actually, when you watch it, it isn't like you're...
4323280	4328880	Shakespeare created so many great embodiments of evil,
4328880	4332480	people like Yago in Othello, or Edmund in King Lear,
4332480	4334640	or Aaron in Titus Andronicus, these figures.
4335200	4337680	But Macbeth is different, because with Macbeth,
4339040	4342800	you go along with Macbeth knowing that it could be you.
4342800	4344320	I think it's the closest to what...
4344320	4347440	When you write about Solzhenitsyn talking about
4347440	4350080	the line of good and evil cutting through the heart of every man,
4350080	4351520	that to me is Macbeth.
4351520	4356080	Because Macbeth is like this incredible representation of,
4356080	4358240	what if we lived in a world where we didn't have free will?
4358880	4361360	Macbeth knows everything he is doing is wrong,
4361360	4362880	and cannot stop it from happening.
4363520	4365760	And it's like when you're watching it,
4365760	4367440	if you're watching a good production of Macbeth,
4368560	4370400	you are Macbeth, right?
4370400	4372160	And you're falling into this vortex.
4373920	4374480	That's why I think...
4374480	4378080	Well, that's actually like a definition of great literature.
4378080	4382640	I think literature almost always portrays something like
4382640	4386240	a romantic adventure, and then something like
4386240	4388000	the battle of good against evil,
4388000	4390240	depending on how that's laid out, right?
4390240	4392480	It's a romantic battle of good against evil.
4392480	4396720	Okay, but the great literary authors
4397360	4401040	place that battle in the soul of a single individual, right?
4401040	4404640	So that each character contains the entire landscape
4404640	4405760	of the cosmic battle.
4405760	4409120	Instead of there being some characters parsed out as good,
4409120	4411600	and other characters parsed out as villainous.
4411600	4414000	And so then when you sit in the audience,
4414560	4416640	and you experience that,
4416640	4420000	you're experiencing the divine drama in your own soul.
4420000	4422160	Yeah, and that is distilting, right?
4422160	4424080	Let me throw you something at you.
4424080	4428800	So I went to Jerusalem with Jonathan Pazio,
4428800	4432560	and Pazio is about the deepest religious thinker I ever encountered.
4432560	4435040	And he was a postmodernist for a good while,
4435040	4437280	and so is expert in that domain as well,
4437280	4439600	which makes him a particularly vicious critic now
4439600	4442240	of the postmodernist types.
4442240	4445920	Anyways, we walk the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem.
4447040	4453200	And what that is, so if you imagine a tragic story,
4453200	4454400	then you embody that.
4454400	4457920	And the ultimate tragic story is the worst possible thing
4457920	4460480	happening to the best possible person, right?
4460480	4465280	That's the pinnacle towards which all tragedy strives,
4465280	4466240	you might say.
4466240	4471360	And walking the Via Dolorosa is an exercise in literary experience.
4471920	4475840	Because the point of that pilgrimage, so to speak,
4475840	4481120	is to place yourself not only in the role of the recipient
4481120	4482720	of all that brutality,
4482720	4486560	but also in the role of the deliverer of the brutality, right?
4486800	4491440	Imagine yourself as the mob, as yourself as the best friend
4491440	4496800	who betrays, as the intellectually hubristic Pharisee
4496800	4499760	and scribe, as the hapless ruler of Rome.
4499760	4501040	That's all you.
4501040	4503680	And that's what literature does, it walks you through that.
4503680	4508720	And I think Macbeth and Macbeth and plays of that magnitude
4509440	4514640	are threatening to the woke types, most particularly,
4514640	4520400	because they do require that pilgrimage of moral inquiry.
4520400	4523040	And that does upset the ideological apple cart.
4523040	4524480	So they hate art, they hate art,
4524480	4526880	because it pushes past propaganda always.
4526880	4528960	Exactly, and that's why the passion of the Christ
4528960	4532400	is the most powerful story and the most enduring story,
4532400	4536240	not story, but account of the brutality that we...
4536240	4538720	I mean, when you read about the experience of Jesus
4538720	4541440	on the way to Calvary, can any of us be sure
4541440	4543440	that we wouldn't be among the jeering mobs
4543440	4544080	throwing the stones?
4544080	4545600	No, we can be sure we would be.
4545600	4547680	We can be certain we would be.
4547680	4549200	The woke don't agree with that, do they?
4549200	4551920	Because the woke like to judge the past,
4551920	4555920	and they will say that if I had lived in the antebellum south,
4555920	4557360	if I had lived in the Civil War,
4557360	4559200	I would have been the ones trying to free the slaves.
4559200	4560400	I wouldn't have been a slave owner.
4560400	4562320	I wouldn't have been one of those people
4562320	4565280	who supported racial segregation.
4565280	4566400	But of course they would.
4566400	4567760	And in fact, they would have been the first ones.
4567760	4569600	So, okay, so let's...
4569600	4571600	All right, so I've been thinking
4571600	4575200	about this mythological motif of the harrowing of hell.
4576640	4580240	So what happens in this ultimate tragedy
4580240	4582000	is that, well, first of all,
4582000	4584640	the best possible person is put to death
4584640	4587360	by the worst possible people in the worst possible way.
4587360	4589840	And you might think, well, that's as bad as it gets.
4589840	4590080	Right?
4590080	4593120	Because sort of by definition, that's as bad as it gets.
4593120	4595440	But you know, that isn't as bad as it gets.
4595440	4598080	And that's pretty awful because, you know,
4598080	4599600	you just pointed to something
4599600	4600880	is that if you're looking at history
4600880	4602480	and you have any bloody sense,
4602480	4605120	you think, I wouldn't have been a victim or a hero.
4605120	4606560	I would have been a perpetrator
4606560	4608240	because most people were perpetrators.
4608240	4610880	Although, you know, there were plenty of victims.
4610880	4612240	I would have been a perpetrator.
4612240	4613760	And so then when you realize
4613760	4616240	that you likely would have been a perpetrator
4616240	4620240	and that you probably are at the moment unbeknownst to yourself,
4620240	4622000	well, then you're facing something,
4622000	4624400	I think, that is in some ways worse than death.
4624400	4625760	I think it's hell.
4625760	4628800	I actually think that is that you have to understand
4628800	4632080	that there is a part of you that would willingly dwell in hell
4632080	4634480	before you can rescue yourself from it at all.
4635040	4636880	You know, and I think that's what we're called to do
4636880	4638720	in the aftermath of the 20th century
4638720	4641680	and the horrors of Auschwitz to wake up and think,
4641680	4643360	oh my God, there's something inside us
4643360	4646320	that's so malevolent that to gaze upon it for a second
4646320	4648800	is to suffer for nightmares from nightmares
4648800	4650160	for the rest of your life.
4650160	4652480	But that that's also your moral obligation.
4652480	4654880	And that seems to me what the harrowing of hell is, right?
4654880	4656960	It's the descent through death
4656960	4659040	into the realm of malevolence itself
4659040	4661440	and to take that onto yourself.
4661440	4664800	So when the woke try to police art,
4665440	4670160	apply trigger warnings to art, censor it, remove scenes, et cetera,
4670720	4674880	are they, in your view, attempting to prevent that experience,
4674880	4678240	that necessary human experience of confronting
4678240	4679920	the worst possible version of yourself?
4679920	4681200	Is that what they're doing?
4681200	4682960	That's what it looks like to me.
4682960	4685280	I mean, I think they're protecting themselves
4685280	4687360	from chaotic complexity,
4687360	4689840	but that also denies them possibility.
4689840	4691680	So that's terrible and hope.
4691680	4693280	But more importantly,
4693280	4696560	they're trying to shuffle off the responsibility
4696560	4698560	of confronting Satan in the desert.
4698560	4699520	So there's something,
4699520	4701520	well, I mean, there's something quite understandable
4701520	4702400	about all of that, isn't there?
4702400	4704560	Because it is uncomfortable.
4704560	4707280	I mean, people have done this with the arts forever.
4707280	4709280	When, I mean, one of the most interesting things
4709280	4711200	I think about King Lear, for instance,
4711200	4712560	the Shakespeare's King Lear,
4713120	4717600	is that that was not the, after 1680, roughly 1680,
4717600	4719760	his version wasn't on the stage anymore.
4719760	4722240	It was rewritten by a guy called Neham Tate.
4722240	4723600	And that was the version of King Lear
4723600	4725840	that was on the stage for 150 years.
4725840	4728880	And in that version, you have a happy ending.
4728880	4730720	You don't have Lear come in,
4730720	4733680	cradling his daughter who's been hanged,
4734240	4736880	because they couldn't cope with that.
4736880	4737760	They couldn't cope.
4737760	4739760	And it's not just, it's not just,
4739760	4741600	because I think King Lear, of all his plays,
4742160	4743600	really represents this complete baron.
4743600	4744400	I mean, it is baron.
4744400	4745680	It's pre-Christian.
4745680	4746560	It is godless.
4746560	4750240	It's this society where exactly what you describe,
4750240	4754320	the best type of person has the worst possible experience.
4754320	4755440	In spite of what critics have said,
4755440	4758960	Lear is meant to be much loved, a great ruler,
4759840	4763360	who is subjected to this endless cruelty
4763360	4766000	that ultimately ends in an unbearable moment.
4766000	4768720	The unbearable moment is Cordelia coming in dead.
4769520	4770800	His fall has been hanged.
4771440	4773760	It is complete nihilism.
4775040	4777920	This is a play that makes you think,
4777920	4779280	what if there was nothing else?
4779280	4780640	What if there was no god?
4780640	4782800	What if being good didn't matter?
4782800	4785280	What if the very worst things happened to the best?
4785280	4786400	And they couldn't handle it.
4786400	4789040	So the Neham Tate version was what people went to see.
4789040	4791440	And in the end, Cordelia gets married to Edgar.
4791440	4792400	And it's a happy ending.
4792960	4794720	And although that seems like a travesty to us,
4795600	4797280	it actually makes sense to me as well.
4797360	4801120	It makes sense why audience goers didn't want to confront that.
4801680	4802240	Why would they?
4802240	4805840	Well, I don't think they would,
4805840	4808080	but I think the horrible truth might be that
4808640	4811200	the only way to paradise is through death and hell.
4811840	4812320	Right.
4812320	4815840	And that's like, I'm not saying that with any degree of satisfaction,
4815840	4816640	but I don't see it.
4817360	4819200	Because look, one of the things I tried to do,
4819840	4822560	I took my studies of Auschwitz in particular,
4822560	4824880	but also the Gulag really seriously.
4824880	4826000	I was trying to figure out
4828000	4828640	what I could do.
4828640	4831600	Well, I tried to put myself in the position
4831600	4834320	of an Auschwitz camp guard who kind of enjoyed his job.
4835760	4836000	Right.
4836000	4839200	And the horrible thing is you can put yourself in that position.
4839200	4841200	And the horrible thing about that is you discover
4841200	4843920	all sorts of things about yourself there by doing so
4843920	4846320	that you pretty much wish you never discovered.
4846960	4850400	But the upside, and I suppose this is the redemptive upside,
4850400	4853760	is that if you recognize within yourself
4853760	4856240	the source of all malevolence and evil,
4856240	4858880	if you can actually do that, if you'll look at that,
4858880	4860480	then you can transcend it.
4860480	4862080	But there's no other way.
4862080	4863200	There's no pretense.
4863200	4866160	And so I've been terrified of this for decades.
4866160	4867840	It's what I taught my students at Harvard
4867840	4869120	and at the University of Toronto.
4869120	4871760	I said, you have to take upon yourself
4871760	4873440	the sins of the perpetrator in order
4873440	4875840	to rectify the catastrophe of the Holocaust.
4876480	4878400	You know, weirdly and perversely,
4878400	4881680	the leftist radicals in some demented way
4881680	4883360	are insisting upon that, right?
4883360	4884960	They say, well, the problem is,
4885040	4889200	is they put the onus on the souls of other people.
4889840	4891760	They say, well, look, you powerful people,
4891760	4894960	you white people, you privileged group people,
4894960	4896160	you're the perpetrators.
4896160	4898880	It's like, no, god damn it, you're the perpetrator.
4898880	4900800	It's really hard, though, for them to put themselves
4900800	4902960	in that position and for them to confront
4903920	4906480	that aspect of their own soul, if we want to call it that.
4906480	4908080	Yeah, it's the hardest thing.
4908080	4909360	It's the hardest thing.
4909360	4912400	But also, they can't do it because they don't recognize
4912400	4914320	their own behavior for what it is.
4914320	4916960	They don't see that they are the cruelest of the cruel.
4916960	4919360	They don't see that they are themselves
4919360	4921520	capable of all sorts of monstrosities
4921520	4923120	because I've seen the way they behave.
4923120	4924480	Well, it also might be, Andrew,
4924480	4926240	that they don't see anything like,
4927920	4931040	something has to, okay, I always believe
4931040	4932720	that if you understood something,
4933840	4935520	you could find your way forward.
4935520	4936640	Like, I would say that's,
4936640	4938560	and I think my father helped me with that
4938560	4939920	in some deep way, right?
4939920	4941680	He instilled that in me in some way.
4941680	4942800	I don't really understand.
4943440	4945600	And I've always been convinced of that.
4945600	4950800	And so one of the consequences of that
4950800	4953840	is the idea that, well, if you can take it
4953840	4957200	upon yourself to gaze into the abyss,
4957200	4959360	let's say as deep as you possibly can,
4959360	4961280	that what you will see eventually
4961280	4963280	if you look hard enough is the light.
4963280	4964880	But you know, you have to believe
4964880	4966720	that the light is a possibility, right?
4966720	4969200	And maybe that's the fundamental axiom
4969200	4972000	of an appropriate faith, is the light is a possibility.
4972080	4974320	And if all you believe is that power rules,
4974880	4977200	well, how can you look upon evil without despair?
4977840	4979760	And what are the consequences for humanity
4979760	4981600	if you have a ruling ideology
4981600	4983360	that doesn't enable any of us
4983360	4984960	to have that experience anymore?
4984960	4985600	Because that seems to me to be also-
4985600	4987200	Well, we know what the consequences
4987200	4988880	we saw in the 20th century.
4989440	4989760	Right.
4990560	4991280	Right?
4991280	4992400	Many, many times.
4993680	4996240	Well, I suppose then, it's not too alarmist
4996240	4997840	to say that that's where the woke are leading us.
4998480	4999120	Certainly the spiritual.
4999120	5000400	That's what it looks like to me.
5000400	5006160	Well, no comedy, no art, no literature, right?
5006160	5011520	No science, no free speech, no redemption from guilt.
5012080	5012400	Yes.
5012400	5014240	No genuine individual identity,
5014240	5016000	no up, no down, right?
5016000	5020880	Just a desert of barren endeavor, right?
5020880	5021200	Yes.
5021200	5023360	With maybe some impulsive hedonism
5023360	5024480	thrown in now and then to-
5025040	5028400	And yet they would deny everything you've just said.
5028400	5030240	They would deny every claim that you're making there.
5030320	5032960	They would say they're not trying to do any of that at all.
5032960	5034560	That they want to preserve art.
5034560	5036160	They want free speech to flourish.
5036160	5038800	They just want to protect marginalized communities
5038800	5039520	within that.
5039520	5040960	That would be their argument.
5042000	5042640	So it's very difficult to combat.
5042640	5045680	Yeah, well, the marginalized community argument
5045680	5047120	is a very interesting one too.
5047120	5048640	I've been trying to work that through,
5048640	5049840	especially with Pajot.
5050480	5052800	You know, and he helped me walk through
5052800	5055120	the idea of the center and the fringe
5055120	5056320	in the biblical corpus.
5056320	5059440	And so there's an idea, for example,
5059520	5065600	in the ancient geography of the ancient Israelite times,
5067040	5070400	the poor were allowed to glean on the edges of the fields.
5072000	5072320	Right?
5072320	5075840	So there was a border of uncertainty around,
5077280	5078240	what would you say?
5078240	5080240	Around a demarcated territory.
5081040	5083200	And that border of uncertainty was where
5084240	5086560	the marginalized were allowed to thrive.
5086800	5088720	And so there does have to be a center,
5088720	5089920	and there has to be a margin.
5089920	5092240	But if you bring the margin to the center,
5092240	5094800	you destroy the center, and you destroy the margin.
5095680	5098880	And that's partly why I don't buy the postmodern claim
5098880	5101200	that it's compassion that's driving
5102000	5103680	the centering of the marginalized,
5103680	5107280	because that's a serpent that eats its own tail.
5107280	5109280	And I think what we're seeing happen right now
5109280	5112320	on the LGBT front is that the fringe of the fringe
5112320	5114000	is devouring the fringe.
5114640	5119280	Faster than the center even, because you know that most of the kids
5119280	5123200	who are surgically transitioned would have been gay.
5123200	5125280	It's 80%, right?
5125280	5127120	So that's pretty damn interesting.
5128480	5130480	Well, that might be the thing that breaks it apart.
5130480	5132080	I wonder if that's the thing that breaks it apart,
5132080	5136800	because there is now a schism within this LGBTQIA2S+,
5138080	5140080	whatever you want to call it, community,
5140080	5141200	which doesn't exist anyway.
5142160	5144080	And the schism is precisely what you described,
5144080	5146080	which is that gender identity ideology
5146640	5151920	is not just a fanciful theory,
5152960	5155280	a quasi-religious way of viewing the world.
5155280	5157280	It's also actively anti-gay.
5157280	5161040	And so far as it does suggest,
5161040	5163440	well, firstly, it denies homosexuality,
5163440	5166400	because homosexuality and gay rights have always been predicated
5166400	5168560	on the recognition that a minority of people
5168560	5170320	are attracted to members of their own sex.
5171200	5174400	It eliminates that by saying there's no such thing as same-sex attraction,
5174400	5178000	and that actually you should be attracted to gender or gender identity.
5178000	5181760	This is why Stonewall, which is the UK's foremost LGBT charity,
5181760	5184960	redefined the word homosexual on their website
5184960	5187920	to say it's same gender attracted.
5187920	5191120	I wrote an article recently about this, and I mentioned Nancy Kelly.
5191120	5193600	Non-women being attracted to other non-women.
5193600	5194080	Right, oh my goodness.
5194080	5195200	No, non-men.
5195200	5197280	Non-men being attracted to other non-men.
5197280	5198400	That was great, man.
5198400	5200400	That's the definition of lesbian now is non-men.
5200960	5202320	They're attracted to non-men.
5202320	5203440	It's unbelievable.
5203440	5206480	And Nancy Kelly, the CEO of Stonewall,
5206480	5210560	has said that women who want to exclude biological men
5210560	5212880	from their dating pool are sexual racists,
5212880	5214400	or akin to sexual racists.
5214400	5215520	Well, that's the logical.
5215520	5216720	That's the logical.
5216720	5220960	I said this five years ago in a discussion I had at Queen's University.
5220960	5224480	It's like, well, you don't think discrimination is right.
5224480	5225440	No, we don't.
5225440	5227120	Well, how about sexual discrimination?
5227120	5228720	Should you just lay down on the ground
5228720	5231280	and spread your legs for every comer, so to speak?
5231840	5234400	Because you're certainly being discriminatory if you don't.
5234400	5236080	Like, really, like, fundamentally,
5236080	5239040	that is the most egregious form of discrimination.
5239040	5240000	They're right about that.
5240000	5240400	Absolutely.
5240400	5242240	A sexual orientation is a form of discrimination.
5242240	5244880	Like, she says you're like a sexual racist
5244880	5246320	if you don't want to sleep with someone with a penis
5246320	5247120	and you're a woman.
5247120	5248480	No, you're just homosexual.
5248480	5250080	She's describing homosexuality there,
5250080	5252640	but she's saying that homosexuality is itself bigoted.
5253680	5255600	And that's coming from the head of the gay rights,
5255600	5257520	the foremost gay rights charity in this country.
5257520	5258480	That's insane.
5259280	5260560	The inversions are incredible.
5260560	5264880	You know, when I was at school, the kids who were effeminate,
5264880	5266160	the boys who were effeminate,
5266160	5268000	who didn't want to play football and all the rest of it,
5268560	5270080	the bullies called them girls.
5270080	5270960	They said, you're just girls.
5270960	5272080	You're not even a proper boy.
5272080	5273280	You're not a real boy.
5273280	5276160	That's what Mermaids and Stonewall says now.
5276160	5277680	They say, that's what the Tavistock was doing.
5277680	5280240	They're saying, you're basically probably trapped in the wrong body.
5280240	5281360	Let's fix you.
5281360	5284080	Like you say, between 80 and 90% of adolescents
5284080	5286400	referred to the Tavistock Clinic are same-sex attracted.
5286400	5287760	Well, that's what they do in Tehran.
5288400	5290640	That's the head of gender transformation,
5290640	5292400	sex transformation surgery in the world.
5292400	5294560	Which is really quite something.
5294560	5298640	The mothers in Tehran and the heads of Stonewall are peas in a pod.
5298640	5302400	They're totally, they feel the same way about homosexuality.
5302400	5306160	Iran and Pakistan for a while, although not anymore,
5306160	5309360	were funding same-sex change operations
5309360	5311440	because they hang gay people from cranes.
5311440	5315360	That's why you get the death penalty for being gay.
5315360	5318240	So of course they want to heterosexualize and fix gay people.
5318240	5320160	But I would never have seen this coming.
5320160	5321120	None of us did.
5321120	5322720	I've spoken to all these gay activists
5322720	5324640	who've come out of retirement basically,
5324640	5326320	and they're like, we never saw it coming.
5328000	5330160	It's more dangerous now to be a gay kid
5330160	5331600	than it was when I was growing up.
5331600	5334160	Far more dangerous when I was growing up.
5334160	5335040	Oh, yes.
5335040	5335520	Yeah.
5335520	5337920	So you guys were actually doing pretty good under the,
5338560	5338960	what would you say?
5338960	5339840	We were doing all right.
5339840	5342480	The thumb of the Judeo-Christian fascists
5342480	5345920	instead of the tender mercies of the T-activist types.
5345920	5349200	You know, we had the government implementing a thing called Section 28
5349200	5353360	where they said that teachers couldn't mention homosexuality in schools
5353360	5355200	unless they linked it to AIDS.
5355200	5356080	That's not great.
5356080	5357600	That's a terrible situation to be in.
5358560	5359760	So there was that.
5359760	5362960	So we had anti-gay ideas from members of staff.
5362960	5363280	Fine.
5364240	5367680	If you were out as a gay kid, which no one was, by the way,
5367680	5368800	you would be beaten up.
5368800	5370320	You would be bullied.
5370320	5371680	You would be abused, right?
5371680	5374800	But what you wouldn't have is the figures in authority
5374800	5376320	wanting to chop your dick off.
5378080	5380400	And that's so it's much more dangerous now.
5380400	5384240	Like you wouldn't have politicians and the media
5384240	5387440	and the commentary and gay charity saying,
5387440	5389120	maybe we need to fix you.
5389120	5390240	Maybe we need to sterilize you.
5390240	5393200	So let me ask you a question about that.
5393200	5394400	And this is one that's really,
5395120	5396400	well, I don't know what to make of it.
5396800	5401200	I just like the stereotypical guy who says he's not bigoted.
5401200	5404000	I have a lot of gay friends, and they're people I really admire.
5404000	5407600	So Bjorn Lomburg, Douglas Murray, you, Andy Know.
5408240	5408880	That's four.
5408880	5411360	Those are pretty stellar examples, by the way.
5411360	5413440	I have a sneaking suspicion, by the way,
5413440	5417440	that the genetic configuration that leads to male homosexuality
5417440	5421040	is integrally tied up with creativity itself.
5421040	5423440	And that's why it sustains itself in the gene pool.
5424000	5425040	That is fascinating.
5425120	5427520	If true, put it aside, because I've always wondered
5427520	5429920	why you have this disproportionate correlation
5429920	5431760	of homosexuality and art.
5431760	5434800	Another possibility too, which is that if you happen to get
5434800	5438160	the balance between masculine and feminine qualities
5438160	5442400	exactly right as a man, you are hyper attractive to women.
5443440	5445360	So that's another possibility.
5445360	5450080	So you could think of homosexuality as an overshoot of that target.
5450080	5453360	Now, I'm speculating, although I think the creativity hypothesis
5453360	5454240	is a better one.
5454240	5456960	Imagine that homosexuality is polygenetic,
5456960	5460720	but it's associated with a much higher probability of creativity.
5461360	5463280	Well, then obviously it's going to be conserved,
5463280	5466720	even though it has lack of reproductive ability.
5467680	5470000	It has to be associated with something stellar,
5470000	5471680	because obviously it would just disappear.
5472480	5475520	So and gay men are radically overrepresented
5475520	5477600	in creative disciplines, like radically.
5477600	5479680	If you can get to the heart of why that is,
5479680	5480960	I'd be absolutely fascinated by that.
5481520	5482720	But that was a side point, wasn't it?
5482720	5484640	That was a side point from what you wanted to say about.
5484640	5487200	Yeah. Well, here is what I wanted to ask you about.
5487200	5488640	And I don't know what to do about this.
5488640	5490640	It's like, I think that part of the problem
5490640	5493440	that we're trying to figure out is back 20 years ago,
5493440	5498080	we did what we could to bring, especially male homosexuality,
5498080	5502480	into the center by legalizing gay marriage
5502480	5505600	and by attempting to normalize it in some ways.
5505600	5509680	Now, I think that left a lot of questions unanswered.
5509680	5510880	So here's one question.
5510960	5513840	It's like, well, okay, now if it's normalized all of a sudden,
5514560	5518640	same-sex relationships, same-sex sexual relationships,
5520240	5522720	where do you draw the line and what the hell do you teach children?
5523280	5526640	And one answer would be, you don't talk about sex at all.
5526640	5527840	And another answer would be, well,
5527840	5530320	you talk about gay sex 50% of the time.
5531360	5535200	I don't know what the answer is, but it really is a problem.
5535200	5538080	And I think we're dashing ourself to pieces
5538080	5539840	in some ways trying to solve that problem.
5540160	5543360	I don't know what the hell the solution in the US
5543360	5545760	is take your kids out of the school system.
5545760	5547600	That's what the solution seems to be.
5547600	5549920	So, but I don't know what you think about all that.
5549920	5551200	It's so difficult because I think
5551200	5553440	educationists at the moment are getting it very, very wrong
5553440	5555600	in terms of what they're teaching children about sex
5555600	5557840	and gender and sexuality and all the rest of it.
5557840	5559520	And I think gay people are bearing the brunt
5559520	5561440	of a lot of the blame here, you know?
5561440	5563680	So I think what's happening is, you know,
5563680	5566720	when you have drag queens twerking in front of children
5566720	5567760	or stripping in front of children or whatever.
5567760	5569120	Yeah, that doesn't seem good.
5569120	5570240	It doesn't look good.
5570240	5574000	And because they have bracketed us all as LGBTQIA+,
5574000	5577600	this is one big thing, then, you know,
5577600	5580800	and there's evidence, isn't there, that homophobia
5580800	5582160	or at least I don't really like the word,
5582160	5584640	but anti-gay sentiment is on the rise
5584640	5586080	because I think they think this is,
5586080	5588240	they think this is gay people doing all of this stuff.
5588240	5589840	It's not, it's gender ideologues.
5590400	5591920	It's gender ideologues who have taken over
5591920	5594000	the LGBT community, whatever that might be.
5595120	5597040	And as I've said, gender ideology
5597040	5598880	is actively hostile to homosexuality.
5599280	5605200	So gay people aren't the agents of these societal changes.
5605200	5606480	They're the victims of it,
5606480	5608160	because now I'm getting it from both sides.
5608160	5612400	So I published that article in the mail about the Pride flag,
5612400	5616080	and I was getting gender ideologues piling in on me,
5617040	5619600	calling me evil and telling me I should kill myself
5620160	5621200	and, you know, the lovely things
5621200	5622640	that the compassionate people often say.
5623280	5626000	And then I was also getting right-wing people,
5626000	5628240	mostly from America, calling me a sodomite
5628240	5629360	and saying that I was evil
5629360	5630960	and that I was going to burn in hell
5630960	5632000	for my sexual orientation.
5632000	5633280	So now we've got it from both sides.
5633280	5634000	So great.
5634000	5634720	Thanks for that.
5634720	5636720	I mean, that's what the woke have done.
5636720	5639280	They, you know, it's not, and that's why...
5639280	5640800	Yeah, and that isn't over yet.
5640800	5642000	You know, that isn't over yet.
5642000	5644400	That's going to get a lot worse before it gets better.
5644400	5646320	And God only knows how it's going to shake out.
5646320	5649280	I mean, this year's Pride celebration
5649280	5651360	was a whole new set of...
5651360	5653120	Well, people are getting sick of it.
5653120	5654240	Yes, yes, yes.
5654240	5655520	Well, no bloody wonder.
5655520	5656800	A month, really?
5656800	5657600	Yeah.
5657680	5659040	Good God, guys.
5659040	5660800	Partly because it's become so corporate.
5660800	5663520	You know, corporations put their flags up.
5663520	5664720	They don't put it up in the Middle East
5664720	5666960	or in Saudi Arabia or places like that,
5666960	5668960	where it might actually make a difference, by the way,
5668960	5671440	flying that flag, where gay people are killed for being gay.
5672320	5673040	No, they don't do that.
5673040	5674400	But they put it up here.
5674400	5678320	They never did this, by the way, before gay marriage,
5678320	5680400	before the age of consent was equalized.
5680400	5681200	They didn't do any of that.
5681200	5684640	They're doing it now because corporations
5684640	5686800	are so in lockstep with the woke ideology,
5686800	5688000	which is another reason, by the way,
5688000	5689920	if you want to go back to this left-right distinction,
5689920	5691600	why I think this is so unhelpful,
5691600	5692320	because it's a movement...
5692320	5693280	Right, right, I agree.
5693280	5693920	I agree.
5693920	5696000	Well, and I don't think there's any worse woke
5696000	5697600	than woke capitalism.
5697600	5697840	No, no.
5697840	5700640	That's the bastard child of greed and ideology, man.
5700640	5700880	I mean, that's...
5700880	5702080	It's some sort of monster.
5702080	5703680	Well, that is right-wing wokeness.
5703680	5706160	It can't be anything but because capitalism is a set...
5706160	5708640	You know, these are essentially money-making bodies.
5708640	5709440	These are not...
5709440	5712400	These are not socialist organizations.
5712400	5713360	It's...
5713360	5714720	So there is a confusion there.
5714720	5716000	And also, by the way,
5716480	5719840	the woke always side against the workers.
5719840	5720880	You know, whenever these...
5720880	5721440	I know.
5721440	5722080	That's so in...
5722080	5722720	And the poor.
5722720	5723280	And the poor.
5723280	5724320	And the poor, so...
5724320	5724880	I know.
5724880	5726320	That's so interesting, too,
5726320	5728400	because I've watched the radicals,
5728400	5730800	especially in Europe over the last five years,
5730800	5731680	because I was curious.
5731680	5734000	It's like, well, when push comes to shove,
5734000	5735840	let's say, on the climate front,
5735840	5738960	are they going to sacrifice the poor on the altar of woke?
5738960	5741280	And the answer is, in a bloody heartbeat,
5741280	5742320	in a second, no holds forward.
5742320	5744000	That's what net zero does.
5744000	5745520	Net zero is precisely that.
5745600	5746960	It's the poor, the better-brun.
5746960	5747760	But that's why I don't think...
5747760	5748960	Absolutely.
5748960	5750800	And whereas I'm probably wrong to say
5751520	5754080	the wokeness is closer to the right or whatever that is,
5754080	5755680	it's definitely not a left-wing movement
5755680	5756800	in any traditional understanding
5756800	5757760	of what left-wing means.
5757760	5758640	It can't be.
5758640	5760240	No, I think we have to stop thinking
5760240	5761440	about it politically altogether.
5761440	5761600	Exactly, exactly.
5761600	5762720	I think, fundamentally,
5762720	5764720	the religious analysis is the right one.
5764720	5766480	But that's a weird one, Andrew.
5766480	5768400	That's going to take us some strange places,
5768400	5770160	because if this is actually...
5770160	5772000	First of all, we're actually making the claim
5772000	5774240	that this is a spiritual battle, right?
5774240	5775520	A religious battle.
5775520	5778400	And that's a hell of a claim to make, you know?
5778400	5780320	Especially for somebody who's more tilted
5780320	5781440	towards atheism.
5781440	5783040	And I don't even know what the hell it means
5783040	5784160	to make that claim.
5784160	5787040	But I don't think it is a political struggle, fundamentally.
5787040	5787680	That's right.
5787680	5790960	And to bring that into the LGBTQ stuff,
5791520	5793200	the way that sex education appears
5793200	5794560	to be run at the moment,
5794560	5796160	I don't know how it is necessarily where you are,
5796160	5799280	but in Wales, definitely, in Scotland, definitely,
5799280	5800880	and in England, we are having similar problems,
5801760	5804640	you have gender ideologues writing the curriculum,
5804640	5805200	effectively.
5805200	5805600	Yeah, yeah.
5805600	5806960	So children are being told.
5806960	5809040	Even worse, Canada, after all.
5809040	5810320	Oh, yeah, of course, of course.
5810320	5811760	Think of this country.
5811760	5813760	I mean, we've got narcissistic...
5813760	5815680	We've got, what would we say?
5815680	5819280	We've got the cardinal narcissist running our country.
5819280	5821920	He's everything woke you could possibly imagine.
5821920	5824000	And he's got that psychopathic charm
5824000	5827280	that lends itself to fooling gullible women.
5827280	5829040	It's a perfect bloody storm.
5829040	5833040	I don't see any difference between effectively encouraging teachers
5833680	5838080	to promote gender identity ideology to young children
5838080	5842560	as having some kind of hook-handed Islamic cleric come in
5842560	5844720	and say gay people should be burned to death.
5844720	5846160	I don't really see the difference there.
5846160	5852560	And so far as you're promoting a really reactionary belief system
5852560	5855280	on to children when it comes to the realm of sex and sexuality.
5855280	5857360	And I think that's really, really dangerous.
5857360	5859440	So unless we grapple with this point,
5859440	5862400	or unless we as a general population grapple with the fact
5862400	5866000	that sex education now is really a religious preaching,
5866000	5866720	that's all it is.
5868320	5870320	You were talking about where do you stop?
5870320	5872320	How much do you teach them about what?
5872320	5873760	Actually, kids generally learn
5873760	5875440	and figure things out for themselves, don't they?
5875440	5877920	So I've always been of the view that sex education
5877920	5879120	doesn't need to be as...
5879120	5881280	I think people need to know the basics.
5881280	5884400	But I think there's far too much of it going on.
5884400	5885840	But we've reached the point where,
5885840	5888160	I mean, you must have heard this audio recording
5888160	5890960	that was leaked this week from a school in England,
5890960	5892640	a place called Rye College.
5892640	5897200	The teacher was recorded berating two 13-year-old girls
5897200	5898560	because they would not accept
5898560	5900960	that one of their peers identified as a cat.
5900960	5901760	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5901760	5903440	And look, it looks silly.
5903440	5904720	Well, it's pretty rude, you know.
5905440	5906000	It is.
5906000	5908560	To not let the poor girl wear a tail and all that.
5909440	5911280	Well, you know, this is the thing.
5912000	5914480	There was a report in the Telegraph this week as well
5914480	5917680	saying that there's a school where one child identifies
5917680	5918800	as a horse.
5918800	5920560	There's one who identifies as a dinosaur.
5920560	5922080	There's one who, quite creatively,
5922080	5925040	identifies as a moon and wears a cape.
5925040	5926480	Now, I think what's happening there
5926480	5928560	is those kids are being satirical.
5928560	5930080	They're... What they're seeing is...
5930080	5931120	God, I hope so.
5931120	5931600	No, I think they are.
5931600	5932240	Go, kids, go.
5932720	5934240	You know, the kids that are saying,
5934240	5936400	I'm a cat and I need to lie down
5936400	5938480	and I need to be stroked and I need to meow.
5939040	5941280	Look, they have seen that the figures of authority,
5941280	5944240	the teachers, are totally capitulating
5944240	5946240	to this bizarre belief system,
5946240	5949440	this esoteric cult, and unless...
5949440	5950800	I would have done that in a heartbeat
5950800	5951440	when I was 30.
5951440	5952080	I would have.
5952080	5954480	As a kid, I would have said,
5954480	5956400	I'm a velociraptor and you know,
5956400	5957760	you have to, you know, and you do what I say
5957760	5958880	or I'll eat you or whatever.
5958880	5961200	I don't care what it is, but they...
5961200	5962160	These kids are pushy.
5962160	5963520	They always test the limits anyway.
5964080	5965520	But what's brilliant about this is
5966160	5968720	the teachers can't do anything about it.
5969440	5972320	If a young child decides he's a moon
5972320	5973600	and wears a cape and a teacher says,
5973600	5974400	no, you're not,
5974400	5975840	she's denying the sacred creed
5975840	5977360	of gender identity ideology,
5977360	5978960	which is in the national curriculum now.
5979760	5981440	So she'll get fired.
5981440	5984560	So this puts the kids in an incredible position of power.
5984560	5985840	They're having fun with it.
5985840	5990160	And this is also why I'm slightly heartened by this,
5990160	5991440	because I kind of think the kids
5991440	5993280	are going to be our way out of this.
5993280	5996560	I think I hope that this mad religious fervor
5996560	5998160	will burn out because the kids see it
5998160	5999280	for what it is.
5999280	6000400	You know, the fact that that woman
6000400	6001760	in that recording was saying that these girls,
6001760	6003520	well, I think she said they were despicable.
6003520	6004640	I think that was the word she used,
6004640	6007920	despicable for not validating
6007920	6010800	or accepting their friend's identity as a cat.
6012160	6014240	I mean, that's such an extreme position
6014240	6015520	for a teacher to take.
6015520	6016320	I also don't, by the way,
6016320	6019520	I don't think it's fair to dog pile her and bombard.
6019520	6022960	And I saw someone doxing her, putting her face.
6022960	6024320	And look, she's just following,
6024880	6026640	she's probably not a very intelligent person.
6026640	6027920	She's probably not a very thinking person.
6027920	6029920	But she's just following what she's told to say.
6029920	6032640	She's been told by all of the teacher training colleges,
6032640	6034080	all of the academics in education
6034080	6035600	that this is the case and you've got to go with it.
6035600	6037200	And she's just doing her job.
6037200	6038720	So I think that's unfair as well.
6039280	6040960	I would like teachers to be more intelligent
6040960	6042960	and creative and to challenge this stuff.
6043680	6045120	But, you know, that's not happening.
6046000	6046960	So yeah, maybe it may be...
6046960	6049840	I guess we're learning why the eternal serpent
6049840	6051680	always devours its own tail, right?
6051680	6052160	Right.
6052160	6054240	It's so interesting to see these things
6054240	6057200	push too far, start to eat themselves.
6057200	6058480	You know, it's...
6058480	6060560	We're living in the strangest times, man.
6060560	6061360	That might be it.
6061360	6062560	That might be the hope, though, right?
6062560	6065360	So it's an optimistic point to make.
6066000	6069680	But ultimately, because I think this ideology
6069680	6072480	is not sustainable, because it is too full of...
6072480	6075520	We did walk ourselves back from the brink of tyranny
6075520	6077280	on the COVID lockdown front, right?
6077280	6078240	I mean, we were...
6078240	6080480	We went full totalitarian for two years,
6080480	6082080	but then everybody seemed to decide
6082080	6084080	maybe that wasn't such a good idea.
6084080	6085520	But that's quite instructive, isn't it?
6085520	6087200	The way that we now talk about it.
6087920	6088720	Everyone sort of...
6088720	6090000	No one mentions it now, do they?
6091920	6094560	You walk around, very few people wearing masks.
6095680	6096800	People have just sort of...
6096800	6098080	There came a weird turning point
6098080	6099520	where everyone just decided,
6099520	6102400	actually, it's a virus with a very low mortality rate.
6102400	6103600	Let's just not worry about it.
6103600	6104800	And that just sort of happened.
6105360	6108880	People have forgotten the mania, the extreme mania.
6108880	6110560	People screaming at each other on the streets
6110560	6113760	if they weren't wearing masks and the extreme policies.
6114720	6116560	The Canadian government's reaction
6116560	6118560	to the truckers who were worried
6118560	6120160	about their livelihood due to lockdown.
6120160	6122160	You mean stealing their bank accounts?
6122160	6123760	Stealing their bank accounts
6123760	6125520	and threatening to give them money
6125520	6127440	to other charities or something?
6127440	6128640	Didn't they even...
6128640	6129360	I mean, you'll know.
6129360	6130080	Yeah, yeah, Go said...
6130080	6134160	So $10 million was raised on GoFundMe.
6134160	6134960	That's it, yeah.
6134960	6137920	And then GoFundMe decided
6137920	6140080	they weren't going to distribute it to the truckers.
6140080	6142880	Then they decided, instead of refunding it,
6142880	6144480	they were going to distribute it
6144480	6146480	to a charity of their choice.
6147280	6148960	Then Ron DeSantis said,
6148960	6151840	I think you better not do that or else.
6151840	6153840	And then they decided they would refund it.
6153840	6156160	And now the money that hasn't been refunded
6156160	6158640	is in escrow and there's a huge fight in Canada
6158640	6159760	about who owns it.
6159760	6161840	We haven't settled the trucker mess here at all.
6162720	6163840	But the trucker convoy,
6163840	6165360	it had something to do with everybody
6165360	6166960	taking those goddamn masks off.
6166960	6167600	I'm sure.
6167600	6170480	I wonder how those politicians
6170480	6172000	who were involved in this will feel about this
6172000	6173200	in 20 years' time.
6173200	6176320	I know one of your politicians claimed
6176320	6178800	that the truckers were beeping their horns
6178800	6181120	because they were dog whistling to fascists
6181120	6183920	because the honk honk is HH
6183920	6185360	and that means Heil Hitler.
6185360	6186960	I mean, that was something that was seriously said by...
6186960	6188560	Well, that's common knowledge here in Andrew.
6188560	6189680	Everybody who honks their horn
6189680	6191520	is actually secretly admiring Hitler,
6191520	6192800	especially if they do it twice.
6193440	6194800	That is so insane.
6195840	6197440	So I wonder whether...
6197440	6199840	That's Salem which trial level is insane.
6199840	6200320	Exactly.
6200400	6202400	And Salem is a good example, right?
6202400	6203520	Because, you know,
6203520	6205040	there's a reason I've used it in the book
6205040	6208240	is that I think it gives us our clues to our way out.
6208800	6210640	Because Salem happened so quickly,
6210640	6212880	it happened within just over a year, right?
6212880	6213840	Late 17th century,
6214400	6217200	this hysteria emerged from nowhere
6217200	6219440	and fizzled out immediately
6219440	6221520	and everyone afterwards repented.
6222480	6224480	All of the people who were most involved in it said,
6224480	6225360	we got that wrong.
6226080	6226800	What happened there?
6226800	6228240	We went mad for a while there
6228240	6229520	because they weren't...
6229520	6235600	Well, this is maybe the first widespread mental illness
6235600	6238400	afflicting our new electronic nervous system.
6238400	6238960	That's it.
6238960	6241920	I think this is a hysteria on a global scale,
6243280	6245760	akin to what happened in Salem.
6245760	6252000	I think it's perpetuated itself by a similar means,
6252000	6255440	which is firstly just the mechanism of hysteria,
6255440	6256720	which I'm not qualified to talk about,
6257200	6260400	but also the fact that people in authority
6260400	6262880	go along with it because they're terrified not to.
6262880	6264400	You know, because in Salem,
6264400	6266320	anyone said, hang on, I don't think this is right,
6266320	6268160	they were the next to be executed.
6268160	6269600	So you don't have politicians saying,
6269600	6273440	hang on a minute, is it possible for human beings to change sex?
6273440	6274880	Do I know what a woman is?
6274880	6276080	They all know the answer,
6276080	6277920	just as the magistrates in Salem
6277920	6279600	knew that the girls weren't seeing the devil.
6280560	6282720	But it all fizzled out very, very quickly.
6283440	6284720	One of the points I make in the book
6284720	6288160	is about that all of the prosecutions were secured
6288160	6290400	on this thing called spectral evidence.
6290400	6292480	In other words, the girls' experience,
6292480	6293840	what we call lived experience.
6293840	6296320	The girls believed that they were seeing devils,
6296320	6298800	and therefore that was taken as evidence.
6298800	6300960	And that's why the cases collapsed,
6300960	6304160	because at the end, the deputy governor of Massachusetts
6304160	6306480	wrote to the leading clergyman in the country and said,
6306480	6310000	can spectral evidence be admissible in court?
6310000	6312320	And they all said, no, of course not.
6312320	6313760	The whole thing disappeared overnight.
6313760	6315200	Everyone denied they had any part in it.
6315920	6316880	These weren't witch hunters.
6316880	6318400	They didn't go around hunting witches.
6318400	6319440	That happened a lot in Europe.
6319440	6320880	It didn't happen in New England.
6320880	6321280	And so they were good people.
6321280	6324880	Maybe that's the least stupid pathway forward for us now.
6324880	6327440	And maybe, God willing, that's the one we'll take.
6327440	6329440	We should stop, I guess, I don't want to,
6329440	6331120	because you're very entertaining to talk to.
6331840	6333440	For everybody watching and listening,
6333440	6335680	I'm going to talk to Andrew for another half an hour.
6336560	6338480	On the Daily Wire Plus platform side,
6338480	6340080	a little bit more personally,
6340080	6342160	I want to see a bit more about what makes them tick.
6342160	6343440	And so if you're interested in that,
6343440	6345360	head over to the Daily Wire Plus platform.
6345360	6347440	You could throw those characters,
6347440	6350640	those reprehensible right-wing bastards a penny or two,
6350640	6355200	if you're inclined to, because they are heading the fight
6355200	6356480	to support free speech.
6356480	6358880	In the US, the YouTube has been after us,
6358880	6361040	because I'm allied with the Daily Wire types,
6361040	6363760	been after us pretty badly in the last month.
6363760	6366160	They took down three of my talks,
6366160	6367520	including one with Helen Joyce,
6367520	6370240	because you know how reprehensible good old Helen,
6370240	6372080	the Economist journalist is.
6372080	6375120	And they also took down a talk I had with Robert F. Kennedy,
6375120	6378480	despite the fact that he's running for president.
6378480	6380000	And so that's YouTube,
6380000	6382320	and they're definitely going after all the Daily Wire folks.
6382320	6384720	So thank you all for your time and attention,
6384720	6386160	and to Andrew for talking to me
6386160	6388000	and helping me delve into these things,
6388000	6390480	get a little bit more clarity along with everyone else.
6390480	6392960	And for everyone watching and listening,
6392960	6393760	we'll see you soon.
6393760	6396640	And to the Daily Wire folks, thanks for your support.
6397440	6399200	Andrew, off to the Daily Wire.
6399200	6400800	Thank you very much.
