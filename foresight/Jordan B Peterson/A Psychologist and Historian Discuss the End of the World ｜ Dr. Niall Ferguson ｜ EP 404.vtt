00:00.000 --> 00:04.160
The more people refer to the science,

00:04.240 --> 00:07.120
the more you should suspect that they are engaged

00:07.200 --> 00:10.280
in some quasi-religious activity.

00:10.360 --> 00:14.920
This kind of wrong-headedness leads to all kinds of policy errors

00:15.000 --> 00:19.200
because people have focused on the satisfaction of asceticism.

00:19.280 --> 00:22.240
It's very significant that in our lifetimes,

00:22.320 --> 00:26.120
governments have got worse at dealing with disasters, not better.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.520
Despite the accumulation of scientific knowledge,

00:28.640 --> 00:32.960
we seem somehow, collectively, to be worse at scientific thinking.

00:47.560 --> 00:50.080
Hello, everyone, watching and listening.

00:50.160 --> 00:53.280
Today, I'm speaking with historian and author Neil Ferguson.

00:53.360 --> 00:56.760
We haven't spoken before, although I've wanted to for a long time.

00:56.920 --> 01:01.120
We discuss the historical and deeply mythological precedent

01:01.200 --> 01:03.640
of world-ending narratives,

01:03.720 --> 01:06.520
how the Global Doomsday Ethos

01:06.600 --> 01:11.400
abdicates local responsibility while empowering the elite class,

01:11.480 --> 01:16.600
the out-of-control gigantism plaguing our administrative states today,

01:16.680 --> 01:19.240
and how we might strive as individuals

01:19.320 --> 01:22.320
to deal with the genuine tragedy of life,

01:22.400 --> 01:26.040
morally, humbly, and religiously.

01:26.160 --> 01:30.520
So, I was reviewing your book, Doom, this morning,

01:30.600 --> 01:33.440
and I've been wanting to talk to you about it for a long time.

01:33.520 --> 01:38.640
I'm very interested in the apocalyptic vision

01:38.720 --> 01:46.760
and its implications for political organization

01:46.840 --> 01:49.840
and psychological organization as well.

01:49.920 --> 01:53.840
And I thought I'd just start with a couple of comments to get us going.

01:54.840 --> 01:57.720
The apocalypse, in some ways, is always upon us,

01:57.800 --> 02:00.400
and you write about that in your book.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.520
I mean, because people might ask,

02:02.600 --> 02:09.880
well, why has mankind always been consumed at the narrative level

02:09.960 --> 02:11.720
with notions of the end of the world?

02:11.800 --> 02:14.520
And the answer to that is at least in part

02:14.600 --> 02:20.840
because we always inhabit demarcated conceptual worlds

02:20.920 --> 02:22.120
and even embodied worlds,

02:22.120 --> 02:25.000
and all of those worlds do come to an end.

02:25.080 --> 02:28.080
And so, the idea that there's a universal end

02:28.160 --> 02:30.480
is built into the fabric of reality,

02:30.560 --> 02:33.880
and it's something that we have to permanently contend with.

02:33.960 --> 02:38.360
And so, it's there as a lurking existential abyss,

02:38.440 --> 02:41.600
but it's also there as a practical problem that we have to contend with.

02:41.680 --> 02:46.920
And the grand apocalyptic visions, the book of Revelation, for example,

02:47.000 --> 02:50.360
are in part attempts to structure our apprehension

02:50.600 --> 02:55.320
of the, what would you say, the eternal apocalypse

02:55.400 --> 02:59.280
and to also help us determine, practically and politically,

02:59.360 --> 03:03.200
how that might be at least staved off,

03:03.280 --> 03:07.560
although perhaps even managed more comprehensively.

03:07.640 --> 03:10.840
And so, I guess I'm curious,

03:10.920 --> 03:13.280
why did your interest, do you think,

03:13.360 --> 03:15.480
coalesce around the conception of doom?

03:15.560 --> 03:20.320
And it's been a couple of years now since this book was published,

03:20.400 --> 03:23.080
how have your conceptions changed?

03:23.160 --> 03:30.080
And what did you learn as a consequence of investigating this narrative trope so deeply?

03:30.160 --> 03:35.520
There's a great sketch in the Beyond the Fringe album,

03:35.600 --> 03:40.600
which goes right back to Peter Cook and Dudley Moore,

03:40.680 --> 03:44.840
Jonathan Miller and Alan Bennett in the 1960s.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.920
And the sketch is the end of the world,

03:47.160 --> 03:51.800
and it's essentially a sect of millenarians who gather on a hill

03:51.880 --> 03:55.120
to anticipate the end of the world.

03:55.200 --> 03:59.720
They have a long and quite amusing discussion about what it's likely to involve.

03:59.800 --> 04:03.280
Will the veil of the temple be rent asunder?

04:03.360 --> 04:07.960
And the time comes, they count down to the end of the world,

04:08.040 --> 04:09.440
and nothing happens.

04:09.520 --> 04:11.840
And Peter Cook, who's the leader of the sect,

04:11.920 --> 04:16.760
ends the sketch by, well, never mind, lads, same time next week.

04:16.760 --> 04:19.720
And I always thought that was very funny,

04:19.800 --> 04:24.120
because the end of the world has been consistently overpredicted

04:24.200 --> 04:27.880
by human beings for millennia.

04:27.960 --> 04:30.360
We're fascinated by the idea of the end of the world,

04:30.440 --> 04:32.760
and I think it's for a slightly different reason

04:32.840 --> 04:35.680
from the one that you hypothesized.

04:35.760 --> 04:42.480
We have the reality that we as individuals end to contend with.

04:42.600 --> 04:48.720
That's just one of the givens of human life.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.760
Even for billionaires in Silicon Valley,

04:51.840 --> 04:57.880
right now, the end of their individual lives is inevitable.

04:57.960 --> 05:03.400
And that's really the hardest thing to deal with about life, that it ends.

05:03.480 --> 05:06.760
And we also know how it ends, we know what that's like,

05:06.840 --> 05:11.000
because at some time or another in our lives, we encounter death.

05:11.080 --> 05:14.480
The death of a grandparent, a parent, of a friend.

05:14.560 --> 05:17.560
We also see things being destroyed.

05:17.640 --> 05:21.600
We see buildings collapse or bridges.

05:21.680 --> 05:24.920
We see fires consume areas of woodland.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.040
So we know what dissolution looks like,

05:27.120 --> 05:28.640
not just for us as individuals,

05:28.720 --> 05:34.120
but we know what it looks like for expanses of land or edifices.

05:34.200 --> 05:38.360
And I think we therefore infer the consoling thought

05:38.480 --> 05:44.320
that it's all going to go down in flames at some future date.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.520
And the great monotheistic religions

05:46.600 --> 05:49.800
have as one of their centerpieces the end of the world.

05:49.880 --> 05:53.520
It's there in Islam as well as in Christianity.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.000
And I think it's also exciting.

05:56.080 --> 06:01.440
I think we find the end of the world kind of a cinematic prospect,

06:01.520 --> 06:04.000
which is why there are so many movies about it,

06:04.080 --> 06:06.320
as well as works of science fiction.

06:06.360 --> 06:08.440
So we're fascinated by the end of the world

06:08.520 --> 06:11.040
because it's clearly a spectacular prospect,

06:11.120 --> 06:14.160
but it's also consoling to us, we may die as individuals,

06:14.240 --> 06:16.640
but everything's going down at some point.

06:16.720 --> 06:18.400
And the issue is when?

06:18.480 --> 06:25.320
So many Christians at successive periods in the history of Christianity

06:25.400 --> 06:28.960
have anticipated quite an imminent end of the world.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.120
And of course, they're always disappointed,

06:31.200 --> 06:33.240
like Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.760
So the consoling issue,

06:35.800 --> 06:37.800
I mean, the easy read on that, I suppose,

06:37.880 --> 06:41.320
is that the end of the world is the precondition

06:41.400 --> 06:44.760
for the establishment of an ever more glorious paradise.

06:44.840 --> 06:47.760
And you can understand a consolation in that.

06:47.840 --> 06:51.320
But you're pointing to a different kind of consolation, I suppose,

06:51.400 --> 06:54.120
which is, it seems to me, correct me if I'm wrong,

06:54.200 --> 06:58.160
that something like Schadenfreude is that the fact that we end

06:58.240 --> 07:01.320
is easier to swallow if we understand it

07:01.400 --> 07:04.360
in relationship to the potential end of everything.

07:04.400 --> 07:08.520
So I don't exactly understand why you highlighted consolation.

07:08.600 --> 07:12.360
I can see it in the heavenly vision, let's say, post-apocalypse,

07:12.440 --> 07:15.360
but yours, you seem to be pointing to something else.

07:15.440 --> 07:20.600
Well, of course, religion offers an afterlife

07:20.680 --> 07:25.960
that will be better and resurrection in the case of

07:26.040 --> 07:29.040
the great monotheistic religions.

07:29.120 --> 07:33.160
But I don't think that's always what's in people's minds

07:33.240 --> 07:35.760
when they contemplate the end of the world.

07:35.840 --> 07:37.720
I was very struck as I was researching the book,

07:37.800 --> 07:41.960
how many times in the midst of a localized disaster,

07:42.040 --> 07:46.000
individuals said it felt like the end of the world.

07:46.080 --> 07:51.680
So when you're in the midst of a massive conflagration,

07:51.760 --> 07:54.760
the biggest wildfire in US history,

07:54.840 --> 07:59.040
or when you're in London during the Blitz,

07:59.120 --> 08:03.040
when you're in the midst of some localized disaster,

08:03.320 --> 08:05.240
it seems somehow consoling to say,

08:05.320 --> 08:07.960
oh, it's clearly the end of the world.

08:08.040 --> 08:10.080
So I don't think it's just that people say,

08:10.160 --> 08:14.360
and therefore I can look forward to being reunited with my ancestors

08:14.440 --> 08:16.200
in some happy afterlife.

08:16.280 --> 08:18.920
I think there's just a sense that if everybody's going down,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.800
that doesn't make it quite so bad as if it's just me.

08:22.680 --> 08:25.720
Well, you know, there might be another element to it as well.

08:25.800 --> 08:29.920
I mean, the Terminator movie series came to mind

08:29.920 --> 08:33.760
when you were walking through your discussion,

08:33.840 --> 08:36.040
I suppose, in reference to the science fiction

08:36.120 --> 08:37.680
representations of the end of the world.

08:37.760 --> 08:42.560
And all of our conceptual schemes,

08:42.640 --> 08:44.760
when they encounter an obstacle,

08:44.840 --> 08:47.160
undergo a collapse into a kind of chaos

08:47.240 --> 08:48.840
and then a potential regeneration.

08:48.920 --> 08:51.600
And that's the same as a stage transition

08:51.680 --> 08:54.080
in Piagetian child development.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.280
And it's the same as the scientific revolution.

08:56.320 --> 09:00.320
And every act of learning is simultaneously

09:00.400 --> 09:03.040
the death of some set of preconceptions.

09:03.120 --> 09:04.960
And there's pain in that,

09:05.040 --> 09:07.680
which is partly why we don't like to have our ideas challenged.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.520
But you know, there's also adventure in it.

09:09.600 --> 09:13.520
And part of the reason that people do go to watch movies

09:13.600 --> 09:18.320
like The Terminator and the plethora of the end of the world

09:18.400 --> 09:20.680
movies that do make themselves manifest

09:20.760 --> 09:24.920
is because I think we can see in the confrontation

09:24.960 --> 09:28.240
with cataclysm an adventure.

09:28.320 --> 09:29.920
I mean, that's what people are doing in a theater

09:30.000 --> 09:31.680
when they're watching the Terminator series.

09:31.760 --> 09:33.440
I mean, it's a dreadful adventure,

09:33.520 --> 09:34.840
but it's a total adventure.

09:34.920 --> 09:36.240
It's completely engrossing.

09:36.320 --> 09:39.560
And it might be that you could imagine,

09:39.640 --> 09:42.280
and I think that this is part of the emphasis

09:42.360 --> 09:45.640
of the Judeo-Christian notion of ultimate sacrifice.

09:45.720 --> 09:50.440
You could imagine welcoming the apocalyptic reality

09:50.520 --> 09:52.920
of the world with open arms,

09:53.040 --> 09:55.160
being willing to undergo that adventure

09:55.240 --> 09:57.280
of continual death and transformation,

09:57.360 --> 09:59.360
and transforming it,

09:59.440 --> 10:02.760
that entire death and rebirth process

10:02.840 --> 10:07.560
into something like the most exciting possible adventure.

10:07.640 --> 10:10.720
I mean, you know, what you do see in the biblical corpus,

10:10.800 --> 10:13.440
there's always a wrestling with the apocalyptic reality

10:13.520 --> 10:16.520
of existence, socially and individually.

10:16.600 --> 10:21.320
And there is the insistence throughout the text

10:21.320 --> 10:23.720
that the appropriate way to deal with that

10:23.800 --> 10:25.720
is not to run from it or deny it,

10:25.800 --> 10:28.360
but to really, to the degree that it's possible,

10:28.440 --> 10:30.080
to welcome it with open arms.

10:30.160 --> 10:32.560
Now, that's a very tricky thing to manage, obviously.

10:32.640 --> 10:36.000
How do you welcome the death of everything with open arms?

10:36.080 --> 10:37.840
But in some ways, it doesn't matter

10:37.920 --> 10:41.000
because it's a reality that people have to face.

10:41.080 --> 10:43.320
I think what's fascinating about the book of Revelation

10:43.400 --> 10:46.760
is that it's so spectacular.

10:46.840 --> 10:53.640
It's an extraordinary visualisation of a cataclysm.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.280
And it's really very elaborate.

10:55.360 --> 10:58.120
It's worth reading and trying to picture it in your mind,

10:58.200 --> 11:02.640
and you realise that you would need the most advanced computer graphics

11:02.720 --> 11:06.080
to realise it on a screen.

11:06.160 --> 11:10.600
I think it's partly that you need a spectacular prelude

11:10.680 --> 11:13.560
for the Kingdom of God to be plausible,

11:13.640 --> 11:15.400
because the terrible truth about the Kingdom of God

11:15.440 --> 11:17.400
is that it does sound quite dull.

11:18.480 --> 11:24.760
I mean, the reality about the saints and angels

11:24.840 --> 11:29.320
and God himself is that they don't really know how to throw a party,

11:29.400 --> 11:34.880
and we need more than that to excite us.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.480
So I think that the apocalypse is attractive

11:37.560 --> 11:42.640
because it's so much more exciting than the ultimate outcome,

11:42.720 --> 11:44.960
the utopian outcome of heaven.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.800
Now, what's interesting about science fiction

11:46.880 --> 11:49.200
is that it really discards utopia.

11:49.280 --> 11:53.120
There's some utopian science fiction about most of its dystopian,

11:53.200 --> 11:56.280
and you gave the example of the Terminator movie series.

11:56.360 --> 12:00.240
That's part of a long tradition of visualising an end of the world

12:00.320 --> 12:05.080
which is dystopian, where an apocalyptic event occurs

12:05.160 --> 12:09.280
and all you're really left with in the case of the Terminator movies

12:09.360 --> 12:13.320
is a pile of rubble in which a few surviving humans

12:13.360 --> 12:16.720
are picked off by killer robots.

12:17.480 --> 12:19.240
The interesting thing to me about science fiction

12:19.320 --> 12:23.160
is that from its birth in the early 19th century as a genre,

12:23.240 --> 12:26.760
it provides the apocalypse without the prospect

12:26.840 --> 12:30.760
of some ultimate reign of God and the saints,

12:30.840 --> 12:32.440
and we find that hugely exciting.

12:32.520 --> 12:34.880
So the paradox at the heart of the book is

12:34.960 --> 12:37.920
that we spend a lot of time thinking about the end of the world.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.080
Of course, environmentalists are the latest heirs

12:41.200 --> 12:42.600
to the millenarian tradition.

12:42.680 --> 12:44.800
They love to say that the world is about to end.

12:44.880 --> 12:48.240
It's in 12 years, it must be now eight years and counting.

12:48.320 --> 12:52.080
That's part of a long tradition where secular movements

12:52.160 --> 12:55.880
embrace often unwittingly religious ideas

12:55.960 --> 12:59.520
about the impending apocalypse.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.640
And that's exciting to people, so they're drawn to it.

13:02.720 --> 13:07.640
Greta Thunberg is just the latest prophet of the millennium.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.600
And I think that's a very important reason

13:10.680 --> 13:13.960
to be sceptical about stories about the end of the world,

13:14.040 --> 13:16.960
because while we spend a lot of time discussing the end of the world

13:17.040 --> 13:21.880
in its latest incarnation, the catastrophic climate scenario,

13:21.960 --> 13:26.400
we kind of miss the much more likely, smaller scale,

13:26.480 --> 13:30.000
medium-sized disasters, and the key point the book makes

13:30.080 --> 13:32.120
is we're getting worse at handling those.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.320
So we spend ages talking about the end of the world,

13:34.400 --> 13:37.400
endless conferences on climate change and the apocalypse,

13:37.480 --> 13:39.600
and we utterly bungle.

13:39.680 --> 13:43.880
Or what was, in fact, not a particularly disastrous pandemic.

13:43.960 --> 13:48.000
And we're going to bungle our way through some geopolitical disasters.

13:48.080 --> 13:50.200
We're doing that right now.

13:50.280 --> 13:52.360
I think that's the critical argument of the book,

13:52.440 --> 13:54.520
and that's why the subtitle of the book is so important,

13:54.600 --> 13:56.760
The Politics of Catastrophe.

13:56.840 --> 14:00.560
The key argument the book makes is that most disasters

14:00.640 --> 14:04.920
shouldn't be thought of as either natural or man-made.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.160
Disasters happen,

14:06.200 --> 14:10.400
and then we, as a species, collectively bungle them or not.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.480
And that's the critical point.

14:12.560 --> 14:16.800
Disasters are, in many ways, politically determined,

14:16.880 --> 14:18.960
even if their origins are natural.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.880
So that's the argument of the book.

14:22.160 --> 14:25.200
As the holiday season unfolds, it's a time of joy,

14:25.280 --> 14:27.040
gratitude, and reflection.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.960
In the midst of all these festivities,

14:29.040 --> 14:31.760
consider taking a moment to reflect on the digital footprint

14:31.840 --> 14:33.720
that accompanies you through the season.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.520
Think about all the information on your phone.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.440
From anything you search, your location,

14:37.520 --> 14:39.520
to the websites you shop at and more,

14:39.600 --> 14:41.840
companies can legally gather this information

14:41.920 --> 14:44.240
and sell your data for profit.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.240
That's why you need to do what I do

14:46.320 --> 14:49.040
and keep your data private with ExpressVPN.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.840
ExpressVPN is an app on your phone and computer

14:51.920 --> 14:53.600
that encrypts all of your online traffic

14:53.680 --> 14:55.840
so whatever you do stays private.

14:55.920 --> 14:58.320
If you think incognito mode will stop people

14:58.400 --> 15:00.000
from tracking your online activity,

15:00.080 --> 15:02.080
think again when you read the fine print

15:02.160 --> 15:04.720
that appears when you start browsing in incognito mode.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.960
It says that your activity might still be visible

15:07.040 --> 15:08.480
to your employer, your school,

15:08.560 --> 15:10.240
or your internet service provider.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.480
Without ExpressVPN, every site you visit

15:12.560 --> 15:14.880
could be logged by the admin of that network.

15:14.960 --> 15:18.240
We love using ExpressVPN because of how easy it is to use.

15:18.320 --> 15:19.680
The app has one button.

15:19.760 --> 15:22.640
Once you turn it on, you're protected from prying eyes.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.880
The Daily Wire has partnered with ExpressVPN

15:24.960 --> 15:27.040
to get you a special holiday offer.

15:27.120 --> 15:30.000

15:30.080 --> 15:32.080

15:38.480 --> 15:40.480
Okay, so there's three themes there

15:40.560 --> 15:44.560
that I'd like to expound upon.

15:44.640 --> 15:48.640
So the first is, you interestingly pointed out

15:48.720 --> 15:52.000
that the dystopia and the apocalypse

15:52.080 --> 15:55.440
is more interesting than the app.

15:55.520 --> 15:57.600
The first one is, you know,

15:57.600 --> 16:01.120
the dystopia and the apocalypse is more interesting

16:01.200 --> 16:05.120
than the subsequent heaven.

16:05.200 --> 16:10.160
And that's the problem with socialist visions of utopia

16:10.240 --> 16:15.120
that people like Dostoevsky laid out in the late 1800s.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.720
In notes from underground,

16:16.800 --> 16:18.800
Dostoevsky famously pointed out

16:18.880 --> 16:22.320
that if we did bring about the socialist utopia,

16:22.400 --> 16:26.000
and he described that as the endless opportunity

16:26.000 --> 16:28.560
of pools of bubbling water,

16:28.640 --> 16:31.200
busy ourselves with the continuation of the species

16:31.280 --> 16:33.200
and eat nothing but cake,

16:33.280 --> 16:35.840
that human beings would break it all

16:35.920 --> 16:39.040
into a chaotic mess at the first opportunity

16:39.120 --> 16:41.760
just so that something exciting could happen.

16:41.840 --> 16:47.920
And so there's the problem with a satiation vision of heaven.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.840
So that would be a vision where everyone has

16:49.920 --> 16:51.440
everything they need all the time,

16:51.520 --> 16:54.880
is that precisely when you do that with an infant

16:54.880 --> 16:58.000
or when you enter that state after Thanksgiving dinner,

16:58.080 --> 17:00.720
Christmas dinner, all you do is go to sleep.

17:00.800 --> 17:02.960
There's no reason to be conscious.

17:03.040 --> 17:06.320
Consciousness demands something like an adventure.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.920
And the classic vision of heaven does seem lacking

17:10.000 --> 17:12.640
in that it isn't obvious what you would do there.

17:12.720 --> 17:15.360
So that's something we could delve into.

17:15.440 --> 17:20.240
Then you pointed out that one of the additional

17:20.320 --> 17:24.160
underground advantages to being an apocalyptic doomsayer

17:24.240 --> 17:25.440
is that you can...

17:25.520 --> 17:27.200
I'm modifying your argument slightly,

17:27.280 --> 17:30.000
but that you can present yourself

17:30.080 --> 17:35.920
as the ultimate virtue-seeking redeemer

17:36.000 --> 17:41.760
by claiming to be obsessed by nothing but large-scale disaster.

17:41.840 --> 17:44.400
You can construe yourself as virtuous

17:44.480 --> 17:46.560
because of the depth of your concern,

17:46.640 --> 17:48.880
and you can abdicate your responsibility

17:48.960 --> 17:53.280
to actually deal with less self-dramatizing problems

17:53.360 --> 17:55.360
with the less self-dramatizing problems

17:55.440 --> 18:00.000
that actually constitute problems you could solve and address

18:00.080 --> 18:02.240
if you put your mind to it in the real world.

18:02.320 --> 18:05.760
And there's psychological reasons for assuming...

18:05.840 --> 18:09.520
One of the things you see when people's lives go seriously astray

18:09.600 --> 18:11.920
is that they don't generally...

18:12.000 --> 18:15.040
People generally don't run off a cliff

18:15.120 --> 18:17.440
immediately after doing brilliantly.

18:17.520 --> 18:20.160
What happens is they make one error,

18:20.240 --> 18:21.920
and then they make a more serious error,

18:21.920 --> 18:24.160
and then they repeat that 10,000 times,

18:24.240 --> 18:25.920
and then they're in hell.

18:26.000 --> 18:33.520
And it was their failure to rectify the mini-crisis

18:33.600 --> 18:37.520
all along the way that brings upon the apocalypse in their life.

18:37.600 --> 18:40.640
And I do see a lot of that political posturing

18:40.720 --> 18:43.760
characterizing the modern world,

18:43.840 --> 18:47.280
that people act out the role of world-redeeming savior,

18:47.360 --> 18:50.480
but they're not actually attending to genuine problems

18:50.480 --> 18:53.360
that are right in front of them that they could address

18:53.440 --> 18:56.640
if they acted responsibly.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.960
And then the final theme you developed, you said...

18:59.040 --> 19:00.160
This is very interesting.

19:00.240 --> 19:06.160
You said that the notion of natural disaster,

19:06.240 --> 19:09.520
in some sense, is ill-conceptualized

19:09.600 --> 19:15.200
because there's an ambiguity

19:15.280 --> 19:17.360
about whether, when a disaster occurs,

19:17.440 --> 19:20.800
it's a consequence of the hand of God,

19:20.880 --> 19:24.080
say, in the earthquake or the flood,

19:24.160 --> 19:26.800
or the utter failure of the authorities

19:26.880 --> 19:30.240
to have prepared properly for a foreseeable disaster.

19:30.320 --> 19:34.960
I thought this very clearly when Katrina hit New Orleans

19:35.040 --> 19:39.040
because a hue and cry went up about the catastrophe

19:39.120 --> 19:40.320
of the natural disaster,

19:40.400 --> 19:43.280
but you didn't have to dig very far before you realized

19:43.360 --> 19:46.080
that the reason that that hurricane

19:46.080 --> 19:47.920
was so devastating in New Orleans

19:48.000 --> 19:51.360
was because, well, the dykes hadn't been maintained

19:51.440 --> 19:55.120
and they'd only been built to withstand a one-in-one-century flood

19:55.200 --> 19:59.040
and that the entire infrastructure of the society was corrupt.

19:59.120 --> 20:02.880
And so, you know, in mythological representations,

20:02.960 --> 20:05.920
in deep narratives, there is an identity

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
between the evil king and the wicked queen of nature.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.680
They're the same thing.

20:11.760 --> 20:13.840
And so if the king gets wicked enough,

20:13.840 --> 20:16.320
the evil queen of nature arises.

20:16.400 --> 20:19.520
And that's a representation of the fact that

20:19.600 --> 20:21.840
if your state is corrupt,

20:21.920 --> 20:26.240
natural disaster will definitely make itself shown

20:26.320 --> 20:28.160
and that you actually can't distinguish.

20:28.240 --> 20:30.560
There's no distinction between lack of preparation

20:30.640 --> 20:32.880
and a natural disaster in the final analysis.

20:32.960 --> 20:39.520
And corruption and blindness facilitate that nexus.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.680
So the Egyptians had a story.

20:41.760 --> 20:44.320
It's the story upon which their whole culture was funded

20:44.400 --> 20:47.520
that the state corrupted, that's Osiris.

20:47.600 --> 20:52.160
The state corrupted and became willfully blind as it aged.

20:52.240 --> 20:54.800
And then it was overthrown by, that's Osiris,

20:54.880 --> 20:57.600
is overthrown by Seth, who's the precursor of Satan,

20:57.680 --> 20:58.880
and then he rules.

20:58.960 --> 21:00.800
So now the tyrant rules.

21:00.880 --> 21:04.080
And then Isis, who's the queen of the underworld,

21:04.160 --> 21:05.040
she's nature.

21:05.120 --> 21:09.200
She makes herself known again, chaos, right?

21:09.200 --> 21:13.840
With enough disintegration at the sociological level,

21:13.920 --> 21:16.400
then chaos makes itself manifest again.

21:16.480 --> 21:19.040
It's one of the most ancient stories of mankind,

21:19.120 --> 21:21.840
playing out that dichotomy between the tyrant

21:21.920 --> 21:25.280
and natural disaster that you just described.

21:25.360 --> 21:29.840
Let me take those points in order if I can.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.480
I think that the most interesting thing to me

21:32.560 --> 21:37.600
about fantasies, about the end of the world,

21:37.680 --> 21:41.040
about the various millenarian cults through history,

21:41.120 --> 21:45.760
is that they are often accompanied by certain forms

21:45.840 --> 21:49.920
of behavior that one might characterize as ascetic.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.480
So the asceticism is an important part

21:52.560 --> 21:56.640
of many religious and secular movements.

21:56.720 --> 22:02.240
So the end is approaching, the apocalypse is nearing,

22:02.320 --> 22:06.560
and therefore we should fast, or perhaps even flog ourselves,

22:06.640 --> 22:09.760
like the flagellant orders at the time of the Black Death.

22:09.840 --> 22:14.480
And it seemed to me very interesting how many similar patterns

22:14.560 --> 22:18.320
one could see in our time.

22:18.400 --> 22:22.240
Whether you are preoccupied with climate change

22:22.320 --> 22:24.960
or systemic racism doesn't matter.

22:25.040 --> 22:30.320
You should engage in some kind of ascetic atonement

22:30.400 --> 22:33.120
in advance of the Great Reckoning.

22:33.200 --> 22:40.160
And this, I think, infests a lot of contemporary progressivism.

22:40.240 --> 22:44.320
The desire to eat rabbit food,

22:44.400 --> 22:50.960
to be constantly trying to eliminate things from one's diets.

22:51.040 --> 22:58.000
The desire to engage in abstention from reproduction.

22:58.080 --> 23:02.720
We must have children because climate change is so cataclysmic.

23:02.800 --> 23:05.120
So you have these sorts of ascetic behaviors

23:05.200 --> 23:08.960
which you can find in medieval and ancient religion.

23:09.040 --> 23:11.920
So I think that's an important first point.

23:12.000 --> 23:16.720
The second point is that mythology of the sort you describe

23:16.800 --> 23:20.080
in the case of the ancient Egyptian myths

23:20.160 --> 23:23.520
makes a lot of sense if you imagine yourself living

23:23.600 --> 23:27.200
in the prehistoric or very ancient world.

23:27.280 --> 23:31.440
Life expectancy was very short.

23:31.440 --> 23:34.240
Individuals were extraordinarily at risk

23:34.320 --> 23:39.600
from a whole variety of premature forms of mortality.

23:39.680 --> 23:42.160
And the natural world was deeply mysterious

23:42.240 --> 23:46.000
because there was no scientific framework for understanding

23:46.080 --> 23:51.200
anything, the fluctuations in the level of the River Nile,

23:51.280 --> 23:57.360
the periodic droughts that afflicted early agricultural societies.

23:57.440 --> 24:00.880
And so you end up with ways of making sense of

24:00.880 --> 24:05.600
an extraordinarily cruel and capricious world.

24:05.680 --> 24:10.560
So I think that's an important reason why myths persist.

24:10.640 --> 24:16.480
They're deeply rooted in our pre-modern experience.

24:16.560 --> 24:22.960
And I think that if one tries to think about our present predicament,

24:23.040 --> 24:29.440
it's odd that such things have such enduring power over us

24:29.520 --> 24:32.640
because since the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment,

24:32.720 --> 24:36.800
we have a much better handle on the challenges

24:36.880 --> 24:42.240
that a species like ours faces on a planet like ours.

24:42.320 --> 24:46.640
So what's odd is that despite having really quite a good understanding

24:46.720 --> 24:53.280
of, say, infectious disease or the ways that hurricanes

24:53.360 --> 24:56.240
strike the Eastern seaboard of the United States,

24:56.240 --> 25:01.520
we seem to be getting worse at handling pandemics and hurricanes.

25:01.600 --> 25:04.560
And that's a really important argument that the book makes.

25:04.640 --> 25:07.600
Compared with the generation of the 1950s,

25:07.680 --> 25:10.560
the generation of the 2010s and 2020s

25:10.640 --> 25:13.280
seemed really quite bad at disaster management

25:13.360 --> 25:16.480
in most Western societies, not only the United States.

25:16.560 --> 25:19.840
It's explaining that that takes us into new territory

25:19.920 --> 25:23.280
because I don't think you can explain the diminishing competence

25:23.360 --> 25:28.160
of the modern state without having a theory of its degeneration.

25:28.240 --> 25:32.080
And that's something that is a really important part of the book.

25:32.160 --> 25:35.760
Okay, so I want to pick up on two of those topics.

25:35.840 --> 25:44.080
So the first is you point out that as the apocalyptic vision predominates,

25:44.160 --> 25:46.640
there's a turn to asceticism.

25:46.720 --> 25:50.000
And then you describe, we could say, veganism and vegetarianism.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.520
And the insistence by the environmentalists

25:53.600 --> 25:55.440
that we must engage in degrowth

25:55.520 --> 25:57.520
and that we must produce our standard of living.

25:57.600 --> 26:04.560
And yes, okay, but there's a very interesting psychological rationale

26:04.640 --> 26:12.640
for that as well, which is that if the old state of being has become corrupt,

26:12.720 --> 26:13.680
so that's the old king.

26:13.760 --> 26:17.600
And now we're threatened by its collapse,

26:17.600 --> 26:26.240
then the proper thing to do is to engage in repentance and atonement

26:26.320 --> 26:32.480
because what you want to do is you want to offer up your stupid preconceptions

26:32.560 --> 26:36.240
to be destroyed so that you can rectify the corruption

26:36.320 --> 26:38.640
so that you can stave off the disaster.

26:38.720 --> 26:44.560
And so now it's interesting because with the millenarian

26:44.640 --> 26:46.400
and apocalyptic movements on the left,

26:46.480 --> 26:49.040
you have a simultaneous insistence

26:49.120 --> 26:55.280
that all sorts of impulsive, pleasure-seeking, licentious behavior

26:55.360 --> 26:59.040
should be centered and prioritized and celebrated.

26:59.120 --> 27:01.520
But at the same time, you have this insistence

27:01.600 --> 27:05.360
that there's a certain kind of asceticism that's also necessary.

27:05.440 --> 27:07.680
And I see in that as a psychologist,

27:07.760 --> 27:14.080
I see that as a proper mechanism of repair gone astray.

27:14.400 --> 27:21.360
Is that, well, you should always be cutting back in this ascetic way

27:21.440 --> 27:27.120
on your idiot excesses locally to improve the manner

27:27.200 --> 27:28.560
in which you conceptualize the world.

27:28.640 --> 27:31.200
That's the continual sacrificial offering

27:31.280 --> 27:34.240
of your own insufficiency and your own stupidity.

27:34.320 --> 27:37.360
And that does renew the world.

27:37.440 --> 27:40.400
And so, but now we've got this dynamic

27:40.480 --> 27:44.240
where we globalize the apocalypse.

27:44.320 --> 27:46.320
We view the end of the world.

27:46.400 --> 27:50.880
We assume that nothing but a kind of universal asceticism

27:50.960 --> 27:52.960
and atonement will suffice.

27:53.040 --> 27:55.840
That enables us to set local concerns aside,

27:55.920 --> 27:58.400
as we already discussed, and to act irresponsibly.

27:58.480 --> 28:03.280
And maybe that's part of what's producing this inability

28:03.280 --> 28:08.880
to actually respond locally and effectively to genuine problems.

28:08.960 --> 28:10.560
You know, in the Old Testament,

28:10.640 --> 28:16.160
there's a second commandment is to not use God's name in vain.

28:16.240 --> 28:18.640
And what that means, as far as I can tell,

28:18.720 --> 28:22.320
is that you shouldn't claim divine motivation

28:22.400 --> 28:25.360
for doing things that are actually self-serving.

28:25.440 --> 28:27.280
You shouldn't attribute sacred motivations

28:27.360 --> 28:33.120
to your own instrumental, impulsive, and self-serving behavior.

28:33.200 --> 28:35.280
And then that's echoed in the New Testament

28:35.360 --> 28:38.000
with the insistence that you shouldn't pray in public.

28:38.080 --> 28:41.840
Now, if you take on the apocalyptic burden and you're virtuous

28:41.920 --> 28:47.680
only in consequence of your compassionate concern,

28:47.760 --> 28:51.920
it gives you a perfect excuse to dispense with local responsibility.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.160
And if you dispense with local responsibility,

28:54.240 --> 28:56.880
then you're no longer able to engage

28:56.960 --> 28:59.280
in the concrete problem-solving activities

28:59.360 --> 29:00.560
of the sort that you described.

29:00.640 --> 29:03.920
I mean, what did you conclude when you have a chapter

29:04.000 --> 29:05.840
on developing political incompetence

29:05.920 --> 29:10.080
and also one on a sort of a belief in scientism?

29:10.160 --> 29:12.080
And that seems to me to be part of your attempt

29:12.160 --> 29:15.120
to assess the local failure

29:15.200 --> 29:17.680
while we're concentrating on the global apocalypse.

29:17.760 --> 29:19.280
And so what do you make of that,

29:19.360 --> 29:23.360
that concatenation of causal forces?

29:23.360 --> 29:26.720
There are two things that are going on, I think.

29:26.800 --> 29:32.960
One is that the more people refer to the science,

29:33.040 --> 29:35.920
the more you should suspect that they are engaged

29:36.000 --> 29:39.680
in some quasi-religious activity.

29:39.760 --> 29:43.920
Because the notion of some settled body of knowledge

29:44.000 --> 29:46.960
called the science is at odds with the reality

29:47.040 --> 29:50.400
of the scientific method, which is a constant struggle

29:50.480 --> 29:53.280
to falsify hypotheses through experimentation.

29:54.880 --> 29:58.080
During the COVID-19 pandemic, but I think it predates it,

29:58.160 --> 30:00.240
it was already going on in debates about climate,

30:00.320 --> 30:03.520
there was a lot of spurious invocation of the science.

30:04.240 --> 30:08.880
And one might as well have been saying the gods or the deity,

30:08.960 --> 30:13.440
because it was, in fact, quite unscientific thinking

30:13.520 --> 30:14.160
that was going on.

30:14.240 --> 30:15.760
I'll give you an illustration of this.

30:16.560 --> 30:20.560
A great delusion is to imagine that we can prevent

30:20.640 --> 30:24.320
the rise of average temperatures by large scale

30:24.400 --> 30:25.760
asceticism in the West.

30:26.800 --> 30:29.760
We must give up internal combustion engines.

30:29.840 --> 30:31.920
We should give up eating meat and so on.

30:32.640 --> 30:37.840
If we end up buying electric vehicles and solar cells

30:37.920 --> 30:41.840
manufactured in China with electricity generated

30:41.920 --> 30:44.240
by burning ever larger quantities of coal,

30:44.800 --> 30:49.040
the probability of reducing average temperatures is zero.

30:50.320 --> 30:55.200
Because that is, in fact, the perfect illustration

30:55.840 --> 30:58.720
of wrongheadedness in action.

30:59.680 --> 31:03.040
If one accepts the premises of the debates

31:03.120 --> 31:05.280
on the causes of rising temperatures,

31:05.360 --> 31:09.120
it makes no sense at all for us to behave this way.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.520
Our asceticism will make no difference

31:12.080 --> 31:15.600
if it manifests itself as increased burning of coal in China.

31:15.680 --> 31:17.200
So that's the first thing that's going on.

31:17.280 --> 31:20.640
I mean, like, well, or increased burning in coal in Germany,

31:20.720 --> 31:23.440
because that's what's happened with the Green Revolution in Germany.

31:23.520 --> 31:24.000
Exactly.

31:24.080 --> 31:27.840
They shut off the nuclear plants and started up the Lignite plant.

31:27.920 --> 31:33.920
So this kind of wrongheadedness leads to all kinds of policy errors

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
because people have focused on the satisfaction of asceticism,

31:38.000 --> 31:42.960
the virtue signaling that comes with getting rid of nuclear power stations

31:43.040 --> 31:45.040
or internal combustion engines.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.440
So there's a kind of generalized failure,

31:47.520 --> 31:51.280
which embraces the policy elite to think rationally

31:51.360 --> 31:54.080
about the problems that we're trying to address.

31:54.160 --> 31:56.640
The second problem, which I think is just as important,

31:56.720 --> 31:58.960
is the way the administrative state functions.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.840
If you compare central governments today

32:01.920 --> 32:05.520
with their counterparts of half a century or 70 years ago,

32:05.520 --> 32:06.880
they've become much larger.

32:06.960 --> 32:09.920
They're bloated in terms of the numbers of people employed.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.800
They intervene in many more ways.

32:14.880 --> 32:19.040
There's an enormous corpus of regulation in all western countries.

32:20.240 --> 32:25.040
This administrative state, unwieldy regulatory, is very inefficient.

32:25.120 --> 32:28.160
It's very bad at achieving its intended goals.

32:29.120 --> 32:31.840
That has to do with the way that bureaucracy works

32:31.920 --> 32:36.160
and the sclerotic tendencies that the modern state suffers from.

32:36.240 --> 32:41.680
So between the science as a quasi-religious way of thinking

32:42.400 --> 32:44.000
and the administrative state,

32:44.080 --> 32:46.560
we have a very, very dysfunctional approach

32:46.640 --> 32:49.200
to nearly all the problems that confront us.

32:49.280 --> 32:51.920
And that is really the central argument of doom.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.480
It's very significant that in our lifetimes,

32:55.200 --> 32:58.880
governments have got worse at dealing with disasters, not better.

32:58.960 --> 33:01.280
Despite the accumulation of scientific knowledge,

33:01.280 --> 33:05.520
we seem somehow, collectively, to be worse at scientific thinking.

33:06.960 --> 33:08.880
The holidays are rapidly approaching,

33:08.960 --> 33:12.640
but we can find peace and calm in the craziness of the season with Hallow,

33:12.720 --> 33:15.520
the number one Christian prayer app in the world.

33:15.600 --> 33:18.320
Immerse yourself in Christmas and Advent prayers,

33:18.400 --> 33:20.960
meditations, and peaceful Christmas music.

33:21.040 --> 33:24.480
Hallow also offers an extensive library of Bible reading plans

33:24.560 --> 33:28.160
accompanied by insightful reflections and audio-guided meditations.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.960
Whether you're a seasoned Bible reader or just starting your journey,

33:30.960 --> 33:34.960
Hallow provides a platform for you to engage with Scripture like never before.

33:35.040 --> 33:38.640
A great place to start is with Father Mike Schmitz's Bible in a Year,

33:38.720 --> 33:42.880
in which he offers brief daily readings and reflections available on the Hallow app.

33:42.960 --> 33:46.560
The Hallow app also helps you connect with a community of like-minded individuals

33:46.640 --> 33:51.120
sharing experiences, insights, and encouragement along the path to spiritual growth.

33:51.200 --> 33:55.440
This Christmas, join Hallow's Christmas Prayer Challenge, Advent with C.S. Lewis.

33:55.520 --> 33:57.760
For the 25 days leading up to Christmas,

33:57.760 --> 34:02.000
you can focus on the real reason for the season with prayer, meditation,

34:02.080 --> 34:04.240
and Christmas music on Hallow.

34:04.320 --> 34:08.800
Download the app for free at Hallow.com slash Jordan for three months free.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.040
That's Hallow.com slash Jordan.

34:14.320 --> 34:17.920
Okay, so imagine this.

34:18.000 --> 34:24.800
You magnify the size of the apocalypse, so it becomes a world-ending ragnarok.

34:24.880 --> 34:27.440
Then you magnify the size of the bureaucratic state

34:27.440 --> 34:31.520
because you have to in order to deal with that apocalypse.

34:31.600 --> 34:36.240
Okay, then because the state is so global and large and so central,

34:36.320 --> 34:38.640
it loses its connection with the real world.

34:38.720 --> 34:43.280
It has no subsidiary organization, and then it flails about pointlessly.

34:43.360 --> 34:47.280
Now, I'm going to walk through a couple of narrative representations of that,

34:47.360 --> 34:49.760
and it'll tie it back to the imagery of Revelation.

34:49.840 --> 34:51.120
You might find this interesting.

34:51.200 --> 34:54.720
So you see that dynamic play out in the opening chapters of Genesis,

34:54.720 --> 34:58.080
because what you have is the descendants of Cain.

34:58.160 --> 35:02.240
So Cain makes improper sacrifices, and he becomes bitter and resentful,

35:02.320 --> 35:03.840
and he turns to technology.

35:03.920 --> 35:07.600
It's Cain's descendants that turn to technology first.

35:07.680 --> 35:11.120
They build the first cities, and then the city becomes corrupt.

35:11.200 --> 35:14.640
It becomes corrupt in the direction of the Tower of Babel.

35:14.720 --> 35:17.440
Now, the Tower of Babel is a ziggurat.

35:17.520 --> 35:21.520
It's a stepped pyramid, and at that time,

35:21.600 --> 35:26.160
the potentates of the Middle East were competing to build the largest ziggurats.

35:26.240 --> 35:30.640
They were trying to build towers to heaven to glorify themselves,

35:30.720 --> 35:34.000
and that's the subtext of the Tower of Babel story.

35:34.080 --> 35:40.160
So what happens is that the ultimate Tower of Babel is erected to reach to the sky,

35:40.240 --> 35:44.640
and that's a challenge to the supremacy of God.

35:44.720 --> 35:49.520
And the consequence of that is that the cosmos,

35:49.520 --> 35:56.640
the spirit of the cosmos, the creative producer of the cosmos,

35:56.720 --> 36:01.120
makes all those who inhabit the Tower unable to communicate with one another.

36:01.200 --> 36:05.520
So they start to lose even the ability to share concepts,

36:05.600 --> 36:07.440
and this structure collapses.

36:07.520 --> 36:12.000
And it's because that Tower of Babel is too large, it reaches too high,

36:12.080 --> 36:14.960
it's too uniform, and it's destined to failure.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.840
Because that begs the question, what's the alternative to that?

36:17.840 --> 36:21.520
But I would say the entire remaining biblical corpus

36:21.600 --> 36:24.560
is actually an attempt to answer that question, but it's very germane.

36:24.640 --> 36:29.440
Now, that imagery is picked up again in the Book of Revelation.

36:29.520 --> 36:33.680
So one of the central images in the book that I think is very relevant,

36:33.760 --> 36:39.680
imagine that the Book of Revelation is trying to conceptualize the apocalypse as such,

36:39.760 --> 36:44.800
the manner in which things deteriorate before the ultimate disaster.

36:44.880 --> 36:48.880
And so one of the main images is of a seven-headed beast,

36:48.960 --> 36:52.400
and on the back of the beast is the horror of Babylon.

36:52.480 --> 37:00.160
And it's an image of a centralizing state,

37:00.240 --> 37:03.360
a centralizing, a monstrous centralizing state,

37:03.440 --> 37:05.520
that's a good way of thinking about it,

37:05.600 --> 37:14.720
with multiple heads, with something like disinhibited licentiousness as its partner.

37:14.880 --> 37:16.080
That's the image.

37:16.160 --> 37:18.720
And so the notion there is that when things deteriorate

37:18.800 --> 37:21.120
to the point where apocalypse is likely,

37:21.200 --> 37:26.960
you have the construction of monstrous state-like apparatuses

37:27.040 --> 37:33.920
aligned with individual fragmentation down to the point of licentious atomization.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.920
That's a good way of thinking about it.

37:36.000 --> 37:40.320
So you're striving towards, it seems to me in your argument,

37:40.400 --> 37:42.560
you're striving towards the hypothesis

37:42.560 --> 37:46.640
that there's something like an out-of-control gigantism

37:46.720 --> 37:55.040
that's causally related to the inability of these bureaucratic organizations

37:55.120 --> 37:58.880
to actually respond to actual occurrences in the world.

37:58.960 --> 38:01.040
So two thoughts.

38:01.120 --> 38:02.400
There's only one law of history.

38:02.480 --> 38:07.280
I'm a historian, and that's the law of unintended consequences.

38:07.360 --> 38:11.600
And so what typically happens is that well-intentioned people

38:11.760 --> 38:16.400
come to power, identify a problem which they feel they must address,

38:16.480 --> 38:19.680
and they undertake measures to address the problem

38:19.760 --> 38:21.520
which have unintended consequences.

38:21.600 --> 38:24.560
This was true when back in the 1960s and 70s,

38:24.640 --> 38:27.840
people persuaded themselves that there was a terrible problem of overpopulation

38:27.920 --> 38:29.920
that Malthus was going to be vindicated,

38:30.000 --> 38:33.440
and therefore there had to be drastic population control, especially in Asia.

38:33.520 --> 38:37.120
And that turned out to have all kinds of unintended consequences.

38:37.120 --> 38:42.800
In our time, fears not just of climate change,

38:42.880 --> 38:48.480
but of dangerous technological developments have given rise

38:48.560 --> 38:53.040
to a view which my friend Nick Bostrom and Oxford exemplifies,

38:53.120 --> 38:56.880
that we need to have very, very powerful surveillance powers

38:56.960 --> 38:59.920
to prevent bad things from happening,

39:00.000 --> 39:03.200
whether it's to prevent CO2 emissions

39:03.280 --> 39:08.800
in reaching the levels of the net zero program,

39:08.880 --> 39:11.520
or whether it's to stop dangerous research

39:11.600 --> 39:13.760
being done with artificial intelligence,

39:13.840 --> 39:18.320
we need to empower the state to have even greater powers of surveillance

39:18.400 --> 39:21.440
than the mid-20th century totalitarian regimes had.

39:21.520 --> 39:24.320
And so one of the key arguments in the book DOOM is that

39:24.400 --> 39:29.040
actually totalitarianism is the thing most to be feared.

39:29.120 --> 39:33.600
In the 20th century, totalitarian regimes caused way more premature death

39:33.680 --> 39:35.120
than anything else.

39:35.200 --> 39:38.000
And so the last thing we should want to do in the 21st century

39:38.080 --> 39:40.800
is to create new forms of totalitarianism

39:40.880 --> 39:46.160
out of the belief that only an all-seeing state can prevent disaster.

39:46.240 --> 39:49.520
So this is a really, really important argument that the book makes,

39:49.600 --> 39:52.880
and I think it's become even more relevant with the major breakthroughs

39:52.960 --> 39:58.720
we've seen in artificial intelligence in the two years since the book was published.

39:58.720 --> 40:04.160
The other thing that I would say is we want the universe to be moral.

40:04.240 --> 40:08.240
We are very strongly inclined to think when bad things happen to us

40:08.320 --> 40:14.000
that they may in fact be retribution for sins that we committed in the past.

40:14.080 --> 40:20.720
And even the most rational individual is susceptible to this idea.

40:20.800 --> 40:25.520
I know this because my parents did their very best to raise me

40:25.600 --> 40:30.960
as a product of the Scottish Enlightenment, an atheist and a devoted believer

40:31.040 --> 40:32.320
in the scientific method.

40:32.400 --> 40:35.440
But when bad things happen, I have this uneasy sense

40:35.520 --> 40:39.840
that I may have brought it upon myself by transgressing in some way,

40:39.920 --> 40:43.680
illustrating that you can't really escape the Christian legacy

40:43.760 --> 40:50.000
unless you travel a very long, long way away from post-Christian civilizations.

40:50.080 --> 40:52.400
Now, it's not, in fact, a moral universe.

40:52.480 --> 40:54.480
This is the bad news.

40:54.560 --> 40:55.280
It's really not.

40:55.360 --> 40:59.040
I mean, a lot of the bad things that happen are random.

40:59.120 --> 41:01.440
They're governed by power laws.

41:01.520 --> 41:03.600
They're extremely difficult to predict.

41:03.680 --> 41:07.200
Wars are, in fact, pretty randomly distributed.

41:07.280 --> 41:10.960
There's no cycle of history that tells you when a war is coming.

41:11.040 --> 41:13.440
Same applies to financial crises.

41:13.520 --> 41:17.200
Wildfires and earthquakes are not normally distributed.

41:17.280 --> 41:20.560
They can't really be thought of in probabilistic terms.

41:20.640 --> 41:23.440
And so much of the terrible stuff that happens to us

41:23.520 --> 41:28.240
has nothing to do with there being a moral universe.

41:28.320 --> 41:32.800
A cancer may strike one of us down in a much shorter timeframe

41:32.880 --> 41:36.000
than we're both tacitly assuming we have.

41:36.080 --> 41:40.960
And if we are diagnosed with a terminal cancer,

41:41.040 --> 41:42.640
how will we react to that news?

41:42.720 --> 41:44.960
What if I hear this tomorrow?

41:45.040 --> 41:47.520
It'll be a tremendous shock to me,

41:47.520 --> 41:52.240
mainly because it will render my younger children

41:52.320 --> 41:54.720
much more vulnerable in my absence.

41:54.800 --> 41:56.640
But will I be able to resist the temptation

41:56.720 --> 41:58.080
that I brought it upon myself?

41:58.160 --> 42:00.720
It'll be there in the back of my mind

42:00.800 --> 42:06.000
because I've just inherited from generations that way of thinking.

42:06.080 --> 42:10.400
And it's worth adding one little footnote to this.

42:10.480 --> 42:12.320
My friend, the historian Tom Holland,

42:12.400 --> 42:16.080
wrote a nice book recently, Dominion, arguing that

42:16.160 --> 42:18.320
Christian ways of thinking about the world

42:18.400 --> 42:24.400
have outlived Christianity in these secular times that we inhabit.

42:24.480 --> 42:26.720
A very good illustration of this point

42:26.800 --> 42:30.240
is how much Calvinism is still out there.

42:30.320 --> 42:33.520
The belief that you belong to the elect,

42:33.600 --> 42:35.440
the people because of predestination

42:35.520 --> 42:39.600
who are insured of salvation, is a very powerful one.

42:39.680 --> 42:42.960
And it persists long after people have ceased to attend

42:43.040 --> 42:45.440
Calvinist church services.

42:45.520 --> 42:48.640
I'm always impressed by the presence

42:48.720 --> 42:52.640
of the self-appointed elect in academic life.

42:52.720 --> 42:56.080
People who have a sense that they are morally superior

42:56.160 --> 42:59.600
to those around them, they do belong to an elite.

42:59.680 --> 43:06.480
And their behavior should be, as it were, fitting to that preeminence.

43:06.560 --> 43:09.280
Now, I am a kind of Calvinist atheist.

43:09.360 --> 43:10.720
I come from the west of Scotland

43:10.800 --> 43:13.600
where that kind of thinking was very well established.

43:13.680 --> 43:17.440
I can see the people who think they belong to the elect

43:17.520 --> 43:21.040
all around me in American academic life.

43:21.120 --> 43:23.760
And, of course, the critical idea

43:23.840 --> 43:27.120
which Robert Louis Stevenson gets at in the Master of Ballon Trey

43:27.200 --> 43:30.960
and James Hogg gets in the Confessions of a Justified Sinner

43:31.040 --> 43:33.200
is that the elect are the worst people.

43:33.280 --> 43:36.560
It's the people who think that they belong to the elite

43:36.640 --> 43:39.920
who turn out to be capable of the most diabolical acts.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.920
So, you know, if you have that feeling

43:42.000 --> 43:44.400
that you might belong to the elect,

43:44.480 --> 43:46.560
disabuse yourself of that notion

43:46.640 --> 43:49.760
because it often empowers dreadful acts of cruelty.

43:51.520 --> 43:53.120
Starting a business can be tough,

43:53.200 --> 43:55.840
especially knowing how to run your online storefront.

43:55.920 --> 43:58.560

44:44.240 --> 44:46.640
That's Shopify.com-JBP.

44:50.720 --> 44:54.640
I presume that's why the Gospel in Joinder

44:54.720 --> 44:57.200
is that the last will be first, right,

44:57.280 --> 44:58.480
and the first will be last.

44:58.560 --> 45:00.160
It's pointing to something like that.

45:00.240 --> 45:01.920
There's a couple of themes you developed.

45:02.000 --> 45:08.320
So you pointed out that it's often the reaction to a crisis

45:08.320 --> 45:09.840
that's worse than the crisis,

45:09.920 --> 45:12.880
and you pointed to the law of unintended consequences

45:12.960 --> 45:14.000
as the cause of that.

45:14.080 --> 45:18.560
And I think there's something technically true about that

45:18.640 --> 45:22.400
in that there isn't a very large number

45:22.480 --> 45:26.080
of possible consequences of any given act.

45:26.160 --> 45:30.160
And the probability that you can specify the consequence

45:30.240 --> 45:32.640
you want and only that consequence

45:32.720 --> 45:36.480
diminishes with the complexity of the action.

45:37.440 --> 45:41.200
And you can see even systems as sophisticated

45:41.280 --> 45:44.320
as the immune system falling prey

45:44.400 --> 45:47.120
to the law of unintended consequences

45:47.200 --> 45:50.800
because sometimes people die when they're infected

45:50.880 --> 45:53.680
by an organism because the immune system overreacts.

45:53.760 --> 45:57.440
And the COVID overreaction was a generalized

45:57.520 --> 45:59.920
social immune system overreaction,

46:00.000 --> 46:05.680
and it was much worse than the hypothetical crisis itself.

46:05.920 --> 46:09.360
But what I wanted to focus on was the reason

46:09.440 --> 46:12.080
that that overreach occurs.

46:12.160 --> 46:16.800
Now, I've been writing a book about biblical narratives,

46:16.880 --> 46:18.160
so they're very much on my mind,

46:18.240 --> 46:19.760
and that's partly why I'm bringing them up.

46:19.840 --> 46:23.520
But I talked to a good friend of mine and his brother,

46:23.600 --> 46:26.560
Jonathan Pascio and Matthew Pascio,

46:26.640 --> 46:31.600
about the first apocalyptic cataclysm

46:31.680 --> 46:33.760
as it's laid out in the book of Genesis,

46:33.840 --> 46:38.000
and that's the Sin of Eve and the Consequent Sin of Adam.

46:38.080 --> 46:41.920
Their view is that the Sin of Eve is one of pride,

46:42.000 --> 46:45.840
is that she encounters the serpent who turns out to be Satan.

46:45.920 --> 46:50.480
So it's the possibility of predation

46:50.560 --> 46:54.400
and natural catastrophe allied with the possibility of evil.

46:54.480 --> 46:56.720
That's a good way of thinking about it symbolically.

46:56.800 --> 47:00.160
And her first presumption

47:00.160 --> 47:05.040
is that she can encompass that and hearken to it

47:05.120 --> 47:08.480
and listen to its voice and integrate it.

47:08.560 --> 47:10.880
And that's what produces the fall.

47:10.960 --> 47:14.240
And Adam's Consequent Sin, as he agrees with Eve,

47:14.320 --> 47:17.280
and I would say mostly to try to impress her,

47:17.360 --> 47:19.760
which speaks very deeply to the motivation of men.

47:19.840 --> 47:23.680
And so there's this notion, it's a very, very interesting notion.

47:23.760 --> 47:25.280
And I'd like to know what you make of it,

47:25.280 --> 47:30.640
is that the fundamental reason that cataclysms occur,

47:30.720 --> 47:35.920
and I guess this is an objection to your theory of an amoral world.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.920
So we'll see where this goes,

47:38.000 --> 47:40.720
is that it's people's overreaching pride

47:40.800 --> 47:43.680
that is the eternal precursor to the fall.

47:43.760 --> 47:45.440
You know, pride goes before a fall.

47:45.520 --> 47:49.360
But it's this notion that we can fight off more than we can chew,

47:49.440 --> 47:54.880
that we can encapsulate and control more than we're really competent to.

47:54.880 --> 47:59.280
We have an over-expansive vision of our competence.

47:59.360 --> 48:03.360
We trumpet that to parade our moral virtue.

48:03.440 --> 48:08.640
It motivates us to overextend ourselves in places we shouldn't.

48:08.720 --> 48:14.240
And the constant consequence of that is systemic collapse

48:14.320 --> 48:15.600
at different scales.

48:15.680 --> 48:18.400
And so it begs the question, you know, I've really wondered about this,

48:18.480 --> 48:25.440
and you know, if you, I think it's something to meditate on,

48:25.520 --> 48:28.640
if you didn't overreach in your life,

48:28.720 --> 48:34.960
you know, if you were properly humble in your claims of mastery,

48:35.040 --> 48:38.080
if you only dealt with what was local

48:38.160 --> 48:40.160
and that was within your bounds of competence,

48:40.240 --> 48:43.760
you know, maybe extending yourself a bit to learn,

48:43.840 --> 48:47.280
maybe you wouldn't bring on yourself a continual sequence

48:47.280 --> 48:49.920
of relatively apocalyptic catastrophes, right?

48:50.000 --> 48:52.560
It's like, and you pointed to that at the end

48:52.640 --> 48:54.000
of your last sequence of comments.

48:54.080 --> 48:56.720
You know, you said, there's a tension there.

48:56.800 --> 48:59.440
You said, well, the universe is full of random events

48:59.520 --> 49:01.520
and it's not essentially moral.

49:01.600 --> 49:05.680
But you also said, but we overreach constantly

49:05.760 --> 49:09.360
and that does produce, you know, various forms of cataclysm.

49:09.440 --> 49:13.440
So I would say, see, there's a paradox in those two viewpoints

49:13.440 --> 49:15.360
because how about this?

49:15.440 --> 49:18.720
Is how about our immorality makes us more susceptible

49:18.800 --> 49:22.240
to the random fluctuations of the world, right?

49:22.320 --> 49:24.960
That joins those two visions together.

49:25.040 --> 49:29.920
I think it's rather different from the way you've put it.

49:30.000 --> 49:37.120
It's often people with a strong sense of morality who overreach.

49:37.200 --> 49:38.800
Humility is important.

49:38.880 --> 49:40.720
We need to be humble about our ability

49:40.800 --> 49:42.880
to predict the consequences of our actions.

49:42.960 --> 49:47.520
It's a nonlinear world, but we are quite linear thinkers

49:47.600 --> 49:50.560
and we love to say other things being equal,

49:50.640 --> 49:54.400
this act will have the following consequence.

49:54.480 --> 49:59.120
But of course, other things are not equal in a complex system.

49:59.200 --> 50:02.080
Let me give you an illustration of this point,

50:02.160 --> 50:04.720
which is currently in people's minds

50:04.800 --> 50:08.960
because of the success of the movie Oppenheimer.

50:09.040 --> 50:12.560
Oppie Oppenheimer was a very moral individual,

50:12.640 --> 50:17.840
at least he felt himself to be rooted in an ethical education

50:17.920 --> 50:20.960
that he'd had at an elite school in New York,

50:21.040 --> 50:30.800
drawn out of those ethical premises towards communism in the 1930s.

50:30.880 --> 50:35.440
But when given the challenge to build an atomic bomb

50:35.520 --> 50:39.120
in order to win World War II,

50:39.200 --> 50:44.720
he embraced that challenge and achieved it with astonishing brilliance,

50:44.800 --> 50:49.120
brilliance both as a scientist and as it turned out as a leader of scientists.

50:49.200 --> 50:53.920
But he quickly began to see, after the bomb had been dropped

50:54.000 --> 50:59.120
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that there were unintended consequences.

50:59.200 --> 51:01.680
He was unable to prevent the arms race

51:01.680 --> 51:05.360
that soon broke out between the United States and the Soviet Union.

51:05.440 --> 51:10.960
He was unable to prevent the invention of the thermonuclear bomb, the super.

51:11.040 --> 51:16.640
He lost the arguments about the development of nuclear weapons.

51:16.720 --> 51:18.960
And if one looks back at that era,

51:19.040 --> 51:24.160
the single most amazing thing to me about that breakthrough

51:24.240 --> 51:28.160
is that we have subsequently made so much more use

51:28.240 --> 51:31.840
of the destructive potential of nuclear fission

51:31.920 --> 51:34.400
than of its productive potential.

51:34.480 --> 51:40.000
We've built many, many more nuclear warheads than nuclear reactors.

51:40.080 --> 51:43.440
That illustrates, I think, very powerfully the law of unintended consequences.

51:43.520 --> 51:48.080
But it began with an individual, Oppenheimer,

51:48.160 --> 51:51.280
who was filled with a sense of his own morality

51:51.360 --> 51:54.800
and took that sense with him to the grave.

51:54.880 --> 51:57.360
Right, okay, but maybe that, okay,

51:57.440 --> 51:59.520
but you're pointing to something there

51:59.600 --> 52:01.600
that is akin to a point you made earlier,

52:01.680 --> 52:06.480
is that you said that he was filled with a sense of his own morality.

52:06.560 --> 52:10.880
And I can understand why that might be associated

52:10.960 --> 52:13.680
with the totalitarian temptation

52:13.760 --> 52:17.120
of religious dogmatism and Calvinism, let's say.

52:17.200 --> 52:20.480
But I could say, perhaps I could say in response,

52:20.560 --> 52:22.160
he should have been filled instead

52:22.240 --> 52:26.160
with a sense of his own potential sinfulness, right?

52:26.240 --> 52:27.360
And I would also say that,

52:27.440 --> 52:28.880
and you can tell me what you think about this,

52:28.960 --> 52:31.600
because these are ideas that I'm just trying to develop,

52:31.680 --> 52:35.360
is that you already told me that as far as you're concerned,

52:35.440 --> 52:38.800
it's the very people who regard themselves as the elect and the saved

52:38.880 --> 52:42.640
and the already moral who are most likely to overreach

52:42.720 --> 52:44.480
and who present the biggest danger.

52:44.560 --> 52:47.040
You followed that up with a description of Oppenheimer, right?

52:47.120 --> 52:50.560
This incredible Luciferian intellect,

52:50.560 --> 52:54.000
and that's the proper symbolic representation

52:54.080 --> 52:57.760
who engaged in this world-destroying scheme

52:57.840 --> 52:59.920
and then was potentially world-destroying scheme

53:00.000 --> 53:01.840
and was unable to control it.

53:01.920 --> 53:05.840
But you characterized him as convinced of his own moral virtue.

53:05.920 --> 53:08.080
So I would say, okay, well, if that's the problem,

53:08.160 --> 53:11.840
maybe he should have been convinced of the opposite of that,

53:11.920 --> 53:15.680
which would be his intrinsic insufficiency and sinfulness.

53:15.760 --> 53:19.360
Now, there is a continual injunction throughout the biblical corpus

53:19.440 --> 53:20.800
to do precisely that.

53:20.880 --> 53:22.880
And the reason I'm bringing that up, too,

53:22.960 --> 53:26.800
is because something else that you said begs a question, you know?

53:26.880 --> 53:31.600
If the law of unintended consequence rules,

53:31.680 --> 53:37.200
then under what conditions is action, any action, not overreach, right?

53:37.280 --> 53:40.240
Because you could say, this is combinatorial explosion,

53:40.320 --> 53:46.080
you can't predict the consequence of any action, and yet you have to act.

53:46.160 --> 53:48.640
And so then the question emerges,

53:48.640 --> 53:50.800
well, since you have to act,

53:50.880 --> 53:55.440
but there's the danger of exponentially cascading unintended consequences,

53:55.520 --> 53:58.080
in what spirit should you act?

53:58.160 --> 54:01.040
And you've already pointed out, well, it shouldn't be in the spirit

54:01.120 --> 54:07.600
of smug, self-satisfied, Calvinistic, dogmatic certainty in your moral right.

54:07.680 --> 54:08.800
Well, then what should it be?

54:08.880 --> 54:11.360
Well, hopefully it should be the opposite of that.

54:11.440 --> 54:14.400
You know, and that is a kind of radical humility, right?

54:14.480 --> 54:17.200
It's an openness to the possibility of error.

54:17.200 --> 54:20.000
I mean, I don't know exactly how those things should be calibrated,

54:20.080 --> 54:22.720
but because we do have to act,

54:22.800 --> 54:25.120
and it does seem to me that there is a domain of action.

54:25.200 --> 54:30.560
Like, what do you think it was that Oppenheimer did wrong, fundamentally?

54:30.640 --> 54:34.080
I mean, I characterize his intellect as Luciferian, right?

54:34.160 --> 54:40.880
He's reaching for a power that, in principle,

54:40.960 --> 54:43.440
I don't know if it should have been forever off limits.

54:43.520 --> 54:45.520
I have no idea how to adjudicate that.

54:45.520 --> 54:50.640
But you have a sense that Oppenheimer himself recognized that he had,

54:50.720 --> 54:54.400
it wasn't that he had too much faith in the comprehensiveness of his intellect,

54:54.480 --> 54:57.120
that he was too tempted by the power that was offered to him

54:57.200 --> 55:01.280
as a consequence of being developer of this immense weapon.

55:01.360 --> 55:03.440
Where do you think he went wrong?

55:03.520 --> 55:06.720
That's key to the question of where science itself goes wrong.

55:06.800 --> 55:09.360
I should be, I haven't watched the movie,

55:09.440 --> 55:12.000
but I read the book American Prometheus.

55:12.080 --> 55:14.800
I prefer books to movies.

55:14.960 --> 55:19.280
And the book makes it clear that what Oppenheimer got wrong

55:19.360 --> 55:22.800
was to flirt with communism.

55:22.880 --> 55:28.320
And that was wrong because it was the moment when he set aside

55:28.400 --> 55:33.840
his scientific judgment and drank at least some of the snake oil

55:33.920 --> 55:38.320
that the Soviet regime was successfully exporting in the 1930s.

55:38.400 --> 55:41.920
This was a terrible mistake that ultimately undermined his credibility

55:42.000 --> 55:48.480
and limited his power to steer the course of the nuclear race.

55:48.560 --> 55:52.400
What he got right was to develop a bomb that could end World War II

55:52.480 --> 55:55.600
without the need for a large-scale conventional forces invasion of Japan

55:55.680 --> 56:01.520
which would have cost untold numbers of American soldiers' lives.

56:01.600 --> 56:04.000
And I think it's very important to emphasize

56:04.080 --> 56:07.280
that if Oppenheimer had said to himself,

56:07.360 --> 56:15.040
I must be humble and resist the temptation to win this race.

56:15.120 --> 56:18.640
And of course, a number of physicists did take that view

56:18.720 --> 56:21.040
and refused to participate in the Manhattan Project.

56:21.120 --> 56:22.880
It might have been disastrous.

56:22.960 --> 56:28.320
I constantly try to remind people in the work I've done on the Second World War

56:28.400 --> 56:32.640
that the Axis powers, the Totalitarian powers, nearly won that war.

56:32.720 --> 56:36.320
And it took tremendous creativity by a whole range of scientists,

56:36.320 --> 56:40.320
not only Oppenheimer, but think of touring those cryptographers

56:40.400 --> 56:45.600
who did such a crucial job of making sure that the Allied powers cracked

56:45.680 --> 56:47.360
or the Axis powers codes.

56:47.440 --> 56:52.560
It took a huge effort to win that war.

56:52.640 --> 56:59.840
The critical thing, I think, comes from another secular Jewish intellect,

56:59.920 --> 57:04.480
Henry Kissinger, whose biography I've spent a large part of my career writing.

57:04.720 --> 57:10.000
In the 1950s and 60s, Kissinger, before he entered the realm of power,

57:10.080 --> 57:13.280
came up with the idea of the problem of conjecture.

57:13.360 --> 57:15.440
It's an extremely important idea

57:15.520 --> 57:17.840
that should be communicated to any decision maker,

57:17.920 --> 57:20.640
whether they're in the private sector or the public sector.

57:20.720 --> 57:23.920
And the problem of conjecture says that at any given moment

57:24.000 --> 57:29.200
when one must take a decision, there is a kind of asymmetry.

57:29.280 --> 57:33.760
And the asymmetry arises from the fact that if you act,

57:33.840 --> 57:41.680
let's say if you had acted in 1938 to prevent Hitler's takeover of Czechoslovakia,

57:41.760 --> 57:43.280
there would have been a cost.

57:43.360 --> 57:45.920
The war would have begun earlier.

57:46.000 --> 57:50.880
And even if you had successfully prevented a much larger war,

57:50.960 --> 57:53.120
the World War that broke out in 1939,

57:53.200 --> 57:55.760
you would have got no real gratitude for that.

57:55.840 --> 57:59.520
You get no payoffs for the averted catastrophe.

57:59.600 --> 58:02.080
Your preemptive action has a cost,

58:02.160 --> 58:04.640
and that you're held responsible for.

58:04.720 --> 58:07.200
The tempting thing, particularly in a democratic system,

58:07.280 --> 58:11.520
is to do nothing, hope for the best, because that has a low cost.

58:11.600 --> 58:16.000
And if disaster nevertheless happens, if you're unlucky,

58:16.080 --> 58:17.360
then you say to yourself,

58:17.440 --> 58:20.960
well, anybody in my position would have made the same error.

58:21.040 --> 58:23.600
So the cost of preemption is high,

58:23.680 --> 58:26.400
and you have to take a decision conjecturally.

58:26.480 --> 58:30.160
Because you can't know that in acting in 1938,

58:30.240 --> 58:33.040
you avert a much larger and more dangerous war.

58:33.120 --> 58:34.640
You cannot have that certainty,

58:34.720 --> 58:36.640
and there are no data that will tell you.

58:36.720 --> 58:39.280
So I think decision-making under uncertainty

58:39.360 --> 58:43.520
is the hardest thing of all, but it has to be done.

58:43.600 --> 58:46.720
And I think what I've learned from Kissinger is that

58:46.800 --> 58:51.760
you will be held responsible and judged very harshly

58:51.840 --> 58:54.240
for those actions you take.

58:54.320 --> 58:56.800
Even if they avert disaster, you won't get thanked.

58:56.880 --> 59:00.160
Nobody ever will thank Henry Kissinger for avoiding World War III.

59:02.240 --> 59:05.280
Nobody will, I think, ever thank any statesman

59:05.360 --> 59:07.040
for avoiding calamity.

59:07.120 --> 59:10.240
They will only blame them for the actions that they took.

59:10.320 --> 59:12.640
And here's the final point that Kissinger makes.

59:12.720 --> 59:16.720
Most choices in the realm of power are between evils.

59:16.800 --> 59:18.880
You just have to decide which is the greater

59:18.960 --> 59:20.320
and which is the lesser.

59:20.400 --> 59:23.120
There are very frequently no good options.

59:23.200 --> 59:25.680
I think that's very clear today in the Middle East

59:25.760 --> 59:30.880
since we're talking at a time of fresh disaster in that region.

59:30.960 --> 59:34.720
There are no good choices facing the Israeli government

59:34.800 --> 59:37.120
or even the government of the United States.

59:37.200 --> 59:39.520
But there's no option to do nothing.

59:39.600 --> 59:40.960
I think that must be clear.

59:41.840 --> 59:43.840
Let me take apart what you just said.

59:43.920 --> 59:51.920
And so the first thing you brought up is that Oppenheimer flirted with,

59:52.720 --> 59:55.680
let's call it, radical left utopianism.

59:56.400 --> 01:00:00.880
Now, that's very interesting because I would say that's true

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:04.480
of intellectuals across the West and has been since the...

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.800
What? I don't know.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.720
The last 100 years, and it's certainly something

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:14.720
that characterizes the academia at the moment.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:17.520
I mean, Larry Summers came out two days ago,

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:21.360
the former president of Harvard, savaging Harvard

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:25.520
as a consequence of its descent into this radical leftist,

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.120
statist utopian vision.

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:34.240
So there's something key to the presumption of the intellect

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:37.600
and belief in a state-imposed utopia.

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:38.960
So that's one thing.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:42.880
Then you said sequence of things that were very, very complicated.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:49.680
The first was, well, inaction also produces a combinatorial explosion.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:52.240
So we're stuck with the necessity of action.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:53.440
So that's a big problem.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:56.560
That brings up the issue again, is then under what conditions

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:57.840
is action appropriate?

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:06.000
Then you said you're also not rewarded for preventative action

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:09.360
because in part because nobody can tell what you prevented

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:10.640
if it doesn't happen, right?

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:13.600
And so there's no public virtue in that.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:17.680
And that entices the leaders of modern states

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:21.680
to forestall action because they'll be blamed for action

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:25.120
and then maybe to react precipitously once it's too late.

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:29.200
So then again, we're back to the central question here,

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:36.880
at least in part, which is how do you organize your attention

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:42.560
and sequence your action so that overreach is least likely?

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:45.440
Now, you discussed Kissinger in that regard

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:49.520
and said that he was constantly choosing between evils

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:52.400
and regarded that as a necessity of statescraft.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:55.280
You have to conduct yourself.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:00.240
We talked earlier about this idea that there's a tremendous

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:06.320
moral hazard in praying in public and signaling virtue to yourself

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:09.840
and demanding recognition for your positive actions.

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:16.480
And you said that prevention doesn't produce public claim.

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.000
That what that has to mean, at least in part,

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:22.320
is that you have to be oriented to act properly

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:27.520
despite its reputational advantage or cost, right?

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:30.880
See, that's exactly it, is that something other than reputation

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.560
has to motivate your action.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:36.800
And then the question is, what should motivate your action

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:40.800
if it's not status, power, and reputation, right?

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.560
That's exactly right. That's where that should...

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:47.040
Inoch Powell said all political careers end in failure.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:53.520
I think that any leader should reconcile himself or herself

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:58.400
to ultimate failure because doing the right thing,

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:02.000
averting disaster, will not get you rewarded.

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:04.720
And I think this is just to...

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:07.280
So then why bother? Why bother doing the right thing?

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.840
And how do you even determine what the right thing is

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:13.200
if it's not associated with public acclaim?

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.400
What would right be?

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:18.480
Because it must have ultimately been right for Churchill

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:22.720
to speak out against appeasement, as he did throughout the 1930s,

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:26.960
to take the helm in 1940 when all his predictions had been fulfilled

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:30.240
and Britain had been brought to the brink of catastrophe,

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:34.240
to lead Britain to an ultimate victory in 1945,

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:37.680
and then suffer a massive electoral defeat.

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:39.360
This is a noble story.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.320
And I think that's what any leader should aspire to,

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.040
to be right on the basis of historical judgment,

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:52.080
to accept that there will not necessarily be triumphal processions,

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:55.440
that there may, in fact, be ignominy at the end of the road,

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:58.800
but to have done the right thing, to save your nation

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:01.680
and get no thanks for it, that seems to be the most

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:03.920
that any leader can aspire to.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.200
Okay, okay, okay.

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.840
Well, I've got two comments about that,

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:11.040
and then we'll wrap this part of the interview out.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:13.200
I understand that you have a hard out.

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:18.080
You described Churchill's actions in terms of ultimate right,

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:21.840
and so you made reference to a concept of ultimate right.

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:25.040
And then you turned to a particular concept of ultimate right,

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:30.640
which was a form of extreme self-sacrifice with no public acclaim.

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:33.040
I gotta say, those are strange things for someone

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:36.800
who also said during the same discussion,

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.840
who proclaimed a kind of central atheism,

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:42.960
because I can't help seeing echoes in that of,

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.600
while the Christian passion, for example,

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:50.240
is that you're called upon to do right at your own expense,

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.320
even your own ultimate expense,

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.520
with no hope of public acclaim,

01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:00.080
and you do that in the service of something that's ultimately right.

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:06.000
And so, well, that's a parallel that occurred to me

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.040
when you made the argument.

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:08.240
That's a perfectly shrewd observation.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.080
I'm a lapsed atheist, Jordan.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.600
I go to church every Sunday,

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:15.680
precisely because having been brought up an atheist,

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:18.320
I came to realize in my career as an historian,

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:22.000
not only that atheism is a disastrous basis for a society,

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:23.920
atheist societies have probably committed

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.560
more violations of human rights than there are any others,

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.680
but also because I don't think it can be a basis

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:34.080
for individual ethical decision-making.

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.640
Church was a Christian,

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.880
and I think has to be understood as such.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:42.080
So I am a lapsed atheist and proud of it.

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:44.640
Ah, okay.

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:47.200
Well, you know, it turns out I wanted to talk to you

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.680
for the additional half an hour that I usually use,

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:52.160
but that's actually just a perfectly fine place

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.240
to bring this part of the conversation to an end.

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:57.840
I would be more than happy to talk to you again

01:05:58.400 --> 01:05:59.520
in some greater detail.

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:02.240
There's obviously many other things that we could explore.

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.840
For everyone watching and listening,

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:07.120
most of you know that I'm going to continue

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:11.120
to talk to Dr. Ferguson on the Daily Wire.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.360
I want to understand more deeply

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:16.720
where his interests in such topics

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:18.960
arose during the course of his life.

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:21.280
I usually use an autobiographical approach

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:23.120
in that half an hour.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.440
So if those of you who are watching and listening

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:27.200
would like to join us on the Daily Wire side,

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.320
that would be great.

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:30.240
Otherwise, Neil, thank you very much

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.000
for a very stimulating conversation.

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:35.200
Thank you to everyone who's paid attention

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.800
and devoted some time to walking through this podcast with us.

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:40.240
Thanks, Jordan.
