0	29920	Andrew Doyle is with me today. Andrew is a British comedian, playwright, journalist,
30000	37040	political satirist and author who co-created the fictional character Jonathan Pye and the equally
37040	43280	or perhaps even more fictional character Titania McGrath. He recently published his first book,
43280	51040	Free Speech, Why It Matters, which came out in 2021, but previously published two more
51040	58960	as the aforementioned Titania McGrath. The first of those was Woke, a guide to social justice
58960	65600	published in 2019. And the second was my first little book of intersectional activism published
65600	73360	in 2020. I haven't met Andrew before. I'm looking forward to talking with him about Free Speech and
73360	78800	about his satire and about the intersection between those two and whatever else comes up.
78800	83040	Thank you very much for coming on today. I'm looking forward to speaking with you.
83040	84160	Thanks so much for having me.
84400	89840	So, shall we start perhaps with the discussion of your book? I finished it yesterday.
91360	97920	I've become notorious, I suppose, for my particular take on Free Speech. And so,
97920	105120	it was a book that interested me. Tell me why you wrote it and what you learned and all of those
105120	110720	things. Well, it's not the sort of book I ever envisaged that I would have to write. I think
110720	115360	if you go back 10, 15 years, the idea that Free Speech, which is obviously the seedbed
115360	119680	of all our liberties, would be something that we would have to defend, would have probably
119680	123600	seemed a little bit ridiculous to me because I basically took it for granted. I thought that
123600	130000	everyone was on that side. But I fear that something has happened, particularly over the
130000	136480	past 10 years or so. And it is connected, I feel, with the rise of this social justice movement,
136480	139920	what we might call critical social justice, or however we want to call it. A lot of people call
140000	145680	it the woke movement. However you want to label that ideology, which at its heart has a real
145680	151120	mistrust of Free Speech. And you hear it all the time in the kind of phrases that the activists use,
151120	157360	phrases like words are violence or this kind of language normalizes hate or legitimizes hate or
157360	163280	all this kind of thing. And there's a real genuine mistrust of the power of language to effectively
163840	170080	corrupt the masses. And what I wanted to do, I suppose, was try and marshal a defence
170640	176560	for this principle that I had always taken for granted. But at the same time, attempt to grapple
176560	181520	with the concerns that people might have. Because my worry with the culture war, as we call it,
181520	186480	is that you have two sort of extreme polls arguing against each other. And most people
186480	191040	are caught in the middle. I think most people are broadly for the idea of Free Speech, but they
191040	197040	have a few reservations, for instance, when it comes to demagogues espousing hate or hate against
197040	201040	a particular minority group or something like that. Or people are concerned about the ways in which
201040	207280	language can cause harm. And I don't think anyone would deny that words can be hurtful. So most
207280	212880	people, I think, are somewhere in between and are open to persuasion. And I think my point,
212880	218880	my principal argument in the book, is that absolute freedom of speech is always going to be
218880	224720	better. And in fact, by promoting free speech, you're doing something to help those very people
224720	233200	that you are concerned about. So recently, the Scottish Parliament passed a hate crime law
233920	241360	that has its supporters and also its detractors. And I'd be interested in your feeling about that.
241360	245520	Now, you said, I believe in this book, if I remember the statistics correctly, that
246080	255600	there have been 120,000 incidents of police investigated speech hate crime in Britain in
255600	259120	how long? That's been over the last five years or so?
259120	267600	It's worse than that. The statistic, I quote, is between 2014 and 2019, there are 120,000 recorded
267600	272720	incidents of non-crime. They call them non-crime hate incidents. And this is something which is
272800	277600	now routine in the UK. I mean, obviously, I'm going to be talking about the UK and the US and
277600	282000	Canada is a very different kettle of fish, I'm sure. And I'm sure a lot of the people who are
282000	285840	watching won't be familiar with the problems we have in the UK. Of course, we don't have
285840	290240	constitutional protection for free speech. We don't have a First Amendment. We don't have anything
290240	295440	like that. So we are particularly vulnerable. And at the moment, unfortunately, in the UK,
295440	300880	the police who are trained by the College of Policing who do issue very specific guidelines
300880	305120	about this. And anyone can check this because if you go to the government's website on hate crime
305120	309840	and hate speech, they make very clear what they're talking about. What they say is that there are five
309840	315120	protected characteristics and these fall into race, gender, sexuality, gender identity and
315120	319840	disability. I think I might misquote that, but there's one missing. But anyway, there are five
319840	326000	protected characteristics. And if a victim, and they do use the word victim rather than complainant,
326000	333440	if a victim perceives that any speech or crime was motivated by hatred towards any of those
333440	338960	five protected characteristics, then it qualifies as a hate crime if it's criminal. If it's not
338960	343920	criminal, if it's just speech or something like that, it qualifies as a non-crime hate incident.
343920	348960	Police will investigate that. They will record that. And although non-crime incidents don't
348960	354000	lead to prosecution, they do go on a criminal reference check that many people take. We call it
354160	358320	disclosure and barring service here. So it can affect your employment prospects.
359120	362720	And is that without a trial? That's recorded without a trial?
362720	366480	Of course. So you get a quasi-criminal record.
366480	369680	You get something flagged up, particularly if you're applying for a teaching job,
369680	372160	say something like that where you're working with children, it's very important. And you get
372160	377360	this thing flagged up. So it does have serious ramifications. But even beyond that, we have
377360	382560	hate speech laws which are encoded into the Public Order Act, which is one example. But the
382880	388720	main example is the Electronic Communications Act 2003. In this country, and I do quote the
388720	397520	statistic in the book as well, we have roughly 3,000 people arrested a year for offensive things
397520	402720	that they have said online. So in other words, nine people a day, roughly, the police in the UK
402720	407200	are arresting. And people in the UK will be familiar with this, because if you see the Twitter
407200	410960	accounts of various police forces, various police departments across the country, they often put
410960	414800	things out like, you know, make sure you don't say anything offensive or thoughtless online,
414800	420400	or we will be knocking on your door. They say these very kind of frightening things. There was a
420400	427200	recent police display outside a supermarket in the UK. It went viral, this image. It was them
427200	433360	next to a big digital billboard. And the slogan on the billboard was being offensive is an offense.
433360	437520	And this was flanked by police officers who were socially distanced, but they were there and their
437520	442880	masks, which made it seem slightly more sinister. They got in a lot of trouble for that, because
442880	447520	people were saying, well, being offensive surely isn't a crime. But actually, the problem with
447520	451360	that is that the police clearly thought it was a crime. And they, you know, they were acting on
451360	455600	that basis. They'd obviously hadn't just concocted this billboard out of nothing, they'd really
455600	461040	considered what it should say. And more to the point, actually, they were right. In this country,
461040	467520	you can go to prison for jokes, for offensive remarks. And people have gone to prison,
467520	473680	have been arrested routinely for causing offense. And of course, the notion of offense
473680	479120	is incredibly subjective. In fact, in fact, the legal stipulation in the communications act
479120	483120	is that you will have broken the law if the judge and jury deem that you have
483760	488560	communicated material that is quote unquote, grossly offensive. Well, I don't know how you
488560	493280	define that. I wouldn't know. And also, who defines it is the real question, as far as I'm
493280	498880	concerned. I mean, I've looked into this legislation to some degree. And one of the things that struck
498880	506560	me about it was that it seems to be purposefully left up to the hypothetical victim to define
507200	514560	offense, which has become a subjective reality. And you can understand why that might be to some
514560	520880	degree, because how would you define hate? And how would you define offense without, especially
520880	525840	the latter, without making recourse to someone's subjective experience? But then, of course,
526560	531760	well, we'll delve into that in a moment. I should start with the hard question, I suppose, which is,
532720	538240	well, clearly, people can say hateful things. And those things can be damaging psychologically and
538960	543280	physiologically, I suppose, if people are stressed enough. And the borderline is very
543280	551200	difficult to identify. Why is it that people shouldn't just assume that you're a mean loudmouth and
551200	554800	that they shouldn't pay any attention to you at all, because you're concerned about this?
555440	563040	I mean, which is that's the general criticism of critics of hate speech, let's say. And so,
563040	568160	why in the world aren't we aren't the people who are putting this forward just trying to make the
568160	573840	world a nicer place? What's the big problem here? Well, I think a lot of people do assume that I'm a
573840	580560	mean loudmouth. I think they assume that about most people who defend freedom of speech. And I'm sure
580560	584960	the latter part of your question is absolutely right. Insofar as I imagine a lot of the people
584960	589120	who are skeptical about free speech are, in fact, trying to make the world a better place. I don't
589120	594960	think that's mutually exclusive. I mean, the problem here is that the legislation as it currently
594960	600160	stands here means that, for instance, if you say something critical about me, and I perceive
600160	605360	that it was motivated by hatred towards me on the basis of my sexuality, for instance, I could phone
605360	610160	the police and that would be recorded and would appear on hate crime statistics in this in this
610160	614720	country, because it's all about perception. That word is used about five or six times within the
614720	618960	one passage in the in the hate crime legislation, the word perception of the victim. And again,
618960	623680	I say victim, not complainant, which suggests a complete disregard for due process. But I suppose
623680	628640	we can leave that aside. But the most common, the most common and the most frightening misconception
628640	633840	I have found when it comes to people defending free speech is that they are doing so because they
633840	640000	want to have the right to say appalling things about people with no comeback whatsoever. And
640000	644880	they want to go back to some imaginary good old days, you know, where you could just be casually
644880	649760	homophobic and racist and sexist and all the rest of it. And no one would call you out for that.
649760	653200	Now, I don't know anyone who falls into that category. And most people who are,
654160	658720	you know, advocating for free speech are doing so precisely because they are aware
658720	663520	that in countries where free speech protections are meager, minorities tend to suffer the most.
663520	669440	And in fact, there is a it seems to be a corollary to me that those who are genuinely
669440	674240	for free speech are also for equal rights and protecting the vulnerable in society. And this
674240	678080	perception, which I really find unpleasant, this perception that if you are standing up for this
679040	683120	most foundational of principles of freedom of speech, if you're standing up for that,
683120	687600	you can only be doing so if you have a nefarious motive. I mean, what a horribly pessimistic
687600	694160	view of humanity. And it seems to be... Well, it seems to be a direct derivation of the hypothesis,
694160	706960	for example, that all Western social organizations, particularly Western, are based on power and
707040	713680	are best conceived of as tyrannical. And so if that's your view, why would you not assume that
713680	719360	most use of speech is essentially an exercise of power in the service of tyranny?
720080	724000	But then why would you assume that the government in control of any particular
724560	729840	country isn't part of that tyranny that you're describing? It seems odd to me to be
730880	735760	mindful of the potential for tyranny, but then to outsource all your individual liberties to the
735760	739920	state. It seems contradictory to me. Well, I guess the way that that is
741680	748320	elided over is by allowing the hypothetical individual victim to define the offense.
749120	753760	This is the problem, though. I mean, the problem I've run into, and this is partly why I appreciated
753760	761120	your book, is that increasingly, people are called upon to defend fundamental assumptions
761120	769120	that were so taken for granted that virtually no one has an argument that's fully articulated at hand.
770400	775280	When no one questions free speech, no one has to defend it thoroughly. As soon as it's questioned,
775280	782400	well, it becomes an extraordinarily complicated problem. The same with gender identity. When
782400	785840	no one's paying attention to it, it's obvious, but as soon as you have to think it through,
785840	793040	it becomes a rat's nest to say the least. When I was in the UK a few years ago, I saw a number
793040	800960	of things that I felt were disturbing. People seem to have accepted the omnipresence of CCTV
800960	808080	cameras to a degree that I found horrifying. Frankly, I don't like CCTV cameras. I don't like
809120	815200	the message they portray, which is that everyone is criminal enough so they should be
815200	821680	surveyed all the time and someone needs to be watching. I noticed, too, in London in particular,
821680	829840	that many buildings had instituted airport-level security so that you had to pass through a
829840	834080	metal detector and have your bags checked, et cetera, while you were moving in and out of
834080	840880	buildings. It struck me as quite horrifying given that, as far as I'm concerned, Great Britain and
840960	848320	its legal and parliamentary traditions are at the epicenter of Western freedoms. I mean,
848320	852880	you could make a case for France, I suppose, but not a strong one, as far as I'm concerned.
854880	862000	Your citizens seem to have accepted this with virtually no problem. Now, on the heels of that,
862000	869840	we have this multiplication of hate crime. That's as much a surprise to me as it is to you.
870400	874800	You won't have seen all of the CCTV cameras believe. Apparently, they're absolutely everywhere. You
874800	881280	can't walk anywhere in the UK without being potentially monitored. I'm not saying someone's
881280	886480	watching you all the time, but things are being recorded and digitized. It's interesting to me,
886480	891040	because I remember back in the early 2000s, when the government was trying to push through its ID
891040	896640	card scheme and, broadly speaking, the left were unanimously against it. They didn't like this idea
896640	900960	of living in a society where there's someone on the corner saying, papers, please. No one really
900960	907120	wanted that. But we've become very docile and very accepting of the idea that we need to be
907120	910560	coddled and monitored by the state. I mean, I know there's a recent debate about vaccine
910560	916880	passports, and people seem very blasé about this idea that we might have to have our ID
916880	921520	embedded and encoded onto a card to get anywhere or to do anything. I think there's
921520	925280	something going on there and it is connected with what you've brought up in terms of hate
925280	929840	crime legislation. We've just become accustomed. I mean, you mentioned specifically the problem in
929840	935360	Scotland. And seriously, it relates very closely to what you're saying, because the SMP, who are the
935360	941040	only really party with any clout in Scotland, that's the Scottish National Party. And it's never a
941040	944240	good idea, is it, when you have one political party, which doesn't really have an opposition.
944960	950160	They have a reputation for quite nanny, statious policies. They introduced a,
950160	954160	what was it called, the named person scheme. It didn't go through in the end, but they wanted to
954160	959280	assign every child born in Scotland with a state guardian. They effectively didn't trust
959840	964480	the parents to raise their own kids. They have other examples, minimum pricing on alcohol or
964480	969280	ban on two-for-one pizzas, because they don't trust poor people not to gain weight. So all
969280	974320	sorts of these sorts of policies. But in this current hate crime bill, which has just sailed
974320	979120	through because there's no opposition, Humza Youssef, the justice secretary, has pushed through,
979120	983920	he specifically included an element to this bill, which says that they can criminalize you for things
983920	990160	you say in the privacy of your own home. I mean, that's just a given. I would have never thought
990160	995120	that anyone in this country would not consider that to be an incredible invasion on individual
995120	1002400	liberty. You can make a strong case for Scotland as the ground zero for many of the, developing
1002400	1008400	many of the concepts that undergird the entire Western notion of freedom. And to see that emerging
1008480	1013120	in Scotland is absolutely stunningly terrifying, as far as I'm concerned.
1013120	1018480	Think of Mill Gibson with a face covered in woad shouting freedom as he's executed in that
1018480	1022560	in Braveheart. You do think of Scotland as being associated with it, but honestly,
1022560	1025520	Scotland for some reason, and I don't know what it is, and it might be to do that it's
1025520	1030480	effectively this one party state, it seems to have this incredible sense. And they've really
1030480	1036240	brought into this idea that unless they can police the thought and speech of their citizens,
1036240	1040560	then they will just run a run a mock. It's there's another element to that bill. I don't
1040560	1044000	know if you know about this. There's a specific element on the bill, which talks about the public
1044000	1050080	performance of a play. So they've effectively said that they will criminalize public performances.
1050080	1055200	So say if it can be deemed that those performances were designed to stir up hatred, that's the
1055200	1060080	formulation stir up hatred. I'm not quite sure what that means necessarily. But the when when
1060080	1064800	Humza Yousef was questioned about this in parliament, he actually said, well, theoretically a neo Nazi
1064800	1069440	or someone from the far right could get together with a group of actors and put on a play to to
1069440	1074400	recruit people to his cause. And as I said at the time, you know, I don't know any neo Nazis,
1074400	1078240	but they're not into amateur dramatics. That's not their thing. They don't do that. They wouldn't
1078240	1082240	get involved. And yet he's got this idea in his head that that is a feasible. I mean, it seems
1082240	1086320	ridiculous. But it's not really because the ramifications are quite a quite serious. And
1087200	1091520	the way it's just gone through without any opposition really, really troubles me. I mean,
1091520	1096160	there have been modifications, I should say, in fairness. In the initial bill in the initial
1096160	1100960	draft of the bill, they had said that you could be criminalized irrespective of intention. In
1100960	1106160	other words, yes, if that was terrifying, awful. And you know, if you wrote a play that then
1106800	1110160	stimulated someone to join the far right, then you were still responsible whether you intended
1110160	1113760	it or not. Now the problem is, you know, with theatrical representation or any kind of artistic
1113760	1117840	representation is sometimes you want to represent the worst aspects of humanity.
1118560	1122640	Because that's part of drama and literature and all the rest of it. I mean, you would be,
1123200	1126080	there would be no artistic freedom if that went through. So fortunately,
1126720	1132800	that element of the bill was modified. Well, and also the attempt to reverse the idea that intent
1132800	1139760	is important is that's even that's even more catastrophic. It's always been a miracle to me
1139760	1147120	that our legal system ever became psychologically sophisticated enough so that intent rather than
1147120	1153440	outcome was what mattered. Because you have to be a sophisticated thinker to see that someone has
1153440	1160640	done damage to someone else. But and so the damage is real and market and troublesome and costly,
1160640	1168000	all of that painful. But because the intent wasn't there, the severity of the action is
1168000	1172640	dramatically mitigated. That's a sign of maturity and sophistication to note that. And the fact
1172720	1178000	that it's built into the legal system is nothing short of remarkable. And then to remove that and to
1178960	1186000	make the felt consequences, the arbiter of the reality of the situation is
1186000	1190320	a dreadful assault on the integrity of the law as such, as far as I can tell.
1190880	1195280	Well, moreover, it's something that everyone intuitively understands. We all understand
1195280	1199360	the difference between murder and manslaughter. You know, we all understand that intent actually
1199360	1206240	does, like you say, escalate the severity of a crime. And it's bigger than that, isn't it?
1206880	1210480	Because this idea that intention doesn't matter is actually built into
1211120	1215520	so much of this what we call social justice discourse. If you think of critical race theory,
1216080	1220400	it's just a given that there are racist structures and you can be racist without
1220400	1224800	intending to be racist. And I really do dispute that, because I think in order to be racist,
1224880	1230160	intention has to be at the heart of that. Otherwise, it's incoherent to me. But this is really
1231520	1237440	a degraded view of humanity, I feel, where we are effectively like marionettes,
1238480	1244000	and that we're just being played, and that we don't have any agency anymore. And therefore,
1244960	1249680	we can't be responsible for our own words, not just our actions. We can't be responsible for our
1249680	1254400	own words and the ramifications. So we have to be controlled and we have to be stifled by the
1254400	1263840	state. And it makes me very nervous. So I've been thinking through the importance of free speech,
1263840	1269920	I suppose, from a psychological perspective. And it seems to me that, well, we can walk
1269920	1275360	through some axioms and you can tell me what you think about them, if you would. So I mean,
1275360	1281760	the first thing we might posit is that it's useful to think. It's better to think than not to think.
1282000	1287440	That might seem self-evident, but thought can be troublesome and stir up trouble,
1287440	1296160	and your thoughts can be inaccurate. So it's perhaps not that unreasonable to start the questioning
1296160	1305200	there. But I think it was Alfred North-Whitehead who said that thinking allows our thoughts to die
1305760	1313760	instead of us. And so he was thinking about the evolution of thought in some sense from a biological
1313760	1319600	perspective. So imagine a creature that's incapable of thought has to act something out,
1320480	1325520	a representation of the world or an intent. It has to be embodied. And then if that fails,
1326320	1332160	well, it fails in action. And so the consequence of that might be death. It might be very severe.
1332880	1339840	Whereas once you can think, you can represent the world abstractly, you can divorce the
1339840	1346480	abstraction from the world, and then you can produce avatars of yourself, sometimes in the
1346480	1351840	image like in dreams, let's say, or in literature and fiction and movies and so on, produce avatars
1351840	1359360	of ourselves that are fictional, and then run them as simulations in the abstract world and
1359360	1366880	observe the consequences. And we do that in our stories. We do that when we dream. We do that when
1366880	1374400	we imagine in images and depict a dramatic scenario playing itself out. But then we also do that in
1374400	1380000	words because we encode those images. It's one more level of abstraction. We encode those images
1380000	1386640	into words, and those words become partial dramatic avatars, and then the words can battle
1386640	1392880	with one another. So thought seems to work, let's say verbal thought. You ask yourself a question.
1394000	1399760	You receive an answer in some mysterious manner. There's an internal revelation of sorts. That's
1399760	1405120	the spontaneous thought. When you sit down to write a book, thoughts come to you, perhaps because
1405120	1410240	you pose yourself a question. And no one knows how that works, but we experience it, that thoughts
1410240	1415040	manifest themselves in the theater of our imagination. So that's the revelatory aspect. And then
1415040	1420560	there's the critical aspect, which is, well, now you've thought this and perhaps you've written it
1420560	1427120	down. Can you generate counter positions? Are there universes that you can imagine where this
1427120	1432800	doesn't apply? Are there situations where it doesn't apply? Are there better ways of formulating that
1432800	1439680	thought? But I would say with regard to critical thought, and to some degree with regard to productive
1439680	1449440	thought, an indeterminate proportion of that is dependent on speech. I don't think it's unreasonable
1449440	1456080	to point out that thought is internalized speech, and that the dialectical process that constitutes
1456080	1461840	critical thinking is internalized speech. So you and I are engaging in a dialectic enterprise.
1461840	1468160	You'll pause at something and I'll respond to it and you'll respond to that. And we're in a kind
1468160	1474480	of combat. There's some cooperation about it as well. And we're attempting to formulate a truth
1474480	1480000	more clearly, at least in principle, if we're being honest. We do that when we're speaking.
1480000	1484560	So our thought, the quality of our thought is actually dependent on our ability to speak
1484560	1490160	our minds. Absolutely. And then, so go ahead. Well, I couldn't agree more because I think
1490720	1495920	speech is the way in which we collaborate on our thoughts. That's how it works. You
1495920	1499920	refine those thought processes that you've described. I mean, I'm no psychologist, but I
1499920	1505680	understand this basic premise that we have these various thoughts that are continually in conflict
1505680	1510640	within ourselves, unless we're able to articulate them and to engage in others through that process,
1510640	1514720	through that transactional process of speech, then those thoughts are never refined and they
1514720	1520080	remain in this kind of infancy. And this is why- Yes, well, they're as refined as we can make them
1520080	1525040	as individuals. But that's also assuming that you even have the words, which you also learned
1525040	1530400	in the dialectical process. Right, exactly. It's not as though the truth is ever fully graspable,
1530400	1534240	but we can get nearer to it through that collaborative process of speaking and
1534240	1538320	articulating the thoughts. And in fact, even in the act of, like you say, writing or articulating
1538320	1543360	yourself, with your self-authoring program, for instance, the act of writing things out
1543920	1550080	is what clarifies the points of view for you. I've actually found that the way that I think
1550080	1554640	about these issues now is largely a product of the fact that I've written so much about it.
1555040	1560640	And changed my mind through the act of learning how to express myself on these points. And the
1560640	1567520	consequence of not having that opportunity, I think, is something I would barely want to
1567520	1574640	contemplate. And I think to give an example of the moment, which is that because any kind of
1574640	1579600	attempt to have a discussion or debate about the perceived conflict between trans rights and gender
1579600	1584560	critical feminism, because to even attempt that discussion at the moment will have such
1584560	1590640	grave social consequences. And certainly in terms of career prospects, major consequences,
1590640	1595600	people will not have that discussion. I have people I know in politics, in the media, and they
1595600	1601200	say to me quite honestly, I will not talk about this. I have concerns, I have qualms, I want answers
1601200	1605520	to questions, but I absolutely will not open my mouth about this. And if you don't do that,
1606240	1611120	that this is why no one understands the issue. This is why no one has reached any kind of consensus
1611120	1616960	on this issue. All we have is a sense in which to have the quote unquote wrong opinion makes you a
1616960	1621520	pariah. And therefore I better not have that opinion. Well, then that's not a sincerely held
1621520	1627520	conviction. That's just that's just if the definition of wrong is continually transforming
1627520	1632240	and in an unpredictable manner, then it's best just to sidestep the issue entirely. And then
1632320	1637440	that leaves it murky and ill defined and assuming that you believe that thought has any utility.
1637440	1640400	And so when you're sitting down to write, when I'm sitting down to write,
1641120	1645760	and I produce a sentence, you know, it might have come from some theoretical perspective,
1645760	1650640	maybe I'm approaching something from a Freudian perspective or a Marxist perspective or a
1652480	1659040	enlightenment perspective, etc. I mean, it's a psychological trope, I suppose, that
1659840	1664880	we all think the thoughts of dead philosophers, right? We think we have our own opinions, but
1664880	1670160	that's really very, very, very, very rarely the case. It's not that easy to come up with something
1670160	1676800	truly original and generally make incremental progress at best. And so your ability to abstractly
1676800	1682880	represent the world and then to generate avatars that can be defeated without you dying is dependent
1682880	1688640	on your incorporation of a multitude of opinions. And that in itself is a consequence of
1689760	1694560	I mean, that works to the degree that communication is actually free and that you can get access to
1694560	1700080	as much thought as you can possibly manage. So I can't see how you can deny the centrality
1700880	1705360	of free speech as a fundamental right or the fundamental right, perhaps,
1706160	1712800	unless you simultaneously deny the utility of thought. But maybe if you are also inclined to
1713520	1721440	remove the individual from the central position of the political discourse, then maybe you can also
1723680	1729200	make the case at least implicitly that individual thought doesn't matter and that mostly it's just
1729200	1734400	causing trouble. But I think individual thought is key. And actually, even in the outline you've
1734400	1740160	described there, there is individual agency in reaching a conclusion that has been articulated
1740160	1744240	before insofar as if you are engaged with a multitude of writers and philosophers and
1744240	1748400	artists and ideas and you've come out with a perspective. Well, that perspective may not
1748400	1753040	be original to you, but the process that you've gone through to reach that viewpoint is individual
1753040	1757280	to you. There is a power in that. There's something important about that.
1757280	1762880	No, there's something crucial. If you're a practicing psychotherapist, one of the things
1762880	1770880	you have to learn is to not provide people with your words too much. What you want is for them
1770880	1776800	to formulate the conclusion. And you can guide them through the process of investigation. You
1776800	1784880	talked about the self-authoring process, which is online at selfauthoring.com, that it steps people
1784880	1790560	say through the process of writing an autobiography, of analyzing their current virtues and faults and
1791280	1798320	making a future plan. The utility of all of that is dependent on the person who's
1799920	1808240	undertaking the exercise, generating their own verbal representations. And that seems to cement
1808240	1815840	it somehow as yours if you've come up with the words. And so it's the uppermost expression of
1815840	1823200	personhood, the ability to have the words that you should speak reveal themselves to you and to
1823200	1829200	have the right to express them as you see fit. Yes. In which case, if you are merely repeating
1829200	1834640	an accepted script, then to what extent can you even say to be an individual at all?
1836960	1843760	I think that's part of the philosophical conundrum is that if you believe that all people do is repeat
1843760	1850960	predigested scripts, especially if your view is that the fundamental human motivation is power
1850960	1855920	and the entire social landscape is nothing but a competition between equally,
1857120	1863840	what would you say, selfish and single-minded power strivers, then there is no individual.
1864480	1869920	There's no individual in that conceptual world. And it seems to me that that's the world that
1870160	1880400	we're being pushed to inhabit and are criticized for on moral grounds for criticizing. And I'm
1880400	1886960	still trying to get my hands around this. I mean, when I went to Britain, I saw the CTTV cameras
1886960	1893040	and the increased security, and it isn't clear to me how that's related to the social justice issues
1893040	1898320	that so-called social justice issues that we're discussing. But they seem to me in some very
1898320	1902800	difficult to comprehend way, part and parcel of the same thing, the same dangerous thing.
1903600	1907360	Well, I think it's probably connected just in terms of this distrust of humanity or this
1907360	1914960	belief that people need to be shepherded, otherwise left to their own devices, chaos will reign.
1914960	1920640	I think that's the connection. It's not directly connected as far as the issues relating to liberty
1920640	1925360	and CTTV, obviously predate what we now call whatever the current social justice movement
1925360	1932560	is called. But I think there is something there. I mean, the censorship, the impulse
1932560	1938000	to censor what people read, and this is something that particularly hits home to me in the arts,
1938880	1947280	is based on this view that ultimately the people are or the populace is liable to corruption
1947280	1952320	if they're exposed to the wrong materials. And what's very interesting to me about that,
1952320	1957120	I mean, you've written a lot about the way in which literature, for instance, informs our
1957120	1962560	experiences because it is, in a sense, like when you read philosophers, you're feeling your way
1962560	1967200	through other lives and other experiences that are trans-historical and cross-cultural,
1967200	1972400	and they inform the way that you react in your own individual experience. But if you start to say,
1972400	1978720	as an artist, no, you can only represent for a start what you personally are or have experienced,
1978800	1982640	and you cannot represent anything which is morally problematic to use the phrase that they
1982640	1989200	absolutely adore, then art fails to, and literature in particular, fails to function in the way that
1989200	1995040	it should because you can't explore those things. This is why I often, when it comes to censorship
1995040	1999520	of the arts, I often go back to what Oscar Wilde said about this. He said, there's no such thing
1999520	2005600	as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written or badly written. That is all. And that
2005600	2012480	actually art and morality sometimes are not, in other words, art shouldn't just be about promoting
2012480	2016560	whatever the ethical trend is of any given time. It's much bigger than that.
2016560	2022560	Well, it's not art at that point at all. As far as I'm concerned, if you can state the purpose
2022560	2030960	of the art in explicit terms, especially if it's in accordance with, let's say, an ideology that's
2031040	2035520	shared by a multitude of people, it's not art at all. It's propaganda.
2035520	2039360	It's totally banal. I mean, this is why so many people are getting sick of Hollywood,
2039360	2042640	I mean, to bring it down to a different level, that people are sick of the entertainment on their
2042640	2047360	TV, on their streaming services, and on Hollywood, because they have this constant feeling that they're
2047360	2052880	being hectic by some moralistic person in a studio saying, you know, our focus here is on
2052880	2059120	diversity, our focus here is on the right moral message, that the message of the story is one
2059120	2063520	that would be approved by a group of intersectional activists, and you get this all the time seeping
2063520	2067520	into mainstream entertainment, and people get really, really sick of it. It's not that when
2067520	2073280	you see a lesbian kiss in Star Wars, that that offends you because you're a homophobe, most
2073280	2077520	sci-fi fans, they've never had a problem with diversity or anything like that. What bothers
2077520	2082800	them about it is this sense of someone saying to them, we think you're all evil bigots and you
2082800	2087360	need to be educated, and that's why we're going to shoehorn in a lesbian kiss into the end of this
2087360	2091520	film. That's why people have a problem. I mean, you had it yourself recently with that ludicrous
2091520	2097200	Marvel comics thing, where you became the Red Skull, and that to me was a perfect example of the
2097200	2105200	banality of an artistic endeavor that becomes an exercise in political pedagogy, because that
2105200	2111280	was quite clearly, I mean, you couldn't even say it was satirical, because it cannot be satirically
2111280	2115600	effective if the thing that they are comparing you to is the precise opposite of the thing you
2115600	2121520	believe. I mean, of all the sort of public figures I can think of, you have the most clear track
2121520	2126080	record of opposing tyranny in all its forms, which anyone who knows anything about your work will
2126080	2131440	know. You've spent years lecturing about the evils of authoritarianism, including Nazism. So the idea
2131440	2140640	that you would then become this super magic Nazi is propagandistic. It's totally banal artistically.
2140640	2145920	Firstly, you can't, it's not satirically, right? But also it's just, it's just, it's just,
2147040	2150000	do you know what it reminds me of? Actually, I don't know if you, if you remember after the Fatwa
2150000	2156000	against Salman Rushdie, there was a film made in Pakistan called International Gorillaz,
2156000	2162880	where they turned Salman Rushdie into this evil villain playboy who was colluding with the
2162880	2168560	Israeli military services. And at the end of the film, these flying copies of the Quran float down
2168560	2172560	and shoot laser beams into his head and kill him off. But it, and that is such a ridiculous,
2172560	2177280	laughable film, you know, you put your enemy as the main villain, and you just misrepresent him
2177280	2180720	in that way. Well, that's just what they did to you. It's as banal as that. And that's, I think
2180720	2187120	people are sick of that. Well, the response thankfully seems to indicate that, you know, it
2187120	2192800	didn't, did people, it didn't do me any harm as far as I can tell. I mean, it was very
2193440	2199440	shocking to me that it happened. It took me about 12 hours to sort of regain my composure,
2199440	2205120	because I actually couldn't believe it to begin with. I was sure that it was a fabrication,
2205920	2211760	especially, but then it was even more shocking when I found out who had authored it. You know,
2211760	2215760	it wasn't, it was someone who had an intellectual reputation. And so.
2216960	2220320	But he's an activist, isn't he? He's a, he's an intersectional activist.
2220400	2223520	He definitely, his opinions definitely place him on the radical,
2224080	2231360	on the side of the radical left. So it's very difficult to, so there's an attack on
2233200	2240240	the essence of free speech. I mean, I remember reading Derrida. Derrida criticized our culture,
2240240	2246240	Western culture as phallogocentric. Yeah. And it's really actually quite a precise word.
2246800	2252240	So the phallic part of it is masculine, obviously related to the phallus to the,
2252960	2259280	and logos is, well, that's the central concept of Greek rationalism,
2259280	2263840	but it's also the central concept of Christianity. And the logos is
2265280	2271840	something like the magical power of genuine and true speech. It's something like that. And
2272640	2279680	there are representations of the magical power of speech that predate Greece and Christianity.
2279680	2286960	You see it in Mesopotamia that this, the equivalent to the savior and ancient Mesopotamian
2288080	2293760	religious thinking was Marduk and he could speak magic words. He had eyes all the way around his
2293760	2298560	head, which meant that he paid attention to everything, but he could speak magic words. And
2299440	2309840	and so that idea of the centrality of speech to the, and its association with the very fabric of
2309840	2316640	reality, that's been an idea that has strived to make itself manifest for thousands and thousands
2316640	2324480	of years. I mean, in the Judeo-Christian tradition, in the biblical tradition, the word is given
2324480	2331760	cosmological status as the thing that brings habitable order out of chaos and it's identified
2331760	2338880	with divinity itself. And so the assault on free speech is an assault on a principle that's
2339840	2345120	fundamental beyond, say, its centrality, its central importance to the enlightenment.
2345760	2350800	And it's an assault on the, on the idea of the logos itself.
2351600	2356480	I agree. This is why I always mistrusted the, the post-structuralist. So when I was studying
2356480	2360880	for English, it was the Derrida and Foucault and Lyotard and these were taken as a given and this
2360880	2364960	idea that there's no, there is no truth beyond language, you know, language is all language,
2364960	2368400	the way in which we construct our perception of reality and our perception of truth. And
2368400	2371680	and that actually there is no truth at the heart of it. I just found it so depressing,
2372240	2376400	depressingly pessimistic because it also means that you construct, can construct any kind of
2376400	2381600	reality you like and it, and it also. Well, maybe that's part of the motivation for it is
2383200	2390720	the, the hypothetical lack of constraint by anything that that seems to imply, right? I mean,
2391280	2397760	if there's no canonical reality, while there's no responsibility, that's for sure. You could
2397760	2401760	argue that there's no meaning and it's deeply pessimistic, but maybe the payoff for that is no
2401760	2406000	responsibility, but there's also no constraint of any sort. There's certainly no ethical constraint
2406960	2414160	and I mean, I keep trying to dig to see what's at the bottom of this, this anti-logo sentiment and
2415600	2421520	it's a very, it's a very difficult thing to make to get right. Maybe it's not even as deliberate as
2421520	2427680	the way that it sounds. Maybe it is just the fact that that these theories for whatever reason became
2427680	2431760	fashionable in universities about 20 years ago and now for whatever reason they have
2431920	2436800	escaped into the mainstream and, and you know, I mean, most of the people that push this stuff
2437360	2442960	don't read Foucault and they don't know about the people whose ideas they've, they've imbibed and
2442960	2446880	actually very much misunderstood. You know, I mean, the whole point of the postmodernist was to,
2446880	2452560	to, to, to trash the notion of grand narratives and what we have now in the social justice movement
2452560	2456480	is an incredible grand narrative. You know, we are, we are on the right side of history. We are the
2456480	2462000	righteous ones and everyone else needs to be, you know, decimated and it's, it's, it seems to me
2463200	2467200	that this stuff, I don't think it's as conspiratorial as that. I think it's just sort of
2468000	2472000	circumstances of history, one thing after another and this is where we're at now,
2472000	2476400	but the end result that we have to deal with, which I think you've alluded to is this idea
2476400	2481440	that if there is no such thing as reality beyond language, then you are at liberty to, to construct
2481440	2489280	whatever a pseudo reality that you desire or is easiest for you. And we see elements of this
2489280	2493520	reverberating, I think in a lot of the discourse at the moment of things like lived experience,
2493520	2498400	you know, you can present as much data as you want, but it will be disregarded if it doesn't
2498400	2503120	tally with what lived experience really means, which is what I want to be true. Well, there's
2503120	2509280	also this insistence that seems part of it that, I mean, I objected to some legislation that was
2509280	2515280	passed in Canada and that's sort of what propelled me into public visibility, let's say.
2516080	2523200	And to begin with, I was mostly concentrating on the violation of the principle of free speech
2523200	2529520	that the legislation seemed to me to represent because it compelled certain utterances and
2529520	2535760	I was never a fan of hate speech laws to begin with. And, and this was something beyond hate
2535760	2541600	speech laws because hate speech laws stop you from saying things, whereas compelled speech laws
2541600	2546480	force you to say something which is much worse, even though the first one is also
2547040	2553760	inadvised, ill-advised as far as I'm concerned. But I've realized more recently that I was also
2553760	2560560	disturbed, although in a less explicit manner, with the theory of identity that was an implicit
2560640	2567360	part of the legislation. So with gender identity, for example, and we're engaged in a discussion
2567360	2572720	across our culture about gender identity, I mean, I know as a personality psychologist that
2574880	2580080	there are females, biological females who have masculine personalities and there are
2580080	2585680	biological males who have feminine personalities, that the link between personality as such and,
2586640	2594320	biological structure is suggestive, but not absolute. And there's a lot of variability.
2596080	2603120	But the idea that identity is something that you define yourself and that you can change
2604320	2612720	at will at any point seems to me to be entirely counterproductive and dangerous because it's
2612720	2620880	inaccurate. So your identity isn't merely your membership in whatever group you happen to identify
2620880	2626000	with at that moment. It's certainly not merely your sexuality or merely your race. In fact,
2626640	2631440	your identity is barely your race because your identity is something more like
2632640	2640000	how you conduct yourself in the world. And if you define yourself as black, let's say,
2640720	2648000	that doesn't give you much of a map to encountering and approaching the world. It's nowhere near
2648000	2657680	detailed enough. And then the idea that you define it, I've been thinking about that a lot,
2659200	2665520	you never define your identity by yourself. You can't because you're surrounded by other people
2665520	2671600	and they have to play along with you. And if they don't play along with you voluntarily,
2671600	2677440	which means they appreciate the quality of your game and they understand it, then you're either
2677440	2683200	going to be alienated or you have to impose your identity by force. But that's also not a very good
2683200	2689040	solution. I mean, I just spent some time interviewing one of the world's foremost authorities on
2689040	2694640	aggression and that'll be released in a bit. Perhaps it's been released before this will be
2694640	2702960	released. He's done longitudinal studies of aggression. And if the idea that our social
2702960	2710240	structures are predicated on power was true, then children would start out not being aggressive and
2710240	2714400	they would become more aggressive with time. And the more aggressive children would be more
2714400	2721600	successful. And none of that is true. Children start out more aggressive than they are on average
2721600	2727200	by the time their adults. Aggression levels decrease with age rather than increasing. And
2727200	2734160	there's no evidence whatsoever that it's a useful long term strategy in the social world.
2734960	2741280	Identity is something you negotiate the way you negotiate a game. It has to be that way.
2742560	2746160	There's something rather sinister, isn't there, about the way in which present day identity
2746160	2753840	politics is about imposition onto others, rather than an assertion of who I am or whatever that
2753840	2760000	might be. I mean, I always mistrusted it. And so I can see the utility of identity politics,
2760000	2764880	politically speaking, in scenarios where people are marginalized. You know, I understand why gay
2764880	2769920	people collectively came together back in the 60s to fight for their rights, because there was
2769920	2773840	obviously a serious problem or the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland in the 60s and 70s
2773840	2778160	and that kind of thing, where Catholics weren't able to have the vote or to get housing. So that
2778160	2783760	sort of makes sense to me. The current identity politics are what we might call identitarians.
2783760	2789680	A lot of it strikes me as about power. In fact, I feel like they would be an incredible subject
2789680	2795120	for Foucault if he were alive today, because I've noticed this correlation and a lot of people have
2795120	2799520	noticed this correlation. And I never get an answer about this. But why is it whenever online,
2799600	2803440	whenever I'm viciously attacked or threatened, something particularly pernicious,
2804240	2811280	the person doing it always has their pronouns in their bio or a rainbow gay flag in their bio.
2811280	2815600	Why is there a correlation that I've experienced again and again? I mean, it's almost inevitable
2815600	2824080	at this point, between the need to self identify in terms of sexuality and gender, and a kind of
2824160	2828000	cruelty or viciousness or a need to attack an aggression.
2828000	2835600	Well, one of the things that disturbs me constantly about ideological representations of
2836800	2843200	the world, broadly speaking, is that their fundamental danger is that they always contain
2843200	2851200	a too convenient theory of evil and malevolence. And for me, any theory that locates the fundamental
2851200	2858480	problem of evil somewhere other than inside you is dangerous. Now, that isn't to say that
2859520	2865760	social structures can't be corrupted and aren't corrupt. That's an existential problem in and
2865760	2870720	of itself. It's always the case that our social institutions aren't what they should be and
2870720	2875920	they're outdated and they're predicated to some degree on deceit. And people who use power can
2875920	2882000	manipulate them sometimes successfully. That problem never goes away and it never will. But
2884480	2892320	when the evil can be easily located somewhere else, then you have every moral right to allow your
2892320	2899040	unexamined motivations to manifest themselves fully because you can punish the evildoers and
2899040	2903440	always remain on the moral side of the fence. There's a huge attractiveness in that.
2904160	2908000	I think, I mean, this is something you've explored a lot with the idea of the Solzhenitsyn's
2908000	2914080	idea about the good and evil cutting through the heart of every human being. Because that, to me,
2915840	2919840	it really gets to the heart of a lot of what I would call a kind of infantile culture. I think
2919840	2927760	this is a symptom of childishness. Whenever I was learning about literature and what
2927760	2932320	constituted more sophisticated literature and what didn't, Disney films, childish films,
2932320	2936960	let's take Tolkien, for instance, good people look, sorry, bad people look bad, they look like
2936960	2940800	orcs, they're ugly, and they are villains, and then there are heroes and they are good,
2940800	2945760	there isn't complexity. And if you have a more complex novel, like a Mervyn Peake novel where
2945760	2949280	people aren't necessarily good or bad, they're both, they struggle within themselves and with
2949280	2954480	other people, that is a mark of a kind of adult novel as opposed to a childish novel, right? And
2954480	2958640	that's quite an important distinction. And I think most of the political and ideological battles
2958640	2962640	that I find myself in the middle of, and I'm sure you do as well, are because people are just
2962640	2968080	reducing everything to this binary of good versus evil and putting themselves on the side of good.
2968880	2977600	It is a very infantile, almost like a caricature of religion. And I see it again and again,
2977600	2981600	we had it in this country with the Brexit vote, effectively, what happened in the vote here.
2981600	2986080	And the reason why it became so toxic and families fell apart, and you wouldn't believe,
2986080	2990080	I know it wasn't reported very much elsewhere, but it was like a kind of ideological civil war
2990080	2994400	here, but not a very sophisticated one, because it came down to this narrative that if you voted
2994400	2999840	to leave the EU, you were evil, racist, stupid. And if you voted to remain, you were good and
2999840	3004400	progressive, and all the rest and noble and virtuous, right? And of course, there are all
3004400	3010000	sorts of good reasons to have voted either way. And this kind of caricature, and it happens again
3010080	3016960	with... Well, you described it as a caricature of religion. And I think that's what an ideology is.
3017520	3025600	And this is one of the reasons that I've been inclined, let's say, to go to have my shot at the
3025600	3031600	rational atheists, much as I'm a fan of enlightenment thinking. I mean, I was convinced,
3031600	3038000	as a consequence of reading Jung primarily, but also Dostoevsky and also Nietzsche primarily,
3038000	3045520	and Solzhenitsyn, I would say, as well, that... And then biology as well, as I studied that more
3045520	3057200	deeply. There's no escaping a religious framework. There's no way out of it. And if you eliminate it,
3057840	3064160	say, as a consequence of rational criticism, what you inevitably produce is its replacement by
3064960	3067840	forms of religion that are much less sophisticated. I mean...
3069360	3074720	Well, it's not religion. It's a fundamentalist religion. You know, if I look back to my Catholic
3074720	3080160	upbringing, actually acknowledging your own capacity for sin is at the heart of Catholicism.
3080160	3084080	That's why we have the confessional. That's why you sit there and tell this stranger all these
3084080	3091760	things you've done wrong. Because it's reckoning with it. Well, that's far from trivial. It's
3091760	3097680	unbelievably not trivial. And because it was so common, like a common part of Catholicism,
3097680	3105360	it can be passed over without notice. And so the religious structures that we inherited,
3105360	3109840	I'm going to talk about Christianity most specifically, because it's the dominant form of...
3110800	3116000	It's the form of religious belief that primarily undergirds our social structures.
3116000	3120960	It's our operating system. My producer came up with that term the other day, and I thought it was
3120960	3130000	apt. And it does localize the drama between good and evil inside and makes you responsible for that
3131360	3138400	and encourages you, let's say, to attend to the ways that you fall short of the ideal. And
3139280	3144320	when you criticize a structure like that out of existence, you don't criticize the questions that
3144320	3151280	gave rise to it out of existence. And the questions might be, well, what's the nature of the good?
3151280	3155440	What's the nature of evil? Those are religious questions. What's the purpose of our life?
3156720	3161920	How do you orient yourself if you're trying to move up, let's say, rather than down?
3162960	3167440	How should you conduct yourself, et cetera, et cetera? Those questions don't go away.
3167680	3175440	They can't not be answered. And so the way that a traditional religious structure answers them is,
3176080	3181920	in a mysterious way, it uses ritual, it uses music, it uses art, it uses literature, it uses
3181920	3187200	stories, all these things that are outside the realm of easy criticism. And then some of that's
3187200	3193680	translated into comprehensible, explicit dogma, and that's the part that's most susceptible to
3193680	3199600	rational criticism. But when that disappears, I've been thinking about this a lot this week,
3199600	3205280	because of what happened to Richard Dawkins recently. And I have my differences with Dawkins
3205280	3210480	and the rest of the rational atheists, because I think that they underestimated the danger of
3210480	3217200	dispensing with what they were attempting to dispense with. And I see the influx of religious
3217200	3224240	fervor associated with political ideas as a direct consequence of the lack of separation,
3224240	3227760	let's say, between church and state, psychologically.
3227760	3234240	But Dawkins has fallen foul of this new religion, but his case actually really is
3234960	3238880	testimony to what we're talking about, that this is not a religion in a traditional sense,
3238880	3242880	it is an infantile religion that only sees things in binaries of good and evil, because
3242960	3248960	he was effectively, he was posing a question about identity. He was saying, if it is possible for
3248960	3255600	Rachel Dollazal to identify as black, why is she universally condemned and derided,
3255600	3260400	but somebody can identify as the opposite sex, and they are celebrated. And all he was doing
3260400	3264880	was posing the question, he wasn't even actually making a claim.
3264880	3268960	Yeah, well, he was doing, he was doing what a scientist actually does. I mean, I've been shocked
3269920	3275360	frequently in my interactions with journalists, because I've worked as a scientist for three
3275360	3280320	decades, and I'm accustomed to the way that scientists think and speak. And when I'm sitting
3280320	3285840	around with my graduate students, and there's a problem or an issue, what they do, and my colleagues
3285840	3290880	as well, is generate a bunch of hypotheses about why that might be. They don't necessarily believe
3290880	3298000	them, but the first trick is to generate as many, what would you say, hypotheses, I said that already,
3298080	3302240	that might account for it, ranging from biological through social, etc.
3302240	3306400	And that is exactly what Dawkins did. He even said that's what he was doing.
3306400	3311200	That puts you on the side of the devil. I mean, there was a viral tweet this week from a teacher
3311200	3315440	saying, I will never allow my pupils to play devil's advocate. I will never allow that in the
3315440	3319600	class, because some views are oppressive and are not to be entertained. I mean,
3320560	3324000	but that's the point. That's why the Vatican will call in a devil's advocate when someone is
3324000	3328560	potentially being canonized. Well, if you can't play devil's advocate, you can't think.
3329440	3335440	You have to have a devil's advocate in your head. If you don't have a devil's advocate in your head
3335440	3340080	torturing every thought you generate, you're not engaged in critical thinking.
3340080	3344880	Right. That's the scientific process to disprove yourself. I mean, that's what surprises me about
3345840	3351120	Richard Dawkins' response, because I think what he didn't realize is that he was caught in this
3351120	3357680	good versus evil binary, and he was the heretic now. He had been branded. He posed the question,
3357680	3365040	you're not meant to pose. And therefore, he's now outed himself as one of the demons. He's
3365040	3370480	there in pandemonium with the other demons. Now, so then he, of course, backtracked and
3370480	3376080	apologized and said, well, I didn't want to offend anyone. And of course, in an adult
3376160	3381840	rational world, that would be taken in good faith. And I don't think he fully appreciates
3381840	3386320	what's going on here, is that he's already marked himself as the sinner.
3386320	3391600	Well, here's his apology, let's say. Now, what he should have said, as far as I'm concerned,
3391600	3401520	here's what he said. I do not intend to disparage trans people. I see that my academic
3401520	3408080	disgust question has been misconstrued as such, and I deplore this. It was also not my attempt to
3408080	3415440	ally in any way with Republican bigots in the US now exploiting this issue. And so it's so interesting
3415440	3421280	that that's what he did, because- Well, it's buying into the tribalism thing. You know-
3421280	3429840	Well, it's also, it's not the best response to defend him. What he should have said was something
3429840	3437840	like, look, people, here's something to think about that I was posing. That's what scientists do.
3438400	3443840	And you didn't understand that, but that's not my problem. It's your lack of sophistication. But
3445120	3452400	instead of saying that, he immediately removed himself from the bad people, and that was the
3452400	3460240	Republican bigots, which just seems to me to pour fuel on the fire. And then he also said
3460800	3465840	that he didn't intend to disparage trans people, which isn't the issue at all.
3465840	3470000	Well, also, there was no implication in what he asked that he had ever intended to disparage
3470000	3473920	trans people. But to be fair to him, to be fair to him, I understand when you're caught in the
3473920	3478080	middle of a Twitter storm, you just want it to stop. And I've heard you talk about this as well,
3478080	3482640	is actually your response probably isn't going to be the best one. You just wanted to go away.
3482640	3486640	No, well, look, I mean, one of the things that's really worth pointing out here, and it's not
3486640	3491120	like I don't have sympathy for Dawkins. I have sympathy for Dawkins. I sent out a tweet defending
3491120	3496320	him yesterday. I mean, Dawkins is an admirable scientist. In my estimation, I learned lots from
3496320	3503840	reading his books. That doesn't mean I don't have my criticisms of Dawkins. But just because you have
3503840	3508560	criticisms of someone doesn't mean that they've never done anything worthwhile or that you haven't
3508560	3512400	learned something from them. And that's especially true in the scientific realm.
3519920	3526000	I just don't understand why. Okay, so back to the Twitter issue. So what I've seen repeatedly,
3526000	3531760	and this is worth some discussion, is when I'm watching Twitter, when I'm watching these attacks
3531840	3538080	on people, what I've seen the most general pattern of response to be is that it doesn't take very
3538080	3543600	many people attacking you on Twitter before it's seriously psychologically disturbing.
3544880	3549200	And that is interestingly related to this whole issue of hate speech that we've been discussing,
3549200	3554800	because it is the case that vicious attacks have quite a pronounced psychological effect,
3554800	3560880	especially if they're personal. And people generally fold and apologize instantly if my
3560880	3566400	sense is being if the Twitter mob is 20 people. It's sort of like they're reacting to 20 of their
3566400	3573280	neighbors showing up on their doorsteps with pitchforks and torches. And I think it's actually
3573280	3580400	an admirable response in some sense, because a well-socialized person actually does care what
3580400	3586880	their neighbors think. And if you offend 20 of your neighbors, it's possible 20 of your tribe,
3586960	3590960	it's possible that you've done something wrong. You might ask yourself that. Now, on Twitter,
3590960	3595600	you're connected to hundreds of thousands of people. And if you would offend 20,
3596160	3600080	it's not clear what that means. It might just mean that you said something.
3600080	3604320	It feels a lot worse than it actually is as well. It feels amplified, because there's all these people
3604320	3608320	who are strangers who know absolutely nothing about you. And it's particularly frustrating,
3608320	3613200	because more often than not, when it's happened to me, it's always been an imagined grievance.
3613200	3617040	It's not actually something I've said, it's something that they've assumed that I've said,
3617040	3621520	or a way that they have interpreted this. And the more you try and fight back against it,
3621520	3626880	or try and explain your actual position, the more they double down on their, and you've had this
3626880	3630320	as well, people are going after a figment of their own imagination, that's impossible to fend off.
3631520	3635520	And it does do psychological harm. And I've never denied that. And this is something I
3635520	3639600	addressed in the book, because I quoted, I can't remember her name now, but a writer talking about
3639600	3646000	how hate speech could be said to be violence, insofar as the psychological impact can have,
3646000	3650400	it can have a physiological impact, it can make you sick, it can make you unwell, the impact of
3650400	3656800	words. But of course, the example I use is taxation, I could fall physically sick, because I'm
3656800	3660000	under stress from being overly taxed by the government. Does that mean that the government
3660000	3664000	has committed an act of violence against me? It could be applied to absolutely anything, I think.
3664000	3666800	Well, an anarchist would argue yes.
3666880	3671840	Right, sure, exactly. But that wouldn't be me. But you could apply that to absolutely any
3671840	3676880	conceivable scenario, where anything that has happened to you has led to stress and physical
3676880	3680880	degeneration. And so I don't think it's right to single speech out and say,
3680880	3685680	speech is, but we can say that that's fine. Well, also, it's a one-sided argument, because
3686800	3691440	dangerous as speech, free speech is, we don't ever have to deny that there's such a thing as
3691440	3697600	hateful speech or damaging speech or corrosive speech or untruth speech or pathological speech
3697600	3704560	in every possible direction. That isn't the issue. The issue is, what's more dangerous to
3704560	3710400	regulate it or to leave it be, despite its dangers? That's the only rational argument,
3710400	3715600	or the only complete argument, let's say. Even if you have the most repugnant character who is
3715600	3720880	advocating the most vile ideas about society and attempting to proselytise even someone who's
3720880	3726480	attempting to recruit people to his or her cause, even something as vicious as neo-Naziism or something
3726480	3731120	like that, the question isn't, do I support what that person is saying? Because obviously,
3731120	3738080	we don't. The question is, do you take a few instances of people behaving in this way and use
3738080	3743280	that as a reason, a justification to empower the state to make a decision about what people
3743280	3748400	can say and think? That's the bigger principle that's at stake here. I worry that with social
3748400	3752800	media and Twitter as well, is that we end up buying into the illusion that there are more
3752800	3757280	hateful people in the world than there actually are, because even the people who send these hateful
3757280	3761680	things probably wouldn't behave like that in real life. There's something about the online world,
3761680	3766640	and what it does is absolutely, I mean, this is the heart of cancel culture. This is why it works.
3766640	3770800	Like you said, it's just a few tweets. That's all it takes. I've seen situations where companies
3770800	3776480	and corporations will backtrack on a policy just because of one or two tweets, because they fear
3776560	3784480	this deluge of people. It has such disproportionate power, and often with this kind of
3784480	3789280	cancel culture, it is often about something that someone hasn't even said. The example of Dawkins
3789280	3794000	is perfect, because a lot of the people and some prominent people I saw were saying, look,
3794000	3799600	Dawkins is now outed himself as a transphobe. If you said to them, where is the transphobic thing?
3799600	3804560	You him today, you tomorrow, buckle. Well, quite, because if someone is transphobic,
3804560	3810480	simply because you've decided that. It was the same with JK Rowling. It became suddenly
3811120	3816400	quite normal for commentators on the mainstream media to say that she has said transphobic things.
3816400	3822080	Well, where? Because I've read her comments and her essay on the trans issue that she posted on
3822080	3827840	her blog, and it was a long essay, which was very compassionate and nuanced, and at no point,
3827840	3831680	it's the opposite. She says that she supports trans rights, and she would stand there against
3831680	3835680	any discrimination. And I've been in these fights all the time. If ever you ask someone to say,
3835680	3841680	can you just quote the transphobic thing that she said, they never can? And an adult would say,
3841680	3845600	okay, I can't find the evidence of my preconception, so therefore I should revise
3845600	3851120	my view. But they don't. They double down on it, and they find these sort of, they use
3851120	3858080	casuistry and whatever linguistic semantic tricks they can to come background to the
3858080	3862320	conclusion they'd already decided. Same with Dawkins. I mean, not just the American Humanist
3862320	3866640	Association. I saw a major blogger saying that anyone who was defending him is transphobic.
3867200	3871440	And like, well, if that's all it takes to be smeared in this way, if it doesn't matter what you
3871440	3876240	say, if all that matters is what people decide that you believe, then I suppose this goes back
3876240	3880480	to this pseudo reality we were discussing. Well, I guess what Dawkins got in trouble for,
3880480	3886400	let's take it apart a bit, okay? Because it's worth doing. He said, this is his original tweet,
3886400	3895840	in 2015, Rachel Dolezal, a white chapter president of NAACP, was vilified for identifying as black.
3897040	3904160	Some men choose to identify as women, and some women choose to identify as men. You will be
3904160	3910880	vilified if you deny that they literally are what they identify as. Discuss. Okay, so we put
3910880	3920480	forth a set of propositions, but the proposition has a point. And the point is, what is it that you
3920480	3930960	can and can't identify with? And what power do people have to enforce their decision on others?
3931680	3936880	And that's really the question he's asking if you strip it down. And that is actually a question
3936880	3941600	that's very threatening to, well, let's see, who would it be threatening to? Well, it would be
3941600	3948640	threatening to anyone who insists that you can choose an identity, say, in the realm of gender,
3948640	3954400	and that you should have the right to enforce your choice, despite other people's opinions,
3954400	3959280	let's say. So he's asking, why is there an inherent contradiction in the intersectional
3959920	3967200	discourse? Why is it that racial identity is not malleable, and in fact has to be strictly
3967200	3972960	policed? Hence why we have all these debates about cultural appropriation. Why is that so rigid?
3972960	3977040	And yet, even if the lived experience, let's go back to that, the lived experience of the person
3977040	3982240	tells them otherwise. I mean, Rachel Dollazelle wrote a whole book in which she outlines how she
3983040	3987120	feels that she has always been black. It isn't just, I choose to be black one day, it is something
3987680	3993120	her lived experience is that, in essence, she is. So why is that to be vilified universally
3993120	3998080	without question and there's no discussion to be had here? And yet, someone who chooses,
3998960	4005120	you know, that gender identity is something that is malleable and open to options and actually
4005120	4009520	infinite options. Why? And I think there is a contradiction. Well, maybe he's vilified because
4009520	4014560	he asked a question that's at the heart of the problem with identity politics, period. I mean,
4014560	4018160	particularly because when it comes to race, I mean, virtually all intersectionists would accept
4018160	4021920	that race is socially constructed. This is something they're always talking about. And so
4021920	4027520	therefore, in a sense, there is more of a case for transracialism. If you want to say that it is
4027520	4032480	an identity that can be mixed. Well, in some sense, we already accept transracialism as a given. And
4032480	4043120	so here's something I might as well get in trouble for this. Well, if your ancestry is 95% Caucasian
4043120	4053440	and 5% non Caucasian Asian black, let's say, you're not Caucasian. Generally speaking, you can
4053440	4057680	identify with the minority group. And so at some point, the question becomes, well,
4059280	4064240	it's a ridiculous question, which is why the whole notion of group identity construed in this way
4064240	4072240	is so pathological. But we obviously accept some degree of transracial identification if
4073840	4080400	your racial group is disproportionately in one category, but you identify with the other,
4080400	4084160	and that's instantly not only accepted, it's standard practice.
4084160	4088720	Right. And I'm with the intersectionists on this. And so far as race, we're all the same. You know,
4088720	4092880	at ever since we've broken down the human genome, we know there are no differences between us. So
4093440	4100320	this idea that it must be so rigidly policed, this social construct, these arbitrary ideas,
4100320	4105120	and yet gender, I mean, I think it's something. Okay, so now we know why now we know exactly why
4105120	4109680	Dawkins got himself in so much trouble. Well, okay, you know, put his finger. Well, it will,
4109680	4115360	for sure, for sure. But magical super Nazis are always in trouble. So you know, exactly. But
4115360	4122240	then with the question of the gender identity debate, but this is the debate we need to be
4122240	4127120	having is actually the other thing he put his finger on there is that actually people are arguing
4127120	4133200	with different definitions in their heads, you know, for the identitarians, the idea of a woman,
4134080	4140480	a woman is an identity, it isn't a biological reality. But for most people, the classification
4140480	4146320	of woman is biological reality, not identity. So in other words, and why is it that we cannot
4146320	4150240	have that discussion? So okay, so you believe this thing, we believe the other. And that's why
4150320	4154800	we're at loggerheads. But let's let's have the discussion. Why can that not happen? Why does it
4154800	4159360	have to be if you've decided? Well, that's what we're that's actually what we're trying to unpack
4159360	4163920	is what's the motivation at the root of this. And it seems to me, I do believe it's something like
4164800	4169520	a pronounced infantilism. I mean, one of the things I've been toying with is the idea that
4169520	4181360	the the gender that the demand for gender fluidity in late adolescence, let's say,
4182000	4188080	is something like the consequence of insufficient fantasy play in childhood.
4189680	4197760	That that I remember, for example, when my son was little, his sister and her friends
4197760	4203200	used to dress him up as a fairy princess. They did this with some regularity. And I kind of cast
4203200	4207680	a dim eye on that. But I thought it through. And, you know, it sort of disturbed me. And then I
4207680	4212800	thought it through. And I thought, wait a second here, leave the kid alone, leave the girls alone.
4212800	4219120	He is playing out what it means to be female in dramatic play. And he needs to do that because
4219120	4224240	otherwise he can't understand what it means to be female. That's how children understand,
4224240	4229600	that's how adults understand things. For God's sake, we go to a movie and we watch someone play
4229600	4234880	out of female and we identify with that because otherwise we wouldn't be enjoying the movie and
4234880	4240480	we get we get a bit of a clue about what it's like to inhabit someone else's skin. So there's
4240480	4248080	this necessity for play in gender roles and that has to manifest itself. And if the play has been
4248160	4255280	interrupted, let's say by electronic equipment, for example, or any of the other things that
4255280	4260640	might be interrupting it, well, maybe that desire comes back with a vengeance later. And I have to
4260640	4266160	be whoever I say I am. I have to be able to play with this. And well, if it's a developmental
4266160	4271600	requirement, there's going to be a lot of insistence behind it. And it looks immature and it is because
4271600	4275680	it should have happened earlier. Most people stabilize their gender identity by the time
4275680	4283120	they're three or four. But it doesn't always happen. So there is an infantilism in this demand
4283120	4289360	for fluidity of identity, this insistence that other people play the game that I insist they're
4289360	4294000	going to play. And then what about the idea that the gender critical feminists would come in and say,
4294000	4299920	well, the idea of a boy dressing up in a dress, there's nothing inherently female about that or
4299920	4304880	feminine about that in any case that all of this is a construct anyway. And why can't we let the
4304880	4308960	kids just some kids are not gender conforming and they can just do what they want. I mean,
4310160	4316640	the concern I have with the current identity obsessed ideology is that they see a boy in a dress
4317280	4324000	and they will say, well, he could potentially be a woman. And by doing so are reinforcing the most
4324000	4332800	conservative views of gender to begin with. And that to me, I'm intuitively against that because
4332800	4338160	I wasn't a gender conforming. I didn't play football with the other boys. I didn't dress up in
4338160	4346080	dresses, but I may have done if they were lying around. I find it very odd that this supposedly
4346080	4353760	progressive radical movement is so dependent on the idea of very, very traditional unyielding
4353760	4357040	notions of what it is to be male and what it is to be female.
4357040	4367440	Yeah, but only in the case where the identity is across the sex. So you can be, if you're a man
4367440	4373120	who believes he's a woman, that's inviolable and has a biological reference point. But if you're
4373120	4378720	a woman who thinks she's a woman, it doesn't. It's completely malleable. And so that's an
4378720	4384080	inherent contradiction again. And it's worthy of discussion, surely. And the contradiction
4384160	4388640	doesn't just go away because you won't allow the conversation to happen, which is a contradiction
4388640	4394880	gets played out in in actuality if you don't allow it to be dealt with in abstraction.
4395520	4400160	So then the question is, how do we break through? And I mean, this is something I've been
4401600	4406240	really, really thinking about is that it isn't no, it's no longer just a matter of trying to
4406240	4412000	persuade people. It's almost trying to de-radicalize people at this point. How do I explain to
4412000	4415680	someone the world isn't this fantasy world that you've created in your head, where it's just
4415680	4420240	it's full of transphones and neo-Nazis and all these and good versus evil. The world is actually
4420240	4424720	much more complex and nuanced and requires discussion and thought. How do you break through
4424720	4428800	someone's fantasy so that we can have that discussion? Well, it used to be that you sent
4428800	4433360	them to the university so they could study humanities. That's the last thing you should do
4433360	4438240	now. Well, that was the answer. I mean, that was the whole point, right, to to make people more
4438240	4444640	sophisticated in their conceptions. And in which cases, is it the case that it's over now? If people
4444640	4451120	were to be educated out of those problems and now that actually the higher education itself has
4451120	4455200	become so ideologically driven that to go to university means you end up more indoctrinated
4455200	4459520	than when you went there. What hope is there? I feel like I'm, I sound a bit frustrated here,
4459520	4463920	but I feel like I'm bashing my head against a brick wall because half, most of the time when
4464000	4468800	I'm caught in an argument with these ideologues, they are arguing, like I say, with a monster
4468800	4471920	they've created in their own heads. I'm not the person they think I am. I don't have the values
4471920	4476640	they think I have. And therefore, the discussion is stymied from the outset. And it does make me
4476640	4481600	very frustrated. And that's probably the real reason I wrote the book, actually, because I want
4481600	4485520	I want the idea of free speech to be elevated again as a sacrosanct principle,
4485520	4489120	so that we can have these conversations and so that people don't get demonized and
4489120	4494480	attacked for things they don't believe. And so that we can reach some kind of consensus
4495280	4498320	on these issues that we've been describing, these contentious issues, because when you have an issue
4498320	4502240	that's particularly tendentious, you, it requires more conversation, it requires more discussion
4502240	4505440	and more understanding. And I don't think we're getting that at the moment.
4506000	4510800	Yeah, well, I guess I'm somewhat optimistic about that, because I can see all the possibility that
4511200	4516400	long form conversations of this sort bring.
4516400	4520960	Well, there's an appetite for them, isn't there? But is there an appetite for them
4520960	4525920	from the activists and the ideologues who have seen so much control in our major educational
4525920	4526920	cultural institutions?
4526920	4533600	Yeah, I think so. I think so. I think so. I mean, I've been struck by how deep the hunger
4533680	4539200	how deep the hunger is for for genuine conversation and very much heartened by it.
4539920	4542720	And so that's a counter movement.
4543280	4548240	I hope you're right. I just don't see any evidence of that from the people I'm talking about. I
4548240	4551600	don't see it from the people who will say to educate yourself.
4551600	4556000	It's another problem too, though, isn't it with Twitter, for example, is that it's never the same
4556000	4562880	people. And that plays with us psychologically, because of course, we are built to more or less
4562880	4569920	assume that we're interacting with a continuous community. And we aren't. We're interacting
4569920	4576160	with a discontinuous community on Twitter. And so we're led astray in our presuppositions constantly.
4576960	4582160	But it's worse than that. Because it isn't... I know it's different people all the time,
4582160	4585760	but they all have the same views on absolutely everything. It feels like you're arguing with
4585760	4590000	the Borg. It feels like just one mind speaking through many, many voices.
4590000	4593920	Yes, well, it is. Then that's the hallmark of an ideology. It is precisely that.
4595680	4599600	Then I guess it's a matter of it's certainly and it's a matter of trying to understand the
4599600	4603200	ideology ever more deeply to see what it's actually focused on.
4603200	4607600	But I do read their books and I do read their articles and I do try to understand.
4607600	4611760	I don't believe the people I'm talking about return the favor. They always use the phrase
4611760	4618080	educate yourself. And what they mean by that is read these select books and digest them uncritically.
4618080	4623280	That's what they mean by educate yourself. They don't mean read widely and tackle the
4623280	4627360	various views and come to a conclusion yourself. The last thing they want is critical thought.
4627360	4631600	Critical thought is the enemy. Ironically, it's the enemy of critical theory.
4631600	4635360	No, it's a hallmark of white supremacy culture as far as I can see, right?
4635360	4637360	That's what they say. But that's what they claim.
4637360	4642800	It's amazing too to see that set of ideas propagate itself across the culture so quickly.
4643200	4648480	The Canadian federal government in its diversity, inclusivity and equity training program
4648480	4655040	now uses those concepts like associating white supremacy with punctuality, for example.
4655040	4660880	They use those in the training of their civil servants. It's been accepted wholeheartedly to
4660880	4665120	that degree. I've seen them. I've seen the screenshots that often get leaked of these
4665120	4670240	training sessions and it bullet pointed hallmarks of white supremacy, punctuality,
4670240	4672560	politeness, hard work. Perfectionism.
4672560	4677360	Yeah. All these noble things. I'm thinking, well, if I was a person of color, I would be
4677360	4682560	outraged by this, this idea that this is a culture that's alien to me. It's so offensive.
4684560	4690000	But so absurd. You can hardly mount an argument against it. I mean,
4690000	4696880	conscientiousness is a personality trait and there's no racial differences in conscientiousness.
4697440	4703360	Right. And it wouldn't matter to me. If it was just a few idiots on Twitter or these extreme,
4703360	4708640	it wouldn't matter to me, but these people have disproportionate power, institutional power,
4708640	4714240	political power. I mean, the Biden administration is on side with an awful lot of this kind of stuff
4714240	4721920	and the end point. So is the Trudeau government. I mean, to have this in the training documentation
4721920	4725920	that's produced by the federal government is just absolutely stunning. It's also the document
4725920	4730320	that I was referring to. I tweeted about it yesterday. It's so badly written that it's
4732240	4738320	stunning. It's maddening with him. And how is it he's got away with his history of blackface,
4738320	4743120	for instance? How is it that there is no consistency there? Like, you know, it's
4743120	4747040	lack of effective opposition is a big part of it. It's insane. I mean, if you look at those old
4747040	4750560	videos, it looks like he spent more time in blackface than out of it. And yet he isn't the one
4750560	4754480	who's being attacked and vilified for that. It's okay. He's got a free pass. It's weird to me.
4754480	4759360	Yeah, well, the opposition in Canada, and this is a problem in general, is a real problem for
4759360	4765120	our entire culture, is that the woke narrative is very romantically attractive. It's got this
4765120	4770480	rebelliousness about it and this impetus to go out and march in the streets and, you know, to
4770480	4776080	work on a global cause. And like traditional conservatives and even traditional liberals
4776080	4782880	can't mount a counter narrative. They don't have the imagination. And it's a huge problem.
4782960	4786720	The trouble is, though, the cause that they're fighting for is largely illusory,
4786720	4792000	and that to me is very frightening. We've had people in this country claim that our major
4792000	4796080	universities, such as Oxford and Cambridge, are structurally institutionally racist. All of the
4796080	4801120	data tells us this is just simply not the case. Oh, yes. Well, that's just happening constantly
4801120	4806480	in Canadian universities. The McGill physics department has now put out a diversity inclusivity
4806480	4811760	and equity statement that's predicated on exactly those views.
4812320	4818080	Well, I think we need to push back against this particular hyper-racialization of society,
4818080	4823360	because it is reinscribing old racial tropes, even to the extent of fear of miscegenation,
4823360	4827600	this old racist idea of this fear of mixed couples. You know, there was an article in
4827600	4832640	The Guardian here recently talking about how finding mixed race people attractive is problematic.
4833360	4838800	It's almost just taking old racist ideas and just giving them a kind of hint of respectability.
4838880	4844160	Of course, the end point of that is segregation. You saw presumably the story in California,
4844160	4849360	the Brentwood School, the elite school that segregated its parents, but on their, what was
4849360	4853040	it, a dialogue session with the teachers, and you would have white parents in one room and
4853040	4856000	black parents in the other room. You're seeing that in convocation ceremonies at universities, too.
4857280	4863360	How can this be anything other than racist? It's interesting that the group, Fair, the
4863360	4867600	group Foundation Against Intolerance and Racism, a lot of those people who are doing great work,
4867600	4874080	I think, are starting to call this neo-racism. There needs to be a label for it. I think maybe
4874080	4878560	that's the right way to go about it, because the word racism has almost become meaningless,
4878560	4884320	because the people who use it the most, they throw it around so liberally. I never believe it when I
4884320	4889040	hear someone branded that way. I assume it's someone not being honest and not being truthful.
4889040	4893200	So what do we call this? What do you call it when people are advancing the cause of racial
4893200	4898640	segregation in the name of anti-racism? What do you call that? I think that's going to be the
4898640	4902960	real struggle. It's not just breaking through the fantasy world. I don't like this idea of
4902960	4907280	having to negotiate someone else's dreamland. There's that thing, firstly, but also there's
4907280	4911360	the linguistic mind fields. How do you convince people? The other reason, I mean, you mentioned
4911360	4916080	the rebellious aspect of it, I think the other reason why it's so appealing is because the language
4916080	4922800	sounds like you're doing good. Social justice, anti-racism. Who wouldn't be anti-racist? Black
4922880	4929120	lives matter. Of course they do. Who would disagree with that? But these phrasing can be used to push
4929120	4934800	through some very pernicious ideas. I mean, when it comes to anti-racism, for instance, I mean,
4934800	4939840	Ibrahim X. Kendi makes it absolutely clear in his book that he feels to be not racist is simply
4939840	4946800	another form of racism, that this dichotomy doesn't exist. Well, and that's why I find it very hard
4946800	4951040	when I'm having these arguments, because if I say I have a real problem with anti-racism,
4951040	4955760	people will say, oh, I see. So you're for racism. And then you have to explain what anti-racism means
4955760	4959600	when used by these academics in these very niche fields such as whiteness studies. You have to
4959600	4965920	explain first what that means, why that's dangerous for society, and how in order to genuinely oppose
4965920	4970080	racism, you have to oppose the discourse of anti-racism. I mean, when you say it like that,
4970080	4977120	it's maddening, isn't it? It's like, it's the stuff of nightmares, because there is no coherent
4977200	4983200	sense. And because so much of it is rooted in language and misdirection through language and
4983200	4989360	shielding what is actually meant, it becomes impossible to win the argument. And maybe that's
4989360	4996240	the point. Maybe this, they gave the word to us, gaslighting. When they gaslight all the time and
4996240	5001680	say the culture war is a right-wing myth, or cancel the people who are the chief practitioners of
5001680	5006000	cancer culture saying that cancer culture doesn't exist, when they say the opposite of what is the
5006080	5013760	observable reality. I don't know how to break through that, how to break through those arguments,
5013760	5017440	because not only have they constructed a pseudo-reality in their own minds,
5017440	5021200	they've constructed the language with which to sustain that pseudo-reality,
5021200	5025520	so no one else can be drawn out of it. And that to me is going to be the challenge.
5027680	5032800	Let me ask you, let's go sideways for a minute now. And I suppose this is an exploration of
5032800	5038080	potential solutions as well. This has been a very serious conversation, but you're a satirist and
5038080	5043360	a comedian as well. And so you have to... Isn't it terrible how unfunny I am in real life? Isn't
5043360	5048240	that awful? When I'm doing stand-up, if I've got a script, I can be funny, but I can't be funny
5048240	5054400	spontaneously. People are very disappointed about that. I'm sorry. Well, I'm curious about your
5054400	5060560	motivations. Let's talk about Titania McGrath. Why don't you define, describe her first for everyone?
5061360	5068640	So Titania McGrath originated as a Twitter character in around April 2018. And the idea of
5068640	5075840	the character is that she is a very privileged, po-faced, young, white, intersectional activist
5075840	5080320	who is determined to be offended by absolutely anything. She can problematize absolutely anything.
5080320	5086720	You know, you could give her a pair of shoes or a hat or a holiday in Margate, and she would find a
5086720	5091440	way to say that it is irredeemably transphobic and white supremacist or something like that.
5091440	5095680	She can do those things that the activists always do. So nothing is ever good enough for her. She's
5095680	5100400	also immensely privileged. She comes from well, independently wealthy background. She lives in,
5100400	5108960	you know, one of those sort of gated communities, which is 99% white. But she has a deep mistrust
5108960	5116480	of the working class. But she thinks that she is virtuous and noble and good, and she goes on
5116480	5123840	Twitter and it goes on the attack all the time, trying to isolate things, trying to save the
5123840	5129680	world in her through intersectional theory. And it's a very recognizable type of act,
5129680	5133440	even if you know nothing about intersectionality or anything of the stuff that came out of
5133440	5136720	the School of Thought of Kimberly Crenshaw or any of those academics, even if you know nothing
5136720	5142080	about that, you will recognize this type of figure because this figure is ubiquitous on Twitter,
5142080	5148080	on social media. They always have their pronouns in their bio. They always use the same terminology
5148080	5153680	such as hegemony or discourse or problematic or phallogocentric, if you want to go back to
5153680	5159360	Derrida, you know, and she knows the right jargon to use lived experience, cultural appropriation,
5159360	5164160	mansplaining, toxic masculinity, all of those kind of things. And we know, and all of these things
5164160	5168880	tend to be slogans in substitute of thought, you know, that they're just things that get thrown
5168880	5173840	out there. And so what I wanted to do with the character is in slogan means what do you mean
5173840	5179360	is etymologically? No, I don't sluag garrum. It means battle cry of the dead. I love that.
5183360	5188000	That doesn't send a chill up your back. You didn't understand it. Well, that's this is it.
5188640	5194640	I'm going to use that. That's great because that it is a kind of it's almost like a battleground
5194720	5200000	of zombies who don't have any capacity for independent thought anymore. I mean, you try
5200000	5204800	to get into a conversation with someone like this. And I have many times. Well, sure. Very
5204800	5210800	publicly. And the slogans that come back at you all the time. And the lack of interrogation of
5210800	5214880	those slogans, you know, but what I find so frustrating and so horrifying in some sense,
5214880	5220080	I mean, I think a great canonical example of that is the interview that Helen Lewis did with me
5220080	5226720	for the for GQ, which is it's now more popular online than the Channel 4 interview, which I
5226720	5232240	think the GQ interview has like 32 million views or something preposterous. But I never
5232240	5239600	did talk to Helen Lewis. I just talked to the ideology and it's not I don't like that. I like
5239600	5245040	to talk to the person and find out what they think. But I heard you saying as well that
5245040	5252880	before the interview, she was very frosty and almost as though she had decided what you were
5252880	5258000	in advance, funnily enough. Oh, there was no almost. I definitely decided what I was before
5258000	5263680	the before the discussion. Yeah, exactly. And she's been beating the same drum more recently
5263680	5268560	as well, which has driven many people to the interview because she published an article in
5268560	5274400	the Atlantic Monthly and in another locale as well. So when you're faced with those, I mean,
5274960	5281440	I just see it all the time so often. And to give another recent example that we had the obviously
5281440	5286640	since the Harry and Meghan interview with Oprah Winfrey. And there was a controversy over here
5286640	5291200	because Piers Morgan, who hosts a show called Good Morning Britain, got into an argument with
5291200	5296320	another colleague on the show, Mancoyl Alex Beresford, I think. And it was really interesting
5296320	5300480	watching once they'd had the argument, they sat down, they tried to talk through the issues.
5300480	5303920	And Piers Morgan pointed out that some of the things that Meghan had said in the interview
5303920	5309040	were factually wrong and had been proven to be factually wrong. His response was Alex Beresford's
5309040	5313280	response was, but that's her lived experience. And then he said, yes, but we have the evidence
5313280	5317680	here that it is factually incorrect. And again, he said, but it's her lived experience. So in other
5317680	5323520	words, see, that's that insistence that the fantasy world, the subjective world trumps everything.
5323520	5330240	Right. And that once you've, it's almost like these, these phrases, if you use the right, if you
5330240	5333600	use the phrase lived experience or toxic masculinity, whatever, you're in the club,
5333600	5337600	what you've signaled that you're, you're, you're right. You know, and I know that academics have
5337600	5340560	always done this, you know, the jargon, you're in the group, you're in the in-group, if you've
5340560	5344000	got the right, if you know how to deploy the right words. But there's something more sinister
5344000	5348960	about this because it is morally right in these situations. That's the sinister thing.
5348960	5355280	That's it. It's morally incontrovertible. You've made the statement and that's it. And there's
5355280	5359360	no further discussion. Yes, well, you're not evil. That's what you're saying. I'm not evil.
5359920	5365120	So I think, so with, so the reason with Titania, I wanted her to be obsessed with this language.
5365120	5370320	And so, and, and, and why I read so much of this stuff so that I knew the way that they speak
5371200	5376960	is because I thought the best way to expose the inherent contradictions of, of, of that position
5376960	5382640	and the thoughtlessness moreover, the thoughtlessness of that position is, is, is to, to embody it in
5382640	5387360	a character. Right. So you were playing, you were playing a dramatic game, essentially,
5387360	5393040	which is a form of thought. In doing so, I've actually come to understand the people I'm
5393040	5397360	satirizing a whole lot more. And look, let's face it, every now and then they'll hit on a point that
5397360	5402480	is actually right. And, and, you know, even when I read White Fragility by Robin D'Angelo, which I
5402480	5406320	think is a terrible book and is, is, is so flawed throughout every now and then she'll hit on something
5406320	5410320	and you think for a moment, oh, there's something in that. And then she'll undercut it by saying,
5410320	5413680	well, everyone's a racist and all the rest of it, you know, and it just goes back to being absurd.
5414320	5419040	But, and that book in of itself is a very good example of this, you know, setting up a reality
5419040	5424960	that cannot be penetrated because she will say that any kind of critical questioning of her
5424960	5429680	position is evidence of the very pervasiveness of white supremacy that she's identified. So you
5429680	5434720	can't win because even engaging in a discussion is proof of your malevolence, according to her
5434720	5440080	theory, it's absolutely hopeless. But I thought, I thought, I thought because the movement is so
5440080	5445680	riven with contradiction, actually, the more effective way of tackling it isn't through dialogue,
5445680	5451040	firstly, because the people I'm talking about seem impervious to reason. They mistrust dialogue,
5451040	5454640	they see debate as a form of violence. So you're never going to get through to them that way.
5454640	5457840	Yeah, and that that's actually an explicit part of the theory.
5457840	5462400	It really is. So then in creating a satirical character, it's not that they're anti free
5462400	5468000	speech, there's no such thing as free speech in that theoretical framework. No, it's a misapprehension
5468000	5472240	all the way down to the bottom, which is why I get so frustrated. I've often been in debates
5472240	5476880	where I've tried to invite these very people to participate in the debate to hear them out.
5476880	5482640	And they would say that to even appear would be to dignify the position. So it's an absolute
5483200	5488560	nightmare. And it also protects themselves from potential criticism, which is, of course,
5488560	5493360	the whole point. But I thought by creating a satirical character that embodies those
5493440	5501120	contradictions, that thoughtlessness, it might reflect back onto them. I suppose how they look
5501120	5504960	to normal people, because I don't think they appreciate, I think they're so caught up within
5504960	5509200	their own little bubbles, with their own little groups, they never hear an alternative point
5509200	5513920	of view. I mean, I used to work with academics like this, who were so within their little groups,
5513920	5517840	and they're constantly quoting each other and supporting each other and giving the illusion
5517920	5523920	that their views cannot be disputed. But what if you're suddenly confronted
5523920	5528000	with how other people perceive you? And will that give you pause for thought?
5528000	5533280	Okay, so when you started Titania, you didn't announce that she was a satirical character.
5533280	5538000	You started playing on Twitter. Tell me the story. What exactly would happen? Because
5539040	5544400	that Twitter account became extraordinarily well known and very rapidly. So I'm curious about
5544640	5551200	how you did that and how you responded once it started to amass some cultural significance.
5551760	5559600	I was very surprised that it became so popular so quickly. And I'd started it
5560720	5564000	because I'm more to entertain myself more than anything. I was so frustrated with this,
5564000	5569440	and I wanted to try and expose the absurdity of it. I mean, my background is a stand-up comic.
5569440	5573840	And as a stand-up comic, I'm not necessarily satirical. I will stand there on a stage
5573840	5578640	and ridicule the thing that I perceive to be a problem with society. With satire,
5578640	5584800	what you're doing is you're often embodying it with a kind of ironic detachment or you're addressing it.
5585680	5589040	You're always going after what you perceive to be the vices and follies of society,
5589040	5593200	and I thought that was a good way of doing it. Right, so you had to stay on a kind of edge.
5593200	5599040	You had to be believable enough as the character so that you could pass, but you had to push it
5599040	5605920	just past the point of what? Of rationality or believability? It's a funny edge.
5606560	5609840	I was continually getting into arguments with people and staying in character. I've always
5609840	5614800	stayed in character even to today. And I've actually, if you go to the Titania account now,
5614800	5620720	my pinned thread is a thread of conversations that I've had with people in character who are
5620720	5624720	angry about the things I've tweeted. And these can go on for pages and pages. And it's fascinating
5624720	5630160	to me because it's close enough to the truth. She says really ridiculous things, really absurd
5630160	5635760	things like speaking or writing in English as an act of colonial violence. She'll say that.
5636560	5641200	The only way to guard against fascism is if the state are allowed to arrest people for what they
5641200	5646560	say and think. Stuff like this, which is so obviously absurd, and yet it's close enough
5646560	5652000	to what people actually say that people believe it and get annoyed about it. And what I've always
5652000	5658560	liked to do is to stay in character and have those conversations with these people. And then
5658560	5664080	I posted the screenshots of the conversation. But part of the point of that is not to humiliate the
5664080	5668240	people who had fallen for it, because actually the point I'm making is I understand why they would
5668240	5675360	fall for it because it's so close to what people actually say. And by doing that, my hope is,
5675360	5681760	I suppose, that it exposes the folly of this stuff. Sometimes even when I'm in those arguments,
5681760	5686880	I will say something that is so out of the, out of, you know, just completely out of the realm
5686880	5694560	of possibility, so stupid. And yet they still don't, things have become so absurd that they don't
5695440	5701200	twig. I mean, even today, there was a story today in the UK, a museum, a Jane Austen museum,
5701200	5706640	is now going to interrogate Jane Austen's use of sugar in her tea, because it has connections to
5706720	5711280	plantations and white supremacy and slavery. You know, something like that, which is just so
5711280	5717440	absurd, or the recent controversy over Bluey, the Australian cartoon dog, because it doesn't have
5717440	5723360	enough dogs of color and gender diverse dogs in the cartoon. Now, that sounds like something I would
5723360	5729040	make up as a joke. But it's real, it's actually happening and people are taking it seriously.
5729040	5734480	And so therefore, in a sense, it's become harder with Titania, because anything that I come up with
5735200	5739840	is going to be topped by real life very, very quickly.
5740720	5745920	So what have you learned about the people that Titania annoys? So she's a hyper politically
5745920	5753120	correct avatar, and but she tangles up people who are opposed to that sort of thing. And so that
5753120	5760720	must have also shed substantial light for you on people on the other side of the, and so what have
5760720	5766320	you learned? Well, one of the things is that the people on the other side, who might even be quite,
5767520	5772320	might even be of my opinion about these things. A lot of people are very quick to anger,
5773120	5780560	and verbal abuse as a goat, as an instant response. So a lot of the people who get
5780560	5786000	angry with her really go after her looks. And I mean, she's not real, a friend of mine, Lisa,
5786000	5790960	created the image of the woman is just a composite of four different women. So it's not a parody.
5790960	5794400	You see, this is the thing, it's not a parody of any particular person, it's a, it's a type of,
5794400	5800800	of person. And yeah, the people who get angry with her and the people who are genuinely angry
5800800	5805600	about the social justice movement are absolutely furious about the way it is impinging on every
5805600	5809280	aspect of their lives, they are sick of it. So when they see someone as extreme as Titania,
5809280	5813120	they really let rip. And I don't think that's healthy. You know, it's not in my nature to go
5813120	5819920	and abuse someone online or to get angry online. But I've seen the extent, what it shows, I suppose,
5819920	5826480	is that that kind of instinct to immediately go for the abusive or the vicious or the attack
5826480	5832640	or the ad hominem is present across the political spectrum. It's everywhere. Or maybe that's just
5832640	5840080	a sign of Twitter, maybe that's just a symptom of social media. And I've learned a lot about
5840080	5843920	how social media works. I think that's, that's another thing about it is that I've really,
5844960	5849440	for one thing, the fact that she's, she's been banned a number of times and I've learned how
5849440	5856000	to avoid the bans and about the way that big tech censors and how they censor and why.
5856000	5861920	What if, what does she be banned for? So the tweets that she was banned for a couple of times,
5861920	5866880	she's had a number of one day suspensions, a number of seven day suspensions. Once or twice,
5866960	5872240	it's been inexplicable to me why, why she would be banned. It seems a bit like someone at Silicon
5872240	5876480	Valley has twigged that their precious ideology is being mocked and they don't like it. That,
5876480	5881440	that's the only explanation I could think of. However, on a couple of instances, it's when she's,
5882240	5886080	I suppose, what they would say incited violence. And of course, she hasn't done anything of the
5886080	5891280	kind. There was one tweet where she said she was going to go to a UKIP rally. UKIP is a right-wing
5891280	5895920	nationalist political party in the UK. And she said, I'm going to go to this UKIP rally to punch
5895920	5900160	people in the name of compassion or love or something like that, you know, which is the idea
5900160	5905520	that a lot of these activists have that actually, whereas words are violence and awful, actual
5905520	5910720	physical violence can be defended, you know, in their, in their view, it's so perverse. And of course,
5910720	5916560	I was making a comment about the perversity of that idea that you think microaggressions are,
5916560	5921040	are actual violence, but you're perfectly content to go out and set fire to cars and beat
5921040	5924320	people up if they have the wrong opinion or pepper spray people in the face if they voted for
5924320	5927840	Trump. You know, there's an obvious, there's an obvious contradiction there that I was
5927840	5931680	trying to expose. So she had a ban there. I think that might have even been the one where
5931680	5936160	she was permanently banned. I had an email from Twitter saying, this is a permanent ban,
5936160	5940560	you're not getting back on. And then there was a bit of an outcry from, from, from people who
5940560	5945120	follow her, some prominent people who follow her, and Twitter rescinded that changed their minds
5945120	5949600	and brought her back. And as a result of that, inevitably, her follower count leapt because
5949600	5953280	of course, when you try and censor something, you draw attention to it, but you're always treading
5953360	5957680	a fine line. I mean, my friend, Lisa, who I mentioned, Lisa Graves used to have a Twitter
5957680	5962320	account called Jarvis de Pong, who was one of my favorite accounts on Twitter. And he was
5963280	5967360	banned, completely permanently banned. They actually went on a bit of a purge of satire
5967360	5973120	accounts. There was one afternoon where Twitter purged 12 or 13 satirical accounts and deleted
5973120	5978400	them. Titania came back for some reason, I think it's because she was the bigger account.
5978400	5982960	But a lot of them just got ditched. And that I think shows that, you know, the powers that
5982960	5987040	be at Silicon Valley, they don't like to be mocked. They don't, well, no one in authority likes to
5987040	5991520	be mocked. It's the best way to undermine authority, isn't it? And it's, it's why every despot in
5991520	5997200	history has killed the clown. Well, that's why we have to be so careful when any of our laws
5997200	6002240	start making comedians nervous. They're the ultimate canary in the coal mine.
6002960	6006960	Even more so than artists, I think. The artists are next, probably, but.
6006960	6011440	Absolutely. I mean, you, you'll know in Canada, Mike Ward was fined, I think $42,000
6012400	6016560	by the Quebec Human Rights Commission for a joke that he told, if you, and by the way, if you,
6016560	6020000	you know, this is not. Yes, and Montreal, of course, has one of the world's great comedy
6020000	6024400	festivals. And, and some of that humor, I've been to the comedy festival a couple of times,
6024400	6030320	and at midnight, you can go and hear particularly outrageous comedy, which I actually think it
6030320	6035280	was one of those where he said what he got fined for. And I, you know, I don't even know the
6035280	6039360	context because he said it in French for one thing. So I don't fully understand. But I read
6039360	6044000	the transcript and I spoke to him about it. And what was interesting is that he's not some,
6044000	6048240	you know, open Mike Act who's, who doesn't, hasn't been on the set. He's an established,
6048240	6053600	famous, successful comedian who was, who was fined for a joke that if you actually break
6053600	6058560	it down and analyze it, there's nothing remotely offensive about it. You know, I mean, it's
6058560	6063360	perfectly, I don't think comedy can, can exist without the potential to cause offense.
6063680	6070480	No, neither can truth. Right, quite. Comedy is almost always truth, almost always.
6070480	6074880	That comedian says something funny and it's true in a way that people didn't expect and they know it.
6076560	6082080	Well, it's also that, it's also that thing of, of, of, of teasing the boundaries of tolerance,
6082080	6086640	of, of, of almost, almost having that kind of cathartic effect, the way that the, the ancient
6086640	6090800	Greeks would watch a tragedy and, and hear about this dismemberment and all sorts of
6090800	6097200	vying to philosophically to purge themselves of the, of that evil that lay within. In a sense,
6097200	6102960	when you hear a comedian say something utterly outrageous, it can have that effect on you and
6102960	6107200	you laugh in spite of yourself. And then you laugh again, because you are saying to yourself,
6107200	6110080	why did I laugh at that? That makes me, I shouldn't have done that. So you're almost
6110080	6114240	laughing at your own response as well. It has a double effect. And we are really losing that.
6114240	6119520	I mean, I don't know how it is in Canada, but, but, but in the UK, a lot of this kind of
6119520	6123280	mistrust of comedy and mistrust of jokes and the idea that certain jokes
6123280	6127200	normalize hatred is coming from the comedians themselves. And a lot of comedians
6127920	6132080	take it on themselves to police other comedians' material and they get very angry
6132080	6137440	when people broach certain subjects. I consider it very, very unhealthy. And not all comedians,
6137440	6141040	by the way, I'm not saying that all comedians, I'm just saying, certainly the more establishment
6141040	6145520	comedians absolutely would fall into this category. And it's, it's really shocked me. This has been,
6146400	6150800	since I started to Tanya in particular, a lot of comedians have been very angry that I mocked
6150800	6156080	the social justice movement or, you know, that I, you know, which to me is a bit absurd, because,
6156080	6161680	you know, I spent years, three years writing, co-writing the Jonathan Pye character. And because
6161680	6168000	that predominantly mocked Trump and the right and conservatives. And, and, you know, it went,
6168000	6173440	those were the targets, that was okay. So I never got this kind of venom about, about that. But as
6173440	6178080	soon as I was mocking social justice ideology, which I perceived to be an extremely powerful
6178080	6182480	ideology, you know, this isn't, I don't think I'm punching down. I think I'm punching up at these,
6182480	6186800	at these, at these people who have captured these institutions and, and are ruthless, by the way,
6186800	6191120	absolutely ruthless and bullying. I think the social justice movement utterly legitimizes bullying.
6191120	6194880	And I don't like bullies. And I like to stand up to bullies. And that to Tanya is my attempt to
6194880	6199440	stand up against the bullies. But what they will do is misrepresent my intentions and will say,
6199520	6204000	oh, no, you just want to have a go at gay people or whatever, or have a go at minority groups. And,
6204000	6209520	and I've been very shocked by that, because that, that kind of response has even come from comedians.
6209520	6214640	And my view is that if you've got half a brain, you know, that's not what I'm doing. You, I mean,
6214640	6219680	you absolutely have to know that that's what not what I'm doing. And yet, maybe they do know, maybe
6219680	6224160	they, maybe this is a willfulness interpretation as a means to attack me, because I've, because I've
6224160	6228880	mocked the ideology I'm not meant to mock. But I tell you what, whenever there's, whenever there
6228960	6232640	are consequences for mocking someone, then I think that's the person you ought to be mocking, right?
6232640	6242640	I think that's a sign. Do you, would you, what effect has producing to Tanya had on your life?
6242640	6246880	And, and if you could go back and decide whether you were going to do it again, would you?
6248000	6252800	I mean, it must be shocking. I would think it's shocking to have, have seen what happened
6253600	6257920	to be at the center of what happened when you created that character. But I'd like to know.
6258720	6263200	I, well, for one thing, I didn't, yeah, I didn't expect the reaction that I got. Also,
6263200	6267920	you've got to remember that for a long time, the character I was anonymous. Because I, I,
6267920	6271520	part of the effects of the character was that people thought she was real. That was so
6271520	6277200	sort of integral to it. And then I was outed by a newspaper over here the week that her first
6277200	6282480	book came out. And that although that was very good for the books, it generated a lot of publicity,
6282480	6287120	because then the story became that I was the person behind the character. In effect, it had
6287120	6292080	an innovating impact on the, on the, on the character, because now what happens, people know
6292080	6295920	it's me behind the character, people. However, what I will say is even to this day, there's
6295920	6298640	always some people who fall for it whenever I tweet something, there's always some people
6298640	6303600	who fall for it. So it has that. So, so there's that. But then there's the impact on my personal
6303600	6311920	life. Well, I would do it again, because I feel very passionately that the, the, the movement
6311920	6316560	that I'm mocking, the ideology that I'm mocking is a dangerous one. And I feel very passionately
6316560	6324560	that it is divisive and damaging to society as damaging as any ideology can be. I think it has
6324560	6331840	the potential to go to those lengths. And, and so that I think I would almost be in dereliction if
6331840	6335840	I, if I didn't mock it, it would be, it would be, I tell you what it would be, it would be an act of
6335840	6340400	self censorship, if I didn't go after these targets. And that's by the way, how most comedians, I mean,
6340400	6343440	a lot of comedians think this stuff is ridiculous. They won't go near it because they know that if
6343440	6346960	they do, they won't get on the BBC and they won't get booked by certain clubs. So they just leave
6346960	6353520	it well alone. But I think I couldn't do, I could, I just, that's not in my nature. So I,
6354160	6360800	so I don't regret that. The fact that so many friends of mine, former friends on the company
6360800	6365680	circuit no longer talk to me, that's something which I suppose I could say is unfortunate.
6366320	6370560	On the other hand, how many times has that happened to you? How many friends do you think
6370560	6375840	you've lost? It's in double figures. It's certainly in double figures. And I think,
6378560	6382640	and it's not just Tanya, it's also partly, I suppose, my politics. It's also,
6386320	6390960	it's effectively being honest about what I think and saying opinions that might not be the establishment
6390960	6396560	of fashionable opinions. And it gets people very angry. I mean, one particular incident I could
6396560	6400240	think of was when I met for a drink with two friends, very old friends of mine, a married
6400240	6405920	couple. And he started screaming at me in the pub, I won't swear on your podcast, but calling me
6405920	6409440	an effing Nazi. And then another word, which I probably shouldn't say at this point.
6410960	6416720	But, and I thought he was joking at first. And we had this conversation. And it was true. He'd,
6416720	6422960	he'd completely bought into this fantasy of who I was. And, and there was no going back from that.
6424160	6427280	And I know it was fueled by alcohol, but no apology was forthcoming or no,
6428240	6432080	you know, it's, and then every now and then there'll be, I mean, it happened to be a couple of
6432080	6435920	months ago, we're a comedian I've known for many, many years from the circuit, suddenly sent me
6435920	6441200	this abusive message online on Twitter and started attacking me and saying I was, he said I was
6441760	6449920	funded by dark foreign powers or something utterly absurd, you know, and, and I thought, well, okay,
6449920	6454400	so this is now- Of course, that is what you'd say if you were funded by dark foreign powers.
6454480	6458240	Well, this is, this is the problem. Like I said, you know, I've said it before, like, if, you know,
6458240	6461520	if I am getting all this dark money, it must be very dark because I haven't seen any of it. It's
6461520	6466960	not, you know, that'd be great. Fine. But I'm not. And this idea that I'm this sort of, it's that
6466960	6471280	going right back to what you said at the start, like that I'm defending free speech, because I,
6471280	6475680	I, because I'm an evil person who wants to say evil things. And so there's all of that.
6476480	6480560	All that I'm mocking, I'm mocking minority groups through to Tanya, which is absolutely not what
6480560	6487520	I'm doing. It's the opposite. I'm mocking those very affluent and powerful people who very patronizingly
6487520	6491760	assume that they, they, they know what's best for minorities, you know, it's the opposite of what
6491760	6499920	people say it is. But these kind of experiences, on the one hand, I think it's a bit sad, isn't
6499920	6504560	it? Because there are people now, I've had to go through my phone and delete lots of numbers,
6504560	6509200	because I know we'll never talk again. But on the other hand, were they my friends to begin with?
6509200	6515200	I'm not so sure, you know, if they can, if they can suddenly become so bigoted. And that is the
6515200	6520080	word. Well, it's an indication of how profound the divide has started to become in our culture,
6520080	6525920	right? That I mean, 20 years ago, I never lost any friends because of my hypothetical political
6525920	6532560	opinions. But things have changed. You must have lost your, your case must be much more severe than
6532560	6538000	mine. You know, because you're so much more famous and so much more known has have lots of friends
6538000	6545920	turned on you. No, actually, not a lot. Some, there's some outstanding exceptions, although even
6545920	6550400	in those situations, I would say there was extenuating circumstances. No, I've been,
6550960	6557760	I've been really fortunate in that regard that my, my close circle of, of intimates my family and
6557760	6563040	my, my close friends have been staggeringly loyal to me under. Which is wonderful.
6563040	6567840	Severe distress. Yes. That's wonderful. So is it maybe the case? Does that tell us
6568480	6572400	that actually what it's really about is the fact that I was working in an industry,
6573040	6578480	which is, you know, the, the comedy industry is so on board with the woke ideology to such an
6578480	6584640	extent that in fact, so many of it's, it's so many comedians are now really just
6585200	6590400	advertised for that, for that ideology, maybe. Maybe. I mean, my professional colleagues certainly
6590400	6594080	haven't leapt to my defense. Well, that's, that's what I was going to ask, actually. Yes.
6594080	6599200	Surely. No, that's been, no, that's pretty much done with. I mean, I would say my name,
6599200	6604640	I've decided this recently because of the slurs that have been associated with me.
6605360	6612960	I can't in good conscience accept graduate students anymore. Because if they go out, you know,
6612960	6618800	you talked at the beginning about this register where that's been set up in Britain, where if you
6619680	6627360	are charged, accused of a non-crime hate act, it's recorded without a trial. I mean, I've been on
6627360	6634000	hiring committees many, many times. And especially in academia, there's an oversupply of highly
6634000	6640800	qualified people, of radical oversupply. And so if there's anything in your record at all that's
6640800	6647600	the least bit contentious, it's like you're, you're done. And so being my student, that's not
6647600	6653600	a little bit contentious. That's really, really contentious. And so it's now become impossible
6653600	6661360	for me to, to, to serve my proper function as a, as a scientist and as a university professor. So
6661360	6667200	that's, it's taking a lot of adjustment on my part to get accustomed to that. And I don't practice
6667200	6673280	clinically anymore as well. And there are a variety of reasons for that. But certainly the,
6674240	6682400	I've become very, very susceptible to attacks through the College of Psychologists,
6683040	6690080	the governing board. They can make the life of a practitioner brutally miserable with a single
6690080	6699520	letter. And that's very, very punishing. And it's also perhaps not necessarily good for my
6699520	6704560	potential clients to be associated with someone who's controversial. They already have enough
6704560	6710720	trouble. So although I've been fortunate on the family and friends front, the, on the professional
6710720	6718000	front, things have, have been, you know, more dismal. Isn't that just suggestive of the, of the,
6718000	6722720	the power of this movement and, and the effectiveness of cancel culture? In fact,
6723280	6728480	the way, the ease with which people can become stigmatized, you know, all it takes is a few
6728480	6733760	accusations of your far right or alt-right or whatever. And it's there, you know, any prospective
6733760	6738160	employer can Google that and it comes up and who's going to take the risk? You know, the accusation
6738160	6745040	is sufficient to damn you. And, and that's, that's what. Well, that you put the finger on the, on
6745040	6751760	the absolute catastrophe of the non-crime hate index. It's like, well, it's, it's a permanent
6751760	6757840	stain, especially in a, in a technological universe where nothing is ever forgotten,
6757840	6763360	no matter how long the lag. And it's worse because the government here feels no compunction
6763360	6770800	to address this or to no politician seem to has, well, I suppose they are, well, because the strategy
6770800	6774720	is that if you oppose hate speech laws, you're obviously a hateful person. Why else would you
6774720	6778160	oppose hate speech law? You know, it's the old thing and, and a politician doesn't want to stand
6778160	6782160	up in parliament to be the one who is seen to be siding with the evil guys, the bad guys.
6782160	6786720	So you have to make a very, very subtle argument to stand up against hate speech laws because
6786720	6792320	you're faced with the problem that there is such a thing as hate speech. Yeah. Obviously. So when
6792320	6798960	it's pernicious and terrible, it's like, okay. So you're arguing uphill. This is again why it's
6798960	6805040	such a bloody miracle that we ever had free speech to begin with. It's almost inconceivable to me that
6805040	6812560	we managed to generate the baseline presumption of innocence. That's a miracle. The fact that you
6812560	6818960	can go bankrupt and start again, that's a miracle. The idea that you ever had free speech and that
6818960	6825600	that was genuinely the case, that's a miracle. And none of this is given the appropriate respect
6825600	6831600	and awe that it deserves because it's so unlikely. It's hugely unlikely. I mean, I know in the book,
6831600	6836480	I talk about, I give a kind of very, very short history of free speech from the ancient Greeks
6836480	6842000	to today. And the point of that is to accentuate this point that actually the fact that we have it
6842000	6847360	is astonishing and unlikely, so unlikely. And all the more reason why we need to defend it,
6847360	6854000	we need to be really, really vigilant about any cracks that appear in this, because it will go
6854000	6858560	away very, very easily, you know, if we don't defend it. And it's hard, particularly when it comes to
6858560	6865040	the idea of, that's why I wrote a chapter on hate speech, because, and took the other side's view
6865040	6870000	seriously, because just trashing the opposing argument isn't going to help. We have to talk
6870000	6874880	about it and explain why it's important nevertheless. Well, for one thing, like you say,
6874880	6880800	hateful speech exists. Let's start from that point. Let's acknowledge that that hateful speech exists,
6880800	6886480	and it can be hurtful, and it can do damage. But then the alternative is a state that might,
6886480	6891440	in the future, be completely unscrupulous, that is going to decide for you what you can say. And
6891440	6895840	those are the things that we have to tackle. And the other key thing is that no one knows how to
6895840	6901360	define hate speech. You know, UNESCO, the European Court of Human Rights, they've all agreed,
6901360	6905760	there's no way to define hate speech. Every European country that has hate speech laws
6905760	6910720	has different hate speech laws, different definitions, subjective, abstract concepts,
6910720	6915680	such as hate, such as offence, such as a perception, you know, and these are on the
6915680	6918720	statute books, and you don't want this stuff on the statute books, because it's all very well.
6918720	6923120	I mean, I know the, we talked about the SMP and their hate crime bill, the defense I'm always
6923120	6928400	running into, is people are saying, yes, okay, technically, someone could be arrested and imprisoned
6928400	6934000	for saying some, an offensive joke, technically, yes. But no one in their right mind, no jury,
6934000	6940880	no judge is going to, we've got common sense, it's okay. Well, that's so myopic. I mean,
6940880	6944320	what, because you don't know who's going to be in charge in 10 years time. You don't know who
6944320	6948720	that judge is going to be. How can you possibly just... You can be certain that someone will be
6948720	6955920	in charge that doesn't approve of you and that you don't approve of, that will, that will certainly
6955920	6963600	happen. You don't want vague, vague wording on the statute books. It's going to be exploited
6963600	6967280	at some point, even though, even if it's not today, there's absolutely no way that you can
6967280	6973360	guarantee it against future, against the future abuses of that. And I don't, it is, as you say,
6973360	6980400	it's a certainty. So I think it's actually one of the most important arguments that we should make
6981760	6986560	and that free speech needs to be defended in every successive generation. It's not something that
6987440	6991600	you know this, you get it and then it's there forever. No, that's not true. There's something
6991600	6996080	about human nature. There's something about people in power. There's something about the way that we
6996080	7005280	are that it will collapse. It's an edifice that is not secure at any given time. But it's hard.
7005280	7009600	It's that thing of being smeared. The risk is you're going to be smeared. You're going to be
7009600	7013360	associated with the worst possible kinds of people because, of course, it's only really
7013360	7016960	controversial speech that ever requires protection. And people are going to say,
7017760	7022640	well, then you must support what these awful people are saying. And it's hard to make the case.
7022640	7026480	But it's a case that nonetheless has to be made. And particularly by politicians,
7026480	7031440	I've been incredibly disappointed by the way in which politicians in this country have not
7032080	7038000	made any kind of effort to, if anything, as from what I can see, there are moves even in the
7038000	7040880	English parliament to push through further hate speech laws. We should be repealing them,
7040880	7044400	not pushing for them. But no one wants to have the argument. No one wants to be tainted.
7045120	7048800	Yeah, well, they get identified one by one and taken out. That's what happens.
7049520	7053840	Where you get put on a list. This is it. The identitarian left, if that's what we're going
7053840	7056880	to call them. I don't know what to call them. That's the problem. They're very clever about
7056880	7062160	evading even a label. But they like making their lists. They like observing and saying,
7062160	7070160	you know, you are problematic. You have sinned. And now they have an electronic trail.
7071440	7074800	These are the people that absolutely love going through all of your old tweets and messages
7075440	7079920	and anything they can find. And of course, the point about that is you can do that to anyone.
7079920	7083920	There is no one alive who, if you had complete unfettered access to everything they've ever
7083920	7087600	written online or in their emails or text messages, that you couldn't construct a
7087600	7091680	case to dam someone. That's actually one of the things that's more or less saved me.
7092880	7098000	Is that right? Well, by the time I made my political statement, which was a philosophical
7098000	7103600	statement or even a spiritual statement, not a political statement, I already had 200 hours of
7103600	7109440	lectures online. And so essentially everything I'd ever said to students was recorded. And
7111360	7116320	it wasn't possible to pull out a smoking pistol. This was very smart. And also, I mean,
7116320	7121680	but this is why it's also astonishing. I find it unendingly astonishing the way you are mischaracterized
7121680	7126240	because it's all there. Everything you think is out in the open. You've been very, very,
7126240	7131360	very clear and explicit about your point of view. And so when they try and demonize you and turn
7131360	7134560	you into this thing, people can check and they'll realize that you're there. I think what they're
7134560	7140000	doing is they're relying on the reputational damage being a kind of barrier to people even
7140000	7145040	investigating who you really are. Yeah, well, to some degree, that that works. But it doesn't
7145040	7151200	really work because what genuine generally happens is that, you know, for every person who
7151200	7157120	wouldn't open a lecture because of my reputation, there's three or four who do because they're
7157120	7163920	curious. And then it has an even more perverse effect on, in some cases, on the true believers
7163920	7170800	because they're primed to find anything I said offensive, but that doesn't happen,
7170800	7174960	or maybe they even find it useful. And then that's not good at all. It's like, well,
7176000	7180560	it's not interesting when you meet the people, when you get into conversation with people and
7180560	7185280	you can see that you're not what they thought you were. And they don't know quite what to do with
7185280	7191760	that. And that to me is why another reason why we need more speech, not less, we need to have
7191760	7196160	the conversation so that people can be disabused of the fantasies that they've been wallowing in.
7196880	7201840	But I do very much enjoy that when people expect one thing and then they actually
7203600	7208400	speak to me and they don't see that, that there's no evidence of it because it doesn't exist.
7208400	7212640	Yeah, well, it's interesting to watch that unfold in the public domain too. I mentioned those two
7212640	7219520	interviews, the Channel 4 interview that is being viral and the interview by Helen Lewis at GQ.
7222080	7226320	Those interviews basically consist of nothing but
7229520	7234000	the attempt by the interlocutor to have a conversation with the person that exists in
7234000	7236240	their imagination. Right, but what's the point of that?
7236240	7240240	There's almost no relationship to me at all. That was particularly the case with
7241120	7247600	Cathy Newman and was less so with Helen Lewis, but that was still essentially the issue.
7248160	7252160	It's quite reassuring, though, isn't it, that once it's out there, people can see through it?
7252880	7261200	It's very reassuring. What saved me, and this has given me an endless supply of hope, I would say,
7261200	7267840	is that all I've ever had to do is just show everything. It's like, here's the situation,
7267840	7278720	no edits. This is what happened, and every time so far, I haven't been fatally damaged.
7280000	7285840	Yeah, I mean, one of the things I've learned most, I think, since Tatania kicked off and
7286640	7293200	it became a known thing, is I've learned simply never to trust the perception of someone as
7294160	7301200	as constructed in the media or online. It's never the same person. I've ended up
7302400	7305680	coming from the background I did. Most of my friends were always on the left. I didn't really
7305680	7309760	know conservative people, and now I have a lot of friends who are conservatives,
7310640	7315360	and they're just not this villain that they were made out to be, and even some famous
7315360	7318880	conservatives who people have said they're absolute monsters, they're evil, they want to eat babies,
7318960	7323120	basically, or the equivalent, and you get to know them, and you realize, oh my goodness,
7323120	7331040	the perception is so far removed from the reality that even I once had bought into it myself,
7331040	7335040	because everyone's telling you this. Yeah, the same thing. I certainly had that experience
7335040	7340800	repeatedly, repeatedly. I never trust it now. Whenever I hear the way people talk about people
7340800	7345520	online, I never trust it. Unless I know someone personally, I'm never going to trust that again.
7345920	7354080	I think that's an important lesson for me. What's next for you? Also, how do you make a living?
7354080	7358560	You can't make a living as Detainee McGrath. I mean, you're locked down still, so it's
7358560	7364880	got to be hard being a comedian. Right. Well, comedy came to an end. I did a
7364880	7373600	tour, I did a stand-up comedy tour in early 2019, and that was really the last big thing I did,
7373600	7379280	because as soon as I was about to do some more live performances, the lockdown came, and it's
7379280	7382960	the same. I'm not complaining, because absolutely every live performer has the identical experience,
7382960	7389600	and we've all, you know, I'm not in a position to complain. Yeah, it's a very good question.
7389600	7394720	I like it, because it's also very direct. How do I make my money? Well, I write articles for
7394720	7402960	various publications. There's the Titania books have kept me going. I obviously used to work on
7402960	7407680	the Jonathan Pye character. We had a couple of television shows and live tours. Those were
7407680	7411600	particularly lucrative. And for a long time, I did just make my money as a stand-up comic,
7411600	7417600	so literally just the money I would make from the circuit. Now, I've just got a job with,
7418640	7426560	well, it's, you know, I gave up being a full-time teacher for this, and I was on a regular wage.
7426560	7433760	It was a good salary, and I left it at great risk, you know, because I don't come from a wealthy
7433760	7440400	family. I don't have the means to support myself without this kind of stuff. So I went, well,
7440400	7445040	I actually went part-time first and was on the stand-up circuit. And then I started earning
7445040	7450960	enough from the stand-up to get by. And so I went full-time stand-up, but I was really,
7450960	7456000	I was genuinely struggling financially for a long time. And then Jonathan Pye happened,
7456000	7460880	which was very successful, particularly because we had a big viral hit around the time of the
7460880	7464560	Donald Trump election, which actually went viral in America as well. And that really helped
7464560	7467680	broaden the character. And then we did live tours and all the rest of it. We played the
7467680	7473200	London Palladium and the Hammersmith Apollo. And so it was a big thing for me. And then Tatania
7473200	7478080	happened, and the book did very well, and the second book did well. And how many copies do you,
7478080	7481280	you don't have to tell me, obviously, but how many copies? I don't know. Actually, the truth is,
7481280	7485200	I don't know. That's something I should ask at some point. It's the sort of thing I don't look
7485200	7491520	into. You know, I got a royalty check the other day, and I thought, I thought it was done. And
7491520	7495600	actually, this was quite a lot of money. I thought, okay, that's good. This is something that can
7495600	7502240	keep me going. But I've also just got a new job as a broadcaster on a new channel called GB News
7502240	7511600	in the UK. And that will be a pretty full-time, full-on presenter job. But what's good about
7511600	7516400	that job is, you know, I think we have a real problem with the news media in this country is
7516400	7520800	that we don't have enough diversity of thought and the conversations that we ought to be having.
7520800	7524880	This gives me an opportunity to do that. So it's very much related to the work I've been doing.
7524880	7531200	But in addition, I'm going to continue with my comedy work and Tatania. We're doing some live
7531200	7536400	shows with Tatania, played by an actress. We did that just before the lockdown. We had to postpone
7536400	7543280	the tour. Now we're going to do another one. So I will, yeah, a lot of people get very scared by
7544080	7546960	making a living as a creative person because you're always on the line.
7546960	7549840	As they should be. Jesus, it's a tough way to make a living, man.
7549840	7554720	It really, I mean, you're taking a massive risk. And most creatives I know are very,
7554720	7557840	very poor. You know, it's simply not, and most have other jobs, you know.
7557840	7561520	Yeah, there's a tiny fraction that are hyper-rich and everyone else starves.
7561520	7566000	Virtually no one. And I consider myself extremely fortunate to be able to do this full,
7566000	7570480	the stuff I love, full-time. Because for most of my adult career, I couldn't.
7570480	7575120	And I was, you know, I had to have a full-time job and as well as go out in the evenings
7575120	7582960	and do all of this stuff. And so it's a real, you have to really commit. And you also have to be
7583520	7587920	aware in the back of your mind of the likelihood of failure. That's, you know,
7587920	7593200	that's the other thing that you have to be fully aware of. And I'm by no means taken for granted.
7593200	7598880	You know, I think I'm, you know, it's the stuff I've done comedy into Tanya and the book I've
7598880	7605120	just written is that none of this stuff would make me rich. It would keep me going. The new job
7605120	7609040	I've got is going to be a more regular income, which is something I miss. I haven't had this
7609040	7612560	since I was a teacher. I missed that. You know, I missed routine and all the rest of it.
7613440	7618560	Yeah, well, another complicating factor is not only if you're trying to exist creatively,
7618560	7626480	not only is it a very high-risk proposition financially, but you lack that psychological
7627520	7633040	comfort that comes from routine, which, you know, people, artistic people often
7633040	7639520	are hypercritical of routine, but God, man, routine keeps you sane and trying to invent
7639520	7644880	yourself every day. That's not for the faint hearted. I've seen very few people manage that
7644880	7651920	successfully across decades. No, absolutely. And I think particularly in comedy, you know,
7651920	7655360	because you have to work for about three or four years on the circuit without getting paid anything.
7655360	7658400	In fact, you're losing money because you're paying for your travel expenses and then you get
7658400	7663360	somewhere and you don't get paid for it. And this is why a lot, you'll find a lot of comedians,
7663360	7669120	particularly in the UK, are from quite wealthy backgrounds or privately educated because they
7669120	7672640	have rich parents who can help them out, put them up in a flat and they don't have to work
7672640	7677600	during the day. And they escalate much quicker through the ranks. But if you come from my sort
7677600	7682080	of background, you can't do that. You have to have the job. And then you have to, it's like
7682080	7687760	having two jobs. And so you have to really care about it. I mean, my advice is always that I do
7687760	7694400	believe, although it comes with that insecurity, if it is a vocation for you, you have to do it.
7694400	7699200	I mean, for me, I couldn't have done anything. It is a genuine vocation for me, even if I
7699200	7704640	were making no money whatsoever, out of comedy or writing or the rest, I would still be doing it
7704640	7709360	because I would feel unfulfilled if I were not doing it. I think there's something also quite,
7709360	7713280	I mean, I take your point about the practicalities of living and the business of living. But my
7713280	7717760	God, I think depriving yourself of your vocation can be so soul destroying.
7717760	7723040	No, it is. Well, I've spent a lot of time studying creativity scientifically. And
7723760	7730640	the first thing that's useful to note is that creativity is not common. I mean, everyone
7730640	7737440	isn't creative. That's wrong. Some people are very creative. A minority of people are very creative.
7737440	7742960	And I mean, it's a continuum, but you don't get, you know, you don't get creativity till you get
7742960	7747920	out to the point where what you're doing is original. And that's very difficult. So it's a minority
7748480	7752880	proposition. And then of those original people, there's only a tiny fraction that can make a
7752880	7757680	successful financial go of it because it's just you have to be creative. Plus, you have to have
7757680	7762720	some sense for marketing and sales and business. And you have to be reasonably emotionally stable
7762720	7770640	and etc. etc. It's very, very difficult. But if you are creative by temperament, well, that's you.
7771760	7777760	To not do that is to not be you. It's like asking an extroverted person not to be around people
7777760	7783120	or an agreeable person not to engage in intimate relationships or a conscientious person not to
7783120	7788320	be driven by duty. It's like, that's what you're like. And so yeah, you're stuck with it. It's a
7788320	7795280	double edged sword creativity. It's vital. It's entrancing. It's necessary. It's transformative.
7795280	7802560	It's disruptive. But it's a high risk, high risk, high return game. And the probability of failure is
7803280	7808640	overwhelmingly high. Even if you're an entrepreneur and you know, more practically oriented in your
7808640	7813520	creativity, the probability that you'll make money from your innovation or your invention
7813520	7819280	rather than other people is very, very low. But you need to find a way. I mean, it's also very
7819280	7823360	difficult if you're a creative person to a lot of creative people don't think in practical terms.
7823360	7827840	They don't think in terms of money. Actually, they're hopeless. A lot of them might I know are
7827840	7832240	hopeless. They also tend to be casually contemptuous of that to regard as practical
7832240	7837040	concerns is selling out. It's like, you should be bloody happy if you have the opportunity to sell
7837040	7842960	out. So I think that the ideal is to find a way to pursue your vocation, but have one eye on the
7842960	7850320	reality that you will have to earn money somewhere or another. I mean, yes, I think it's, that's why
7850320	7854560	I think I'm lucky. And so far as with Titania, I hit on something that had commercial viability,
7854560	7859280	but it was very true to what I desperately wanted to do. And I think that's so rare. I think some
7859280	7862480	of the stuff I've written, some of the plays I've written, for instance, I don't think would have
7862480	7867280	any commercial success whatsoever. But I wrote them because I needed to write them. And some of
7867280	7872000	them didn't even get on. And maybe one day they will. And that would be great. But what you have
7872000	7879600	to accomplish though, right? You have to have your creative endeavor aligned with market demand at
7879600	7885840	exactly that time. It's impossible. It's very, very unlikely. Actually, that's why I always say,
7886000	7891440	don't attempt to anticipate the zeitgeist because you won't. Like the best thing an artist can do
7891440	7897120	is do what they believe and hope because a lot of it is luck. You know what I mean?
7897120	7901040	I mean, there's actually, there's a technical literature on that too. I mean, what essentially
7901040	7905840	what you do is continue to produce ideas. And it's a Darwinian competition. Essentially,
7905840	7911120	they're like life forms, these ideas. And now and then one will find a niche that it can thrive in.
7911840	7918400	But the best way to maximize your chance is that that niche will manifest itself is to be,
7919760	7925680	is to overproduce. Because look, for I'll give you an example, I answered a bunch of questions on
7925680	7931200	Quora. So that's a website where anybody can ask any questions and anybody can answer. I answered
7931200	7936560	about 50 when I was playing with Quora. And one of them was a list of everything people should know,
7936560	7940000	of things people should know in their life. And I derived my books out of that list.
7941120	7947200	It was disproportionately successful. Most of the answers I generated got virtually no views,
7947200	7951440	but it got, it must be hundreds of thousands now. But even before I wrote the books, it was tens of
7951440	7959360	thousands. But had I not written 50, I wouldn't have got that one. The other 49 failures, so to
7959360	7966400	speak, were the answers weren't necessarily worse. They just didn't hit the zeitgeist,
7967040	7972000	like that answer did. And I think that's a great piece of advice. Overproduction, because
7972000	7976400	it's the same with the Beatles. They look like an overnight success. It's because they've been
7976400	7984160	playing endlessly in those dingy clubs in Europe. Before it happened, you produce as much as you
7984160	7990000	can. They say it takes 10 years to become an overnight success. That's it. Most of the things
7990000	7995840	I've written have done nothing and gone nowhere and had no success whatsoever. But the one thing,
7995840	8000560	occasionally when it hits, that's what sustains all the rest of it. And it's also why creativity
8001360	8005440	continues to be selected, let's say, from a biological perspective. It's like, that's why
8005440	8010560	I said it was a high risk, high return game. Almost everything you do creatively will fail.
8011200	8017200	But now and then, you're disproportionately successful. And so that keeps the whole game going.
8017760	8021440	You didn't have any sense, did you, that when you put the lectures on YouTube that it would
8021440	8029360	explode in this way? I mean, not in this way. That was completely, I'm still shocked constantly
8029360	8035360	by my life. I'm shocked out of sanity by my life. I just can't. This is why I asked you
8035360	8041840	about Titania. You get at the center of a whirlwind like that. And there's something very
8043280	8049280	surreal about it. And I keep getting hit by surreal things. And it's very hard to wrap
8049280	8057120	my head around it. Like this Red Skull episode was just one of many equally surreal occurrences.
8057120	8066160	But no, I had no idea. I knew I was working on something important back when I was in my 20s,
8066160	8071120	when I wrote my first book. And it was out of that, that all my lectures came. I spent 15 years
8071120	8076480	working on that book. And I worked on it about three hours a day. And so I thought about it
8076480	8082880	all the time. And so I knew there was something to it, not necessarily because they were my ideas,
8082880	8088160	but because of the people who I had read and delved into while I was writing the book. I knew
8088160	8094480	the ideas were significant. And I could see the effect of the ideas when I was lecturing on my
8094480	8101520	students. So I had some sense that there was something vital, that I was involved in something
8101520	8106800	vital. But sure. But had you uploaded those videos a couple of years before or a couple of years
8106800	8110560	later, you probably would have missed the zeitgeist and nothing would have happened. I mean, it
8110560	8114560	doesn't matter. I always think with any kind of creative endeavor or intellectual endeavor, it
8114560	8119360	doesn't matter how good you are in a sense, it has to be good. And the timing has to be right.
8119360	8123440	And like you say, if you just keep, I think persistence is it, if you just keep doing it,
8123440	8129520	not only does your craft get better and you are, if it does hit, you're in a position to be able to
8129520	8135520	no doubt. Look, if you, if you, okay, so in scientific literature, the hallmark of impact
8135520	8141040	is citations. And so if your work is cited, it means that someone who's written another scientific
8141040	8147760	article makes reference to something you wrote. And that's all tracked and it's used for promotions
8147760	8154160	and it's used to judge scientific merit. It's, it's, it's its own science citation tracking.
8154400	8162560	A very small number of your published papers accrue most of the citations. So that's the first
8162560	8167280	thing. So what that means is the more papers you publish, the more likely it is that one of them
8167280	8172720	will become highly cited. And my highly cited papers aren't necessarily the ones that I thought
8172720	8181920	would be most impactful. So you, but the other piece of information from literature on creativity
8181920	8188160	is that the best predictor of quality, and so you could index quality by impact, let's say,
8188160	8194000	or by citations is quantity. Yeah, it's not a great predictor, but it's the best one. And so
8194720	8198880	this is a good advice for everyone out there who's a musician or an artist. It's like,
8199760	8204000	produce, produce, produce, produce as much as you can, because you do get better at it, right?
8204960	8210080	You absolutely do. And, and so there's that, but there's also, I think the other important thing
8210080	8215840	is to, to actually be true to yourself in your artistic endeavors, insofar as don't be trying
8215840	8219920	to anticipate the desire, guys, don't be trying to anticipate what other people are doing. My big
8219920	8225040	concern in the current climate that we live in is that a lot of artists are choosing to self-censor,
8225040	8231600	because the penalty for risk taking has got too high. You know, you can be completely, I mean,
8231600	8235360	if I think of an example like- Well, think about what kind of catastrophe that is, because we've
8235360	8240800	already discussed the fact that the impediments to creativity are almost insurmountable. And so
8240800	8245440	then you add an additional one, which is self-censorship because of social pressure. It's like,
8245440	8250000	you just decimate the creative enterprise by doing that. We wouldn't have anything. We, we,
8250000	8253680	the western canon would be decimated. It's ridiculous. I mean, an example I often think of
8253680	8258000	is, is one of my favorite playwrights is Edward Albee. And when he came to write his play, The
8258000	8261600	Goat, which was a very controversial play, because it was about a man having an affair,
8261600	8265680	a sexual affair with a goat behind his wife's back. And obviously that doesn't sound palatable.
8265680	8270720	Well, at least he went behind his wife's back. Exactly. At least it wasn't sort of an open,
8270720	8275920	sort of paganistic thing, absolutely. But I mean, it's, it's a shocking play and it's meant to be.
8275920	8283680	It's about where our lines of tolerance are, where they lie and why. And all of his friends told him,
8283680	8287840	don't do this. You've got a valuable career, an incredible reputation. You're turning 80. You're
8288080	8291120	80. He was roughly 80 years old when this play came out. And they said, you're just going to
8291120	8296480	scupper everything. And he said that when he got that response, that's the reason he did it.
8296480	8300560	He went out there and he put the play on. And it turned out to be a huge success. It won,
8300560	8304400	I think, the Tony Award for best play. It was critically and commercially successful. It was
8304400	8310160	absolutely massive. So it just goes to show, I think, to an extent, I mean, I'm not saying disregard
8310720	8315040	feedback from other creative people or people who have suggestion. What I am saying is if you're
8315040	8321280	true to your muse, whatever that that is, the rewards will come, actually, or they are more
8321280	8326720	likely to come. Okay, so that brings us back to free speech too, because, you know, the problem
8326720	8331520	with laws that abridge free speech is they abridge creative endeavor. And that's a terrible thing,
8331520	8337760	because it's the source of endless renewal. And it's the thing that fixes corrupt structures. And
8337760	8344240	so to, to take aim at that is to take aim at the very process that would rescue you from the conundrum
8345120	8351680	you are pretending to be obsessed by. I mean, has there been any innovation, not just in artistic
8351680	8356400	terms, but in scientific terms, without the risk of offense without, you know, I mentioned the
8356400	8361840	example of Galileo in the book, because, you know, he wasn't, he caused a great deal of offense.
8361840	8368640	Oh hell, Darwin offended himself so badly that he was sick. He was sick for like a decade because
8368640	8373440	of the implications of what he'd thought up, which were thoroughly offensive to himself.
8374320	8379360	As they would be, you know, in with his belief system at the time. And, but, but that's, that's
8379360	8386400	the, we can see in hindsight, what we would have lost if people weren't willing to risk offending
8386400	8389680	others. In fact, even what you said to Kathy Newman in that interview about your risking
8389680	8394000	being offensive by disagreeing with me now in this way, like, it's how it's important to risk
8394000	8399920	offending people. It's because otherwise you just end up in this kind of, you know, this hive mind
8399920	8406880	and, and, and for the arts, it becomes utterly stultified. It becomes so boring when, when
8406880	8412320	everything is predictable and everything is in line with a viewpoint and no one wants to, you
8412320	8416640	know, the art is the best way that we interrogate the complexities of humanity. It's, it's, it's,
8417680	8422560	I love what sometimes what the filmmaker Lars von Trier, he said in an interview once that
8422560	8426480	sometimes when he's making a film, he will take an indefensible moral position
8426480	8430320	and attempt to defend it through the film, which I think is such a fascinating idea.
8430320	8434080	Dostoevsky did that all the time in his great novels and so brilliant. I mean,
8434800	8440880	that's what, what made Dostoevsky so staggeringly brilliant was he would take positions that he,
8441680	8448080	that he despised with all his soul and make the people putting those beliefs forward that
8448080	8451360	strongest characters in the book. I mean, he's so brave.
8451920	8455760	It's the best thing to do. It's, it's, I wrote a play once where I completely,
8455760	8461360	it was a one man play where I completely tried to embody the kind of person I despise. It was
8461360	8467920	someone who enjoyed relished watching via acts of violence and he would take a scour the internet
8467920	8472080	for clips of real life violence. And it's something I can, you know, whenever I've had that, whenever
8472080	8476320	someone's tried to show me a beheading or something, I know I never want to see that kind of thing.
8476320	8479600	I know I never want that in my head. And so I wanted to write a character
8479600	8484640	who relished it. But from a position, from a non-judgmental position, I've never put that
8484640	8489520	play on. I've written it's done. But the act of doing it was so incredibly liberating and
8489520	8494160	interesting. And the idea that you can, you know, you keep hearing this all the time,
8495200	8500640	you know, whenever a new film or a play comes out of a book, is this sending the right message?
8500640	8505440	David Lynch's last series, the latest Twin Peaks series was criticized, I read a review saying,
8505440	8509680	well, there's violence against women in this, and he needs to be called out for this. Well,
8509680	8513840	representing violence against women isn't an endorsement of violence against women.
8513840	8516800	You know, maybe that's what the character does, and maybe we're supposed to hate him for it or
8516800	8521600	whatever, you know, and or if you read an autobiography of a complete reprobate,
8521600	8525600	there can be something really interesting about that. And imagine all of this gone,
8525600	8531040	all of this potential. But that is the end point of that's why I believe that this this current
8531040	8536800	social justice ideology is anti art. I think it's it's opposed to the the artistic spirit,
8536800	8542000	quite quite fundamentally opposed to it, which is why I feel we must push back against it.
8543360	8548560	So that's a great place to end. No, no, that's great. That's great. Well, thanks a lot.
8549760	8554800	Yeah, much appreciated. It was a pleasure. And the time flew by, which is a good marker of a
8555360	8561600	engaging exchange of free speech, let's say. Absolutely. Thanks so much for having me, Jordan.
8561600	8570720	My pleasure. Good luck. Thank you.
