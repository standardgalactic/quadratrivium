1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
Good evening and welcome to Dr. Jordan B. Peterson's We Who

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,680
Wrestle With God Tour.

3
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,680
All these great bands, and here you are tonight.

4
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,180
Well, thank you very much for coming.

5
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,880
Let me tell you what's going to happen tonight.

6
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,480
I'm going to share my thoughts with you.

7
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,280
For 70 minutes, thereabouts.

8
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,380
Then I have a special guest here,

9
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,580
Konstantin Kizin, who runs a podcast.

10
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,980
Good. Well, you should know about him.

11
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,480
Definitely crazy Russian from the UK.

12
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:17,980
A real voice of reason for our fellow Westerners in the UK.

13
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:24,480
Konstantin is going to come out on stage and torture me about what I said, I hope.

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,780
Well, what I'm hoping, Konstantin is a very clear thinker, very witty man.

15
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,480
He's got a very sharp mind.

16
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,380
He's critically oriented in the best possible way.

17
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,980
A good critical mind separates the wheat from the chaff, right?

18
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:44,280
Because to be property critical isn't to hurt or destroy with criticism.

19
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,280
It's to separate what's truly valuable from what isn't valuable,

20
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,380
so that you have solid ground to stand on.

21
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,580
And, you know, one of the things that I strive to do in my whole academic career

22
00:01:54,580 --> 00:02:01,880
is to move closer and closer to believing and stating and writing things

23
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,080
that I can't, I can't move.

24
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:17,580
And you do that yourself by subjecting your own presumptions to critical analysis.

25
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,880
You do that so that you think through what you're doing

26
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,680
so that you don't act out your stupid ideas in the world and die.

27
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,980
And that's the purpose of thinking, right?

28
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:35,580
Seriously, the purpose of thinking is to have your stupid ideas die instead of you.

29
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,580
And that's part of the reason why your enemy can be your best friend.

30
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,780
Because if someone can take out something you think

31
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,180
because they can show you how it's erroneous and counterproductive

32
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,780
and then you don't have to go through all the trouble of learning that stupidly in the world,

33
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,580
that's a fine gift.

34
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:58,880
And so, I'm hoping that Constantine can stand in for the audience,

35
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,080
for the critical and skeptical audience.

36
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,680
We're talking about very difficult issues.

37
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:11,680
It's highly likely that I could formulate what I'm stating more clearly and precisely.

38
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:19,280
And so, Constantine will come out and we'll discuss what was presented tonight

39
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,080
and then we'll turn to the questions that you've kindly delivered and discussed those.

40
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,780
And then we'll reintroduce the band and that should do for the evening.

41
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,480
And so, that's the plan.

42
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,180
And so, away we go.

43
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,580
I'm very much looking forward to this.

44
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:53,380
So, the first thing we're going to talk about is we're going to talk about stories and set the stage.

45
00:03:53,380 --> 00:04:03,880
I think we're at a crucial inflection point in the world, culturally and philosophically.

46
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,880
I think we're on the dawn of a new set of realizations,

47
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,880
a new set of realizations that will return us to our fundamentals.

48
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,780
I think the reason that we have a culture war raging in the West,

49
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,080
why there's so much instability,

50
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:25,480
is because something new is struggling to be born or reborn.

51
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,680
And I want to explain the reason for that first.

52
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:37,680
And the reason is that the enlightenment view of the world,

53
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,480
which has guided our technological and scientific endeavor, our conceptual endeavor,

54
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:49,580
our philosophical endeavor for a few hundred years,

55
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,180
is there's something about it that's wrong, like deeply wrong.

56
00:04:53,180 --> 00:05:00,980
And that error is making itself manifest in the scientific community,

57
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:07,280
because I would say now that scientists themselves from a multitude of different disciplines

58
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:14,280
understand that the idea that we see the world as a place of facts,

59
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,780
or that we see the world as rational creatures,

60
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,880
or that you can even see the world that way is wrong.

61
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,680
And I believe that it's been demonstrated to be wrong.

62
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,580
This isn't a matter of mere philosophical opinion anymore,

63
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,780
although it's also that.

64
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:39,180
One example, for example, is that the newest artificial intelligence systems

65
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,480
that we've designed, the large language models that have burst onto the stage

66
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:49,080
in the last year, or thereabouts, ChatGPT, the catastrophic Gemini

67
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:55,280
that Google so foolishly launched, Elon Musk's GROC,

68
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,680
these systems are trained like human beings are trained.

69
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,480
They have a name, they have a purpose.

70
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,780
They were trained with reward and punishment, so to speak,

71
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,180
their approximations to a target.

72
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,480
They see the world through a structure of value

73
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,780
that they have absorbed from human beings

74
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:21,980
to make the world's smartest linguistic machines.

75
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,880
We had to inculcate in them a structure of value.

76
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:31,880
Okay, and so, and we produced machines now that can engage in discourse,

77
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,280
that can use language in a way that's virtually indistinguishable from the human,

78
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,880
and it's going to become radically indistinguishable from the human very, very rapidly.

79
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,480
And they're not programmed like lists of rules.

80
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,680
They're not programmed like ordinary thinking machines.

81
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,880
They're programmed the same way that human beings learn.

82
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,580
They're programmed with aim.

83
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:01,180
They have an ethos and an ethic.

84
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:08,580
We can't orient ourselves in the world with the facts.

85
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:13,780
We can't follow the science because science isn't a leader.

86
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,180
Science doesn't establish our aims.

87
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,380
Our aims are established using mechanisms of perception and emotion

88
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,080
and thought that aren't in themselves scientific.

89
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,180
We're aiming at something.

90
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:36,280
Why can't we orient ourselves in the world with the facts?

91
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,280
Well, the simplest explanation for that is that

92
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,080
there are too many facts.

93
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,980
There's as many facts as there are phenomena.

94
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:55,580
More, actually, there's as many facts as there are possible combinations of phenomena.

95
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,880
You drown in the facts.

96
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,880
When you're confused in your own life and things are chaotic and you're anxious,

97
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:09,180
it's because a plethora of possibilities is making itself manifest in front of you

98
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,280
and you don't know which way to turn.

99
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,580
You don't have a clear direction.

100
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,580
You don't have a clear aim.

101
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,980
There's no way of simplifying the world so that you can act in it.

102
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,080
We know, for example, that to perceive the world,

103
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:27,680
you have to obliterate from your consciousness almost everything that you could see

104
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,480
because otherwise you're overwhelmed.

105
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:37,580
We know even that the hallucinogens who are being studied with increasing intensity

106
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:46,180
in recent years interfere with your normal perception such that they bring to consciousness

107
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:51,180
a plethora of things that under normal circumstances you ignore.

108
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:58,580
And the consequence of that is influx of a sense of overwhelming significance and meaning,

109
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:05,020
but at the same time a kind of paralysis of action because when everything becomes

110
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,620
infinitely meaningful, there's no straightforward way of moving forward.

111
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,920
When you're in a restaurant with someone on a first date

112
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,020
and you're focusing on the conversation and actions of your date,

113
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:24,320
in a sea of competing conversations,

114
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,320
you zero out everything that you could be attending to in every other table,

115
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,220
all the competing thoughts in your imagination,

116
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:40,020
all the things you could be bringing to mind to zero in with like laser pinpoint accuracy

117
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:44,020
on what it is that your partner in conversation is doing.

118
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,220
And you do that in the world all the time.

119
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:51,220
You make one thing at a time of pinnacle importance

120
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:57,120
and you arrange everything else in the world at every moment that you perceive

121
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,420
around that thing that you've made of pinnacle importance.

122
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,820
That's how you see the world and I don't mean think about the world.

123
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,820
This is under thought.

124
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,220
It's more profound.

125
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,520
It's what you do when you actually see.

126
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:24,920
If I decide to do something straightforward like walk from here to the stairs on the stage

127
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:31,520
and I set my aim, I don't perceive any of you in consequence

128
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:38,220
because the fact of your existence is irrelevant to my purpose and you're gone.

129
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:46,820
None of the facts of the stage that I could attend to are relevant and perceptible anymore

130
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:57,320
except in so far as their pathways or facilitators or obstacles to my journey forward.

131
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:03,020
If I'm looking to the stairs, I see the chairs but not as places to sit.

132
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:09,220
I see them as obstacles that I have to circumvent in order to attain my aim.

133
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:16,320
Everything that you see in the world makes itself manifest in accordance with your aim.

134
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:25,220
And that's a radically, revolutionarily different way of conceptualizing the world than the notion

135
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:32,020
that you take the facts and you sort them despite their infinite number

136
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:37,420
and calculate your way with the facts rationally forward.

137
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,720
That's not what you do.

138
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:48,420
All right, here's a proposition to contemplate.

139
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,120
It's another proposition that has revolutionary significance.

140
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:59,120
It'll explain all sorts of things that you know to be true but don't know why they're true.

141
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:11,020
The description of the structure through which you see the world is a story.

142
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,220
That's what a story is.

143
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:21,820
Okay, so now this explains many things that are otherwise left as mysteries or side effects.

144
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,620
I read a book by Stephen Pinker once.

145
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,420
Pinker's an Enlightenment rationalist from Harvard and a good guy and very smart

146
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,220
and much of what he says is extraordinarily useful.

147
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:38,020
But he believes, for example, that our proclivity to enjoy and tell stories is like a side effect

148
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,820
of something more fundamental cognitively.

149
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,720
It's the story as entertainment theory.

150
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,320
You go to a movie because it's fun.

151
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,220
You read a book of fiction to your child because it's fun.

152
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,120
It's not core to the...

153
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,820
What would you say?

154
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,920
It's not a core element of the way that you exist in the world.

155
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,320
It's mere entertainment.

156
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,920
It misses the point that theory.

157
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,620
Why is it entertaining?

158
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,820
Why can you teach children with stories?

159
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:20,920
If you get the story right for a child, you can capture the child's interest and you can integrate

160
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,520
almost any form of learning into the story.

161
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,420
And the child will be captivated by that.

162
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:32,620
When children play, pretend play, which they do spontaneously, they spontaneously dramatize the world.

163
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:41,020
They spontaneously make stories out of their roles and their destinies.

164
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,320
And that captures them.

165
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,620
That forms the basis of their friendships.

166
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:53,420
That's why children want to play so frenetically is that they're practicing modeling the world.

167
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:58,920
When you go see a movie, it's not that you want to be entertained, although it is entertaining.

168
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,620
That's not why you're there.

169
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,720
It's not for fun either.

170
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,720
That's easy to understand and to see.

171
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,820
What's fun about a horror movie?

172
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,020
I'm dead serious.

173
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:17,420
It's like people will be so afraid in a horror movie that they'll cover their eyes.

174
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,120
They'll hide behind the chair in front of them.

175
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,120
They'll ask themselves afterwards why they even put themselves through it.

176
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,320
And yet they'll line up and pay to do it.

177
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:34,320
Well, why would you line up and pay to torture yourself?

178
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:42,720
Well, because you want to know how to deal with what's horrifying.

179
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,720
And you want to practice that in a way, if you can, that isn't in itself fatal.

180
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,260
You want to expose yourself to the catastrophes of existence so that you're prepared when

181
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,120
those catastrophes come along.

182
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,520
You want to expose yourself to the predators that lurk everywhere.

183
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,920
You want to inure yourself against what's disgusting and contaminating because you're

184
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,860
going to have to deal with it.

185
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:11,960
You want to expose yourself to what's frightening so that you can find the courage within you

186
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,000
to deal with what's frightening.

187
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,640
And that's part of the instinct to develop and expand your competence.

188
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:24,920
And it's in that expansion of competence and skill that occurs as a consequence of that

189
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,440
voluntary exposure that the entertainment is situated.

190
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,520
The reason that's entertaining is because it's part of the manner in which you expand

191
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,280
yourself.

192
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,240
And you can do that in the direction of what's dark and terrible just as you can in the direction

193
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,840
of say what's heroic.

194
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,560
What do you do when you go to a movie?

195
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,640
You fasten on to a character and you understand that character the same way that you understand

196
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,600
people that you're in conversation with.

197
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,880
Now you might think that the way that you understand people is by you listen to what

198
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,280
they say and you extract out the knowledge that they're delivering to you in terms of

199
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,680
facts and you interpret the facts and you derive your understanding of the person.

200
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,240
Like none of that's true.

201
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,520
That has absolutely nothing to do with how you establish a relationship with someone.

202
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,280
And well here's some proof.

203
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,400
Is that what you do with a dog?

204
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,320
Well obviously not, but you can establish a relationship with a dog.

205
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,000
And the relationship you have with a dog, it's not the same as the relationship with

206
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,640
a person, but a dog's a pack animal and a dog can become a member of the family.

207
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:39,560
You can understand a dog well enough so the dog likes you.

208
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:46,320
Right, and so whatever you're doing with the dog, it isn't discourse about propositions

209
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,600
because most of the dogs you own don't talk.

210
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:59,000
So and it's the same with very young children and it's the same with an infant.

211
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,520
You establish a relationship using mechanisms that aren't propositional.

212
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,080
They're not rules, they're not descriptions, they're not facts.

213
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,600
That's not how you do it.

214
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
How do you do it?

215
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,400
Where do you look when you talk to someone?

216
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,760
You look at their eyes.

217
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,000
Why?

218
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,240
To see where they're pointing them.

219
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,240
Why?

220
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,720
So you can see what they're looking at.

221
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,560
Why?

222
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:29,200
So you can infer what's important to them because we point our eyes at that which is

223
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,480
important to us.

224
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,160
That's why our eyes look the way they look.

225
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,520
Black in the middle, colored on the ring around that against the white background.

226
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,680
That's an evolved mechanism.

227
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,800
I can see your eyes.

228
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:50,360
All of our ancestors whose eyes weren't visible either got killed or didn't reproduce.

229
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,040
The one thing you want to know about someone right away is where the hell their eyes are

230
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:59,400
pointed and you can do that politely which you do by attending to someone without too

231
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,600
predatory a stare.

232
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,400
You do that by attending politely to their face but not too intensely and not attending

233
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:12,860
let's say inappropriately to other parts of their body and they're going to be watching

234
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:17,280
you to see what you do with your eyes because the one thing you want to know about someone

235
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,080
above all else is what the hell are they up to?

236
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,440
What's their aim?

237
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:30,240
And so when you go to a movie that's what you do and you watch a character in a role.

238
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:38,360
You see him in a variety of different situations and you watch how he structures his attention.

239
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,120
What he pays attention to?

240
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:45,920
His attention is a costly business and so people pay attention to what they value.

241
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:52,880
You watch what they attend to and you watch how they prioritize their actions and from

242
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,800
that you derive an understanding of what's important to them.

243
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,720
As soon as you understand what's important to them you've got their aim.

244
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,080
You figured that character out.

245
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,280
This is what you do when you learn to know someone.

246
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,160
What's their aim?

247
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:16,640
As soon as you know their aim you can see the world through their eyes.

248
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,840
You can see the same objects they see and the objects take on the same emotional significance.

249
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,280
And when you say I come to understand someone what you really mean is, oh I understand their

250
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:34,800
aim and now I can aim at the same thing, at least in simulation, at least fictionally,

251
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:40,760
and I can come to inhabit the same world of perception and emotion that they inhabit.

252
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:46,360
I can even guess at how they might act and to what they might attend in situations I

253
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,720
haven't seen because now I know their aim.

254
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
What's he up to?

255
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,280
That's what you're thinking in a murder mystery or in a thriller.

256
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,280
What's he up to?

257
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,280
What's he up to?

258
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,560
What's going to happen next?

259
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:01,840
And so the plot of the fiction is the aim of the character across time.

260
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,360
The aim as the character unfolds and that might involve the transformation of his aims

261
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,360
as well.

262
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,360
Right?

263
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,800
And that would be the transformation of a character in a movie.

264
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:16,120
He aims at one thing and he learns that that aim is off in some manner or he comes to a

265
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:22,240
bitter and dismal partial end and has to switch course and you want to see people transform

266
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
their aims.

267
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,160
That's character development.

268
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,800
We see the world through a story.

269
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,880
The world's objects reveal themselves in relationship to our aim.

270
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:46,680
The landscape of emotion presents itself as markers on the pathway to our aim.

271
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,400
The world reveals itself in accordance with our aim.

272
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,200
That's how perception works.

273
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,080
That's a hell of a thing to learn because if the world, for example, appears to you

274
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,520
only as thorn-bearing obstacles, right?

275
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,240
If you feel that everything's arrayed against you and there's no pathway forward, if you

276
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:11,840
feel that you're surrounded by foes and obstacles instead of walking the golden pathway accompanied

277
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:19,000
by allies with the world on your side, you might ask yourself whether or not your aim

278
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,920
is wrong.

279
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:27,960
And so the world lays itself out in accordance with our aim.

280
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,200
We produce fiction.

281
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,400
We generate fiction.

282
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,920
We live in a fictional landscape because we want to get our aim right.

283
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,600
We read stories.

284
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,040
We watch movies.

285
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,240
We go to plays.

286
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,560
We talk to each other because we want to get our aim right.

287
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,520
We want to find the place we should go and we want to learn how to get there efficiently.

288
00:21:53,520 --> 00:22:02,800
And we're compelled by spirit and instinct to establish the aim and follow the path and

289
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:11,360
to transform ourselves so that our aim becomes ever more precise and efficient and delivers

290
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,600
us a world that's ever more abundant and beautiful.

291
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,760
And that's all a function of aim.

292
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,080
Big tech companies enrich themselves by taking your personal data.

293
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,480
They grab your web history, email metadata, and video searches to create a detailed profile

294
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,800
on you and then they sell that off to the highest bidder.

295
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,080
Companies aren't just selling products anymore, they're selling you.

296
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,040
To protect your identity and data from these tech giants, I recommend using ExpressVPN every

297
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,600
time you go online.

298
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,640
Think about all the websites you visit.

299
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,720
Everything you do and say online is tracked using your public IP address which allows

300
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,520
them to uniquely match your activity and know your location.

301
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:55,520
ExpressVPN makes you anonymous online by camouflaging your IP address and replacing it with a different

302
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,880
secure IP of your choice.

303
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,800
ExpressVPN also encrypts all of your data to protect it from hackers and anyone else

304
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,560
who might try to spy on you.

305
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,600
What I like most about ExpressVPN though is how easy it is to use.

306
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,080
Just download the app on your phone or computer, tap one button, and you're protected.

307
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,720
So if you're like me and you believe your internet data belongs to you, then ExpressVPN

308
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,280
is the answer.

309
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:25,880

312
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,760
Okay, so we live in a story.

313
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,600
Well then, as soon as you know that, this is what the postmodernists figured out.

314
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:47,880
By the way, this is why the literary critics have become a dominant force in the Cultural

315
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,400
War.

316
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,480
Postmodernists were literary critics who think, well, there's nothing more irrelevant than

317
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,480
the literary critic.

318
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,840
Like, who the hell cares what an intellectual thinks about a story?

319
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:02,420
I mean, of all the preposterous things to be concerned about, that might top the list.

320
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,460
Not if the story is the thing through which you see the world.

321
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,880
If the story is the thing you see through which you see the world, there's nothing more powerful

322
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,040
than a literary critic, except perhaps an author.

323
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:20,840
And we wouldn't have a culture war right now if the literary critic wasn't far more powerful

324
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,840
than anybody had possibly imagined, because the French intellectual literary critics known

325
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:34,280
as the postmodernists have criticized the central story of the West to death.

326
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,200
And that's why we have a culture war.

327
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,800
And it's no joke.

328
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,280
This is foundational.

329
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,280
There's no more serious conflict than that.

330
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,400
And you all can feel that.

331
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,400
That's why you're here.

332
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,900
You know that the world is shaking and uncertain in a way that's new.

333
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,840
And the reason for that is the story itself is under assault.

334
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,760
All right, so let's wander through that a little bit.

335
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,040
You see the world through a story.

336
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,560
The rationalists are empiricists, even the biologists.

337
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,400
They might have an answer to that to say, okay, fair enough, you see the world through

338
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,400
a story.

339
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:14,160
But the story is biologically determined or socioculturally determined.

340
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,080
It's a story of sex.

341
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,040
That would be Freud, because for Freud and for Charles Darwin for that matter, for Richard

342
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:33,600
Dawkins, the famous atheist to an equal degree, the story, the aim is sex, reproduction, and

343
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:45,520
the story is predicated on that aim, Freud, Darwin, Dawkins.

344
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,380
The degenerate element of that is a descent into a kind of hedonism.

345
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:58,080
Because if sex is the story, then why not worship sex?

346
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,880
And some dispute that and say, no, the central story isn't sex.

347
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,640
This would be the Marxists.

348
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:12,440
The central story is power.

349
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:18,400
That's the story that the universities tell when they're not telling the story about sex.

350
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,400
It's all about power.

351
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:31,240
The essential human aim is domination, oppression, victimization, exploitation.

352
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:36,680
The central theme of the family is a power dynamic.

353
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:41,860
The central theme of the relationship between men and women is a power dynamic.

354
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:49,160
Marriage itself is a heteronormative patriarchal establishment of oppression that goes back

355
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,880
to the dawn of time.

356
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,840
The nuclear family is the same thing.

357
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,160
Economic arrangements are nothing but power.

358
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,440
Friendships are nothing but power.

359
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:08,360
The landscape of human interaction is a dynamic of power, or sex, or both, or both fighting

360
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,320
against one another.

361
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,600
Look, these are powerful ideas.

362
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,600
Why?

363
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,600
Well, obvious.

364
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,600
It's obvious.

365
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Why?

366
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:25,760
Well, without sex, there's no reproduction, and without reproduction, there's no people.

367
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:32,800
And so the Darwinian, Freudian, Richard Dawkins' selfish gene claim is that, well, what could

368
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,080
it possibly be other than sex?

369
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:43,480
And the Marxists come running forward and say, hello, power.

370
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:49,640
And then the Marxists say, well, obviously it's power, because there's radical inequality

371
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,640
in the world.

372
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,640
There's some who have and some who have not.

373
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,720
There's no reason to assume that property in the final analysis, let's say, isn't a

374
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,520
form of theft.

375
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:05,720
And everyone who has established themselves in some manner has only done that by stealing

376
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,640
from those who are powerless and who have less, everything they have, and accruing it

377
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,640
to themselves.

378
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,080
That's a credible claim for a variety of reasons.

379
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,240
The first, most fundamental reason is that a minority of people have all the success

380
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,720
on any possible dimension of comparison.

381
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,400
It's a very small number of people who are radically attractive.

382
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,760
It's a very small number of people who are radically gifted in the visual arts, let's

383
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,760
say.

384
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,640
It's a radically small percentage of people who are musicians.

385
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,800
A tiny percentage of the people have most of the money.

386
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:42,000
A tiny percentage of the people gather most of the attention.

387
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,040
It's a pre-do distribution, and that's what Marx pointed on to.

388
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,560
The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.

389
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:55,800
And there's real truth in that, and there's truth in the claim that people structure their

390
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:01,760
relationships with power, and that some people who obtain success do it as a consequence

391
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,200
of exploitation.

392
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:10,320
And it's equally true that when any human relationship deteriorates, it tends to deteriorate

393
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,360
in the relationship of power.

394
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,640
If your marriage starts to become shaky, then you begin to exploit each other.

395
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,280
Use force.

396
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,360
You try to get your way.

397
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,080
You try to dominate.

398
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,200
It's the same within any family that's deteriorating into a state of pathology.

399
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,240
It's the same in any organization.

400
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,920
We've seen huge states deteriorate into the tyrannical use of power.

401
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:47,080
If you had to identify a cardinal attribute of mankind, power is a reasonable hypothesis.

402
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,120
But let's think about that for a minute.

403
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:59,480
So imagine that, well, imagine that it's sex that is and should be the complete story

404
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,480
of mankind.

405
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,960
Well, what does that mean exactly?

406
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,520
What's a world organized on that basis?

407
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,080
What does a world organized on that basis look like?

408
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,880
Well, there's nothing more important than sex.

409
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,080
Well, how about immediate sexual gratification whenever you want it?

410
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:20,320
How about immediate sexual gratification as the archetype of hedonism?

411
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,560
How about immediate sexual gratification whenever you want it, regardless of what anyone else

412
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,720
has to say about it?

413
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:33,840
Because if it's the story and it's the fundamental story, then what stops me from gaining access

414
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:40,280
to what I want right now, regardless of the cost to anyone else?

415
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,880
If there's nothing beyond that, if only the naive believe that there's anything noble

416
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,520
about humanity beyond the immediate demand of reproduction, then what have you got to

417
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,280
say that's moral about sex and why the hell shouldn't everybody just do exactly what they

418
00:30:54,280 --> 00:31:03,080
want with whoever they want whenever they want all the time?

419
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,040
And with power, you can make exactly the same argument.

420
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:12,600
And classical societies, aristocratic societies, militaristic and martial societies are predicated

421
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,840
on this idea.

422
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:21,200
If I can push you around, all that indicates is that I should push you around because if

423
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:27,720
you're so weak that I can push you around, you have absolutely no ground whatsoever to

424
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,720
stand on to oppose me.

425
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,820
Because if you were moral by the traditions of power, I wouldn't be able to push you around.

426
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:41,120
And so it's very difficult to argue out of that from a rational perspective.

427
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,160
Why doesn't it make right?

428
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,120
And why isn't it only the weak who claim that that's wrong?

429
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,760
And why isn't it only that the weak claim that that's wrong?

430
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,200
Not because they're moral, but because they're weak.

431
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:59,040
That would certainly be a spin-off on the Nietzschean notion that will to power constitutes

432
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,960
the core of man.

433
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:09,680
And I would say up until the dawn of Judeo-Christian ethic, let's say, power ruled.

434
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,840
And then we could imagine what sort of world it's like when power rules.

435
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,360
Well, we know what that world's like.

436
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:19,960
It's like pay attention to the strongest or suffer the consequences.

437
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:30,160
Well, is there something beyond that that's not mere naivety?

438
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:37,520
What's if it isn't power that's the story, and if it isn't sex that's the story.

439
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,840
What's the story?

440
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:48,440
For the West, the answer to that is the library of the Bible.

441
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,880
That's the story.

442
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,840
It's the story upon which the West is founded.

443
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:00,960
It's the story that has arisen over thousands of years, tens of thousands of years, for

444
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:10,800
that matter, attempting to address the core issue.

445
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,320
What's the fundamental story?

446
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:19,960
It's no mystery to make the claim that the claim of the biblical library of stories,

447
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:25,320
because it is a library, is that it's the fundamental story.

448
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:31,880
All right, so we live in a story.

449
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:36,320
We've identified the competitors, power and sex.

450
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,840
What is it that's being expressed in the biblical story?

451
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,280
Look, if you go to a movie, you read a complex book, you go to a sophisticated movie, a

452
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:50,320
sophisticated play, a Shakespearean play, or you read a sophisticated work of fiction,

453
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,680
you see a multi-dimensional characterization, right?

454
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:59,240
A comic book has a hero with one motive.

455
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:06,880
A sophisticated work of fiction has a hero, and perhaps an anti-hero, with complex multi-dimensional

456
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,520
motivations.

457
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:17,040
Whatever characterizes those more realistic people isn't reducible to any single attribute.

458
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:23,440
And in a complicated work of fiction, the author walks you through a multi-dimensional

459
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,680
characterization.

460
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:30,920
You see the same person, the hero aiming upward, the anti-hero or villain aiming downward.

461
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,800
You see that person portrayed in multiple different situations.

462
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:43,520
And pursuing partial reflections of their ultimate aim.

463
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:54,800
And in consequence of that, you learn to understand and embody that complex of aims.

464
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,760
When you see a movie and you watch the hero, you're watching the hero to learn how to act

465
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,840
like a hero.

466
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,560
When you're watching a movie and you watch the anti-hero or the villain, you're watching

467
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:13,080
the movie to learn how not to fail catastrophically and land in hell while taking everyone else

468
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,880
along with you.

469
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:23,820
Is it reducible to something as simple as power or sex?

470
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,040
Not if it's not a comic book.

471
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,360
You need a multi-dimensional characterization.

472
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,800
All right.

473
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:37,920
The biblical corpus provides a multi-dimensional characterization of the fundamental aim of

474
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,720
man and cosmos.

475
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,120
That's the claim of the book.

476
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:49,120
So I'm going to walk you through some of the stories and show you what's being revealed.

477
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,120
What's being revealed is the proper object of worship.

478
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,120
Okay.

479
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,120
So what does that mean?

480
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,800
The proper object of celebration.

481
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:01,640
The aim towards which all sacrifices and work are to be directed.

482
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,640
That which should be held in the highest regard.

483
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,640
That which should be imitated in ritual and admiration.

484
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,640
Okay.

485
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,320
So that's the idea.

486
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:25,680
Admiration in the same way that a small child who hero worships the boy down the street who's

487
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:35,720
the baseball star because that boy portrays a pattern of skill and attention that is the

488
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,720
next appropriate developmental step for the hero worshiping child.

489
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,800
That's a recreation of the religious impulse.

490
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,760
The impulse to look up, admire, and imitate.

491
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,720
The question being to what should we address our attention upward looking, admire, and

492
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,160
imitate.

493
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:08,640
That highest possible object of apprehension and admiration is by definition God.

494
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,400
It's a definition.

495
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,360
It's the highest aim that lurks behind all proximal aims.

496
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,920
That's a good way of thinking about it.

497
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,960
It's the upward aim as such.

498
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,520
All right.

499
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,120
How do you bring that down to earth?

500
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,760
Well, let's start with Genesis one.

501
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:33,080
There's a characterization of God and man in Genesis one.

502
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:37,400
The story opens at the dawn of time, at the beginning of things.

503
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,000
That's not exactly the beginning of time.

504
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,960
That's usually how it's read, but it's more complex than that.

505
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,440
It's not only the beginning of time in the linear sense, but it's the beginning of all

506
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,160
things that begin.

507
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,920
This is what happens every time something begins.

508
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,800
This is what happens every time something new makes its entry into the world.

509
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:04,120
It's the continual beginning that continually unfolds, that happened and is happening now

510
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,240
and will always happen.

511
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:19,200
It's the pattern of the emergence of order out of chaos that makes itself manifest in

512
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,080
the form of your life.

513
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,880
How is the stage set?

514
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:33,600
The Spirit of God hovers over the water, over the deep.

515
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:44,200
You hear that in the Judeo-Christian tradition, God engenders the world ex nihilo out of nothing.

516
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,760
That's not how the story sets itself up.

517
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:53,160
It sets itself up with the Spirit of God hovering above the waters, but it's not water.

518
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,360
That's not the word.

519
00:38:54,360 --> 00:39:04,880
Water is one of the symbolic images attempting to make what's being described clear using

520
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,240
a sequence of complex metaphors.

521
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:14,280
The word for the water over which the Spirit of God hovers is tohu-vabohu, or tehom, and

522
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,920
it means a lot of things.

523
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:24,440
It means the dragon that lives at the bottom of the deepest well.

524
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:31,000
It means the unplumbable depths of the most abysmal ocean.

525
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,240
It means the water that brings forth life.

526
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:42,040
It means the infinite well of possibility itself.

527
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:48,680
It means the confusion that rains when your world falls apart.

528
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:59,800
It means the unstructured day that makes itself manifest when you wake up.

529
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,240
It means all of that.

530
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:08,920
It means the dragon that the archaic God sliced into pieces and made the world from.

531
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:16,200
It means it's the hydra that Hercules defeats to form the world.

532
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,360
It's all of that.

533
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,200
So what does that mean?

534
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:28,760
It means that the Spirit of Being and Becoming generates the world from possibility.

535
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,240
What does that mean?

536
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,760
That's what your consciousness does.

537
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,760
That's what you do.

538
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,240
See, you think you're surrounded by a world of objects that you manipulate in a robotic

539
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:44,040
fashion, but you're not concerned with the objects that are static.

540
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:49,360
You're concerned with what you can dynamically transform when you wake up in the morning.

541
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:56,920
What presents itself to you is a field of indeterminate opportunity.

542
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:02,800
That's why you're worried or perhaps excited because you have something to grapple with

543
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,880
that hasn't yet come into being.

544
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,960
The possibilities of the day, and you might think, oh my God, I have so many things to

545
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,960
do.

546
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,960
I'm overwhelmed.

547
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,960
It's too much.

548
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,880
Well, that's the Tohu Vabohu.

549
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,000
That's the chaos and confusion.

550
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,280
That's a plethora of possibility.

551
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,800
You're thinking, oh my God, how many ways are there for things to go wrong?

552
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:29,560
Well, that's the multi-headed serpent that the hero always confronts.

553
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,080
And what do you have to do with that?

554
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,080
It's like, well, are you going to establish the order that you have to do with that?

555
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:38,760
Are you going to establish the order that's good in the course of the day?

556
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,840
Because that's what you're called upon to do.

557
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:48,040
And it's your recreation of what God himself does at the beginning of time that constitutes

558
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:53,560
the action of your conscious on the possibility that's in front of you.

559
00:41:53,560 --> 00:42:02,680
You have a microcosm of plenitude and possibility right in front of you at any moment that you

560
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:08,480
can wrestle into order if your aim is right.

561
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:19,400
The process that God relies on to extract the cosmos, the order that's good, from the

562
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:24,720
well of unformed possibility is the word.

563
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,240
It's the logos.

564
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:32,120
What does that mean?

565
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:37,000
How much hell can you bring into being by saying the wrong words to your wife?

566
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,560
Right, now your wife is who she is, but she's also who she could become as you've no doubt

567
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,520
noticed many times.

568
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:53,120
And you can extract out something good or something terrible from the possibility she

569
00:42:53,120 --> 00:43:01,680
represents with the cautious and loving application of your words or with the careful and prideful

570
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,240
and dismissive application of your words.

571
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:10,680
And the world you live in will be radically different depending on which of those two

572
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,360
approaches you apply.

573
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:17,560
And that will be exactly the same with anyone else you talk to and how you treat yourself

574
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,000
and how you interact with the world as such.

575
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:31,680
Because there's a provision of possibility that you're offered as a participant in the

576
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:37,520
process of creation that you formulate in accordance with your aim.

577
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:42,000
What's the insistence in Genesis 1?

578
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,120
Aim up with love.

579
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:51,680
So if you want to establish the paradise of your household in relationship to your wife

580
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:59,460
and your children, you aim at what's best for the best in them.

581
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:03,520
You offer them the security that you can imagine.

582
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,120
That's the walls of the walled garden.

583
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:17,220
And you present to them the challenge that allows them to unfold and develop optimally.

584
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:23,600
And you do that appropriately if you're aiming at what's best, what's highest.

585
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:31,400
And that's the spirit of God that makes itself manifest on the waters of possibility.

586
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:41,040
That's the embodiment, the source, the initial source, and the spirit of upward-aiming ultimate

587
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,600
love.

588
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:51,440
You can understand this by understanding what sort of walled garden you produce in your

589
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,840
own household with your aim.

590
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:08,040
God wrestles with the possibility that's not yet manifest and creates the cosmic order

591
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,440
as a consequence, in sequence.

592
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,880
Creating the fundamental divisions to begin with.

593
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,600
The separation of light and darkness.

594
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,560
That's the phenomenology of day and night.

595
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,000
The separation of the land from the waters.

596
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:29,880
The establishment of the dome of the sky over the disk of the earth populates the world

597
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:45,560
with its created beings and on the sixth day produces man and says in his own image.

598
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:52,120
So now we have a characterization of God who's the dynamic process that gives rise to

599
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:59,920
order from possibility itself in keeping with the highest possible aim.

600
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:06,280
And we have a characterization of the human being as a microcosm of that process.

601
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:17,200
The notion that each of us has a worth that's transcendental and not given by the state,

602
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:25,240
not given by yourself, not given by other individuals is predicated on that image.

603
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,480
I mean that historically and I mean it conceptually.

604
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:37,560
The notion is that, one of the notions is that the state itself has to grant to you

605
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:47,040
the worth of someone created in the image of the creator himself in order even for the

606
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:52,440
state to exist, maintain itself and transform.

607
00:46:52,440 --> 00:47:00,700
That the state itself cannot function unless it establishes a sacred boundary between its

608
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:07,560
operations and the operation of the psyche, the human psyche, the human spirit that's

609
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:13,560
a manifestation of the God who generates the order that's good from possibility.

610
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:17,600
As your business grows, the workload can become overwhelming tasks that used to take a day

611
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,600
now take a week.

627
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,040
And you might ask, well, who believes that?

628
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:25,640
And I would say, try talking to one person once without believing that and see how it

629
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,240
goes.

630
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:32,300
We call to each other all the time, especially in our intimate relationships, to be treated

631
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:38,240
as if we are the locus of value.

632
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,840
And if you treat people that way, if you regard them that way, if you perceive them

633
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:54,080
that way, if you encourage them in that pathway of development, everything in your interactions

634
00:48:54,080 --> 00:49:00,720
with human beings will open itself up to you and fill your life with abundance.

635
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,040
Everyone wants to be treated that way.

636
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:08,880
And the reason for that is, it's in keeping with our essential nature.

637
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:22,360
And that that hospitable, welcoming, encouraging, upward-aiming, loving treatment is the aim

638
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:34,600
and attitude upon which the soul, the community, and the natural order itself depends for its

639
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,640
integrity.

640
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,180
Your country is predicated on that notion.

641
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:48,760
The idea that each of you is endowed with inalienable rights and their requisite responsibilities

642
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:52,560
is a direct reflection of that conceptualization.

643
00:49:52,560 --> 00:50:00,360
And one of the things you might frequently remind yourself of is the fact that your country

644
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:07,040
wouldn't be what it is, which is the closest approximation to a shining city on the hill

645
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:14,640
that's been established so far in the travail of mankind without that fundamental conception.

646
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,760
Right?

647
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,520
So then, you might say, well, is it true?

648
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:26,400
And the answer is, it's not hell.

649
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,000
I mean that because lots of countries are hell.

650
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,960
And they're hell in a way that opens up into an abyss and has the possibility of a deeper

651
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:43,240
abyss rating latent within it, which will open up with the possibility of a deeper abyss

652
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,720
within that.

653
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:52,040
And that's what happens when that fundamental characterization is overthrown in a revolutionary

654
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,760
manner or carelessly abandoned.

655
00:50:54,760 --> 00:51:02,880
And we saw that for all of us who are non-believers and no longer conceptualize the metaphysical

656
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:10,320
hell as real, we saw the metaphysical hell realized in the 20th century many times in

657
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:19,880
case anyone having abandoned their metaphysical presuppositions was so blind that only an

658
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,440
object lesson would suffice.

659
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,760
Right?

660
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:33,200
Only Germany, the Soviet Union under Stalin, the Chinese Communist Party under Mao, if

661
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:40,520
that isn't close enough to hell for you, then I would say you should pray that you aren't

662
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:51,080
introduced to something even worse for the purposes of convincing you about what's real.

663
00:51:51,080 --> 00:52:01,640
In the second, God announces two things, three things, four things once he creates man.

664
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:07,400
He says, man is to tend the garden, that's his purpose.

665
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,400
Why a garden?

666
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,600
It's a walled garden actually because that's what paradise means, walled garden.

667
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,600
Why a walled garden?

668
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:19,760
Well, a garden is a place of nature, obviously, and walls are a place of culture, and a walled

669
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:27,480
garden is a place of nature encapsulated in a manageable manner by the walls of culture.

670
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,040
That's what your backyard is.

671
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:35,200
It's a yard, it's nature, it has walls, the walls are culture, the walls you could think

672
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:45,200
of as physical entities, as objects, but your lawn has borders if you don't have a fence

673
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,920
and your neighbors know where the borders are and where are the borders?

674
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:51,400
Well, they're in the imagination of your neighbors.

675
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,920
I'm dead serious about that.

676
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,360
The walls, it's so funny because you'll see people in the border between Canada and the

677
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:01,840
United States, they'll get out and they'll step across the border.

678
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:08,840
It's like, as if it's an object, as if it's an entity that's there on the ground, and

679
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:17,520
people know that that's magic in some sense because the grass in Canada is only slightly

680
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:24,760
less healthy than the grass in the United States, let's say.

681
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:30,560
It's easy to concretize that, but the idea of a walled off space in a communal society

682
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,320
is a social agreement.

683
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:37,720
You have your domain, your house, your garden, your backyard.

684
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:42,080
That's enough cosmos for you to set right, and perhaps if you're competent enough to

685
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:48,440
do more, you'll expand your garden so that you have more to tend.

686
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:57,000
But you start with a walled garden of some size, and if you tend it properly, then the

687
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:05,560
promise is that as your competence grows, so will your dominion.

688
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:10,400
Man sent to tend the garden, and to name everything that's in it.

689
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,720
This is Adam.

690
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,240
What does that mean?

691
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,960
Well, it's the logos again.

692
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:23,000
It's a re-representation of the creative spirit of God that makes itself manifest when time

693
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,120
begins and when new things come into being.

694
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:34,400
Our ability to name, our ability to speak, is that in the microcosmic manner.

695
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:39,400
What we're capable of doing, that's what the patriarchal spirit does is name and order

696
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:44,600
the world, and God brings everything to Adam to see what he'll name them.

697
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:53,000
And that's a reflection of the idea that we have a created order, but man has a place

698
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,760
in it, and the place is to organize it and to put everything in its proper place and

699
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,240
to assign it its identity.

700
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:09,200
And that's no different than the prioritization of attention that's part of the story.

701
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,560
Name things in relationship to their function.

702
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:23,400
Put things in place in relationship to their significance in the hierarchy of being.

703
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:29,080
Orient them, orient all named things upward.

704
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:34,200
Sequence, constrain, organize, and order.

705
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,000
The manifestation of the patriarchal spirit.

706
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,400
What does God decide?

707
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,240
It's not good enough.

708
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,240
Man lacks a helper.

709
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:46,400
Man needs a helper.

710
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:57,600
Woman's created as a consequence because the order that men produce because of their limitations

711
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:07,280
is insufficient, and something has to be introduced to speak for that which is not included.

712
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,480
That's the role of woman.

713
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,800
That's the biblical role of the woman.

714
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,200
It's the biological role of the mother.

715
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,560
You know this in your own household.

716
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:24,200
Women bring the concerns of the marginalized to the center.

717
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:29,640
You can think about that politically, and it's useful to think about it politically.

718
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:34,400
All established human orders exclude.

719
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,920
The exclusion causes pain.

720
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:41,400
The pain of exclusion requires a voice.

721
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:46,160
That's the voice of the eternal mother.

722
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,760
That's where Genesis 1 ends.

723
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,720
Genesis 2 contains the story of Adam and Eve.

724
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:56,240
It's another creation story.

725
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:00,360
It's commensurate with the first one.

726
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:05,560
It's a variation on a theme.

727
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:13,560
God creates Adam out of matter, earth, and breath, spirit.

728
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,560
Why?

729
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,840
Because that's what human beings are.

730
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:21,160
We're material creatures that are animated.

731
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,480
Anima means spirit.

732
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,720
We...

733
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,600
What's the spirit?

734
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:36,160
The spirit is the living organizing principle of the material.

735
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:42,720
Human beings are an amalgam of the living organizing principle and the material.

736
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,760
That's what's portrayed in the creation of Adam.

737
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,760
The combination of matter and spirit.

738
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:52,200
The combination of material and conscious.

739
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,920
You could think about it that way if you're more secular minded.

740
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,560
We're conscious matter.

741
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,680
What's up with that?

742
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,200
No one understands that.

743
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,320
No materialist understands that.

744
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,200
We understand nothing about consciousness.

745
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:12,680
It's as mysterious now as it's been throughout the entire course of our existence.

746
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:16,240
It's never been reduced to material phenomenon.

747
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,440
We have no idea what that would even mean.

748
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:22,440
And if we did reduce it to the material, all that would mean was that we inadvertently

749
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:25,120
elevated the material.

750
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,480
We treat our each other like we're conscious.

751
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,320
We presume from first principles that we're conscious.

752
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:36,280
We can't even distinguish between being itself and being conscious.

753
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:45,000
And so that's a perfectly reasonable representation of man.

754
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:51,960
Woman is taken from man, from a rib, from the side as an equal.

755
00:58:51,960 --> 00:59:00,440
There's a critique of patriarchal Judeo-Christian narrative from the resentful feminist side

756
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:05,320
that makes the claim that the biblical narrative is, for example, radically patriarchal in

757
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:10,520
its orientation, dooming women to subjugation.

758
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:13,920
That's a preposterous claim, by the way.

759
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,200
It's not only false.

760
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,080
It's false in a very particular way.

761
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:22,400
There are falsehoods that are approximations of the truth.

762
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,080
There are falsehoods so deep that they're the exact opposite of the truth.

763
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:33,760
And the truth of the matter is that right from the first words, the biblical library

764
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:40,600
is miraculous in its insistence that women like men are made in the image of God.

765
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,520
That emerges in the first chapter.

766
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:53,640
In that Eve is the equal of Adam in every manner, although complementary and not identical.

767
00:59:53,640 --> 01:00:02,680
And our society is riven by conflict so deep that we now doubt both of those propositions.

768
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:08,520
There's no form of confusion more profound than that.

769
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:12,400
Sexually reproducing creatures without nervous systems can tell the difference between male

770
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,400
and female.

771
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:21,520
I'm dead serious about that.

772
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:25,800
If you can get people to swallow the lie that there's no difference between men and women,

773
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:31,080
there is no lie they won't swallow.

774
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:34,200
Right?

775
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:44,440
God makes Adam and Eve, each with their own role, and he puts them in the garden to play

776
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:49,200
forever under the watchful eye of their heavenly Father.

777
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:53,880
And he tells them they have free reign in the garden with everything delightful that's

778
01:00:53,880 --> 01:01:00,520
being created, that's being created, except for one thing, they're not to eat the fruit

779
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:08,640
of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

780
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,040
So what does that mean?

781
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:13,720
Man, that's a mystery.

782
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:21,200
I spent a long time trying to crack the micro-narratives in the story of Adam and Eve, and it wasn't

783
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:29,120
until three or four years ago that I think I started to understand that particular fragment

784
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,120
of the story.

785
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:35,920
A friend of mine is here, Jonathan Pazzo, some of you might have been following him.

786
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:43,800
Jonathan and his brother Matthew really helped me crack this, and so we're here, I'm here

787
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:48,680
with Jonathan and a number of my other colleagues and friends right now with the Daily Wire recording

788
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,600
another seminar.

789
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:55,560
We released an Exodus seminar, we're recording a seminar in the Gospels right now, we're

790
01:01:55,560 --> 01:02:04,040
about 60% of the way through that, and so just so you know, that's also forthcoming.

791
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:10,760
God tells human beings, he makes one fundamental rule, do not eat of the fruit of the tree

792
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,040
of the knowledge of good and evil.

793
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:15,160
Okay, that's moral knowledge.

794
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:20,560
That should be self-evident, knowledge of good and evil, that's moral knowledge.

795
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:23,840
Moral knowledge is predicated on the idea that there's an upward path and a downward

796
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:27,360
path, that there are desirable things and that there are undesirable things, and that

797
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:32,320
the pinnacle of what's desirable is what's heavenly or paradisal, and in the abysmal

798
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:36,680
depths of what's undesirable is the diabolical and the hellish.

799
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:39,680
And that's the moral landscape, that's the landscape of good and evil.

800
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:47,360
That's the fictional landscape, fictional in the sense of characterization and plot, fictional

801
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:51,880
in the sense of distilled truth, not falsehood.

802
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:58,360
Fictional in the sense that the fiction describes the structure through which you see the world.

803
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:02,280
Fiction as the deepest form of truth.

804
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:08,360
What does it mean to eat of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil?

805
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:15,600
When Nietzsche announced the death of God in the late 1800s, he said something that

806
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,880
he believed would constitute a pathway forward.

807
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:25,920
He said, we have dispensed with God, we are the greatest murderers who ever lived.

808
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:33,920
We've engaged in a murder so profound that we'll never wash away the blood.

809
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:42,240
How could we possibly conduct ourselves in the aftermath of that murder?

810
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:46,520
You read of Nietzsche as a triumphant anti-Christian.

811
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:54,280
He was a very complicated person and he knew perfectly well that the dissolution of the

812
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:57,800
Christian metaphysics would produce a cataclysmic consequence.

813
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:05,880
He predicted in the late 1800s that Europe would turn to a radically resentful egalitarian

814
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:12,560
communitarianism that would kill tens of millions of people, which is exactly what happened.

815
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:17,680
And he saw that coming just as clearly as his Russian counterpart Theodor Dostoevsky

816
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,000
saw it.

817
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,280
He knew what would rise in the aftermath of the death of God.

818
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:29,520
He knew that resentment and communitarianism would be one temptation.

819
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:33,080
And he tried to formulate an alternative path.

820
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:36,680
He said, we're going to have to create our own values.

821
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:43,320
We're going to have to take it upon ourselves to create the moral landscape.

822
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:48,040
I read that and I understood why he said that.

823
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:53,960
I could see its influence on clinical psychology, for example, the notion of the self-actualized

824
01:04:53,960 --> 01:05:00,000
person, the notion that our soul should unfold in the direction that's commensurate with

825
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,960
the deepest understanding of our subjective selves, right?

826
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:08,400
The radical unveiling of subjectivity, self-definition.

827
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:15,960
I am what I say I am, which is a radical claim in our society now, a claim of omniscience.

828
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:22,000
Not only am I who I say I am, you better act like I'm who I say I am.

829
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,440
That's the claim of the radical subjective.

830
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,880
Well, what's wrong with that claim?

831
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,800
Well, the psychoanalysts criticized Nietzsche very effectively.

832
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:34,120
He said, look, how are you going to create your own values when you're not mastering

833
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,680
your own house?

834
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:38,600
Have you tried telling yourself what to do?

835
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,200
How does that work for you?

836
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,760
I know you're just your own obedient servant, right?

837
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:43,960
You're so morally pure.

838
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:48,360
You just tell yourself at New Year's that you're going to go to the gym and you're

839
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:53,960
going to diet and you're going to be some stellar, physique, lean, mean fighting machine

840
01:05:53,960 --> 01:06:00,280
by March and you go once and then you tell yourself lies about why you don't have to

841
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,200
go again, and that's the end of that.

842
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:13,120
And if you were capable of creating your own values, you wouldn't be the banner, the

843
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:17,720
tattered banner that blows in the wind of its own whims.

844
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:20,240
The psychoanalysts figured this out very quickly.

845
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:25,760
You're a war of competing whims, and a creature like that's going to have a very difficult

846
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:34,120
time navigating the complex landscape of the ultimate moral pronouncement.

847
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:37,520
Who are you to make a decision about what constitutes good and evil?

848
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,960
And that's what God tells men and women.

849
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:44,280
It's like you don't get to create the moral order, you get to dwell within it.

850
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:47,560
You get to align yourself with the pre-existent moral order.

851
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:57,000
You do not take to yourself the right, the presumption to define good and evil themselves.

852
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:06,760
You bow your head to good and you pray for deliverance from evil.

853
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:13,160
And if you violate that, look the hell out, and that's the pronouncement.

854
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:17,080
And so what happens?

855
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:22,440
The serpent offers Eve the fruit.

856
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,680
Why the serpent?

857
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:27,560
Well the serpent is camouflaged.

858
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:32,720
The serpent is crafty, subtle.

859
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:37,280
The serpent is marginalized.

860
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,200
The serpent is the voice of pride.

861
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,960
The serpent is Lucifer.

862
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:47,560
That's the metaphysical surrounding of the story that develops over centuries the notion

863
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:53,400
that the serpent in the Garden of Paradise is Lucifer himself, the spirit of pride.

864
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,400
What does that mean?

865
01:07:54,400 --> 01:08:00,720
It's prideful presumption that makes you assume that you can define the moral order.

866
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:05,880
What's the prideful presumption of Eve at the beginning of time and forever?

867
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:09,680
I can even clasp the serpent to my breast.

868
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:20,120
It's the careless welcoming in of the monstrous and prideful under the guise of the pretension

869
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:21,960
of maternal compassion.

870
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:28,440
And if you can't see that happening in our society, you're blind.

871
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:32,400
It might be easy to just toss all of your discipline to the side for the summer, but

872
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,480
a life of greatness doesn't happen by taking the easy route.

873
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:39,560

890
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:43,840
And what's the sin of Adam?

891
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:47,200
Well, what do men care about?

892
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:57,160
Women care about, properly about, the helpless infant.

893
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:02,440
Men have powerful feminine virtue and it can be inverted and made prideful and trumpeted

894
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:09,920
and presumptuous to infantilize the world and to advertise that compassion as a badge

895
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:18,000
of worth and honor, as a mode of attaining status.

896
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,080
What's Adam's sin?

897
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,640
What do men care about?

898
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:33,040
Taking women, men are ambitious fundamentally to impress women, for better or for worse.

899
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:42,280
What's the prideful pathway and false pathway to establishing a relationship with the two

900
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:45,720
demanding feminine?

901
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:48,560
I've got it.

902
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,360
Anything you want, dear.

903
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:51,560
Right.

904
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:53,000
And that's Adam's sin.

905
01:10:53,000 --> 01:11:01,080
He eve hearkens to the voice of the serpent and clutches it to her breast.

906
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:07,200
Despite the clear injunction from the divine, never to do that.

907
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:14,640
And Adam, weakly does exactly what the worst part of his wife wants.

908
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:20,640
And so here we are, folks.

909
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:23,000
So what's the consequence of that?

910
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:29,120
Well, the scales fall from the rise and they notice they're naked.

911
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,320
And they're deeply ashamed and they cover up.

912
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,320
They become self-conscious.

913
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:38,480
Okay, so when do people become self-conscious?

914
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,400
When they make prideful errors.

915
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:47,560
When you overreach and you reveal your inadequacy as a consequence of the mismatch between your

916
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,880
pride and your ability.

917
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:52,160
You'll be ashamed.

918
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:55,920
You'll recognize your insufficiency.

919
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:00,720
You'll be aware of yourself as an isolated entity.

920
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:04,080
That's all to become self-conscious.

921
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:07,280
Psychologists have learned over the last 40 years that there's no difference between being

922
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:10,280
conscious of yourself and being miserable.

923
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,840
Those are literally the same thing.

924
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:21,840
If you're living a life of other-centered, communally-oriented, hospitable calling, you're

925
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:26,440
not attending to the miseries of your isolated self.

926
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:33,960
If you stay in your bailiwick and you don't put forward your hand presumptuously, you can

927
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:37,280
live in the absence of painful self-consciousness.

928
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:41,200
Pride goes before a fall.

929
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:46,520
We have a month devoted to pride in our culture, right?

930
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:47,600
Pride goes before a fall.

931
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,640
You know this in your own life.

932
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:55,880
You can ask yourself, and this has been a Christian conundrum since the beginning of time, is

933
01:12:55,880 --> 01:13:00,160
your life miserable because misery is baked into the structure of the world?

934
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:05,360
Or is your life miserable because you do stupid things and refuse to learn and bring endless

935
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:08,160
misery on yourself in your presumption?

936
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:12,200
You know, you might say a little of column A and a little of column B, and fair enough,

937
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:19,640
but you certainly know that the most painful episodes of your life come when you claim

938
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:23,200
falsely to be more than you are.

939
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:34,040
And the core narrative in the Christian, Judeo-Christian ethos is that the fall of man into the profane

940
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:37,120
world is a consequence of pride.

941
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,760
And that is really something worth thinking about.

942
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:44,560
You know, Adam and Eve are called upon to work in misery as a consequence of their pride.

943
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:50,440
Well, could you work joyfully if you didn't overreach yourself, if you were aiming upward

944
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:54,480
properly, if you were telling the truth, if you were acting communally, if you were acting

945
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:59,640
in relationship to what was highest, would it be possible that your work would be joyful

946
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,760
and bring abundance?

947
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:04,800
Isn't there times in your life when that's happened?

948
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:10,480
Is it the case that you move forward in misery in precise proportion to the pretension of

949
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,960
your aim?

950
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:18,160
It's worth considering.

951
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:23,680
It's the suspicion that arises at the end of the story that begins history because it's

952
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:33,440
with the prideful fall of Adam and Eve that history begins.

953
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:36,800
Adam and Eve discover they're naked and they hide.

954
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:41,080
And God comes along and says, Adam, where are you?

955
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:45,680
And Adam says, I'm over here, I'm hiding.

956
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,040
And God says, well, why are you hiding?

957
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,000
It's a foolish thing to do, right?

958
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,960
Because Adam is perfectly aware that God can see through bushes.

959
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,680
Adam is hiding from God.

960
01:14:54,680 --> 01:15:00,440
Is it your pathetic self-consciousness that makes you hide from God?

961
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:01,600
That's a good question.

962
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:07,520
Are you not everything you could be because you're ashamed of who you are?

963
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,480
That's what that story indicates.

964
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:12,960
And so God calls Adam on, he says, who told you?

965
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:13,960
Why are you hiding?

966
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,160
And Adam says, well, I'm naked.

967
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:20,240
And God says, well, how do you find out that you were naked?

968
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:23,520
How did you find out that you were inadequate?

969
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:27,320
How did you find out that you are shameful?

970
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:31,160
And Adam says, you know that woman you made me?

971
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,000
It's her fault.

972
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,560
And that's the second sin of Adam.

973
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:38,880
And that's another indication of the non-patriarchal nature of the text.

974
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:43,760
You know, Eve is the first human being to take a bite of the apple, but Adam follows

975
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:44,760
along.

976
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:49,600
And it isn't obvious to me that the follower of sin is in a worse, better moral position

977
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,200
than the initiator.

978
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:55,960
And then he compounds his sin, like men do, by blaming the woman.

979
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:56,960
Why is your life so...

980
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,160
Well, if you had my wife, man, you'd know.

981
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,920
It's like those damn women.

982
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:06,280
It's like it's a handy excuse for men all the time to say that, and it's not least because

983
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:11,280
men can't tolerate being rejected by women, and women reject them all the time.

984
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:15,320
And the reason women reject them is because they're not all they should be.

985
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:19,800
And so, of course, that makes men painfully self-conscious and makes them shake their fist

986
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:22,240
at God and makes them hide.

987
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:27,680
And so, well, God says, and so Adam reveals himself in this pathetic manner.

988
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:31,520
It's like he can't even take responsibility for his own misstep.

989
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:37,680
He has to blame the thing that's been granted to him as the highest form of gift.

990
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:41,360
And not only her, but God.

991
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,360
Whose fault is it?

992
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,360
Well, it's not mine.

993
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,160
It's probably women's fault.

994
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:47,880
And if it's not women, it's clearly God.

995
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:51,320
It can't be me.

996
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,320
So what happens?

997
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:56,760
Well, both Adam and Eve are condemned to suffer in their work.

998
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:59,440
And that's how history begins.

999
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:04,840
And that's the situation of the fallen world.

1000
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:18,080
And that's the description of the landscape of profound fiction that we inhabit.

1001
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:26,640
And that's only a tiny fraction of the characterization of God and man in the biblical corpus.

1002
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:29,640
Thank you very much.
