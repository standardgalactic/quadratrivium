1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,880
Hi, everybody. I'm pleased today to be talking with

2
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:30,800
Jaco Willink, who I've talked with on his podcast on three separate occasions. I don't think I've had

3
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,680
Jaco on mind. And my memory isn't what it should be. So but I'm quite sure that we've so far when

4
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,560
we've talked, it's been on your podcast. So I thought I'd take the time today to get to know you

5
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:49,600
in some more detail. Jaco is an American author, podcaster, and retired naval officer who served

6
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,200
in the Navy SEALs. He coauthored the book's Extreme Ownership and the Dichotomy of Leadership

7
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:03,040
with fellow retired SEAL Leif Babin. Did I pronounce that right? It's actually Leif Babin.

8
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,080
Oh, so I didn't pronounce it right at all. Leif Babin. He hosts a weekly podcast with Brazilian

9
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,920
jiu-jitsu practitioner, Echo Charles, called the Jaco podcast. He has a million subscribers on

10
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,680
YouTube, and his podcast attracts many more listeners. He co-founded the management consulting

11
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,360
firm Echelon Front, LLC, and has extended his business development on a number of additional

12
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,840
fronts. His military service included combat actions in the war in Iraq, where he eventually

13
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,760
commanded the SEAL teams three task unit bruiser that fought in the battle against the Iraqi

14
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:44,560
insurgents in Ramadi, and was honored with the Silver Star and Bronze Star for his service.

15
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,960
He achieved the rank of Lieutenant Commander. Good to see you again, Jaco.

16
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:58,800
It's good to be here. Yeah, I feel the same way that it's good to be here. I'm really looking

17
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:06,880
forward to our conversation. I'm glad that you were able to gut through that ridiculously long bio,

18
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:13,600
and I felt that as you got to the end of it, you are breaking free of the chains of that reading.

19
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:19,280
So I'm glad it's over with. Yeah, well, it's so much better just to talk than to read in this sort

20
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,080
of format, but at least everybody who doesn't know already has some sense of who you are, some

21
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:34,400
minimal sense of who you are. So tell me what's been happening online with you over the last

22
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,880
couple of years, because we haven't spoken, I would say it's got to be two years, I think,

23
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:47,840
something like that. And so I've cast an eye on what's been happening with you on YouTube, and

24
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,600
some of my staff have filled me in, but I'm really curious. Tell me about what's happening with your

25
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:00,480
YouTube channel and your online activities, your podcast and all of that. Yeah, a few years ago,

26
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,560
I started a podcast. That was actually, it was quite a few years ago now, it was in 2015.

27
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,520
It might have been kind of as the explosion of prior to the explosion of podcasts. In fact,

28
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:19,360
I think I read something that said, at that time, it was like 17% of Americans were listening to

29
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:27,120
podcasts and that number is much, much higher now. And I kind of got lucky because at the time,

30
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,000
Tim Ferriss had one of the most popular, still very popular, but at the time,

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,520
just because the numbers of podcasts that existed, his podcast was even more popular.

32
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:44,640
And I went on his podcast and when we got done recording and he pressed stop on the record

33
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,880
button, he looked at me and said, you should have your own podcast. And I kind of took that

34
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,920
and noted it. And then a little while later, I was on Joe Rogan's podcast and he had,

35
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,120
you know, obviously another one of the most popular podcasts in the world.

36
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,960
And he told me in the middle of that podcast that I should have my own podcast.

37
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,360
And so when guys like Tim Ferriss and Joe Rogan are telling you to have your own podcast,

38
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,160
you have your own podcast. Now, I came to realize later that Joe Rogan actually would tell everybody

39
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,280
to have a podcast. So maybe he would tell everyone, oh, you should start a podcast. Well,

40
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:27,200
I actually listened to him. And so I started that podcast. And I would say I probably, if

41
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,560
somebody would have asked, you know, what should a person do to make a good podcast or

42
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,880
maybe not a good podcast, but a popular podcast, somebody would probably say,

43
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,840
make it probably a half an hour to an hour, bring a bunch of different guests on so that you can

44
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,000
hear a bunch of deep bunch of different people talking and, you know, talk about positive things

45
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,640
in the world. And so instead of doing any of that, what I did was I have a podcast that's between

46
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:03,600
two and five hours long. Oftentimes it's just me talking, reading from a book and reviewing a book.

47
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,920
And usually the books are about war or suffering or some kind of human atrocity.

48
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,760
And so that's what my podcast is. And really what it boils down to is it's

49
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,880
learning about human nature. And for me, human nature is best revealed or most clearly revealed

50
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,280
in times of suffering. And one of the, I guess, pretty good monopoly on the market for suffering

51
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:34,000
is war and right in there as well as, you know, human atrocities. So I started that podcast.

52
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,640
And like I said, when I started it, there weren't that many, there weren't as many as podcasts as

53
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:45,760
there are now. So it got some traction out of the gate and it kind of just stayed there.

54
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,480
So I was very lucky in that respect. And I've been doing ever since I've,

55
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:58,480
I've put out one podcast a week for five years. I've only missed one, one week in there. And

56
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,240
that was when my best friend was killed in a parachute accident. And so I didn't put out a

57
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:12,160
podcast that week. But other than that, I've been very consistent. And then the YouTube channel is,

58
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,880
well, it's, it's kind of the podcast. And then we do some excerpts there and little clips and

59
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,480
stuff like that. And Echo Charles, I forget what you called him in the bio, a Brazilian jiu-jitsu

60
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:33,520
practitioner. He's also a video guy. And so he makes his little, he makes little clips and puts

61
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,800
special effects in them and stuff because he's creative and bored, which means

62
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,080
it's a great combination for someone that you're, that you're working with.

63
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,760
It is indeed. So I think that's what's been happening online for me and for the past few years.

64
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,160
Who, who do you, who's your audience? Do you think, or do you know?

65
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:02,480
Yeah, I know actually quite well that my, my demographic is people. It's people, it's human

66
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,280
beings. Really, it's, it's all over the place. And when I go and do live events, I'll have

67
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,400
just the entire spectrum of humans there. Hey, look, is there a, is there a,

68
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,280
you know, kind of a typical person? Yeah, there's a typical person, but we get everybody on the

69
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,760
spectrum from the grandma to the, the little kids, you know, I've written a bunch of kids' books

70
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,400
and the little kids show up as well. Right. Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty kids' books.

71
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,240
Yeah, pretty broad demographic. That's, I meet all kinds of people. Everybody from a,

72
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:40,640
I'll meet a firefighter and then a hedge fund guy and then a stay at home mom and then a retired

73
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,920
Marine. It just meet everybody. It's, and that's the audience.

74
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,440
Do you, do you have any sense of what it is that's attracting people to your podcast? I mean,

75
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,680
you, you, you sort of approached that tongue and cheek in some sense for, for a dark topic,

76
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,480
you know, you concentrate on things that are, that are pretty negative or they're pretty dark.

77
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:06,240
And so as you said, that might fly in the face of any advice you'd get about what to talk about.

78
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,640
But obviously, I mean, one of the things I've encountered is that there's a very,

79
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:16,240
there's a vast hunger for serious dialogue. And I mean, one of the things that struck me

80
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,640
always about your podcast was you often read something that's very, very

81
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:28,400
emotionally demanding, stark, harsh, rough. And

82
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,520
well, and it's interesting to think about why people might

83
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,400
be attracted to that. What's your sense? And also, why are you doing it?

84
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:54,080
I think that it's emotional. I think that these are emotional topics.

85
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,400
I think these are things that people can be a little bit afraid of and a little bit nervous

86
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,280
about and being able to brush up against them a little bit gives them a little bit more

87
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,360
familiarity with them. And therefore, when you see, when you come close to things that are

88
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,760
that stark and dark and horrible, it also makes you look up around at the present situation

89
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,720
that you're in and maybe it doesn't look as awful. Yeah, so.

90
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,520
So there you touched on two things about knowing something about history that might be really

91
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:32,640
useful or about human affairs, right? One is that, I mean, it's a tenant of clinical psychotherapy

92
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:40,400
that a voluntary approach to what's frightening, threatening, even disgusting is curative. It has

93
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,600
to be voluntary. And it can't be too intense, right? Because if it gets too intense, it can

94
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,960
actually hurt you. But if it's voluntary and measured, that actually seems to strengthen

95
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:56,480
people, it develops resilience. And I would say that's one thing that virtually all well-trained

96
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:04,400
clinicians agree on is that that kind of exposure, whether it's discussing old difficult experiences

97
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,480
in an autobiographical manner, or whether it's actually going out into the world and

98
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,920
facing things that you're afraid of, if you're an elevator phobic, for example, you might be faced

99
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,240
with confronted with the necessity of at least looking at an elevator, which is something you

100
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,480
might avoid if you're phobic. And then so that's the first thing. So there is some pronounced human

101
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:33,120
tendency to be attracted to what's dark, because that is a pathway to mental and physical resilience.

102
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,720
And then the second thing is, which I also think is extremely important is

103
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:45,280
it's useful to cultivate gratitude in my estimation. And one of the ways that you can do that, because

104
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:50,640
you take a lot of what's good in your life for granted, it gets invisible, especially if it's

105
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,680
predictable, it gets invisible. And that's unfortunate, because it's still rare and precious.

106
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:05,120
And if you know how terrible things can be, have been or could become, then that can alert you

107
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,040
to how fortunate you are when all hell isn't breaking loose right now, everywhere in your life.

108
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:21,440
So, yeah, and you can also sort of learn some skill sets of how to handle these tough situations

109
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,520
when you get in them. And if you can see that someone went through something that's much worse,

110
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,960
and what did they do to deal with it? How did they get through it? What did they think about?

111
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,000
What did they do? You can say, okay, well, I've seen that before. And the situation,

112
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:42,320
amen, isn't quite as bad. But I know that that person took action. I know that person stood up

113
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,960
and made a move and made things happen and tried to move forward. And maybe that's what I should

114
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:55,280
do too. So you can definitely garner some skills from the past. Right. So that's a third element,

115
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:02,240
is that it can expand your notion of human competence. And that's, I think that's partly,

116
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,000
that's one of the reasons that people love watching high end sports performances.

117
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,840
Because you think, well, look, that's what a human being is capable of. Isn't that

118
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:21,760
so remarkable? And I am one of those. And so that's a limit case. But there's obviously room

119
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,960
for me to develop. And that's something that's very hopeful. And so if you are in dire straits and

120
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,840
you've seen that other people can get through that, you think, well, maybe I could get through that

121
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:38,000
if I could just learn how to do it. So I had a guy on my podcast who had written a book. His name

122
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:46,080
was William Reeder. And he had, he was a helicopter pilot in Vietnam. And he was shot down. Well,

123
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,200
he shot down two times. The first time he was shot down, he was able to make it back to friendly

124
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,640
lines. The second time he was shot down, he was captured. And he was captured in South Vietnam,

125
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,520
which is actually worse. You didn't want to get captured in South Vietnam, because then they

126
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,640
had to get you to North Vietnam to the prison. And getting to North Vietnam while you're patrolling

127
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:13,920
through the jungle for months on end is not a good thing. And at one point, he's in a two foot

128
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:23,920
tall bamboo cage in the jungle. And his legs are shackled. And it's nighttime. And he's trying to

129
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:31,040
sleep, but he's having trouble sleeping because the rats are gnawing at the wounds on his legs.

130
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:43,920
And so knowing that someone could suffer through that and survive and get through and make it out

131
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:52,960
the other side and then carry on with a completely productive life tells me that we are pretty resilient

132
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,200
as a species if we can dig deep and find that resiliency.

133
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:04,320
Yes. Well, that's exactly the kind of story that also makes you much appreciative of the fact that

134
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,960
you have a bed in an air conditioned room that in a house in a town that's not burning to the

135
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:17,200
ground with rioters. And you have that every night. And so you take it for granted, but

136
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,120
but it's still worth noting that it's a kind of miracle compared to all the alternatives that might

137
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,280
manifest themselves. Yeah, I think people appreciate that. I think people, you know, look, how many

138
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,680
movies have been made about war, countless movies have been made about war, countless books have

139
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,640
been written about war. So human beings are definitely have some sort of a, I don't know if

140
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:46,240
it's a fascination or at least an appreciation for the sacrifice and the effort that goes into

141
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:55,920
fighting a war. And I will tell you, and I can't speak for everybody, but certainly me and the

142
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,320
kids I, many of the kids I grew up with, and then many of the people that I served with,

143
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,560
that's what we wanted to do. We had some kind, I had some kind of an instinct. That's such a great

144
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:15,120
thing for you to be able to say, you know, because there's there, I remember watching this kid once

145
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,360
I saw him in Montreal, and he was standing, he's a big kid, about six, five, I would think, and

146
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,560
he was wearing these punk boots that were like military knockoffs, essentially. And

147
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,800
he was standing there, he's about 17 or 18, and he's standing there on the corner of this outdoor

148
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,640
shopping mall carrying these two pink shopping bags and looking completely out of place. And I

149
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:40,320
thought, you know, if you went there and offered that kid a chance to go off and have an adventure,

150
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,680
you know, to have a battle, he dropped those shopping bags and be gone in two seconds because

151
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,400
he wants something more than to be, he's not built for that. It was so incongruous, you know,

152
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:56,320
he wasn't built for that. And William James, the American philosopher, said that we needed a moral

153
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:05,280
equivalent to war, because war calls people to extremes, right, to the extremes in their life.

154
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,080
And there's something about that that was obviously compelling, as you, as you say,

155
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,920
it's uncomfortable as well to, to, to state that blatantly, because obviously peace is a

156
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,920
desirable condition. But the question is then, well, how do you put sufficient adventure into the

157
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,960
peace? And that's a very, very, that's a very complicated problem.

158
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:41,360
Yeah, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's very true in the fact that in war, I was lucky enough

159
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:49,520
to go and I was lucky enough to serve in, in combat and to be in a position of leadership in

160
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:58,720
combat. And in those situations, I was able to witness with my own eyes, on the one hand,

161
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:07,280
the most heinous and despicable acts that human beings can partake in. And I was also able to

162
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:14,960
witness with my own two eyes, these soldiers, Marines, the guys that were in my task unit,

163
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:23,680
making the most incredible sacrifices for their friends. So yes, there is an extreme

164
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:30,480
to war. And like you said, it's not something you wish on anybody. And I had this conversation

165
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,080
with Sam Harris a while ago, because he called me out and said, you know, you're talking about how

166
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,120
hard war is, and it's terrible. But at the same time, you say it's the best thing that you have

167
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:47,440
been through. And I, I asked him if he'd ever known anyone that had cancer and survived it.

168
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:55,200
And oftentimes those people will say, it's the best thing that happened to me. I wouldn't wish it

169
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,640
on anybody, but I'm glad it happened to me. And that's kind of how I feel about war too. I wouldn't

170
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,840
wish war on anybody, but I am, I wouldn't, I wouldn't trade it for anything.

171
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:17,040
So when you look, when you look back on your involvement in the war in Iraq and your country's

172
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:24,240
involvement, what, what do you make? How do you make sense out of it morally? I mean, we're in

173
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,880
that domain right now, you know, you tell, tell me already that you're pulled between these extreme

174
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,400
views. You don't wish war on anyone. I'm, I mean, if you have, do you have a son?

175
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,320
Yes. How old is he? 18.

176
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:49,200
Well, so, so then you think I presume, but I, or perhaps I wouldn't, I wouldn't deign to presume

177
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,960
if you could have what you wanted for him. Would that be peace?

178
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,440
Of course. Okay. Okay. Well, that, right. Well, okay. So, so let's have a little bit.

179
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:13,600
Of course, of course, but. Well, right. Right. Exactly. Well, the other thing,

180
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,000
the other thing that you do as far as please correct me if I get any of this wrong, but

181
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,840
I mean, part of what you're also offering to people is the, is the call of a kind of radical

182
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:32,160
discipline. Right. Now you post on Instagram, your, the times you wake up in the morning,

183
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:43,120
correct? Yes. 430, something like that. And pretty regularly. And I guess you do that to show people

184
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:52,080
that you can get the hell out of bed at 430 and get your day going. And. Yeah, maybe not. I would

185
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:58,640
love to tell you that I was that, um, had that much for forethought into when I started doing that,

186
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,560
but I was on Tim Ferriss's podcast and he told me I should join Twitter. And I kind of said,

187
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,880
what's that? And he showed it to me a little bit and he said, you really should join this. It's a

188
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,000
way you can communicate with people. And I said, okay, fair enough. So I signed up for Twitter and

189
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:20,400
whatever the next day I woke up in the morning and didn't know what to write or what to do.

190
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,200
So I just took a picture of my watch and, you know, here I go. And other people kind of noticed

191
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:32,240
that. And so that's kind of how that whole thing started. But yeah, well, it's not, it's not always

192
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,960
the case that when you do something new and creative, you know, why you do it. I mean,

193
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,680
sometimes you have, you've, and even if you think you know why you do it, you might find out five

194
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,680
years later that there were 10 other reasons that you did it that you weren't aware of at the time.

195
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:51,520
Like we live beyond ourselves all the time. That's especially true if you're entrepreneurial and

196
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,960
creative because you're changing who you are all the time. And there's no reason to assume

197
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:05,040
that your understanding of yourself would keep up with the changes. So my take on the Instagram

198
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:10,640
posts was, well, what I just, what I just mentioned, it's like, well, you know, yeah, you can sleep

199
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,560
until 10 o'clock in the morning if you want, but you can also get a jump on the day. And

200
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:19,520
I think part of what makes your, I think part of what makes what you're doing attractive

201
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:26,720
is that there's so little emphasis in our popular culture, especially, especially with regards to

202
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:33,040
the so-called mainstream media on discipline and responsibility, that there's a tremendous

203
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:39,520
hunger for anything that pertains to that. And you have a right to be discussing that, I would say,

204
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,840
because of your, because of your background, which if nothing else required a tremendous

205
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:51,760
amount of discipline. Yeah. And I ended up writing a book called Discipline Equals Freedom.

206
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,400
And I'm lucky that I wrote it when I did, because if I would have written it two years later,

207
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,600
everyone would have said, oh, everyone's talking about discipline now. So yeah, discipline,

208
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,680
absolutely. Discipline does bring you freedom in life. And that's something that I kind of

209
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,960
figured out over time. Well, so what do you mean by that? Like, how did you figure that out? And

210
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,640
what do you mean by that? Because they're often, and you know, the classic sort of, what would you

211
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:25,840
call it, romantic rebel is someone who has, is free from excessive order, let's say. They don't see,

212
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:33,280
they see freedom and discipline as antithetical rather than seeing one as a precondition for the

213
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:41,440
other. And so, so how did you learn that discipline was a precondition for freedom? If I've, if I've

214
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:48,720
got the equation, how did that manifest itself in your own life? So we'll start off by saying this,

215
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,920
and look, I was a young kid, I joined the Navy to go in the SEAL teams, I went through SEAL training,

216
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:59,360
I showed up at a SEAL team, SEAL team one. And when I got there, and as I look back,

217
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:08,000
this is a very powerful thing, even though it's very simple. When I was, so I'm 19 years old when

218
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:16,080
I show up at SEAL team one, I'm done with the basic SEAL training. And I have a goal in my head,

219
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:25,520
which is that, which is this, I want to be a good SEAL. That's what I want to do. That's like,

220
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,040
I don't know about anything else. This is what I want to do. I want to be a good SEAL. That's

221
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:39,200
what I want. I want to be a good SEAL. And so as a 19 year old with all kinds of energy, and we

222
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,280
haven't talked about my childhood yet, but I was kind of like a very rebellious kid when you talked

223
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:49,280
about seeing a kid that looked like you could have handed him a club or a battle axe, and he

224
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,280
would have probably been feeling a little bit better. I was like that. I was constantly looking

225
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,720
around for a club or a battle axe, because that's what I felt like I needed to do. And it was beautiful

226
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:05,040
because I was running around the, running around the woods as a young kid playing army. And I

227
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,880
just went and actually played army. You know, that's what I ended up doing. So I never really had to

228
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,640
do, do, you know, force myself into some mold that I didn't want to be into. So I got to SEAL team

229
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:23,760
one. And now I just want to be a good SEAL. That's what I want. And so now that starts steering some

230
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:30,640
of my decisions. And for the most part, it steered my decisions in a decent direction. Now there were

231
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:38,400
sometimes where as I look back now, what I thought was a good SEAL was a little bit off, but luckily

232
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,120
it wasn't 180 degrees off. It might have been 30 degrees or 40 degrees. And as I got older and more

233
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,800
mature and I figured out more about what that ideal should look like to me. And I could keep

234
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:55,760
chasing that ideal. That was good. But even to be even to be a 19 year old kid with a with a 70

235
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:03,840
or 80 degree corridor to move forward in is not a bad thing. No, it's a gift. It's a gift. Exactly.

236
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:12,480
So then I'm looking around at other SEALs that were older than me and more senior to me and trying

237
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:19,360
to figure out which one of those guys is a good SEAL. Yeah. And what I realized was that the guys

238
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:25,520
that were working harder, for the most part, were good SEALs. Now there were, look, there's just

239
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,360
some people that are just way talented. Right. It could show up, you know, three minutes before a run

240
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,160
or three minutes before we do a shooting competition, and they could just walk through it. No problem.

241
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:41,760
Right. And that's great for them. It wasn't me. I wasn't, I'm not that great at anything.

242
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,400
But I saw other guys that might not be a great at anything either, but they worked hard.

243
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,320
They showed up to work early. They did the drills that they were supposed to do.

244
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:57,120
They had discipline. And when you have a SEAL has amalgamated statistics. I hope I get this right,

245
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:04,880
but it's approximately correct. If you work 10% longer hours, you make 40% more money.

246
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,480
Right. And so and I think your comments about talent are also dead on. It's like,

247
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,000
in any field of enterprise, there are people who are phenomenally gifted.

248
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,920
And, and then if they work really hard, they're even more phenomenally gifted. Right. Those are

249
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:29,920
the people who break records. But that talent apart, hard work actually works. And with virtually

250
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:35,440
everything, it might not make you the best at whatever it is you're pursuing, but it will

251
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,120
certainly make you better than you are. And, and then I have in this, I have this new book.

252
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,400
I hope you got a copy because we, did you get a copy? Okay. So I'm bringing it up for a particular

253
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,840
reason. I have a chapter in this book called, well, there's two that are relevant. Imagine who

254
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,360
you could be and then aim single-mindedly at that. That's one. And then the course, or what would

255
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:04,880
you call it? A complimentary chapter is work as hard as you possibly can on one thing and see

256
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,680
what happens. And that's also predicated on this idea that discipline is a precondition to freedom.

257
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,960
So, so you were fortunate like you had this goal, right? So that meant you had a goal,

258
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,200
which is a really big deal, because you could learn about goals. You had a sense of

259
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,240
what a higher mode of moral being that I would rather be a good seal than the person I am now.

260
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,040
Well, it's a, it's a code of behavior and a way of perceiving. So there's an ethic in that. And

261
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:37,360
then you said as well, you know, your conception of what good seal meant changed as you matured.

262
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,320
But that's also fine. It wouldn't have changed unless you would have pursued that initial

263
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:48,240
only partially accurate goal. And so that's also a really good thing for people to understand is like,

264
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:55,200
if you don't know what you're doing, aim at something. Is it the right thing? No. But it's

265
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,920
better than just shooting randomly. So you aim at something and then as you aim and you move towards

266
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:06,240
it, you're going to find out why you're wrong. And then you might recalibrate your aim. And that's

267
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,800
going to happen over and over because as you move towards a goal, it recedes or it broadens or it

268
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:16,880
recedes and broadens. And otherwise you'd run out of things to do. So, but anyways, back to the,

269
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,560
back to the story, you're, you, you have this, this, this identity and you said it was, it was

270
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:27,360
there in you all right from the beginning, because you would play army in, in the, by yourself even

271
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:32,160
in the, in the, in the forest by your house, I presume. And how, how old were you? Do you think

272
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:41,680
when, how long back can you remember having that as a fascination? I do not remember wanting to do

273
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:52,080
anything else. So would you say what is as early, is that as early as four, three,

274
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,000
five preschool, something like that? Can you remember playing when you were that young?

275
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:05,920
I, I can't remember, you know, a specific age, but if I think back to, hey,

276
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,080
that looks like what I want to do. I remember, I want to be a soldier.

277
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,120
And do you, okay, you remember when you were a kid? I mean, I'm fascinated by this because

278
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,560
one of the things I really noted when I had kids was how much their personality was there

279
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,960
right from the beginning. Like my children are quite different. They have their similarities,

280
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,960
but they're quite different from one another. And those differences were there right from the

281
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,320
beginning and they've maintained themselves throughout their lives. And so it's fascinating to

282
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:42,000
see that, that destiny in some sense is built right into the person to begin with. And so,

283
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,760
while this was built into you by all appearances, and so it manifested it in itself in what attracted

284
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:55,120
you even in play as a, as a child. And that's the beginning of identity formulation, that, that

285
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:01,200
play. And so what was it about being a soldier that you think attracted you when you were a kid?

286
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,080
Like what, what was it that was so compelling? Because being a soldier is a multi-dimensional

287
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,840
identity. There's, there's, there's the, the, the physical combat element of it. There's the

288
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:18,320
strategic element of it. There's the, the discipline, the camaraderie. What, what were you playing,

289
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:25,360
do you think? I got asked this, I was talking to some folks at the special operations command

290
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:31,040
the other day and they asked me, they set me up with this kind of beautiful

291
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,920
possibility or opportunity for me to give some kind of an incredibly beautiful

292
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:43,360
answer to this very question, you know, and there was something along the lines of,

293
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:51,120
you know, at what point did the, did the opportunity to serve and sacrifice for your country

294
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:57,600
reveal itself to you or something along that, those lines. And all I'm thinking about is when I'm

295
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:04,480
eight years old, 12 years old, 15 years old, I want a machine gun and I want to go fight

296
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,400
in a war. That's what I want to do. I would love to tell you, I would love to tell you that I,

297
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:15,280
you know, read some heroic book. I read the odyssey and, and realized that I don't need to

298
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,840
read any of that stuff. Well, that wouldn't be wrong to do with eight anyways, right? I mean,

299
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,960
that's why I'm curious about what it was so early, you know, and so, okay, so for you,

300
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,840
it had something to do with weaponry, apparently, I got to tell you a story about my father, okay,

301
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,280
and tell me if this act, we like produces any echoes before you go. Yep.

302
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,640
Weaponry was like, for sure, that's fine, but it could be a club. It wasn't, it wasn't, I wasn't

303
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:49,200
a kid that was obsessed with guns. Okay. It was, and maybe it was just we're going to get out and,

304
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,720
and run around with sticks and try and hit each other or get into rock fights.

305
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:01,280
Do you ever have rock fights? Well, we, we had ice fights, because it was northern Alberta,

306
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:06,000
but also dirt lump fights. And now and then those would have rocks. And I can remember,

307
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,240
it was usually the Protestant kids against the Catholic kids. I mean, there wasn't that much

308
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,360
of a division between those two in our town, but the Catholic kids had their junior high and high

309
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:24,400
school and we had ours. And so our gangs were separate. And so we would have dirt lump fights

310
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,960
in the vacant lots where buildings were being constructed. And those were extremely exciting.

311
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,960
You know, now, and then you'd take a dirt lump rock in the mouth and that was a little bit on

312
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,960
the painful side. And, but, but, but there's no doubt that it was extremely exciting. And so,

313
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:44,080
and, you know, I cut you off about your dad and the gun. Well, my dad told me something,

314
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:50,320
and then this might be more relevant to, to, to guns, but my dad collects single shot rifles.

315
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,920
And he has a lot of them, like hundreds of them. And he's a gunsmith and, and makes stalks and

316
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,560
hand carves them. And anyways, he's, he's an artisan in that regard. And it's really, it's a,

317
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,640
it's a real focal obsession. He's a great shot. He shot at the provincial level,

318
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:13,200
which would be the state level in the US. But it was single shots and, and he hunted. And so we

319
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,760
grew up on moose meat and elk meat. And, and he brought elk into Northern Alberta as part of a

320
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:25,520
repopulation attempt. Anyways, I thought for, I could never understand his fascination with,

321
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,400
with guns, because it was really a deep fascination. So it was, it was something that

322
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:37,600
elicited my curiosity. And at one point I realized that he only hunted with single shots.

323
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:43,680
So he had one shot at whatever he was hunting. So it had to be a good shot. And so he was pushing

324
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:49,200
himself. And then I realized, well, he was really obsessed with hitting the target, taking aim

325
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:55,040
and hitting the target. And it was about that time I learned that the Greek word for, for sin,

326
00:33:55,040 --> 00:34:01,760
hamartia meant to miss the target. So there's this tight alignment between taking careful aim

327
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:07,840
at the center of something precisely, and then bringing yourself into alignment so that you would

328
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:13,280
hit that target. There's a deep morality in that. It's a morality of hunting. It might be a

329
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:19,120
morality of combat. And it's really deeply embedded inside of people. And that was what had my father

330
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:27,120
in its grip. And so I would, I was wondering if the, if, if you're, if you're

331
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:36,000
the automatic interest that, that even the club elicited in you had something to do with that,

332
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,680
that seeking, that hunting, that, that target seeking, or if, you know, perhaps I'm barking up

333
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:50,640
the wrong tree, I would say. No, but when you, when you were talking about getting hit in the

334
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:56,800
head with a dirt clump and whether you get hit or not, when you get done with that situation,

335
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:06,160
you are in an elevated state of mind because that was dangerous. And it was a very high level

336
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:12,960
competition. Because even when you're throwing a baseball or, or, you know, kicking a soccer ball

337
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:20,560
around, there's no real danger in that situation. But when someone's hucking dirt clumps at your head,

338
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:30,240
you get a legitimate rush from that. And it feels good. And it feels it's exhilarating. One of the

339
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,240
most fun, yes, if there's no doubt that it's exhilarating, one of the most fun days I ever

340
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:44,080
had as a child, this was less dangerous. I lived next door to a policeman, an RCMP officer. And

341
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:52,320
we went out one day, I was probably about eight into my neighbor's backyard. And she had green

342
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,680
tomatoes everywhere, far more than she was ever going to eat. And we had a green tomato war

343
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:03,360
for like an hour and a half. And he was moving them at a pretty good velocity. So if they caught you,

344
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:11,040
especially in the head, you know, you kind of remembered it. But it was exhilarating. And it

345
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,480
was really fun to engage in that with him. And I really do remember that. And I do remember those,

346
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:22,400
I hadn't until today, but I do remember those dirt lump wars. And there is an exhilaration in

347
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,080
pushing yourself like that. So. And I also don't, I don't want to give the impression that I was,

348
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,480
you know, running around with camouflage paint going to high school, or I was, you know, I was

349
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,160
doing a bunch of other stuff too. I played soccer, I played basketball. I, we had, you know, a bunch

350
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,680
of different bands, we played music, I played bass in a band, I sang in a band, I played guitar.

351
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:52,320
We did all kinds of other stuff. But I was always kind of just in the back of my mind sort of

352
00:36:52,560 --> 00:37:02,080
wanted to do that job. All right. So you went to the seals. And tell us about that a bit.

353
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:15,440
It was awesome. You know, it's your, you're making more money than you could ever figure out to do

354
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:21,360
with, you know, I'm 19 years old, and I am the richest person that's ever existed in my mind,

355
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:28,240
because I'm making whatever it is, however many thousand dollars every two weeks. And you know,

356
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:34,640
my expenses were nothing. And so you're just totally stoked. You're getting, you got a great job.

357
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,520
You're working out, you're shooting machine guns, you're blowing things up, you're hanging out with

358
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:45,680
a bunch of, bunch of other guys that like to blow things up and you, you, you can fight each other

359
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,400
at the drop of a hat. And then you get done with a fight and you shake hands and then, and then you

360
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:58,720
go eat a steak. And so you're just in this environment and it's perfect. It's, it's freaking

361
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:06,160
awesome. So what was it like? It was awesome. That's what it was like. It's funny. You read

362
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:12,400
accounts of the Navy SEALs and I've never read it as enthusiastic an account as that account right

363
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,680
there. And so then how long after you, what happened after you were done your Naval SEAL,

364
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,440
Naval SEAL training? What, what direction did your military career take?

365
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,280
Yes. So I got done with SEAL training. I went to SEAL team one. It was 1991. I just

366
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,720
missed the first golf war. I was all brokenhearted about that because this war had happened and I

367
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:37,760
didn't know when another one was going to happen. And so what do you do is you train and, and we

368
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:43,920
trained a bunch. I did a bunch of SEAL platoons, which is you form up with a group of guys, you

369
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,040
do a training cycle together as a platoon and then you go on deployment overseas. And when

370
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,920
there's no war going on, you go to other countries and you work with foreign nationals and you train

371
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,520
them on the skill sets that we have and learn some stuff from them. And then you come back and you do

372
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:05,760
it again. And then eventually from there, I went into a, where I became a trainer at SEAL team one

373
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,160
and taught the tactics to the SEAL platoons that were now training to go on deployment.

374
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,320
And I did that for a couple of years. And then I got picked up for a commissioning program

375
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,400
and became an officer in the SEAL teams, which moved me up into a leadership position.

376
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:26,400
And then I did a couple of deployments as a young SEAL leader. Then I had to go to college. The

377
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,800
Navy sent me to college because in order to be an officer in the, in the Navy, you have to go to

378
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,120
college and I hadn't been to college. So I went to the University of San Diego.

379
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,160
You went to the University of San Diego. What did you take there?

380
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,400
I, I was an English major.

381
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,280
All right. So you finished college and then what happened?

382
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,760
You're not going to ask me why I was an English major?

383
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,240
Why were you an English major?

384
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,080
I thought when he hears English major, he's going to say, wait a second,

385
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,360
here you are, this guy talking about machine guns and blowing things up.

386
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,520
What in God's name are you going to go study English for?

387
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,720
I have to say that that thought did pass through my mind.

388
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,960
Okay. Why was I an English major? I was an English major because believe it or not,

389
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,520
when you're in the SEAL teams and especially when you're in any officer position,

390
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:21,920
you have to write and read all the time. So when one of your troops does something and

391
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,160
they deserve some kind of recognition for that, you have to write them an award.

392
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,040
And if the award is written well, there's a much better chance that it'll actually

393
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,480
that be given to the person that you're writing it for.

394
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,440
You have to write evaluations for your troops and the evaluations that you write

395
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,000
is how your troops are judged so that they can be promoted.

396
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:49,520
On top of that, if you want to go do a mission, you have to write a concept of operations,

397
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,640
which is a document, which is five, six, seven, eight pages long,

398
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,280
that you send up the chain of command that then they scour through and see if they're

399
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,640
going to prove your mission or not. That's so insanely important.

400
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:13,600
One of the things, I did a talk at Harvard four years ago and I pointed out two things to the

401
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:21,680
students in the audience. One was that a tremendous amount of civilization and effort had gone into

402
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:27,760
producing the institution that they were now part of and that everyone who was part of that

403
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,560
institution was hoping that they would come there and learn everything they possibly could

404
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,960
that was relevant and important and that they would be the best possible people they could be

405
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,120
and they would go out in the world and do as much good as they possibly could.

406
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:46,800
That was the essential mission of the enterprise and that was really the case.

407
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:55,120
Also, that learning to write in particular was going to make them more powerful than they could

408
00:41:55,120 --> 00:42:01,280
imagine and a number of students came up to me afterwards and said, I really wish someone would

409
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,720
have said that to us when we first came here. It's the writing part of that. I kind of got

410
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:12,480
obsessed with that when I was working as a professor and I'm working on a piece of software right now

411
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:19,600
to help, which we'll launch soon, to help people write because what I observed in my own career

412
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:24,320
and it's so interesting, the parallelism is so interesting but not surprising, is that

413
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,840
nothing can stop you if you can write and it's for the reasons you just laid out. It's like

414
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,480
when you write, you make a case for something, whatever it happens to be and if you make the

415
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,960
best case, well then you win and you get whatever it is that you're aiming at and so

416
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,880
you said maybe that's why I didn't ask you why you went into English. I guess that might have

417
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:54,160
been the reason is that the utility of learning to write is so self-evident to me that it could

418
00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:00,320
pass by without question but it's also interesting to think about how it fits into this broader,

419
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:05,920
well let's say at least partially military slash strategic way of looking at things.

420
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:12,800
You describe the intense relationship between marshalling your arguments properly,

421
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:19,680
getting everything in order on the page and making strategic progress truly in the military sense

422
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:24,400
that those things are tied together very, very precisely and it's obviously your ability to

423
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,920
communicate as well that's, well look what it's done. You have your podcast, you have your YouTube

424
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,360
channel, you have your books which many of which you self-published so that ability to communicate

425
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:41,920
is it's, I just can't understand why it's not presented especially, not entirely but especially

426
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,200
to adventurous, well let's say young men, we could say young people. You're adventurous,

427
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,200
you want to make a mark, is you bloody well better learn how to write because if you learn how to

428
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,440
write well then you can think and you can communicate your thoughts so not only are you

429
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,640
deadly strategically, you become extremely convincing and then you can go and do anything

430
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:11,280
you want and no one will stop you and that's never told to people and I don't really understand why.

431
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,240
You know you hear the pen is mightier than the sword which is just a cliche unless it's fleshed

432
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:22,720
out but the reason, you laid out the reasons perfectly. You have to communicate what happened

433
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:30,080
as well as having it had it happen. Right so you already connected the dots but obviously

434
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:36,640
not only am I having to write and present my argument, I'm also having orders being issued to

435
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:42,800
me which are written. I'm sure you've heard the term rules of engagement, well rules of engagement

436
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:52,160
is a 12 page document that is in a bunch of legalese and I've got to translate that document

437
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:58,880
to my troops some of whom you know barely graduated high school and so I've got to be

438
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,760
able to do that so I've got to be able to read and then write and be able to then communicate

439
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:09,680
and talk to the team and brief them in a manner that they can actually understand what it is

440
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:15,920
I'm talking about and what it is our mission is and why we're doing this mission so that was why I

441
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:23,200
decided to study English when I went to college and so that was a conscious decision

442
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:29,360
absolutely and with that end in mind that it was so tell me exactly what the decision was

443
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:36,160
with regards to studying English what did you know that because it's not as you pointed out

444
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:41,200
it's not self-evidently the most practical of pursuits and not necessarily what you'd expect

445
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,760
someone with a military orientation to pursue right here's the here's the thought process

446
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:54,880
I want to be a good seal the good seals that I see can communicate they can write and they can read

447
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,600
that's what I need to learn how to do I need to learn how to do that better so that I can

448
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,360
persuade my chain of command that we need to do this mission or we need this piece of gear

449
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:10,960
or this guy over here needs to get an award or he needs to get promoted all those things

450
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,400
are done by being able to write and communicate properly okay so so let's say you take the example

451
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:27,200
of a seal who's got it all but this literacy okay so what what happens to him compared to someone

452
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:36,720
who has all those skills well if he can't if he can't write well and he's in charge of six guys

453
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:42,080
and one of those guys works hard or does something that deserves to be recognized

454
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:48,560
this is the responsibility of that leader to write that person an award okay so he can't reward his

455
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:53,360
he can't reward his his good workers his good soldiers he can give him a pat on the back but

456
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:58,320
a pat on the back isn't going to get him promoted an award is actually worth some points towards

457
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:03,760
your promotion and the people that are on that board that are giving that reward they're never

458
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,000
going to meet that leader and they're definitely not going to meet that guy there's no there's no

459
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,480
bias it's based on this piece of paper that you hand in you hand in this piece of paper they

460
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:18,000
read the piece of paper and they say award approved or award not approved or you want to do a mission

461
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,400
and you send that up the chain of command and it's the same thing it gets to a certain point

462
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,600
where they're just looking at it and reading and trying to decipher this pile of junk that you've

463
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:33,360
put together and by the way if I'm in charge and Jordan sends me a concept of operations

464
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:38,960
that doesn't make any sense why would I possibly let you go out and execute an operation that I

465
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:46,080
can't even understand what it is you're trying to do so it has a huge impact it has a huge impact

466
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,960
okay well I'm dwelling on this because it's it's upsetting to me I would say that

467
00:47:52,880 --> 00:48:01,520
young people in particular aren't stringently instructed that the ability to that literacy

468
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:07,600
makes them powerful in every way they can possibly imagine except the absolutely immediate

469
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:15,440
and so it's just sad to me that it's not sold in that manner you want to be weak

470
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:22,240
stay illiterate you want to be strong it's like put yourself together physically fair enough man

471
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:28,320
get brave and street smart but then you could add some literacy to that and you're an unstoppable

472
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:36,240
machine so I concur 100% and you know you said being literate makes you powerful and

473
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:42,160
throughout recent history if we're trying to oppress someone what we don't want them to be

474
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:48,320
able to do is read or write or or articulate themselves right well we haven't even talked

475
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:52,880
about reading you know we just talked about writing and fair enough so but obviously you

476
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,920
studied English so you also read and so what's the advantage to that as far as you're concerned

477
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:06,160
practically speaking well obviously there are so many lessons that you can pull out of

478
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:15,120
books and you you can get to a point where nothing really surprises you because you've

479
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:23,040
at least seen some indication of what can unfold through reading so again for me it's

480
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:30,480
very much focused on combat and war but there's there's lessons that you learn and you say oh

481
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:37,040
I've seen that before there's a book it's it is a book called about face which I think the last

482
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:45,520
time you and I talked you were I think you were writing the forward for for the gulag and I was

483
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:51,120
about to write the forward to I don't know if that's your favorite book but I was lucky enough

484
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:55,040
to be able to write the forward for my favorite book which was re-released because I was talking

485
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:01,200
about it all the time and the book is called about the book is called about face and it's

486
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,200
about a guy that was in the Korean War and that he was in the Vietnam War and his name is Colonel

487
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:12,400
David Hackworth but I would read that book when I was on deployment I would read open up that book

488
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:17,120
anywhere and I would read two pages or three pages before I'd go to bed if I was in my bed that night

489
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:22,640
and there were so many lessons that correlated to what I was actually going through and a real

490
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:28,240
obvious example was when he was in Vietnam he's working with the South Vietnamese soldiers and

491
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,960
therefore by proxy the South Vietnamese government and guess what they're all corrupt and they're

492
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,720
not motivated and they don't have the right gear and here we are in Iraq and we're working with

493
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,720
Iraqi soldiers and therefore by proxy we're working with the Iraqi government guess what

494
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:45,440
they're all corrupted they're they're they're not well equipped and how do you how did he deal with

495
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:51,600
it how do we deal with it so there's an example of when you read you can learn and you don't have to

496
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:57,040
you don't have to go through the school of hard knocks you don't have to get punched in the face

497
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:03,200
repeatedly with things that turn out to be situations that other people have absolutely

498
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:13,120
gone through and the amount of the amount of the the the the level of capability increases

499
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:20,240
so much by seeing something one single time well if I see something one time I'm I'm infinitely

500
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:26,560
better than if I'd never seen it before so if it's like those those little puzzles they give

501
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:31,600
you a little puzzle some kind of a mind bender right the mind benders only work on you one time

502
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:36,400
the riddle only works on you one time then you I know the answer to that that's the answer you

503
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:42,560
know you never get fooled by that again so just knowing just seeing it one time you're

504
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:47,760
infinitely better so when you read enough you're capturing all these lessons and and you know what

505
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:56,800
it's I gotta say this it's not just reading it's not just reading and and I learned this

506
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,960
because as I started doing my podcast and many of my podcasts are just me reading books

507
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:11,840
I realized how to read more intently even more intently than I did when I was going to college

508
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:16,480
and I was going to be you know writing a paper about a book and so I'd read it in a certain way

509
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,840
but you even that reading was a little bit detached a little bit detached because you're

510
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:26,800
looking for a theme or you're looking for character development or what have you but

511
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:34,960
when you read to learn about human nature and life you you you detach less and you kind of

512
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:42,080
put yourself in there and you experience it a little bit closer and then when you take a step

513
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:46,160
back you go oh yeah I I know what he was thinking right there because I was right there with him

514
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:54,640
and so there's a certain attitude you kind of have to put yourself into the work and and really

515
00:52:54,720 --> 00:53:00,240
read it with that kind of intensity if for lack of a better word is it is it possible for human

516
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:07,120
being to read intensely because that's what I try and do I get that's no different than than acting

517
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:13,200
intensely or playing intensely of course you want to put the book on you want to become that person

518
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,920
that can rattle you up man especially if the person is thinking all sorts of things that you've

519
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:24,000
never thought I mean I love reading for that reason I could pick my peers too which I really

520
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,280
loved it's like well you know I have these people around me but then there's these people who who've

521
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:35,120
lived before me and in different places and I can set them up on my shelf I can enter into their

522
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:40,960
world and I can benefit from everything they've thought and saturate myself with that person

523
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:46,160
it's and it's very disruptive especially if the person that you're reading has a mind that's more

524
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:51,040
powerful and more well developed than your own I mean Friedrich Nietzsche spun me around for

525
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:58,000
about three years and I was reading Jung at the same time intensely and the same thing you know it

526
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,960
was very disruptive but unbelievably useful unbelievably useful to try on other people

527
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:11,120
like that and you get the benefit of their entire life distilled into their into their book you

528
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:16,960
know it it's 30 years of work I read this one book called the Neuropsychology of Anxiety which

529
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:21,920
is a it's a great scientific work I think it's the greatest neuropsychological work

530
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:28,400
of the last 50 years it's very hard book I think it has 1800 references something like that and

531
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,920
this guy Jeffrey Gray he actually read all those references and he understood them and so it took

532
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:40,400
me six months to read the book but I got an entire education out of it I got to experience in six

533
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:46,400
months what it took him 30 years to learn like what a gift that is it's it's it's unbelievable

534
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:53,120
I was I was listening to an interview with Gary Kasparov I think you said Russian he was a chess

535
00:54:53,120 --> 00:55:00,560
world champion for 20 years something like this and he they asked him anyway the the interviewer

536
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:07,920
didn't ask him directly if he could beat this young young guy named Magnus Carlson who's the

537
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:13,120
current kind of prodigy of chess he's just phenomenal and the highest chess rating ever

538
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:19,280
etc etc and he didn't get asked directly if he could beat him but it was definitely implied

539
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:24,560
if I remember the interview correctly and and it was very interesting to me Gary Kasparov

540
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:30,320
there was two things that I found interesting number one was he said he's younger than me

541
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:35,760
and he didn't mean that and like if that was an advantage for for Gary he meant it he's younger

542
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,640
than me so he has an advantage as an advantage because he's younger and I kind of thought to

543
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:46,160
myself well that's kind of weird because this isn't a physical this isn't a wrestling match this

544
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:53,120
isn't a jujitsu match why would that help and then sure enough you learn a little bit about

545
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:59,200
cognitive decline and Gary Kasparov is 57 years old when he did this interview and and guess what

546
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:05,360
you start well depending on who you are but you start to see cognitive cognitive decline

547
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:12,080
around that time and I'm sure it kicks in at 25 well there you go there's you can IQ is pretty

548
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:19,120
unitary but you can fracture it into crystallized and and fluid and fluid IQ is what enables you to

549
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:26,720
learn and it declines from 25 onward crystallized intelligence continues to grow roughly speaking

550
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:32,240
because it's partly dependent on such things as vocabulary which you can learn and which accumulate

551
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:38,000
but interestingly enough you know you were talking about physically the best way to stave off cognitive

552
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:45,280
decline is not cognitive activity it's exercise weightlifting and cardiovascular exercise can

553
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:51,200
is the it's by far the most potent means of staving off cognitive decline yeah so Kasparov

554
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:56,640
would have the advantage in terms of experience but the younger guy would have the edge on sheer raw

555
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:03,440
brain power that's what I thought too that's what I thought too but guess what it's wrong and it's

556
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:12,320
wrong for the exact reason that you just said so Magnus Carlson when he's 11 years old he gets to

557
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:19,680
open up a book and see every single match and move that Gary Kasparov ever made right that's what they

558
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:25,440
do they document that stuff of course and so what he got to do was what you got to do you got to

559
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:32,000
learn a person's 30 years experience in six months well this young kid so so this where it might have

560
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:38,560
taken Gary Kasparov you know eight years or four years to figure out how to get out of some particular

561
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:44,320
quandary on the chessboard well Magnus just opened to a page in a book and said oh that if I ever get

562
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:50,960
into that quandary I'm there and so what Magnus got to do is he got to start from here right and build

563
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:56,640
and so I make this point from a leadership perspective yeah we can do the same things

564
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:02,960
as as leaders we don't have to figure all this stuff out we can jump up to Gary Kasparov's level

565
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:10,720
or at least get a baseline of what he knew and and win because we learned very interesting to me

566
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:16,080
well you think and again with regards to selling this sort of thing you know I'm stunned that it's

567
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:20,400
possible to make history boring for example people should be so enthralled with history

568
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:26,080
that they can't get enough of it but with reading you imagine you have this opportunity to learn

569
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:34,160
whatever you want from the greatest people who ever lived along that dimension and and

570
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:46,720
well it's stunning to me that that is a hard sell it's mysterious that that it's

571
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:52,800
that that it isn't something that everyone is just clamoring for I mean that to me that points to a

572
00:58:52,800 --> 00:59:00,080
devastating failure inadequacy of the education system a mysterious inadequacy yeah there's a

573
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:07,120
I think maybe the transaction isn't always clear for people I always talk about well if you're

574
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,720
going to sell somebody if you're going to sell somebody a book you know if I'm going to sell

575
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:18,400
you a book Jordan you've got to give me $20 and eight hours of your time right that that's what

576
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,520
you know you're going to give me you're going to give me $20 and you're going to give me

577
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:26,480
eight hours of time which you would probably you know have other things that you might need to do

578
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:30,720
and the transaction is not always clear of what you're going to get out of that especially when

579
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,880
look you can spend a lot of time reading books and not get as much as you might want you might not

580
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:39,920
get your $20 worth out of a book so you have to be somewhat selective now luckily it's not even that

581
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:45,440
hard to figure out which books to read because there's so many reviews and and and history about

582
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:49,920
where these books came from and the and the productivity that they resulted in so but I

583
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:56,640
think it's hard sometimes for look I can I can only speak for myself when I was younger

584
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,800
it was really hard for me to figure out that transaction yeah fair enough like I had a librarian

585
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:12,000
when I was 13 who told me what to read which is what a teacher should do right there's nothing a

586
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,720
teacher can do for you that's better than say well here's 10 books that will change you completely

587
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:22,000
and who actually knows that to be the case one of the things I'd really like to do I I've toyed with

588
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:28,400
well with the whole concept of online education one thing I'd really like to do is to

589
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:35,680
divide up the variety of domains of learning and identify the top 10 books in each domain

590
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:39,440
so to ask an expert it's like well you're a historian you're a great historian

591
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:45,520
what 10 books are crucial and I have a list on my website a list of recommended books there's

592
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:50,640
about 100 of them that have been instrumental for me and lots of people have used that list to

593
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:57,440
purchase books so that's been really good but I'd really like to extend extend and expand it yeah I

594
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:04,080
have the same thing on my website the books from the podcast and same thing all kinds of those books

595
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:09,840
get sold and it's it's beautiful to see but the people that are checking the website or listening

596
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:14,240
to the podcast they know that those books have been through a filter they're there for a reason

597
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:19,440
they're there because they're going to be worth that transaction and I think that's a tough sell for

598
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:24,080
for a lot of people they can't figure out maybe they've invested in books before and they didn't

599
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:28,880
quite get the return on investment that they wanted and buy two or three books and 50 or 60

600
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:34,560
dollars and 20 or 30 hours yeah that's that's a great observation I think because one of the

601
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:41,120
advantages to coming from a literate background is that you do in fact reduce the transaction costs

602
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:45,760
because there's an infinite number of books I mean well no there isn't but as far as we're

603
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:50,480
concerned there might as well be and so the question of what to read really is daunting if you don't

604
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:58,320
know anyone who reads like where do I start and and and how can I not be a fool in doing this so

605
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:05,680
well okay back to English so what what were you reading when you were in university was it was

606
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,680
it fiction novels was it nonfiction what what were you what were you focusing on

607
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:18,080
it was like your basic English literature that's what I studied and so I read everything I read

608
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:22,400
everything you know from each one of the little periods and it took the various classes and and

609
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:30,560
really as trite as this may sound it was actually the the most impact was from Shakespeare there's

610
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:37,360
the most impact on on multiple levels and I'll tell you the primary level and when I've covered

611
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:42,800
Shakespeare on my podcast I explain this to people people think well you know I didn't really

612
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:48,160
understand I read it and understand it and I so I start off when I talk about Shakespeare on my

613
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:55,200
podcast I start off by saying listen if you think you're gonna just pick up Shakespeare open it up

614
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:02,480
and read it and understand it you're not going to because it's barely written in English it's

615
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:06,880
barely written in English it's almost another language and so you're not going to be able to

616
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:13,360
just pick it up and read through it it's it's it's written in an almost other language so what you

617
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:17,600
have to do is you have to start to interpret it and so what I realized with with Shakespeare is

618
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:25,520
number one the weight of the words that these words were so pregnant with meaning that you had to

619
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:32,000
pull those words and parse those words and pull those words apart to see all the depth that each

620
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,680
individual word had and then the way that they're put together and what was great about this was

621
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:42,000
by the time I was back because then I went right back into the SEAL teams and somebody would hand

622
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,640
me a rules of engagement document and that was written by some lawyer in Washington DC and I'd

623
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,680
pull it out and say wait a second this word I don't know what this word means let's pull this

624
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:53,360
word out let's see what this let's see what this actual definition of this particular word is and

625
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:57,360
how that changes my viewpoint of these rules of engagement and how can I translate that for my

626
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:05,120
troops so that they actually know what to do so that part for me was from a reading perspective

627
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:10,160
starting to read Shakespeare and and saying oh okay you're not gonna understand this and if you

628
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:16,320
don't understand something that's okay you pull out the Oxford English dictionary and you look it up

629
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:20,880
and then you not just find out what the meaning of the word is but what's the root word and where

630
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,800
does it come from and what kind of depth and what kind of yeah that's really that's that's

631
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:30,320
unbelievably useful too to discover the connotation of words and the Oxford English dictionary is

632
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:36,560
particularly good for that because you you discover things that you'd never guess by looking at how

633
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:42,160
the word developed I mentioned the word hamartia like the fact that the word for sin was derived

634
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:49,440
from an archery concept was revelatory to me it's like that's so cool it ties this moral concept

635
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:56,880
abstract philosophy back down to something as as primordial as weaponry and hunting and just the

636
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,680
fact that that's the metaphor is absolutely fascinating and and then there's the overlap

637
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:06,480
in meaning that I already referred to and virtually every word is like that because word is an

638
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:11,920
ancient artifact it's like it's like an it's like an animal in some sense it has an evolutionary

639
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:17,520
history and it transforms across time and each word kind of it carries the echoes of its past

640
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:24,720
with it too because each word um attracts other words in a particular unique way so it kind of

641
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:30,960
lives in a word ecosystem as well and the ecosystem contain information about the history of that word

642
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:37,120
and you think well why is that important it's like well hey guess what you think in words you

643
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:44,800
talk in words you have all these archaic uh what are what these archaic entities these words these

644
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:49,360
living entities that you use it's like the more you know about them the more you know about you

645
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:54,080
the more you know about other people and the better you are at formulating and communicating

646
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:59,760
your ideas there's nothing there's nothing lost in that kind of investigation nothing there's

647
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:05,600
nothing but gain there so yeah and that's that was so that was the uh that was the English

648
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:11,600
road for me and and it was good thing I asked you that question hey yeah I'm really really

649
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:18,480
insightful for you to come up with that thank you thank you all right so so and you did you

650
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:25,520
did you enjoy university did you find a community there no okay so when I was going to university

651
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:31,360
I was married I I had two kids when I got to university I had three kids when I left I was

652
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:39,680
not a university student I was in fact in fact I would sit in the front row during my classes I

653
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:46,240
would have three pencils and three pens lined up and staged on my desk I would be ready to take

654
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:50,000
notes when the when if the teacher said something I didn't understand I'd be sitting in the front

655
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
row raised my hand I don't understand what you just said can you explain that and I mean you

656
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:59,440
know I'm 28 years old and there's a bunch of 18 years old in there and they just want to you know

657
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:06,080
go out and hang out with their friends and I'm there I'm in there to I'd love to really sound

658
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:09,760
come off sounding good and tell you that I was there to learn but I was there to get A's which

659
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:16,320
meant I did have to learn so I went at it as a competition and I was competing not with the other

660
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:20,640
students I was competing with the teachers because I'm a little bit crazy sometimes I would want to

661
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:24,800
make sure that they couldn't ask me a question on their test that I didn't know the answer to

662
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:32,000
so that's what I did and so did I have fun maybe not and one thing I when I got back to the seal

663
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:38,800
teams what I told the guys I'd say you know what I learned in college and they'd say what and I said

664
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:45,520
I learned never ever ever ever get out of the teams ever never get out of sorry get out of never

665
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:51,120
get out of the teams the seal teams never get out of the team okay okay well you know I taught

666
01:07:52,320 --> 01:08:00,400
older students in Boston and undergraduates and the the undergraduates especially in Boston but

667
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:06,320
also at the University of Toronto were very very bright and generally very hard working the older

668
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:14,560
students were generally not as highly selected but man they were committed and most of them had had

669
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:21,120
jobs that they weren't thrilled with let's say and had a hunger for what education could bring

670
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:26,160
them that the younger people lacked and so it does seem to me often and maybe this is just because

671
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:32,640
I'm getting older that after high school it might be good for people who want to pursue university

672
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:39,120
to go do something that they're qualified for which isn't much at that point for a year or two

673
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:44,400
so that when they do go to college or university they understand just exactly what they're being

674
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:53,280
offered yeah but I couldn't agree more working in the regular world will definitely make you

675
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:59,040
appreciate the opportunities that you may have if you go and learn more in the world

676
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:07,760
all right so you you came out of university you had three kids you were married what happens next

677
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:16,320
go back to the SEAL teams and go through the rest of my career I showed up at a SEAL team

678
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:21,600
September 11th had happened so I show up at a SEAL team I become a platoon commander at a SEAL

679
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:28,000
team and then go on deployment I get done with that deployment that deployment was primarily to

680
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,640
Baghdad although we worked kind of all over Iraq got done with that deployment I went and became

681
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:38,960
the aid to camp for the admiral that was in charge of all the SEALs at that point in time

682
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:45,280
and so that was sort of an well not even sort of it was a very administrative job but it was also

683
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:53,440
a huge opportunity for me to get to see the SEAL community in the most broad way that I could

684
01:09:54,080 --> 01:10:00,720
so I got to learn a lot there and then I went back to a SEAL team and was now what's called the

685
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:07,360
task unit commander which is two SEAL platoons combined together and I was in charge of two

686
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:11,440
SEAL platoons combined together which is called the task unit my task unit was called task unit

687
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:19,360
bruiser and we deployed to Ramadi Iraq and that was in the summer of 2006 very tough fighting

688
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:25,840
very tough battle and came home from that deployment hey so could I let me let me ask you

689
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:33,040
there so can you tell me can you describe a typical day or a typical week like what was it

690
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:38,480
like to be there I'd like all the details what you get tell me what happens when you get up in

691
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:46,640
the morning what did your day look like so we're there we showed up there and as soon as we got

692
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:53,760
there and we knew going into it in 2005 2006 if you can remember watching the news in 2005 2006

693
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:58,560
just about every day you would see in the news that there was

694
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:06,960
three soldiers killed in al-Ambar province or five marines killed in al-Ambar province or three

695
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:12,480
marines wounded in al-Ambar province and the capital of al-Ambar province is the city of Ramadi

696
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:18,320
and the vast majority of those casualties were happening inside the city of Ramadi and we knew

697
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:23,920
that going there and when you say we you say we were deployed there who are you you're obviously

698
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:29,280
referring to the country to your country but who what does we mean when you make when you say that

699
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:34,640
but when I say we in this particular case I'm talking about my seal task unit so I had and

700
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:42,240
that's how many how many people yeah so I had about 35 to 40 seals most of the time and then

701
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:52,480
another 60 around 60 support personnel and these people are armorers that you know can fix our

702
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:57,680
weapons and and mechanics that can fix our humvees and intelligence people that gather information

703
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:03,120
for us and radio operators that can receive our radio calls so there's a big support network that

704
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:09,920
goes with the the seal task unit as we deployed and why was it a seal enterprise what what was

705
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:15,920
specific about this deployment that that required this the whatever it is that the seals bring and

706
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:21,600
what is it exactly that the seals bring that's specific so on this particular deployment at this

707
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:28,000
at this point in time seals were deploying to iraq all the time we were there was always seals

708
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:34,240
in iraq my first deployment was in 2003 2004 and we were in the beginning of that deployment we were

709
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:40,480
the only seal platoon there and then by this time there would be many more seals I forget what the

710
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:47,200
number is but so we were in iraq and we were conducting special operations missions and

711
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:56,640
in particular in romadi when we got there so us standard seal operation on my first deployment

712
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:05,680
was get gather intelligence from various sources so so through various sources we would gather

713
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:12,640
intelligence about the location of a bad guy okay so you had you had a variety of people who were

714
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:20,080
targets identified and they were leaders of of what made what marked them out as bad

715
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:25,040
what were their characteristics these are these are people well we want to talk about

716
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:29,040
their psychological character no no no I mean you might be able to do a better job than that

717
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:34,160
I can tell you what they were doing for a living was trying to kill americans trying to kill coalition

718
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:39,120
forces trying to kill other iraqis trying to create chaos and mayhem for the interim government in

719
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:44,560
iraq these are and were they generally leaders of leaders of a group that you would target or

720
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:50,480
the are these people who were involved in the army on the other side or like put them in context

721
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:55,680
yeah so there's no there's no I mean the iraqi army is actually on our side right so these the

722
01:13:55,680 --> 01:14:01,760
iraqi army is our friends and that's who we're working alongside and now early in the war not

723
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:10,320
so much because the the coalition forces made a decision to disband the entire iraqi military

724
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:15,200
right right well this is why I wondered if there were people with on the military to what degree

725
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:20,800
there were people with military chanting that were facing you yes so since that happened a lot

726
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:26,000
and as a matter of fact in in the city of ramadi there were there used to be a massive

727
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:31,360
military iraqi military base there and so a bunch of former iraqi military lived there

728
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:35,440
there was a whole area that was called the it was there was an area called the

729
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:40,240
officer housing there was an area in ramadi that was called the officer housing where iraqi

730
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:46,560
officers used to live so and I'm not nailing that name but it's something like that um so yes there

731
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:54,000
was there was former iraqi regime army people that were out there fighting there was also foreign

732
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,160
fighters and so would they have their own little groups their bands of people that were fighting

733
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:03,600
with them you were and you were targeting leaders I'm just wondering how people were selected so

734
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:10,160
the the seals were after specific individuals generally speaking yes and here's what we figured

735
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:17,200
out if you only target the leaders well it's going to be a lot harder to catch them because

736
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:24,480
they're laying low and they're moving around and and they try and they try and give misinformation

737
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:29,040
about where they are and whatnot so what we'd go and go out and grab you know one of their

738
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:32,960
lieutenants grab one of their soldiers and find out where the lieutenant is grab the lieutenant

739
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:38,880
find out where the leader is so we there would be these cell networks these little these little

740
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:43,760
networks and maybe they're a mortar cell and they're they're dropping mortars they're a roadside bomb

741
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:48,080
cell and that's what they're doing and so we would figure out who these bad guys were and then

742
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:55,120
through these various intelligence sources we would find out a location maybe it was a mid-level

743
01:15:55,120 --> 01:16:00,000
guy maybe it was a high level guy maybe it was a low level guy and then once we know their location

744
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:07,120
we're going to get them so what what were the typical motivations of the people that you were

745
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:13,520
pursuing what what were they fighting for so there's a variety of motivation yeah some of the

746
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:18,480
you know if you're a front line guess what if you're a 15 year old kid with no money

747
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:26,880
guess what's a good motivator money and you and these the insurgents to be yep the insurgents

748
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:33,360
say hey we'll give you 100 bucks to go launch an rpg at the american base so that's their motivation

749
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:39,120
end of story the higher you get up the chain of command the the more you're going to start

750
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:45,360
leaning towards legitimate jihadists that now there's jihadists throughout the chain of command

751
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:50,560
don't get me wrong and and i mean hardcore jihadists and and i remember the first time i

752
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:58,240
was in my first deployment the first time i saw a legit hardcore jihadist you can tell

753
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:05,360
that these this guy hated us and it was very clear from the look on his face when we captured him

754
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:11,920
it was completely he was filled with seething hatred so there's jihadists throughout the

755
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:16,240
chain of command and that guy was like i'm so so so the the jihadist motivation was

756
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:21,760
well by definition in some sense a religious motivation but your experience of it was that

757
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:27,280
it was primarily a visceral hate and hatred for what do you think i mean obviously you're an

758
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:35,200
occupying force let's say and you know and and america is seen at at least among the jihadists

759
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:43,280
of that time as as a truly satanic force i suppose i mean what's motivating what was your experience

760
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:48,320
of what was motivating the hatred yes it's everything you just said but i mean you can

761
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:54,320
trace it all the way back to the israeli palestinian conflict i mean you can they're they're gonna

762
01:17:54,320 --> 01:18:03,200
draw and see view view the west as evil as the great satan and and so that's what what did you

763
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:09,760
think at that point about the morality of the endeavor i mean because this is why i'm curious

764
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:14,800
like and please do correct me i'm sure i'm wrong about many of the things that i think but

765
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:22,640
it seems to me that the clearer your moral sense when you're engaged in a battle the more likely

766
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:28,000
you are all things considered to win because you're not part of you isn't going to be fighting

767
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:33,520
against you right and i mean in any enterprises like that if i you know i find that if i'm involved

768
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:41,120
in a prod project and i have reservations then the part of me that has reservations 20 percent of me

769
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:46,560
pushes against the other 80 percent and then i'm only 60 percent as effective as i might be

770
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:52,400
and so whenever i engage in an enterprise i try to walk through it ethically and see well am i

771
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:58,560
actually committed to this what qualms do i have what what doubts do i have what resistances do i have

772
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:04,160
because that's going to make me weak and so when you go into battle i presume it's the same thing

773
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:09,760
that you have to believe i know they say that soldiers also fight very hard for the guy who's

774
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:15,360
in the foxhole next to them so there's that brotherhood camaraderie but you go there as

775
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:20,640
a representative of your country as well your nation and and there is that there has to be

776
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:24,880
that ethical dimension to it and so what how did you guys deal with that

777
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:34,640
looking at what we're doing and and what's what's really interesting is even though when you stare

778
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:42,800
at it from a strategic perspective when you say oh as a western power as this country we're going

779
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:49,680
in here and we could argue all day long about whether that's a right call or a wrong call

780
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:54,320
whether that's morally correct or whether it's an immoral move we could have arguments about

781
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:59,680
that all day yes well they've been going on for 3000 years in the middle east right right endless

782
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:09,840
arguments about what's right and and here's what here's what one of the nice benefits of being on

783
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:18,240
the ground is you get to see what's happening what's actually happening so what you see in

784
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:24,080
iraq when you're actually on the ground is for instance in ramadi what you see and what we saw

785
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:33,760
is the iraqi populace who are a bunch of normal people that want to carry out their lives and

786
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:40,000
raise their kids and run whatever business they're going to run that's what they want to do they want

787
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:46,720
to they want they actually want life liberty and the pursuit of happiness is what they want

788
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:51,120
that's a normal iraqi family when we would when we would go to an iraqi family's house that's

789
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:59,600
pretty much what you're dealing with and amongst those normal people that just want to live their

790
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:08,960
lives in peace there are insurgents and the insurgents want power they want control and

791
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:21,040
they are willing to do anything to get it and so when you see fathers beheaded and their heads

792
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:31,520
left in the yard of a family because he had you know had really he was he was working with a shake

793
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:38,240
that had said things against al-qaeda and now this guy is beheaded uh we there was a guy that

794
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:46,720
was skinned alive there was torture there was rape so when you are on the ground and you see

795
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:54,960
this stuff happening and you see the local populace clapping and cheering when you kill insurgents

796
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:05,680
your strategic vision isn't quite in focus as much as what you're seeing right in front of you

797
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:14,160
with your own two eyes and so therefore the 20 of you that might be arguing whether this is right

798
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:24,800
or wrong when you see families slaughtered you you very quickly tell that 20 of your brain

799
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:30,960
that you don't you need to look at what's happening right here this is this this is this is immoral

800
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:38,480
and we need to do what we can to help these people and do you did you feel then and and then again

801
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:48,000
now i mean it's a quagmire it's an ethical quagmire the middle east and so it seems in some sense

802
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:55,600
that no matter what you do there it's wrong and and i'm not trying to convince you of that believe

803
01:22:55,680 --> 01:23:01,440
me i'm i'm really curious about this you felt when you were there that you were on the side

804
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:10,880
that was doing the right things do you um and now when you look back i mean i don't know what to make

805
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:15,680
of what what happened with the us in the middle east over the last 15 years i'm just as happy and

806
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:22,080
perhaps you are as well there's less engagement in foreign wars now than there was 10 years ago in

807
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:27,920
the us right that seems to have receded to some degree and that perhaps that's a good thing

808
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:36,000
what do you think about the about about america's involvement in iraq what what conclusions have

809
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:43,040
you come to so you talked about this argument that you're going to have in your own head

810
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:51,280
well you are also going to have that argument on a national level right you're going to have

811
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:57,600
a national level argument of whether this is the right thing or the wrong thing to do so my

812
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:09,040
scale my measure of this is if you are going to go to war if you are going to go to war

813
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:21,680
you have to make sure before you go that you have the proper will the proper will and there's

814
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:27,840
two types of will that you need to have if you're going to go to war the first type of will that you

815
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:32,480
need to have if you're going to go to war is you have to have the will to kill

816
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:40,720
you have to have the will to kill and guess what i am sorry to inform everybody it is not just the

817
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:51,200
will to kill the enemy because when you go to war war is an imperfect is an imperfect endeavor

818
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:58,880
and no matter how hard you try to just kill the the enemy you will kill civilians you will kill

819
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:06,800
women you will kill children that is what is going to happen that is what is going to happen

820
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:14,880
if you go to war so you have to make sure you have the will to do that that sometimes you're

821
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:20,320
going to drop a bomb and it's going to land and it's going to kill women and children that's what's

822
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:26,240
going to happen and anybody that thinks anything different is naive and ignorant

823
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:32,080
and we seem to let our politicians often convince us that that's possible but it's not

824
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:41,040
so you have to have the will to kill and then on top of that obviously you have to have the will

825
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:49,360
to die you have to have you have to know and understand that if you embark in a war

826
01:25:49,600 --> 01:26:00,400
your sons and daughters are going to be killed that is what is going to happen and anybody that says

827
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:08,800
it's not going to happen is naive and ignorant now i think before we go to war oftentimes we

828
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:15,040
rationalize that we can mitigate the risk of killing we can mitigate the risk of dying

829
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:20,160
and for some reason we think we can mitigate those risks down to zero which is impossible

830
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:30,880
so if you have the will if you look at a situation and say we need to do something here

831
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:38,960
for moral reasons for national security reasons we need to take action okay so let me ask you a

832
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:46,800
question there if you don't mind um you know whenever i have had to take difficult action in

833
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:57,600
the past so take to take a risk my justification for that so what allowed me to organize my will

834
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:06,000
let's say was a belief that inaction was a worse crime so

835
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:17,120
i'm trying to think through what it takes to conjure up the will that you just described

836
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:23,280
morally speaking and it's very difficult to talk about the morality of war but it's absolutely

837
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:30,640
necessary clearly do you believe that in the situation in iraq do you think that

838
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:36,480
the argument was laid forth it's it's it's such a it's it's

839
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:46,160
so there was a terrible attack on new york 9 11 and the response was

840
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:56,560
focused on iraq that's correct so far yes i'm afghanistan immediately and yes

841
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:02,960
thereafter focused on iraq yes all right it was never obvious to me why the focus shifted to iraq

842
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:11,040
do you do you have any sense of why that was i know that there was a lot of thought at the highest

843
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:17,840
levels of the american government prior to 9 11 about iraq and so there was a plan that was already

844
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:25,760
in some sense in place for iraq but it isn't obvious to me why attention was shifted towards iraq

845
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:34,640
in the aftermath apart from the fact that that plan already existed i think the shift came

846
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:42,880
from i'm trying to think of some kind of a metaphor here but you know you've got you've

847
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:51,600
got some rats in you know in the garage and the rats have nod through some of the wiring

848
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:58,560
and so you go and you you know you try and kill the rats in the garage and you realize you know

849
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:03,920
what this isn't the only place that these rats seem could could be there could also be some

850
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:11,040
rats over here in the basement and we have wires over there too we better go handle that situation

851
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:17,120
as well you said that you were overwhelmed by the reality of the situation on the ground

852
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:22,400
my first deployment to iraq we we worked with we we just worked with seals basically all the

853
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:28,080
operations we did was just with seals when we went back to iraq and ramadi we were ordered

854
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:34,480
to work with iraqi soldiers now the iraqi soldiers were poorly trained they were poorly

855
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:39,920
equipped they had low motivation some of them were not very trustworthy and we were going out

856
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:47,520
into the worst battlefield on planet earth at the time and it was it was pretty hard to make sense

857
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:54,960
of that order right mm-hmm but when i thought through the order you know why why is why is

858
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:59,360
why is my senior leadership ordering me to do this well the answer is quite clear

859
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:04,480
after i thought about it a little bit hey the reason that we have to do this is because

860
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:10,320
we need to work with the iraqi soldiers so that the iraqi soldiers become proficient enough

861
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:16,400
that they can handle the security in their own country of course yes okay so my my my

862
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:21,680
my senior leadership isn't telling me to do something because they want me to die

863
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:25,520
or want my troops to get wounded and killed they're telling me to do something because

864
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:32,000
it's a strategic move where in hopefully two or three years the iraqi military will be

865
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:38,080
at a level where they can handle security in their own country okay got it okay that's part one

866
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:46,400
well when when we got ordered to work with iraqi soldiers it wasn't just it wasn't just

867
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:52,320
my seal tasking it was everyone all coalition forces all american army and marine corps

868
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:57,040
was getting told you'll work with iraqi forces and everyone kind of had that nervous feeling

869
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:01,680
right hold on a second you want me to have this person that has a rusty ak-47 and a pair

870
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:05,520
of sandals you want that person to to support me out on the battlefield that doesn't make

871
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:11,280
any sense and so what the american forces did was when they were ordered to take iraqi soldiers

872
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:18,560
with them on an operation and they would go out with a platoon of 40 americans and they would take

873
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:25,520
two iraqis with them because they were told to take iraqis plural so that means two that's what

874
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:29,760
we're gonna do and they leave them in the hun v and they go conduct their operations well senior

875
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:35,680
leadership got wind of this and this obviously is not in the spirit of what we're being told to do

876
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:41,440
you're not going to get a nation's army trained up by taking two soldiers out so the next thing

877
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:51,360
the leadership said was okay here's the new order for every one american that you bring out

878
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:58,400
you have to have seven iraqi soldiers with you so yeah that's different so they imposed a ratio on

879
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:05,360
us now ramadi at this time was a complete war zone other parts of iraq were actually somewhat

880
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:12,560
pacified and in many of those pacified areas that order actually made sense the the the iraqis in

881
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:18,320
some area the iraqi soldiers in some areas were actually capable of conducting decent operations

882
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:25,120
with very little american oversight and the level of violence in those areas wasn't that bad so it

883
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:33,280
was okay well in ramadi it didn't make any sense whatsoever so i'm being ordered to take one seal

884
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:37,760
for every seven iraqi soldiers well first of all because of the fighting was so bad in ramadi

885
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:48,160
many of the iraqi units only had 10 or 15 or 20 people in their platoon so if i was going to send

886
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:55,360
out seals i would only be able to send out two seals 15 iraqi soldiers so now which two seals

887
01:32:55,360 --> 01:33:01,120
am i going to send am i going to send the medic well i want to send a medic for sure but guess

888
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:04,800
what i also need to send a machine gunner in case we get into a firefight well what about the

889
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:09,120
radio man that actually calls for help what about the point man that actually knows where we're going

890
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:13,680
what about the leader who's going to make decisions out there what about the explosive ordinance

891
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:19,840
disposal guy that can dismantle bombs from going off so who am i supposed to leave behind

892
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:27,760
it doesn't make any sense the the danger to the troops is so much higher in that situation

893
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:33,840
so what did i do did i say that's what i'm being ordered to do no i took all this into

894
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:40,320
consideration and i and i you'll appreciate this i wrote a point paper up my chain of command

895
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:44,560
explain the situation of what was happening explain the number of casualties explain the

896
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:48,960
level of violence explain the size of the iraqi elements that we were working with and said can

897
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:54,160
i please get a waiver for this and allow me to take however many seals i've deemed necessary to

898
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:58,320
take to be safe and my chain of command read it and said yeah sure jockel do whatever you want to do

899
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:04,640
thank you so that's okay so what what you what you're what you're telling me is that you take

900
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:10,560
what you're told to do and you take what you know to be the case on the ground and you try to do

901
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:15,600
do try to take both of them into account as much as possible while you're also shunting information

902
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:20,560
back up the hierarchy hopefully to modify their decisions the decisions they're making that aren't

903
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:25,040
in accordance with the reality on the ground right right so you do i mean you do your best

904
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:29,920
under the circumstance but that that makes that that that seems to be that's that seems to be a

905
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:36,640
good answer but but it escalates obviously it can escalate higher than that right it can

906
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:43,280
the decisions the orders that we're being given can escalate to a point where maybe this entire

907
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:49,200
thing that we're doing i think is wrong right right okay so now we get into a situation where

908
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:55,120
and the reason that i i have to explain all these other things is because it happens very rarely

909
01:34:55,840 --> 01:35:00,320
it happens very rarely that you know someone in the military is looking at a decision that's

910
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:05,520
being made up on a big scale and says i think this is totally and completely wrong now i will tell you

911
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:08,880
and i wrote about this in my last leadership book leadership strategy and tactics

912
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:14,640
if you're being told to do something that you

913
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:21,280
believe is completely wrong well i would love to tell you that that's a black and white decision

914
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:26,320
but guess what it's not even that's not a black and white decision because jordan if you order me

915
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:32,240
to go and assault a machine gun nest that's that's on a hill with my squad

916
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:38,000
and i know that this is a machine gun nest in a bunkered position in an elevated position

917
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,000
with interlocking fields of fire and if we go up that hill we're all gonna die

918
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:46,960
and i look at you and say hey hey boss i don't think that's a good call they're

919
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:51,280
elevated they're bunkered they're interlocking this doesn't make any sense and you go no jocco

920
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:55,040
shut up and do it i said no i'm telling you jordan this isn't a good idea and you say no

921
01:35:55,040 --> 01:36:02,560
shut up and do it now here's my decision point if i say you know what i will not do it i will not do

922
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:08,160
it you know what you do you go cool jocco you're fired and you get your yes man come over and your

923
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:11,520
yes man comes in you say go assault that machine gun nest and he takes the squad up and he gets

924
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:20,800
everybody killed so i surrendered my influence when i when i drew that line in the sand and said no

925
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:26,000
and you doomed other people to death and i doomed other people to death now my boss orders me you

926
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:30,960
order me and i say okay boss got it you you you definitely want me to do this there's no way out

927
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:35,200
yes you definitely got to do it okay all right guys here's what's happening we're gonna start

928
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:38,080
we're gonna get into a covered position we're gonna start maneuvering towards this thing

929
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:43,520
we're gonna see what kind of fire we receive if we start receiving overwhelming fire

930
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:49,600
i'm gonna lock some of you guys in that position and i'm gonna send another squad over to the flank

931
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:52,960
and we're gonna we're gonna take out this machine gun from nest from another angle or

932
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:57,840
i'm gonna hunker down in that position and we're gonna call for air support so i go you're decomposing

933
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:01,920
you're actually decomposing the process then into micro elements and then testing the micro

934
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:07,600
elements then you can report back with that information yes right right very smart very

935
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:13,760
we have to be very careful so when you talk about oh i don't think we should go into iraq

936
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:18,000
i don't think we should go okay so what am i gonna do hey i don't think we should go now

937
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,960
are there times where that might be the right decision there are some times like that where

938
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:30,880
maybe i think that me as a senior leader standing up and saying no to my boss is gonna make you

939
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:34,400
know jordan suddenly looks at me goes wait a second jocco's always been a good guy and now

940
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:38,400
we're sitting here telling me no he's really serious about maybe i maybe i'm not seeing something

941
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:45,200
maybe i can get you to rethink your position that's a risky move though it's always a risky

942
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:50,800
move to kind of draw a line in the sand yeah kind of an ultimatum because if you use up your capital

943
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:54,960
you burn your leadership capital it's even worse than that you just completely surrender your

944
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:59,440
leadership guy you don't even use it you you you obliterated it's gone you have no more influence

945
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:08,160
you're done so we have to think very long and hard about those things and so when it if i was

946
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:13,680
i was never put in a position like where i didn't where where i thought that what we were doing as

947
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:20,000
a country was wrong i'll tell you actually probably the closest i've come to that was i think it was

948
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:30,960
1993 the the massacre was unfolding in rwanda there was the the um the uh who twos were killing

949
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:39,760
the tutsis by the hundreds of thousands and i was on a navy ship um off the coast of off the

950
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:48,800
coast of africa on standby to go into rwanda as this slaughter took place took place and

951
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:58,400
we didn't do anything we didn't do anything so that's the cost of not going to war there

952
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:02,000
it's the cost of not going to war and and there's a very you know it's a very interesting i'm sure

953
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:08,480
you've heard of the the the massacre that took took place in me line vietnam and and one of the most

954
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:14,880
interesting things in that reprehensible scenario is

955
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:24,240
what stopped it what's so this is this this this horror is unfolding there's there's murder

956
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:34,560
mutilation rape just going berserk a company of american soldiers is murdering raping mutilating

957
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:43,360
bodies just absolutely heinous absolutely reprehensible and while this is happening a

958
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:50,560
helicopter pilot comes in and sees what's going on and these guys have lost their mind really

959
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:54,880
the guys on the ground have lost their mind the helicopter pilot flies back to base he walks into

960
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:59,200
the tactical operation center and says hey they are killing civilians out there the commanding

961
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:03,520
officer gets on the phone and says hey stop killing people and they stopped immediately

962
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:09,600
they stopped immediately that's that's what tells you how important leadership is

963
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:14,320
leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield and if you have a leader that's going

964
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:18,560
to let things start to go in this direction all it takes is one person to step up and say hey everyone

965
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:26,480
stop what you're doing this is wrong so you get a situation like rwanda we didn't really do anything

966
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:34,880
we we didn't do anything and what would it have taken if if we rolled in there and said hey no

967
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:41,920
more stop do they look around with their machetes covered in blood and wake up of their neighbors

968
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:50,720
and say oh wait a second yep okay we're gonna stop so i'm not saying these are easy predicaments

969
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:58,320
but certainly you know the idea of are there situations where it's better to do something

970
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:02,640
than nothing i'll tell you what rolling into Baghdad and going into Saddam Hussein's torture

971
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:13,280
chambers which we did and you see the the the uh the the hook there was hooks like hooks hanging

972
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:21,040
from ceilings and and drainage where blood would drain in these torture chambers you see that a

973
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:29,360
couple times and you think i'm okay with us being in here and getting rid of this guy

974
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:39,600
i'm gonna switch topics i want to talk to you about your books and i'd like to know look you

975
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:44,480
said right at the beginning of this interview that you wanted to be the best navy seal good navy

976
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:48,560
seal that's what you said you didn't say the best you want to be a good navy the best was aiming a

977
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:54,320
little bit too high yeah i know that's why i wanted i wanted to get the words right um what are you

978
01:41:54,320 --> 01:42:03,520
doing now but you i mean i i presume that that your life is still being lived in an expansion

979
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:09,840
of that the pursuit of that initial ideal you've transformed multiple times you're a civilian you

980
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:14,960
you're you're a communicator mass communicator in a variety of different in a variety of different

981
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:19,040
ways i think you mentioned we were talking offline a little bit for example that you have a clothing

982
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:24,640
line and i'm going to ask you about that because that's that's that's a curious thing to me um

983
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:32,400
and that is i'm definitely curious about that but like what's your mission and is that the right

984
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:42,800
question is that an appropriate question so there's a there's there's a there's a there's a quality

985
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:51,680
let's call it so as i as i went through that that as i created in my mind that ideal of of what a

986
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:57,440
good seal is what is a good seal and and i'm sure you could i could say okay what do you think

987
01:42:57,440 --> 01:43:01,760
jordan oh he's probably strong and he's probably fast and he's probably smart and he's probably

988
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:05,680
tactically sound and he can probably shoot a weapon straight and all those things absolutely all

989
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:15,280
those things are there and as you would kind of burn away the the or if you were to set up a hierarchy

990
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:22,160
of importance of what makes a good seal yeah you might think that some people would think oh well

991
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:27,040
it's probably being the best shot or it's probably being the strongest or it's probably being really

992
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:31,760
good in the water all those things all those skills that you think it might be and you could

993
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:36,160
talk to different seals and they would all kind of you know some guy would say it's running some

994
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:40,080
guys say it's strong some guy would say it's a best shot whatever best tactician

995
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:44,240
but if you offered them one thing

996
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:53,440
99.9 percent of seals would agree on what makes you a good seal

997
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:01,280
and that is you look out for your teammates

998
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:10,880
you put your team above yourself yeah so that's a real inversion of the things that you just

999
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:16,800
described a because all of those things are dimensions along which you could be excellent

1000
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:23,120
in a manner that distinguishes you from the group and elevates you above them but you derive from

1001
01:44:23,120 --> 01:44:31,440
that acclaim that that should all be subordinate to a reciprocity and any seal that's a good seal

1002
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:36,720
would tell you that that would be at the top of the hierarchy you can be the best shot yeah

1003
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:40,080
you can be the best shot you can be the best diver you can be the strongest you can be the

1004
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:44,880
fastest you can be the best tactician if you don't take care of your teammates

1005
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:50,480
none of that none of those other things matter you you're not even wanted in the seal teams

1006
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:57,360
that's that's that's what it is so well do you think that that seems to me to be true for

1007
01:44:58,240 --> 01:45:03,600
functional organizations in general is that and and certainly the people I've seen this is part of

1008
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:09,600
the reason why casual critiques of hierarchies annoy me so much because the people I've seen

1009
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:16,320
who are radically successful don't get there from power they get there from mobility but also

1010
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:27,840
reciprocity and yeah um 100 right so when you say to take care to look out for and to take

1011
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:33,040
care of I think you said to look out for what flesh that out what does that mean in the situations

1012
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:40,560
that you've been in and how did that guide your behavior it's a it's a it's it's a literal constant

1013
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:50,320
daily hourly by the minute attitude which is okay hey my my buddy needs me to to to move over there

1014
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:54,400
and cover for that area that's what i'm going to do my buddy needs to me to bring him some more

1015
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:58,960
ammunition my buddy needs to me to help him clean this weapon my buddy needs to you carry the boat

1016
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:03,600
I need to pick up the boat because we're moving across the beach all these things so what are you

1017
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:08,320
doing you're you're looking so what like you said moment to moment so what are you doing you're

1018
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:17,120
looking for ways to be useful constantly how can I support my teammates what can I give to them how

1019
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:24,000
can I make them how can I make their situation better right now and and that that guy that has

1020
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:29,040
that attitude has going to have a great reputation in the sea yeah well then you can think too of

1021
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:34,880
course then the fact that you're outstanding on any number of dimensions let's say that becomes an

1022
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:39,920
asset of the team rather than something that's a competitive liability because like if you're

1023
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:44,160
going to be looking out for me and I really believe that the fact that you're stronger and

1024
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:49,360
smarter than me is actually really good because now I've got someone who's stronger than me and

1025
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:53,520
smarter than me who's looking out for me and so whatever competitive jealousy there might have

1026
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:58,640
been there could be easily subsumed under appreciation for those positive attributes

1027
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:03,280
yes and we are going to work together because guess what you might be the strongest but I'm a

1028
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:07,440
little bit faster than you right right right and you might be a good shot but I'm better in the water

1029
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:13,360
than you are and we're going to be in the water and shooting so we're each going to have a chance to be

1030
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:22,640
number one yes so the reason I went to that and how long did it take you to figure that out like

1031
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:29,440
you said something interesting about assembling the image of an ideal seal in in your imagination

1032
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:34,400
and so was that something that were you consciously aware of doing that while you were

1033
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:39,360
doing that or did you see that you were doing that in retrospect unconscious and saw that I

1034
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:45,200
did it in retrospect and the team that the support your teammate is something that you

1035
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:52,000
hear immediately and if you listen to it it's you can't miss it now guys miss it guys definitely

1036
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:58,640
miss it but if your eyes are open and your ears are open you can't miss it it's day one seal basic

1037
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:03,600
indoctrination you take care of your swim buddy they literally say that day one they'll say take

1038
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:08,240
care of your swim buddy and what does that mean in the in the swim buddy context what how would that

1039
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:14,880
what does that translate to practically that means before Jordan gets inspected by the instructor

1040
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:19,680
I take a look at Jordan's gear and make sure it's all squared away and say you're good to go

1041
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:26,240
as opposed to seeing that your life jackets got a twisted strap and just sitting there looking

1042
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:31,280
straight ahead no I want to make sure you're okay that's actually before I check myself I'm checking you

1043
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:36,400
before I check myself I'm checking you I'm making sure that you're good to go

1044
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:41,360
Jesus is partly why these claims the broad claims that are being made in the social

1045
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:48,800
world at large now about hierarchical power being the the fundamental attribute of society

1046
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:57,120
it's so disturbing to me because this this this is not true it's literally not true only when a

1047
01:48:57,120 --> 01:49:03,200
hierarchy becomes radically dysfunctional does individual power come to dominate the rest of

1048
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:09,040
the time it's something like what you're saying is that and that's that's that's and and that's true

1049
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:14,480
let's you know capitalism has a bad rap let's say morally because of its selfishness but the

1050
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:20,000
functional organizations that I've seen that are business organizations if if the people in there

1051
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:25,920
aren't motivated by the ethos that you're just that you're describing no no one bloody well

1052
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:30,960
wants to work with them no one wants to buy their material no one wants to partner with them across

1053
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:37,600
time they don't even want to go golfing with them so it's just not it's it's so not true it's

1054
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:42,320
completely not true and that's I mean that's the essence of the books that I've written about

1055
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:49,680
leadership is that story over and over again I had a I had a seal platoon commander that operated

1056
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:57,120
via power his his authority and his power that's how we operated we did what he told us

1057
01:49:57,120 --> 01:50:00,560
because he told us to do it because he was the highest ranking guy and you better be quiet and

1058
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:04,480
listen to me and it's going to be my plan and you all better just shut up and get on board with it

1059
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:12,640
and we had a we had a mutiny we had a mutiny in that seal platoon where we we went to his boss

1060
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:18,080
and said we're not working with this guy and he actually ended up getting fired

1061
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:24,960
so everything you just said well you well and that's exactly right look there's there's

1062
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:34,080
no stable organization no organization can run stably across time if its predicate of operation

1063
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:39,920
is raw power and the reason for that at some point is that the people who are being tyrannized

1064
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:46,880
are going to band together and say no we're not going to do this we're going to take you out

1065
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:52,880
and so if you don't want to be taken out you can't exercise tyrannical power it's it's the intrinsic

1066
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:59,440
weakness of tyranny this and to to confuse functional incompetent organizations with tyranny

1067
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:06,400
is also to make a mockery of the fact that this cooperative ethos is actually the dominating

1068
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:15,280
principle if the if the if the organization is functioning properly yeah and as i pointed out i

1069
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:20,720
actually lived through that and i lived through the other end of the spectrum too when that platoon

1070
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:27,920
commander got fired the platoon that commander that took his place was very humble listened

1071
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:33,440
had an open mind gave us ownership told us to come up with a plan and we love that guy and

1072
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:38,240
that's the guy that i try and emulate to this day and we would have followed that guy anywhere

1073
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:44,800
and it it's it's precisely right and so that's not power that's not power it's precisely because he

1074
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:52,320
didn't use his tyrannical power to to drive us to do what he what he wanted us to do

1075
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:56,800
look whenever i've been in a situation and wanted to get the best out of the people that

1076
01:51:56,800 --> 01:52:05,520
are working under me or with me for that matter i see as much responsibility and authority to them

1077
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:12,800
as possible partly because one of my predicates of operation is that if i'm going to engage in an

1078
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:20,640
enterprise with you and i have to tell you what to do and or if i told you what to do you would

1079
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:26,160
do a better job i should find a different person all that is is indication that i chose the wrong

1080
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:30,720
person if you're the right person i'm going to grant you as much autonomy as possible partly

1081
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:35,120
because then you get to have your own domain partly then because you're self-sufficient

1082
01:52:35,120 --> 01:52:39,840
partly because you do better but even more so because then you're fully committed to the task

1083
01:52:41,120 --> 01:52:45,680
and i i don't believe that anybody occupies a position of leadership for long who doesn't

1084
01:52:45,680 --> 01:52:51,040
know those things and they're certainly not effective if they don't know them no they're not

1085
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:59,360
and i i talk to leaders all day every day in every every possible industry that you can think of

1086
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:06,320
and it's one of the things that i end up saying a lot to leaders is you know when if you're working

1087
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:11,680
for me jordan and you come to me with a plan of how you want to execute a project or an operation

1088
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:18,320
or a task my goal my goal is that we're going to use your idea that's my goal my goal is that

1089
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:23,200
whatever you present to me if it's the if it's going to get the job done we're good we're going

1090
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:27,760
with it you know then at least the person can learn from what they're doing and be better the next

1091
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:33,680
time right if it's minimally viable why not let them run it sometimes an emergency and you can't

1092
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:40,000
do that but yeah yeah and by the way if there's urgency and i can't do that okay by this time

1093
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:44,800
you and i have built an up enough trust that you know that if i say hey we need to go over there

1094
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:50,160
right now you go yep got it right right so so we do get into situations like that happens right

1095
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:54,320
and that's that's something you don't want to do too often because just as we discussed earlier

1096
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:59,920
you burn up your leadership credibility by doing that so you can use power if you're a leader but

1097
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:05,040
but judiciously and seldom and you need a good rationale and people have to trust you and so

1098
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:09,840
that's the other issue is that we could we could think about the preconditions for trust because

1099
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:15,760
if the organization isn't running on trust then everybody's at each other's throat constantly

1100
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:21,920
and all there is is backbiting and confusion and so to trust means i i have to i have to

1101
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:29,200
i have to what would i say i have to have faith in your motives and i have to see that you're doing

1102
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:34,240
your best to align your motives with mind and i have to believe that that's genuine because

1103
01:54:34,240 --> 01:54:38,320
otherwise the enterprise isn't going to succeed given all the other things it's going to have to face

1104
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:46,080
yeah it's uh it's another you know you bring up the term alignment and when i work with companies

1105
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:52,880
sometimes sometimes we'll start talking about alignment and and quite frankly

1106
01:54:54,160 --> 01:55:01,680
in most cases vast majority of cases if you and i are at a company if we go high enough

1107
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:08,560
high enough up what i call the the ladder of alignment if we go high enough up that ladder

1108
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:14,320
we'll get to a point where we're going to be aligned because look right definitely we're trying to

1109
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:18,720
take care of our team we're trying to provide a good service to our clients and we're trying

1110
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:24,640
to be profitable and and if look if that's what we're trying to do and 99.9 of the times the

1111
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:30,000
companies that i work with i have to talk them through this but i can say we can get to a point

1112
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:37,440
where we are aligned now what yeah alignment has like a like a like a like a cousin or or maybe a

1113
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:44,320
step cousin called agenda where where you've got your agenda over here and i've got my agenda over

1114
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:47,680
here and you're trying to get more funds for your department i'm trying to get more funds for my

1115
01:55:47,680 --> 01:55:54,000
department and so we can kind of sometimes it can feel like our agendas we're not aligned yeah

1116
01:55:54,560 --> 01:56:00,160
now oftentimes i say look if if jordan's agenda is to get more funding for his department so he

1117
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:05,680
can invest more and make more money for the team his agenda is aligned and that's great that i have

1118
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:09,920
no problem with your agenda it's when you know you're trying to create your own fiefdom because

1119
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:13,120
you're going to leave the company and you're going to go do something else and i start to sense that

1120
01:56:13,120 --> 01:56:19,600
and and whenever yeah no that's going on underground and no one's really talking about it right right

1121
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:26,160
when i get a company where they can't come to a they can't come to an agreement about something

1122
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:30,160
they can't they cannot so we walk them up the the alignment ladder and all of a sudden you realize

1123
01:56:30,160 --> 01:56:36,000
oh wait a second this person's just trying to make money and this right right really wants to

1124
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:40,080
take care of the team now i'll tell you i'll take them further up the alignment ladder and say listen

1125
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:44,080
if you really want to make money and you want to take care of the team guess what if you have a

1126
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:48,320
good team that you take care of you're going to make more money yeah yeah yeah so you can get aligned

1127
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:53,920
unless people are starting to take care of themselves instead of take care of the team

1128
01:56:53,920 --> 01:56:58,320
which goes back to what we were just talking about which is also extremely short-sighted in my

1129
01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:02,880
estimation because for a bunch of reasons i i lined some of this out in in this new book

1130
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:10,560
this i realized a long time ago that there isn't much difference there might be no difference

1131
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:16,240
actually technically speaking in in taking care of yourself and in taking care of other people

1132
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:24,800
and here's the reason so you might say well i'm one person and everyone else is a group of people

1133
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:29,200
and so there's that competition between me as one person and what this one person wants

1134
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:35,520
and the group but that's not true because i'm actually a group and the reason i'm a group is

1135
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:42,640
well there's me today but there's me over the next week and there's me over the next month and then

1136
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:47,120
there's me over the next year and over the next five years and over the next 10 years and the me

1137
01:57:47,120 --> 01:57:52,640
that exists right now can't betray the me that's going to exist next week by doing something

1138
01:57:52,640 --> 01:57:58,000
short-sighted and impulsive that will you know produce a burst of impulsive pleasure but will

1139
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:05,120
compromise the future and so if i'm taking myself into account seriously which i'm an

1140
01:58:05,120 --> 01:58:11,680
entity that has multiple incarnations let's say across very large spans of time then i immediately

1141
01:58:11,680 --> 01:58:16,400
have a community that i have to serve i have to serve the 80 year old person that i'm going to become

1142
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:22,480
and the difference between that and serving 80 year old people in the community is negligible

1143
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:28,320
it's the same thing so if i'm taking care of someone in a in a senior's home for example

1144
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:34,080
there the difference between that and how i'm going to be taken care of when i'm 80 is negligible

1145
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:42,240
and so there's no there's there's there's no way out of the ethical demand of of serving the group

1146
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:47,760
even if you're even if your selfishness is is is of the most enlightened kind

1147
01:58:49,680 --> 01:58:53,200
well that's one of the most beautiful things about this about this

1148
01:58:54,800 --> 01:59:03,360
whole thing conceptually is that if i put the team before myself if i put the mission and the team

1149
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:09,760
before myself and by being a good team player i i i lift up jordan and i and i make you look good

1150
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:16,640
and i give you the support you need the beautiful thing about this is eventually i am going to win

1151
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:23,760
right i'm 100 going to win and people get short-sighted as you're talking about where i think

1152
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:29,360
you know what if i can if i can pull this project away from jordan i can raise my head up and get

1153
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:32,880
some credit for this the boss is going to look at me and he's probably going to give me a promotion

1154
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:40,000
and that that might work once that might work once yeah or twice yeah and then my reputation is oh

1155
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,960
you don't want jocco on your team because he's the one that's going to be maneuvering around

1156
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:48,720
trying to make himself look good instead of trying to accomplish the mission yeah so ultimately if

1157
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:54,880
if you take care of people if you're a good seal if you're a good team player you will win in the

1158
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:59,760
end that's what's going to happen and yes and you win you'll win surrounded by people who are

1159
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:05,840
thrilled to death that you won and so and that's that's that's a much better form of winning than to

1160
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:13,760
be bitter and alone yeah because you've snatched something on the back of the fallen right right

1161
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:18,560
absolutely and and the fact that it's own you know you can only get away with that once or twice is

1162
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:24,160
dead relevant because human beings are very sensitive to negative emotion we remember and one of the

1163
02:00:24,160 --> 02:00:30,800
things we really remember is betrayal and so if if you don't play the game straight and you have to

1164
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:35,200
play the game over and over with the same people then you're dead in the water and then you're

1165
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:39,600
going to be in your own little hell you're going to think well why does it why won't anybody play

1166
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:44,880
with me and the answer to that is well you don't play fair and people gave you a chance a few times

1167
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:52,000
and you demonstrated that and like there's no coming back so yeah and the reason I went off on

1168
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:59,600
this tangent is because you asked me your mission now what am I doing now you bet you bet and I

1169
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:08,640
think that along the way in my career in the in the navy I was so ingrained with the fact of

1170
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:19,440
trying to be a good teammate yeah that when I retired I kept just trying to help people out

1171
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:24,320
and say hey you know what I I I can teach you something about leadership do you want to know

1172
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:28,320
something about leadership I can I can maybe I can help you with this or I can at least talk you

1173
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:33,120
through and maybe I can share some stories of what I've learned about human nature and and that way

1174
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:38,160
you don't have to learn those lessons by beating your head up against the wall and and then maybe

1175
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:43,200
I can help you out with hey putting some stuff together that you can take as supplements and

1176
02:01:43,200 --> 02:01:47,280
that's going to make you a little bit healthier and stronger and and and by the way we're we're

1177
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:52,320
trying to rebuild our community in New England where we came from where we used to have a bunch

1178
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:57,200
of factories making clothes and maybe we could rebuild that and that way so great so there's

1179
02:01:57,200 --> 02:02:02,960
a question and so so tell me tell me about that so because it's it's kind of a surprise right

1180
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:08,320
to you have a clothing line I think well that's so that's so funny and I that that

1181
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:13,520
jockel has a clothing line it's it's so cool that that's the case and not not expected so

1182
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:20,320
I knew there was a backstory there so I don't imagine that it stems from an obsession with fashion

1183
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:27,360
you called it do okay so so what happened and and why did you get interested in it and what's

1184
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:35,440
going on okay so I was you know I started my podcast and I was interacting with people and I

1185
02:02:35,440 --> 02:02:42,800
talk about jujitsu a lot Brazilian jujitsu I'm a very big supporter of people training jujitsu

1186
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:47,520
and mixed martial arts in general but I am absolutely a jujitsu guy so a lot of people

1187
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:52,560
started doing jujitsu and they started training and and so they would ask me that the the uniform

1188
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:59,920
for jujitsu is called a gi and people would ask me hey I'm starting jujitsu or I started jujitsu

1189
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:07,600
and I need to get a gi what kind should I get and I knew from having gays over the years that

1190
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:17,040
gays were made in China and whatever horrible slave labor scenarios are happening there and

1191
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:22,640
I knew that there was also one company up in Maine and I'm from New England as well one company

1192
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:29,360
up in Maine that was actually making these jujitsu gays in America and and I had seen

1193
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:34,640
them online and and the story was kind of presented online that this guy named Pete

1194
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:41,520
he was a New England kid and saw the factories get shut down and we all you know we all did that

1195
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:46,480
we all saw when I was growing up the factories there was no there was no one in them yep and and

1196
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:54,560
he saw that and he was also a jujitsu guy and so he wanted to make gays jujitsu gays in America

1197
02:03:55,280 --> 02:04:00,960
as he started to go down that path he realized that the material that you would get to sew

1198
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:06,000
together a gi was not produced anywhere in America so he decided he was going to get a loom

1199
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:13,520
to weave this material and he starts asking around and poking around and eventually finds

1200
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:19,120
that in a 500,000 square foot abandoned factory in Lewiston, Maine there is one loom that hadn't

1201
02:04:19,120 --> 02:04:27,520
been shipped overseas and the woman that kind of owned it was planning to one day put that loom

1202
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:34,320
in a museum and he said I'll buy it from you and so he bought this massive loom you know it's as big

1203
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:40,320
as a couple beds put together weighs thousands and thousands of pounds and he gets some of his

1204
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:44,960
buddies and they go and drag this loom out of this factory and they take it apart what a cool

1205
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:51,600
finding yeah what a remarkable piece of equipment completely remarkable and he finds a guy he finds

1206
02:04:51,600 --> 02:04:56,800
people that knew about these things find some old timers there was a guy named Lenny who's since

1207
02:04:56,800 --> 02:05:02,800
died but he used to work on looms and he hired him and said why we he says what do you want to do

1208
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:08,400
he said we got to make this thing work so he starts making he starts weaving this material gets this

1209
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:13,600
thing up and running so one day and I'm following this story I've been following I've been following

1210
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:20,160
that story for three or four years and I'd actually reached out to him and said hey man I know you're

1211
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:25,120
up in Maine I'm from up there um what do you think you know can I get some of your geese I'd like to

1212
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:28,720
have some of your geese and how much are they or whatever and I wouldn't even hear back from him

1213
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:34,320
because he's in Maine these guys you know I make fun of him because he's up in Maine he's in

1214
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:42,560
Farmington Maine population 7000 so anyways one day I'm doing like a live social media interaction

1215
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:48,000
with people and someone says hey I'm just starting to get to what kind of geese should I get and I

1216
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:52,080
said I'll tell you what you should get an origin geese and by the way I said if anybody on here

1217
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:56,240
knows this guy named Pete Roberts that runs that company up there if you could please tell him I

1218
02:05:56,240 --> 02:06:01,600
want to talk to him that'd be really cool so a few days go by and I get like a message that says hey

1219
02:06:01,600 --> 02:06:07,040
I reached out through my business connections and I found this guy Pete Roberts here's his number

1220
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:14,480
or whatever here's his email so I say all right great so we set up a Skype call this was a few

1221
02:06:14,480 --> 02:06:22,640
years ago and we meet each other and we talk for four hours and I come walking out of my office

1222
02:06:22,640 --> 02:06:27,040
and my wife says it sounds like you were talking to yourself in there because we were just you know

1223
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:35,200
we were on the same page so I ended up flying up to Maine we had a steak and we had a handshake

1224
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:44,400
and we merged and started working together and what was great was he had this great people up there

1225
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:49,040
and was building these geese but he didn't have a platform he's in Farmington Maine

1226
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:53,920
so there's not a bunch of jiu-jitsu studios in Farmington Maine well I had luckily a platform

1227
02:06:53,920 --> 02:06:58,960
to talk to people right well and no matter how good your product man and everyone needs to know

1228
02:06:58,960 --> 02:07:04,320
this the world will not beat a pathway to your doorway for your damn product you need to pay

1229
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:09,760
attention to sales and marketing and you can't be contemptuous of it it's like who the hell's

1230
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:17,360
gonna buy something they don't know about so we shook hands we started working together and

1231
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:21,920
once so then we started making jiu-jitsu geese and believe it or not you know now we had a bunch

1232
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:25,600
people that wanted these jiu-jitsu geese because they're the best in the world they're made in America

1233
02:07:25,600 --> 02:07:33,600
they're made by Americans with their American cotton and woven on American loom so it's just

1234
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:41,200
it's a beautiful thing it's a beautiful thing and and one day I was in the airport and I'm

1235
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:45,600
sitting there in the airport as we're selling a bunch of jiu-jitsu geese and I'm looking around

1236
02:07:45,600 --> 02:07:51,840
and I called up P and I said hey P I said how many people do you actually know that do jiu-jitsu

1237
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:57,600
and he said he's like I don't know like maybe 50 or 100 and I said how many people do you know

1238
02:07:57,680 --> 02:08:04,400
that wear jeans and he said everybody and I said why aren't we making jeans and he said

1239
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:10,720
let me let me go so the next thing we did was we started making jeans because because

1240
02:08:12,720 --> 02:08:19,520
because the iconic American jeans that you wear aren't made in America the iconic American jeans

1241
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:25,680
that people think represent America they're not made in America and and that's wrong and and the

1242
02:08:25,680 --> 02:08:31,440
other crazy thing about this is you know do you make good jeans we make the best jeans in the world

1243
02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:36,240
do they have spandex in them they do they do they have their they have a little bit of stretch in

1244
02:08:36,240 --> 02:08:42,160
them we've got a heavy pair and a lighter pair and yeah they're it's great and where can people find

1245
02:08:42,160 --> 02:08:49,280
these? how do they look for them? originusa.com guys if you go to jaco.com you can find all this

1246
02:08:49,360 --> 02:08:57,600
stuff and and um so we started everybody needs good jeans then we started making boots and

1247
02:08:57,600 --> 02:09:02,080
and we're making everything we're making you know we we started making a bunch of supplements and

1248
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:08,560
that started from I drink tea another shocking thing you might want to know it is it is shocking

1249
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:14,560
I'm married to a Brit and at some point I started drinking tea and so I started making tea

1250
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:21,280
and then I started making other supplements and and again it was like make high quality stuff

1251
02:09:22,160 --> 02:09:28,960
that works and people need it they want it and we're doing that thing of being a teammate

1252
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:38,000
of helping people out so that I knew there was a good story in that clothing yeah it's a great

1253
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:43,520
story it's a great story absolutely if you've ever seen a I don't know maybe you could help me

1254
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:47,280
with my with my personality you know what I like about that too I've learned something in the last

1255
02:09:47,280 --> 02:09:56,960
while like I I noticed very much that people allow a casual and unconscious contempt to stop them from

1256
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:04,560
well to elevate the status of what they're doing I would say but also to

1257
02:10:05,680 --> 02:10:10,480
to allow them the luxury of not having to consider the importance of all the things

1258
02:10:10,480 --> 02:10:18,480
they're not doing now and that stops them from taking opportunities so you know well

1259
02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:24,240
it's I was watching the show last night it was The Devil Wears Prada and it was about fashion

1260
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:30,560
industry and this girl who starts you instantly thought of me absolutely I thought that's right

1261
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:36,960
the Jock Jocko fashion special but this girl she has contempt for the fashion industry you know

1262
02:10:37,040 --> 02:10:41,360
and that's portrayed as a moral virtue and I wasn't on her side to begin with I thought no you

1263
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:46,160
know there's probably something to this and what you should do is shut up and learn about it before

1264
02:10:46,160 --> 02:10:51,600
you criticize it but it's more comfortable in some sense to have contempt for things you know and

1265
02:10:51,600 --> 02:10:57,360
it's so interesting to talk to you about your clothing line you know you saw opportunity there

1266
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:04,080
in all sorts of ways and it fitted into this context of let's say of being a broader service

1267
02:11:04,080 --> 02:11:08,320
and because you didn't have contempt for it at all at any level for the machinery for the

1268
02:11:08,320 --> 02:11:13,200
manufacturing for the fact of making clothing for having your name associated with that for all of

1269
02:11:13,200 --> 02:11:18,720
that it then it enables you to see an opportunity there and to do something immediately and then

1270
02:11:18,720 --> 02:11:25,040
to make an enterprise grow and work and so that's another thing is that that that casual contempt

1271
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:31,280
for what you can't do that's that's a real ethical mistake yeah that one will definitely I see

1272
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:37,600
among academics you know there's always contempt for businessman and and and and the immorality

1273
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:42,400
of the capitalist enterprise and then I see among businessmen you know contempt for intellectualism

1274
02:11:42,400 --> 02:11:47,200
in the ivory tower and I think that's not doing either of you guys much good you know because

1275
02:11:47,200 --> 02:11:53,520
you both have something to bring to the table in a real sense and some appreciation for what the other

1276
02:11:53,520 --> 02:11:58,640
one knows that you don't is well worth everyone's attempt and then everybody gets to win too it's

1277
02:11:58,640 --> 02:12:03,440
like well great man you've got this business enterprise more power to you and and then you

1278
02:12:03,440 --> 02:12:08,400
can say too well you know great you teach all these people and you have this advanced learning and

1279
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:14,320
isn't the world better because we can both bring that to the table no need for for that envy not

1280
02:12:14,320 --> 02:12:22,160
at all just it just contaminates things yeah unless you let your ego slide in there and

1281
02:12:22,160 --> 02:12:27,760
and you start to think well I've been studied so hard and yet I'm only making whatever I'm making

1282
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:33,040
as a yeah well that's that's a huge part look it's a huge part of the culture war I believe is that

1283
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:38,880
there's a there's a tremendous resentment in the university about the fact that

1284
02:12:40,400 --> 02:12:47,040
high level intellectual endeavor doesn't attract disproportionate salary when other occupations do

1285
02:12:47,680 --> 02:12:54,000
but it certainly has no shortage of other rewards you know absolute job security being one of them

1286
02:12:54,080 --> 02:13:00,400
and freedom for that matter so anyways anyways I'm actually I've been surprised that

1287
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:06,880
in the all you know there's all this talk in America right now about the divisiveness in America

1288
02:13:06,880 --> 02:13:13,600
and I don't yeah I've been surprised that the the the ego hasn't come up more often because

1289
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:20,880
you mean as a topic as a as a as a causal effect yeah yeah okay sure yeah of the fact that

1290
02:13:21,680 --> 02:13:28,400
well I go to have a conversation with someone and I just think that I'm right I think that

1291
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:34,080
my viewpoints are right and your viewpoints are wrong and worse worse not just wrong

1292
02:13:34,720 --> 02:13:41,920
contemptible that's like the ultimate expression of wrong right they're beneath my consideration

1293
02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:47,600
right yeah and that's that's not good that's definitely not good how do I how do I listen

1294
02:13:47,680 --> 02:13:53,920
to anything that you say how do I how do I find any common ground with you if I think that what you

1295
02:13:53,920 --> 02:13:58,480
think is contemptible and so therefore we can't have a conversation if we don't have a conversation

1296
02:13:58,480 --> 02:14:02,560
we can't find any mutual ground and that means we can't find solutions to the problems that we're

1297
02:14:02,560 --> 02:14:08,480
facing and yes and it means when push comes to shove we have to fight yes it does yeah

1298
02:14:09,600 --> 02:14:12,000
I'm here to tell you that's not a good option

1299
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:24,240
you know that's a good place to stop fair enough that was great man thank you appreciate it I loved

1300
02:14:24,240 --> 02:14:32,800
it well thank you appreciate it yeah so it's good to see you it's good to see you too and it's so

1301
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:37,600
it's so nice to see that that all of what you're talking about is finding its audience

1302
02:14:38,560 --> 02:14:44,720
I like the kids books too we never talked about them oh yeah the kids books I I I feel like

1303
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:56,640
there is no more there's no better gratification for me than the handwritten letters the the the

1304
02:14:56,640 --> 02:15:00,960
emails that I get but mostly the handwritten letters from kids that are six seven eight nine

1305
02:15:00,960 --> 02:15:05,600
years old just did my first pull-up got an a on my math test oh isn't that cool

1306
02:15:06,400 --> 02:15:11,600
it's right yes I get better how could you have anything better than that to know that you were

1307
02:15:11,600 --> 02:15:15,360
part of that so so tell me about that maybe we'll stop with that tell me about that

1308
02:15:16,240 --> 02:15:22,160
like tell tell me about the kids books how many you've self-published them how many have sold well

1309
02:15:22,160 --> 02:15:28,960
I so I didn't I didn't self-publish all of them okay I the first two went through normal publisher

1310
02:15:29,680 --> 02:15:35,440
and what happened was so so the first one is called way the warrior kid and and right

1311
02:15:35,440 --> 02:15:42,160
basically I have four kids myself three daughters one son as I was raising my kids I couldn't really

1312
02:15:42,160 --> 02:15:49,200
find books that articulated the values that I might want my children to be reading about

1313
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:56,720
and so I wrote my own books so the the first one way the warrior kid it's a kid he's bullied

1314
02:15:56,720 --> 02:16:01,360
he doesn't know his timetable so he thinks he's stupid he doesn't know how to swim so he can't

1315
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:07,360
do any of the fun stuff that the other kids are doing and he's he's getting bullied common things

1316
02:16:07,360 --> 02:16:13,120
that kids face and he kind of breaks down last day of school everything kind of hits him at once

1317
02:16:13,120 --> 02:16:18,480
and he goes home and he remembers that his uncle is coming to stay with him for the summer and his

1318
02:16:18,480 --> 02:16:23,600
uncle his uncle is in the SEAL teams and he presents all these problems that he's having to his uncle

1319
02:16:23,600 --> 02:16:27,520
and his uncle says listen we can solve these problems but you got to commit it's going to

1320
02:16:27,520 --> 02:16:32,800
take discipline it's going to take hard work teaches the kid how to study teaches the kid

1321
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:37,360
how to make flash cards teaches the kid how to eat right teaches the kid how to work out

1322
02:16:37,360 --> 02:16:40,400
brings the kid did you get two classes so he learns how to defend himself

1323
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:46,560
kid goes back to school and he's he's in a much better place and and so then that series carries

1324
02:16:46,560 --> 02:16:52,160
on with different types of situations that kids get into and so I wrote the first one way the

1325
02:16:52,160 --> 02:16:57,680
warrior kid the second one marks mission and then I had written a kid's book a kid's book called

1326
02:16:57,680 --> 02:17:07,760
Mikey and the Dragons and and I had written it I finished it in August and I talked to my publisher

1327
02:17:07,760 --> 02:17:11,520
and I said hey you know I wrote this kid's book I'm sorry you know it sorry I didn't let you know

1328
02:17:11,520 --> 02:17:15,760
earlier but I really want the book to come out for Christmas and my publisher said yeah well you

1329
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:19,280
know that's not really gonna happen and I said yeah but I really wanted to come out by Christmas

1330
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:26,240
and by this time I think I'd written like three New York Times bestselling books for whatever

1331
02:17:26,240 --> 02:17:32,640
that's worth so it wasn't like I was you know scrapping around trying to throw this together I

1332
02:17:32,640 --> 02:17:39,600
had a pretty good vision of what to do here and I think there's a lot yeah so I said please can I

1333
02:17:39,600 --> 02:17:46,160
you know get this thing published by Christmas and they and they said they said there's no

1334
02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:54,880
scenario where this book by Christmas and I said I said are you sure and they yeah yeah

1335
02:17:54,880 --> 02:18:00,800
and I said watch this and so I started publishing about a week yep I started my own publishing

1336
02:18:00,800 --> 02:18:06,880
company we finished the the art inside the book and the book came out before Thanksgiving

1337
02:18:07,760 --> 02:18:15,520
and that was the beginning of of jocco publishing and so yes I've published it and then I just wrote

1338
02:18:15,520 --> 02:18:21,840
the the latest Way the Warrior Kid book Way the Warrior Kid 4 field manual and and again the most

1339
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:26,560
rewarding thing that that happens to me on a daily basis is I get to open up letters from kids that

1340
02:18:26,560 --> 02:18:32,560
are seven eight nine ten eleven years old that just you know did their first pull up or ran a mile in

1341
02:18:32,560 --> 02:18:38,240
a certain amount of time or they so cool they like it's so cool to see that because I mean

1342
02:18:39,600 --> 02:18:45,680
it's it's an unbelievably deep instinct that makes that satisfying like I have the same

1343
02:18:45,680 --> 02:18:52,560
experience I don't ever see anything as satisfying as getting a message from someone who says

1344
02:18:53,680 --> 02:18:58,640
I've followed what you've been talking about and here's what I've done that's improved my life because

1345
02:18:58,640 --> 02:19:04,800
of it it's this is there's a you know when you read online comments the negative ones

1346
02:19:05,840 --> 02:19:13,600
are salient right they've got potency but and people are wired to feel more negative emotion than

1347
02:19:13,600 --> 02:19:19,520
positive emotion it it affects us more more we feel a loss more strongly than we feel in

1348
02:19:19,520 --> 02:19:28,000
equivalent gain the one exception to that might be those kinds of letters they're so salient and

1349
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:32,640
it's really curious I mean that must be the deep that must be something like the deep instinct of

1350
02:19:32,640 --> 02:19:39,920
fatherhood that that pleasure that's intrinsic in watching someone who's younger younger generally

1351
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:47,120
speaking not always but generally speaking thrive it's so satisfying and yeah I think that goes back

1352
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:54,320
to the to the concept of being a good teammate yes definitely it's the deepest part of it and you're

1353
02:19:54,320 --> 02:20:01,520
helping someone get on the correct path when they're eight years old and you you know when I

1354
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:08,080
people say all me all the time the parents write me too the parents say hey you know thank you I got

1355
02:20:08,080 --> 02:20:14,640
more out of this book than my kids did right they say as well that the the the way that these books

1356
02:20:14,640 --> 02:20:19,840
come together it's like you're being a good teammate because you're putting someone on the right path

1357
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:24,400
at a young age I always people say I wish I would have had this book when I was right right well

1358
02:20:24,400 --> 02:20:31,200
yes absolutely me too that's a father between pages that it is exactly that because the fundamental

1359
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:36,640
role of a father as far as I can tell is encouragement and I mean that technically is that

1360
02:20:37,440 --> 02:20:46,160
you your job is to instill courage in or to or to or to encourage courage I suppose in in in your

1361
02:20:46,160 --> 02:20:51,280
children to make them resilient in that manner to make them confident in their ability to face the

1362
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:56,000
world but also able to face the world and that warrior kid book it's such a different approach

1363
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:00,880
to the problem of bullying it reminded me when you were talking about it about the Simpsons there's

1364
02:21:00,880 --> 02:21:06,320
Nelson months is the bully in the Simpsons and he's quite a complex character actually and if he

1365
02:21:06,320 --> 02:21:11,600
bullies you there's a pretty high probability that the reason he's doing it is because you're doing

1366
02:21:11,680 --> 02:21:16,560
something stupid and contemptible so he's got this kind of corrective function

1367
02:21:16,560 --> 02:21:21,920
and he's not a bad kid even though he's a bully some of his bully compatriots are bad kids but

1368
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:27,120
he's not he's from a family that's not doing well he has his reasons for for what he's like

1369
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:32,640
but he is kind of a corrective you know and there's a scene too in The Simpsons where one of the

1370
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:39,600
teacher says to Ralph poor Ralph the children are right to laugh at you Ralph which is a hilarious

1371
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:46,160
line but also absolutely terrible but you know in your warrior kid book the message there is

1372
02:21:49,760 --> 02:21:55,440
one way of dealing with your inadequacies is to rid yourself of them

1373
02:21:56,560 --> 02:22:00,960
and it isn't self-evident that people who point out your inadequacies are your enemy

1374
02:22:02,640 --> 02:22:06,320
now that doesn't mean that bullies can't exploit and it doesn't mean that bullying

1375
02:22:06,320 --> 02:22:13,760
isn't reprehensible but by the same token you know critics a critic who points out a weakness

1376
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:18,480
has actually offered you a pathway to development a true pathway to development

1377
02:22:20,400 --> 02:22:26,640
so and your your attitude to the kid was look kid no one's going to laugh at you if you're the

1378
02:22:26,640 --> 02:22:32,720
best swimmer or maybe you don't even have to be the best but but you could swim you could be

1379
02:22:32,720 --> 02:22:40,400
stronger you know you could you could elevate yourself yeah it's um it's it's it's so fun to

1380
02:22:40,400 --> 02:22:44,480
write these books because i mean i got first of all i got to experience it and you know i always

1381
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:48,400
tell people people say oh did you get bullied because i'm i'm a bigger guy now i was like oh

1382
02:22:48,400 --> 02:22:52,240
when you're 10 you get bullied by 11 year olds that's right exactly always going to be somebody

1383
02:22:52,240 --> 02:22:58,080
that's bigger than you um in the second book the bully is like a psychological bully his name is

1384
02:22:58,080 --> 02:23:04,640
Nathan James and Nathan he's not physically threatening you but he's he's making fun of you

1385
02:23:04,640 --> 02:23:08,560
and he's picking on you and he'll take it to the point where he might you know feel some

1386
02:23:08,560 --> 02:23:15,360
repercussions but then he'd be quiet and so you know this kid mark says to his uncle hey i'm gonna

1387
02:23:15,360 --> 02:23:24,480
fight this kid i'm gonna fight him and the uncle says well okay if it comes to that but before you

1388
02:23:24,480 --> 02:23:32,080
fight him so that's when you published yourself i presume uh no no no this was this was still this

1389
02:23:32,080 --> 02:23:39,200
was still um this is book two oh really okay well my mistake i it's surprising well that was a while

1390
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:43,760
ago you think you could get a book like that published now i'm not a hundred percent sure

1391
02:23:43,760 --> 02:23:47,440
i've got another i've got a i wrote a novel that's coming out which would you probably touch on

1392
02:23:48,320 --> 02:23:54,080
which which went through like multiple screenings to make sure that it wasn't offensive and whatever

1393
02:23:54,080 --> 02:24:00,400
else uh Nathan James the bully he picks on the kids but he talks and and his uncle you know

1394
02:24:00,400 --> 02:24:04,960
the kid mark says hey i want to fight this kid and his uncle says okay if it comes to that but

1395
02:24:04,960 --> 02:24:10,800
before you fight him i want you to gather some intel he says what do you mean gather some intel

1396
02:24:10,800 --> 02:24:17,120
i want you to collect some intelligence i want to know why he acts this way and so he watches

1397
02:24:18,160 --> 02:24:22,880
mark watches this kid Nathan James for a couple days and he says goes back and reports to his uncle

1398
02:24:22,880 --> 02:24:30,080
this kid he he doesn't eat healthy he eats potato chips half a bag of potato chips he's dirty he

1399
02:24:30,080 --> 02:24:35,040
doesn't change his clothes his socks don't match he's got holes in his jeans he's a slob totally

1400
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:41,360
lacks discipline i think i should fight him and then he says well why do you think he's like that

1401
02:24:42,480 --> 02:24:46,560
you need to do further intel and i'm sure you can see where this is going eventually follows him

1402
02:24:46,560 --> 02:24:51,120
and realize the kid is kind of on his own and the reason he has a bag of potato chips a half a

1403
02:24:51,120 --> 02:24:56,560
bag of potato chips is because his mom's not home at night and there's no dad to be found and

1404
02:24:56,560 --> 02:25:01,040
and we don't even know what's going on but he lives in some in some apartment building above

1405
02:25:01,040 --> 02:25:06,000
a auto repair shop and and maybe his jeans wears the same jeans every day because that's the only

1406
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:13,120
pair he's got and so instead of fighting this kid maybe you should try and help him and that's

1407
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:19,040
where that goes so yeah there's a there's another novel that i wrote which is coming out in the fall

1408
02:25:19,040 --> 02:25:28,000
is um it it's it's it's definitely going to be interesting what the critics say about it i'm

1409
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:34,400
looking forward to it i'm looking forward to their um their assessment it's about a it's about a

1410
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:44,640
two brothers one brother is kind of a handsome kind of street smart kid smart good-looking the other

1411
02:25:44,640 --> 02:25:55,200
brother is uh got some kind of a unidentified disorder mental disorder mental handicap and

1412
02:25:55,200 --> 02:26:02,640
basically is an autistic guy and he's obsessed with washing machines and he works at a laundry mat

1413
02:26:03,680 --> 02:26:11,440
and um well the the laundry mat is eventually going to be up for sale and the brother the younger

1414
02:26:11,440 --> 02:26:17,920
brother who is a little bit more street smart decides if that happens my my older brother is

1415
02:26:17,920 --> 02:26:21,920
never going to be happy again because he's not going to have this laundry mat and he decides

1416
02:26:21,920 --> 02:26:29,120
he's going to do something to get money to buy that laundry mat and the only way he can figure

1417
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:33,520
out to do that is by doing something that's not legal so he goes for it and well that's the story

1418
02:26:33,520 --> 02:26:38,160
but and that's coming out when comes out in the fall it's called final spin

1419
02:26:38,720 --> 02:26:41,280
how long have you been working on that

1420
02:26:42,800 --> 02:26:52,000
huh well i write about i probably i wrote an original draft of it probably 15 years ago

1421
02:26:53,280 --> 02:26:59,040
and then just kind of set it aside and then this is then i i dusted it off because it never left

1422
02:26:59,040 --> 02:27:04,160
my mind uh-huh story never left my mind because ultimately it's about a you know it's about can

1423
02:27:04,160 --> 02:27:08,800
you be happy and what kind of sacrifices are you willing to make to be happy and what about people

1424
02:27:08,800 --> 02:27:11,440
that are stuck in a rut you know when i was growing up there was all these kids that were

1425
02:27:11,440 --> 02:27:17,920
smarter than me and funnier than me and better athletes than me and and i would look around and

1426
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:25,200
they would get stuck in a rut right right and not really do anything and it would be a little bit sad

1427
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:30,800
yes very and you know i was lucky enough like you said i i joined the navy and all of a sudden

1428
02:27:30,800 --> 02:27:34,720
had a goal and had an aim and wanted to be a good seal and that was enough to kind of put me in the

1429
02:27:34,720 --> 02:27:40,560
right direction yeah so what what's next what do you want where do you want to take this

1430
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:46,000
what's your ambition my you're you're teaching people you're communicating with them on a very

1431
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:51,360
broad level that's where do you see this going if it went where you want it to go

1432
02:27:52,160 --> 02:27:57,280
the the ambition the goal is to help more people is to help more people help more kids

1433
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:02,400
become more confident help more leaders do a better job of leading their teams

1434
02:28:03,280 --> 02:28:09,360
help people be on a better path in their life healthier and and doing productive things in

1435
02:28:09,360 --> 02:28:15,680
the world that's i think the best thing i can do right now at this point yeah well that just seems

1436
02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:22,720
like generally speaking that just seems like the best i think well once it isn't clear why you would

1437
02:28:22,800 --> 02:28:27,280
be motivated to do anything else it's like that actually is the best thing you talked about these

1438
02:28:27,280 --> 02:28:32,560
letters it's like well what could you do that would be better than that i mean if you were as greedy

1439
02:28:32,560 --> 02:28:40,320
as you could possibly be you can't get better than that so it's so rewarding so yeah and and again

1440
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:46,160
the biggest reward is is when you when you get a letter from somebody that decided they weren't

1441
02:28:46,160 --> 02:28:50,400
going to kill themselves yeah yeah right because they heard you talking on the podcast or they read

1442
02:28:50,400 --> 02:28:54,960
they read the book discipline equals freedom and they said wait a second i'm trapped why am i trapped

1443
02:28:55,600 --> 02:29:02,000
trapped because i'm blaming other people i'm trapped because i'm not sticking to the things

1444
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:07,440
that i know i should do right and they get on the right path and you know they always say you

1445
02:29:07,440 --> 02:29:12,560
changed my life and i always say i didn't change your life you did which is the truth

1446
02:29:12,560 --> 02:29:20,560
thanks a lot thanks for having me man good seeing you good see you too
