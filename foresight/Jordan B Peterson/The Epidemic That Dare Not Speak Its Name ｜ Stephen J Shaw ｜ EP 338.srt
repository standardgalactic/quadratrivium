1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
You should accept yourself just the way you are.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,360
What does that say about who I should become?

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,960
Is that just now off the table because I'm already good enough in every way?

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,800
So am I done or something?

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,760
Get the hell up.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,760
Get your act together.

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,600
Adopt some responsibility.

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,880
Put your life together.

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,160
Develop a vision.

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,640
Unfold all those manifold possibilities that lurk within.

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,480
Be a force for good in the world,

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,240
and that'll be the adventure of your life.

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,240
The world's falling birth rate isn't on the list of major threats to life as we know it,

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,440
but it soon will be.

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,240
Taxes are decent as soar,

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,720
pension systems will become unsustainable,

17
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,280
while our healthcare systems won't be able to cope

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,840
with the race of old people to take care of

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,400
compared to the shrinking number of taxpayers.

20
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,040
Businesses will struggle to find workers to hire,

21
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,720
school closures will accelerate,

22
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,520
while social care will continually be sliced.

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,240
And they say it's an economic time bomb.

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,520
I'm worried about the birth rate.

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,960
Most people think we have like too many people on the planet,

26
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,360
but actually this is an outdated view.

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,920
I think that the biggest problem the world will face in 20 years is population collapse.

28
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,680
Collapse.

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,120
I want to emphasize this.

30
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,200
The biggest issue in 20 years will be population collapse.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,720
Hello everyone, I'm here today talking to Mr. Stephen Jay Shaw.

32
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,840
Stephen is a British national who has studied and lived on three continents.

33
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,440
He trained as a computer engineer and then as a data scientist

34
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,200
before starting his first film project, BirthGap, at age 49.

35
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,280
He maintains the position of president of the data analytics company he co-founded,

36
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,920
Autometrics Analytics LLC.

37
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,200
Stephen holds an MBA graduate business degree from ISG in Paris, France,

38
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,160
and is continuing his studies at the Harvard Extension School.

39
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,680
Looking very much forward today to delving into the issue of declining

40
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,160
birth rates and population collapse, something that's not particularly on everyone's rate,

41
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:31,360
are and the issue of the invisible epidemic of unplanned childlessness.

42
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,040
Why are people having so few children?

43
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,640
The more I read about falling birth rates, everything was negative.

44
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,040
You enter a downward spiral as you have fewer and fewer children.

45
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,960
You have fewer and fewer future mothers, which in turn goes on and on and on.

46
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,640
And no society in history has been known to come out of that spiral.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,600
So I'm talking today with Stephen Jay Shaw, who's produced a documentary,

48
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,760
BirthGap, that was originally released in its first version in 2021 and later version in 2022.

49
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,560
And he's been spending an awful lot of time delving into this particular problem.

50
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,960
And so we're going to walk through what he's learned.

51
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,200
Good to see you.

52
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,720
Thank you for inviting me.

53
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,320
Hey, thanks for agreeing to talk.

54
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,280
So let's start with your background.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,840
We could walk through what you've been up to biographically,

56
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,120
first of all, to situate it.

57
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,920
And then you can expand on that to the degree that you're willing to enable.

58
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,840
So historically, for the last 20 years, I've been involved in data analytics,

59
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,520
what we now call data science.

60
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,720
I'm a part statistician, part coder.

61
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,120
Worked with some great academics and PhDs that we have on staff

62
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,000
and coming up with academic models, forecasting models for industries,

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,760
mainly in the automotive sector.

64
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,080
We try and do short-term forecasting.

65
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,680
What might people purchase?

66
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,640
What should car companies build?

67
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,000
What should they market?

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,680
What should they give for incentives done to a very minute level?

69
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,960
This is a private venture?

70
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,520
It is.

71
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,400
So it's a corporation that offers these services?

72
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,520
Yeah, it's a small niche corporation that's been offering services

73
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,080
to the world's largest corporations for 20 years.

74
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,840
And how did you get involved in that?

75
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,240
It was a startup in London 20 years ago.

76
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,400
I personally moved to the US to...

77
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,480
We got a contract with Nissan North America.

78
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,920
It took me to LA.

79
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,760
And following that, yeah, I spent like 15 years following that company hands-on

80
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,160
until around 2015.

81
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,320
Bizarrely.

82
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,920
And I should explain that my lifelong learner had gone.

83
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,360
I got accepted into Harvard Extension School to become a degree candidate

84
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,600
to keep my data science skills up to date.

85
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,000
And I was presented with some data that I just couldn't believe on falling birth rates.

86
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,280
So as someone who is involved in forecasting, albeit short-term forecasting,

87
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,480
realizing that we've got this fundamental problem with birth rates that's ultimately

88
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,000
going to affect, well, not just the number of potential car buyers.

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,080
I mean, that's the smallest problem in this overall.

90
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,960
But that was something I felt almost ashamed of.

91
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,080
Why do I know this?

92
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,320
And then you expand that to what is this going to mean for the planet?

93
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,000
And as a father or three, my three children were just about still teenagers then,

94
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,720
I felt a sense of failure that I hadn't been preparing my children for the world

95
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,160
they were about to enter into.

96
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,120
You know, we all, I think, are led into the belief that sure,

97
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,040
that the world's population is growing perhaps exponentially still.

98
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,720
That's what I would have said at that time, based on what I was learning.

99
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:58,160
And I had no idea that the actual dynamics of everything from

100
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,440
how work is going to be like, to how society is going to be like,

101
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,720
to how pension systems are going to be like, is fundamentally flawed.

102
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,160
And at that moment, I realized something's wrong, because you know what?

103
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,440
The same trend was showing up for Germany and Italy and Japan.

104
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,280
South Korea.

105
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,000
Yeah, well, South Korea was just a little bit later,

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,480
just a little bit later, which was interesting.

107
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,600
But something triggered in the early 1970s in Japan, Germany, Italy,

108
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,560
and you can add Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Austria,

109
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,280
to cause a series of parallel trends.

110
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,440
And yet, what I was reading from experts was that these are localized problems.

111
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,080
Japan, it's work like balance.

112
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,040
That in Germany, it's something called Rabenmutter,

113
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,040
which is the idea that parts of Germany, even today,

114
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,160
for a woman to have a child and go straight back to work,

115
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,560
is really something that culturally shouldn't be done.

116
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,400
So that might cause some people to delay parenthood.

117
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,280
In Spain and Italy, it was down to high unemployment among the youth.

118
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,840
Other areas, it was gender balance, et cetera.

119
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,600
So all these localized reasons were being proposed.

120
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,920
For me, as a data scientist, you could see clearly,

121
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,120
and if I can give you an analogy, it's one of your own.

122
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,680
You were talking to Lex Freeman.

123
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,800
He talked about the dragon, I think, in terms of the environment context.

124
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,680
If someone finds a dragon and they scream, there's a dragon.

125
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,160
And I love the analogy, and I since saw that you use dragons quite a lot,

126
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,520
so I thought, I might too.

127
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,600
And it's like you found this little dragon in Japan,

128
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,520
and the same kind of dragon in Germany and Italy at the same time,

129
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,840
and they're starting to get bigger, and I saw.

130
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,520
So they're lizards to begin with.

131
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,720
Right. I mean, they're tiny.

132
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,360
They're the size of a kitten, I think, is an analogy I saw.

133
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,960
And they're getting bigger, and then suddenly they're appearing

134
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,600
in other neighboring countries, and it's growing, growing, growing from there.

135
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,840
So the idea that these are localized issues to me just did not make sense.

136
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,400
So why do you think you were struck to begin with

137
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,960
by the fact that birth rates were plateauing or declining?

138
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,160
I mean, because the typical response to that would be either, so what?

139
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,320
There's too many people on the planet anyways, or actually, it's a net good.

140
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,200
So now you said you're in a private company.

141
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,680
Now, I should let everybody watching and listening know that

142
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,640
one of the markers for the trustworthiness of a data analytic company

143
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,200
is that people will actually pay for their information.

144
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:44,800
And so it doesn't necessarily mean that a private data analytic company is credible,

145
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,720
but it does mean at least that they've been able to demonstrate their credibility enough

146
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,400
so that they have paying customers, and that's not an easy thing to manage.

147
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,200
And so you were doing short-term forecasting that was integrated into the capitalist economy,

148
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,960
let's say, to help people plan their product development and so forth.

149
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:06,480
But you came across this data at a much broader level indicating plateauing birth rate,

150
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,320
or population growth.

151
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,600
Why did that disturb you?

152
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,120
Why did you think that was a problem?

153
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,880
Because birth rates less than replacement level spiral downwards.

154
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,240
They never stop.

155
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,240
If you have fewer children than are required to replace the parents generation,

156
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,360
once that generation grows up, unless birth rates change,

157
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,360
which they don't historically, they stay low once they're low,

158
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,960
you're going to have fewer people again.

159
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,400
So you see it as a positive feedback loop?

160
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:38,800
It is.

161
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,960
And when you then look up, well, you want to find examples of societies

162
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,440
coming from low birth rates going back to replacement level,

163
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,840
and you realize there are no examples.

164
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,680
In fact, there's no known historical examples anywhere.

165
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,360
Do we have enough of a historical track to consider that a concern?

166
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,400
In modern times, if you look at the number of countries who've fallen to birth rates of 1.7,

167
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:12,960
1.6, 1.5, when you have no single example of a country going back to replacement level,

168
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,080
we should be concerned.

169
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,600
In fact, we should be very concerned.

170
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,160
I know places like Quebec, for example, in Canada with very, very low birth rate,

171
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,880
have tried to institute government policies that, for example,

172
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,760
make daycare in principle more accessible to young women and young families,

173
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,040
although that's had pretty much zero impact on the outcome.

174
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,120
I know that Hungary has put forward a series of policy transformations

175
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,560
on the family support front.

176
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,480
And my belief is, from what I've read,

177
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,560
is that they've at least stopped the birth rate decrease and increased it slightly.

178
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,760
So that's the only—I mean, Quebec didn't work at all.

179
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,880
Hungary looks like there's some—they're still way below replacement,

180
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,400
so it hasn't rectified the problem in any sense.

181
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,400
Here's the deal.

182
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,800
The government keeps raising rates because it's the only tool they have to keep inflation

183
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,120
under control, and it's not working.

184
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,600
You can't spend your way out of inflation.

185
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,440
You've seen the impact on the stock market,

186
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,920
and you've seen the impact on your savings.

187
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,640
Hedge inflation by owning gold, whether physical gold and silver in your safe

188
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,120
or through an IRA in precious metals,

189
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,280
where you can hold real gold and silver in a tax-sheltered retirement account.

190
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,160
Buy gold and get a free safe to store it in.

191
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,360
That's right, on qualifying purchases from Birch Gold Group,

192
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,840
now through March 31st, they'll ship a free safe directly to your door.

193
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,640
Just text Jordan to 989898 to get your free info kit on gold

194
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,600
and to claim eligibility for your free safe.

195
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,080
Then talk to one of their precious metals specialists.

196
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,520
That's Jordan to 989898 today.

197
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:03,040
What's fascinating about Hungary was what I wanted to do was look at something much deeper

198
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,960
than the typical birth rate numbers that we see today.

199
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,160
I'm trying to change that.

200
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,720
If you look deeper, you can find data that if you merge together,

201
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,200
which I don't believe anyone had ever done before,

202
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,720
that gives you two measures.

203
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,960
One is of societal childlessness, and the other is family structure.

204
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,280
So the traditional way to measure childlessness is to wait to women,

205
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,240
or 45 usually, and have some surveys, maybe a census.

206
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,560
So you're waiting to the end of the fertility window and counting them then.

207
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,120
What I wanted to see was what is the societal challenges today

208
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,400
if there's reduction in the number of women starting to have families

209
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,760
compared to what you would expect.

210
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,840
We should be able to track that now.

211
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,360
So looking at Hungary, which I've just been doing recently,

212
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,080
was fascinating.

213
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,520
I mean, they're giving huge incentives for people to have three and four children.

214
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,760
But the family structure in Hungary is not changing at all.

215
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,960
At all.

216
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,840
What is changing, which may or may not be linked, it's associative in some way,

217
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,240
but cause what we don't know, is the childlessness rate,

218
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,320
and Hungary does seem to be going down.

219
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,160
More people look like they're starting to have families.

220
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,560
And what happens then is when people start to have families,

221
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,440
they go on because family structure is locked in globally.

222
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,320
That's another finding.

223
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,800
And so what do you mean?

224
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,920
So we'll go in two directions.

225
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,720
What do you mean?

226
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,800
What are you speaking about when you're talking,

227
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,280
when you're expressing your concerns about family structure?

228
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,360
Well, family structure, basically, is the percentage of women.

229
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,760
We say women because we've got so much data on women,

230
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,680
but really we should think of men and women.

231
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,120
The proportion of women couples who have one child,

232
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,080
or two, or three, or four, or five, or more.

233
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,240
And if you take data for Japan, and you look at 1973,

234
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,200
right before the fall in birth rates,

235
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,120
the percentages of women having one, two, three, four

236
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,440
are identical today, as they were then.

237
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,120
6% of women in 1973 were having four more children.

238
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,600
Today, it's the exact same number, 6%.

239
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,760
So our focus has been completely,

240
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,080
if we've been in a fog looking at overall birth rates,

241
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,000
what you find is in Japan in 1974, interesting year,

242
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,960
an explosion in childlessness, which went from 3% to 6%

243
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,680
to 15% to 21% to 30% plus percent in a space of about four years.

244
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,560
The same in Italy, the same in Germany.

245
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,280
In four years.

246
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,280
In four years, it's a shock.

247
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,040
It was what I call a baby shock.

248
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,080
And then if you look at Korea, South Korea,

249
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,320
which you mentioned earlier, if we take South Korea,

250
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,080
mid-90s, right in the midst of a currency shock,

251
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,480
you see, childless rates were already maybe 15% there.

252
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,040
Suddenly, it goes up to, I believe, 30%.

253
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,240
And now it's over 40%.

254
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,760
And this is childless at what age?

255
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,400
Well, when I estimate childlessness,

256
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,040
I'm taking, for the given population of women,

257
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,440
the number of births you'd expect to have at any age

258
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
and saying, how many first-time mothers were there?

259
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,960
And when you count up the number of first-time mothers

260
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,040
of any age group and look at the overall population structure,

261
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,400
you can see, well, wait a minute,

262
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,080
there's a gap opening up here compared to the number you would expect.

263
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,960
So this is like age agnostic, in a sense.

264
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,240
And as a measure, people would say,

265
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,160
well, some of those women might, there might be a boom in the future.

266
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,560
People might be just delaying, but that doesn't happen.

267
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,880
There's no example of those booms ever happening.

268
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,600
So it seems to be we've got this cycle going on

269
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,560
that people are pulled quite quickly into this,

270
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,640
what I call, world of unplanned childlessness, if I can.

271
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,560
I've had to coin quite a few phrases here.

272
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,680
And I should explain what it might mean by unplanned childlessness.

273
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:13,200
If you look at surveys, look at research,

274
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,720
the vast majority of people want children.

275
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:17,920
It's innate.

276
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,120
And some don't.

277
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,240
That's clear.

278
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,800
What percentage do approximately?

279
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,040
I'm estimating around 5% don't.

280
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,280
There have been Gallup polls in the U.S. done.

281
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,960
Is that different between men and women?

282
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,120
I don't have that data.

283
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,520
Okay.

284
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,560
So 5% you figure are out of the game?

285
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:36,800
Yes.

286
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,160
By voluntary choice.

287
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,720
Yes.

288
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:38,960
Right.

289
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,840
And what percentage are childless?

290
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,400
Well, right now we're looking at 30% to 40%

291
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,440
the most developed nations.

292
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,600
So the vast majority, 80%, it's estimated in studies.

293
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,120
And I think this...

294
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,160
So that's that involuntary childlessness.

295
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,080
And I've been thinking about that lately.

296
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:01,120
We have this notion for men of involuntary celibacy in cells.

297
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,400
We don't have a term that's at hand for involuntary childlessness

298
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,440
among women.

299
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,200
And it hasn't been recognized as a...

300
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,200
Like what would you call it?

301
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,480
A universal social problem.

302
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,600
But you just said 5% of women don't want children

303
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,080
but 30% don't have them.

304
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,040
And so there's a huge gap there between desire and reality.

305
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,600
So I think frankly, I believe it's the biggest

306
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,920
societal problem that we have.

307
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,200
And it's hiding because we haven't recognized it.

308
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,160
And if you find people, as I did making the documentary,

309
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,840
people who are struggling, 30s, late 30s, women particularly,

310
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,920
but men too, who've given up in their 40s

311
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,240
and they're opening their heart to you

312
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,000
with a level of what they call grief.

313
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,600
And in English language, grief is used for one particular context.

314
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,280
It's not necessarily used normally for something you never had.

315
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,000
I think in other languages, there are terms that encompass that.

316
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,200
But it's the same emotion.

317
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,320
And I've been pulled into conversations where

318
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:14,800
I have frankly been brought myself to the depths of understanding the suffering

319
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,400
from these people who thought they were going through life,

320
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,400
getting the education, starting the career path, probably.

321
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,920
Thinking that, well, you know what, I'm not 30 yet.

322
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,000
I've got time to meet a partner.

323
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,120
And then getting to the point of often, there is no partner.

324
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,520
Or that biology gets in the way.

325
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,160
Yeah, well, it turns out that life is shorter than people think.

326
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,000
I've had clinical clients who followed that path.

327
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,360
And some of them were women who had initially decided

328
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,120
that they didn't want to have children

329
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,400
and then changed their minds quite dramatically in their late 20s,

330
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,000
which is a very common pattern, and then couldn't have children.

331
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,320
And it was just absolutely disastrous for them.

332
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,880
They were often on the artificial fertility route for 10 years

333
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,520
with multiple miscarriages and failures on that front.

334
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,280
And it's a bloody dismal outcome.

335
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:41,840
I think if you caught me at the right day in my 20s,

336
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,920
when I was very in love or excited about a partner,

337
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,040
I would say yes.

338
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,920
But if you were to pry into that, I might say,

339
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,720
I don't know, that seems crazy to have a kid in my 20s.

340
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,520
Okay, so you're making a case here.

341
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,280
You're making a psychological case in some sense at the moment

342
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,120
in that this is a phenomenon worth attending to,

343
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,360
because the vast majority of people who end up childless,

344
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,720
which is a more serious immediate problem for women

345
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,000
because of the biological restrictions on their reproductive capacity.

346
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,040
The reason that's a problem is because so many women

347
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,720
end up in that situation despite wanting children.

348
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,480
So that's a real psychological problem.

349
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,280
But you could take a sociological stance and say,

350
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,120
well, as has been insisted upon for 60 years,

351
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,640
there's too many people on the planet,

352
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,560
and it's just not a bad thing at all

353
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,480
if we stop reproducing in this manner.

354
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,920
And if the price we have to pay for reduction

355
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,560
in the number of excess mouths to feed

356
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,800
is that there are some unhappy women, so be it.

357
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,720
What do you think about this

358
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,280
at a sociological or political or economic level?

359
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,800
Well, first of all, I think that's a terribly sad thing

360
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,920
to contemplate that we have to somehow enforce

361
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,840
perhaps lifelong grief and sadness on a subset of society

362
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,360
who were mostly unlucky enough not to have the children

363
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,400
they wanted to have for the sake of the planet when there are...

364
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,840
Hypothetical, say.

365
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,440
Hypothetical planet at some future time.

366
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,560
At some future time.

367
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,800
And to me, the first thing, my reaction,

368
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,680
strong reaction, isn't there another way, if that's right?

369
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,480
And then you look at data as a reported nature last year

370
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,520
on the overall footprint by age group.

371
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,880
Quite a number of scientists put their name to it,

372
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,200
and it states very clearly that 8% of our footprint

373
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,560
occurs when we're aged under 30.

374
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,360
Then it rises quite significantly between 30 and around 65,

375
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,120
I believe, and then it falls off sharply.

376
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,840
Well, that means that if the world's births were to...

377
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,600
Magically, well, it wouldn't be magic,

378
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,720
dropped by, say, half.

379
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,400
I love taking extreme situations.

380
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,560
So let's imagine that from tomorrow,

381
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,440
only half of the births happen for some crazy reason,

382
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,400
that 8% of total emissions or footprint would go down to 4%

383
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,000
in 30 years' time.

384
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,880
This is going to have almost no impact for decades.

385
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,480
At a time when I think we have to find other solutions

386
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,760
as much as they're needed to solve problems that are out there.

387
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,320
So the idea that we're going to inflict this pain,

388
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,920
deep personal suffering pain in people,

389
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,840
and perhaps be pleased about it, as I know some people are,

390
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,680
I think it's terribly said.

391
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,320
I think it might be that, to come back,

392
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,320
I would like to clarify that for those people

393
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,040
who don't have the desire, I consider myself a pan-natalist.

394
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,280
If you don't want to have children,

395
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,440
I will be your biggest supporter to say that's fine.

396
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,960
And I think there might be a misunderstanding in society

397
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,840
for some people who perhaps don't share that desire,

398
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,080
who perhaps can't quite understand how fundamental this desire is.

399
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,400
Yeah, well, most people who are in that boat

400
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,760
are being willfully blind in my experience.

401
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,960
And so the idea that there are reasons to not want to have children,

402
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,360
one reason is an overwhelming self-centered narcissism.

403
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,800
That's not the only reason, but it's definitely one reason.

404
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,040
And people talk about, you know,

405
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,040
the interference with their personal freedom

406
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,720
and their desire to pursue their career.

407
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,080
And in that, I read something like the absolute inability

408
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,720
to ever sacrifice your own narrow self-interest.

409
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,200
And I do mean narrow to the, what would you say,

410
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,040
concerns and needs of other people.

411
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,560
So, you know, it's interesting to me that it's 5%

412
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,880
that don't want children,

413
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,800
and that the rate of that kind of self-centered narcissism

414
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,400
is about 4-5% too.

415
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,040
Now, I am not saying that everyone who decides

416
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,520
not to have children falls into that category,

417
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,080
but I am saying that a fair number of people

418
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,720
who don't want children fall into that category.

419
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,600
I mean, if you think about it biologically,

420
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,320
every single one of your maternal ancestors

421
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,440
for 3.5 billion years reproduced successfully.

422
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,080
And it might be that you're the exception to that rule.

423
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,520
But, you know, if you are,

424
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,600
you should think long and hard about why.

425
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,800
You also might want to think long and hard about why,

426
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,080
given that it's likely to have a pretty damn detrimental effect

427
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,200
on your life.

428
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,080
You know, it's all fine to be fancy free and footloose

429
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,600
when you're 30 and 35,

430
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,920
but it's a lot less amusing when you're 50,

431
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,640
and it might be downright dreadful by the time you're,

432
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,840
let's say 65.

433
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,320
So, all right.

434
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,760
So, on the population front now,

435
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,480
we talked a little bit about the psychological catastrophe

436
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,160
of involuntary childlessness.

437
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,200
I'm curious too about the social and economic consequences.

438
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,600
So, as you get a demographic bulge,

439
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,400
more and more older people and fewer and fewer younger people,

440
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,640
obviously, you have fewer people to take care of the older people,

441
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,200
but I also have never really read anything pertaining to models

442
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,560
of like real estate value collapse,

443
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,640
because it doesn't take very long if there are more houses

444
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,200
than there are people for the value of real estate to fall to,

445
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,400
well, to what?

446
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,440
To nothing?

447
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,440
I mean, that's what happened in Detroit.

448
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,360
It basically fell to nothing.

449
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,360
I mean, Detroit has recovered to some degree,

450
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,320
but we don't know at all what the world would look like

451
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,000
if real estate values fell to virtually nothing,

452
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,640
especially because that's where most people put their retirement value.

453
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,760
So, what do you see, what do you foresee happening

454
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,480
on the political and economic front,

455
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,720
given the shift towards the elderly demographically?

456
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,040
We're going to see it in China first, right, clearly.

457
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,720
Clearly.

458
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,480
Well, Japan too.

459
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,560
One of the reasons I moved to live in Japan

460
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,400
is to be close to...

461
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,840
I wanted to feel this product.

462
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,240
I wanted to be able to see it and almost touch it,

463
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,520
and you can there.

464
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,040
But you mentioned Detroit.

465
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,400
I spent many, many years living in the suburbs of Detroit,

466
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,320
and right around the time I was looking to start this project,

467
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,720
I was able to drive around the streets of Detroit

468
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,360
and see street after street after street of tens and tens of thousands

469
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,920
of decaying houses.

470
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,080
I remember one day driving along and there was a house,

471
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,120
and these were nice houses back in the day, still spacious,

472
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,360
and there was a young family having a picnic outside one of these houses.

473
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,400
And it was the perfect setting, you might say,

474
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,400
and every context except every other house in the street

475
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,160
looked like they were completely vacant, dilapidated.

476
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,840
And around that time, listening to local Detroit news every night,

477
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,960
it was crime.

478
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,280
It was street lights that weren't functioning.

479
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,400
It was lack of safety.

480
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,560
It was lack of functioning of basic utilities.

481
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,680
It was infrastructure and bridges that the city couldn't afford.

482
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,080
And of course, in 2013, it went bankrupt.

483
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,600
So I had this backdrop to knowing what was happening

484
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,840
to Detroit as a city,

485
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,200
and you're running by property value.

486
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,680
Around that time, you could buy a significant property in Detroit

487
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,960
for $10,000.

488
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,640
You probably couldn't go there to ever see it,

489
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,160
because it wasn't safe at that time.

490
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,880
Right, right, right.

491
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,400
And you were right, Detroit has come back.

492
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,520
So in some ways, it is a challenge.

493
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,920
Well, they demolished huge tracts of houses.

494
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,600
But how do you do that when half the houses are still occupied?

495
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,680
You go through this period of time,

496
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,520
unless you're going to say to people,

497
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,680
everybody move three streets over now,

498
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,200
and you do that every few years,

499
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,960
you can't easily go into neighborhoods

500
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,680
and start moving things back to nature,

501
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,880
which is what Detroit's doing.

502
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,440
You can individual houses,

503
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,360
but you still have these scars

504
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,360
of the empty spaces that were there.

505
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,760
And I show some of this in the documentary.

506
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,080
So the idea, I mean, people,

507
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,240
I was on a podcast with Williamson recently,

508
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,920
and it was the first time I got a sense

509
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,280
of the comments that people make.

510
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,120
And many people were sharing these deep personal stories

511
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,280
about their life to do with unplanned chalices.

512
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,120
Yeah.

513
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,360
Others were sharing concerns about

514
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,120
whether they ever become grandparents.

515
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,960
And so, but a lot of people were saying,

516
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,640
well, this is just about economics.

517
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,360
You know, who cares?

518
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,280
This is just about big corporations suffering.

519
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:39,840
Who cares?

520
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,920
I think people need to understand

521
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,640
this is going to impact everybody, everybody's life.

522
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,280
If you're living in an area where there's literally

523
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,680
decay, dilapidation all around you

524
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,920
and the taxes that you're paying to your city

525
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,080
or your municipality aren't covering

526
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,440
the basic infrastructure,

527
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,680
no one's going to escape from this.

528
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,120
And I think people don't understand that.

529
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,160
So in my case, understanding life in Detroit,

530
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,800
I think, I really love the city and it's great.

531
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,920
You know, I love the people.

532
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,280
I love the way it is starting to come back.

533
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,400
But that experience, I think, really spoke to me

534
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,280
that we really need to think about what this means.

535
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,880
And you talk about the socioeconomic.

536
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,440
I mean, the economics, you know, go beyond the city

537
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,320
and the property values.

538
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,400
It's the pension funds.

539
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,000
It's the social welfare funds that, you know, people think,

540
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,160
I think I did too at the time that, you know, the retirement,

541
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:38,080
the cost to maintain each of us in a retirement

542
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,880
is basically what the government or someone's been saving

543
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,080
for when we get to that age.

544
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,640
Yeah, right.

545
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,880
It's not what we're paying right now.

546
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,160
That's a bargain with the future.

547
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,280
That's a bargain.

548
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,520
You're covering the people who are retired now.

549
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,760
What the government has put away for us is debt.

550
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:52,720
Debt.

551
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,040
Yeah, yeah.

552
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,080
There's no savings.

553
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,240
And then there's a promise.

554
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:56,800
Right.

555
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,560
And then the debt's a problem because...

556
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,680
Yes, that's for sure.

557
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,000
If you have a shrinking number of taxpayers,

558
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,520
the debt's not shrinking.

559
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,320
So the repayment on the debt actually becomes worse and worse and worse.

560
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:08,560
Yeah.

561
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,680
Well, and hypothetically, you can remediate that with immigration,

562
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,320
but then that opens up another can of worms,

563
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:20,320
which is no one really knows what the maximal rate of incorporation

564
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,320
a society can manage without imploding, right?

565
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,760
I mean, obviously, Canada, the US, the US in particular,

566
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,960
is an immigrant society,

567
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,000
and that's worked out extremely well for the immigrants

568
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,600
and for the society.

569
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,680
But the idea that there's no upper limit to our capacity

570
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:42,080
to digest and integrate, let's say, is absolutely preposterous.

571
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,520
So, and we don't know, but the notion that we can replenish at the rate

572
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,120
that we're losing on the birth rate front strikes me as,

573
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,800
it's at least a debatable claim.

574
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,800
We'll be right back.

575
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,560
First, we wanted to give you a sneak peek at Jordan's new series, Exodus.

576
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,280
The Hebrews created history as we know it.

577
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,600
You don't get away with anything,

578
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,160
and so you might think you can bend the fabric of reality

579
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,000
and that you can treat people instrumentally

580
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,680
and that you can bow to the tyrant and violate your conscience without cost.

581
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,040
You will pay the piper.

582
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,240
It's going to call you out of that slavery into freedom,

583
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,240
even if that pulls you into the desert.

584
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,800
And we're going to see that there's something else going on here

585
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,800
that is far more cosmic and deeper than what you can imagine.

586
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,920
The highest ethical spirit to which we're beholden

587
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:46,560
is presented precisely as that spirit that allies itself

588
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,520
with the cause of freedom against tyranny.

589
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,320
Yes, exactly. I want villains to get punished.

590
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,920
But do you want the villains to learn

591
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,760
before they have to pay the ultimate price?

592
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,360
That's such a Christian question.

593
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:16,880
Immigration is a subject that I think we actually only look at one side of it,

594
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,920
and I certainly did, until I went to Nepal.

595
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:24,640
And I sat down with the professor of the head of the department of population,

596
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,080
Professor Patak, in one of the largest universities in Asia.

597
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,080
And I wanted to talk about falling birth rates in Nepal,

598
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,240
which were just about replacement level at that time.

599
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:41,200
And all he seemed to want to talk about was the pains of migration on Nepal,

600
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,920
the people, the communities that are left behind.

601
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,200
I never for one second had thought about this dark side of immigration.

602
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,920
Oh, your brain drain, for example.

603
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,840
Community drain. You're actually taking away,

604
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,840
you're leaving the old parents there,

605
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,080
and you're sending remittances back.

606
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,280
And that seems positive.

607
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,480
But those parents aren't really looking for remittances,

608
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:08,000
they're looking for people, community, their children to be there into their older age.

609
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,680
And we went to film some of these older people,

610
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,960
and the looks on their forelorn looks in their face.

611
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,560
No one thinks about that.

612
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,400
And then you have another situation,

613
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,840
which is often it's men who are the immigrants, at least first.

614
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:29,440
And, well, okay, so maybe that seems to sound a good way for it to start.

615
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:36,160
But there's another dark side to that, is the women behind are either not married yet,

616
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,440
or they are married, and there are men have gone off elsewhere,

617
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,200
and they're not having children.

618
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,280
Or their husband's coming back for three weeks a year,

619
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,800
and you've got three weeks a year to try and get pregnant.

620
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,880
And of course, most are not.

621
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:56,400
So you actually are propelling countries into low birth rates,

622
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,160
the same factor that the rest of us are going through right now.

623
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,400
So the immigration debate, and I'm an immigrant myself,

624
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,400
you know, I've been an immigrant to the US, to Japan now.

625
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,880
So I'm not sleeping all against immigration at all, as you say,

626
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:16,560
it's done great service to US, Canada, and many other countries too.

627
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,520
But the idea that-

628
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,880
But yeah, but that doesn't mean it's a solution to the violation of the play and replacement.

629
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,240
Right, right, right.

630
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,280
Now you talked about Japan, let's talk about Japan a little bit.

631
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,640
How long did you live in Japan?

632
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,880
I still do, so I've been there for five years.

633
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:36,160
And you said you can, well, so what do you experience there in relationship

634
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,480
to your concerns about population decline?

635
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:44,000
Let me tell you about a community in rural Tokyo.

636
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,280
So this is the world's biggest city based on some measures.

637
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:52,240
You go to the northwestern part of Tokyo,

638
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,840
and there's an area called Takashi Medaera that's featured in the documentary.

639
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:02,080
1973, the 10,000 homes in this apartment were filled with young families.

640
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,480
And there's all footies where you see, you know, just children everywhere.

641
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,040
I went back with someone who was a child in those days,

642
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,520
and, you know, you can hear the voices of the past.

643
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:19,360
And today, it's a ghost town, but it's not unoccupied.

644
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,200
Ninety-eight percent of the apartments are still occupied,

645
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,360
but they're old people, and they're mostly old women living alone.

646
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,520
Yes, and they're old women because men die early.

647
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,160
Men die early.

648
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,240
Right, so this is another, that's exactly right.

649
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,120
So one of the things that you see as young people disappear,

650
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:43,600
and as the population ages, is that the landscape is made up of isolated old women

651
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,520
who no one cares about, right?

652
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,600
A dismal destiny for all concerned.

653
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,720
You know, I'd love people, frankly, to watch the documentary to really sense this,

654
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:03,920
because, you know, there's one scene there, and it is harrowing, but to put it in simple terms,

655
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,920
there's an 80-year-old woman who has no family, who's contemplating suicide,

656
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,120
because she's nothing to live for, no one to live for, and no one to communicate.

657
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,400
Oh, she should move to Canada.

658
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,800
We have a nice medically assisted death program here that's, I think,

659
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,680
accounting for something like three to five percent of all deaths now.

660
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,600
So, you know, there's a solution for everyone to contemplate.

661
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,160
In fact, there was a Japanese professor who came out the other day,

662
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,040
a week ago, suggesting that it would be morally appropriate for the older people

663
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:42,400
in Japan to consider suicide as a root out, because they're a burden to society.

664
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,200
And now he's backtracking, saying he didn't really mean that, but it's dangerous

665
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,480
once you start to put that out there, because there are people.

666
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:57,920
You know, I remember a conversation with a young woman in Japan, and talking about her future,

667
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,880
and I did that with a lot of people, over 230 people I interviewed in 24 countries,

668
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:08,160
and she mentioned that her grandmother was living with her family,

669
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,320
but she mentioned the burden of her grandmother to the family.

670
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:18,160
And she came out with a point that I guess many might be thinking when you're that age,

671
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,280
why is she still here?

672
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:27,600
And when you hear that, you know, and then you meet people who are that age,

673
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,600
who I think are still so much to give to society, they're just excluded from it.

674
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,480
They're not.

675
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,800
Well, it's hard if they're not integrated in...

676
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,440
Well, sometimes it's hard if they are integrated into a family,

677
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,200
but it's definitely harder if they're not.

678
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,960
It's also the case that a lot of people who contemplate suicide

679
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,680
do that not so much because they're specifically suffering,

680
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,840
although that can certainly be a contributing factor,

681
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:55,520
but because they do believe that they are fundamentally best construed as a burden,

682
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,760
and that the world, including the people around them, would be better off if they disappeared.

683
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:08,000
So that's a very sad, what would you say, realm to inhabit in your misery and isolation.

684
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,320
So can we walk through the structure of the documentary?

685
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:12,880
Yes, of course.

686
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,040
Yeah, so it's just so everyone listening is reminded it's called

687
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,040
the name of the documentary is Birth Gap.

688
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,680
And so let's walk through the structure of it.

689
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,280
The first of all, the title, Birth Gap.

690
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,920
I'm going to just explain why it's called Birth Gap.

691
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,960
What is a birth gap?

692
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,040
To me, it's what I defined as the gap between the number of old people

693
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,120
to support in society and births.

694
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:41,520
So it's an indication of, frankly, a measure that we're not taking account of today.

695
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,720
What is that ratio?

696
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:53,680
So to me, to be very honest with you, whether we hit 9 billion or maybe 10, it's trivial.

697
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,480
It's going to happen.

698
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,800
It's going to be in that ballpark.

699
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,040
Whether we like it or not, that's going to happen.

700
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,920
And what actually matters is the age structure.

701
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,800
So Birth Gap, the title of the movie, that's where it comes from.

702
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:14,640
Before I went on this journey, chapter one is me literally going with an iPad,

703
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,840
showing people data.

704
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,720
We started in Italy, we were Switzerland, we went to Japan and just started

705
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,560
talk to people about what's happening in their own societies.

706
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,920
So how did you move into the realm of documentary filmmaking?

707
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,560
Well, I have to thank my second son, Adam, for that.

708
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,240
Because my idea at this point, I mean, I'm not a filmmaker.

709
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,080
Certainly wasn't then.

710
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,560
My thought was, this is a big problem.

711
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,920
I can write a book about this.

712
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,520
I thought just about I have the ability to write, to explain this.

713
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,880
And what I wanted to do, because there's other books out there,

714
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,560
was come up with a new way to help visualize this problem

715
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,440
and to use the book to kind of communicate.

716
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,640
And I felt, well, maps, no one's really come up with the structure of a map.

717
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:09,120
And in doing this, I was explained to my son, Adam, and he said, Dad, no one, our age,

718
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,320
his age, reads books anymore, we all watch documentaries.

719
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,440
Right, right.

720
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,560
Or listen to them.

721
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,520
Or listen to them.

722
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,240
Yeah.

723
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,400
And for me, well, that's not me.

724
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,320
There's no way I could possibly do that.

725
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:25,840
And then by chance, a friend of a friend was a former videographer news anchor

726
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:32,000
for a Washington DC news network, but was going out on her own.

727
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,320
And long story short, we thought, well, OK, let's see if we can make this work.

728
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,560
And I brought her along for two weeks to film the first interviews,

729
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,160
thinking if nothing else, this is going to be an archive for my own research.

730
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,880
Right, right, right.

731
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,520
Save me note-taking while I'm listening to all of these people.

732
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:56,240
And as we got into it, the personal stories opened up of people who you could see them

733
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,840
contemplating the future of their lives like one springs to mind a young elementary school

734
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,200
teacher in Switzerland, 30 years old, a young man.

735
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:11,520
And when we walked through with him the future of elementary schools in Switzerland,

736
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:17,040
you could see the process in his mind, realizing we're not going to need anywhere

737
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,760
near the number of elementary school teachers that we have now and what that might mean for him.

738
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,480
So the documentary starts literally with me asking people in countries, why is this happening?

739
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:39,200
And frankly, I was hoping, in this entire project, I was expecting at some point to

740
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,960
sit down and do some form of regressive model to find a correlation between something that would link

741
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:52,960
these small dragons, these falling birth rates in Japan, Germany, and Italy,

742
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,360
because they were happening at the same time and they were spreading.

743
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,560
I never got to that point and I'm very grateful.

744
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:03,840
I didn't because I probably would have found something like ice cream sales happened at the

745
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,560
same time and now some curious thing would have come up.

746
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,480
It's very hard to identify.

747
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:15,280
Well, it seems obvious that one of the causes, the distal causes, I would say,

748
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,600
clearly is the promotion of the birth control pill.

749
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:27,360
But even that is a somewhat shallow answer because there's a very specific set of social

750
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:35,280
and economic realities, zeitgeist, that even made the invention and distribution and acceptance

751
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,440
of the birth control possible.

752
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,760
You had to have the psychological stage set for the acceptance of that technology,

753
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,040
the demand for that technology before it could be developed or implemented.

754
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,840
You started the documentary.

755
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,800
You're in chapter one.

756
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,960
You're starting to ask people what's going on.

757
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,000
What are they telling you?

758
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,480
Yeah, well, no one had a clear answer and maybe that was overly simplistic.

759
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,240
But what I was trying to do is find some common thread.

760
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:12,000
But let me just, if I can, talk about contraceptives because there's a wonderful kind of example.

761
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:22,080
The contraceptive pill was not legalized in Japan until 1990 and it was only legalized

762
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,560
because Viagra was legalized.

763
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,880
And at that point, women said, wait, you've been blocking the contraceptive pill and now

764
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,560
you're allowing Viagra at that point.

765
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,640
So you had the precipitous decline in birth rate from 1973.

766
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,760
You had an increase in mass abortions.

767
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,520
So this was a societal issue with that.

768
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,000
So okay, so that shows that it's something deeper than this.

769
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,520
It's something deeper.

770
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:51,200
And also, if you look at other countries, particularly UK at the time, France to US,

771
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,440
where you also had access to the contraceptive pill, you were not seeing falling birth rates.

772
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,120
And a lot of people would say, well, it's obvious it was industrialization.

773
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:05,360
It was something to do with urbanization.

774
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,120
But the correlations aren't there.

775
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,040
If you look at, well, why did this only happen in those three countries?

776
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,880
And the answer comes back to, I'd love people to see unfold in the documentary,

777
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:22,480
but it's a sudden increase in this unplanned involuntary childlessness happened in Germany,

778
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,320
Italy, those countries at the same time.

779
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:29,280
Well, it's definitely the case that as women become more educated, they have fewer children.

780
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:37,840
And that's now the precise causal pathway there isn't obvious.

781
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:45,360
One simple suggestion would be that it is a matter of accidental delay.

782
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,520
I mean, I've seen this in my daughter, you know, my daughter, although she had terrible

783
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,680
health problems and that complicated her life a lot.

784
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:58,240
She had initially thought that she might want to go be a physician, but that's like 12 years.

785
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,080
And she was also very oriented towards having children.

786
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,880
And she's managed to have one child despite her health problems.

787
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:14,080
But that desire to pursue an intense educational pathway does exist in conflict,

788
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:18,240
certainly with an early start to family development.

789
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,480
If you presume that that doesn't matter because you've got time,

790
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,320
you're not going to find out that isn't true for 10 years in your own life.

791
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,520
And maybe the culture won't find out that's true for like 30 years.

792
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,120
You know, I mean, we still tell young women who are 19.

793
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,200
I made a comment on that was clipped on an Instagram reel by someone

794
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
about the fact that we always lie to young women about what's going to be important in their lives.

795
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,160
We tell them it's going to be all career.

796
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:50,800
Said, you know, I've worked in female dominated industries my whole life.

797
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:57,520
And what I've observed is among men and women alike that it's a very rare person for whom

798
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,160
career is the most important thing in their life.

799
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,920
Even if they're men, although it's true for more men,

800
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,440
it's true for virtually no women by the time they hit 30.

801
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,680
And the amount of vitriol that comment generated was unparalleled.

802
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,000
And that's something because I've had plenty of vitriol generated from things I said,

803
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,360
but that was and it was all young women, you know, talking about how some old white guy like me

804
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:26,080
had no right to tell young women what to do with their bodies, which I most certainly was not.

805
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:32,400
But but it is, you can see a simple pathway there, right?

806
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,600
It's like, well, we have this avenue where we can pursue our career and our education

807
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:42,400
and everything else we want. And then we'll be able to solve the problem of having a family.

808
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:48,800
The problem with that is, well, it's hard enough to find a mate when you're 23, 24.

809
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,880
By the time you're 30, it's even more difficult.

810
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,880
And by the time you're 35, it's starting to become well now impossible to find a mate

811
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,880
and get pregnant and have a family, especially if you're going to have more than one kid.

812
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:04,480
And so well, so there's a there's a direct conflict there between

813
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:13,440
the avenues that are open to women and the need to to strike while the iron's hot on the reproductive front.

814
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,440
Nobody really knows how to reconcile that.

815
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,440
I mean, it's odd because women will live about seven years longer than men.

816
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:25,440
So it could be the case that the societal norm could be that women have their children

817
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,440
when they're quite young and then go back to school in their 30s, that would actually work out.

818
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,440
In principle, that could work out quite nicely, but we don't have the norms in place

819
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,200
to make that a possibility.

820
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,440
But we have to start addressing exactly this.

821
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:45,920
Because if we don't, you know, to me, I mean, there's so many ideas today about reproductive technology

822
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,600
that are overstated.

823
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,440
Oh, yes, terribly.

824
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,240
Freeze your eggs.

825
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:55,520
And yeah, it's 40, you know, if you have a partner and if you still have energy that you might then.

826
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:55,840
Yes.

827
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,040
And everything goes well.

828
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,280
Yeah.

829
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,640
If everything goes well, you have the money.

830
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:58,880
Yeah.

831
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,960
And you and the emotional stamina, all of that.

832
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:08,240
So part of what I am hoping to do through the documentary and my work after this

833
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:13,040
is to just increase awareness, particularly to women, but you need a man as well.

834
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:20,720
So it's both that the fertility window is much shorter and the ability of children gets harder

835
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,440
and harder and harder.

836
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,040
It's not just about getting pregnant.

837
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,040
It's about being able to deliver, you know, being able to see the pregnancy through to,

838
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,560
which gets exponentially harder very, very quickly.

839
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,280
I should mention, I interviewed five fertility doctors for the documentary itself.

840
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:42,240
And, you know, each one of them wanted to open up about the challenges because normally

841
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,840
they have to sell their services.

842
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:49,200
Normally I have to tell people, think positively, here's what we've done for other people.

843
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,040
Here's what we can do for you.

844
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:56,000
What they were telling to me openly, I'm frankly getting quite emotional about it on a couple

845
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,040
of applications, was it's terrible because so often it doesn't work out.

846
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:07,520
Well, one in three couples by the age of 30 have pronounced fertility problems defined as

847
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:13,600
inability to conceive within a year of embarking on the endeavor consciously, right?

848
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,720
So that's one in three.

849
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:19,280
And of course it just gets worse and worse as age creeps up.

850
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,800
And 30 is not that old.

851
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,040
And it does mean that women have a damn tight window.

852
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,560
It's 13 years, let's say, by the time you're 17, by some standards you're mature enough to

853
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:36,480
consider reproduction, 17 or 18, on the extreme end.

854
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:42,000
And then, well, 35 is the other end of that distribution.

855
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:48,080
And you're playing with fire by the time you're delaying, especially if you don't have a partner,

856
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:51,760
by the time you're delaying till 35, especially if you want three children.

857
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,120
Yeah, right.

858
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,080
I'm thinking just one.

859
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,160
And it's also the case, I think if you're a reasonable observer of human nature,

860
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:05,520
you see that people have three sources of fundamental gratification in their lives.

861
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:11,120
One is the pursuit of their own interests, including career and job.

862
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,760
One is their intimate relationship.

863
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,960
And the other is their family.

864
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:20,320
And obviously the intimate relationship and the family are very integrally associated.

865
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:27,840
And if you miss out on one of those, you may be able to fill it by exceptional ability

866
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,000
in the remaining domains.

867
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,800
But for most people, not only is that highly unlikely, it's also highly undesirable.

868
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:43,920
Because to take the point as well, here in my eye, an older male talking about things

869
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:49,200
that are very sensitive to women, but there are a lot of women out there saying the exact same

870
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,840
thing. And there was one this morning, I got an email from Melanie Knokin,

871
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:58,080
who's written a book called Otherhood, who herself has no children.

872
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:03,600
And she put it succinctly that in her words, women are going through the education path,

873
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:07,360
the career path, to try to ultimately fall in love and have a family.

874
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,240
Yeah, right.

875
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,360
It's all linked.

876
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,800
Yeah, well, I think it's the same for men.

877
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,080
I think so too.

878
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:16,480
Well, half the reason, half, it's more than that, half the reason that

879
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,240
men strive for career success is to impress women and attract them.

880
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,440
In fact, it's higher than that.

881
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:27,120
But maybe that point is the heart of the problem we have today, because today,

882
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:31,360
if you look at who's at college and who's actually earning more right now,

883
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:35,440
I read this morning, women in cities in the U.S. are earning more than men.

884
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,080
I don't know if that's right or wrong, but you have this situation.

885
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,520
Yeah, it's right under 30.

886
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,080
Yeah.

887
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:44,800
So in U.S. colleges right now, I believe it's 9.5 million women.

888
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,280
And Iran, 6.57 million men.

889
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,760
Oh, and the women start dropping out of college, by the way, when they start

890
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,000
to outnumber the men two to one, right?

891
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,200
Because a lot of the reason people go to college, you gotta ask yourself,

892
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,400
what's college for?

893
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,600
It's like, well, it's to get educated, to go to lectures, to be accredited.

894
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,520
It's like, no, probably not.

895
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,040
Probably the reason people go to college is to find a bait.

896
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,880
And there's a selected pool there, and you have a decent chance of finding

897
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:17,680
someone of approximately your ability and forward-looking vision, let's say.

898
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:23,200
And the reason people are willing to shell out between $150,000 and $250,000 for four years

899
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,080
is in no small part, so that they can find a mate.

900
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:31,280
Well, and if you demolish that by, well, radically decreasing the number of available men,

901
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,760
for example, you're just going to blow the whole enterprise out of the water,

902
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,120
which is already what's happening.

903
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,440
And absolutely.

904
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:43,280
And this is perhaps my greatest concern, because I think if we make young people

905
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:48,560
more aware of fertility, the fertility window, they might want to have children earlier.

906
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,680
If we link that to in some way enabling careers later in life,

907
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:57,760
which has to fundamentally happen for this to work, we might still be left with a situation

908
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:04,320
where women, the term is hypergenic, where women want to marry someone at least as educated,

909
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,280
at least as successful, taller than they are.

910
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,520
But if we're in a situation where there's so few men getting the same level of education,

911
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,600
we might be left with this imbalance.

912
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,160
Oh, yeah, that's already happening, clearly.

913
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,480
It's very difficult for women to overcome the hypergamous instinct,

914
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,640
because they're trying to redress the imbalance in terms of reproductive responsibility.

915
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,000
There's no evidence at all.

916
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,600
You get a little bit of flattening of hypergamy in extremely egalitarian societies like Scandinavia,

917
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,440
but it certainly doesn't disappear.

918
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,160
And so that's built in at a very fundamental biological level.

919
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,160
And I don't think any casual tinkering on the anthropological or sociological front

920
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,200
is going to shift that a bit.

921
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,600
So that's a big problem.

922
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,320
It's a big problem.

923
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:54,320
It's also the case too that if marriages where the wife out earns or out statuses the husband

924
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:57,840
tend to be comparatively unstable and violent.

925
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:03,600
So now you can lay that at the feet of the men if you're inclined to, but in some sense

926
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,560
it doesn't really matter, because that's the way it is.

927
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:12,880
And so the women are unhappy and the men are threatened, and that's just not a good recipe

928
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,480
for marital stability.

929
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,120
Everyone loses in this situation.

930
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,560
And so let's talk about another country, Thailand.

931
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:25,520
So you would think if you'd asked me how many women are in college in Thailand,

932
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,200
I might have said 15%.

933
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,640
I have no idea, but no.

934
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,840
It's 55%.

935
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,360
40% of men are in college in Thailand.

936
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,600
So you have a similar shift even there.

937
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:39,920
And what's happening to the men, the documentary, we went to a temple

938
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,000
where monks are trying to rehabilitate young men who fell out of college

939
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,920
or didn't go to college moreover.

940
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:51,280
What they did, age 16, 18, was turn to alcohol, was turn to substances.

941
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,840
To drive taxis because they could get some cash, because there was no point trying to

942
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,800
compete with the women.

943
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,920
So you have these deep societal problems.

944
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,280
But yet they want to be really clear that the answer to this is not

945
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,400
in some way preventing women from getting an education.

946
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,400
That's just not going to function.

947
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,360
How are you going to do that?

948
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,960
You also lose access to half the world's brain power.

949
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,320
Of course, of course.

950
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,840
There are people who think that and there are people who I think want to use this conversation

951
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:25,520
to promote that, because I've seen comments along those lines

952
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,080
too often.

953
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:33,040
This has to be, therefore, partly about men in some way, asking why are men

954
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,160
excluded from society?

955
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:39,440
Why are they becoming incels, or in Japan they call it otaku, the young man who stays home

956
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,040
playing his gaming systems.

957
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,720
I don't think that's the right question.

958
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,040
I think we almost always ask questions backwards.

959
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,040
Why people become useless?

960
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,080
That's not a mystery.

961
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,880
It's easy to be useless.

962
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,840
The mystery is why that doesn't happen to everyone all the time.

963
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:03,840
And the answer is because we build up extremely careful structures of societal discipline

964
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:10,640
to encourage people to adopt mature long-term responsibility and to reward them

965
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,120
judiciously for doing so.

966
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:18,000
And when you allow those structures to collapse or work consciously to undermine them,

967
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,600
then you get default to the default.

968
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,280
And the default is useless.

969
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,880
It's short-term gratification.

970
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,760
And so you never need an explanation for that.

971
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,240
It's like, well, why do people turn to short-term gratification?

972
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,600
Because it's gratifying in the short term.

973
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,240
It's easy.

974
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:44,080
Now, you know, encouraging men to shed their Peter Pan persona, juvenile Peter Pan persona,

975
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:50,240
and to adopt mature responsibility, that's a real challenge for every society.

976
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:57,120
And we are increasingly not only failing at doing that, but punishing young men for developing,

977
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:03,920
say, the virtues of ambition and, well, an even sexual desire for that matter.

978
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,800
So, all right.

979
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,160
So chapter one, you went and interviewed a lot of variety of people

980
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,880
and just started to flesh out the territory.

981
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,320
How does that unfold after that?

982
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:18,400
Well, it comes to the point where I realize,

983
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,720
there's a moment I realize there is a connection across all these countries.

984
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,880
And it's to do with this structure of the family.

985
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,800
You would expect, if you're having fewer children,

986
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:37,280
some of these organizations encourage people to have fewer children, have fewer smaller families,

987
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,880
you would expect if they had had any success or people were doing it,

988
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,360
you would have a lot of families with only one child.

989
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:48,160
But actually, singletons are actually really quite rare in life.

990
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,760
And they're no more common today than they were 30, 40 years ago.

991
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,360
So, I started to discover...

992
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,840
So, you see people with zero children.

993
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,040
Right. That's the only...

994
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,000
How do you get a fertility rate of less than replacement levels?

995
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,560
See, the number of people having one child are none.

996
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:09,760
So, connecting that allowed me to start to ask more questions about childlessness

997
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,280
and about aspirations of life.

998
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,080
And that really...

999
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,720
I see. So, it's not a matter of small families.

1000
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:14,880
No.

1001
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,240
It's a matter of no family.

1002
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:16,640
That's right.

1003
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,040
And then it's a matter of involuntary, no family.

1004
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:19,520
That's right.

1005
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,400
Okay. Got it.

1006
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,040
And that's why I didn't end up doing any regressive analysis,

1007
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,600
because it's a counting problem.

1008
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,280
You know, we were counting this the wrong way.

1009
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,360
You just simply need to look at the number of people having one child,

1010
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,120
two, three, four, and you find this gap,

1011
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,040
and you find that gap getting wider and wider,

1012
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:41,840
and it effectively explains the entire fall below replacement level.

1013
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:44,800
But there's really good news here, too.

1014
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:51,040
The best news in all of this is that if the majority or significant number

1015
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:55,920
of those people who are involuntarily unplanned childlessness, as I call it,

1016
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,560
if they were having a family, they're not going to have one.

1017
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,560
They're going to have, in the same proportions, one, two, three, four, five,

1018
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,640
plus, it's all about having that first child.

1019
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,040
So, the documentary...

1020
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,000
Right. Well, the pre...

1021
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,800
Look, the second child's pretty straightforward after the first.

1022
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,680
And once you've got two, you're already completely screwed.

1023
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,360
So, you might as well have three.

1024
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:18,880
Well, then the kids start to take care of each other, by the way, too,

1025
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,880
which is something that parents don't understand,

1026
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,400
is that, you know, you don't...

1027
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,080
If you have eight kids, it's not like you're taking care of eight kids.

1028
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:29,440
The kids start to form their own society and take care of each other.

1029
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,680
Yeah, and there's great examples of that in the documentary,

1030
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,800
or at least the majority of what you saw in Italy,

1031
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:38,720
this mother of four children saying she educated her eldest daughter,

1032
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,960
taught her how to read, and she taught the next daughter.

1033
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:41,760
She taught the next one.

1034
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,160
The next one. So, that's certainly true.

1035
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:48,480
But the good news is here, because family structure is really locked in,

1036
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,840
once, of course, you know, if you go to some countries,

1037
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:54,880
as I did in Africa, you've got high birth rates because poverty,

1038
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,880
somewhat access to reproductive services,

1039
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,400
but mostly that's covered now.

1040
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,600
Mostly it is.

1041
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:06,080
So, we've got poverty that people in Africa need children to go and get the water.

1042
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,800
But a lot of good things are being done on that.

1043
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,040
That poverty level is coming way down.

1044
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,960
And we're seeing in Africa, on average in sub-Saharan Africa,

1045
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:21,200
just to cover that briefly, the average woman is having one less child every 15 years.

1046
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,560
It's around four now.

1047
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:27,120
So, around 30 years time, we're looking at Africa starting to get down towards replacement level.

1048
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,080
It's on the same path.

1049
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:28,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1050
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,680
That's the reasonable assumption based on the data right now.

1051
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:36,640
So, once you get to that point, and this is what I think the world of demography really

1052
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:45,840
skipped over, is that it's not the same form.

1053
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:49,760
It's not like you look at, you know, families going from four to two and then down to 1.5

1054
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,760
and say, this is the same trend.

1055
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:52,640
It's not.

1056
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:56,640
When you get to replacement level, when women are having pretty much the family size

1057
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,760
that they actually want, childlessness kicks in.

1058
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,640
And it's that that pulls it down a different level.

1059
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,600
So, the next part of the documentary is then going to people,

1060
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:09,360
finding out what their young people, what their aspirations for the future was.

1061
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:15,760
Then also talking to men and women who hadn't had children, why they didn't,

1062
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,440
what it meant to their lives.

1063
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,560
And that gets quite...

1064
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,640
What do you find on the aspirational front?

1065
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:25,600
And, oh, you know, the majority, the significant majority of people,

1066
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,720
young people expect or want of children someday.

1067
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:29,360
Right, right.

1068
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:33,520
Now, I do have some concerns, but no evidence for it, but it's just a natural concern that

1069
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:39,600
what we're seeing in the world today, perhaps as over-focused on the environment, is through fear.

1070
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:40,560
Yeah.

1071
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:45,280
Persuading people more than you would normally expect to not think of children.

1072
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:49,520
But I have hope around that because it's this internal desire really doesn't kick in.

1073
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,400
I think it's not so much fear that's interfering on that front.

1074
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,920
I think it's actually demoralization, right?

1075
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:02,880
Because this is especially true for, let's say, decent young men who would like to be

1076
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,160
moral actors.

1077
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:09,840
If they're told continually which they are, that all of their male pattern behaviors,

1078
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:15,760
for example, in school are disruptive, and that their male ambition is nothing but a

1079
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,320
reflection of the tyrannical patriarchy, and that any interest they might evoke,

1080
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:27,120
they might events towards women, is part of the predatory pattern of male behavior,

1081
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,840
then it demoralizes them.

1082
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:35,280
Literally, it makes them feel like their natural proclivity for ambitious striving,

1083
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:40,080
let's say, and sexual desire is immoral.

1084
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:46,720
And the people you heard the most by doing that are the people who have a moral heart,

1085
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:51,120
because the ones who don't care, and the ones who do, I had a friend.

1086
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:59,680
His name was Rob Dernan, and he was an early, he fell prey to this anti-male narrative very

1087
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,640
early in his life.

1088
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:05,600
This is like 40 years ago, 50 years ago, and he was definitely guilty about

1089
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:11,920
his role as a patriarchal male, let's say, and he did everything he could to adopt a kind of

1090
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,520
nihilistic Buddhism and just take himself out of life.

1091
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:19,920
You know, he thought everything he did was, and everything that men did in general,

1092
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:25,120
was just part of the destructive force that was ravaging the world, and he eventually committed

1093
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,000
suicide.

1094
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,200
It was awful.

1095
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,440
I watched that unfold for 50 years.

1096
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:38,160
And I would say he had his flaws like everyone does, and in that self-destructive pathway,

1097
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:43,040
there can be a fair bit of, let's say, unconscious self-serving.

1098
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:51,200
But fundamentally, he was overwhelmed by existential guilt in relationship to being male,

1099
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,960
and that eventually convinced him to do himself in.

1100
01:03:55,680 --> 01:04:03,040
It was quite the catastrophic voyage, all things considered, and I know perfectly well

1101
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:07,440
that that's not rare, because I've talked to thousands of young men who have been

1102
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:15,120
demoralized to the point of suicide, and that story is, I'd say that's the archetypal story.

1103
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:27,040
So it's not fear exactly, it's an assault, it's a moral assault, and it's unconscionable.

1104
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,800
It's an unconscionable moral assault.

1105
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:35,520
If your solution to saving the planet is that you have to demoralize young people so badly

1106
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:41,440
that they even abstain from sex, then there's seriously something wrong with your worldview.

1107
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:46,000
And maybe we could call out Paul Ehrlich on that front, for example.

1108
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:51,280
So, all right, so now you're starting to talk to people about their aspirations.

1109
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:56,000
You're finding out that young people do want to have a family, and that doesn't mean one child,

1110
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,400
it means a family, but they're not prioritizing that properly?

1111
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,880
Or what happens to the people who end up without children?

1112
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,400
Well, there's no path to it.

1113
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:12,080
The path is education, education, education, usually.

1114
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,440
Not for everyone, but-

1115
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,080
And then debt?

1116
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:15,600
Sure, debt.

1117
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:22,080
But that's not the driver, because education in some countries is much lower than the US,

1118
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,720
so some people will say, oh, debt's the problem.

1119
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,560
It's not a good thing, it can't help.

1120
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,600
And that's career, career, career.

1121
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:34,720
And no one is guiding people to say, actually, there is a moment in time

1122
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,640
when you really need to prioritize this.

1123
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:45,920
We've left young people to find a path on their own, having sent them off as parents,

1124
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:54,560
as societies, to find a path in life that will get them to where they want to be,

1125
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:59,040
which everyone, I think, implicitly assumes, for most people, not all,

1126
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:02,240
will involve love and will involve children.

1127
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:07,200
But actually, what's happening is when young people are getting to that point,

1128
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:15,760
they're often in their 30s, because no one really is thinking that 30 is too late at all.

1129
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:23,200
But just another statistic, if you look across every country we had data on,

1130
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:29,200
the probability of becoming a parent, a mother, rather, it's on women again,

1131
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:35,360
the probability of someone without children age 30 ever becoming a parent at most,

1132
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,440
at most, is 50%.

1133
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:38,800
Really?

1134
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,760
That's just the outcome.

1135
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,160
So by 30?

1136
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:42,960
By 30.

1137
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,600
If you haven't had your first child by 30, and most countries, it's lower than that.

1138
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,560
And why is that?

1139
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,240
There must be multiple causes.

1140
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,320
Part of that would be partnerlessness.

1141
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,560
Part of that would be fertility difficulties.

1142
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,440
What are the major contributors to that?

1143
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,520
The major contributor is not finding a partner at the right time.

1144
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:09,440
Or when you do find a partner, you have challenges.

1145
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:16,160
The other thing that is painful to point out to women is that 30-year-old women

1146
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:20,480
aren't competing with other 30-year-old women for partners.

1147
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:24,720
They're competing with 18 to 35-year-old women for partners.

1148
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:32,000
And so all things considered, if you're 30 and you're looking for a mate and you want children,

1149
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:38,880
you're putting an awful lot of pressure one way or another on your 30-year-old male target.

1150
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:45,200
Because his option is to find a 25-year-old woman who all things being equal

1151
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:49,760
is of the same value as you are, except that you're 30.

1152
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,840
And that means his timeframe is now shortened in a manner that wouldn't be the case

1153
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,280
if he married someone younger.

1154
01:07:55,280 --> 01:08:00,720
Plus, women tend to prefer men who are slightly older than them.

1155
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,000
Well, not exactly slightly.

1156
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,880
It's actually four years is the average internationally.

1157
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:10,560
And so the optimal target for a 25-year-old woman is a 29-year-old man.

1158
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:20,480
And it's rude to point such things out, but mate selection is a very difficult problem.

1159
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:25,280
And it's also exacerbated by the fact that this is also a terrible thing,

1160
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:28,960
is that because of this hypergamous tendency of women, as women,

1161
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:36,320
our guy knew a lot of very successful young women who worked in the legal field.

1162
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:42,640
And they were often stars in their firms, extremely able people.

1163
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:50,240
And generally, they were very vivacious, attractive, intelligent, educated,

1164
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:54,000
and intimidating as hell to men.

1165
01:08:55,280 --> 01:09:00,480
And not that interested in someone who didn't have the same ability and status they did,

1166
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:02,000
which was almost no one.

1167
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,440
So then they're 30.

1168
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:04,800
They're extremely choosy.

1169
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,800
And you could say they have a right to be.

1170
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:11,840
But the problem is, well, yeah, you're 30 and you're extremely choosy.

1171
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:16,080
And your pool of available candidates has basically shrunk to none,

1172
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,920
because first of all, a lot of men are already snapped up by the time they're 30.

1173
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,080
So there's that reduction right off the bat.

1174
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:27,360
And then if you're going to reject, women rate 80% of men on dating sites

1175
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:28,880
as below average in attractiveness.

1176
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:34,880
And that's just the baseline for the women who are high status and high attractive,

1177
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:38,160
let's say, very able on the career front.

1178
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:43,280
And the men they're going to regard as acceptable,

1179
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:46,240
that's a vanishingly small proportion of men.

1180
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:49,840
So that's part of the reason why they, what would you say,

1181
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,800
select themselves out of the mating market.

1182
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,400
That's brutal, man.

1183
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:54,960
It's brutal.

1184
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,280
And I watched women struggle with that like mad,

1185
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,680
and certainly had no shortage of sympathy for them.

1186
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:05,840
But the mere fact that you're sympathetic to someone

1187
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,400
doesn't mean that the brute reality that confronts them

1188
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,240
has been altered in any manner whatsoever.

1189
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,000
Yeah, a couple of points on that.

1190
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,680
So I agree with all of that.

1191
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:20,480
What I see, and I get to, often once or twice a week,

1192
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:24,240
have a coffee with a young person who has reached out.

1193
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:28,160
And you know, when you talk about the documentary or friends or friends or friends,

1194
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,000
someone wants to talk to you about something personal.

1195
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:38,240
A common conversation would be women more than men.

1196
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,720
They've been dating someone for five years.

1197
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:40,960
Yeah.

1198
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,280
They think they might want to, well, different scenarios.

1199
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,360
They think they might want to settle down and have a child with them,

1200
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:48,480
but they've never talked about it.

1201
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,960
Well, it's only been five years.

1202
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:51,280
Right.

1203
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:56,640
Or they've already figured out they probably don't want a child with this person.

1204
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:57,360
What should they do?

1205
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:03,760
Or, worst of all, they've just broken up because they've been dating this guy for seven years,

1206
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:08,160
and he's not got another girlfriend who's 25, and she's pregnant.

1207
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,680
Oh my God, yeah, that's a brutal situation.

1208
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:12,160
Brutal?

1209
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,160
But those are real life stories.

1210
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,960
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's very, yeah, all that's very common.

1211
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,720
So the idea of dating someone for an extended period,

1212
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:24,480
my children are now, you know, 27 to 20,

1213
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:29,200
they're getting to that point where, you know, to me, I'm thinking of my own children

1214
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:33,120
when I think of these young people and the advice I would give them.

1215
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:37,840
And frankly, the advice I usually give, and I'm not a clinical psychologist,

1216
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,160
but, you know, people are asking for advice,

1217
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,800
and I've talked to a lot of people, is if you're unsure,

1218
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,680
break up, because do you know what?

1219
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:49,440
If it feels wrong after you've broken up, you'll get back together quickly.

1220
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,600
And I'd say more.

1221
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,760
The other advice, too, is get the hell at it.

1222
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,760
You think you have a long time to decide.

1223
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,680
Well, here's a way of thinking about it.

1224
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:04,960
If you're reasonably attractive, you'll be able to try out five people.

1225
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:06,480
That's it.

1226
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:11,280
That's what you've got, you know, because it takes a while to find someone,

1227
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,440
and then it takes a while to get to know them.

1228
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:16,320
And finding them and getting to know them,

1229
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:20,320
that's probably something approximating one to two years.

1230
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,720
And if you do that five times, that's 10 years,

1231
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,560
and that's your fertility window.

1232
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:29,040
And so you think you have time, but that's a delusion,

1233
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,200
and you think the right person will come around.

1234
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,200
Well, first of all, that's a delusion to begin with,

1235
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:37,680
because you build a relationship, you don't find one.

1236
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:39,920
Now, you should have some sense when you pick your partner

1237
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,200
to the degree that you have the luxury to have some sense,

1238
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:49,520
but the notion that the person right for you will come along at the right time,

1239
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,600
that's just not the case.

1240
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,200
That isn't how things work at all.

1241
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:56,560
And if you know that even if you're very attractive,

1242
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:00,640
that the list of true candidates is probably five,

1243
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:04,640
and for some people, it's one or zero.

1244
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:10,640
And so that's, it's hard, because when you're 17 or 16,

1245
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,440
especially if you're attractive, and I would say this is especially true

1246
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,120
if you're an attractive young woman,

1247
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,680
you have no shortage, generally speaking,

1248
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,120
of people who are interested in you.

1249
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,320
And it looks like that's sort of a landscape of plenty,

1250
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,200
but that doesn't mitigate against the fact

1251
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,840
that it still takes a long time to get to know people

1252
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,040
and to find the right person.

1253
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,000
Now, men have it a bit easier on that front,

1254
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,880
I would say, because I had one friend who didn't have a child till he was 55.

1255
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,080
That can always be the case for men,

1256
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,880
and so the pressure isn't on in the same way.

1257
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:47,040
But even with men, I married my wife earlier,

1258
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,080
we would have had more kids.

1259
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:50,400
And that didn't happen.

1260
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,680
So, and we got married comparatively early

1261
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:57,040
for our social class, say, and educational background.

1262
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,840
Okay, so now you're talking to people

1263
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,360
and you're finding out they want to have kids,

1264
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,760
and then they find out that they don't get to, right?

1265
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:04,880
A little bit too late.

1266
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,040
And so where does the documentary go from there?

1267
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,760
So, from there, we take it into the consequences.

1268
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:14,720
The consequences, well, they're partly personal,

1269
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,040
but partly economic, but everything ultimately is personal,

1270
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,040
because everything ultimately comes back to,

1271
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,960
whether it's you and your life and how you live,

1272
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,400
and whether you're lonely or not,

1273
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:30,560
or how much the state can help you,

1274
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:31,920
particularly in your later years,

1275
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,680
through healthcare, through pensions,

1276
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:36,160
through your city providing basic services,

1277
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:39,280
like water, it all comes back together.

1278
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:42,000
So we explore a lot of those, and by the way,

1279
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,640
I sat down with, I believe, about a dozen experts,

1280
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:49,840
many professors, many, you know, a priest, a monk,

1281
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:53,200
people involved working with government healthcare programs

1282
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:53,920
around the world.

1283
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:59,120
So we hear these voices, and other than one organization,

1284
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:03,440
which happens to be the successor to what Paul Erlich set up,

1285
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,520
they were the only organization who took an optimistic view.

1286
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,280
Of course, they would do that.

1287
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:10,800
Everybody else is negative.

1288
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,840
Everybody else is worried about the future consequences of this.

1289
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,680
And just by the way, I should call this out.

1290
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,520
Erlich set up an organization,

1291
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:22,320
author of The Population Bomb, of course,

1292
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,160
called ZPG, which evolved into an organization.

1293
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,080
Zero population growth, yeah.

1294
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:28,160
It evolved into another organization

1295
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:32,400
that still has something like 30,000 teachers

1296
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,400
who train other teachers,

1297
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:39,200
who educate 4 million U.S. high school kids every year,

1298
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:43,120
and they explain the population problems,

1299
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,480
usually in Africa.

1300
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:47,760
And their message is, please think about this.

1301
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,000
Yeah, well, there's nothing racist

1302
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,160
about the too many African narrative.

1303
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:56,080
Yeah, and when you teach someone like two and two as four,

1304
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,920
you don't say, think about that.

1305
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,160
But when you say, here's the problem in Africa,

1306
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:02,720
and you say to a, think about that.

1307
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,560
You're not really saying, think about Africa.

1308
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,600
You're thinking about, you know, do you want the kids or not.

1309
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,320
So that's covered in the documentary as well,

1310
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:14,000
as part of the narrative as to why we still have this viewpoint,

1311
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,720
when frankly, we should have known about this decades ago.

1312
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:18,080
Well, we can also look at the

1313
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,240
self-evident economic statistics demonstrating

1314
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:26,560
that since Paul Erlich and his Population Bomb

1315
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,400
and the Club of Rome, et cetera,

1316
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:32,720
these anti-population zealots started beating the drum back in 1965,

1317
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,400
saying that we were all going to starve to death by the year 2000

1318
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,160
when we'll have 4 billion people.

1319
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,840
God help us.

1320
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:44,080
And now we have eight, and the relationship between wealth growth

1321
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:48,560
and population has been extremely positive, not negative or flat.

1322
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:52,080
And everyone on the planet virtually is richer than,

1323
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,000
well, than anyone had ever conceived of.

1324
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
And it's clearly the case that we could manage this

1325
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,920
if we had half the will to do it.

1326
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,480
And so the data are in.

1327
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,360
One of the things I've really learned is that

1328
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,640
I believe the whole idea of natural resource,

1329
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:09,120
almost the whole idea of natural resource is specious.

1330
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,840
In that human beings, the wealth of the planet

1331
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:18,560
is dependent on the psychological health

1332
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,240
and the structures of governance

1333
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:22,320
that are put in place by people of good will.

1334
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,440
And that if we organize ourselves properly and aim up,

1335
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,880
there's no real limit to abundance.

1336
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,680
And it's certainly not population dependent.

1337
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,520
We're not in a zero sum game.

1338
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,080
We are not yeast in a Petri dish.

1339
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:39,200
We're not doomed to a Malthusian outcome.

1340
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,960
And the biologists who make that claim and say it's scientific

1341
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:46,880
are assuming that the yeast in the Petri dish model

1342
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:50,000
of human function is the appropriate biological model.

1343
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:51,520
And it's not.

1344
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:54,880
And the reason for that is because we can let our ideas die

1345
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,760
instead of us and we can learn and we can transform.

1346
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:58,960
And we're very good at that.

1347
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:04,000
And there's no justification whatsoever

1348
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:07,760
for stating that it's a scientific fact

1349
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:11,280
that population increase is going to produce a Malthusian catastrophe.

1350
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:13,120
Now it can in limited circumstances,

1351
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,520
but we are not yeast in a Petri dish.

1352
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:16,560
That's the wrong model.

1353
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,600
So and I can't disagree.

1354
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,520
I mean, I'm a data analyst.

1355
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:24,880
I'm only prepared to comment when I've done my own work

1356
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,360
or I've seen detailed work of others.

1357
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:32,400
I can't imagine how complicated it must be to model the planet.

1358
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,040
I mean, that's on a level beyond anything.

1359
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:38,880
Any rational statistician could do along.

1360
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,280
It's models on top of models on top of models.

1361
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,160
So where I tower of Babel.

1362
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:46,560
So where I come from is to be honest with you.

1363
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,160
I don't know, but I do know that we are adaptive.

1364
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:53,920
I do know that we should prepare because to be honest with you,

1365
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:56,960
you know, green technologies sound like pretty cool things

1366
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,320
when you look at Tesla's out there.

1367
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:59,360
They're not perfect, but they're.

1368
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,360
Remember, I work with a lot of bottom of clients,

1369
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,560
but what Elon has done for the industry, you know, is phenomenal.

1370
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:10,880
And if we come at this from a point of view of positivity,

1371
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,000
what can we do?

1372
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,880
And I look at my own kids and well, their generation,

1373
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:18,000
the malaise, the belief that the world is coming to an end.

1374
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,960
The world is not coming to an end anytime soon.

1375
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,440
Well, unless we precipitated in that direction,

1376
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:27,040
which we seem to be striving to do with all diligence at the moment.

1377
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,080
Well, and to bring it back to the documentary,

1378
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:34,400
at this point, we come back to this point of loneliness and meet people.

1379
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:38,400
I mean, there's a scene where I go to a crematorium in Germany

1380
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:47,840
and I'm hoping to find out something about what it's like to bury people who have no family.

1381
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:51,920
I nearly got an interview directly with the director,

1382
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:56,000
but he refused to meet me and intermediary kind of sat down to explain why.

1383
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:57,600
And it's horrendous.

1384
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:00,640
And so this is off camera.

1385
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:06,800
But I got a long note recently with more information as to what's happening.

1386
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:11,120
People with no family and care homes are being effectively mistreated,

1387
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:14,880
malnourished, tied to their beds for long periods of time.

1388
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:19,280
And we knew this, or it's known in this crematorium,

1389
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:23,840
because the bodies that come are, I guess, white and marked.

1390
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:28,560
And they weren't prepared to say it because they're fearful of the system.

1391
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:32,480
So someone should make a documentary about that alone,

1392
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:37,200
but it tells you that the life of these people without family.

1393
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:42,960
And we can't see it because these people, whether it be in a suburban Japan or in Germany

1394
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,560
or anywhere else, these people are spending their lives in their homes alone,

1395
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,400
hidden from the world.

1396
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:52,320
So the thing is, in our culture, we only seem to be able to apprehend

1397
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,200
life until about 30.

1398
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:56,160
Like, that's our vision.

1399
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,040
You know, the vision is you're young, you're full of promise,

1400
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:03,120
you get educated, you have your career, and then you're 30.

1401
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:04,080
And what's happening?

1402
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,120
Well, now you're successful.

1403
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:08,160
It's like, okay, but you got 60 years left there.

1404
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,080
What are you going to do with that?

1405
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,080
Well, how long is your career going to run you?

1406
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:17,520
Well, you know, lots of people think about early retirement,

1407
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:21,600
and that's particularly perhaps the case if you're successful economically.

1408
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,440
So let's say you retired 50.

1409
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,280
Okay, fair enough.

1410
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:27,840
You got 45 years left.

1411
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:28,960
What's your vision for that?

1412
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,760
Well, now you're alone and you don't have a family.

1413
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,040
You don't have a partner.

1414
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:34,240
You don't have a career either.

1415
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:37,520
So what are you planning to do?

1416
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:38,320
Exactly.

1417
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,520
What's your vision?

1418
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,840
And the answer is we don't have a vision for that.

1419
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,920
We don't have a vision for the expense of our life.

1420
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,680
And so, and that's an interesting thing in and of itself.

1421
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:52,320
I mean, you know, for a long time, back in the 1860s,

1422
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:58,640
people even in the West were struggling along on less than $1.50 a day in today's money.

1423
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:03,680
And it's not like people had the luxury of developing a lifetime vision.

1424
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:07,680
They were sort of fending off one disaster after another,

1425
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:10,480
like people do now who live in absolute privation.

1426
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:13,520
There's about 800 million people like that still on the planet.

1427
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:18,160
And then once you get a little wealthier, a little more secure,

1428
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:19,680
you can start thinking about the future.

1429
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:22,160
And that's very, very complicated.

1430
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:25,760
And this luxurious wealth we have is new enough

1431
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,720
so that our capacity to develop a lifetime vision

1432
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:32,160
hasn't developed to a degree that's sophisticated enough

1433
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,880
to take that whole time span into account.

1434
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:40,400
But this vision of isolated death with no one around you that cares,

1435
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:46,240
I wouldn't recommend that as your life from 70 to 95.

1436
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,360
It's pretty damn dismal.

1437
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:55,360
So, and Jordan, it's going to be worse in less industrialized nations

1438
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:59,280
because you go to Brazil and as professors there, I met three of them,

1439
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:02,400
the phrase they used was,

1440
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:05,040
we're getting old before we got rich in Brazil.

1441
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:05,600
Right.

1442
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,880
So they can't provide the infrastructure resources to the elderly

1443
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:10,800
on a level comparable to what we can.

1444
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:16,320
So the life of elderly people, so when I look at India

1445
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:19,280
with the birth rate now, below replacement level,

1446
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,280
growing population because it's so young,

1447
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,120
people are living longer, which is a good thing.

1448
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:27,040
But I'm looking at a future for India 30 years from now

1449
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,360
where you're going to have so many old people

1450
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,760
and so few people to take care of them.

1451
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:37,280
So this is a problem that we focus too much on

1452
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:38,640
in our own societies.

1453
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:42,160
This is a global humanitarian crisis of old people

1454
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:45,760
who are going to be left by and large to some extent

1455
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:46,800
to fend for themselves.

1456
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,320
And when they're outfending for themselves,

1457
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:52,080
they're going to be mostly in their homes or alone.

1458
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:56,400
I find the psychological argument, I would say,

1459
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,240
probably more compelling.

1460
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:03,280
I think not because I take any issue to your forward-looking projections

1461
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:06,480
but because things are so unstable

1462
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:09,360
on the technological and economic and political front

1463
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,640
that projecting even a decade into the future

1464
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:14,720
seems in some ways like a fool's errand, right?

1465
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:18,240
Because God only knows what's coming down the pipelines

1466
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:21,120
with regards to new technology.

1467
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,840
But I think you can make an extraordinarily strong case

1468
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:27,600
that one of the things you don't want to end up happening

1469
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:32,080
to you in your own life is to be involuntarily childless

1470
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:36,720
and isolated starting at the age of 30 going forward, right?

1471
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:41,760
And so I do, you know, I've looked at the situation in China

1472
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,800
and in Japan with this, what do they call that,

1473
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:47,200
the inverted pyramidal distribution

1474
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,440
where there's way more old people than young people.

1475
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:52,320
And obviously that seems untenable on the technological

1476
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,680
or on the economic front.

1477
01:24:54,240 --> 01:25:01,760
But I do think the psychological issue is much more present,

1478
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:03,600
should be much more present for young people.

1479
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,160
And the warning is don't be thinking you've got a lot of time

1480
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,040
to get your act together

1481
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,200
because you don't have as much time as you think

1482
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:12,400
and you want to get things going sooner than you

1483
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,960
might find it convenient.

1484
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,640
There's never a convenient time to have a child.

1485
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,600
There's stupid times to have a child for sure,

1486
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,040
but there's never a convenient time.

1487
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:22,800
And that's the other thing people do too, you know.

1488
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:26,320
When my wife and I finally got together,

1489
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:27,520
she was about 28 or so,

1490
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:30,960
she wanted to have a kid pretty, you know, pretty much right away.

1491
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,560
And I was finishing off my post-doc

1492
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:36,320
and I hadn't got a permanent job yet.

1493
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:40,080
And my sense was, well, you know, everything's not in place.

1494
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,000
And we talked that out for quite a while

1495
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,080
and decided to proceed regardless

1496
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:48,400
because there was no real reason for me to be concerned.

1497
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,400
The probability that I was going to be jobless

1498
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,360
was barring catastrophes zero.

1499
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:57,840
And you jump into the abyss holding hands with your wife,

1500
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,760
you know, there's no right time.

1501
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:02,800
And the reason that's so important to know

1502
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,440
is because the clock ticks while you're waiting,

1503
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,280
and that's also a catastrophe.

1504
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:10,640
And then it sneaks up on people unaware as you just described

1505
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:12,560
and takes them out, not good.

1506
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:14,480
Okay, so now you're talking,

1507
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,320
now you're investigating in the documentary

1508
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,280
the consequences of this involuntary childlessness

1509
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:21,840
and do you progress past that?

1510
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:25,520
Yeah, well, so the consequences go into both the economic,

1511
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:26,880
we go to Detroit,

1512
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,040
we look at what might happen to the future

1513
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:30,960
of the world based on what's happened to Detroit.

1514
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:31,200
Yeah.

1515
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:37,040
Yeah, we look at briefly future pension systems,

1516
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:40,800
we look at AI technology, but only very briefly.

1517
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,400
It's an area that I'm sure many people

1518
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,320
like you mentioned technology just now,

1519
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:49,040
but a comment for me is that robots don't pay taxes.

1520
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:50,080
So simply saying this will be-

1521
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,480
They also don't necessarily want to take care of you.

1522
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,040
So we'll just see how that works out.

1523
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,040
And I think they're going to be expensive.

1524
01:26:57,040 --> 01:27:00,080
So the idea that AI is a solution just like this

1525
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:05,280
is probably oversimplified, possibly very oversimplified,

1526
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:06,320
but of course it has a role,

1527
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,560
technology definitely has a role in this.

1528
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,320
But we can't just turn away from this subject

1529
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:12,480
and say, let's not worry about it for that reason.

1530
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:14,800
The final part of the documentary,

1531
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,960
and I have to credit a friend,

1532
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:20,080
I thought it was done after filming in probably teen countries.

1533
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:21,440
I thought, well, this is enough now,

1534
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,440
kind of I can see the global pattern.

1535
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:27,360
And this friend in LA said, no, you haven't finished,

1536
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,720
you have to go to Africa.

1537
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:30,880
And you have to go to other countries like Bangladesh.

1538
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:33,600
And India had already been to,

1539
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:34,880
but I wanted to more filming.

1540
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:35,760
I wanted to go into-

1541
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,760
We went to slums in Mumbai.

1542
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:43,120
We went to slums in Rio, I think five in Johannesburg.

1543
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:47,280
And I wanted to see what's happening in the parts of the world

1544
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:51,200
that I think to some extent we might fear are exploding.

1545
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:55,760
And you have the same fundamental story

1546
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:58,480
happening everywhere, even Nigeria.

1547
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:03,680
So Nigeria is a good example of a country

1548
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:08,640
that's moving towards low birth rates at a much slower pace.

1549
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:11,200
There'll be more people, by the way, in Nigeria

1550
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:13,440
by the year 2100 than there are in China

1551
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,200
for everyone watching at least.

1552
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,520
That's quite the shocking bit of information.

1553
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,360
Yeah, and you look at Nigeria,

1554
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,760
you look at Nigeria and you still have a culture there

1555
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,240
where the more male children you have,

1556
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:27,440
it's part of what you might say, the bravado that you have.

1557
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:30,320
Yeah, yeah, that's that status reward status.

1558
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,880
But you go to Ethiopia and you meet people there

1559
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,080
and you talk to professors there.

1560
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:35,680
And Ethiopia used to be like that,

1561
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:37,920
but the birth rate right now in Ethiopia is four.

1562
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:40,000
It used to be seven or eight, not that long ago,

1563
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,480
and there's a transformation happening.

1564
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:46,160
So you can see and feel the transformation happening in Africa,

1565
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:47,360
just like everywhere else.

1566
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,960
So I like to think of the analogy

1567
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,880
that the world is on a rollercoaster

1568
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:55,040
and countries like Japan and Germany and Italy

1569
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,760
and now South Korea are in the front car.

1570
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:00,240
They're over in terms of the peak population

1571
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:03,200
and sure they're aging and people are going to live longer

1572
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:05,280
and longer, so we're not going to really see

1573
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:08,640
the drop for a little while, but we know what's coming.

1574
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:11,360
Africa is in the rear car.

1575
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:14,480
They're still on the way up, but the path is the same here.

1576
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:19,200
Yeah, but perhaps the thing that struck me about Africa,

1577
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:22,240
where I'm planning to go back and spend a significant amount of time

1578
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:25,440
for my own purposes as much as anything,

1579
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:28,240
when you go to Africa, you go to Malawi,

1580
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:30,320
which is, I believe, World Bank data,

1581
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:34,000
the 12th poorest country in the world by GDP per person.

1582
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:39,440
And you go to a community and people are laughing, smiling.

1583
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,520
And you go to kind of an area, it's not even a soccer pitch,

1584
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:46,000
it's nothing like a soccer pitch, but there's a soccer ball there.

1585
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,920
There's no rules, but you've got 30 kids running and screaming and laughing.

1586
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:53,040
And we're there, and they come and say hi for a moment,

1587
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:55,040
but they want to get back and play soccer with each other.

1588
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:58,320
And to see that sense of community

1589
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,360
and that intergenerational community,

1590
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:05,360
maybe in some ways part of a solution here that we've,

1591
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:08,240
I think an argument for me is that we've lost a sense of community

1592
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:09,440
for one reason or another.

1593
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:18,720
And so that's something that surprised me, actually, how similar, really,

1594
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:23,600
we all are, and we're just different parts of that cycle.

1595
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,800
So you've laid out this documentary,

1596
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:34,000
and you've documented a problem that is not being attended to much.

1597
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,960
That's a very pervasive problem,

1598
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:42,720
and that's going to affect virtually everyone personally and sociologically.

1599
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:46,080
We talked a little bit about pathways.

1600
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,920
It's one thing, obviously, to diagnose a problem,

1601
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,000
and that's not a straightforward thing to do,

1602
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,840
to see the problem and then to diagnose it.

1603
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:58,160
It's a completely different order of things to start thinking about

1604
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:00,560
what might constitute an acceptable alternative.

1605
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:03,200
So in Hungary, what they've done, you probably know this,

1606
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:07,680
is that if you're a mother in Hungary and you have one child,

1607
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:12,320
you're now exempt from income tax at the federal level for the rest of your life,

1608
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:17,200
25%, and then that scales up to 100% for four children.

1609
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:20,240
And the idea there was both practical and cultural.

1610
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:25,840
So the cultural idea was we need to signal that we value motherhood and children.

1611
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:32,880
And one of the more powerful signals that society has access to

1612
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:33,920
is economic signals.

1613
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:38,160
And the Hungarians have stopped the decline in their birth rate and tapped it up slightly.

1614
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:41,920
They've increased female participation in the workforce, by the way, 13%.

1615
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:45,120
So the feminists had objected, or some of them,

1616
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:49,360
that the Hungarian government was just turning women into baby-making factories,

1617
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:54,080
which is hell of a nasty epithet, I might add.

1618
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:56,480
But what's happened is the reverse.

1619
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:58,400
As more women are working now than before,

1620
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:00,640
and I suppose that's because they get to keep more of their money,

1621
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:05,520
and they can make childcare arrangements more straightforwardly and all of that,

1622
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,560
they've knocked a divorce rate down substantively.

1623
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,160
They've increased the marriage rate.

1624
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:15,040
They've knocked the abortion rate down 40%, 38%, with no compulsion.

1625
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:19,520
It's not as easy to get an abortion in Hungary as it is in the US or Canada.

1626
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:25,520
And the legal limits there is 12 weeks instead of the 16 weeks,

1627
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,080
which is about what Americans think it should be.

1628
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:36,320
But the point is these alterations in policy have produced increases in fertility,

1629
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:39,200
increases in the marital rate, decreases in the divorce rate,

1630
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:43,360
decreases in the abortion rate, and those look arguably like desirable things.

1631
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:48,560
And we talked a little bit about the fact that women live seven years longer,

1632
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:52,720
and so in principle, have a time, let's say eight years,

1633
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:56,880
where they could have children without really being at a competitive disadvantage

1634
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:01,040
on the economic front with men, assuming that it is a competitive landscape,

1635
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:03,200
and that's also not particularly obvious to me.

1636
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:11,600
I mean, have your thoughts turned to what might constitute an appropriate pathway forward

1637
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:12,800
for young people?

1638
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:20,000
Well, I certainly would quite boldly say what will not work,

1639
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,600
because there's so many examples of things that have been tried and tried and tried and tried.

1640
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:26,000
Now, we'll come back to Hungary in a moment, because it is very interesting.

1641
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:31,680
But if you look at baby bonus programs globally,

1642
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:35,840
at best, what they do is temporarily increase the birth rate,

1643
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:40,560
and then you see a dip, and the dip usually goes below where it was before.

1644
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:46,160
All you've done is bring forward the people who would have had kids anyway.

1645
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:47,600
Yeah, yeah, right, right.

1646
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:51,440
So we, and you look at the amount of money in certain Japan,

1647
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:54,240
certainly South Korea are spending on kindergarten.

1648
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:55,680
Yeah, yeah, that doesn't seem to help.

1649
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:57,200
Quebec, it didn't make a bit of difference.

1650
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:57,760
Yeah, yeah.

1651
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:58,480
No, it isn't.

1652
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:01,040
It isn't lack of childcare that's causing this problem.

1653
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:02,720
Yeah, and it's not income either.

1654
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:03,840
No, right.

1655
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,360
A lot of people think it is income.

1656
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:07,440
It's a natural thing, I think, for people thinking,

1657
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:10,000
well, if I had a little bit more money at the right time,

1658
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,240
or my apartment's too small,

1659
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:16,400
but actually what you find is that when people have more money in their pocket,

1660
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:17,440
birth rates go down.

1661
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:17,600
Yeah, right.

1662
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,400
They do other things.

1663
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:18,800
Yeah, yeah.

1664
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,960
It's like, not yet, we can take this vacation.

1665
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,000
Well, I think also,

1666
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:26,080
well, I also think that their expectations for what constitutes

1667
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:28,720
sufficiently prepared for children also change.

1668
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,440
Like I said, when I was in Montreal,

1669
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,040
well, I was already educated.

1670
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:33,840
I had a job.

1671
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,360
It was clear I was going to get a job,

1672
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:38,800
but my standard for what was sufficient security

1673
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:40,320
and opportunity for my children

1674
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:43,920
rose along with my horizon of vision on the economic front.

1675
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:47,280
And it's also not the case that more security makes you

1676
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,920
likeable to take more risks.

1677
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:51,200
That isn't how life works.

1678
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:52,640
You have to jump into children,

1679
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:54,880
just like you jump into a marriage

1680
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:57,360
or into your life for that matter.

1681
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:58,640
I think that's the key point.

1682
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:01,920
So ultimately, Hungary aside for a moment,

1683
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:03,280
and also Russia in the past,

1684
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:04,880
has had similar programs

1685
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:07,680
where they have put significant benefits in place

1686
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:09,440
that seem to work for a time.

1687
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:14,880
But vast majority of financial incentives

1688
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:17,920
or even societal changes

1689
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,840
such as kindergartens have very limited effects,

1690
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,520
very limited indeed.

1691
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:25,200
Now, if we come back to understand

1692
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:26,320
the fundamentals of the problem,

1693
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:29,520
there's this unplanned childlessness issue.

1694
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:33,840
Perhaps what Hungary might have got right,

1695
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:39,600
and I will never frankly tell someone

1696
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,200
you should or should not have an abortion.

1697
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:42,000
That's your choice.

1698
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,080
That's not something I want to have any say.

1699
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:46,400
I don't believe that's my right to say that.

1700
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:48,640
That's just my personal position on it.

1701
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:52,560
But what Hungary might have done,

1702
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:54,640
and you stated a moment ago,

1703
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:59,120
is just make it more positive, the idea of parenting.

1704
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:00,560
It's something that people want to do.

1705
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:01,680
That's what they're aiming at.

1706
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:04,800
The Hungarians do understand.

1707
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,640
So their president, Catalan Novak,

1708
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:11,040
young dynamic woman who is their symbolic head of state,

1709
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:13,680
was very much involved in the formulation

1710
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:14,960
of these family policies.

1711
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:18,800
And she knew perfectly well that part of what the goal was,

1712
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:23,040
was to culturally elevate the, let's call it,

1713
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,960
the sacred significance of motherhood,

1714
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:25,680
something like that,

1715
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:30,720
to put the mother again on something approximating

1716
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,400
the necessary pedestal.

1717
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,880
You see this in Catholic imagery all the time,

1718
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:37,600
is that, of course, in the Christian tradition,

1719
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,600
Christ is obviously the central figure

1720
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:41,120
of redemption and divinity,

1721
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:44,720
but there's strong competition symbolically

1722
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:45,840
on the part of Mary,

1723
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,440
because it's Mary and the infant.

1724
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:49,280
And I would say any society

1725
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:51,920
that doesn't hold the mother and infant as sacred is doomed.

1726
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:54,480
For obvious reasons,

1727
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:56,960
since we all had mothers and were all infants,

1728
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:00,400
if you don't value that, whatever that value means.

1729
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:02,080
And when my wife had little kids,

1730
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:05,760
she was treated pretty damn dismal, I would say.

1731
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:07,920
I used to go out to restaurants with her

1732
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:10,080
and just watch when she entered in with the kids.

1733
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,840
And there was a lot of sneers

1734
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:16,480
and a lot of casual mistreatment.

1735
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:19,280
There was no, they were a nuisance.

1736
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:21,600
And that was extremely annoying to me to watch,

1737
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,200
because I don't think of kids as,

1738
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:25,440
kids can be nuisances if they're not well behaved,

1739
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:27,920
but there's something wrong with you

1740
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:30,400
if you think children are fundamentally a nuisance.

1741
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:35,360
And it's definitely the case that we don't value

1742
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:40,880
the contribution of young mothers in our culture,

1743
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:43,680
the way that we would if we were wise.

1744
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:46,400
And that's a very difficult problem to solve, right?

1745
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:49,600
All this emphasis on the kind of hedonic freedom

1746
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:52,800
that's associated with being a youthful teenager.

1747
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,960
And then that equally sex in the city,

1748
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:59,200
nonsense about your freedom on the sexual front,

1749
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:00,480
while you're pursuing your career,

1750
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:03,280
so bloody juvenile that it's almost incomprehensible.

1751
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:05,040
But it's not an easy thing to reverse.

1752
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:06,480
And it isn't even obvious

1753
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:09,360
that it's the government's role to reverse that,

1754
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:12,800
but, and the outcomes are unplanned childlessness.

1755
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:14,560
I, you know, just time and time again,

1756
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:19,280
I think it's just clear that people who go down that path

1757
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:21,120
are thinking of what society tells them

1758
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:22,800
they can do in the short term only.

1759
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:27,280
That'd be a good title for this interview, really.

1760
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:29,520
We should probably call it unplanned childlessness.

1761
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:30,160
I love that.

1762
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:32,320
Well, because that is so,

1763
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:36,960
it's so interesting that that exists as such a plague,

1764
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:38,400
and yet it isn't identified,

1765
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,000
and it doesn't have a name.

1766
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,240
And that's a real, that's a real catastrophe.

1767
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:45,520
I, you know, one of the earliest greetings I did,

1768
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:47,600
there was a young man who was in Japan,

1769
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:48,880
but he was, he's from the U.S.

1770
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:52,400
And he just stood there afterwards gazing at the ceiling,

1771
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:55,360
and he's probably 30, early 30, 35.

1772
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:58,240
And he said, unplanned childlessness.

1773
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:00,640
And he looked at me and said, that's me.

1774
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:03,040
That's me.

1775
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:05,920
And you could see it wasn't just the term,

1776
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:06,960
it was talking.

1777
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:07,440
Yeah, right.

1778
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:08,000
He was talking.

1779
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:08,800
The realization.

1780
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:09,520
Realization.

1781
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:12,960
You actually have to, in some way, have a plan,

1782
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:16,640
even if the plan is to do something not irrational,

1783
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:21,360
but to take a leap of faith and to come back to men as well.

1784
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:25,120
Men can have children aged 55.

1785
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:32,160
You know, I divorced, sadly, at around 40, I guess,

1786
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:34,880
and I thought there'd be a time where I would meet someone again

1787
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:35,680
and have more children.

1788
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:37,360
That's something I would have desired, frankly.

1789
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:41,920
Not to get too personal, but it wasn't my plan for life

1790
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:43,520
to be a divorced dad.

1791
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:44,560
Right, right.

1792
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:50,160
And what you find is that you're competing with younger men

1793
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:51,120
for the same younger woman.

1794
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:52,160
Easier said than done.

1795
01:39:52,160 --> 01:39:53,280
Easier said than done.

1796
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:55,680
The fact that you can technically have a child

1797
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:59,360
at almost any age as a man doesn't mean that you're going to.

1798
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,560
So the outcome is...

1799
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:01,280
No, no, no.

1800
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:03,520
What makes you think you're going to be more successful,

1801
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:06,000
old and ugly, than you had been young and ugly?

1802
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:07,680
So, yeah, yeah.

1803
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:10,400
And every year you're on the path to get older and uglier.

1804
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:16,400
So, you know, it's men and women in this situation,

1805
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:19,200
I think, that society needs to make parenting

1806
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,440
something more valuable.

1807
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:24,080
But to come back to your point, that cannot be

1808
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:26,640
at the sacrifice of career education options.

1809
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:31,200
We have to make it more almost the default option

1810
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:34,640
that you can continue your education.

1811
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:37,120
I love the idea of lifelong learning, which is what I'm doing.

1812
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:41,840
Yeah, well, it's very odd that we orient our educational

1813
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:44,320
establishments to people between 18 and 22.

1814
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:45,520
I just can't figure that at all.

1815
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:47,600
I taught at the Harvard Extension School, by the way.

1816
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:50,800
I had a lot of adult students and I enjoyed teaching them a lot.

1817
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,520
There's absolutely no reason whatsoever

1818
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:56,720
that the university should specialize in 18 to 22-year-olds.

1819
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:01,200
That's a hangover from, I don't know, God,

1820
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:03,840
I don't even know when that was useful and relevant.

1821
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:05,920
It's just not a smart idea.

1822
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:08,800
And it's in the college's interest, because as a shrinking number

1823
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:11,760
of children come through the systems,

1824
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:14,160
universities are going to need to diversify.

1825
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:16,400
Lifelong learning is the answer to that.

1826
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:17,040
So why?

1827
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:19,440
Well, it's also the case that in an era of rapid

1828
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:22,880
technological transformation, that lifelong learning is

1829
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:24,160
necessary practically.

1830
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:26,640
But it's also, why the hell wouldn't you want that?

1831
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:28,320
Because it's part of what keeps you updated.

1832
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:31,760
I remember the first class I took at the Extension School.

1833
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:34,160
It was in statistics that I went to my first class,

1834
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:36,400
probably dressed like I am now with a leather briefcase.

1835
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:40,880
And everyone else, I was not the oldest at all.

1836
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:43,920
But everyone else is in jeans and t-shirts and backpacks.

1837
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:48,080
And I thought, well, I haven't dressed like that for decades.

1838
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:51,120
But I went out and I got a couple of t-shirts and a backpack.

1839
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:55,760
And the most transformational thing happened to me.

1840
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:59,760
First recognition, I'm learning something I want to learn.

1841
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:00,320
Yeah, right?

1842
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:01,520
I'm fully engaged.

1843
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:03,840
And that makes you the best kind of student, too.

1844
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:04,640
I think so.

1845
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:08,720
But everyone else, there were Harvard College kids there

1846
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:09,840
taking summer classes.

1847
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,200
And there were people older than me.

1848
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,000
It didn't matter.

1849
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:14,720
I love teaching at the Extension School.

1850
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:19,600
I mean, at Harvard, the undergraduates in the formal school

1851
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,960
were smarter than the people on average in the Extension

1852
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:23,520
School.

1853
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:26,240
But the Extension School people were a lot more motivated

1854
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:26,640
to learn.

1855
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:30,320
There was no one not attending because they were there

1856
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:32,000
because they wanted to be there, right?

1857
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,320
So I'm probably asking questions that were,

1858
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:37,920
I actually took a psychology class probably in the building

1859
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:39,200
of William James.

1860
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:40,160
Yeah, William James.

1861
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:40,560
Yeah.

1862
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:46,320
And again, I was there with a lot of even high school learners

1863
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:47,360
at a summer school program.

1864
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:50,000
But I realized the professor was enjoying the questions

1865
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:50,640
I was asking.

1866
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:50,800
Yeah, yeah.

1867
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,480
But they were just different to the question.

1868
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:52,880
Yeah, yeah.

1869
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:54,080
They're serious questions, right?

1870
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:54,720
Yeah.

1871
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:55,680
So when were you there?

1872
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:58,800
I started in 2015, 2016.

1873
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:01,200
I would have taken the psychology probably one-on-one,

1874
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:01,600
of course.

1875
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:08,640
But the point is that the recruitment cycle for many career

1876
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:10,800
options is linked to the education cycle.

1877
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,560
So you can't change one without the other.

1878
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:13,120
Yeah, yeah.

1879
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:15,600
You have enough people say, well, it's fine.

1880
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:18,560
Certain companies allow recruitment later in life,

1881
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:20,080
but it's not the normal thing to do.

1882
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:20,160
Yeah.

1883
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:20,800
It's a risk.

1884
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:24,320
So if you're a woman or a parent taking time out to raise

1885
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:27,600
a family because you think you want to do that exclusively

1886
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:31,120
on your own, that's a risk that you might not get on that path

1887
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:32,480
and you might not get the recruitment.

1888
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:34,480
Yeah, you know, I don't really buy that.

1889
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:36,960
I don't really buy that because I had one student,

1890
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:42,480
for example, Shelly Carson.

1891
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:48,960
She came back to Harvard as a graduate student in her 40s.

1892
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:51,600
I was younger than her as her supervisor.

1893
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:54,400
She'd been an airline stewardess, pretty middle-class life,

1894
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:57,280
had been out of the academic stream for quite a while,

1895
01:43:57,280 --> 01:44:00,400
and was quite a lot older than most of the graduate students.

1896
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:04,640
And she hit it hard and developed a bang-up career,

1897
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:06,640
and she's managed that quite successfully.

1898
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:09,680
And I think that that's not normal.

1899
01:44:09,680 --> 01:44:12,480
It's not the standard practice, but it's by no means impossible.

1900
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:15,360
And given that women do have that seven-year advantage

1901
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:20,720
in terms of lifespan, there's, man, you think you're out of the running

1902
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:23,760
on the education and career front when you're 35.

1903
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:26,000
You're out of the running on the reproductive front.

1904
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:26,400
Yes.

1905
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:29,040
You're not really out of the running on the education and career front.

1906
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:34,160
And I've seen lots of people hit the education ground running

1907
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:38,960
in their 30s, mid-30s, sometimes later, and have a whole new career.

1908
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:43,040
I mean, Jesus, at 40, you could still have 30 years at your new career.

1909
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:43,760
Yeah.

1910
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:46,640
So that's a very optimistic way of looking at it.

1911
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:47,360
Yeah.

1912
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:51,200
And so, all right, so well, for everybody watching and listening on YouTube

1913
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:55,040
and its associated platforms, thank you very much for your time and attention.

1914
01:44:55,840 --> 01:45:00,880
And to Stephen Shaw for agreeing to talk to me today about birth gap

1915
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:06,240
and about the issue of declining birth rates and population shrinkage,

1916
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:11,520
bringing that to everyone's attention, bringing the issue of unplanned

1917
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:16,000
childlessness to everyone's attention, because that's a crucial issue here

1918
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,200
to note the existence of a problem and to give it a name

1919
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:22,320
is to bring it out of the darkness and to unshroud it, let's say.

1920
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:24,800
And that's an extremely useful thing to do.

1921
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:30,400
And I'm going to talk to Stephen for another half an hour on the DailyWirePlus platform.

1922
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:33,200
I like to spend half an hour with my guests,

1923
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:38,880
investigating how their pathway through life made it manifest,

1924
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:43,360
made itself manifest to them both in terms of the problems that gripped them,

1925
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:47,520
the concerns they had, both voluntary and involuntary,

1926
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:50,400
and the opportunities that presented themselves as a consequence.

1927
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:55,200
And so if you're interested in that, then please head over to the DailyWirePlus platform.

1928
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:57,120
You could consider supporting them in any case.

1929
01:45:57,120 --> 01:46:03,280
They have also worked diligently to make the kind of conversations I had today possible.

1930
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:06,720
And that's much appreciated to the film crew here in Vancouver,

1931
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:07,840
because that's where I am today.

1932
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:08,800
Thank you very much.

1933
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:11,680
And thank you all for your time and attention.

1934
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:13,280
Good to talk with you.

1935
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:13,760
Yeah.

1936
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:14,640
Yeah, you bet.

1937
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:15,040
You bet.

1938
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:16,800
Hello, everyone.

1939
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:27,280
I would encourage you to continue listening to my conversation with my guest on DailyWirePlus.com.
