WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.420
It's the Hebrews created history as we know it.

00:06.420 --> 00:10.500
You don't get away with anything and so you might think you can bend the fabric of reality

00:10.500 --> 00:14.500
and that you can treat people instrumentally and that you can bow to the tyrant and violate

00:14.500 --> 00:16.120
your conscience without cost.

00:16.120 --> 00:17.420
You will pay the piper.

00:17.420 --> 00:22.100
It's going to call you out of that slavery into freedom even if that pulls you into the

00:22.100 --> 00:23.100
desert.

00:24.100 --> 00:30.700
And we're going to see that there's something else going on here that is far more cosmic

00:30.700 --> 00:33.180
and deeper than what you can imagine.

00:33.180 --> 00:41.460
The highest ethical spirit to which we're beholden is presented precisely as that spirit

00:41.460 --> 00:45.940
that allies itself with the cause of freedom against tyranny.

00:45.940 --> 00:46.940
Yes, exactly.

00:46.940 --> 00:48.460
I want villains to get punished.

00:48.460 --> 00:52.140
But do you want the villains to learn before they have to pay the ultimate price?

00:52.140 --> 00:54.500
That's such a Christian question.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.620
You're optimizing for minimal impact and I think that is really the core of the modern

01:09.620 --> 01:10.620
environmental movement.

01:10.620 --> 01:15.420
It's not this just blanket collective desire for as much life as possible and we're somehow

01:15.420 --> 01:16.740
getting in the way of that.

01:16.740 --> 01:18.220
It's specifically against us.

01:18.300 --> 01:19.660
They discovered the greenhouse effect.

01:19.660 --> 01:26.540
They said this is going to on its own make the earth a much more lush place.

01:26.540 --> 01:29.700
They speculated like the fruits are going to be bigger and everything is going to be

01:29.700 --> 01:34.220
lush because we're going to have more farmland and more biological and it's kind of obvious.

01:34.220 --> 01:40.060
If you have a warmer world with more CO2, it's a more tropical world with more life.

01:40.060 --> 01:44.380
It's a more green world in the life sense of green and yet the green movement hates

01:44.380 --> 01:46.540
it because we caused it.

01:46.540 --> 01:52.340
They can see no good in anything we caused even when it leads to more biological productivity.

01:52.340 --> 01:59.140
It's fundamentally an anti-human movement, not a pro-life of any kind movement.

01:59.140 --> 02:05.740
The ineluctable conclusion that has to be drawn from that proposition is that any human

02:05.740 --> 02:12.340
activity whatsoever is to be regarded as evil even if it increases total biological flourishing

02:12.340 --> 02:19.380
in terms of let's say the net metric tonnage of biological life on the planet.

02:19.380 --> 02:24.180
So that's also perverse because that is definitely a game that none of us can win.

02:24.180 --> 02:30.820
If the a prior rule is no matter what you do, you're evil, then the only solution to that

02:30.820 --> 02:46.700
is well how about a hell of a lot fewer of you.

02:46.700 --> 02:52.420
Hello everyone watching and listening on YouTube or the associated podcast platforms.

02:52.420 --> 02:55.220
I have with me today Alex Epstein.

02:55.220 --> 02:57.420
I'm looking forward to this discussion.

02:57.420 --> 03:03.680
He's a philosopher and energy expert who argues that human flourishing should be the guiding

03:03.680 --> 03:09.740
principle and the appropriate metric for our energy and environmental policy and our determination

03:09.740 --> 03:11.060
of its progress.

03:11.060 --> 03:17.700
He's the author of the new book, Fossil Future, as well as the New York Times bestseller,

03:17.700 --> 03:21.540
The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels, which was published in 2014.

03:21.540 --> 03:27.980
He's also the creator of energytalkingpoints.com, a source of powerful, well-referenced talking

03:27.980 --> 03:32.020
points on energy, environmental, and climate issues.

03:32.020 --> 03:38.220
Epstein began his work in 2011 with the founding of the Center for Industrial Progress, a for-profit

03:38.220 --> 03:43.300
think tank offering insights into the world of fossil fuels and fighting back against

03:43.300 --> 03:48.660
the mainstream narrative of so-called environmentalism.

03:48.660 --> 03:53.620
Only recognized as a master of persuasion and debate on energy issues, Alex has spoken

03:53.620 --> 03:59.220
to dozens of Fortune 500 companies and at dozens of prominent universities, including

03:59.220 --> 04:03.980
Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and Duke, his alma mater.

04:03.980 --> 04:09.420
He's also a highly sought-after consultant on messaging, working with dozens of major

04:09.420 --> 04:14.500
political offices on pro-energy, pro-freedom messaging.

04:14.500 --> 04:21.740
We're here today to talk about the moral necessity of an energy-rich future, one that

04:21.740 --> 04:29.020
both must and should rely on the abundant provision of the petro-based fuels so carelessly currently

04:29.020 --> 04:30.540
demonized.

04:30.540 --> 04:38.180
So welcome to all of you who are watching or listening, and welcome to Alex.

04:38.180 --> 04:42.380
So maybe we could just start by having you walk through the book.

04:42.380 --> 04:48.620
One of the things I found interesting to begin with was your discussion of the motivations,

04:48.620 --> 04:54.100
let's say, of some of the more radical people that are pushing what is purported to be a

04:54.100 --> 04:56.180
pro-environment stance.

04:56.180 --> 05:04.420
People like Paul Ehrlich, who clearly have an agenda that could be more accurately conceptualized

05:04.420 --> 05:11.420
as anti-human, certainly anti-industrial, rather than pro-environment.

05:11.420 --> 05:16.420
And I think that's something that's worthwhile alerting everyone too, especially given the

05:16.420 --> 05:21.900
current state of energy price increase in Europe, let's say, and the consequences that's going

05:21.900 --> 05:24.100
to have for the poor around the world.

05:24.100 --> 05:26.100
Let's start with that, though.

05:26.100 --> 05:28.520
You wrote this book in 2014.

05:28.520 --> 05:33.340
Let's talk about why you wrote it and how you think your prognostications have fared

05:33.340 --> 05:36.220
in what's almost an intervening decade.

05:36.220 --> 05:40.520
Well, I think one thing that's relevant, I'm not sure if you know this, but there's a new

05:40.520 --> 05:45.640
book, 2022, called Fossil Future, which is the successor or replacement to the moral

05:45.640 --> 05:47.500
case for fossil fuels.

05:47.500 --> 05:52.540
So I talk a bunch in that about how the moral case for fossil fuels has fared.

05:52.540 --> 05:57.100
And I think in terms of a predictive book, it's not primarily a predictive book, but

05:57.100 --> 05:59.340
it has been extremely accurate.

05:59.340 --> 06:03.220
Because if you look at what people have said in the last eight or so years, the main

06:03.220 --> 06:07.340
narratives have been, we're not going to need fossil fuels as much as we used to.

06:07.340 --> 06:11.420
They're going to be rapidly replaced by solar and wind primarily.

06:11.420 --> 06:16.420
And that climate impact, the climate impact of fossil fuels, is going to be increasingly

06:16.420 --> 06:17.420
catastrophic.

06:17.420 --> 06:22.780
So we're going to see more and more suffering and death from climate-related disasters.

06:22.780 --> 06:27.540
And in the book, I talk about that's not going to happen because, one, fossil fuels

06:27.540 --> 06:32.660
will remain uniquely cost-effective, particularly in a world that needs far more energy, which

06:32.660 --> 06:36.380
is something that was not stressed in the past and is not stressed enough today.

06:36.380 --> 06:39.220
People are starting to realize most of the world doesn't have enough energy.

06:39.220 --> 06:43.980
So replacing fossil fuels is almost impossible, given that you're not talking about just replacing

06:43.980 --> 06:47.220
it for the people who use it, but for the people who need it.

06:47.220 --> 06:52.160
So I've been very vindicated on the continuing cost effectiveness of fossil fuels.

06:52.160 --> 06:56.940
And then on the climate disaster point, we have documented that climate-related disaster

06:56.940 --> 07:02.020
deaths are down 98% in the last 100 years, and they've continued to decline.

07:02.380 --> 07:07.740
And the basic reason is because whatever impact we have on climate that is negative, it is

07:07.740 --> 07:13.460
far outweighed by our ability to master climate, to neutralize all sorts of climate dangers.

07:13.460 --> 07:18.740
And so we're much better off overall climate-wise than we were 50 years ago and certainly 100

07:18.740 --> 07:19.740
years ago.

07:19.740 --> 07:24.340
So with regards to, let's start with the second one there, the climate disaster.

07:24.340 --> 07:30.020
So the biophilic types, and so those would be people like Erlich, they seem to make the

07:30.020 --> 07:36.780
case that metrics that involve human flourishing or even human death aren't relevant, because

07:36.780 --> 07:42.580
the primary issue is to restore the biosphere to something approximating what it hypothetically

07:42.580 --> 07:48.260
was before there were human beings, which is a rather strange notion, all things considered.

07:48.260 --> 07:53.980
And so they might object to the fact that you're using the mere decrease in number of

07:53.980 --> 08:00.780
deaths associated with climate trouble with weather events as a metric, because the metric

08:00.780 --> 08:03.740
should be something like the purity of the planet.

08:03.740 --> 08:08.020
And so what do you think about that argument?

08:08.020 --> 08:12.700
What metric should we be using to determine whether or not a climate emergency actually

08:12.700 --> 08:13.700
exists?

08:13.700 --> 08:19.420
Well, I definitely think we should be using a human flourishing metric, but in a broad

08:19.420 --> 08:23.500
sense, the climate disaster deaths are not the only aspect of that, but they're a very

08:23.500 --> 08:24.500
important aspect.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.780
We can also see that damages are flat or down.

08:27.780 --> 08:30.560
We can see that life overall is much better.

08:30.560 --> 08:35.220
And actually our ability to preserve the most valuable parts of nature is better.

08:35.220 --> 08:39.380
Generally when you're not dependent on the land and dependent on wood, dependent on your

08:39.380 --> 08:45.020
local environment for your fuel and your wealthy, you can be much better at preserving the parts

08:45.020 --> 08:46.260
of nature that you want to preserve.

08:46.260 --> 08:50.820
If you look at places in Africa and Asia and even now Europe, because they're now energy

08:50.820 --> 08:54.540
poor, like cutting down their forests, it's because they don't have better sources of

08:54.540 --> 08:55.540
fuel.

08:55.540 --> 09:01.140
So, but I would challenge the idea that Erlich is really using this.

09:01.140 --> 09:06.460
I think you called it biophilic standard, because if you look at his public rhetoric,

09:06.460 --> 09:09.380
he's always appealing to a human flourishing standard.

09:09.380 --> 09:11.220
So how did Erlich become famous?

09:11.220 --> 09:16.180
He became famous through the 1968 book, The Population Bomb, where he's telling human

09:16.180 --> 09:21.220
beings not, hey, the planet is going to become more impacted and that's intrinsically bad.

09:21.220 --> 09:23.100
He's saying you're all going to starve.

09:23.100 --> 09:28.060
And his close colleague, Sean Holdren, who was Obama's chief science advisor, now he

09:28.060 --> 09:32.060
predicted in the 80s that we'd have up to a billion climate related disaster deaths

09:32.060 --> 09:37.060
from famine by 2020, which has come and gone and the world is better fed than ever.

09:37.060 --> 09:43.380
So what I find is that people who I think internally, they don't really care about human

09:43.380 --> 09:48.380
flourishing and they're really optimizing for eliminating our impact as much as possible,

09:48.380 --> 09:51.820
but they appeal to human flourishing to win over converts.

09:51.820 --> 09:55.780
Because if they really said the best possible earth is the one that would exist had we never

09:55.780 --> 10:01.940
existed and our goal is to eliminate as much human impact as possible as an end in itself,

10:01.940 --> 10:04.060
they would not win many converts.

10:04.060 --> 10:08.860
Well, the lack of a red wave during the midterms leads to more reckless spending by a more

10:08.860 --> 10:12.980
emboldened administration, higher taxes, deeper inflation.

10:12.980 --> 10:17.500
If you're unsure how the next two years will unfold, talk to Birch Gold Group about protecting

10:17.500 --> 10:19.380
your savings with gold.

10:19.380 --> 10:24.820
Birch Gold makes it easy to convert your IRA or 401K into an IRA in precious metals so

10:24.820 --> 10:28.660
you can own gold and silver in a tax-sheltered account.

10:28.660 --> 10:31.420
Gold is the world's oldest, most proven form of currency.

10:31.420 --> 10:36.100
When inflation soars and all other assets go sideways, gold is still there.

10:36.100 --> 10:40.660
This month, you can get a free gold back with every $5,000 purchase when you convert an

10:40.660 --> 10:46.980
existing IRA or 401K into a precious metals IRA with Birch Gold by December 22.

10:46.980 --> 10:50.420
Just text Jordan to 98998.

10:50.420 --> 10:54.500
Birch Gold will help you own gold and silver in a tax-sheltered account.

10:54.500 --> 10:58.980
Text Jordan to 98998 to claim your free info kit on gold.

10:58.980 --> 11:01.500
Then talk to one of their precious metals specialists.

11:01.500 --> 11:05.980
With every purchase you make before December 22, you'll get a free gold back.

11:05.980 --> 11:09.540
This is a great stocking stuffer just in time for Christmas.

11:09.580 --> 11:14.300
Text Jordan to 98998 and protect yourself with gold today.

11:16.460 --> 11:21.900
Okay, so the case that you're making in some sense is that the argument on the radical

11:21.900 --> 11:29.620
pro-environmental side actually varies sometimes, so to speak, in secret or behind the scenes,

11:29.620 --> 11:31.700
sort of voce, I suppose.

11:31.700 --> 11:33.900
The argument is made that the planet would be better off.

11:33.900 --> 11:38.580
It was returned to some natural and unspoiled condition.

11:38.620 --> 11:44.100
But then public-facing, the arguments are essentially predicated on the argument that

11:44.100 --> 11:48.460
if we don't do something drastic about, let's say, climate change, we're going to cause

11:48.460 --> 11:51.580
a radical increase in actual human suffering.

11:51.580 --> 11:56.820
Okay, so that all has to be straightened out conceptually before we, as a species, let's

11:56.820 --> 11:59.380
say, can move forward intelligently on this front.

11:59.380 --> 12:04.620
I think the most powerful point you made, however, and I think this is where the rubber

12:04.620 --> 12:10.460
really hits the road in more modern times, is that even if you use the metrics that are

12:10.460 --> 12:15.900
put forward by those who, let's say, oppose the continuing use of fossil fuel, so those

12:15.900 --> 12:22.220
would be metrics associated with climate change remediation and environmental improvement,

12:22.220 --> 12:28.260
the policies that are designed to drive energy costs upward do nothing at all that isn't

12:28.260 --> 12:32.180
counterproductive by their own measurements.

12:32.220 --> 12:35.420
So you pointed out, for example, and this is something that people really need to be

12:35.420 --> 12:42.260
alerted to, is that because Europe has taken this absolutely foolish route to reliance

12:42.260 --> 12:50.100
on wind and solar, which is intermittent at best, one of the things that's happening because

12:50.100 --> 12:55.860
of the pressure on liquid natural gas supplies primarily is that there's a tremendous amount

12:55.860 --> 13:01.620
of deforestation occurring in Europe at the moment because people have to turn to sources

13:01.620 --> 13:06.300
of energy that are actually at hand so that they don't freeze in the dark in the middle

13:06.300 --> 13:07.380
of the winter.

13:07.380 --> 13:11.140
And so the thing that I find so appalling about what's happening on the environmental

13:11.140 --> 13:16.820
front at the moment is that even by the metrics of the people who are pro-environmental, these

13:16.820 --> 13:21.780
policies that are driving energy costs upward are utterly counterproductive.

13:21.780 --> 13:27.820
And you know, humanprogress.org has a lovely graph showing the relationship between attention

13:27.820 --> 13:35.020
paid to true medium to long-term environmental sustainability and overall wealth.

13:35.020 --> 13:40.820
And what you see is that if you can get, as you make people wealthier, so as you remove

13:40.820 --> 13:48.860
them from absolute poverty, their ability and willingness to attend to longer-term environmental

13:48.860 --> 13:51.540
issue starts to increase rather than decreasing.

13:51.540 --> 13:55.460
And so this has struck me for, I've known this for at least 10 years, that the best

13:55.460 --> 14:01.820
pathway forward to a truly sustainable planet, even by the definitions of the environmentalists

14:01.820 --> 14:07.100
themselves, is to drive energy costs downward to the point where we can remediate absolute

14:07.100 --> 14:15.940
poverty so that people aren't driven to use up damaging and polluting immediately available

14:15.940 --> 14:19.740
bioresources instead of turning to more efficient sources of energy.

14:19.740 --> 14:24.340
And you are certainly making that case in the 2014 book, which as you pointed out, you've

14:24.340 --> 14:27.300
updated.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.840
So that's the critical issue, right?

14:28.840 --> 14:33.860
Even by the metrics of the environmentalists themselves, the policies that we're presently

14:33.860 --> 14:40.300
pursuing on the energy front are not only counterproductive environmentally, but they're driving poor people

14:40.300 --> 14:41.300
into abject poverty.

14:41.300 --> 14:45.180
We're going to see a lot of that in Europe.

14:45.180 --> 14:46.840
I think it depends.

14:46.840 --> 14:53.500
So I think if you take the quote environmentalists as having a kind of pro-human interest in

14:53.500 --> 14:58.100
nature and pro-human interest in lack of pollution, this is true.

14:58.100 --> 15:03.940
But my belief is that the core of it is the belief that human impact is inherently bad,

15:03.940 --> 15:08.340
it's intrinsically immoral, and also the belief is it's inevitably self-destructive.

15:08.340 --> 15:13.100
So nature is viewed as this God, that if we offend it through our impact, is going to

15:13.100 --> 15:14.100
punish us.

15:14.100 --> 15:17.660
And it really has this character where it's wrong, and doing the wrong thing is going

15:17.660 --> 15:19.060
to destroy us.

15:19.180 --> 15:24.420
And if you really think about it that way, all their policies make sense because their

15:24.420 --> 15:30.300
policies are really aimed at making human life worse and ultimately reducing the human

15:30.300 --> 15:31.300
population.

15:31.300 --> 15:32.300
So it is true.

15:32.300 --> 15:34.540
You can say, well, yeah, aren't you cutting down more trees?

15:34.540 --> 15:35.900
Aren't you doing this?

15:35.900 --> 15:40.620
But they would say, well, let's say we had cheap, free nuclear energy, which they've

15:40.620 --> 15:43.940
actually commented on hypothetically when they thought fusion was possible.

15:43.940 --> 15:47.460
I talk about this in moral case and in fossil future.

15:47.460 --> 15:50.380
The leading environmentalist said this would be the worst thing ever.

15:50.380 --> 15:55.100
A totally clean, cheap, abundant source of energy would be the worst thing ever because

15:55.100 --> 15:56.980
of what we would do with it.

15:56.980 --> 16:01.820
And one of the leaders called it giving an idiot child a machine gun.

16:01.820 --> 16:06.620
And what they recognized is that energy is really our ability to do work, which means

16:06.620 --> 16:08.540
our ability to impact the earth.

16:08.540 --> 16:11.620
And when we use a lot of energy, we impact the earth a lot.

16:11.620 --> 16:16.240
Now we impact it in a way that's beneficial to us, including we preserve the most valuable

16:16.240 --> 16:20.120
parts of nature, and we give ourselves an ability to enjoy nature.

16:20.120 --> 16:23.240
Nevertheless, it is a very humanized earth.

16:23.240 --> 16:27.740
And to the anti-human environmental movement, that is offensive.

16:27.740 --> 16:31.840
So that movement is not about a clean environment for us or for us to be able to contemplate

16:31.840 --> 16:35.520
polar bears or go on safaris or any of this.

16:35.520 --> 16:37.400
It's about a dehumanized earth.

16:37.400 --> 16:41.200
It's the belief that we are uniquely bad and we need to get eliminated.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.200
Right, right.

16:42.440 --> 16:46.760
But the problem with that argument, even if you attempt to give the devil his due, let's

16:46.760 --> 16:53.640
say, is that it's predicated on the idea that if we pursued policies to decrease our overall

16:53.640 --> 17:00.480
energy use, and if one of the consequences of those policies was the relatively radical

17:00.480 --> 17:08.120
depopulation of the earth, perhaps by radically lowering birth rates, that while that transformation

17:08.120 --> 17:15.000
was occurring, depopulation and deindustrialization, things would remain stable enough so that

17:15.000 --> 17:19.480
in our new poverty and our hopelessness with regards to the future, we wouldn't be devouring

17:19.480 --> 17:21.280
the planet while we were dying.

17:21.280 --> 17:23.560
And I think that's a preposterous claim.

17:23.560 --> 17:30.860
I don't see any peaceful way forward that's based on compulsion and poverty to reduce

17:30.860 --> 17:35.280
the population of the world that isn't going to be absolutely destructive on the energy,

17:35.280 --> 17:39.160
on the environment, on the environment front.

17:39.160 --> 17:44.240
And the idea that if we had more energy, we would actually be worse for the planet, flies

17:44.240 --> 17:49.040
in the face of what we've been discussing already, which is the fact that if people can't

17:49.040 --> 17:54.640
turn to cheap and efficient and relatively clean sources of energy, and perhaps liquid

17:54.640 --> 18:00.480
natural gas and nuclear would be at the top of that list, then they're going to absolutely

18:00.480 --> 18:06.720
100% turn to much dirtier replacements, and we've already seen that happening in, well,

18:06.720 --> 18:07.720
everywhere.

18:07.720 --> 18:12.760
China is building coal-fired plants at a rate that's so rapid that everything the West

18:12.760 --> 18:17.160
is doing on the climate amelioration front is absolutely irrelevant.

18:17.160 --> 18:22.720
And what has the UK in the last week has already pledged to double its coal imports, and Germany

18:22.720 --> 18:28.680
has had to turn to its coal-fired plants to provide backup power because wind and solar

18:28.800 --> 18:35.000
has proved not only hyperexpensive, but so unreliable that, well, that when there's no

18:35.000 --> 18:39.440
power, so when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing, you have to have backup,

18:39.440 --> 18:45.720
and it's been coal that's been brought in as a stopgap.

18:45.720 --> 18:52.000
So I just can't see any way, even if you accept the arguments that you just laid forward,

18:52.000 --> 18:55.840
that there should be fewer people and that the right planet is one that's characterized

18:55.840 --> 19:02.000
by minimal human action, I can't see any way forward to that on the energy poverty front

19:02.000 --> 19:05.280
that's not going to be positively counterproductive.

19:05.280 --> 19:12.080
I agree with you in terms of how it plays out, and I think it's important in general

19:12.080 --> 19:16.560
this is not a scientific movement, and part of it not being a scientific movement is

19:16.560 --> 19:22.400
it doesn't really have a long-term strategy for achieving its anti-human goals.

19:23.120 --> 19:29.920
It has a lot of ritual in it, there's a lot of just hostility toward anything that has impact,

19:29.920 --> 19:33.520
and you just oppose that, and then you assume things are going to get better.

19:33.520 --> 19:37.760
And so people didn't think through what's going to happen when you make energy more expensive,

19:37.760 --> 19:40.720
what's going to happen to the forest? They didn't think that through at all,

19:40.720 --> 19:45.520
or when you oppose nuclear, what are you going to use in its stead? Or when you make energy

19:45.520 --> 19:49.840
expensive, what's going to happen in terms of rights? It's not at all thought through,

19:49.840 --> 19:54.000
and I think this might be a lesson for us to have when we contemplate these so-called plans

19:54.000 --> 19:59.200
for net zero. This is a movement that's very much, it has this hostility toward human impact,

19:59.200 --> 20:04.160
it opposes it wherever it sees it, and it just, it has a quality of nihilism to it.

20:04.160 --> 20:08.080
And it's not thinking through, it's not thinking through either a dehumanized earth

20:08.080 --> 20:13.680
or a human-friendly earth. It's sort of going after anything that has impact, but my argument is

20:13.680 --> 20:19.040
we need to switch our hostility toward impact. This view that human impact is bad

20:19.040 --> 20:24.560
needs to be challenged. Human impact is good if it makes the earth a better place for human flourishing.

20:26.080 --> 20:30.400
The biggest banks and investment firms in the world are putting up to half of their total assets

20:30.400 --> 20:35.920
into new investments. What do they know that we don't? Maybe that the economy is about to get

20:35.920 --> 20:42.160
worse? The CEO of JP Morgan just warned that stocks could slide another 20%. Bigwigs are

20:42.160 --> 20:47.280
moving their money into alternatives like fine art, because fine art has outpaced even the S&P

20:47.280 --> 20:55.360
500 over the last 26 years by 131%. Even in 2022, Masterworks produced results. In early

20:55.360 --> 21:01.360
November, Masterworks had a strategic exit for a 17.8% net return to their investors.

21:01.360 --> 21:07.920
Their last three exits have brought in 17, 21, and 33% net returns. The next six months could

21:07.920 --> 21:12.560
be some of the most important of your investing life. Paintings are selling out in minutes,

21:37.360 --> 21:43.680
because one of the things I wonder about is why this idea that human beings are in some sense

21:44.240 --> 21:52.880
in their activity antagonistic to the earth. It's a very peculiar metaphysical assumption,

21:52.880 --> 21:57.920
especially for people who are hypothetically, biologically minded, because if we're living

21:57.920 --> 22:02.960
creatures, which we clearly are, and if we've evolved in the same manner that other living

22:02.960 --> 22:08.640
creatures have evolved, which seems relatively indisputable, then how is it that our very

22:08.640 --> 22:14.240
existence is somehow antithetical to the flourishing of the biosphere, given that we're clearly part

22:14.240 --> 22:19.440
of the biosphere? And you see this sort of thing with this idiot assumption, for example,

22:20.160 --> 22:25.120
that bears some of the same hallmarks of this kind of quasi-philosophical thinking that

22:25.120 --> 22:30.000
before the Europeans came to North America that the natives were living somehow in harmony with

22:30.000 --> 22:36.080
nature, and that the entire biosphere was free of the scars of human interaction, and

22:36.080 --> 22:41.760
that's utterly preposterous. I mean, the Native Americans were incredibly sophisticated agricultural

22:41.760 --> 22:49.360
ists, and the Western Plains Indians burned the prairies with constantly to ensure that there

22:49.360 --> 22:55.440
was a plentiful supply of the buffalo that they depended on. And so human beings have been

22:56.080 --> 23:01.120
affecting the structure of the biosphere ever since we've been around, and that's for a very

23:01.120 --> 23:06.640
long period of time. And the idea that there was somehow some pristine state of nature before

23:06.640 --> 23:12.560
we emerged on the landscape, and that there's some moral imperative to return to that,

23:13.280 --> 23:17.920
it strikes me, it's so incoherent that it's barely comprehensible. And there is something like a

23:17.920 --> 23:22.720
hatred for humanity, as far as I can tell that's lurking underneath this, hatred for humanity,

23:22.720 --> 23:26.880
certainly a hatred for industrialization. And those actually turn out to be the same thing.

23:26.880 --> 23:33.520
I mean, one of the things that's really struck me as incomprehensible over the last few years is that,

23:33.520 --> 23:39.920
especially on the left, is that you have these joint claims being put forward simultaneously

23:39.920 --> 23:45.840
on the left, and one is that we're radically pro-environmental, and we're also the

23:46.800 --> 23:52.480
philosophical doctrine that is standing up for the poor and oppressed. And I think, okay, well,

23:52.480 --> 23:57.200
what happens when those two things are pitted against each other? And when are they pitted?

23:57.200 --> 24:02.240
Well, they're pitted when it comes to discussions about cheap energy, because it's clearly the case,

24:02.240 --> 24:08.800
and you outline this in your book quite nicely, that the most effective way of remediating absolute

24:08.800 --> 24:16.000
poverty, so lifting people out of the privation that's associated, at least with lack of education,

24:16.000 --> 24:22.960
but also with starvation itself, is to provide them with cheap energy, because as you pointed

24:22.960 --> 24:27.120
out, there's no difference between energy and work, and there's no difference between work and

24:27.120 --> 24:33.520
productivity. There's no difference between productivity and the eradication of poverty.

24:33.520 --> 24:39.520
And so we are pursuing these expensive energy policies, and hypothetically, we're supposed

24:39.520 --> 24:45.520
to benefit the planet, although we're not, but we are definitely dooming people who are already poor

24:45.520 --> 24:52.240
to a much more truncated horizon of opportunity, and to absolute privation and starvation in many

24:52.240 --> 24:56.960
cases. Yes, I think it's really... I mean, there are at least two really interesting issues raised

24:56.960 --> 25:02.480
here, sort of this tension between the alleged concern for poverty and then the quote concern for

25:02.480 --> 25:08.560
the environment, and then this question of how this bizarre view evolved, because this was not

25:08.560 --> 25:13.200
the view of our environment and our impact 100 years ago. And interestingly, it's not the view

25:13.200 --> 25:17.200
of our environment that anyone who lives near nature has. People who live in nature don't worship

25:17.200 --> 25:22.880
nature as the superior God that can't be impacted. And I think it's my own understanding of the

25:22.880 --> 25:28.960
history, and I really enjoy... There's a book by Einran called The New Left, The Anti-Industrial

25:28.960 --> 25:34.080
Revolution, and it was written at the time that this was happening. And one of the analyses is

25:34.080 --> 25:38.800
basically there's a transition between the old left and the new left, where the old left claimed

25:38.800 --> 25:44.720
to be for industry, for productivity, for prosperity. And what happened is that was clearly

25:44.720 --> 25:49.600
not achieved by their policies. Communism led to the devastation of industry, the malfunction of

25:49.600 --> 25:54.880
industry, widespread poverty. And Einran said, well, the left basically had a choice. Are you

25:54.880 --> 26:00.000
going to stay with your anti-capitalism, or are you going to embrace capitalism because you really

26:00.000 --> 26:05.280
care about industry and productivity? And actually, what they did was they kept their

26:05.280 --> 26:10.960
anti-capitalism, and they looked for new reasons to support anti-capitalism. And in the 60s,

26:10.960 --> 26:16.240
they decided on this issue of environment. And it was a convenient issue in a number of ways.

26:16.240 --> 26:20.960
One is the pro-capitalism side didn't do a very good job with it, particularly rhetorically.

26:20.960 --> 26:25.360
They didn't make the point that, well, good environments are made possible by prosperity.

26:25.360 --> 26:31.040
So the idea of a good environment in a humanistic way was co-opted by the anti-capitalist who had

26:31.040 --> 26:36.560
no right to it whatsoever. I mean, look at the Soviet Union and an environment, but they owned

26:36.560 --> 26:43.200
that value issue. But then they packaged it with this hostility toward human impact as such. And

26:43.200 --> 26:47.840
what they really did brilliantly was they took over the schools. So in the schools, this idea

26:47.840 --> 26:53.600
that human impact is bad, and especially the idea that it's inevitably self-destructive because the

26:53.600 --> 26:58.880
planet is this delicate nurture that our impact ruins. And that has permeated the whole educational

26:58.880 --> 27:03.600
system where people think that we inherently are destroyers of the planet, and it has permeated

27:03.600 --> 27:08.880
the scientific community. What I call this delicate nurture dogma is unfortunately pervasive

27:08.880 --> 27:14.480
in earth sciences today. It's a very primitive and bizarre view. It has nothing to do with reality

27:14.480 --> 27:19.280
that our impact is inevitably self-destructive. Actually, our impact has made the earth much

27:19.280 --> 27:24.160
better overall, including safer from climate. But nevertheless, I think it's really, there was

27:24.160 --> 27:29.200
initially a real political motivation to spread this. But now we have this irrationalist philosophy

27:29.200 --> 27:33.760
that has a mind of its own. Yeah, well, that's okay. So let's delve into that a little bit,

27:33.760 --> 27:38.960
because the other thing that I've come to understand more clearly in the last 15 years,

27:38.960 --> 27:42.160
let's say, as the data has also become more clear is that,

27:44.240 --> 27:49.360
so we lifted more people out of poverty in absolute terms, and also in relative terms,

27:49.360 --> 27:56.640
between 2000 and 2015, than we had lifted people out of poverty in the sum total of human endeavor

27:56.640 --> 28:05.920
before that. And it's quite clear that the reason for that was that fewer countries pursued absolutely

28:05.920 --> 28:11.360
counterproductive economic policies of the type that were put forward, let's say, by the

28:11.360 --> 28:17.760
communists when the Cold War was raging. And so you saw all over the world, including in places like

28:18.880 --> 28:26.720
Communist China, that there was a radical move towards something approximating free market and

28:26.720 --> 28:31.120
free trade between individuals. And in some countries, that was implemented more effectively

28:31.120 --> 28:37.280
than others. But wherever it was implemented, at least quasi effectively, people immediately

28:37.280 --> 28:44.160
stopped starving. And so, and I'm trying to make a case in relationship to the anti-capitalism,

28:44.160 --> 28:50.320
so let's say that you are a genuine classic leftist, and you are actually concerned with the poor,

28:50.320 --> 28:55.280
especially remediation of absolute poverty, and you're looking at the data, and you see that

28:55.280 --> 29:01.040
after the Soviet Union collapsed, and there were fewer countries turning to communist dogma to

29:01.200 --> 29:06.400
formulate their economic policies, and more countries started to develop, started to participate

29:06.400 --> 29:12.880
in the broad free market, that we drove poverty down to its lowest level in absolute numbers,

29:12.880 --> 29:17.680
or in relative numbers, certainly, than we'd ever seen before in history. And so then again,

29:17.680 --> 29:26.960
we're back to the same issue. If the spread of free market policies remediates absolute poverty,

29:27.040 --> 29:34.640
which it clearly does, and in a staggeringly rapid manner, then what in the world is driving

29:35.200 --> 29:42.000
the anti-capitalist ethos? You know, you said that there's this underlying metaphor of nature as

29:42.000 --> 29:48.800
something like fragile virgin, right, continually what rendered susceptible to our raping and

29:48.800 --> 29:54.960
pillaging. So there's a weird metaphor lurking at the bottom of all that, but given the overwhelming

29:54.960 --> 30:01.920
data that something approximating free market frees people from absolute poverty, and then

30:01.920 --> 30:06.720
conjoining that with the observation that richer people actually care more about the environment,

30:06.720 --> 30:11.600
you're left again with this question of what in the world is motivating this. There's some deep

30:11.600 --> 30:17.600
hatred. It's like a deep hatred for humanity itself, but even at the expense of the planet.

30:17.600 --> 30:23.040
And so I still struggle with trying to comprehend that. There's a kind of existential guilt there

30:23.600 --> 30:27.040
for the crime of existence itself. It's something like that.

30:28.000 --> 30:34.640
I mean, I think there's one really powerful fact about the increase in prosperity that I draw

30:34.640 --> 30:38.720
attention to a lot in fossil future, because I think it's very notable. So I point out, I was born

30:38.720 --> 30:44.400
in 1980. Since 1980, we've gone from more than four in 10 people living on less than $2 a day,

30:44.400 --> 30:49.040
and this is adjusted for inflation, to one in 10. So as you said, this is the greatest alleviation of

30:49.040 --> 30:54.720
poverty in human history. Now, what's really interesting is if you survey, and this was done

30:54.720 --> 30:58.800
in the UK, you might have seen this before, but there's a survey of college-educated adults in

30:58.800 --> 31:04.640
the UK about what has happened to extreme poverty over the past 30 or 40 years. And this is just

31:05.200 --> 31:10.880
an objective documented thing. There's no question. And so what happened is only 12% of people

31:10.880 --> 31:18.880
thought it got better. 55% of people thought it got worse, and the rest thought it stayed

31:18.880 --> 31:24.640
the same. And it just shows you the level of miseducation about this issue. And I do think

31:24.640 --> 31:29.840
a lot of it is the modern anti-human environmental movement, because what they've done is they've

31:29.840 --> 31:34.880
taught us that our impact ruins the planet. And so we just assume that because the world used

31:34.880 --> 31:40.320
a lot more fossil fuels, particularly China and India did, which drove much of the increase

31:40.320 --> 31:45.200
in prosperity, they just assume that the world is worse. And what I call, I don't use this term

31:45.200 --> 31:49.840
in a moral case, but I use it in fossil future, our knowledge system. So the institutions we

31:49.840 --> 31:57.680
rely on for expert knowledge and guidance, they've totally failed at educating us about how much

31:57.680 --> 32:02.400
the world has improved from a human perspective. And this goes back to my argument that the

32:02.400 --> 32:07.520
anti-human environmental movement, they're trying to pretend to be pro-human. So they don't want us

32:07.520 --> 32:11.920
to know that the earth is a much better place than ever to live. They don't want us to know

32:11.920 --> 32:16.160
that climate disaster deaths are way down. They don't want us to know about the decline in extreme

32:16.160 --> 32:21.040
poverty, because it totally challenges their narrative that impact in general and fossil

32:21.040 --> 32:26.560
fuels in particular are bad. And if we recognized how vital fossil fuels are, then we would be

32:26.560 --> 32:32.160
really afraid of these proposals to get rid of fossil fuels in the next 27 years in a world

32:32.160 --> 32:36.880
that needs far more energy. And unfortunately, we're starting to realize this involuntarily

32:36.880 --> 32:41.760
because these policies just implemented one percent, these anti-fossil fuel policies,

32:41.760 --> 32:46.160
just implemented to one percent success rate in the anti-fossil fuel movement's view

32:46.160 --> 32:51.440
have already led to a global energy crisis. Do you have a coffee lover on your holiday

33:50.880 --> 33:59.440
Right, right. Well, you knew said that the planet is getting better, let's say,

33:59.440 --> 34:04.960
from a human perspective. And so we've looked at metrics like the radical decrease in absolute

34:04.960 --> 34:10.800
privation. But we could turn our attention momentarily to the evidence that in many ways,

34:10.800 --> 34:15.360
and somewhat paradoxically and perversely, the planet actually seems to be doing better

34:15.360 --> 34:22.880
from the natural perspective too. Now, I have been concerned about, I have believed for a long

34:22.880 --> 34:28.640
time that one of our focal concerns might be on the environmental front might appropriately be

34:28.640 --> 34:34.560
something like remediation of misuse of oceanic resources, because I think we've done a pretty

34:34.560 --> 34:45.040
cataclysmic job of protecting our, especially our coastal lands and the shelf environments

34:45.120 --> 34:49.200
just off shore of the continents, where pretty much all the fish are. I think we've done a

34:49.200 --> 34:55.760
catastrophic job of managing that. And there are genuine environmental problems that I think

34:55.760 --> 35:00.320
sensible people should take into account. But, you know, I was looking at a graph this week,

35:00.320 --> 35:04.400
and I've known about this phenomenon for quite a while, phenomenon for quite a while,

35:05.360 --> 35:13.680
that again, in the last 15 years, a surface area totaling 15% of the entire planet has

35:13.680 --> 35:19.280
greened. I mean, that is, that's an area that's larger than the continental United States,

35:19.280 --> 35:23.360
and it's, so let's, let's walk through that for a minute, so just so everyone who's listening

35:23.360 --> 35:30.400
is clear. In the last 15 years, the planet has not got less green, it's got more green, and not

35:30.400 --> 35:37.920
only a little bit more green, stunningly more green, 15% in, essentially in 15 years, and that's an

35:37.920 --> 35:42.160
area bigger than the continental United States, and that's happened pretty much everywhere in the

35:42.160 --> 35:47.920
world. And then you might say, well, where is that happening? And perversely, and contrary to all

35:47.920 --> 35:53.920
predictions, it's happening in the drier areas of the planet, especially in semi-arid areas,

35:53.920 --> 36:02.080
and here's the reason. So plants have to breathe, and to breathe, they have to open pores on their

36:02.080 --> 36:08.320
surface, and the problem for plants when they breathe with these pores is that they also allow

36:08.320 --> 36:14.640
water to evaporate from their internal structures, and so the less carbon dioxide in the air, the

36:14.640 --> 36:19.200
more the plants have to open their pores, and that means the more susceptible they are to drying out,

36:19.200 --> 36:24.800
and that means that they struggle to exist in semi-arid areas. Now, what's happened as a consequence

36:24.800 --> 36:29.680
of increased carbon dioxide production is that plants can breathe easier, and so they don't have

36:29.680 --> 36:35.200
to open their pores to the same degree, and what's that, what that has meant is that the very desert

36:35.200 --> 36:41.840
areas, at least the semi-arid areas, that the climate apocalypse were claiming would

36:41.840 --> 36:48.160
expand and spread, so the desertification of the world, the exact opposite has happened,

36:48.160 --> 36:53.200
and the Sahara Desert, for example, has shrunk to quite a stunning degree, and not only is the

36:53.200 --> 37:00.400
planet 15% greener than it was in 2000, but there are more trees in the northern hemisphere

37:00.400 --> 37:07.760
than there were a hundred years ago, and as well as the planet greening, and so you can think about

37:07.760 --> 37:13.920
that as a victory on the objective front for the natural world, at the same time the planet is green,

37:13.920 --> 37:18.400
because it's easier for plants to survive, our food crops have become much more productive

37:19.200 --> 37:24.960
for exactly the same reasons, and so as carbon dioxide output has increased, the planet has got,

37:24.960 --> 37:30.480
not only has the planet got greener, it's got greener in the driest areas, which is absolutely

37:30.480 --> 37:37.600
stunning and remarkable, and one of the consequences of that increased greening is that our agriculture

37:37.600 --> 37:43.200
production has become not less efficient, but much more efficient, and so I'm really wrestling with

37:43.200 --> 37:47.840
how to conceptualize that particular sense of statistics. I just thought of an idea, I just

37:47.840 --> 37:51.360
thought of an idea, I've never thought of this before, so we're just trying it right now, but I

37:51.680 --> 37:56.160
think maybe we can think of three conceptions of the earth which capture everything we're talking

37:56.160 --> 38:01.520
about, so my primary conception is evaluating the earth from the perspective of human flourishing,

38:01.520 --> 38:07.040
how hospitable to human beings is it, and this includes like a lush green beautiful world for

38:07.040 --> 38:11.920
us to enjoy for many reasons you've talked about, but then the second one could be looking at the

38:11.920 --> 38:18.320
earth in terms of just pure biological productivity, so just not even focusing on humans, just how much

38:18.320 --> 38:24.000
life is on the planet, and this captures what you just mentioned with rising CO2 levels,

38:24.000 --> 38:28.800
making a greener planet, but then the third one, and I think this is really the core of the modern

38:28.800 --> 38:35.440
environmental movement, is an unimpacted planet, so you're not optimizing for biological productivity,

38:35.440 --> 38:40.240
you're optimizing for minimal impact, and I think that is really the core of the modern

38:40.240 --> 38:45.440
environmental movement, it's not this just blanket collective desire for as much life as possible,

38:45.440 --> 38:49.200
and we're somehow getting in the way of that, it's specifically against us, and I think you

38:49.200 --> 38:55.280
brought up the perfect example, which is the climate catastrophe movements total non-interest

38:55.280 --> 39:02.080
in kind of the obvious biological productivity benefits of more CO2, and this was not shocking

39:02.080 --> 39:06.800
or stunning, this is exactly what was predicted by the people who discovered the greenhouse effect,

39:06.800 --> 39:11.600
when they discovered the greenhouse effect they said this is going to on its own make the earth a

39:11.680 --> 39:18.000
much more lush place, they speculated like the fruits are going to be bigger and everything

39:18.000 --> 39:22.080
is going to be lush because we're going to have more farmland and more biological, and it's kind

39:22.080 --> 39:28.560
of obvious, if you have a warmer world with more CO2, it's a more tropical world with more life,

39:28.560 --> 39:33.600
it's a more green world in the life sense of green, and yet the green movement hates it

39:33.600 --> 39:39.920
because we caused it, so they can see no good in anything we caused, even when it leads to more

39:39.920 --> 39:43.600
biological productivity, so I think what you're bringing up really shows it's fundamentally an

39:43.600 --> 39:49.760
anti-human movement, not a pro-life of any kind. Right, right, okay, but let's let's talk about

39:49.760 --> 39:57.920
that idea of impact, it's like well what is this hypothetical perfect world that exists statically

39:58.560 --> 40:04.880
that would be pristine and morally valuable in the absence of human beings, I mean the biosphere

40:04.880 --> 40:11.360
is a dynamic place obviously over any timescale and there's shift in what constitutes quote the

40:11.360 --> 40:17.360
environment, there seems to be this presumption that at some point in the past when there was

40:17.360 --> 40:24.000
minimal human activity the earth was somehow optimized in the biological but also the moral

40:24.000 --> 40:30.480
sense and that any change in that whatsoever in any direction, hence climate change let's say rather

40:30.480 --> 40:37.280
than global warming, any change in that whatsoever is to be regarded axiomatically as evil, but what

40:37.280 --> 40:43.440
that essentially means as far as I can tell the ineluctible conclusion that has to be drawn from

40:43.440 --> 40:50.960
that proposition is that any human activity whatsoever is to be regarded as evil on the

40:50.960 --> 40:55.920
face of it, it doesn't matter what it does, and your point is that even if it increases bio,

40:56.880 --> 41:01.760
even if it increases total biological flourishing in terms of like let's say the

41:01.760 --> 41:08.880
net metric tonnage of biological life on the planet and so that's also perverse because that is

41:08.880 --> 41:16.320
definitely a game that none of us can win, if the a prior rule is no matter what you do you're evil

41:16.320 --> 41:22.080
then the only solution to that is well how about a hell of a lot fewer of you, but then you say well

41:22.080 --> 41:27.280
what's that supposed to serve because if what we're doing now is actually making the planet more

41:27.280 --> 41:32.560
green and I'm saying that very carefully because I know that that's not a sufficient metric, I am

41:32.560 --> 41:39.440
very concerned with issues let's say or conscious of issues that are relevant like the potential loss

41:39.440 --> 41:48.560
of biodiversity and also the overfishing of the oceans let's say, so even though the planet is

41:48.560 --> 41:53.440
becoming greener that doesn't mean that there are no mistakes we're making on the environmental

41:53.440 --> 41:58.560
front, but those mistakes have to be differentiated out and they're all addressable and you know as

41:58.560 --> 42:03.680
we get richer too and we can do more with less and our agriculture becomes more efficient if we can

42:03.680 --> 42:09.520
manage that, that also means even by the standards of the environmentalists themselves that we'll

42:09.520 --> 42:17.120
be able to set aside reasonably large tracts of land and water to maintain them in something

42:17.120 --> 42:22.880
approximating a pristine and untouched state, I mean that's certainly something that should be done

42:22.880 --> 42:30.720
on the on the oceanic management front, I mean the data that I know suggests that if we set aside

42:30.720 --> 42:36.240
a certain percentage of the coastal area as marine protected areas and that might not be the most

42:36.240 --> 42:41.760
efficient way to manage the oceans but it's not bad that we'll reap the benefits of having

42:41.840 --> 42:49.360
untouched nature so to speak which is an aesthetic and economic and environmental good but we'll also

42:50.240 --> 42:54.160
be able to replenish the oceans in a manner that would be economically productive and so

42:54.800 --> 42:59.280
well like why can't why the hell can't we have our cake and eat it too that is we can help people

42:59.280 --> 43:06.160
become rich with the provision of of plentiful energy and then we can put aside tracts of the

43:06.160 --> 43:11.440
world so that they're relatively untouched so that biology can do its thing and like what the

43:11.440 --> 43:16.560
hell is the problem with that precisely? Well it's it's so I think you're pointing to something

43:16.560 --> 43:21.040
really good and something really bad something really good is why my my new book is called

43:21.040 --> 43:26.480
fossil future why global human flourishing requires more oil coal and natural gas not less but part

43:26.480 --> 43:31.600
of it it does talk about we can you know we can increase all of these biological things we can

43:31.600 --> 43:37.120
have a much more lush world we can enjoy nature much more this is fundamentally good news the more

43:37.120 --> 43:43.120
energy we have the more control we have over earth and the more we can make everything about it better

43:43.120 --> 43:49.040
for our purposes including aesthetic things that poor people can't possibly be confused by but the

43:49.040 --> 43:55.120
bad thing here is it's really highlighting the nihilism of this view that human impact is bad

43:55.120 --> 44:00.960
and again I really think it's the view is not that we want a lush environment and human beings are

44:00.960 --> 44:04.320
getting in the way of that we want biological productivity and human beings are getting away

44:04.320 --> 44:10.160
because as you're pointing out they are opposing all human impact including obvious things that make

44:10.160 --> 44:15.760
the world better and so it really is the view that if we did it it's bad and you ask something like

44:15.760 --> 44:21.600
what is it serving but it's a nihilistic view so it's not really serving anything even when you

44:21.600 --> 44:26.480
think when you think about unimpacted nature it's not this beautiful thing for us to enjoy

44:26.480 --> 44:31.600
it's supposed to be protected from us so that's really the view including our enjoyment of this

44:31.600 --> 44:39.040
evil of course our enjoyment is of no consequence whatsoever and in fossil future and in moral

44:39.040 --> 44:44.000
case I have a lot of quotes from the leaders where they'll occasionally let this slip out where one

44:44.000 --> 44:48.640
guy for example who was reviewing Bill McKibbin's book the end of nature talks about you know

44:48.640 --> 44:53.280
like a flourishing biosphere is more important to me more important to me than one human or a

44:53.280 --> 44:58.800
billion of them yeah yeah let me read that let me read that I've got it right here so this is

44:58.800 --> 45:04.080
something that you cite in your 2014 book I'm gonna just read it so everybody can hear it and I would

45:04.800 --> 45:10.720
I would ask everyone who's listening to really think about this because this gets to the this

45:10.720 --> 45:16.880
strikes to the core of the issue as far as I can tell so for example this is from your book

45:17.440 --> 45:21.360
in a Los Angeles Times review of the end of nature

45:23.040 --> 45:28.000
McKibbin's influential book of 25 years ago predicting catastrophic climate change

45:28.880 --> 45:35.680
David M. Graber research biologist for the National Park Service wrote this summary of

45:35.680 --> 45:46.800
McKibbin's message McKibbin is a biocentrist and so am I we are not interested in the utility

45:46.960 --> 45:55.760
of a particular species or free flowing river or ecosystem to mankind they have intrinsic value

45:56.320 --> 46:02.320
more value to me than another human being that's a very interesting thing to say

46:02.320 --> 46:07.120
or a billion of them which is also a very interesting thing to say human happiness and

46:07.120 --> 46:14.000
certainly human fecundity are not as important as a wild and healthy planet

46:14.960 --> 46:23.040
are no social scientists who remind me that people are part of nature but that isn't true

46:24.960 --> 46:31.760
somewhere along the line at about a billion years ago maybe half that we quit the contract

46:32.960 --> 46:38.400
and became a cancer we have become a plague upon ourselves and upon the earth

46:38.720 --> 46:45.840
it is cosmically unlikely that the developed world will choose to end its orgy of fossil fuel

46:45.840 --> 46:53.520
consumption and the third world its suicidal consumption of landscape until such time as

46:53.520 --> 47:03.520
Homo sapiens should decide to rejoin nature some of us can only hope for the right virus

47:04.480 --> 47:09.760
to come along you know I cannot understand how anybody who is

47:13.200 --> 47:19.600
positively predisposed to children let's might we might say could read something like that

47:19.600 --> 47:25.920
and not be absolutely shocked to their core I mean so let's walk through the claims the first claim is

47:26.240 --> 47:35.040
a an untouched natural landscape of any size whatever untouched means is more valuable in

47:35.040 --> 47:41.520
and of itself than any individual human being or any group of people no matter how large the number

47:42.480 --> 47:50.080
okay so the implication there is any number of human beings could be sacrificed in order to preserve

47:50.640 --> 47:58.960
any geographically demarcated natural zone of any size so that's a yes a standard of comparative

47:58.960 --> 48:08.640
value and then the cancer metaphor while human beings have deviated from the natural order whatever

48:08.640 --> 48:14.080
that natural order is whatever our deviation consists of and we've deviated the same way

48:14.720 --> 48:22.160
a cancer deviates so now the metaphor is human beings equal cancer and that's that's a hell of a

48:22.160 --> 48:29.120
metaphor because what we do with cancer is strive to eradicate it so these metaphors have deep

48:29.120 --> 48:34.560
motivational significance so that's a little bit on the appalling side let's say and it's grounded in

48:34.560 --> 48:40.720
a very narrow malethusian view of the world which is that we're something like yeast cancer let's say

48:40.800 --> 48:45.840
and left to our own devices will multiply unchecked until we devour everything in perish

48:45.840 --> 48:53.280
which is a pretty dismal and only vaguely biologically centered view of how human beings

48:53.280 --> 48:57.760
conduct themselves because we're not yeast in a bloody petri dish we're not yeast and the world

48:57.760 --> 49:02.720
isn't a petri dish let's put it that way and then you add to that though the closing statement which

49:02.720 --> 49:09.680
is something like those of us who are properly oriented in our moral endeavor in relationship to

49:09.680 --> 49:18.080
the non-human world can only sit and pray that the right virus comes along so that what so that

49:18.080 --> 49:25.280
we're we're radically depopulated to what to what degree down to the half a billion people that the

49:25.280 --> 49:33.840
world can hypothetically sustain it's like every single bit of that to me reeks of an underlying

49:33.840 --> 49:42.560
and barely veiled brutal genocidal impulse i agree and what i want to draw attention to is that

49:42.560 --> 49:49.840
this mentality diluted or not to various degrees is leading our thinking about what to do about

49:49.840 --> 49:55.280
fossil fuels which is an existential issue for the world because the reason i go into this

49:55.280 --> 49:59.440
particularly in fossil future is the point i'm making is that the people and institutions

49:59.440 --> 50:05.040
were trusting to evaluate what to do about this source of energy that powers the world that also

50:05.040 --> 50:11.440
emits co2 and impacts the climate those people are not making that evaluation by anything resembling

50:11.440 --> 50:16.960
the goal of advancing human flourishing on earth they are pursuing to a significant degree this

50:16.960 --> 50:22.640
goal of eliminating human impact on earth and the economist george reisman had this article

50:23.280 --> 50:28.880
a long time ago called the toxicity of environmentalism and one point he made that i never forgot

50:28.960 --> 50:34.400
is he said listening to a modern environmentalist is like listening to a doctor who's on the side

50:34.400 --> 50:40.080
of the germs somebody who doesn't have your best interests at heart and as an example

50:40.080 --> 50:45.040
one of the people i pick on very deservedly in fossil future is michael man who's a climate

50:45.040 --> 50:50.800
scientist and activist who is one of the leading advisors and if you look at michael man's statements

50:50.800 --> 50:57.040
one thing he has said is the ideal population for earth is a billion people yeah yeah how can

50:57.040 --> 51:01.600
you possibly say that there are eight billion people like how can you possibly look at earth

51:01.600 --> 51:06.400
and say oh yeah it's too many people that has a murderous impulse to it if you just look at the

51:06.400 --> 51:11.600
earth and you say oh yeah seven billion people should go and what i point out with michael man

51:11.600 --> 51:16.000
is that if you look at how he's evaluating the issue he's totally indifferent to the benefits of

51:16.000 --> 51:20.080
fossil fuels he has a whole book people can look it up called the madhouse effect about fossil

51:20.080 --> 51:24.240
fuels and climate and he doesn't mention any benefits of fossil fuels for example he talks

51:24.240 --> 51:28.960
about agriculture and fossil fuels he only talks about negatives he doesn't once mention

51:28.960 --> 51:34.960
diesel powered agricultural equipment or natural gas derived fertilizer even though those make it

51:34.960 --> 51:40.480
possible for us to feed eight billion people so what we have is an anti-human mentality

51:41.280 --> 51:50.560
so so some of those who are listening likely don't know that the the very survival of about four

51:50.560 --> 51:57.360
billion people so half the world's population depends in no small part on the provision of

51:57.360 --> 52:04.880
ammonia as fertilizer and ammonia is primarily derived from natural gas and so what that means is

52:04.880 --> 52:10.400
the not just on the energy front let's point this out is that the the very food that is

52:10.400 --> 52:17.120
provisioning half the world's population is a direct consequence of the cheap and easy accessibility

52:17.120 --> 52:24.560
of natural gas and so and so what what's the idea here that we're supposed to reduce our

52:25.120 --> 52:30.800
provision of fossil fuels and what are we going to do on the ammonia on the ammonia front we're

52:30.800 --> 52:37.360
going to drive the price of fertilizer ever more skyward well if we do that because that

52:37.360 --> 52:42.800
would be the consequence of reducing the plentiful supply of natural gas if we do that then what will

52:42.800 --> 52:48.880
happen is clearly food will get more expensive and so will energy but food will definitely get more

52:48.880 --> 52:55.280
expensive and so what that will mean is that huge swath of the world's population that's

52:55.280 --> 53:01.040
living on the edge where they can just right now afford enough food to feed themselves so they don't

53:01.760 --> 53:07.600
suffer the consequences of nutritional privation or even die a huge proportion of those people

53:07.600 --> 53:12.160
are going to be tipped back into absolute poverty their children are going to be intellectually

53:12.160 --> 53:16.960
stunted as a consequence and they might well starve and then you think well why would we

53:16.960 --> 53:21.920
do that and if the answer is well you know some of us really believe that the planet should only

53:21.920 --> 53:28.080
have a billion people on it if that if we have to have any people at all then well maybe this is all

53:28.080 --> 53:36.880
part of the unconscious drive towards and and conscious drive to some degree towards reducing

53:36.880 --> 53:41.440
the planet's population no matter what the price may be and then you see how people justify this

53:41.440 --> 53:46.000
they say things like well you know if we don't take emergency action right now which means

53:46.560 --> 53:52.640
let's make the poor even poorer then the poor are really going to suffer a hundred years from now

53:52.640 --> 53:58.320
and I think look I don't have a lot of confidence in your ability to predict even a decade out much

53:58.320 --> 54:04.960
less a hundred years with your unstable economic models that are predicated on an equally unstable

54:04.960 --> 54:09.920
climate model so we can forget about your capacity to prognosticate a hundred years down the road

54:10.560 --> 54:15.440
but what you're saying essentially is that the hypothetical poor that occupy my utopian

54:15.440 --> 54:22.240
imagination are much more important than the actual poor right now who will definitely die

54:22.240 --> 54:29.840
if we implement our higher energy price inducing hypothetical environmental policies

54:29.840 --> 54:34.240
you know and one of the things that strikes me is so utterly absurd it's partly why I found your

54:34.240 --> 54:40.560
book so interesting is that somehow the people who are making such arguments have gained the moral

54:40.560 --> 54:45.680
upper hand even though you don't have to scrape beneath the surface very far to see not only the

54:46.320 --> 54:53.600
genocidal metaphor and the genocidal intent but the actual genocidal impact of these policies

54:53.600 --> 54:57.760
because we're definitely tipping people back into absolute privation

54:59.600 --> 55:03.600
we'll be right back to our conversation with alex epstein in just a moment

55:03.600 --> 55:08.000
first we wanted to give you a sneak peek at jordan's new documentary logos and literacy

55:10.880 --> 55:17.920
I was very much struck by how the translation of the biblical writings jump started the development

55:17.920 --> 55:24.640
of literacy across the entire world illiteracy was the norm the pastor's home was the first school

55:25.200 --> 55:31.600
and every morning it would begin with singing the christian faith is a singing religion probably

55:31.600 --> 55:37.360
80 percent of scripture memorization today exists only because of what is sung this is amazing here

55:37.360 --> 55:46.320
we have a guttenberg bible printed on the press of yohan guttenberg science and religion are opposing

55:46.320 --> 55:53.120
forces in the world but historically that has not been the case now the book is available to everyone

55:53.120 --> 56:01.440
from Shakespeare to modern education and medicine and science to to civilization itself

56:02.000 --> 56:06.800
it is the most influential book in all of history and hopefully people can walk away

56:07.840 --> 56:09.200
with at least a sense of that

56:14.160 --> 56:17.840
yeah there's a lot of there's a lot of really interesting stuff going on I mean I think one

56:17.840 --> 56:22.720
thing why do they have the moral high ground and this is something that is really a core mission of

56:22.720 --> 56:28.080
mine to correct is that as I mentioned before they really owned the issue of a good environment

56:28.080 --> 56:33.440
starting in the 60s including loving nature including caring about clean air and clean water

56:33.440 --> 56:38.400
and more recently caring about safety from climate and that the pro-capitalism side really didn't

56:38.400 --> 56:42.560
concern them to concern themselves too much with this rhetorically at least and so the

56:42.560 --> 56:47.840
anti-capitalist side was able to own this issue and when you own something as important as our

56:47.840 --> 56:53.680
environment and our planet you do get the moral high ground and then they supplemented this

56:53.680 --> 57:00.480
with this false alternative of you are either a climate change believer who hates fossil fuels

57:00.480 --> 57:05.600
or you're a climate change denier who thinks fossil fuels are okay so they created this

57:05.600 --> 57:10.400
total fossil alternative which made no sense because what makes sense with climate impact

57:10.400 --> 57:15.360
is to weigh it along with the benefits of fossil fuels you cannot judge a prescription drug

57:15.360 --> 57:20.080
by only looking at negative side effects and you can't judge fossil fuels by only looking at

57:20.080 --> 57:23.920
negative side effects or exaggerate a negative side effects you have to look carefully at our

57:23.920 --> 57:28.880
climate impacts negative and positive and then weigh them against the benefits that come with

57:28.880 --> 57:33.040
fossil fuels including all the benefits that protect us from climate so there's this false

57:33.040 --> 57:37.760
alternative so what they did is they owned the morality of caring about our environment and they

57:37.760 --> 57:42.720
owned the claim to science because the climate change denial thing so-called didn't make much

57:42.800 --> 57:47.760
sense because it's pretty obvious we impact climate at least some but so doing those two

57:47.760 --> 57:51.600
things they owned this issue so people think well if I want to be a good person if I want a good

57:51.600 --> 57:56.560
planet and I want to be pro-science then I have to hate fossil fuels and a lot of what I've tried

57:56.560 --> 58:00.640
to do and I think Michael Schellenberger of Bjorn Lomborg and Steve Kuhn and I think what we've

58:00.640 --> 58:07.360
tried to do is look at climate in a humanistic full context way and we're breaking this false

58:07.360 --> 58:11.120
alternative which is a lot of the reason we get a lot of hostility so you said something there

58:11.120 --> 58:15.760
that's very psychologically interesting so you said if I want to be a good person

58:16.400 --> 58:22.800
because the environmentalists have captured this pro-planet narrative if I want to be a good person

58:22.800 --> 58:28.560
then I have to buy the human beings are bad for the planet narrative but I'd like to take that

58:28.560 --> 58:35.360
apart a little bit too because it's not exactly true what you said the truth of the matter is

58:35.360 --> 58:41.440
something like if I want to take a shortcut to a good person without having to being a good

58:41.440 --> 58:48.480
person without having to put into the process any real time and effort so that would mean

58:48.480 --> 58:53.200
actually understanding the issues that are associated with environmental management and

58:53.200 --> 58:59.760
economic sustainability which is unbelievably complicated I mean Bjorn while in U2 Schellenberger

58:59.760 --> 59:04.800
spent their whole lives devoted to that endeavor trying to wade through the complexities it's

59:04.800 --> 59:11.920
actually really difficult to develop a sophisticated and genuinely moral stance on the environment

59:11.920 --> 59:18.320
and the economy it takes years and years of work and it's also extremely difficult to be a good

59:18.320 --> 59:24.160
person and merely feeling sorry for the planet does not make you a good person in fact what it

59:24.160 --> 59:31.760
makes you is a shallow narcissist who's using the easy identification with a genocidal ideology

59:31.760 --> 59:39.920
to elevate yourself in the moral hierarchy and we we see people who are peddling this this dreadful

59:40.960 --> 59:46.960
story to young people and offering them an easy shortcut to something approximating

59:46.960 --> 59:51.440
easily trumpeted moral virtue and that's the sort of moral virtue that you can post on your

59:51.440 --> 59:56.480
Facebook page when you claim that while you're anti-capitalist and you're in favor of the planet

59:56.480 --> 01:00:00.880
and therefore all of a sudden you're actually a moral actor and someone to be regarded with

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:06.160
admiration and none of that's true because it's actually it's very difficult to be a good person

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:12.160
but it's very powerful that I agree entirely but it is very powerful and one thing I talk

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:18.080
about in fossil future and this is a big mission of mine is the moral monopoly of what I call the

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:23.520
moral case for eliminating fossil fuels has to be broken and when you have what I call a moral

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:29.520
monopoly you basically get a halo over your head for saying I hate fossil fuels I care about the

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:34.560
climate I care about the planet you don't need to do anything you just need to express this sentiment

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:38.640
doesn't matter you can we see you can fly on private jets you can live any lifestyle that you

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:44.160
want as long as you say this you get this halo and the other side gets devil horns on their head

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:48.400
but part of what's happened with what I call the energy humanists including me and Bjorn and Michael

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:55.760
and Steve is that we have now shown that actually quote saving the planet in their false view is

01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:02.000
hurting billions of people and dooming them to poverty and actually making our environment worse

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.760
and hurting biology and so now they hate that that's why there's such vicious attacks because

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:12.800
their racket is coming to a close you you want it to be a controversial the first thing before

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:17.280
winning a debate is actually creating a debate there hasn't even been a debate over the morality

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:22.560
of fossil fuels intel fairly recently and once the debate is created that that easy claim to

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:27.680
virtue will disappear and those people will just go pick the the next easy thing to join

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:35.120
yeah well you said that all you have to do is express the sentiment that you care for the

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:40.320
planet so that's something approximating a feeling or a subjective state of mind let's say yes I'm a

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:47.520
good person because I feel empathy for the planet which is a pretty damn low resolution definition

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:53.040
implementable morality but you know it's tied in with something else too so imagine you're trying

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:58.880
desperately to make that case that the reason I'm good is because I feel sorry for things including

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:06.160
the planet well then you have to also buttress that claim with the insistence that sentiment

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:12.880
subjective sentiment itself is the only valid arbiter of reality and so that's something like

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:21.120
I feel therefore I am and I see that this in this entire modern movement that insists that identity

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:28.240
is nothing other than subjective feeling is actually associated in a perverse manner

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:34.560
with this ability to justify a claim to moral superiority by appeal to sentiment it's like

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:42.240
it's people see a picture of a like a bedraggled kitten on on on the internet and they go oh

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:48.080
and they think that because they have that reflexive response which you know has a certain moral virtue

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:54.560
that all of a sudden they're morally admirable people and that's a lovely thing to believe

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:59.840
and you can extend that to something like well I'm so concerned about the planet that I can barely

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:05.280
sleep at night it's like well fair enough that might be an indicator of your moral virtue although

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:10.800
I suspect not but the real question is do you actually know anything about the problem have

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:17.520
you spent any work real work in differentiating your knowledge of the problem are you taking any

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:24.080
concrete steps whatsoever to solve it apart from hand waving sentimentally and do you have metrics

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:28.960
in place that actually help you measure whether or not what you're doing has a beneficial impact

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:34.800
and that's also complex that if you bring to people's attention the necessity of thinking it through

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:39.440
all they do is get irritated at you like they get irritated with longberg's a classic example

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:46.080
because he's the person I think and I'd like your opinion on this you know I don't think there is

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:53.120
anybody who's a more effective advocate for genuine progress on the environmental front

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:59.120
than Bjorn Lombard he's thought it through as far as I can tell more deeply than anyone else

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:07.760
perhaps in the world and it's stunning to me the degree to which his ideals fail to gain traction

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:11.600
and I think partly it's because he makes the issue complicated right he says well we don't

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:19.120
have just one problem too much carbon we have like 20 problems or a hundred and and they all

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:23.680
need to be attended to but we need to rank order them and we have to do that in a methodologically

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:28.800
rigorous manner it's like well we don't want to do any of that we just want to feel good about what

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:33.840
we feel good about and we want to make a claim that that makes us morally virtuous and it's certainly

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:40.560
the case as far as I can tell that our educational systems are enticing young people to adopt exactly

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:47.040
that attitude and then to also engage in this demonization that you described so I think one

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:53.040
powerful dynamic with this this free virtue that you get by just saying I care about this issue I

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:58.960
care about the planet is that it's been given the stamp of science because it's considered scientific

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:03.440
to just say hey the planet is being destroyed by fossil fuels we need to do something about it

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:08.640
and it's really as long as you feel some way or you vote some way that is considered totally

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:13.920
sufficient there's nothing to think about but so it's really sad and shameful that science

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:18.640
has been has been stamped on this incredibly irresponsible way of thinking and one thing

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:22.720
I've tried to do and I think Bjorn does this but I think I do it probably most explicitly and I

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:27.600
think it's very very important to do it explicitly is I keep talking about the benefits of fossil

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:33.120
fuels and how how the other side is ignoring the benefits of fossil fuels so I go as far as to call

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:37.840
the other side fossil fuel benefit deniers I also call them climate mastery deniers because

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:43.040
they deny our ability to master climate danger and I think people can really get that we're

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:47.360
thinking about this issue in a way that makes no sense because we're only looking at the negative

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:51.520
side effects of fossil fuels we're not looking at the benefits and if you look at my work the

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:56.720
moral case for fossil fuels fossil future it's really stressing the goodness of fossil fuels

01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:01.920
not just fossil fuels aren't as bad as you think but they're an actual positive good and I've seen

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:06.720
you make this case as well I think it's very very powerful it's imagine my book had been called

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:12.080
fossil fuels aren't quite as bad as you think it would have been no impact what's really needed

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:17.760
we've had this inverted morality that said that that says that food is poison and poison is food

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:22.080
and I think it's not enough to just to say oh they go too far it's to say no they are attacking

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:27.680
something good and once you are having a positive case for fossil fuels the other side goes on the

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:32.160
defensive you watch what happens when I debate when people will debate me they don't really have

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:37.360
an answer to looking at the full picture their answer is call me a climate change denier try to

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:42.880
smear me but they can't answer the argument of if you look at the full context benefits and

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:47.200
side effects of what's good for human flourishing fossil fuels are incredibly good and will remain

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:52.400
good for the foreseeable future and it's a pretty subtle argument that that climate change denier

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:57.600
phrase is a real interesting one too because that's a phrase that's so manipulatively

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:02.800
propagandistic that it's almost incomprehensible I mean the reason that that phrase emerged is

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:10.160
because there's been we've developed a universal consensus that denying the reality of the Holocaust

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:16.480
was a moral crime and so the propagandists took a leaf from that page and said well the people

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:22.480
who are denying the cataclysmic reality of climate change are as morally culpable as those who

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:27.600
deny the Holocaust which implies that they're as culpable as the Nazis who run the death camps

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:32.960
and that's a pretty decent smear and then you might say well what's the moral advantage to doing

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:38.160
that and so the first thing you might point out is well you get to have all the unearned moral

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:43.920
virtue that goes along with saying that just because you're sentimental about the planet

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:49.680
in some vague way that you're now a moral paragon and that solves all your moral problems

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:56.560
and then conveniently at the same time you get to identify a group of people who are essentially

01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:02.000
satanic in their motivations and so that would be the climate change deniers and so that entire

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.560
problem of evil which you no longer contend with in your own life because you're on the side of the

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:12.480
moral is dumped at the feet of the people that you deem as enemies that's that form of scapegoating

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:18.320
that René Girard talked about and so young people are being enticed to do two things is one is to

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:26.400
adopt it three things to adopt an extremely simple minded view of the problems and opportunities that

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:33.360
confront us second to claim a completely unearned moral virtue merely on the basis of a vague sentiment

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:41.040
and third and more dangerously to localize the problem of evil in the minds and souls of the

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:46.880
people who are hypothetically opposed to their self aggrandizing sentiment and the combination of

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:52.720
those three moral errors is really dangerously toxic and that dangerous toxicity I would say is

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:58.400
manifesting itself in such things as these this idiot insistence let's say in the UK

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:04.160
because they're suffering from this more than any other place now maybe except Germany on the moral

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:09.920
benefits of an impossible net zero right the the rubber is really starting to hit the road

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:15.040
in the last couple of years as energy prices have spiked out of out of reach of many people

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:21.600
and the unreliability of these hypothetically benevolent renewables has become more and more

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:29.200
self-evident and so we're walking a very dangerous moral path here right easy moral virtue the the

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:35.120
our inability to point out that a lot of this moral virtue is driven by an unthinking ignorance

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:40.480
combined with this temptation to demonize those who are like lomborg shellenberger you

01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:45.600
you're a good example as well who are standing up and saying hey wait a minute everyone um

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:52.480
we've lifted billions of people out of absolute privation and starvation as a consequence of the

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:57.920
utilization of fossil fuels and they're so fundamental that we can't shift away from them

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:03.200
rapidly that's actually practically impossible without tilting people into the kind of abject

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:07.600
poverty that's going to cause widespread starvation it's like that doesn't sound like a case being made

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:15.920
by satan to me no it's um i mean i do think that the energy crisis is an enormous educational

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:20.560
opportunity and it's obviously a tragedy and it's as somebody who's been talking about this for 15

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:26.560
years and advising in the opposite direction it's very sad to see me myself being right

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:31.360
in terms of if you artificially restrict the supply of fossil fuels in a world that needs

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:36.080
more energy and you don't have a viable near-term replacement then prices are going to skyrocket

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:39.760
including food prices and the price of everything else like this is this was obvious that this was

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:44.720
going to happen and it's hard to see it but at least the benefit is that people can see that the

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:50.480
establishment has failed that's the benefit of a crisis people see the establishment has failed

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:55.600
and the key is in my view two things one is the right people need to be implicated and the right

01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:00.400
people need to be vindicated and i say the right people need to be implicated not as a vindictive

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:05.440
person at all uh but it's very important when you have a crisis and this happened with 9-11

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:09.680
happened with the financial crisis you know you need to have some idea of who is responsible

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:14.720
and then who was right and gave us better advice if you look at today's energy crisis

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:20.320
the number one thing that is scary about it is that it is a crisis that has come from the from

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:26.160
the net zero movement not even only achieving one percent of their goals so they have not even reduced

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:31.280
the supply of fossil fuels i want to stress that again they haven't even reduced the supply

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:35.760
they just slowed its rate of growth they already wanted to dramatically reduce the supply that was

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:41.120
their goal we were supposed to be using way less fossil fuel by now they just slowed the growth

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:46.160
and that was enough to cause a global energy crisis in a world that needs far more energy

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:50.400
so that should really wake us up what if we actually start on their path of getting rid of

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:56.320
fossil fuels and again we have 27 years now 27 years and less than a month as we record this

01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:00.720
to achieve net zero which in effect means getting rid of fossil fuels we could talk about offsets

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:06.240
and stuff that doesn't work at any scale that there's any evidence of so it's really this this

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:11.280
homicidal movement in its in its consequences and i do think people are waking up and they're

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:16.080
particularly waking up to the idea that hey we ignored the benefits of fossil fuels or what i

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:20.960
call our designated experts did this and these people need to be jettisoned you cannot listen

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:25.680
to anybody about energy and climate who ignores the benefits of fossil fuels to billions of people

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:30.320
because if you do you get an energy crisis and if we keep listening to them it's going to get a lot

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:36.400
worse well the other thing that you see being the drum being beaten on the side of the radical left

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:44.240
for example is the anti-colonial um let's say this continual trumpeting of the anti-colonial

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:50.880
interference message and so then i look at that and i think well you give the devil is due and the

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:55.600
fact that the world's cultures have come into contact with one another in a dramatic way in the

01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:02.880
last 300 years has produced all sorts of consequences some positive and some negative but um on the

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:08.080
anti-colonial front the environmental proposition and this is mostly coming from the radical left is

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:16.720
that there's no possible way that the third world inhabitants can be allowed much less encouraged

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:23.600
to develop a standard of living that in any manner approximates the profligate west is that

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:28.240
we're rich and you know maybe we should suffer from that a bit and maybe we should pay reparations

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:33.040
let's say but all those poor people who are desperately trying to clamber up the socioeconomic

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:39.280
hierarchy so they don't die let's let's make that perfectly clear they can't be allowed to do that

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:44.960
because their environmental footprint will immediately become so large that the planet

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:50.400
itself will be destroyed and so okay what's the consequence of that well the consequence of that

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:56.400
is that they should be poor and stay that way and should shut the hell up about it and should be happy

01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:02.560
about it and perhaps there should be a hell of a lot fewer of them and if that doesn't trigger

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:09.760
your anti-colonialist morality then you've got some serious thinking to do because i just don't

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:15.120
understand at all how it is that those of us in the wealthy west and this would certainly include

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:23.280
those in the chattering environmental glitterati elite class i have no sense whatsoever how they're

01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:30.960
in a moral position to be lecturing the developing world about how they should accept limits to growth

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:35.920
which means for example that their children won't have access to enough nutrition to even

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:41.360
optimize their their brain development as they mature it's like oh that's the price those people

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:48.320
get to pay hey those people those poor people in developing countries who don't get to be wealthy

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:54.080
and by wealthy means have enough to eat and have schools to send their children and we in the western

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:59.200
world we can sit on our high horse and say well we used fossil fuels and oops sorry about that and

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:05.600
all the carbon but you bastards you can just you can just accept your lot and if you stop breeding

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:11.280
so god damn much that would be a good thing too now how that is it's colonial to a degree that's

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:18.320
overwhelming is beyond me well it's it is and i think it's a very very powerful argument it's

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:23.120
been one of these things that has been ignored because the priorities of the modern environmental

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:27.040
movement are not what they say and i would say more broadly the anti-capitalist movement

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:31.680
they claim to be concerned about the poor but if you're concerned about the poor and you know that

01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:37.120
fossil fueled productivity has brought an unprecedented number of people out of poverty

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:42.000
in recent decades you would think about how do we expand that how do we replicate what happened

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.800
in china what happened in india you know some changes to it obviously but how do we how do we

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:51.920
you know they use seven times more fossil fuels compared to four forty years ago like it's it's

01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:57.360
obviously fueled their productivity and their prosperity why don't we do more of that and yet

01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:02.160
there's been no attention paid in the culture to the energy poor there's no attention paid to the

01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:07.040
fact we have three billion people who use less electricity than one of our refrigerators uses

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:11.360
we have a third of the world using wood and animal dung to eat their homes and to cook their food

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:15.760
and in terms of you're mentioning wealthy people three quarters of the world uses an amount of

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:20.880
energy that that we would consider totally unacceptable in the us or canada or anything

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:27.360
resembling that so once these facts are pointed out it is obvious that there is a moral imperative

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:34.240
to do at least nothing to get in the way of people using at least that at least that and it's clear

01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:38.320
that the anti fossil fuel movement is absolutely getting in the way they're trying to destroy

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:43.920
all loans to fossil fuels there they're trying to encourage them to use things that will not

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:47.840
actually work for them they're trying to for example throughout africa limit oil and gas

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:52.880
development even though that's a huge potential source of prosperity but they're not winning this

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:57.200
argument once sunlight has been exposed and i had a personal experience i don't know if you heard

01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:01.920
about this but the washington post tried to basically cancel my book fossil future back

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:06.320
before it came out they got a copy of the book they didn't read the book which i thought that was

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:11.280
their job as journalists to report on a book from a major author instead what they tried to do is

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:17.440
dig up what i had written in college where i had said very specifically the poor world needs more

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:22.640
capitalism and more individualism which i stand by but they somehow tried to portray that as

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:27.920
colonialism but here's the key their whole argument was alex epstein doesn't really care about the

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:32.640
poor so you don't have to listen to his arguments about the poor needing fossil fuels that this is

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:38.160
a bizarre ad hominem on its face it's completely the opposite of the truth but it was notable to me

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:43.440
how they had no answer to this argument that poor people need fossil fuels and that the

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:48.640
anti fossil fuel movement hurts the poor people most so i think that really shows the power of

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:54.480
this argument let's delve into that issue of caring about the poor because i don't think that

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:59.520
it is really all that wise for any of us to jump up and down about how much we care for the poor

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:04.880
because if you cared for the poor you'd be out there doing something with your life to directly

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:10.000
benefit the poor and that turns out to be extremely well i i have to i have to i don't mean i don't

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.760
mean you i don't mean you okay speaking more generally it's not that easy to care about the

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:21.280
poor and so i think that any of us who trumpet the idea that we truly care about the poor should

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:27.840
be very careful about that but having said that i would also say we could though say even if we

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:33.360
don't care about the poor any more than the typical somewhat selfish human being we could at least get

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:38.800
the hell out of their way when they're trying to clamber their way up the socioeconomic hierarchy

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:43.200
and that was the case that you made just a few minutes ago is that we could at least in the west

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:50.640
not implement policies that actually interfere in a serious manner with the attempts of the

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:54.880
developing world to lift themselves out of absolute privation we could at least get the

01:18:54.880 --> 01:19:00.000
hell out of the road and we wouldn't have to do that by hand waving about how moral we are in

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:06.160
our care for the poor we could say well we're relatively disinterested at minimum but we won't

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:11.920
go out of our way to make your lives more miserable than they have to be while you use your own efforts

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:17.360
to acquire for yourself some of the things that we've managed to acquire we can't even do that

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:22.080
i think it's a great point and so for me yeah i don't want to act like i'm just

01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:26.960
ministering to every poor person in the world or this kind of thing i mean look i i live in a free

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:33.040
country i love doing work that i find really interesting and i love that it benefits a lot

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:38.320
of people including some of the poorest people in the world and one that the particular way in which

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:43.440
i identify with the poorest people in the world is with the lack of freedom because i really think

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:48.160
about what what would it like be like to not be born in the u.s whatever advantages i had being born

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:54.560
in the u.s is by far the greatest and i really think about you know how can more people be born

01:19:54.560 --> 01:20:01.120
into that and really the number one thing we need to do is spread good ideas and not spread bad ideas

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:05.360
and and this is where the antifausal field movement is so destructive particularly you've

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:10.240
probably seen this recent climate reparations thing yeah which is saying hey we owe the poor world

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:14.880
and i i wrote about this recently people can see it at energytalkingpoints.com which is where i post

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:21.040
my new stuff but the there's there's the idea that we should feel guilty for ruining the world and i

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:25.200
believe we've made the world better for everyone including the poor but the other element that

01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:31.360
is obviously wrong is what is happening is we are paying people off usually dictators off

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:37.040
to not use fossil fuels so we are paying them to deprive people of the crucial freedom

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:42.320
to get prosperity and that is just totally shameful and that is absolutely interfering

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:48.480
in the lives of the world's poorest people right so with our so-called climate reparations

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:54.160
that are going to be devoted to the the governments of third world countries primarily we're going

01:20:54.160 --> 01:21:00.320
to be propping up frequently brutal quasi dictatorships and bribing them to keep their

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:06.800
populations poor yes so that we don't save the planet that's our plan

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:15.280
that is that is a plan i mean again it's it's not a movement that actually has any kind of goal

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:21.680
in strategy long term it's really just hostility toward any impact and at the moment it's CO2

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:26.720
emissions so anything that has CO2 emissions you hate but observe look there's no enthusiasm for

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:31.520
nuclear right which you would expect them to love because it doesn't emit CO2 there's hatred

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:36.640
for nuclear there's hatred for hydro and there's hatred for mining which is necessary for solar

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:41.600
and wind which require way more mined materials than anything else there's so it's really an

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:47.440
anti-impact movement that's just hostile to any human impact and just nihilistically and randomly

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:52.800
pursues that with no strategy and no thinking about the future and this mentality is leading the

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:58.320
world this is what i call our knowledge system it is blindly pursuing this destructive anti-human

01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:04.240
path with no strategy okay so let's let's delve into that a little bit that motivation for that so

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:11.760
i'm going to play devil's advocate here a bit and and and let you respond to it so the first

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:18.320
thing we might point out is that the the human proclivity for something approximating unspoiled

01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:24.000
natural vistas actually seems to have a moral element and a biologically rooted moral element

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:31.760
so for example our our aesthetic preferences seem to be associated with something like preference

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:37.520
for natural landscapes that are verdant and green and potentially productive in relationship to

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:44.400
agriculture and and the flourishing of let's say edible animals with enough water we like landscapes

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:48.960
that look like that we think they're beautiful and the idea that we might prefer those if they were

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:56.800
unspoiled is also worth delving into to some degree because we do need to live in

01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:04.640
balanced harmony with such environments so that we don't destroy the very virtue that they

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:10.720
they implicitly contain and so and our aesthetic preferences tilt us in that direction and so we

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:19.120
have a bit of a biological tilt towards not wanting to gum up and pollute the works okay so

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:26.720
so there's that and then we also have this moral sense that we have a moral obligation right and

01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:36.640
so the moral obligation is to be grateful to be cognizant of our unearned privilege and so for

01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:41.520
you that would be the fact that you were born in the united states and that you were a accidental

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:46.880
beneficiary of all the work that had gone into that great society before you made your appearance

01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:52.000
on the scene and that there's a moral obligation on your part in some sense to do something about

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:58.880
that right and so and that can both of those can be warped the warping of the first one is

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:05.440
to push that moral and aesthetic sensibility to the point where we claim that any human

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:13.920
interaction with that pristine environment whatsoever is tantamount to immorality and on

01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:23.120
the second front it is that the way to atone for our privilege is by being guilty and stopping all

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:31.280
activity so those things dovetail we might say instead that if we wanted to genuinely contend

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:36.960
with the problem of our unearned privilege and the fact that you know we walk on blood that is

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:42.720
being we walk on land that is being soaked by the blood of conflict for generations right there's a

01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:48.000
certain guilt in that a certain sense you might say even of original sin is that we do have to atone

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:54.320
but the proper proposition on the sophisticated front would be something like well we should atone

01:24:54.320 --> 01:25:00.640
by putting into place thoughtful and intelligent and genuinely pro-human environmental slash

01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:07.360
economic policies and we should atone in our private lives for our unearned privilege by being

01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:14.960
people whose moral striving is so admirable that we've justified the existence of our privileges

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:20.960
and we shouldn't be taking the easy way out and saying just because we're sentimental about Gaia

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:26.480
means that we've somehow fulfilled our moral obligation we're doing a very bad job of teaching

01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:32.480
young people this as far as I can tell so like the guilt's there right the the sense of original

01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:37.760
sin is there the sense that we're responsible for the atrocity of history in some sense is there

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:42.800
that needs to be contended with but we're constantly looking for easy ways out of the problem instead

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:48.640
of actually trying to address it head on well let's start out with the the first part in terms of

01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:54.160
this this like sense of what we like in natural landscapes and we like life and so I certainly

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:59.360
have a version of this myself I mean I'm very obsessed with the ocean and I spend way more time

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:05.280
outdoors than most people and I just like I think people underrate being outdoors a lot and and you

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:09.840
know I love seeing different kinds of animals and their natural habitat so like I definitely

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:16.080
experienced this but when I when I think of it then what I think about is in impacting the earth

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:20.720
we want to make sure we impact the earth in a way that allows us to really enjoy this and in fact

01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:26.240
have more of it there's a lot of things we can do to make the earth more beautiful and to enhance it

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:30.480
with respect to our aesthetic sensibilities and I think the the best thing forever in this regard

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:35.760
was Frank Lloyd Wright because if you look at his buildings and how he approached it he loved nature

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:40.240
but he also thought that we could improve nature and that's really what you're doing as a human

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:44.960
being is you're saying I can improve nature so you're not hostile to nature but you view it as

01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:50.080
what I call wild potential it has the potential to be an amazing place for us it has all these

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:53.520
different building blocks and all these starting things and some of them we want to preserve

01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:57.040
some of them we want to change a lot and even the things we want to preserve we want to make a

01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:02.880
lot more accessible to everyone which requires changing a lot so I think of it as we can do an

01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:09.040
even better job at making the earth an amazing place to live but part of that is recognizing

01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:14.080
we've done a really good job in a lot of ways the earth is so much of a better place to live than it

01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:22.320
was 500 years ago 200 years ago the world is is is you know it's naturally uh it's naturally dynamic

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:26.880
it's deficient and it's dangerous it's like those are three attributes that's why I call it wild

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:32.480
potential and so human beings have had to contend with that and to bring up fossil fuels our basic

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:38.480
way of contending with that is to try to produce a lot of value that nature doesn't produce for us

01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:42.720
nature produces not very much value that we can use and it produces a lot of threat so we need

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:48.400
productive ability to create resources nature doesn't including to create resources that neutralize

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:53.040
the different threats like creating irrigation to neutralize drought and what we do that with

01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:58.240
our productive ability but we're naturally very physically weak beings and so the key step is

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:03.680
using machines to produce far more value than our meager physical bodies can and that's what we've

01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:08.400
done with fossil fuels we've had cost effective energy that has allowed say the average american

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:14.240
to have 75 machine servants producing value so that we can do far more than we ever could

01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:19.360
and we can do types of things that we never could like no number of human beings can fly

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:23.680
no number of human beings can be an incubator which you know save millions incubator save

01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:29.200
millions of lives so we've made the earth so much of a better place and I think we can make it even

01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:34.480
more beautiful and I think a lot of the specific things we create are ugly and that's a shame but

01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:39.840
I think of it as we've done a good job and we can do even better not that we're these sinners who

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:45.600
have ruined who ruin everything by touching it that is a that is a hostile view and it's an unjustified

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:50.080
view so I think we can be more like Frank Lloyd Wright but we should be proud of what we've done

01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:55.040
so far and in terms of obligation I mean I feel gratitude for it I don't feel like

01:28:55.040 --> 01:29:01.200
anyone has really sinned or I've sinned or but I feel like the obligation is to is to keep going

01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:05.280
trying to make it better and better and I think just by being a productive person

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:09.760
that's really what you're doing but because I think about global issues I try to advise people

01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:16.640
globally so let me ask you about this psychologically so obviously people there are a lot of people

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:21.920
particularly young people perhaps who are bearing a heavy load of existential guilt for the fact of

01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:28.880
their very existence and so you just made something approximating a pro-human case and so I would ask

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:35.760
you a psychological question how do you think you've conducted yourself in your own life

01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:43.920
effectively so that that sense of existential guilt that potential hostility towards human

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:49.280
endeavor itself or even human existence has been ameliorated like what have you done that you

01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:56.000
believe is sufficiently valuable to justify the cost of your own existence but I guess

01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:01.280
why would I I don't understand why I would feel it in the first place because the people who feel

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:05.360
it have a very warped at least the environmental version we can talk about other versions but

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:10.560
the environmental slash climate version is this very warped delicate nurture view of the earth

01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:15.280
that the earth is stable sufficient and safe and our impact ruins it and if you believe that

01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:20.640
and you hear all this propaganda then you think yeah we're all you we're all ruining the delicate

01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:26.240
nurture but if you have that view it's a very damaging view but I don't have the view so I don't

01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:30.880
understand why I would feel so bad yeah but people that's the thing is that and I think we need to

01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:38.400
contend with this right because people do have that view and lots of people have it and it's easy

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:43.520
let's say for educators who are pushing this ideological agenda to capitalize on the prevalence

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:49.200
of that view that's why I'm pointing to something like an intrinsic sense of original sin is that

01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:53.360
we have this sense as human beings or many people do that in some real sense

01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:59.040
we have to atone for the crime of our existence and I think there's something to that I think that

01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:06.240
we have to bear a moral burden that justifies the the crime of our existence so to speak

01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:11.920
and that would mean that we have to be genuinely well in your terminology we have to be genuinely

01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:16.320
productive people let's say we have to be genuinely productive people that are aiming up

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:21.520
maybe in relationship to such things as working for the amelioration of absolute poverty like

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:27.520
there is a moral calling there and I think that part I think of it differently okay I think of it

01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:32.640
differently so I think of existence as an opportunity so I think of it as it's just this

01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:37.680
amazingly special thing that you know any of us exist in the first place I mean probably you

01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:42.400
think about the probabilistic nature of it and I feel like being on earth is just this amazing

01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:46.480
opportunity and you can look at how different people have handled that throughout history and

01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:51.120
how they handle it today and I think a lot of people tragically haven't made the most of it but I

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:55.600
think you can see certain things that people do who have made the most of it and find it fulfilling

01:31:55.600 --> 01:32:00.720
and for me one of the observations is people who choose a certain kind of creative work it

01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:04.720
it is makes a huge difference I'm guessing you've experienced I've certainly experienced this in

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:10.400
terms of just finding something that creates value in the world that really really works with

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:14.960
how you like to use your mind the thought process hopefully you get to work with certain kinds of

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:20.400
people I mean that's just part of it there are all kinds of other opportunities of being alive so I

01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:25.440
don't think about it all as oh it's we're guilty and this is bad I think the only guilt is wasting

01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:30.720
the opportunity that's that's where my kind of fear and guilt come in is like I worry about oh did I

01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:35.120
waste the opportunity of being alive and part of that is of course you don't want to live at the

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:40.240
expense of others and ruin the world that's another way of wasting it but so I think of life as

01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:46.000
opportunity not as not as atonement well right and we should also we could address there too the

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:52.560
issue that if you conduct yourself successfully so let's say that you are as a consequence prosperous

01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:58.400
there is also this underlying presumption that's generally unexamined that you had to do that at

01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:03.280
someone else's expense right it's something like a zero sum game and that ties into this whole

01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:09.680
Malthusian view that were yeast in a petri dish with finite resources and the truth of the matter

01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:17.760
I think is that if you conduct yourself in the highest manner properly then you end up being

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:23.840
creatively productive in a manner that doesn't just benefit you selfishly but simultaneously

01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:30.080
benefits many other people and also facilitates their ability to do the same thing and so that's

01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:35.600
a vision of a kind of harmony that's a high-order ethical calling is you don't have to pursue your

01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:43.760
creative exploitation of possibility at the cost of the possibility or at the cost of other people

01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:48.720
quite the contrary you could increase the possibility which we could do on the natural front

01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:54.640
and you could increase the ability of others to flourish simultaneously yes and I want to really

01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:59.920
highlight because earlier you responded you said all these people have been have been immersed

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:04.640
in this what I call this dogma this delicate nurture dogma and I would add a piece to this

01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:09.600
dogma it's it's the view that the earth is delicate nurture that say stable sufficient and safe and

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:14.480
then it goes along with what I call the parasite polluter view of human beings what you're getting

01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:19.120
out with the Malthusian view so the view that all we do with our impact is we take from the earth

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:24.800
and we destroy it we make it ugly we disrupt it in this kind of thing and in so far as you view

01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:29.440
the world this way you are going to have a bad life and you're going to be really unhappy

01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:33.280
because you're going to feel really guilty and you're going to feel really pessimistic

01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:37.920
and you're going to believe in all of these apocalyptic scenarios so it's it's why it's a

01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:43.280
fundamental thing that needs to be done to reeducate people about the basic nature of earth

01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:49.120
and the basic nature of human beings and replace so delicate nurture with what I call wild potential

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:54.640
and this parasite polluter view with what I call the producer improve our view we actually produce

01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:59.920
value and we can improve the earth and we can do even more and in fossil future I talk about this

01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:04.560
as part of the human flourishing framework a key part of how we have to think about this issue

01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:11.040
is change our view of human beings and earth from an anti-human view to a pro-human view and if once

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:15.120
you change that in people it is life changing because it's their their whole view of how the

01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:20.880
world works changes from this terribly sad and destructive view to a very optimistic view and

01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:26.080
that that's one of the things I'm grateful for is early on I learned pro-human environmental

01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:31.920
philosophy and that was a huge gift that I got when I was 18 how did you learn that why were you

01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:36.560
fortunate enough to learn that well maybe we'll leave that look we have to stop we have to stop

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:41.760
this part of it we'll get into that in the next part of our discussion so for everybody who's

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:48.160
watching and listening I do an extra half an hour with my guests on the daily wire plus platform

01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:53.840
as part of the arrangement that I've made with them to increase the professional appearance and

01:35:53.840 --> 01:36:00.960
quality of my podcasts for example which as you are noticing are still available on YouTube free

01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:05.840
for wide distribution I do an extra half an hour with people I would be interested and I'm going

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:15.200
to continue to talk to to elix on the daily wire plus platform about his philosophical journey

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:21.360
because you've definitely taken an unpopular stance and a minority unpopular stance and you

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:26.960
did that pretty early 2014 is pretty early given all things considered and and you did it quite

01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:32.080
successfully you haven't been particularly effectively cancelled interestingly enough

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:38.000
and I'd like to find out what your pathway was to your realizations and how you manage that

01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:44.400
hello everyone I would encourage you to continue listening to my conversation with my guest

01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:50.400
on dailywireplus.com
