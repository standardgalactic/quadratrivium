0	7120	It leaves me open mouthed in amazement that we in the developed world with our functional
7120	12840	economies and our high level of luxury and security can say to developing worlds the
12840	16800	developing world, well, you know, we've got a pretty good here and we're probably willing
16800	21800	to cut back a little bit, but you guys down there in the developing countries, you know,
21800	24800	you should be pretty damn careful about your carbon output.
24800	29080	We're not going to help you develop your economy so that you can benefit from the same industrial
29080	35640	revolution that has enabled us to educate our children and to have plenty to eat and
35640	38240	to be warm in the winter and cool in the summer.
38240	43320	And then what's even more preposterous is it's the very people who are constantly clamoring
43320	50120	about the oppressive nature of Western culture who are foisting this very story on these
50120	51440	developed countries.
51440	59440	Yeah, the irony is that even if the African nations were given, you know, the carbon credits
59440	65440	or whatever and allowed to develop to where they want to be and where anyone expects them
65440	71360	to be, at most they would be emitting like five or six percent of global emissions and
71360	75960	this is for like a billion people in the population.
75960	80400	We're not talking about a lot of extra emissions to allow them to develop.
80960	84920	I mean, it just makes absolutely no sense and it's evil.
84920	86320	It's absolutely evil.
100320	103160	Hello everyone on YouTube and associated platforms.
103160	107160	I'm here today with another climate denialist because, you know, I've been racking those
107160	108160	up.
108280	112440	It's all part of my attempt to become the most reprehensible commentator on YouTube.
112440	116080	And so, at least in the eyes of those who think they're my enemies.
116080	120240	Anyways, I'm talking to Dr. Judith Curry today, a very accomplished scientist.
120240	125760	She's an American climatologist with a bachelor in science degree in geography, she earned
125760	130240	out at Northern Illinois University and a geophysical sciences PhD from the University
130240	131760	of Chicago.
131760	136520	Curry is the professor emerita and former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric
136520	139880	Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
139880	143760	She's had an accomplished career working with NASA, the U.S. government and numerous
143760	147520	academic institutions in the field of climate change.
147520	155160	A real scientist with 190 publications, Curry advocates, so reprehensibly, for a non-alarmist
155160	159240	approach acknowledging Earth's rising temperature with a grain of salt.
159240	164280	The grain being in field research and a refusal to shut the doors of science to those with
164320	166520	contrary views and findings.
166520	172240	In 2017, Dr. Curry retired from reposition at the Georgia Institute of Technology, citing
172240	179760	the poisonous nature of the scientific discussion around man-made climate change as a key factor.
179760	184880	Curry co-founded and acts as president of the Climate Forecast Applications Network,
184880	189600	a company, a private company which seeks to translate cutting-edge weather and climate
189600	193280	research into tenable forecast products.
193280	197280	Insurance companies, financial institutions rely on Dr. Curry to provide them with information
197280	202360	that can guide them with regard to their future financial decision-making.
202360	207000	She's a controversial figure on the climate front, being somewhat of a contrarian in regard
207000	212440	to the hypothetical scientific consensus on the climate apocalypse front.
212440	216840	So the first thing I'd like to ask you, Dr. Curry, is if you would walk people through
216840	224160	your professional qualifications and to let everyone know why it is that you might be
224160	227640	regarded as a credible commentator on such issues.
227640	236800	Okay, well I received my PhD in 1982 in Geophysical Sciences from the University of Chicago.
236800	245440	And I spent my entire career in academia with jobs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
245440	253360	Purdue University, Penn State University, University of Colorado Boulder, and most recently
253360	256520	at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
256520	262400	And at Georgia Tech, I served as chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences
262400	267080	for 13 years.
267080	274080	I've written several books and published about 190 journal articles.
274080	282360	I'm a fellow of several major professional societies, have received some recognition
282360	285280	for my research.
285280	289960	I left my university position in 2017.
289960	293600	I felt it was too constraining.
293600	297960	I wanted to do a broader range of things.
297960	302160	And I had started a company about 10 years before.
302160	309320	It was a startup under Georgia Tech's Venture Lab program.
309320	317360	And so then I started devoting full time to it after I left academia.
317360	326920	I inadvertently stepped into the limelight on the global warming issue in 2005.
326920	335200	If you recall at the time of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans, I and my co-authors
335200	344120	had a paper that was published in the journal Science two weeks after Katrina hit.
344120	352080	And we had found that the percentage of category four and five hurricanes had doubled in recent
352080	353480	decades.
353480	360120	And so this was with rather explosive media attention.
360120	366840	And this was the first time that I did TV interviews or anything like that.
366840	372720	And it was a very antagonistic debate.
372720	374840	People were coming at us from all sides.
374840	381720	Of course, the Enviro advocacy groups thought I was the greatest thing since sliced bread.
381840	390400	There are a lot of people on the other side of the debate thought I was absolutely evil.
390400	396160	So for the first time, I started giving a lot of public lectures.
396160	402040	And people would invariably ask me questions that were outside of my expertise or knowledge.
402040	407160	Everyone was asking about the hockey stick, for example, or what's going on with the sun
407160	408160	and all these kind of things.
408160	415720	And I figure, oh, my gosh, I really need to just step out beyond my personal areas of
415720	422320	expertise and try to understand a lot more of this, which I did.
422320	429240	And eventually the hurricane and global warming issues settled down a little bit.
429240	434480	And then a few years later, climate gates struck.
434480	442560	This was in November of 2009 with the unauthorized release of emails from the University of East
442560	443560	Anglia.
443560	451680	It was a very big scandal at the time, IPCC authors hiding the decline, Mike's nature
451680	454800	trick, all this kind of stuff.
454800	460320	And it was hugely important politically and it's believed to have derailed the Waxman
460320	467440	Markey bill that was making progress towards being passed.
467440	470360	And then this just pretty much derailed it.
470360	478120	And I took the controversial step of saying, we need to do better.
478120	481920	We need to make all of our data publicly available.
481920	484360	We need to make our methods transparent.
484360	490040	We need to pay more attention to uncertainty and be more honest about the level of confidence
490120	492800	we actually have in this stuff.
492800	501280	And we also need to pay attention to skeptics and treat them with respect and pay attention
501280	505200	to their arguments and refute them if they're serious.
505200	510880	And to me, this sounded like motherhood and apple pie kind of thing.
510880	511880	Right, absolutely.
511880	518120	Okay, but the people within the climate community were very angry at me, saying that I needed
518200	523680	to be more sensitive to the feelings of the scientists who were involved.
523680	530880	Excuse me, no one was sensitive to my feelings during the hurricane and global warming wars.
530880	533440	And also, I wasn't worried about their feelings.
533440	542320	I was worried about the IPCC and the credibility of it and what we should be doing about this.
542320	550040	There were much bigger issues at stake here than the feelings of these scientists.
550040	555200	Well, anybody, any scientist who talks to you about whether you're hurting their feelings
555200	560240	when you're launching a discussion of the factual basis of their claims has immediately
560240	562200	stepped outside of the scientific domain.
562200	568400	I mean, one of the things I loved about being a scientist was that the rules of engagement
568400	573200	at professional conferences, let's say, that were genuinely scientific in nature were pretty
573200	574200	damn clear.
574200	582600	I mean, we were discussing the empirical and statistical reliability and validity of your
582600	585120	claims on a technical basis.
585120	586120	That was that.
586120	587800	And if we weren't doing that, it wasn't science.
587800	592960	And so the idea that what you should be attending to when you're criticizing someone's work,
592960	596880	which doesn't mean denigrating it, it means trying to separate the wheat from the chaff,
596880	597880	by the way.
597880	603440	It has nothing to do with your regard for the emotional well-being of your, say, antagonist.
603440	607560	I mean, you could be polite and that's helpful, but it's also not mandatory.
607560	608560	Right.
608560	613040	But well, there's a subtlety here because I was not so much criticizing the substance
613040	620640	of the science, but the behavior of the scientists that I felt violated the norms of science
620640	632320	in terms of everybody, universalism, everybody should have a chance or a shot at the data.
632320	640320	We should listen to skeptics and we should try to keep politics out of our science to
640320	642000	the extent that we can.
642000	646120	I mean, these are the kind of behaviors.
646120	652360	These emails reveal people trying to get editors fired, playing fast and loose with
652360	660520	the guidelines of the IPCC, evade Freedom of Information Act requests from people they
660520	662340	thought would challenge their research.
662340	667640	This kind of behavior that I strenuously objected to and I thought that we should not defend
667640	668720	and we should call out.
668720	672760	So I was not challenging the substance of anybody's science.
672760	678480	It was really the behavior in the public debate on climate.
678480	679480	Right.
679480	682920	Well, that is a form of, that is a form in some sense of methodological criticism.
682920	683920	Yes.
683920	689680	I mean, your point was that there's rules to the investigative process and the communication
689680	694880	process and politicization breaks those rules and the response on the front of the climate
694880	700000	apocalypse, let's say, you see this with biologists who are concerned about extinction from time
700000	706400	to time too, is that, well, this issue is so important that it's unethical to abide by
706400	710760	those normative principles because we need to do everything we can to draw as much attention
710760	716080	to this looming catastrophe as possible and in some sense, all is fair in love and war.
716080	721440	And that would be fine if they were correct and 100% correct possibly, although I still
721440	725280	think they're violating the science politics distinction.
725280	730800	But when there's doubt and there's substantial doubt here, then that's a real problem.
730800	734960	I wanted to take apart some of the things you said, so you came at this in a very interesting
734960	739640	way in some sense because the first time that you rose to something approximating public
739640	744880	prominence, you were actually putting forth a set of propositions that you could argue
744880	751360	supported a more dire view of climate outcome, making the claim that these hurricanes, severe
751360	753420	hurricanes had increased in frequency.
753420	758680	Do you believe now that have they continued to increase in frequency or was that a momentary
758680	759680	spike?
759680	760680	Do you know that literature still?
760680	761680	Oh, yes.
761680	767800	Okay, first off, there were lots of potshots thrown at us.
767800	770920	The couple of criticisms turned out to be valid.
770920	777200	One is that the global data before 1985 is pretty dodgy.
777200	784360	We went back to 1970, so realistically, you have to throw out 15 years.
784360	790960	And the other thing was looking at just the natural variability and could we really distinguish
790960	794480	a warming signal from the natural variability?
794480	798240	And at this point, we still can't with a lot of confidence.
798240	804840	Yeah, well, a big part of the problem here is what time frame over, this is a huge problem
804920	806880	and I don't even know how you solve it in some sense.
806880	813920	If you're trying to define something like a trend towards cooling or warming or increased
813920	818280	or decreased variability, the question that immediately arises, well, are you talking
818280	823200	about a hundred years or a thousand or 10,000 or a million, like there's an infinite number
823200	825160	of time frames to consider and-
825160	828360	Exactly, that is a key challenge.
828360	834400	And one of my major themes coming out of the climate gate thing was a more serious look
834400	836200	at uncertainty.
836200	841920	And I wrote a paper called Climate Change and the Uncertainty Monster.
841920	849560	And I used that paper, a series of, you know, to launch my blog, Climate Etc, JudithCarré.com
849560	852000	in 2010.
852000	859840	And again, this was people outside the clique of establishment climate scientists thought
859840	860840	this was great.
860840	861840	This is important.
861840	862840	This is obvious.
862880	868800	However, within the clique, they viewed me as trying to destroy a consensus that they
868800	871240	had been trying to build for 20 years.
871240	878320	Well, this manufactured consensus and it was on very flimsy ground, you know, and there
878320	879320	was no-
879320	883080	Okay, how would you characterize that so-called consensus?
883080	884800	Is that associated with this idea?
884800	889080	I talked to Richard Frenzen about this recently.
889080	894840	Is that associated with the idea that like 97% of scientists agree that, well, it isn't
894840	899520	clear what they agree, that's the issue, is that climate change is a severe and catastrophic
899520	903920	problem, which is that statement in itself is not true by any stretch of the imagination.
903920	905680	What's the consensus here?
905680	911880	Okay, the issue is the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
911880	917480	They did their first assessment report in like 1991 and following that, I mean, that was
917480	918480	a good report.
918520	920800	There was a good assessment at the time.
920800	926720	And then the powers that be says we need to strive for consensus in our statements.
926720	931640	And so this sort of narrowed the framing and the people they were picking to be on the
931640	934360	committee were people who were all going to agree.
934360	939800	And so they were working to manufacture a consensus.
939800	945680	You know, it was their view of how the policy process deals with uncertainty.
945680	951560	So it was sort of a speaking consensus to power approach.
951560	955000	And this was like formalized by the IPCC.
955000	962720	And you know, people challenging the consensus, and there's many dimensions to it, but the
962720	970760	most fundamental one is that most of the warming that we've seen since 1950 is caused by humans.
970760	974880	I mean, that's the most central consensus statement.
974920	979280	There is warming, that there is warming, even though now the narrative has changed, that
979280	980760	there is warming.
980760	983240	There's a certain idea about its potential magnitude.
983240	988800	And then hypothetically, the consensus is that what, about 50% of that is to do human
988800	989800	activity?
989800	996720	No, they used to make the statement more than half, but they really meant 100%.
996720	1003040	But there's certainly no scientific consensus that 100% of the global warming that's occurring
1003040	1005120	at the moment is anthropogenic.
1005120	1006120	I don't believe it.
1006120	1010680	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, there isn't a scientific, okay.
1010680	1011680	There's no measure.
1011680	1020840	I mean, when you have a complex, highly uncertain situation like this, the issue of consensus
1020840	1022640	is scientifically meaningless.
1022640	1031160	It's only meaningful, you know, for political purposes, this whole idea of speaking consensus
1031280	1036840	to power, that that was some pathway, you know, to policymaking, it hasn't really turned
1036840	1039840	out to be.
1039840	1044920	Yeah, so, yeah, there's no consensus, the most recent...
1044920	1052200	Well, it's also a preposterous claim scientifically, because the way science works is that a great
1052200	1057040	scientist is the first person who challenges the consensus.
1057040	1058920	That's kind of how you define a great scientist.
1059160	1063880	One of the things that's so wonderful about science is that it can reveal when the universal
1063880	1067000	consensus is wrong.
1067000	1070440	And it's powerful in its methods precisely because of that.
1070440	1074280	And you know that as a practicing researcher, is that the probability that you're going
1074280	1081000	to do a study and that the data is going to reveal the consensus of your lab's theory,
1081000	1085560	the validity of the consensus of your lab's theory is basically zero.
1085640	1089640	So, the idea that something unexpected is going to crop up when you actually test your
1089640	1091640	idea against reality itself.
1091640	1094640	So, the idea that science is consensus-based is...
1094640	1095640	It's wrong.
1095640	1096640	It's wrong.
1096640	1100640	It's amazing that the idea got anywhere.
1100640	1103640	Okay, look at the social factors in play.
1103640	1112640	Okay, there was a big drive by the UN to deal with human, you know, dangerous anthropogenic
1112640	1113640	climate change.
1113720	1119720	It was a 1992 treaty before we even had any evidence of human cause warming at all.
1119720	1120720	Okay?
1120720	1124920	And then you had scientists become invested in this, you know, in their career goals and
1124920	1129440	the funding that comes into the field and all of this kind of stuff.
1129440	1135720	There was this sort of social contract between the scientists and the policy makers that
1135720	1140000	perpetuated this situation and, you know, and they were...
1140000	1146080	The policy makers, we need, you know, more, you know, we need more and more confident
1146080	1152800	statements from the IPCC even though the dimensions of the problem were growing and growing and
1152800	1158120	growing every year and clearly becoming more complex and obvious that there were a lot
1158120	1160800	of things that we didn't understand.
1160800	1163480	But there was this drive, you know.
1163480	1168360	Well, it's not as if the IPC documents themselves or even that radical.
1168360	1175560	I mean, my understanding of the IPC documents is that the projection is something like one
1175560	1181440	to two degrees of further warming with some increase in variability, especially in the
1181440	1187960	polar regions and a small degree of sea level rise.
1187960	1193840	No indication in the IPCC reports that this will produce runaway out-of-control feedback
1193840	1198200	loops that will have a devastating consequence, no real vision of apocalypse.
1198240	1206400	And so that's not quite correct until, until recently, people were looking at projections
1206400	1212560	of four to five degrees centigrade more warming over the course of the 21st century.
1212560	1222000	OK, the issue was wildly ridiculous emissions projections, which are now believed to be
1222080	1224240	implausible.
1224240	1230840	The more recent IPCC assessment report with more plausible emissions scenarios is looking
1230840	1236520	at more two to three degrees centigrade of warming.
1236520	1241720	And we've already had one degree, so it's an additional one to two degrees centigrade
1241720	1246000	of warming that people expect based on the climate models.
1246000	1253520	So they were pretty alarming up until recently because everyone was focused on this extreme
1253520	1261400	emissions scenario, which is now widely accepted as implausible, if not impossible.
1261400	1266880	So there was a lot of alarm and all the, you know, when you talk about all the projections
1266880	1272200	of extreme weather events and we won't be able to grow wine in California and crazy
1272200	1278000	projections of sea level rise, all these projections were tied to that extreme emissions
1278000	1284760	scenario and it's taken a community a long time to reject it.
1284760	1290840	In fact, this extreme emissions scenario was still the most often, the most widely used
1290840	1298800	in the sixth assessment report, which was published only like two years ago.
1298800	1306560	So I mean, this is still pervasive, these excessively alarming projections of what could
1306560	1315560	happen in the 21st century, mostly driven by implausible to impossible emissions scenario,
1315560	1319360	but also driven by climate models that are running too hot.
1319360	1321760	Okay, let's go into that a bit.
1321760	1327640	So I talked to Richard Linsen about a week ago about the problems with models.
1327640	1333760	He said, for example, that the models are based on cells, let's say, so those would
1333760	1338640	be, the whole earth can't be modeled, so you have to oversimplify it, you have to clump
1338640	1343560	it into chunks, and the chunks are about 70 miles wide, they don't, they can't really
1343560	1345880	model cloud activity very well.
1345880	1350200	There's a lot of error in relationship to projecting and forecasting the effect of
1350200	1352240	water vapor.
1352240	1357000	The models, the models have to build a lot of assumptions in and that doesn't mean that
1357080	1363960	we shouldn't build models, but it does mean that they have very large potential for error,
1363960	1367760	and that error is magnified as you project out into the future.
1367760	1373480	And so I've read, for example, you tell me if you think this is accurate, that our estimates
1373480	1380340	of the cumulative effect of carbon dioxide on global warming or climate change are smaller
1380340	1385960	than our estimates of the magnitude of our error in measuring the effect of water vapor.
1385960	1391320	And that's a big problem because water vapor is a major contributor to warming in principle,
1391320	1396200	and so if carbon dioxide effects are under the size of the error in that measurement,
1396200	1397400	that's really well.
1397400	1402240	Well, I wouldn't put it that way.
1402240	1405840	We have a pretty good idea of how much water vapor is in the atmosphere.
1405840	1410080	The question is, how is that going to change with warming?
1410080	1414480	The bigger issue is the clouds, what clouds are doing.
1414480	1422880	Clouds have a huge, and they're not modeled very well, and the observational basis for
1422880	1427880	understanding how they're trending only goes back a few decades.
1427880	1435280	So that's a tough one, but the net result of these uncertainties in water vapor and
1435280	1442680	cloud feedback is that we don't know how sensitive the climate is to increasing CO2 because
1442680	1449520	the way the models treat it is that CO2 and clouds amplify the warming.
1449520	1454880	And I think the cloud feedback might even be negative.
1454880	1462040	Water vapor does overall amplify the warming, but in the tropics where Richard Linsen has
1462040	1468120	done his research, he proposes that there is a negative feedback, and that's something
1468120	1471880	that's hotly debated, but I think the clouds are the bigger issue.
1471880	1476880	But apart from what's going on in the atmosphere, to me, it's really the oceans and the sun
1476880	1483920	that are the biggest sources of uncertainty in terms of understanding what's going on
1483920	1486880	and be able to project into the future.
1486880	1487880	So there are...
1487880	1488880	Okay, why the oceans?
1488880	1489880	Oh my goodness.
1489880	1500340	Okay, the oceans have these large circulation systems overturning El Niño, La Niña.
1500340	1501800	People are familiar with that.
1501800	1505160	That's a mode of natural internal variability.
1505160	1513040	There's also decadal and multi-decadal oscillation cycles that change the patterns of clouds,
1513040	1518480	the whole patterns of sea surface temperature, influence of snowfall on Greenland, the Arctic,
1518480	1524440	sea ice, rainfall, regional climates, et cetera, and the models don't treat these very well.
1524440	1530520	There's a whole spectrum of these ocean circulations all on out to 10,000 years.
1530520	1535120	You have millennial scale overturning that influences the climate.
1535120	1543440	And the models have far too little power in that part of the spectrum.
1543440	1545440	So we're just missing that.
1545440	1547820	And so is that a consequence?
1547820	1554680	Does that mean that the degree to which the ocean takes up carbon dioxide is permeated
1554680	1556760	by error in measurement?
1556760	1561920	Is it also an indication of our lack of understanding of how the temperature of the ocean itself
1561920	1566280	is regulated by the motion of water from the depths up to the top?
1566280	1567280	All of that?
1567280	1568280	Oh, yeah.
1568280	1569480	Is that where the error is?
1569480	1570980	Well, no.
1570980	1576640	Vertical transport of heat and carbon in the ocean is part of the consequences of the uncertainty
1576640	1579480	in these large-scale circulations.
1579480	1581920	But more fundamentally, these large-scale...
1581920	1586480	They change the weather patterns and change the clouds, among other things.
1586480	1593840	So this is trying to get all that modeled right, let alone making credible predictions
1593840	1594840	into the future.
1594840	1599440	We're not there, not even close to being there.
1599440	1605600	And then once you get into the sun, it's even crazier.
1605600	1614600	The IPCC has pretty much dismissed the role of the sun in the last 150 years.
1614600	1620760	But the interesting thing is that in the Six Assessment Report, Chapter 6, they finally
1620760	1626840	acknowledged the great uncertainty in the amount of solar forcing in the late 20th century.
1626840	1635240	And this arises from there was a gap in the satellites measuring the sun output that occur
1635240	1642820	at the time of the Challenger shuttle disaster, if you recall that.
1642820	1647460	And so one solar sensor was running out, and they were supposed to launch another one,
1647460	1652740	but all the launches were put off for a number of years until they sorted out what was going
1652740	1656420	on at NASA with the launches and everything.
1656420	1664700	So there's this so-called gap, and depending on what was actually happening in that gap,
1664700	1670260	you can tune the solar variability to high variability or low variability.
1670260	1676380	So all the climate models are being run with low solar variability forcing, but for the
1676380	1682900	first time, Chapter 2 in the observational chapter of the Six Assessment Report acknowledged
1682900	1686660	this issue that there is huge amount of variability.
1686660	1692180	And this doesn't even factor in the so-called solar indirect effects in terms of there's
1692180	1698820	a lot of it's not just the heat from the sun, there's a lot of issues related to ultraviolet
1698820	1704180	and stratosphere and cosmic rays and magnetic fields and all these other things that really
1704180	1705940	aren't being factored in.
1705940	1709700	They're at the forefront of research, but they're certainly not factored into the climate
1709700	1710700	models.
1710700	1719140	So there are so many uncertainties out there that affect certainly the projections of what
1719140	1725540	might happen in the 21st century, but also our interpretation of what's been going on
1725540	1734660	with the climate for the last 100 years ago and exactly what's been causing what.

1801900	1806580	So I would say that those who object to the line of reasoning that you're putting forward,
1806580	1809620	I believe would make an argument analogous to the following.
1809620	1814980	They would say, well, look, we have, despite all the objections on the measurement front,
1814980	1817740	we have pretty good evidence that there's a warming trend.
1817740	1822260	We have reasonable evidence that at least a reasonable proportion of that is a consequence
1822260	1827020	of anthropogenic activity, most particularly the production of carbon dioxide.
1827020	1833540	The potential consequence of this could be apocalyptic 100 years down the road or 50
1833540	1835500	years down the road.
1835500	1840380	Even with all those doubts in mind, it's incumbent upon us to take something like emergency
1840380	1846740	action now so that we ameliorate this risk of apocalyptic transformation.
1846740	1851540	And so this is just obstructionist hand waving your objections.
1851540	1857540	And if you were moral and on board, you'd see that this issue is so serious and so apocalyptic
1857540	1861300	that it's inappropriate to stand in the way of the amelioration.
1861300	1864860	And so what do you think about that as a counter proposition?
1865060	1871100	OK, the weakest part of their argument is whether all this is dangerous.
1871100	1875140	The sea level rise is creeping up.
1875140	1884020	The ice cap, Greenland, Antarctic, it changes from year to year with a little bit of melting,
1884020	1888020	but there's no catastrophe looming on those fronts.
1888020	1890580	And so they've turned to extreme weather.
1890820	1892300	Oh, global warming is calling.
1892300	1897420	And I have to say, the hurricane and global warming first put this idea into their head.
1897420	1903740	Ah, you know, if we can show that even one degree can cause something bad, like more
1903740	1907500	category five hurricanes, then we have something.
1907500	1914220	So this started this whole trend of every extreme weather event is associated with human
1914220	1917460	cause global warming, which just isn't true.
1917460	1924700	And if you look back, and they tend to go back to 1970 or 1950, oh, this is the warmest
1924700	1930180	year, the worst storm or the biggest drought or whatever since 1970, maybe since 1950.
1930180	1937420	But if you look into the first half of the 20th century, the weather was way worse, certainly
1937420	1943500	in North America and over much of the globe also.
1943500	1950980	Right now in the U.S. West, we're being assaulted by these atmospheric river events, bringing
1950980	1959460	huge amounts of rain and snow, which is going to cause flooding, it's still snow yet.
1959460	1964020	And you know, this is horrible, global warming and everything like that.
1964020	1979220	But if you go back to the winter of 1861 and 1862, 15 inches of rain fell in central California
1979220	1985420	over a period of a couple of months, which huge floods over a very widespread area that
1985420	1988420	lasted for absolute months.
1988420	1994780	And paleo climate evidence showed that these tend to happen about every 200 years or so,
1994780	1998940	where you have this massive accumulation of these atmospheric rivers.
1998940	2001780	So this is nothing at all unusual.
2001780	2007540	So if you look back into the historical record or better yet, the paleo climate record, invariably
2007540	2010660	you will find worse weather events.
2010660	2016060	So that's part of the timeframe problem, right, is like, well, over what span do you evaluate
2016060	2018500	these events before you draw your conclusions?
2018500	2019500	But you can't...
2019500	2020700	So do you believe it?
2020700	2026780	Do you believe that any of the tipping point hypotheses, Franzen told me something interesting.
2026780	2029260	This was kind of a technical proposition.
2029260	2034900	He said that in complex systems with many degrees of freedom on the entropy front, so many ways
2034900	2041460	they can potentially react, the probability of a tipping point positive feedback loop,
2041460	2045700	you know, like the runaway global warming or something like that, the melting of the
2045700	2051340	Greenland ice caps, because we hit a tipping point, said in complex systems that have multiple
2051340	2056540	potential outcomes, that kind of all or none tipping point is unlikely.
2056540	2061340	You get that more likely in a simple system that's characterized by the probability of
2061340	2064820	radical state change, like water freezing, for example.
2064820	2069140	And so I thought that I can't evaluate that argument, you know, it's outside my domain
2069140	2073700	of scientific competence, but it struck me as an interesting idea.
2073700	2082140	Well, to some extent, it's true, there is one sort of tipping point that we could encounter,
2082140	2088120	and if this does happen, I would expect that human-caused global warming would play only
2088120	2094660	a small part, and this is the West Antarctic ice sheet, which is an unstable ice sheet.
2094660	2098900	So if you took the ice sheet away, the continent would actually be under water.
2098900	2104500	But what it is, you have this huge ice sheet that sits on the continent and part of it's
2104500	2109220	above water, okay, and it has an overhang.
2109220	2116820	And this is just a dynamically unstable situation, and it moves fairly fast.
2116820	2124780	Underneath this ice sheet are lots of inactive volcanoes, even the occasional active volcanoes.
2124780	2129940	So if these volcanoes became active and we had, you know, a greater heat source under
2129940	2139100	this, combined with sea level rise and a little bit of global warming, this could accelerate.
2139100	2145020	And on the time scale of, you know, three or four centuries, we could see this collapse,
2145020	2149220	you know, which could lead to a substantial sea level rise.
2149220	2154460	So that's the one kind, you know, if we saw that happening, are there engineering ways
2154460	2156060	of dealing with it?
2156060	2162060	I don't know, but it was something that would be a slow process, but that's the only one
2162060	2170380	of the so-called tipping points that I see could happen, because, you know, if there's
2170380	2175820	going to be some solid earth, you know, if the earth wants to have an earthquake or big
2175820	2180780	volcanic eruption, you know, there aren't a lot of, you know, negative feedbacks in
2180780	2182780	the earth system to prevent that.
2182780	2190860	So to me, that's the one, like, bad thing that could happen, but it would take centuries.
2190860	2195060	But the other ones, you know, I don't see it.
2195060	2200700	So what do you think, when you look at the IPCC reports now and you look 50 years ahead
2200700	2208140	or 100 years ahead, what would you regard as a credible representation of the so-called
2208140	2210540	climate science?
2210540	2216700	Do you accept the new IPC prognostications, or do you think the models are so error-ridden
2216700	2222740	that even the hypothesis of one to two degrees warming isn't reliable enough, even though
2222740	2223940	it's the best we have?
2224220	2231180	Well, the interesting thing is that the IPCC Six Assessment Report, Working Group One,
2231180	2235660	they also sort of rejected the climate models to some extent.
2235660	2241580	They were guided by them in their projections, but they also, you know, defined a plausible
2241580	2245980	range of climate sensitivity and looked at the projections from there.
2245980	2251500	So even the IPCC is stepping back from the global climate models as being useful for
2251500	2257220	projections, and people are going to these climate emulators, these simple climate models.
2257220	2263340	Well, for this amount of warming, you know, run it through a damage model or an economic
2263340	2265380	assessment model or something like that.
2265380	2269500	So people are really stepping back from these big global climate models, and it's about
2269500	2271020	time.
2271020	2279340	And one of the innovations that I've been undertaking in my projection work, and this
2279340	2286100	is what I do for clients of my company, Climate Forecast Applications Network, is that I
2286100	2287260	look at it.
2287260	2293500	I don't just look at the IPCC scenarios, and I choose the low-end ones, because I think
2293500	2298260	those are more credible, but I also look at scenarios of what the ocean circulations
2298260	2306180	could be doing, you know, scenarios of volcanic eruptions and solar variation scenarios and
2306180	2311980	try to put forward a broader range of what we might be looking at.
2311980	2317900	And so I have like a network-based approach to combine all this and to producing a much
2317900	2320060	broader range of scenarios.
2320060	2325700	And at least over the next three decades, like the natural variability piece of this
2325700	2332260	is pointing towards cooling rather than amplifying the warming, you know, it would tamp down
2332260	2338220	the global warming of whatever magnitude it is from fossil fuel emissions.
2338220	2340380	So that's the approach that I'm taking.
2340380	2342540	Okay, so let's go into that a bit.
2342540	2351060	You earlier, you indicated that you left the university in 2017 to pursue an entrepreneurial
2351060	2358260	activity that you had initiated at Georgia Tech, and you just made allusion to that again.
2358260	2366220	So tell me, if you would, how you are modeling, and you've laid out some of the conclusions,
2366220	2368980	but who's interested in your models?
2368980	2373300	And obviously, you're doing this on an entrepreneurial basis, so people are willing to pay you for
2373300	2378660	your opinion, which gives, I think, some, what would you say, indication of their faith
2378660	2384500	in its credibility, because people are actually spending money on it, like how are your models
2384500	2390460	different than the models that are more broadly publicized, let's say?
2390460	2394180	And who is it that is paying you to produce these models?
2394180	2395700	Why is there interest in that?
2395700	2397180	And why are they doing it?
2397180	2404620	Okay, well, insurance companies, financial institutions have an interest in Atlantic
2404620	2406120	hurricanes.
2406120	2411340	What are we looking at over the next three decades in terms of Atlantic hurricane activity?
2411340	2417660	A big issue is a potential shift to the cold phase of the Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation.
2417660	2424540	This is one of those multi-decadal oscillations that I talked about, which we would expect
2424540	2429700	would start to tamp down the Atlantic hurricane activity.
2429700	2431780	So this is a very big deal for them.
2431780	2439860	Another client was Wind Farm owners who wanted to know, is the wind going to keep blowing
2439860	2443460	for the next 30 years, and are my wind farms in the right location?
2443460	2446780	Okay, they wanted to know that.
2446780	2454580	Some electric utilities want to know, what could we be looking at in terms of, like,
2454580	2462180	how frequent these really bad situations could be for renewable power, like a massive cold
2462180	2467060	air outbreak that lasts for weeks, the wind doesn't blow, and it's wintertime and there's
2467060	2468780	no sun.
2468780	2473700	How bad can it get, and how frequently might these occur?
2473700	2479380	So these are some of the things that I've been looking at, and also people interested
2479380	2487940	in sea level rise projections in their particular location, looking at scenarios of what their
2487940	2488940	location.
2488940	2497380	A lot of interest from people in Florida, San Francisco, along the Atlantic coast.
2497380	2499260	What could we be looking at?
2499260	2506740	We see that those projections from the IPCC, which of those should we believe, but we already
2506740	2512140	know that, you know, how are the ocean circulation patterns going to influence their local sea
2512140	2513860	level rise?
2513860	2526420	What kind of trends do I see for the vertical land motion, both from local effects and large
2527420	2532700	more planetary scale up and down, kind of effects.
2532700	2537980	So those are some of the projects that I've been working on, looking at scenarios out,
2537980	2542260	say, 30 to 50 years.

2605220	2610020	So why do these companies believe that your models are credible enough for them to pour
2610020	2615100	economic resources into, and why do you believe that your models are credible enough to provide
2615100	2616100	them with accurate guidance?
2616100	2620940	I mean, we talked about some of the limitations of models, and so what is it that you're doing
2620940	2626060	that is credible to the companies, and why do you believe scientifically that you're
2626060	2627740	providing accurate information?
2627740	2628740	Okay.
2628740	2636660	The first thing that I did, and I did this before most other people did, I said, look,
2636660	2641500	you're wasting your time looking at that extreme emissions scenario.
2641500	2650380	If you look at the international energy agency, their scenarios show emissions being fairly
2650380	2657700	flat for the next several decades, and I think this is a much more plausible scenario.
2657700	2664080	So let's focus on that one, and this is apart from trying to predict what policy is going
2664080	2669400	to do and how much you're going to change, but the thinking is now that emissions are
2669400	2676240	going to stay fairly flat for the next few decades, and I saw this, and I saw the journal
2676240	2679560	publications, and this is what I was pushing to my client.
2679560	2683760	If you want something realistic, this is what you should be looking at.
2683760	2695480	The other thing is not accepting the extremely high values of climate sensitivity to CO2
2695480	2696480	doubling.
2696480	2702880	I don't go as low as Richard Linsen does, but I'm certainly on the low end, and I justify
2702880	2709600	why to them, based on publications, including some of my own, why we shouldn't be looking
2709600	2713360	at these very high sensitivity values.
2713480	2720120	I run it through a range so they can look, but I'm saying, so I give them all the scenarios
2720120	2721120	they want.
2721120	2727720	I'll give the high emission scenario, I'll give the high climate sensitivity, low climate
2727720	2735200	sensitivity, I'll say my best judgment is that this is what it is, but then I uniquely
2735200	2740920	put in scenarios of the natural variability, and they really like this.
2740920	2747880	They get it, they've seen it, and they understand it's out there, they've just never seen anybody
2747880	2752080	try to project it before, and I have publications on this.
2752080	2756640	They can parameterize their risk given your plethora of models.
2756640	2763120	Here's the worst case scenario, here's the likely scenario, here's the range, and then
2763120	2769640	they can calculate how to mitigate their risk across those scenarios.
2769640	2770640	Exactly.
2770880	2773920	A lot of times they want to know, well, what's the worst case?
2773920	2775920	What's the worst plausible case?
2775920	2782520	Okay, and so I give them that, and so they have this whole range, okay, so for example,
2782520	2790040	in the wind farm profitability study, I gave them 81 scenarios, different scenarios of
2790040	2799480	how this could play out over the next 30 years, and there was a cluster of scenarios in a
2799480	2806800	certain area, and I say, you might infer that these are the most plausible outcomes
2806800	2813920	because there's multiple different pathways for reaching that, but here's your plausible
2813920	2821880	worst case, here's your plausible best case, and this gives them some information for making
2821880	2825640	their decision.
2825640	2832400	So you admit right up front in some sense that there are inputs into your models that
2832400	2838280	are somewhat arbitrary, that you have to decide about, and those might be, for example, your
2838280	2845560	projections of carbon dioxide output, and then you say, given a variety of initial assumptions,
2845560	2851800	here's a variety of outcomes, but a lot of the models tend to converge at this vision,
2851800	2856680	this range of visions, and so if the convergence of multiple models constitutes evidence, which
2856680	2862080	we generally assume it does, then this seems to be the most plausible pathway, right, and
2862080	2864960	so how does that differ from the IPCC approach?
2864960	2870320	Okay, well, I don't say it's the more, well, first they neglect all the elements of natural
2870320	2875920	variability that I conclude, they're not giving scenarios of volcanic eruptions, they're not
2875920	2890160	giving different scenarios of sun activity, they have a bunch of different scenarios of
2890160	2896680	what the internal ocean variability is doing, but I can anchor it more closely to what the
2896680	2902920	observations are in my own network model in terms of what the plausible trajectories are,
2902920	2913560	so I'm giving them a more plausible trajectory for the ocean oscillations, and generally,
2913560	2920480	going out 30 years, these other scenarios are cooler than the IPCC scenarios.
2920480	2928200	Well, and so, and do they actually point to cooling or just less rapid warming?
2928200	2933440	Some of them go as far as cooling, okay, and others are less rapid warming, and there've
2933440	2939920	been another publications, you never see them publicize, that show for certain combinations
2939920	2947800	of these ocean circulations or volcanic eruptions or solar activity that you could see cooling
2947800	2954600	for a decade or two during the 21st century, that could happen.
2954600	2961640	When the IPCC AR6 did, if you read the fine print deep in the chapters, you'll see these
2961640	2970200	papers referenced and it is acknowledged, but it's not something that you hear in the
2970200	2975000	public debate, it's just this relentless warming that we're going to be seeing.
2975000	2983240	Okay, so that's interesting because the warming advocates are doubtful enough about their
2983240	2989000	own prognostication so that it's no longer appropriate to refer to global warming, you're
2989000	2994480	supposed to refer to climate change, which I think is a terrible sleight of hand, but
2994480	2996480	in any case, that's what's happened.
2996480	3002880	But nonetheless, the apocalyptic prognostications are still predicated on this idea of warming.
3002880	3008440	Now your claim is that the consensus that that might be apocalyptic was never there to
3008440	3013720	begin with and the initial estimates of the magnitude of warming were out by about a factor
3013720	3020760	of two, partly because people accepted equally apocalyptic in some sense prognostications
3020760	3023280	of carbon dioxide output.
3023280	3029880	But then you're taking that further, you're saying that the models are so prone to variability
3029880	3035720	that there is some non-trivial possibility that there'll be a global cooling trend over
3035720	3038520	the next 30 years instead of a global warming trend.
3038520	3044960	And so in the face of all that, someone might ask themselves, well, if the situation with
3044960	3053040	regards to these models is as uncertain as you suggest, and also it's interesting just
3053040	3057800	as soon as I decide that financial companies will pay you for your prognostications, which
3057800	3064560	is another form of validation of your opinion, why in the world are we stampeding madly to
3064560	3070480	spend untold, literally trillions of dollars trying to ameliorate a problem that we haven't
3070480	3072160	properly measured?
3072160	3074720	Like what's going on here as far as you can tell?
3074720	3075720	Okay.
3075720	3076720	You have to go back.
3076720	3077720	Okay.
3077720	3085880	The policy cart has been way out in front of the scientific course from the very beginning.
3085880	3093000	In the 1980s, the UN environmental program was looking for something.
3093000	3094160	We hate capitalism.
3094160	3095880	We don't like the oil companies.
3095880	3099000	We like world government, all this kind of thing.
3099000	3107320	And they latched on to the climate change, the CO2 global warming is what it was called
3107320	3108320	back then.
3108320	3114760	And this ceded the formation of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.
3114760	3121720	And there was a treaty signed by 192 nations in 1992, including the US.
3121720	3123760	This was before we knew anything.
3123760	3131300	We were to avoid dangerous anthropogenic climate change before we had any idea of any of this.
3131300	3140360	And so this frame, the climate problem, in a very narrow frame, a lot of climate is now
3140360	3145120	caused by CO2 and by definition warming is dangerous.
3145120	3148400	Why was that such an attractive political hypothesis?
3148400	3155160	Why did politicians decide that in the absence of this stringently produced scientific evidence
3155160	3161200	that the proper place for the world's political community to focus was on the cardinal danger
3161200	3164320	of global warming that was anthropogenically produced?
3164320	3168360	Like, what the hell is going on there, especially because it's so expensive?
3168360	3169360	Okay.
3169360	3171800	Well, people didn't pay much attention to it for decades.
3171800	3177800	I mean, the Kyoto Protocol, a bunch of countries in 1997, a bunch of countries signed on to
3177800	3179640	reduce their emissions.
3179640	3184040	But even the ones who signed on didn't really reduce their emissions, and of course the US
3184040	3185440	never signed on.
3185440	3188200	And reduced its emissions weirdly enough.
3188200	3189440	So that's pretty funny.
3189440	3190760	I know.
3190760	3197800	And it wasn't really until the Paris Agreement that they came up with this more voluntary
3197800	3199320	thing.
3199400	3206240	Then they started phrasing it, and there was a spate of bad weather, big El Nino and stuff
3206240	3213680	like that, that they latched onto this extreme, if we'd just got rid of all this, the weather
3213680	3214680	would be nicer.
3214680	3220160	We'd get rid of all these floods and droughts and hurricanes and whatever else and heatwaves
3220160	3222720	that was plaguing humanity.
3222720	3227440	And so people bought that kind of simple argument.
3227440	3233600	And then once, there was a real shift in 2018.
3233600	3240640	After the Paris Agreement, the rhetoric was climate crisis, climate emergency from the
3240640	3248240	world leaders, the UN, President Obama, Macron, Merkel, all of these leaders saying this.
3248240	3252600	But in 2018, people started paying attention.
3252600	3263200	And this is when Gretta Thunberg came onto the scene, and she's a remarkable person.
3263200	3268520	She's wrong, a lot of things, but a remarkable person nevertheless.
3268520	3274360	But what she was doing spawned the sunrise movement, extinction, rebellion, all this
3274360	3275960	kind of stuff.
3275960	3282640	And the journalists amplified this, the climate crisis, the climate emergency.
3282640	3288880	Ten years ago, climate, even ten years ago, climate change was like really a fringe topic.
3288880	3293600	At journals, now major media outlets have a climate desk, you know, I have a whole team
3293600	3302800	of journalists and there's huge money going into things like carbon brief, things that
3302800	3305360	focus specifically on climate change.
3305360	3308200	And so it's just exploded.
3308200	3313240	And again, there's this social contract between the policy makers, the media and the scientists.
3313240	3316000	It's great for the science, there's nobody.
3316000	3321560	Ten years ago, people with a PhD in climate science, you know, would be trying to get
3321560	3323880	a postdoc and whatever.
3323880	3326320	And now the universities can't even hang onto them.
3326320	3330440	There's so many jobs in the media and the private sector that, you know, this is just
3330440	3331840	a hot thing.
3331840	3338560	Every university now has some sort of climate-y department, institute.
3338560	3340240	It's just big business for everybody.
3340240	3346240	And so there's this mutual reinforcement between the scientists, the policy makers and the media.
3346240	3349800	So that's where the positive feedback loops are, from the tipping point.
3349800	3352120	Right, they're on the sociological side.
3352120	3353680	Yeah, definitely, definitely.
3353680	3356200	Yeah, well, it's quite something to behold.
3356200	3360240	So now what has been the consequences?
3360240	3364680	I mean, you've been pilloried, I believe, I don't believe I'm overstating this, you've
3364680	3370480	been pilloried or satirized as a sort of fringe figure on the client denial front.
3370480	3372560	I think that's fair to say.
3372560	3378600	And it's pretty easy to smear someone with tactics like that, and it's psychologically
3378600	3379600	very effective.
3379600	3385280	I mean, what has it, you know, you said you rose to public prominence partly because you
3385280	3390720	formulated an argument, at least to begin with, that could be latched onto by the climate
3390720	3393520	apocalypse, and quite effectively.
3393520	3401600	But then you produced all sorts of other material, mitigating, producing a mitigated view.
3401600	3405600	What's been the consequence for you of being involved in this?
3405600	3411200	Okay, let me tell you what my sin was.
3411200	3413640	People don't object to my science.
3413640	3420360	I mean, I'm within, you know, the likely range of the IPCC for the most part on the
3420360	3421360	low end.
3421360	3428240	But, you know, it's not fringe perspectives, and I commonly cite the IPCC.
3428240	3435120	What happened, the reason I was shuffled off into denier camp is because I criticized
3435120	3438320	the behavior of climate scientists.
3438320	3446160	I criticized the IPCC for some ethical violations, as well as not paying enough attention to
3446160	3447160	uncertainty.
3447160	3449880	So that was my sin, okay?
3449880	3455560	I offended and criticized the grand poobahs of the climate community.
3455560	3463720	And then I was very quick, and most importantly, in 2011, I criticized Michael Mann's hockey
3463720	3470200	stick on my blog, and then he started calling me a denier, and that was really the beginning
3470200	3471200	of the end.
3471200	3472200	So my sin...
3472200	3475840	Yeah, so let's talk about that terminology for a second, just so everybody knows.
3475840	3482240	So this is quite the rhetorical move on the part of the climate purveyors of apocalyptic
3482240	3483240	doom.
3483240	3488840	And so we already established in our society, broadly speaking in the West, that to object
3488840	3494160	to the idea that the Holocaust was a historical reality puts you outside the pale of normative
3494160	3496760	and reasonable political discussion.
3496760	3501800	And so you can be a Holocaust denier, and if you are such a creature, then you're lumped
3501800	3506560	in with the Nazis and put on the shelf for no further contact, right?
3506560	3508800	You've entered the realm of the reprehensible.
3508800	3513440	Now one of the most effective rhetorical moves of the people who are making a great living
3513560	3519320	or putting themselves forward morally as climate apocalyptic doomsayers was to target
3519320	3524680	people who objected to their views with terminology that was derived directly from that rhetorical
3524680	3525680	move.
3525680	3531080	So now if you're a climate change denier, the connotation is you're occupied the same
3531080	3537240	category morally as people who refuse to believe on the grounds of their appalling anti-Semitism
3537240	3542200	and their blind historical ignorance that the Holocaust was a historical reality.
3542200	3547040	And so in some sense, there's no real difference between labeling someone a climate change
3547040	3550880	denier and labeling them a Nazi enabler.
3550880	3554360	And the rhetorical move was designed precisely to produce that outcome.
3554360	3557120	And so I'm not a big fan of that kind of rhetorical move.
3557120	3561200	And let's talk about Michael Mann for a second too now, because a lot of people listening
3561200	3564720	and watching, they're not going to know what that hockey stick graph was.
3564720	3570200	And they don't know what cardinal role, the scandal around that graph has produced in
3570200	3571200	the discussion.
3571200	3573760	Do you want to walk through the hockey stick graph a little bit?
3573760	3574760	Okay.
3574760	3583440	If you go back to 2001, this was the release of the third assessment report from the IPCC.
3583440	3589320	And Sir John Houghton, who was the head of the IPCC, was giving the press release.
3589320	3596920	And the backdrop behind him was this image, a curve that looked like a hockey stick, which
3596920	3602760	was meant to portray that the climate was very stable for the last thousand years.
3602760	3610840	And all of a sudden, you've got this big uptick that is caused by humans.
3610840	3616640	And this was based on the work of Michael Mann, who was a recent PhD.
3616640	3619520	This was his postdoc work.
3619520	3627200	Before the ink was dry on his PhD, he was appointed a lead author of the IPCC, which
3627200	3631200	was a fairly unusual move to appoint someone.
3631200	3632400	That's an insane move.
3632400	3635760	Let me let everybody watching and listening know.
3635760	3642840	Your PhD is putting your foot or your toe in the water of scientific endeavor.
3642840	3650320	So Judith has 190 publications, and just so those of you who are listening know, generally
3650320	3655920	speaking, a PhD thesis requires approximately as much work as three scientific publications
3655920	3658600	if it's a high quality PhD.
3658600	3665600	And so when you get your PhD, you've entered the domain of genuine scientific contribution.
3665600	3667720	The PhD is actually a marker of that.
3667720	3673080	And if you do a postdoc, that means that you have the opportunity to do a little bit more
3673080	3678200	research work to establish your credibility now as a more independent researcher who isn't
3678200	3680960	dependent on the ideas of your supervisor.
3680960	3682080	So you're a neophyte.
3682080	3684960	You're a beginner when you do a PhD and a postdoc.
3684960	3689280	And maybe you have to do one or maybe two, and then maybe you can get hired as a junior
3689280	3690280	professor.
3690280	3692320	But you're by no means at the peak of your career.
3692320	3698640	And it's very, very rare for initiatory research that might be done at the PhD level to be
3698640	3705240	regarded as canonical unless you're a Nobel Prize-winning genius by the scientific community.
3705240	3710000	And so the fact that man's work got so much attention, even though it was done at this
3710000	3714480	initial level of scientific investigation, I mean, that doesn't speak to its validity.
3714480	3717880	But my point is it's an aberration in the process.
3717880	3721000	And it also points to this problem we discussed earlier of timeframe.
3721000	3726640	I mean, when you construct graphs, you can play with their psychological impact in all
3726640	3728440	sorts of inappropriate ways.
3728440	3731320	You can expand and contract the timeframe.
3731320	3734920	You can expand and contract the scale on the left.
3734920	3740400	And you can make what's really a small effect across some historical span of time look big
3740400	3743680	by playing with the scale.
3743680	3749120	And you can make an effect that isn't very large, temporally speaking, by shrinking the
3749120	3750720	timescale of evaluation.
3750760	3758520	So the man's graph showed this uptick in climate transformation that was attendant on human
3758520	3759960	industrial activity.
3759960	3766600	But he picked a very narrow timeframe and a very particularized scale so that this maximized
3766600	3769320	the psychological impact of the graph.
3769320	3772080	And so, but that does bring us to this problem of timescale.
3772080	3774600	It's like, well, and variability.
3774600	3778000	How much has things changed over 10,000 years?
3778000	3779560	Like what's the right timescale here?
3779560	3781200	And that's a very difficult problem.
3781200	3793080	Well, the issues of the hockey stick were not so much that the trigger, the hockey stick
3793080	3797400	trigger, the important one is around 2000.
3797400	3804240	Right after that, this was viewed by a mining engineer, Steve McIntyre said, hockey stick,
3804240	3806080	hockey stick, I've seen these things.
3806080	3809800	This is usually a con game trying to get somebody to buy mining stocks.
3809800	3813680	He says, you know, then he got intrigued, he wanted to look at the data.
3813680	3816440	So he asked for the data, they gave him some of it.
3816440	3824960	And he and Ross McKittrick, Canadian economics professor, took a look at this and they found
3824960	3830840	all sorts of errors, you know, mishandling of data, inappropriate statistical methods
3830840	3832600	on and on it goes.
3832600	3840440	And man went after these guys big time rather than, you know, constructively trying to deal
3840440	3842960	with these criticisms.
3842960	3848360	He went after these guys and this turned into a pretty big flame war.
3848360	3853840	And then McIntyre and McKittrick published two additional papers in 2005.
3853840	3857560	And the controversy, you know, was just explosive.
3857560	3861880	There were congressional hearings on this and on and on it went.
3861880	3865280	So it was this huge controversy.
3865280	3874080	And these Climategate emails that were released in 2009 revealed all sorts of skull-dudgery,
3874080	3882040	you know, trying to keep data away from McIntyre and McKittrick, trying to put pressure on
3882040	3886960	journal editors not to publish their papers and on and on it goes.
3886960	3892760	And, you know, and so this was revealed in Climategate.
3892760	3897360	So those were more egregious sins than just picking a convenient timeframe and a convenient
3897360	3898360	scale.
3898360	3899360	Oh, yeah, yeah.
3899360	3906560	But there is a graphical issue and this was the theme of my blog post, Hiding the Decline.
3906560	3911440	So the Paleo climate record just, you know, showed these little oscillations and to get
3911440	3920120	that sort of hockey stick piece, they spliced on the observational record on top of that.
3920120	3925680	And it wasn't clear in the IPCC report that was that was done.
3925680	3931200	It was sort of in some sort of a footnote or an obscure reference, but it never occurred
3931200	3935680	to me as someone in the field that this is what had been done.
3935680	3937480	So no, I don't understand that.
3937480	3938480	Go into that more detail.
3938480	3941160	I don't understand exactly what was done there.
3941160	3942160	Okay.
3942160	3943160	You see the handle?
3943160	3944160	Okay.
3944160	3949920	If you look at the actual tree ring rate data that went into their analysis, it was just
3949920	3953000	like the flat handle.
3953000	3960720	In order to get the blade, the uptick of the blade, they spliced on the historical temperature
3960720	3963480	record, completely different data set.
3963480	3965320	Oh, oh, I see.
3965320	3970040	Because the tree rings weren't showing this uptick.
3970040	3974280	This is a so-called hide the decline.
3974280	3981800	And so, you know, to me, this is something without doing that is a bad idea, but doing
3981800	3990920	that without explaining it is marginal and this is known in some circles subsequently
3990920	3994240	would be given a label as image fraud.
3994240	4000560	And so this is what I wrote my blog post about and I wasn't particularly attacking man because
4000560	4009720	he wasn't the only person involved in this little deception, but, you know, this got
4009720	4016080	a lot of attention and apparently Michael Mann was unhappy and pretty soon after that,
4016080	4020280	you know, he was calling me a denier on Twitter and then I started appearing on all these
4020280	4030040	misinformer lists and by 2012, you know, I was firmly established as a denier and the
4030040	4037560	society of environmental journalists put together a list, a description of all the climate blogs.
4037560	4044480	And my blog was under the list of denier blogs and the description says, unlike most other
4044560	4047400	denier blogs, Currie is a real scientist.
4047400	4054360	She looks at both sides of the issues, digs deep into the issues, discusses the uncertainties
4054360	4058960	and all this other stuff and I said, well, that's a beautiful description of my blog,
4058960	4064040	but why did they accept prima facie that my blog is a denier blog?
4064040	4069280	I mean, it just shows how pervasive and how stupid this whole thing was.
4069280	4072840	So I, you know, I got tossed into the denier camp.
4072840	4083040	I don't align myself with either side, you know, I, I, I preciously fought for my independence,
4083040	4086400	which included resigning my academic position.
4086400	4093520	So you know, I think for myself, I think deep, I look at the evidence, make judgments.
4093520	4099080	And it's mostly about trying to better characterize uncertainties and what we don't know.
4099080	4105400	This is a key part of rational policymaking is to understand the uncertainties and what
4105400	4108600	we don't know.
4108600	4110440	We'll be back in one moment.
4110440	4114880	First we wanted to give you a sneak peek at Jordan's new series, Exodus.
4114880	4124760	So the Hebrews created history as we know it.
4124760	4126320	You don't get away with anything.
4126320	4129920	And so you might think you can bend the fabric of reality and that you can treat people
4129920	4133760	instrumentally and that you can bow to the tyrant and violate your conscience without
4133760	4134760	cost.
4134760	4135760	You will pay the piper.
4135760	4140120	It's going to call you out of that slavery into freedom, even if that pulls you into
4140120	4141120	the desert.
4141120	4149000	And we're going to see that there's something else going on here that is far more cosmic
4149000	4151480	and deeper than what you can imagine.
4151480	4159760	The highest ethical spirit to which we're beholden is presented precisely as that spirit
4159760	4164000	that allies itself with the cause of freedom against tyranny.
4164000	4165000	Yes, it's that hope.
4165000	4166000	And there is that hope.
4166000	4167000	I want villains to get punished.
4167000	4170280	But do you want the villains to learn before they have to pay the ultimate price?
4170280	4171680	That's such a Christian question.
4181480	4188240	Well, we've got a threefold problem here by the sounds of things in some real sense.
4188240	4193560	I mean, the first problem is kind of a positive feedback loop that you alluded to, is that
4193560	4196880	a lot of attention was paid to this potential issue.
4196880	4200880	A lot of money was put into funding investigation into it.
4200880	4205800	That incentivized the growth of a huge scientific enterprise.
4205800	4210520	That incentivized people who were primarily motivated by the money, including the grants.
4210720	4215080	And I mean, it's hard not to be motivated by that if you want to be a practicing scientist.
4215080	4222240	And so there was a lot of financial and practical pressure to produce an environmentally apocalyptic
4222240	4223560	story.
4223560	4228560	And then you could imagine that it's amplified by the fact that reporting that there's no
4228560	4233160	problem on the climate front is not something that's going to produce an attention grabbing
4233160	4241600	headline, especially in the era of declining attention being paid to legacy media outlets.
4241600	4246720	And so we know perfectly well that human beings are much more sensitive to negative information
4246720	4252720	comparatively speaking than to positive information and that you can attract attention with a story
4252720	4257520	of gloom and threat much more effectively than one that states there's no story here
4257520	4259960	at all or something positive.
4259960	4260960	So that's a big problem.
4261080	4267360	And then the third problem I would say is that it's easy for venal and narcissistic politicians,
4267360	4274760	and that's not all of them, to latch on to a convenient money generating apocalyptic nightmare
4274760	4280200	to put themselves forward as white knights on the moral front and to pull the wool over
4280200	4284240	the eyes and maybe even their own eyes in relationship to whether or not they're making
4284240	4286680	any practical progress in the actual world.
4286720	4293480	And so there is a situation where we have a set of positive feedback loops operating
4293480	4298160	in sociological space that are producing a kind of chicken little outcome.
4298160	4303760	And so we're running around claiming that the sky is falling and dumping, tilting our
4303760	4308560	economic systems in a dangerous direction and spending untold hundreds of billions of
4308560	4314960	dollars addressing a problem that is ill defined and likely nowhere nearer of the magnitude
4314960	4316920	that we think it is.
4316920	4322920	And so, and then I want to follow that with a, I tried to make a strong case for why you
4322920	4328560	might be regarded with a certain degree of apprehension from the perspective of the climate
4328560	4331560	apocalypse, but I'm also curious about this.
4331560	4338120	The piece of data that has really emerged as most striking to me on the environmental
4338120	4344880	front over the last 20 years is the recent observations, they've been going on for about
4344920	4353200	five years or 10 years perhaps, that one of the consequences of extra carbon dioxide output
4353200	4361000	is that the planet has greened 15% since the dawn of the millennia and that most of that
4361000	4366600	greening has taken place in what would have otherwise been semi-arid and rather denuded
4366600	4368400	areas.
4368400	4376720	And so I don't see a statistic on the anti-carbon front that's as powerful negatively as the
4376720	4382160	statistic that the planet is 15% greener and that our crops are also in a consequence
4382160	4386080	quite a lot more productive on the pro-carbon dioxide front.
4386080	4390880	So you made the claim earlier that maybe we're in for a period of cooling, that's within
4390880	4395240	the error predictions of the models, but I would like to say, well, why shouldn't I
4395360	4401040	look at the fact that the planet has got 15% greener in 15 years, that's an area bigger
4401040	4406680	than the United States and say, well, why are we so sure that carbon dioxide output is
4406680	4408760	a bad thing at all?
4408760	4413880	I mean, some of the people who initially hypothesized about the greenhouse effect were quite effusive
4413880	4418800	in their predictions that this would produce a greener, more lush and more productive world,
4418800	4420520	a more habitable world.
4420520	4426880	So is it unreasonable to put that forward as a proposition?
4426880	4436440	Again, the apocalypse types are pushing extreme weather events as being caused by warming.
4436440	4442720	The hurricanes, the Pakistan flooding, the heat waves, unusual this, that, and the other.
4442720	4447240	This is what they're pushing as being caused by warming.
4447320	4456720	It's conceivable that there is some element of contribution from fossil-fueled warming
4456720	4464120	to this, but it's because of the large amount of natural weather and climate variability,
4464120	4466200	it's impossible to discern.
4466200	4472760	I mean, if we were to immediately stop emitting fossil fuels, we probably wouldn't notice
4472760	4479120	any change in the weather throughout the rest of the 21st century.
4479120	4485480	So this is the key error in logic that people have been made.
4485480	4488960	Well, I mean, it's not an error in logic.
4488960	4494840	It's a very effective selling point for the alarmist, but people have bought it and people
4494840	4496120	have weather amnesia.
4496120	4502720	I mean, if you just look back to the 1950s to the 1930s or whatever, the weather was
4502840	4507360	much worse, certainly in North America.
4507360	4511320	So it's just something that doesn't make sense.
4511320	4515880	Does that mean we should just keep amping up the fossil-fuel emissions?
4515880	4522080	No, we just really don't quite understand the consequences of this, but neither does
4522080	4533800	it imply that we should urgently reduce emissions and disrupt the global energy systems that
4533800	4541240	will make people less off and less well off and more vulnerable to whatever extreme weather
4541240	4544680	and climate events might happen to occur.
4544680	4549440	So we're hurting ourselves, but we're not doing much in the way of reducing emissions
4549520	4557920	anyways, and we're just making ourselves less prosperous and more vulnerable to extreme
4557920	4559080	weather events.
4559080	4565320	Well, OK, so there's two consequences of that, I would say, is the first is if we do make
4565320	4569880	people less well off by making energy much more expensive, by restricting fossil-fuel
4569880	4575680	use like unreasonably, let's say, or by not pursuing nuclear power, for example, as an
4575680	4577000	alternative.
4577000	4581280	The major consequence of that will be that a lot of poor people who are right on the
4581280	4587880	edge and there's lots of them are poorer than they need to be and will be off the edge.
4587880	4592160	And the consequence of that is, as you already pointed out, that if anything untoward does
4592160	4595760	happen on the weather front, they're going to be much more vulnerable to that.
4595760	4602360	I mean, distinguishing between infrastructure inadequacy and weather catastrophe is very,
4602360	4603360	very difficult.
4603360	4609760	Even when Katrina hit New Orleans, you could say that it was a natural disaster.
4609760	4614520	But you could also say it was an abject failure of planning, because the Army Corps of Engineer
4614520	4621520	Dykes were only designed to withstand a one-in-a-hundred-year storm, whereas when the Dutch built Dykes, they designed
4621520	4624760	them to withstand a one-in-ten-thousand-year storm.
4624760	4628880	So whether that was a natural disaster or a consequence of human foolishness is not
4628880	4630640	precisely obvious.
4630640	4633360	And the same thing applies on the energy front.
4633360	4639560	If we impoverish the already poor by making energy expensive, not only do we expose them
4639560	4645000	to much more risk to life and limb, let's say, and property, but we also decrease the
4645000	4649040	probability that those self-same people are going to be able to take an environmentally
4649040	4655160	oriented view, because the data indicates that if you can get people up to producing
4655240	4662240	or benefiting from economic growth to the tune of about $5,000 a year in average GDP,
4662240	4667240	then they start to take a medium to long-term view of the future and start to attend much
4667240	4671320	more carefully to what you might describe as environmental concerns.
4671320	4676600	So panicking about climate in the way that we're doing, if the consequence is to raise
4676600	4681400	energy prices and impoverish people, looks like it's going to kill more people first
4681400	4683120	because they'll be more vulnerable.
4683120	4687960	And second, that it's going to make, it's going to deliver as far fewer people who are
4687960	4693560	capable of taking the kind of medium to long-term view of sustainability that would be actually
4693560	4697520	beneficial to producing a more livable planet.
4697520	4700440	And I still want to ask your opinion about the greening.
4700440	4702920	Yeah, the greening's happening.
4702920	4708840	I think it's attributed mostly to carbon dioxide, but also more rainfall and warmer temperatures
4709160	4711360	in help.
4711360	4721320	So the greening is definitely a benefit that the greening is happening over a big portion
4721320	4724080	of the globe, actually.
4724080	4728200	So it's clearly a benefit.
4728200	4733720	Well, it's also so perverse, because one of the, it's perverse is the fact that the Americans
4733720	4737440	decreased their carbon output by returning to fracking.
4737440	4738680	Nobody predicted that.
4738680	4744840	But here we have a situation where not only is the planet not getting browner and drier,
4744840	4751120	which was the apocalyptic vision, but many of the areas that were really brown and dry,
4751120	4757120	like the southern edge of the Sahara Desert, are actually seeing the ingress of vegetation
4757120	4761880	in a manner that's, well, unprecedented even up to 15 years ago.
4761880	4768640	And so not only is that not what was predicted, it's the very opposite of what's predicted.
4769200	4775800	And it's the opposite in a very, very massive manner.
4775800	4780680	I mean, 15% increase in greening is just, it's almost beyond comprehension.
4780680	4785200	As I said, that's an area bigger than the continental United States.
4785200	4789200	And then to say as well that that's also produced quite an increment in the productivity of
4789200	4793120	human crops and enabled us to grow more food in less area.
4793120	4797520	So like, those are facts that need to be taken with dead seriousness.
4797520	4799240	They're very positive, perhaps.
4799240	4804360	I mean, you could argue that maybe that rate of vegetation change brings with it threats
4804360	4807720	that we haven't yet envisioned, and that could be the case.
4807720	4813120	But nonetheless, this, it certainly isn't the spreading of the deserts that we were
4813120	4815440	led to be apprehensive of.
4815440	4817240	Well, that's correct.
4817240	4825920	Again, the framing of this going back to 1992 was around dangerous anthropogenic interference
4825920	4827440	in the climate system.
4827440	4829880	So the focus was on dangers.
4829880	4831240	They were looking for dangers.
4831240	4840360	The benefits, you know, weren't even acknowledged until maybe the fifth assessment report in
4840360	4841360	the IPCC.
4841360	4847160	I mean, everything, they were just looking for dangers, that there was no counterweight
4847160	4848240	of the benefits.
4848240	4849240	So.
4849240	4850240	Right.
4850240	4851240	Right.
4851240	4852240	And no cost benefit analysis.
4852240	4854400	I mean, I've talked to Bjorn Lomburg a lot.
4854400	4855400	Yeah.
4855400	4859320	The reason I went after that was that I looked through all the data that you're describing
4859320	4861160	for a long period of time.
4861160	4865760	One of the things that struck me, and struck me as well about the multiplicity of goals
4865760	4871240	that the UN was hypothetically pursuing, was that no one was assessing these risks
4871240	4875280	and benefits in any systematic manner, ranking them.
4875280	4879800	And then I came across Lomburg's work, and he tried to do a cost benefit analysis, looking
4879800	4885640	at our capacity to adapt and ranking the problems that face us in terms of their severity
4885640	4889520	and also what we could do about those problems in some effective manner.
4889520	4896040	And like Lomburg, like you, accepts the IPCC prognostications of a mild warming trend
4896040	4901520	over the next hundred years, but he's done calculations showing that the net consequence
4901520	4907200	of that, even if it is somewhat detrimental economically, if we factor all those costs
4907200	4913040	into account, is that we'll be less, more rich than we would otherwise be, right?
4913040	4918400	Because our GDP is going to increase something like 400% on average in the next hundred
4918400	4923560	years, and one of the negative consequences of global warming will be that it'll be slightly
4923560	4926000	less than 400%.
4926000	4929720	And that it's clear that we can manage that in any real sense, and that we're very good
4929720	4936520	at adapting to a huge range of weather situations and climate scenarios.
4936520	4940880	Some of us live in damn near Arctic conditions, and other people live in the desert.
4940880	4946000	And so it's not outside the realm of human adaptation to adapt to a one or two degree
4946000	4947840	climate transformation.
4947840	4952560	And animals should be able to do the same, assuming that we're reasonably intelligent
4952560	4955560	on the environmental conservation front.
4955560	4960240	And so, I don't know, are you aware of Lomburg's work?
4960240	4961240	What do you think of-
4961240	4969080	Oh, yeah, no, Bjorn and I are in close contact, and I'm very well aware of what he's doing,
4969080	4973080	and he's doing a very good job of making those points.
4973080	4978520	The thing that, you know, the UN has the 17 sustainability goals.
4978520	4983760	I think the first one is to eliminate poverty.
4983760	4986600	The second one is to eliminate hunger.
4986600	4996520	The number seven is energy, affordable energy for all, and the number 13 is climate action.
4996520	5001800	And you've got to wonder, how did climate action, even one piece of that, which is elimination
5001800	5011640	of fossil fuels, come to Trump, elimination of poverty and elimination of hunger?
5011640	5018520	Climate aid from the UN, from the World Bank and whatever is now focused on mitigation,
5018520	5023880	the traditional objectives of economic development and help with adaptation.
5023880	5029480	Those are put on the back burner in favor of mitigation.
5029480	5036240	And this is making people less well off, and we're squandering opportunities for human
5036240	5037240	development.
5037240	5046000	You know, for senseless objectives that aren't expected to improve anyone's life over the
5046000	5050360	course of the 21st century and could very well make us all worse off.
5050360	5057080	Okay, so this is part of the incomprehensibility of this to me, because it looks to me like
5057080	5064040	a lot of the arguments, for example, that would force us to take the apocalyptic prognostications
5064040	5065680	of the doomsayer seriously.
5065680	5072600	The moral arguments go something like this, well, you know, a hundred years if there's
5072600	5077400	a lot of climate change, it's primarily going to be the world's poor who pay the largest
5077400	5080200	price for that, the world's poor and oppressed.
5080200	5086000	And to mitigate against that, we have to adopt policies that however painful they are in
5086000	5091520	the short term, will mitigate against that because of our concern for the long term viability
5091520	5094760	of, let's say, these poverty-stricken people.
5094760	5099000	But the problem with that is that the models aren't very reliable, and it's absolutely
5099000	5104280	100% certain that if we raise energy prices, which we have been doing quite effectively,
5104280	5110080	and food prices, we're going to make life much more difficult for impoverished people throughout
5110080	5112120	the developing world right now.
5112120	5116000	And in a way that's going to kill plenty of people, and it's certainly going to deprive
5116000	5121500	many others of educational opportunity and nutritional, optimal nutritional input and
5121500	5125340	all of that, 100% certain that's going to occur.
5125340	5131860	But the moral aspect is, well, we shouldn't be doing things that would endanger those
5131860	5134180	people who are oppressed and poor.
5134180	5137900	But the policies we're pursuing do precisely that.
5137900	5143940	So again, I'm still left with this complete incapacity to understand how this can possibly
5143940	5145100	be the case.
5145100	5149580	I don't get it because there's lots of other things we could be doing.
5150300	5154180	Well, leaders in Africa are quite outspoken.
5154180	5157700	They're on the front lines of being the victims of all this.
5157700	5166820	They refer to green colonialism, energy apartheid that they're facing over this global warming
5166820	5167820	policies.
5167820	5168940	Right, right, right.
5168940	5174220	And they can't get loans from development banks to build.
5174220	5180820	They have plenty of fossil natural gas, coal, a lot of fossil fuel resources in Africa.
5180820	5186380	They can't get loans to build their own power plants.
5186380	5192340	The only thing that they're able to do is sell their fuel to Europe.
5192340	5200500	So Europe is exploiting them doubly by taking their fuel, but not allowing it.
5200500	5206300	It's politically incorrect for these banks to fund the development of power plants.
5206300	5210220	So the Africans can develop their own economy.
5210220	5211220	It's just evil.
5211220	5215700	And I think green colonialism and energy apartheid are perfect descriptors for what's
5215700	5216700	going on.
5216700	5223820	Well, it's just, again, it leaves me open mouthed in amazement that we in the developed
5223820	5229740	world with our functional economies and our high level of luxury and security can say
5229940	5234660	to developing worlds, the developing world, well, you know, we've got it pretty good here
5234660	5236940	and we're probably willing to cut back a little bit.
5236940	5241820	But you guys down there in the developing countries, you know, you should be pretty damn careful
5241820	5245780	about your carbon output because, you know, we've only got one planet.
5245780	5249460	And so it isn't really obvious that any of you should have the same kind of benefits
5249460	5250460	that we have.
5250460	5253700	The planet can't sustain that level of luxury and security.
5253700	5257180	And so we're just not going to let you have any money.
5257180	5261420	We're not going to help you develop your economy so that you can benefit from the same industrial
5261420	5268020	revolution that has enabled us to educate our children and to have plenty to eat and
5268020	5270620	to be warm in the winter and cool in the summer.
5270620	5275660	And then what's even more preposterous is it's the very people who are constantly clamoring
5275660	5282460	about the oppressive nature of Western culture who are foisting this very story on these
5282460	5283820	developed countries.
5284020	5291780	Yeah, the irony is that even if the African nations were given, you know, the carbon credits
5291780	5297780	or whatever and allowed to develop to where they want to be and where anyone expects them
5297780	5304260	to be, at most they would be emitting like five or six percent of global emissions.
5304260	5308940	And this is for like a billion people in the population.
5308940	5315220	So we're not talking about a lot of extra emissions to allow them to develop.
5315220	5317900	I mean, it just makes absolutely no sense.
5317900	5319220	And it's evil.
5319220	5320220	It's absolutely evil.
5320220	5322580	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5322580	5323580	That's how it looks to me too.
5323580	5329500	Well, I'm glad to hear that you regard Lomborg as a credible commentator on such things.
5329500	5335540	Well, you know, I've looked across a wide variety of political and scientific thinkers over
5335620	5341980	a 20-year period trying to identify people that I believe to be credible on the interface
5341980	5346940	between economic development and energy and environmental management.
5346940	5350220	And I like Schellenberger.
5350220	5353500	I think Eppstein has some interesting things to say.
5353500	5357620	I like Marion Tupi.
5357620	5359740	What's the English?
5359740	5361740	What's his name?
5361740	5362740	Richard Tull.
5362740	5363740	Matt Ridley.
5363740	5364740	I think Ridley is good.
5364740	5365740	Yeah, yeah.
5365740	5369900	And so, but of all those people, I think Lomborg has done the most credible job.
5369900	5372540	And he's also been given a damn rough ride in the media.
5372540	5378140	I mean, he's doing pretty well now, I think, promoting his message, which is such a lovely,
5378140	5382580	what he lays out is such a lovely scenario, because he shows how much good we could do
5382580	5387500	in the world, especially with regard to the amelioration of absolute poverty and the provision
5387500	5392860	of education, at such a tiny fraction of the amounts of money that are being devoted to
5392860	5398180	this insane prevention of a non-existent climate apocalypse.
5398180	5403220	And I've been doing everything I can for whatever it's worth to draw attention to his work.
5403220	5410260	But the fact that he's been pilloried, like you've been pilloried, makes it, well, there's
5410260	5412340	always a question lurking in the back of my mind.
5412340	5414940	It's sort of like, well, where there's smoke, there's fire.
5414940	5419180	If people are constantly being attacked for their views on moral grounds, maybe there's
5419180	5420300	something to that.
5420660	5425380	I certainly, I haven't been able to find that my analysis of your work, or Franzen's.
5425380	5430380	I certainly have seen none of that whatsoever in relationship to Lomborg.
5430380	5433340	So the mystery still remains for me.
5433340	5440700	Okay, they went after Lomborg early on, you know, 2003, whatever, following his book,
5440700	5443180	The Skeptical Environmentalist.
5444060	5455060	The issue was that he didn't regard the reduction of fossil fuel emissions as the be all and
5455060	5456060	end all.
5456060	5459100	There were more important things to do.
5459100	5461380	And for that, he got labeled.
5461380	5466460	That was a very dangerous perspective, because they were just so set on this one particular
5466460	5476940	policy for reasons, for poorly justified reasons, and for reasons that became harder
5476940	5480100	to justify as time went on.
5480100	5482380	And they're still stuck on this.
5482380	5488340	And it just defies logic, and it's going to cause a lot of damage in the world.
5488340	5492100	It defies logic unless your primary goal is easy moral virtue.
5492100	5496540	So imagine, you know, the problem with Lomborg's work fundamentally, and this is the problem
5496540	5502340	with marketing it too, is that he offers a multivariate and multidimensional analysis
5502340	5504180	of the problems besetting the world.
5504180	5507820	He says, well, we don't just have one problem, climate apocalypse.
5507820	5513700	We have like 100 problems, and then we have the problem of how to rank order these problems.
5513700	5518300	And then we have the problem of generating actual solutions and assessing them.
5518340	5523060	And that's actually requires a lot of cognitive effort, you know, to walk through those.
5523060	5529780	And so, but where if you're a climate apocalypse, you can reduce the entire panoply of human
5529780	5535260	problems to one problem, and then you can put yourself forward as a moral person by
5535260	5539700	just saying, well, I'm definitely concerned about the fate of the planet.
5539700	5542780	And that's all anybody reasonable should be concerned about.
5542780	5549580	And because I'm concerned in that manner, I'm a fully credible and reputationly remarkable
5549580	5550580	person.
5550580	5555700	And that's part of the psychological proclivity that is behind this.
5555700	5556700	Okay.
5556700	5562500	And so everything bad that happens, someone finds a path to blame it on climate change.
5562500	5563500	Okay.
5563500	5564500	Yeah.
5564500	5565900	And the media amplifies it.
5565900	5568500	And this gives politicians an easy out.
5568500	5575620	So rather than dealing with their real problems, you know, poor land use, poor regulations,
5575620	5582900	poor whatever inadequate infrastructure, whatever might be the cause of their actual problems,
5582900	5585260	they simply blame it on global warming.
5585260	5587420	And so that gives them an easy out.
5587420	5588420	Yeah.
5588420	5592420	I read an article yesterday that climate change was increasing the risk that women were being
5592420	5593660	abused in their homes.
5593660	5598460	That was just a classic example, you know, and I mean, you know, you can't just say
5598460	5602740	you can make the case that whatever produces economic instability is going to raise the
5602740	5608180	roots, you know, the rates of abuse, but to link it directly to climate change is a really
5608180	5611340	egregious example of exactly the kind of thing that you're describing.
5611340	5612340	All right.
5612340	5615100	Well, look, we're out of time on this segment.
5615100	5619780	I'm going to talk to Dr. Curry for an additional half an hour on the Daily Wire Plus platform
5619780	5621500	for those of you who are watching and listening.
5621500	5622500	You might be interested in that.
5622500	5627220	I'm going to talk about the development of her interest in her scientific endeavors
5627220	5630980	and in her entrepreneurial endeavors as well.
5630980	5631980	Hello everyone.
5631980	5638540	I would encourage you to continue listening to my conversation with my guest on DailyWirePlus.com.
