{"text": " It's my great joy to introduce Daniel Schmockenberger to you all. Daniel is a wonderful polymath, really extraordinary public speaker who is the head of the Civilization Research Institute and co-founder of the Conciliance Project and is probably, this is kind of the personal story, there's two people in the last five years of my life that have really dramatically shifted my world view, my spirituality, etc., and of people living, of living people I would say that Daniel and Robin Wall Kimmerer, who are brave and sweet grass, have been the two kind of major ships for me and have greatly not only shifted my view of the world and what we need to be doing in it, but also have really grounded me spiritually, have shifted my kind of heart sense of how to relate. And so obviously Daniel and I have met once before, but anytime I get to see Daniel, it's just a joy to bring him in and a joy to introduce him to the Quaker Earth Care Witness community, all others. So QEW is an organization, a Quaker organization that focuses on Earth Care concerns, we're a global network, and we're really excited to bring Daniel in here today to talk about a civilizational rite of passage, and obviously a rite of passage is something you don't know what the end of it is, you don't know if we're going to make it, if we're not going to make it, but what you can do is you can be faithful in the process, you can be true in the process. And I think that this being true is something that Daniel often refers to as deep earnestness. And so we're going to sort of investigate today some of what Daniel calls the metacrisis. It's a term that's kind of thrown in a number of sort of sense-making communities that are working on these large big picture topics, and how seeing that metacrisis coming under the weight of that, how we can respond to it in a powerful and spiritual way. So with that, I just want to, those are my opening comments, and I just want to invite Daniel, do you have anything you want to share before we kind of dive in? My mom went to a friend's school when she was a kid and always spoke very highly of her experience and had a mentor for a while when I was a kid named Dr. Everett Slumis. He was one of the kind of pioneers of natural medicine in the West and got to live on a health retreat that he had when I was young, and he was a Quaker. And so I have not got to experience Quaker community very much myself, but I have very positive associations. And so it was cool when you told me about this. And if my schedule is not overful with the timely things we're working on, I would have joined you for the whole day because I like the tone of what you shared with me that you're exploring here together, the spirituality that is in service of ecology, life, well, deep earnestness and deep humility. So being that you've had a full day and I haven't had all that, I hope that this weaves. And I'm just happy to be here. And I also said yes to coming just because of the way that in our limited interaction, talking once, but also just the way I've seen you post online is clear that you are a very caring, thoughtful, earnest person. And I, yeah, I like to support activities and people like that. Yeah, I think Daniel, some of the people in our community have probably heard me say things like humanity has reached a point where we've become too powerful to remain in rivalry with ourselves. And that, you know, the problem is that we have a profound gap between our capacities as a species and the wisdom that guides them. And I would say that of everyone I attribute that sort of framing to, it's you. And I think that the beauty of the really extraordinary thing is that you bring out that framing, not just as a way to understand our own times and what needs to be done in them, but also as a way of understanding of how we got here. How did a species that clearly does not want to destroy its own climate do that collectively, nonetheless, right? How is it that collective decisions that no one would want end up becoming, you know, almost unavoidable, like the momentum is so extraordinary that nothing can seem to overcome it. And so if we can kind of talk about that and talk about its relation, this is what Daniel calls the metacrisis and talk about how that relates to our understanding of history. I just want to open that, open that to you. What is the metacrisis and where are we in that? Yeah, I just share in starting that in general, I don't like talking about this publicly, because it's mostly not empowering and just kind of despair causing uselessly. I mostly talk about it to institutions and flancer pests and whatever where there is something they can do and try to tailor it to what they they can do. It's not that there isn't any way we can relate to it more effectively. You come to understand the whole picture more. We it's devastating before it's empowering, it can be motivating and ennobling, but it also the analysis shows that most of the things that one could be hopeful about work. And so there is like a there's a lot of faith actually required to want to engage with that in a meaningful way because you have to go through a kind of crucible to come out on the other end in some way empowered. And I think if it I think it's because there's a spiritual practice and a community holding each other here that I feel okay talking about it. You're mentioning climate change and you know this kind of obligate nature. The first paper on scientific paper on climate change was published in 1938. The United Nations Environmental Programme recognizing the need for international coordination on global commons issues was made in 1972 well over 50 years ago. And climate change has become one of the biggest existential risk topics in the world. It has over a trillion dollars a year in climate funding. And every with the exception of global recessions every single year we use more fossil fuels in the year before. And during that whole time all of the solar wind renewable energy all the hydro and the damaging effect of the dams and all of the nuclear and the entire risk of the nuclear energy hasn't even slowed the increase in fossil fuels use one year. And so when you look at and yet the most fascinating thing is there is literally no one who wants climate change as like a strategic objective. There I mean yes you can say that the Russians are capitalizing on the fact that they get a new shipping route through the Arctic. But no one has climate change as an objective and yet nobody can stop it. Because everybody wants energy because energy is one for one course related with GDP and this ability to actuate anything and money has to exponentially grow every year to keep up with the interest which means that the energy demand has to exponentially grow every year. And the solar plant is going to take 10 years worth of the energy that it produces out of fossil fuel energy to make up front. And then we don't decide to make less fossil fuel energy it's we just make all of the stuff in which there is energy return on energy investment. While there are plenty of groups that don't care enough about species extinction nobody really wants species extinction and nobody really wants PFOS in literally every raindrop in the world which it is now. As an ubiquitous carcinogen and stuff or there's 230 million chemicals in the American Chemical Society database almost all of them are toxic cancels, antigens, endocrine disruptors whatever. The curve of the increasing autoimmune diseases, the increasing autism, the increasing Alzheimer's, the increasing psychiatric diseases follows the curve of those chemicals and nobody wants a toxic planet and also nobody can stop it. And the total set of all activities that has been done since Silent Spring was written since the environmental movement started we have put more toxic chemicals each year into the environment than the year before and innovated more new ones. And it's not just that the processes have been ineffective it's that many of them have made things worse right that if we say okay because of climate change and fossil fuel use we really need to push non-fossil fuel energy so we push more nuclear and so now we get increased risk of warfare associated with nuclear and toxic waste and etc and it doesn't slow fossil fuels and then you do more dams and so you destroy more ecosystems and create more geopolitical tensions between the countries that share the river it's typically the case that the way that we go about solving the problems doesn't work and makes them worse and I didn't have that analysis when I was young and started and was kind of like hopeful that we could just put more energy into the things. So why? Like why is this? I would also say when you were talking you mentioned that there are certain kind of like principles that come from conscience that were things people could choose before but they're obligate now because self-termination on this path is the otherwise impending possibility. I wouldn't even say that they were possible before they were impossible because if you held a set of views that did not mount effective military forces and Genghis Khan and his men or Alexander the Great or the Ottomans or whatever were coming you were slaughtered. And there have been a lot of peaceful beautiful cultures throughout history that listened to their conscience and got slaughtered. We just did an analysis of this on you know the history of selection via warfare and you know Genghis Khan and his men alone in his life not the entire Mongols killed 50 million people on horseback without nuclear weapons without industrial weapons killed 50 million people. That was 11% of the entire global population including lots of lovely cultures that because they were lovelier didn't mount huge militaries and fascinatingly it's actually a really just weird irony that the current estimate is that 11% of all Asians today are Genghis Khan's descendants because the amount of rape that he and then the genetics of that family did so kill the people do all the raving. So and then when you look at that for Dutch colonization in the Congo and Attila and blah blah blah you realize that we alive today are the descendants memetically and genetically of the most successful conkers and that the Tibetans could keep a relatively nice set of ideas as long as they were remote enough that nobody cared about their land that much and as soon as it became clear that they controlled the watershed between two billion person populations uh then a violent culture slaughtered them and the same with the Native Americans and the colonizers here the the population of North and South America before colonizers came was 140 million people and colonization wiped out over 90% of them that's it that's a lot of people and that means those those ways of being those those non-alphabetic languages those non-written languages those systems of medicine those poetries those all of that you know wiped out of history so I don't think it was possible like an individual could try to be lovely and the tribe could try to be lovely but you didn't actually make it through history that way and you most certainly didn't shape the world very much that way and so this topic of the you know kind of a multipolar trap somebody does something that provides so much near-term competitive advantage that everyone else is obligated to do that or lose and lose means your ideas don't make it through selection that has been an amazingly powerful part of a very perverse selection process and this is still the case and this is why open AI that was founded to because of the fear of market-driven AI and the need to make a very well-funded research institute to focus on slowing down market AI risk became the company like switched from a non-profit to a for-profit and accelerate AI risk more than any and it's why then seeing that that was happening and saying it was bad a part of open AI broke off created anthropic to really do AI risk work and then realized that in order to do that they needed a lot of money to have big AI systems they took the money became a for-profit and now are also racing and so again what that happened is pretty much everyone got into the multipolar trap of the dude with more power wins there is no way out of this and unless you want to just die with dignity you okay we have to win and we have to do whatever violent etc thing is going to let us win but then we'll be the good guys and this is basically the state of geopolitics between us and china right now and many many places so in that way ethics are constraints on strategic possibilities and those who have less of them have less constraints and those win at strategy and so one cannot afford to have them right which is why there are so many real politic theorists to basically say if you have any ethics you're an asshole because what you're actually saying is that you don't care about anything enough to be effective yeah and if you really want to be effective you have to win and you got to do what it takes so if you care you'll be you know you'll you'll do the Machiavellian thing which is such a weird you know basically it's what happened to Soromon and Lord of the Rings right it's what happens again and again power winning is inevitable and therefore embracing it is actually ethical because it's your only way to influence it and so that's the co-opting of the ethics right but what's the other choice so there's a way in which just choosing to die with dignity well we'll be ethical our hands will be clean while the world burns yeah um and if you look at the history the Jane Goodall's of the world have not had the level of influence on the world system the Kissingers have had not by a billion to one and the minds and heart the the developmental process that makes a Jane Goodall does not give you Kissinger skills the developmental process that gives you Kissinger skills does not give you Jane Goodall values they are almost developmentally mutually exclusive yeah and yet we don't make it if we don't actually get both of those in the same beings now but where those skills are not in service to power and the perpetuation of the system but are in service to all sentience now and into perpetuity but that's that hard in that mind together right in the same beings and yeah so right now we obviously you know you know the crossed six of the nine planetary boundaries radically rapidly crossing the other ones all of the curves are accelerating if we tried to turn it around it's not even clear that we could um nobody really understands and obviously the the post-war order that maintained relative peace between superpowers meaning we only proxy ward through korean vietnam and whatever other places and economic warfare and etc that has completely broken down that kind of post-war order is not uh effective anymore at preventing major power conflict and so we can see that we have multiple three world war three escalation pathways hot right now which is why the atomic scientists moved the nuclear clock closer to midnight than it was during the cuba missile crisis and we see actually an increase in hawkishness everywhere and if you look at just even the rate of say ai and the reason that ai is so important more than any other category of tech it's because i can i can't use a nuclear weapon to make a bio weapon i can't use a nuclear weapons to make a financial system i can't use a bio weapon to make a financial system i can use ai to make better nukes and better bio weapons and better financial systems and better manufacturing and better propaganda so the race there the you know more's law was completely unprecedented in history being doubling the computing power every two years but every 18 months so you get an exponential curve currently just the hardware alone on gpu's is 10 xing the compute efficiency every six months not to mention that you also have an exponential curve on the software on the amount of data on the parameters and so every and this is why there's you know been about 30 trillion just invested in the last couple years trillion to win ai supremacy as the ring to rule them all and nobody who thinks they can win has any interest in multilateral agreements to slow it down so you could say these are times that were prophesied you could say that the end of kali yuga and the beginning of the possible beginning of satyuga you could say the time of purgatory or the end of the mayan calendar or whatever we're all roughly speaking to a similar thing and you could say that once you got the written word so you got history you know like a more kind of formal version of history it wasn't that hard for philosophers of the time to recognize that with populations increasing the wars killed more people because the number of people that gang is conkilled was more than the entire world population at the beginning of the agricultural revolution like just to have a sense right so with the increasing population killed more people with the increasing technology we killed more people from further distance right you get the crossbow you get the cannon you get the fowlings you get the and it's pretty clear to see that humans were not very good stewards of their power right every culture had class subjugation torture or whatever once we got into empire not pre-empire um and so the idea that we have that kind of mixed bag of some really lovely stuff but really wicked stuff but that the wicked stuff is getting larger populations with more tech and the wars are killing more people and we're like early civilizations were destroyed because of environmental overshoot right if you read tainter in the collapse of complex civilizations you can see that cutting down all the trees eroding the topsoil and the civilization fails has been happening for thousands of years so um but obviously with the capacity to destroy environments at larger scale you know the beginning of big belly ships and greater fishing and blah blah blah uh so you could prophesize hey this time is going to come to an end there's going to be a great reckoning the wickedness of our ways is going to have to be reconciled there's going to be a hard fork and either everybody decides we stop this kind of wickedness of our ways we become good stewards of power and as such as good stewards of power we reinstate the garden or something like that or we don't and it goes from purgatory to hell some to an end uh because this thing self terminates i i think those prophecies were pretty straightforward actually like pretty straightforwardly accurate and i do think we are at a time now where until nuclear weapons that couldn't have been you couldn't destroy everything that quickly obviously until industrial scale globalization you couldn't destroy the environment so uh we're really to the first time in the history of the world at this place where the ongoing viability of the world is up to us we couldn't have destroyed it before even when we tried and so it is it is true that it is obligate for us to become good stewards of power because if we continue to steward it the way we have we'll destroy ourselves it is also true that some people doing that not in the presence of other people doing it lose the game of influence if not the game of survival in the very short term to be able to make it through there's a book of romans the path to heaven is narrow and steep the path to hell is wide and many there is something like that there there is basically a needle that has to be thread and that is the uh hope for this time is the ability to properly thread the needle of that which will make us good stewards of power that can also navigate the space of power currently to influence it enough that it on its current trajectory doesn't mess everything up well i think that you know i want to talk a bit more about threading that needle and in particular it's become pretty clear to me in my study of you know when in academia we would call collective action problems or social traps which is what daniel just called the multi-polar trap that situation where you know vying geopolitical entities seek power and that the only way to get around this like i actually came to that realization at some level when i took western political philosophy too and i was reading thomas hobs and hobs you know has that war at all against all and i think that there's a lot of people in this room probably thinking well aren't there cooperative forces not just competitive forces and human history as well as an evolution i think that's a really valid argument maybe we'll come back to that but i want to talk about you know there's two kind of ways to get around a collective action problem and one of them is what hobs refer to as the little viathon which is you get enough power and you impose power and you make it so anyone who would do something that's not good you know that's competitive and trying to do the power gain you shut them down that's way one and the other way is through cooperation and that one's really hard i mean if anyone is you know folks who might have started the eco village or something like that in this talk and even getting just a few people to get along is hard right so we might come back to that but i think that what is really insightful here is that um we have to at some level through conscience through without ever getting you know you know as soon as you start down that road once you start down the dark path right through conscience we gain influence through conscience we have to at some level push in the same way that donby or others would have done you had extraordinary influence but you know he gained that influence not by being a really terrible player on the world stage but by acting in a conscientious way because we're a social species and we respond you know we we have a an immediate response to you know a mirror neuron type response if you're if you are acting a certain way i i feel that in my own self and and so there's a way in which um i just i guess i guess i wanted to talk to that a bit daniel do you see um that sort of path of like uniting conscience with um with uh i hate to call it spirit with strategy but i really you know maybe emphasis on the conscience part and then the strategy part has to be born of that right has to be born from the conscience piece um and then moving from there do you think that there's a pathway to thread that needle through the force of conscience through um prophetic voice now as a kid i was my mom was taking me to a bunch of protests and um you know various nonprofits pita and greenpeace and like that engage in an activism work i remember there was a few NGOs that came together to protest a nuclear waste dump being created and i got to see how the activists were organizing and i got to see how the nuclear and financial and legal entities on the other side were organizing a little bit just watching as a kid and there was this insight that came the the first level of the insight was the the activists are obviously motivated by something that is much less self-interest they're chaining themselves to things where they get hurt um they're willing to go to jail they're but their tools of strategy are chaining themselves to things and picket signs and like that and the tools of strategy on the other side are employing heaps of mathematicians and physicists and chemists and lobbyists and financiers and etc and it's just it's so obvious who's winning and you know like who's going to win and why but also who should right that distinction and i saw it as like a head heart divide at the level of humanity that had to be unified and then i looked a little bit later and thought of it as like a a head heart will um because i could see people where there if any two of the three didn't work right if someone had a lot of will and a lot of heart meaning like there was a lot of care about other beings and the willingness to take a lot of action but they didn't understand strategy well they were most activists if they could think about the complexity of the world well and the perverse incentives of financial motivations the lobbying on the other side etc and they cared a lot but they didn't have a lot of empowerment they were like kind of broken devastated liberal academics um if the heart was kind of shut down and they were mostly pursuing self-interest but they understood strategy and they were pretty empowered with will they were the people who ran the world and ran big oil companies and finance companies and military industrial companies and things like that and um so it was very clear that those coming together was necessary kind of requisite right and it is obvious that the strategy does not actually pick what is valuable it figures out how to do effective work towards what is valuable that comes from deeper places and so uh intellect and strategy in service of conscience is necessary right like there's no uh conscience that doesn't know how to be very effective is kind of a death with dignity strategy um and you know for me seeing that and being like if I work my ass off and all the animals are still in the factory farm I don't feel okay about that I don't feel some self-relief I don't feel proud like I I want to be effective at it and so a lot of people talk about not caring about the result as much but the process because in the when one over focuses on results they can go out of integrity I care about the relationship between the results and the process both right um now if you one other thing though is like let's say you take a look at Gandhi which is you know as good an exemplars you could get of this if you do a realism analysis right the kind of political school of realism coming out of real politic analysis of non-violence movements you get a very different perspective than the story the non-violence movements tell and I think it is a more historically and politically accurate one and it's important to understand if you want to be effective the realist analysis is Gandhi said that what happened with the British and India could have worked against Hitler total gibberish like complete obvious total gibberish um and in the only reason there were a few but the reason why at that particular time in India that was able to work is because as he said early in the career in his career there 20,000 British soldiers cannot rule 400 million Indians if the 400 million Indians don't consent they were already getting to the place of the willingness to have enough of their people die to violently kill all of the 20,000 soldiers there was a violence movement that he was holding at bay with the non-violence which is why they didn't kill him and every non-violence movement that has been effective against very against powers that are willing to enact violence has only been effective when it was the better alternative against violence as the alternative and a very similar thing was that in the assessment that so like if they'd killed Gandhi then the Indians would have started killing British soldiers at scale right the only reason he didn't get killed and so it's just important to understand that the reason that the US went ahead and made some provisions with Martin Luther King was because the power Malcolm X and the Black Panthers were getting a scaring the shit out of them and the idea of move the attention over here to the non-violence thing was like positive so the reason I bring this up is because if you want to look at previous precedents of things that were successful to be able to try to do successful work do your research well enough to say was it actually successful and how did it work so that's really powerful Daniel and I still you know sitting here I have a pretty deep conviction about using moving from a place of conscience to to shift the world in a better way and I think that conscience calls us to strategy I think that if we're really deeply in touch with conscience we do the strategy because we actually don't want to live in a world where what's happening in factory farms is happening in factory farms and we want to live in a world which is beautiful and hopeful I think a one step beyond the three part will art mine the chakras are a lovely system right if you I don't know if people here are familiar with it but the you know the yogic system and the egyptian system the chinese system are pretty similar so whenever there's a bunch of independent origination it's kind of interesting but each of them are different are thought of as different types of intelligence and that a full human approach is all of them and so if you I don't need to go through them here and take the time for it but if you are to think about to it we want to engage not with a part of the world but all of the world but we want to engage with all of the world with all of our self right and all of our self means all of our agency and all of our intellect all of our intuition all of our instinct all of those things in service of all the world so I think there was a talk that I really liked that Eckhart and the Dalai Lama did together one time where Eckhart was saying something about like in his language when you access the power of now you have increased coherence for capabilities at whatever it is that you're going to do and then somebody in the audience asked something about when you access that is it like accessing the Akashic records where you can just get anything and do anything and Eckhart was like I don't have that experience because like a great soccer player who gets quiet and goes into a place of stillness comes out and does the the free kick better than he would have otherwise but he's like if I went to do that I still wouldn't make the goal as Eckhart right he's like I don't I don't do that thing well when Einstein would go into silence he'd come out with math but Eckhart was like I never get math like I never get general relativity coming out of there and he asked the Dalai Lama he's like no I don't ever get general relativity because I didn't take that in and the same reason that when someone goes deeply into prayer they usually get answers in languages they speak they usually don't get them in Sanskrit or Mandarin or some language they don't speak so there's a place where listening to conscience it can only tell you things that you have also cultivated your being to understand so this is where the the models of what does it take to be effective such that you develop those in yourself such that as you're going into prayer and going into listening those languages exist within you to be spoken to is also important yeah well I feel like we've gone really deep and I think that I can imagine folks in the audience right now being like that is a harsh view of human history or of what we're what we're up against I suppose and the strategies that might work or approaches that might work and I mean I feel like I want to sort of finish out by sort of entering some of that stillness together and wondering if there's in particular a message to the QEW community to Quakers that you feel you know you were just mentioning you know like Einstein comes out with this what is the unique role of faith communities in this time and and what would what is the earnestness I don't know how many people here saw when this pope got put in place and he wrote the Lodato si encyclical if you saw it awesome if not it's really worth reading it's actually very beautiful and basically what he said was and I'm grossly paraphrasing there's been this kind of forever conversation or debate about is God transcendent beyond the creation or eminent indwelling within the creation I would say that the error in the direction of an overemphasis on transcendent over eminent has caused a lot of problems because we can destroy things here in a holy war for going to heaven or for good reincarnation or for getting off the wheel or whatever it is that makes that denies some of the sacredness of here and if you hold the creator indwells within its creation and any harm against creation is sin against the creator uh there's a much safer ethics that emerges so if you take the direction of eminence and basically what he said in the Lodato si is the eminence matters and that if you aren't an environmentalist protecting God's creation you aren't a Catholic now of course that was a fucking big deal to say like a God created all of this thing this is all sacred if you are harming God's creation you're in sin that doesn't mean that really changed anything because like so often would happen in something like Catholicism it's kind of like easy to moralize people while not actually changing the things that dispose their beliefs and behaviors and so what I would love to see follow is a okay what would it take then the Vatican to leverage its resources to say how do we help people deepen their understanding of nature their connection to it and change the perverse incentives that force you know environmental harm and things like that that'd be amazing I think all the faith communities have beliefs that could be emphasized you know like there are some Christians who focus on the wrath of the Leviticus God and the reasons to kill someone for violating the Sabbath or who focus on the forgiveness of Jesus and let he who has no sins cast the first stone you can kind of emphasize different aspects of it I think most of the faiths have things that if they were emphasized would be profoundly relevant to the situation today and when it comes to Quakers I don't I don't know I would need to ask a lot of questions and spend some time and to be very interested in but the you know there's like the starting place is if total global Quakers is a few hundred thousand right yeah probably yeah and so if we were to say that well that's a small population in one way it's a lot of people like a lot of people that have a some shared sense of what is meaningful sacred etc that they're willing to obviously live their lives differently based on make some sacrifices based on if they could come to understand the state of the world more rather than just kind of local issues understand you know the metacrisis the drivers and what addressing that would take and have their life as a group not just individually be coordinated in service of helping the world move through this point in history not to the direction of self-destruction or totalizing dystopias but in the direction of you know something like reinstatement of a garden what would it mean for that to actually become the timely imperative of Quakers as a whole that they could coordinate towards that'd be very interesting yeah well I think it's actually we're almost perfectly on track I want to kind of transition at the 45-minute mark since our opening worship to bring in some questions from the audience and do you want to ask your question yeah um yeah so in humanity's phase shift which is what Keith the video that a lot of us watched before coming to hear you today Daniel um you said that reconditioning our felt sense of interconnectedness with everything um won't won't be easy and will require a fundamental shift of our consciousness um and I thought that the ways you the three things that you offered as ways to reconnect were we're humorous and I wanted to ask how that has changed but the three things you offered were to be in nature, do psychedelics and have more intimate relationships with more people and so how have your modes of reconnection changed in the last five years since that conversation in that video? first I'll say um there's a woman named Vanessa Andreade she wrote a beautiful book called Hospicing Modernity and I got to speak with recently um indigenous woman who's actually a leading some amazing educational projects in Canada and we just talked and she told me that the way that her chief defines colonialism and I thought this was very beautiful uh had nothing to do with taking other people's land or violence or property ownership or whatever that those were all epiphenomenon that the heart of colonialism is believing there are separable things and deeper than believing that is perceiving the world as separable things the pattern of perception cultivated and that that conditioning of mind I don't think can avoid creating more separation more externalities more rivalry in the process of everything it does intrinsic to the nature of how it perceives and as a result in how it sense makes and what it does so and that's not intrinsic to the nature of mind it's intrinsic to the way that most modern civilizations have cultivated mind and so uh cultivating and you know David Bohm and Krishna Murthy and so many said something almost identical about what the root of all the problems is so at the basis having a perception where you don't see things as separate things that you label in words with a packet of information that is fairly static about what that thing is you um you have unmediated contact with reality not mediated through words and concepts that increases the depth of your sensing because your sense making can't be better than your sensing is and most of the time we were perceiving so shallowly so little of the total bandwidth of the thing and then our sense making is almost all based on abstractions and the abstraction that the the world of our ideas of what a tree is and what everything is is not the world it's a simulation and so we live in that simulation on the world so the ability to have much deeper sensing that is not mediated through word and concept where the interconnectedness of everything is intrinsic and the uniqueness of everything is intrinsic both uh I would say it's only from there all you know what you're calling conscience internally in a reality that is where there's no separation there's no separability I can say i'm a separate thing but take plants away and I don't exist take the gravitational field away I don't exist take the sun away I don't exist so the concept of me as a separable thing is nonsense because it depends I depend on a lot of things that are outside of the definition of me in that inseparable nature of reality listening within and listening without are both kind of the same I mean they're both valuable they're they have different qualities so meditating and listen and being still and listening internally in different ways to the sensations in my body to the emotions to subtle intuition is all very important really deeply witnessing nature and really deeply witnessing people and listening is just as important as another kind of prayer So I I find conscience and spirit distributed everywhere right because there's nothing in which spirit is not indwelling so that mode of perception the interconnectedness the uniqueness of everything and really being with the instantiated details fully is the only mode of mind from which strategies about how to make things better are rightly grounded I feel How do you cultivate that I mean I think we could raise children in a way where that was the default state We don't but I think that's a possible thing for people who Have already been conditioned to see everything as separate things and are having to recondition that Yeah, I think time not just in nature but in wilderness particularly if you can get an old growth Right where you can because a young forest does not have the complexity that's been clear cut and regrown with a few species of tree Does not have the complexity of an old growth forest doesn't do the same thing if you can get deep into wilderness and spend enough time there and enough silence um A tremendous amount of transformation in your mind and being starts to happen And a tremendous amount of understanding about things so I think That's about as good as anything um I think you know when I said psychedelics There are lots of experiences that can induce states that change the nature of perception through fasting through vision quests through sweat lodges through, you know Medicines are one of them, but uh Inducing states in which your perception of reality is experientially very different can help people realize more in a more embodied way How limited their perceptional space usually it's And the thing that I had said then about relationships Yeah, I think really uh deeply loving more beings really helps And in really deeply loving them seeking to understand them and imagine what it's like to be them and realize that you don't know But really try to try to feel what it's like to be other beings um Your own ego can't actually imagine what it's like to be other beings Because it's its own set of things like to really take on what it's like to be them The part of me that the the aspect of me that can do that is not my identity. It's something deeper than identity and um And the pattern of putting myself at the center all the time Is very transcended in that process There's a bunch of other things for this a few Um, so the next question we have is from hogan williams So i'm someone who's deeply concerned about the sense-making crisis aspect of all of this Addressing sense-making seems to call for humility listening and slow process Yet addressing existential risk seems to call for boldness prophetic speech and action over contemplation At least that would be one way to slice it. You may deconstruct that It seems that if we have one without the other we are likely lost Yet they seem so different as to be working at cross purposes Can you speak to this tension between contemplation and boldness? These divergent approaches and how might wisely weave them? Yeah, totally. Um Everybody's familiar with the dunning kruger curve Uh this idea and sociology i'll explain it that When someone doesn't know anything about a field They can actually have a lot of unearned confidence in their ideas about the space because they're not aware of how much stuff they don't know and Then as they start to study the field they their confidence drops radically because All the things that were in the unknown unknown for them move into the known unknown. They're like shit. There's so much stuff I don't know and so It is common that people who have Much less depth of thought have more confidence on a topic and people have more confidence Understand how complex the thing is the idea of the dunning kruger curve as you start here And then as you gain more knowledge you drop and then you slowly kind of come back up as you gain expertise what I find is in Trying to not study a specialty where I can eventually know most of the field I got my phd and it whatever but In trying to study the nature of reality and trying to study how to make a big difference in the world My uh Sense of how much I know just keeps dropping forever the more I The more I learn the more things i'm aware really matter that I don't know continuously so um Uh, I don't I don't think you ever end up getting something like a similar type of confidence I think what you get is a place where You understand a topic well enough to know that your best ideas might not only be wrong but even harmful And yet you're pretty clear that your assessment is factoring more things than the other assessments that are currently running the world And so there's an obligation to start to act but not with confidence more with like a Sacred obligation that Feels It doesn't feel like egoic a empowered agency. Fuck I got this. I know what to do. I'm gonna go solve this thing I'm gonna crusade doesn't feel like that. It feels like really fucking scared to fuck stuff up And really continuously listening um and So That's my sense is that if you are trying to address nuclear risk Or ai risk or whatever and you proceed confidently you'll almost certainly make it worse Which is almost always the case So you want if you don't have good sense making about the cause of the issues and how The nature of what you I mean Classically It's not just you can optimize for a project and end up externalizing harmels or what happens all the time It's things like you create a movement the movement becomes very effective But it appeals to some people and actually anti appeals to other people So you drive the counter movement. It's called schismogenesis and so Uh Has the like racial justice movement enlightened everybody No, the anti woke culture actually emerged as a counter response to the nature of how kind of woke social justice moved forward and Every time the way that reparations were talked about Uh was expressed that did not do good sense making about how that would appeal to everybody a lot more people joined the far Are alt right and things like that so um if you Want to actually make things better in the death hing it says uh The master navigates the world as careful as one walking on black ice And what I like about that so much is if you're walking on black ice You don't have to want to split your head open just the the tiniest lapse of awareness and you can split your head open And so recognizing that navigating the world is like walking on black ice, especially if you try to do things at scale But it also doesn't say the master stays at home because there's black ice. He's navigating the world But it is full and it's not full of fearfulness. It's full of carefulness the depth of care Yes Yeah, so I think we've got one last one from the folks who wrote any questions and then we've got um Uh all I think seven six hands raised hands raised so hopefully we can get to everybody. Um I want to turn finally to Pamela Haynes Pamela. Do you want to unmute and ask your question? Sure. Yeah, thank you. I think that some of my question got answered by your response to mich and um Keith's suggestion that people speak that you speak to hope in response to everything. I'll just leave that part of it out So my question is really simple and it's what do you love? And I can't answer that very well um Because it because it is definitely beyond words I I love reality And all of the unique expressions Um If you like if you were to ask what motivates My work like what I'm working for I'm not working for the end of AI arms races or nuclear races or to get the chemicals out of the ocean or like I mean, yes, those are specific things, but um I I close my eyes I meditate and I see kids playing in the future I see them and I see through their eyes and I see them learning to climb a tree for the first time and loving trees I see them falling in love for the first time. I see them doing aw at sunsets I see the mom falling in love with them. I see them learning to communicate with animals And just that that gets to continue is what I love and I'm in service to All the rest is complicated strategy in service to that And for the non-human world as much as the human world Daniel film Daniel brilliant presentation I'm a scholar of the relationship between the sciences and the world's religious and spiritual traditions From that perspective, it struck me. It's really interesting the the pattern or the formal analysis of your presentation Which is you gave us the facts the situations the background You gave us the the practices that people engage in psychedelics meditation and so forth You brought those two right next to each other Keith and I and many people on this call engage in a kind of reflection right there at that meeting point of the two You engage in almost no reflection at that particular point. You spoke of actions and facts wishes visions But surely there's a kind of reflection That is right at that intersection I have the intuition that you'd be able to help us If you sort of open up the doors to that particular room, I'm interested to see how you respond to that invitation Yeah, you mean specifically at the intersection of something like the sciences and spirituality Right, which is a kind of self-involving intersection You often answer like a religious studies scholar, which is what my tribe does and describes externally powerful internal experiences But there's a kind of internally driven reflection that stems from the motivation or the psychedelic experiences And you're surprisingly silent at that that intersection point The um when I when I was growing up I was um homeschooled and I studied I had a Got to make my own curriculum didn't have a fixed curriculum and The kind of braid of topics of interest was all the sciences all of the kind of spiritual mystical traditions and philosophic traditions and um And then also the kind of all the domains of uh activism And they all felt like the exact same thing to me. I had the same And And particularly because at that time growing up in the 80s And what just a fortune of getting exposed to like my exposure to science was first fritchoff capra and david boom and Like the whole idea that something at the nature of ecology and complexity science and quantum mechanics would reveal the perennial truths of the spiritual traditions and things like that So I didn't get science as kind of reductionist atheism first. I got the critique of that first and um There's a Paper I wrote maybe Keith will share it with people called The dance of the dow and the 10,000 things and because you know The dow that is nameable is not the eternal dow Naming is the beginning of the 10,000 things typically we take it that then Engagement with the 10,000 things deadens us to the dow But it doesn't have to it can do the exact opposite right it can actually Deep in the nature of the appreciation of the dow that's what I meant by the dance between them and uh so one of the areas that I really got into was uh limits of no ability and whether it was kind of girdle and mathematics or the incompleteness theorem or uh tarski with the limits of formal logic or um Heisenberg bell, you know on and on there's these kind of Pearson semiotics the upper bounds of no ability are ways that logic can transcend itself because it can identify its formal upper boundaries and then identify how much of reality is outside of it And then there's the question. Well, what is the right epistemology for that then? What is the right way to relate to it? Um, so there's like these are some of my favorite topics. There's a lot I could say there I'm not sure exactly which part of the inquiry is um, Most interesting and live for you, but it would be a fun conversation At some point I look forward to that there is a way to speak at precisely that intersection point Which is not just silence and many of the hundred people on this call are practiced in that I would love to in in explore that openness To a form of discourse that was surprisingly silent Over the last hour. Thanks again for your talk Yeah, well, that's really lovely film. I really love that invitation. Um, and I hope that connection happens um Stan I got Stan's message and I don't know if Stan's here, but he wrote it to me in the chat So I'm going to go ahead and just read it out. Um, we have you mentioned population collapse and tainter's analysis Four or five groups of ecologists have estimated that the world can only sustain Sustainably support three or four billion people at a reasonable standard living i.e. the european standard Given we are at eight billion now. This is not a small problem Given this what is your prognosis on collapse or not in the years and decades ahead? Um prognosis on collapse includes population as one factor but lots of other factors um The topic of caring capacity is a very tricky topic It's very tricky for like so many reasons Caring capacity meaning how many people can the earth sustainably? uh support um The answer that comes up most commonly is like two three billion but uh the numbers vary from 500 000 to tens of billions depending upon how people do the analysis um Obviously before the industrial revolution I mean 500 million excuse me before the industrial revolution the population of the planet was 500 million and then It went from 500 million to 8 billion almost overnight right to 200 years with the haverbosch and such But as it did that as it's 16 that 16 x would have taken over 200 000 years to get in 200 years It also increased the resource consumption per capita by about 100 x in the developed world So that's obviously a 1600 x increase in um resource consumption How you define it though is What is the most number of people you can possibly fit on the planet without collapsing the biosphere versus what provides the highest quality of life for all life including non-humans um Mediated through what kind of technologies gets into deep cultural questions of what a desirable good life looks like um And the enactment pathway of getting there Is super tricky because the conversations almost always turn into eugenics and war and like pretty pretty difficult stuff um and If you look at the work of like Um I'm forgetting his name right now. It'll come to me in a minute But you know elan has talked about this Uh popularly a lot recently which is that um the topic of demographic collapse that the decreasing birth rates in china in particular but all around the world are Going to destroy civilization as we know it not the biosphere because a smaller percentage of young people entering the workforce military force, etc and a lot of old people Is not how civilization is designed to function um and so And that's obviously because we built a civilizational system that is incommensurable the biosphere So the ongoing needs that it has for maintenance like growing gdp and growing population upon which it was predicated don't work with the biosphere so um Is population a topic that we have to figure out? Yes, it's a it's a it's a very tricky one So I don't like to try to say much definitive about it quickly When china tried to control its population growth To the one child policy or when india tried to control it Some of the unintended side effects were things like over a hundred million too many men Because they emphasize male children and now you have literally over a hundred million more men than women that can't mate that are destabilizing civilization and so like the You always have the what is the ideal in state you have whose ideal which cultural ethical models and then you have the enactment to get there And well, you know, there's a bunch of libertarian thought that is gibberish one of the libertarian Questions that is often useful is, you know, think about your utopia In the future Think about all the people that don't want it right now that would violently resist it because of their different religious ideas or economic interests or whatever And think about how much violence you would have to enact to force your utopia on them and ask if it's still utopia And so the considerations about enactment are very real I Know, um, Stan pretty well. I'm sure Stan's got a lot to say particularly on that topic of There's a there's a qe w pamphlet critiquing. He's a you know, a demographer beginning the which college but Uh, critiquing the the elan analysis. So I'm sure he might want to share at with you afterwards, but I would love I would love to see that analysis I think it desperately needs critiqued Yeah Oh, yeah Great great job on the geopolitical understanding. Um, I'm really impressed with the depth of your knowledge and the realism of your perspective I've been following Peter Zion and many other geopolitical thinkers sure many was the one I was about to mention who has been popularizing the demographic collapse So thanks for mentioning it. That was the name I was forgetting. Yep, and I'm well aware of the mit study of You know, very they tracked I forgot like six major Measures and how they would change over the next century Um, I I was exposed to this at university of colorado boulder while studying geology and economics in geology is kind of a hotbed of The counter perspective on a lot of these things because uh, we know the paleo climate very well. We know My professors have been unerringly accurate about predicting how the climate is going to change Which goes to say, um, the climate is a lot bigger problem. It's going to cause big migrations all over the place It's going to change the rules all over the place Um, the scientific humidity is just not up to the task of conveying news of that magnitude Especially when the rate of change is faster than a peer review process will allow So if you passed over the peer review process about five years ago My question though has to do with the longevity and retirement aspects because We live a lot longer And I remember a discussion at the university of colorado 42 years ago where they talk about how that would fragment our society um and It kind of creates this dynamic to say the emphasis is really going to be on the government to take charge and Clear a path for the future There's kind of limits to what you can do as far as social involvement. Could you speak to that? How we economically support an increasing growth, uh, elderly population. Is that the main question? Well, it's that That there's genetically engineered, uh, pig organs that stands to increase life expectancy another decade or two Um, you know stem cell inserts is all this technology to say we're going to live increasingly into our hundreds Roughly some 80 percent of the federal budget is now devoted to retirement in some way or another saving for retirement or retirement itself And so you're you're you're kind of say if we're going to have a massive social limit to change society You're at some point going to run head-on into the cost of return the fact that we live longer. Yeah um Just having a conversation right before this, um the colleague about the uh collapsing pensions and Again realist analysis everybody who studies this knows that the growing debt to gdp ratio is not there's no path to fix it and the growing not just debt but deficit spending um Also hitting diminishing returns on so many areas of industry because of planetary boundaries coming up climate change and others means, uh, the imminent break of the economic system as we know it um When you mentioned climate and the climate predictions, obviously you look at like the jim Hansen recently said tin celsius is now the most likely scenario um and you look at the uh You know fact that the climate sensitivity numbers and some of the best models have went way up and are like actually being underreported because not wanting to sound alarmist but even the un predictions are billion climate refugees in the next 10 years and when you look at where they come from if you look at the Himalayan watershed and You know India with over a billion people china with over a billion people in pakistan and then the islamic world backing it with over a billion people on a dwindling water supply where a lot of those 100 million person plus climate migrations will occur all of which are nuclear equipped with massive geopolitical tensions. It's not just like Some people die from that. It's like disruption of the entire world system. Um so I think I think that we don't continue to see business as usual, uh into the uh decade ahead in retirement as a part of that Yeah, I would just add um north america has a radically different fate than asia and um north america we don't have these existential problems and we've got oceans to protect us I mean there's a limited amount of threat you can convey over an ocean So I want to jump in I just want to make sure that we have um some time for uh, in particular, I noticed we've had an all men audience uh or question Asking for so far. So I know we have uh two men and two women left and I want to give precedence to the To jenny and shelly So jenny if you would like to ask your question now and then um, we can spin back around Is um, I it's not particularly a woman's question, but nevertheless I will I wanted to try to bring us back to the question that I'm actually finding it very difficult to articulate so please forgive me um The the question of love at the root of of our response to this crisis and you So a couple of things one is that I I think that what you were saying earlier daniel about One of the one of the primary things that's gone Gone wrong and I'm a scientist and I've been trying to deal with the integration of science and spirituality and and technology and economics and the whole thing for many many years so trying to see the roots of these things is is is um leads you to a place where You're you're faced with uncertainty and radical humility. So let's start there, but the sense of separation to me is allied to a corresponding faith in our In justifying justifying our actions, which which um, I I don't really explain that at the moment, but We are we have a moral ground for our being that co exists with our egotistical power sense and our um Our ability to justify what we're doing in terms of violence and so on so I wanted to ask you about how you see Love as as a guiding principle for how we can act in this complex world that we're now living in because When we talk about our faith tradition as quakers We're often looking towards our conscience our spirit And that spirit is also the the the ground of love for life truth that the truth of our unity And the and that which guides us into doing action whether or not we really can be certain of the outcome Does that make some sort of sense? Yeah, totally um I don't think we can ever be certain of the outcome right I I don't think that we shouldn't try to engage in Uh, you just went away to look at you while you were talking I guess not so I'm here. There you are. Okay. Um I Think that consequentialist ethics have a role Where you think through what will provide the greatest good for the greatest many and you try to think through the causal dynamics of it But uh consequentialist ethics on their own ends up generally making people evil Because you pretend that you have more certainty about the future state than you possibly can You identify certain bad things that are inevitable which justifies why you have to do some other bad things because they're less bad And so the basis of that is actually the excessive certainty that isn't epistemically warranted, which is why the epistemic humility is so important So there is a there's a kind of virtue ethic, which is I don't know how the future is going to unfold There's unpredictable complexity everywhere But I know that the choices that have the most integrity in the moment put out the kind of ripples that will ripple well Right, so that's kind of a virtue ethic There's kind of a utilitarian ethic that tries to think through what is a viable in-state here What is a viable or at least new homeodynamic state and can I reverse engineer steps? They're both important right And then there's something that is kind of deeper than either of those even deeper than the virtue ethic which is uh Something like the feeling guidance that comes from deep enough prayer And again, that's all the aspects of self being involved As far as love at the basis I think if anyone really explores why they are motivated to do something There's it's not purely a rational thing Because a purely rational thing doesn't actually have motive. It doesn't care, right? Like there are some basis for care Otherwise it'd be like well, if this doesn't happen then this thing will be harmed But if I don't care about that thing being harmed who cares, right? So like in a purely rationalist Ontology then I'm being nihilistic So I want to change this because this is horrifying Because I'm fucking pissed that they're doing this because I'm heartbroken over here. Well, but any of those emotions I'm heartbroken because there is some these kids lives in Gaza these animals in the factory farm Are beautiful they're sacred which is why I care So underneath the heartbreak and underneath the anger and underneath the depression and the devastation underneath all of the sense of Injustice is actually love because if I didn't find some reality beautiful That I loved there would be no basis for the other emotions So that the idea that all of the other emotions are actually responses to love to care Then you recognize the anger the sadness the depression the anxiety are all actually sacred They all have a place but they're not at the source. So you embrace them and then you trace them back to where they come from When you trace them back to where they come from rather than being angry at who the bad guy is what I love becomes clear and then That is actually an even deeper motive and then how Do I be effective in service of what I love is a clearer focus? So it's just the deep reflection on what the motivation is and tracing it back to the source right and I I agree and I think it's also that You know love love is one of the most misunderstood words and most Misunderstood concepts. It's overused and underused all the time But it's also to me the great attractor what I call the great attractor. So it actually applies to science as well It's not it's not a it's not a there's not a place where love doesn't exist In this whole concept, you know, and it can it can be the root of guiding very very practical action It doesn't have to be something that oh, this is just a feeling state or this is just the way quakers talk or something like that It's actually the concept of oh total unity. It's a unified consciousness. If you like Yes Reminds me of the harmony of the spheres and you know, uh, Daniel has a beautiful talk on emergence that um, if you Want to look that up on youtube at some point. Daniel talks about something very similar to what you just said, jenny But um, shelly, I would like to invite you to ask your question Thank you and I appreciate the opportunity Daniel, I really um I learned from I want to take us back to some of the things you said at the beginning your analysis of the different Factors you you mentioned three different factors that motivate individuals and society to and And determine whether we're effective or not and and as I understood it one of them was Understanding how the world works and the other has the second has to do with your ethics or whether you care about The global world or not And and third was an effective strategy to Take action And if I I'm not sure I got that all that right, but if that's Correct, um I find that most of the people if not all of them on this on these screens Are pretty well versed in the first one how to you know, how messed up our world is And the second one all deeply caring and wanting to make the world a better place Um, so going beyond their own personal Satisfaction and needs to wanting to to create a better world But what we mostly almost all of us fail is we don't know what to do about it We don't have an effective strategy and I think you've kind of answered With your answer to jenny, but I wonder if you could reiterate it in another way So like we all understand What are the best? Strategies for us to figure out what is an effective strategy and not just individually But how can we collectively as a quaker community take action? Is this being Posted on the internet That was the intention, but if you want to cut anything I don't know. I don't know where you're gonna go, but I we can totally work out whenever Feels feels good there Okay In a different setting I can say more about this I'll say a couple things The Study of effective strategy is different in kind than studying like environmentalism and the fact that the environment's messed up It because you're studying How power works and you're studying it not just to critique it but to engage in it And so that is a very different kind of study It looks at how is it that corporations are able to lobby governments and put Corporate agents into regulatory positions to regulate the government and their interests and things like that and all those critiques of that the Rotating revolving doors of somebody from big ag or big pharma than running the fda and you know Or the public private partnership where the private side writes the law that the public side implements Or the massive subsidies to fairly toxic things that happen because the big companies that have the patents have the money to pay a lot More lobbyists than the things that are inherently decentralized like regenerative versus conventional agriculture or whatever There's the way the critical theorist studies this which is basically to just say it's really bad Like look at all this bad stuff. It's really bad There there is the way that one studies it from the perspective of How does Influence at scale operate? What are the various Modalities that when the world has changed who changed it and what were the tools they used to change it? And if Someone does not Feel good about using those tools they counter as they have to say do I feel good about letting those who are using the tools currently continue to do it for those goals? so Being able to lobby a government for subsidies that ends up affecting Market dynamics profoundly is something that big corporations are good at and that Non-profit groups are not good at Non-profit groups don't study how finance works and how lobbying works and you know those types of things well Being able to figure out how to write a very complex Operating agreement for a public-private partnership that has all the fine print to do everything you want for many different government Jurisdictional bodies are now doing your will is something that the financial sector and various large corporate sectors are very good at and You know people trying to do good things are not good at um and so If you want effective strategy you have to study effective strategy And so let's say for instance i'll give a historical example And it's it's a fake example, but it'll you'll get a sense Let's say that we had a chance to talk to The Tibetans before Mao and they did let's say we had a chance to talk to them a couple decades before They were not studying effective strategy because that was not their jam That was not what their culture was about right they were doing different things and they were doing lovely things They obviously did not study that And the results are also quite obvious Now If they were to think about geopolitical strategy for a minute It would be pretty easy to say oh There are two billion person populations on either side of a watershed and we are at the source of the watershed I bet we don't get to stay here Like it seems pretty obvious that we don't get to stay here one of these sides is going to take the head Top of the watershed. Also, this is going to be key to the strategic communications and missile defense so Geographically the fate is already written that we don't get to stay here Given that what should we do and either They would have done something like Uh, anticipatorily create a partnership with one of the sides In which they had something unique to offer They would have left Or they would have done something like finlanded between the ussr and eu to be in a Buffer zone relationship where both sides militarily protected them because of that or like switzerland did to say, you know all of the international agreements between the two of you were going to be able to host and So let's say that Tibet had realized that 30 years before the kind of rise of Mao and they had went to The european powers at the time and said look, here's what's going to happen China's going to get this otherwise And it's going to help their rise to power that is going to end up threatening you and blah blah blah And here's why you want to help protect us like offer kind of military legal support protecting us here And then here's how what we're going to tell india here's what we're going to tell china such that in the same way that nobody Invaded switzerland because everybody was invested in being able to store their gold and stuff in switzerland because switzerland was thinking about strategy Then tibet could have done that This would not have been this would have not arisen from the minds of the tibetan people with the culture they had It did arise from the minds of some religions like jews, right? They had a different they had a Different type of spirituality and mind arising that thought about strategy in a different way So It's not that there aren't places like tibet that had the same geographical determination that Did a better job than they did it said it required a different type of mind And that as as i've mentioned the people who are good at strategy Are almost always strategy is a military term it gets then gets applied to business and other things, but it is about Effective achieving of goals which are almost always narrow goals where you externalize costs in the process and against adversaries right like that's so The mind that gets good at strategy Is almost always co-occurring with something that is self-centered either at the level of the individual the nation state the corporation but not The commons in all life and perpetuity When you're thinking about the commons in all life and perpetuity you're not thinking how do I win stuff? and so but it's kind of like let's Let's take star wars Let's say there were no sith right There wouldn't have to be jedi if there were no sith Everybody could just be farmers and poets and parents and teachers would be lovely But if there are sith there must be jedi and the jedi are not trained in farming. They are trained in warfare protective warfare right um not in service of empire and conquest purely like the white blood cells and immune system and So what I would say is if you Want to be effective At serving things that you care about in the presence of other groups that are effective at serving the goals they care about You need to engage in that field of study The jury Yeah, what was that? It's almost as if what you're saying is that In order to be effective We need to let go of our ethics because in order to be effect the way you're most effective is by being um self-serving and you know with a narrow focus So there's a real problem. I'm not saying that Okay I'm saying that it is inethical to do something that you know is for sure ineffective To let uh Horror and tragedy and species extinction continue because you aren't willing to engage in effective strategies unethical we are responsible not just for what we do but what we don't do and So there is an ethical responsibility to effectiveness That doesn't mean you justify any amount of harm in the process. I'm not and that's the tricky thing is that the The cultures That Said okay, we don't want wiped out therefore we have to build a standing military or whatever We're not the same culture anymore because they had to reinvest things that had went into Arts and child education and whatever now into military and and those types of things so The two fail modes that we have to avoid is Uh a culture that is doing something that is more Ethical in its goals that just gets destroyed by a more dominant culture. That's a fail mode Or even if it doesn't get destroyed because no one cares about it because it has no power but it it Fails to prevent harm in the rest of the world happening That's a fail mode and one the other fail mode is that in the aim of Not being destroyed and being effective. It also becomes a dominated culture That's also a fail mode So you can either be destroyed by the machine or become the machine is the answer So you have to do something that is neither of those So in learning how to be effective obviously the long-term Play there is a change of all of the systems that mediate game theory itself The consciousness and the systems which will look like not capitalism not nation states and not minds that see everything as separate things But we don't get there if we don't if right now everybody That is effectively getting lawmakers to write law or doing it in narrow short-term private interests I would rather environmentalists know how to do the corporate thing as well as the corporate guys do Or a different set of purposes Well, of course, I would like to have a government that is not hijackable by anybody's interests And that has a good collective intelligence guiding it. We obviously don't have that so having The more inclusive goals be effective in the current dynamics while seeking to upgrade the underlying systemic dynamics Both have to happen simultaneously It's a tall order Yeah, well, thank you for now being effective At a local level is different because you don't have great power vested interests in the same way And that's awesome And I encourage most people to actually feel really good about that as opposed to hopeless about the scale that it's not operating at And For those who can't not think about the world at scale and can't not Endeavour to become more effective at it It's just a different study Thank you Daniel for sharing that and Yeah, I think that a core tenant of quakerism is about is about peace, right? I'm guessing you might have ran across that, you know, so from the 1650s onward is this sort of testimony on peace and so There's much more to endeavor into there, but And into that so let me give you for instance Yeah So the nuclear clock got Moved closer to midnight Associated with the escalation in ukraine Yeah You have not heard A good thought on a plausible end game When you watch the news because there is not one The there is On one side a bunch of rhetoric Like putin is hitler and if he takes part of ukraine then Bad guys everywhere will start taking other places and he'll take all of Europe and whatever and this is why we have to But there's no thought about What okay, so we're closing Possible de-escalation pathways. What is the end game that we're going towards instead? And engaging with this pretty directly. I can tell you that there's very wacky conversations about our first strike nuclear dominance And stuff like that so If you Are focused on peace. It's not just we don't want to wage war It's that we want to be effective at de-escalating everyone who is waging war and there are increasingly hawkish people on all sides Absolutely So learn how to be effective at influencing what is happening at the level of national security councils Yeah to be able to have the more de-escalatory voices get into more positions of power and the escalatory hawkish voices not be there so it It takes a particular But unless you know how to talk to security councils in language that will move them Then you don't have the ability to help de-escalation in those ways or the other forces that you'd need to work with so the like I think One time when I was like nine years old I Had an experience probably many people here have had where I was horrified at my inability to not cause harm that I I couldn't avoid When I was walking on the grass maybe killing some bugs. I couldn't I at least my nine-year-old mind the mites that were destroyed with my breath and my eyelash flutters You know, it was just like so kind of horrifying. So I was like just stood there frozen didn't want to move Wanted to breathe the little as possible and Okay, I realized I have to breathe and move but really tried to think about how do I not cause any harm and I'm complicit with all these systems that are Fundamentally ecocidal and genocidal to be able to just get my stuff right and even if I'm eating a vegetarian diet but The shipping processes the oil that was involved in shipping at everything, right? There's like there's Blood in all of that stuff and so I'm like, okay, so I have to only have things I make myself from stuff that I find and The idea that then for me to have my hands clean. I'm not causing harm Also means I am totally complicit in allowing all the harm of the system to happen because I'm not willing to interact with any of it There's a kind of humility that says no, I'm going to drive a car with fossil fuels that Not only are destroying the environment but create wars that kill children That I am partly driving the demand for Then there is a place where like you don't I don't get to have my hands clean in this world I do my very best but There's a humility in that that's important. There's a realism in it. That's important There's a not superiority over everybody else just being like we're in this thing together At this time. That's the time that we're in And then say like if I'm a pacifist I'm not the one who controls the nuclear buttons I'm not the one who controls the rapid proliferation of drone weapons If I'm really a pacifist meaning I don't want there to be Killing anywhere. How do I become increasingly influential over the people who are in control of the nuclear buttons and who are building all of the AI empowered drone weapons But that means maybe I have to learn how to engage compellingly with places that I would rather never engage with Well, we've got two more questions and I want to kind of finish out with those I think we'll we'll finish here at uh six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern Um, so David, I want to give you an opportunity and then Eric and then Daniel any closing words? Hi, greetings Daniel and everyone from Wajak Nga Buja in Western Australia, where it's now 8 53 a.m. Saturday morning And it does make me think of Edward Wilson's classic line. You know, we have a paleolithic emotions medieval institutions and godlike technology So I did enjoy your talk very much Daniel and I love that you refer to sort of evolution or at least cultural evolution And I have great respect for the United States of America two years away from your declaration of independence And um, you know, essentially founding a republic So it's pretty amazing for me living in what is a fairly robust democracy here Um, but I do Dothma cap at America's abilities. Uh, so in terms of evolutionary Perspectives, I mean, I I remember in the early 90s after the collapse of the Berlin Wall One of the classic lines was because we went from two superpowers to the one superpower And one of the classic lines was, you know, the new world superpower is global public opinion And uh, now it's a little bit more mixed up, but I'm just wondering overall What you think of the prospects of democracy modern representative democracy, which of course is nothing like ancient greek democracy Not good Um You just went away again, why do people go away right after they talk? I can all go ahead and um I'm here. I'm still here. I'm still all right. So, um It's a long complicated answer, but when The u.s. Democracy was founded We did have an ocean separating us And so the idea that the There were a few things but one the idea that the people could know Everything so they could be democratically, um, you know, participatory Once we started to get the telegraph and then kind of mass telecommunications and then, um Satellite spying sig intel and hypersonic missiles Anything the american public know the russians the chinese the iranians instantly know That means you started having a situation where almost everything became a national security secret and could not be shared with the public or even got congress mostly Because where the fertilizer is stored is a is a weapons knowledge where the aquifers are where the so increasingly The most critical information can never be known by the public because it's national security secrets That's you can't run a democracy where you have to classify everything um And yet you also can't make have a world that is in that kind of warfare where you share all of the things that Are national security secrets with the public, you know, that's one example of a context change In which the ideas that kind of made sense just totally don't make sense The thing that we call the democracy obviously did all of its labor with slavery and which means that all the shit jobs that people had no boat in and Then we kind of got rid of that obviously After the emancipation proclamation, we didn't really get rid of slavery We just got a p and h slavery system where we put people in jail for for false reasons and then you know forced labor out of them We really only got rid of it when we when globalization allowed us to ship the slavery overseas and by the step back and effectively and You know, so if you were to say Can a democracy make the decisions where the totality of the decisions it's of everyone that it's affecting all have a voice All the stakeholders have a voice that's never happened right so A country will look at its genie coefficient and say what the inequality is but it buys its stuff from a country Where almost everybody is poor In which case it depends upon so the only level at which genie coefficient makes sense is global Right, the only there's so many things like that where you really have to think about that Which you depend upon and are driving the supply and demand of so um If if you really look at did we ever have democracy? There was actually a thing where the stakeholders that were being affected really had any say it's not it's not a very good analysis and then when you say Does the thing that we have now even resemble the elements of that totally not Now Uh, how do you deal with that moving forward? There is no system of governance in the history of the world that can deal with the issues that we need to deal with now Because Or instance Uh gene synthesizers are becoming cheaper on an exponential curve And it is already the case that quite inexpensively you can get the ability for gene synthesis and amplification and It's a couple couple years at the current rate away from incredibly cheap like desktop capability for everybody So if you even have open publishing of science Where the science is doing gain and function research to look at incredibly variable empathogens and you publish the genome sequence The information file alone, which is now open published on the internet is enough to make catastrophe weapons And you can't monitor and control that the way you can nukes because nukes obviously are very very hard to make and you can see The facilities the uranium enrichment etc from space But we're talking about devices anybody can have in a tiny basement lab And so that either means you You just stop science mostly Because it's all Pandora's boxes Or you stop open publishing Totally in the proper idea of kind of democracy there because the knowledge itself has weaponizable applications of that scale Or you get increasing Truly global catastrophes or you create a massive surveillance state Those all are bad There are better answers, but they're not obvious. They require innovation and totally new types of governance Governance of lots of things. So, you know, those are things we work on but um, I Don't think that there are any systems of governance known to dates that can deal with these kinds of issues I Yeah, thank you so much here. I'm gonna unspotlight folks real quick. Um And you know, we're coming in right here on the end of our conversation. I know Eric Eric, I know well, uh, has a question raised if it's quick, Eric If you still want to ask it go ahead and ask and then, um, daniel can share some closing thoughts So, um, in fact, shelly asked very similar question to what I was going to ask and I do want to thank you for your answers to the questions afterwards because their monologue seem to have been a um, basically a list And it includes numbers like, you know, the however many people the Mongols killed and how much money is being put into ai which Are are nice to know, but I think you could assume that the people in this audience Have been working on the basic questions for a long time So my hypothetical hypothetical question is suppose we all knew Everything that you had to say except for those little numbers What would you say instead? It's always hard to talk to an audience that you don't know what is shared knowledge Um, what's shared world view? It's always a tricky tricky thing. Um So my Uh ideal situation is To get to understand what a group is working on like what the shared knowledge is and what they're already working on together and what things Would be useful or empowering for them. What are the things that they're working on and then see do I know anything? It would be useful. Maybe you don't um You know, it could be things about Uh Pathways of enacting solutions like specific strategies for enactment could be things about prioritization of amongst all the problematic things which ones make sense to sequence attention on it could be um deepening the understanding of the problem assessment in terms of the causal dynamics more such that Um clear insight about what the effective kinds of strategies would be But it would depend upon what was already known and what wasn't and what was interesting And Well, Daniel, we might need to talk more at some point But uh, I just uh want to give you a chance. Uh, it's uh 904 your time I know, um, but do you want to share some closing thoughts with with the group here? I I was um I didn't know who was in the group uh beforehand, you know, and you invited me here. I was uh uh Happy to see how many people were scientists and where people who've been working on these issues for a long time knew Uh a lot about it. I um That's not the case of faith communities in general. Um, so I think that's awesome if there was a Follow-up of okay, let's kind of share What our state-of-the-world assessment is and what our current thoughts for how to what we care to do and how we Think about how to enact that are and be able to engage there. That would be really interesting um and Uh, if there are people who are like have backgrounds and things and are working on things that feel like there are Interesting follow-ups we might engage in if Keith maybe you send me a list about of that and that would also be really cool Definitely will do. Yeah. Well, maybe we can end with some stillness and getting back in touch with that sacred center and Thank you so much Daniel for sharing your thoughts. I would like to hear the harvest From this so if some of you stay and continue to talk Keith if you would share um harvest and there are interesting follow-ups to the intersection of the um kind of spirituality that is not incommensurable with any other worldview or religion that has uh In sacredness listening conscience at the center that also has environmentally interested people and scientists like this is Really delightful. I'm really happy to have met the people here and so I look forward to hearing more Thanks All right, so um the folks who are staying I um Want to just share with you all um the queries that we have uh, if this is not like I think any time with queries It's really where's spirit drawing us? But the questions I've written ahead of time are how might QEW as an organization respond with deep earnestness to the crisis we face today Given Daniel's talk what new insights or challenges are we seeing? And three how might our Quaker faith inspire us in taking on our civilization all right at that? So I'll drop those in the chat and then I just want to invite folks to start raising their hands and maybe once five hands are up um So I'll drop those in the chat and then uh as folks are led just raise your hands and we can begin this discussion Thank you so much everyone I'll note as someone who really loves Daniel's analysis that i'm like A little nervous because he does get laid something laid on pretty heavy sometimes But I think it's really important for us to actually um as people who are called to spirituality not to avoid those facts But to to really face up to them and ask a couple of us what conscience How conscience would have have us respond? so at that Just waiting for hands. We got four hands and Yeah, five Okay, or four, but anyway story if you want to go ahead and start us off Yeah, I I can only speak to number two because i'm i'm lutheran And I have a very different um Well, let's just say we do things a little differently Um same general idea. Love your neighbor. Love god with all your heart mind and soul The the thought that occurred to me is I as having deep roots in the scientific community Going back over 50 years uh, I'm I'm Feel motivated to say how can we kind of merge these points of use? And for example in the geologic view, there's the oceanographers. There's the astrophysicist. There's the geochemists There's the paleoclimatologist There's all these sub branches all the way going down to high temperature superconductors because that's part of the same physics And so we know we're very good at working with other groups and seeing things from their point of view because they're all valid And together you you kind of get a broader more deeper perspective Because I I heard very solid analysis from daniel on geopolitics and the reality of certain government interactions and you know history but there's a There's a climate aspect that is not well socialized There are our demographic aspects that are not well socialized. My wife is from taiwan And having that kind of personal connection You notice things they don't publish because they're right there in front of you on the ground And i'm just wondering where would it be best to kind of fuse those perspectives into a greater one because I really firmly believe if you're going to make wise powerful decisions, you gotta know what you face Hey Ronnie, I think you know, I think everyone can see this list and if we um Yeah, so um, we'll try to I see your hand raised. Don't worry. Ronnie. You want to respond? for sure I do, um I mean I pushed back at the end because Not everybody here is a scientist and I sure as hell don't want to be in a a group with just scientists There's people like me who are more social scientists and and the strategist for Community organizing and all of that kind of thing and so, you know I one of the things that I find is, you know, we are I don't think we have Some of the answers we truly need and and yet I also bring a strong native american orientation to this and You know, we can do this from a um Whatever this is, I mean native peoples have been, you know, destroyed For centuries and and whatnot. So it's nothing new I think, you know, it just to put that into a perspective and I think it's, you know I was fascinated with the elder discussion because that's an area where I have a High a law, you know, a large expertise and and cooperative structures that we're a bunch of older people in this country And we could start playing and organize around how we're going to take care of ourselves So that burden isn't on the younger generation But we did talk about there being guidance from younger people and some of the younger people are starting to organize for What do we do after things break down? So, you know, I just um I don't think we're going to come to terms with it scientifically I sure don't think we're going to come to terms with it if we do a whole bunch of philosophizing I think we've got to Hit the ground with our boots on Whatever that is I I just want to invite folks who have their hand raised just speak in order that your hands are raised. Um Yeah So that's jenny jenny wrackliffe right now Uh, I I just want to mention a couple of things and and because I spoke earlier. I'll be quick That there are several examples. I can think of Of given given that you're number two and number three keys I look to people like e f shoe marker gandy Martin Luther king And and others that some of us are already familiar with as to how we can actually build a bridge between the spiritual root and our This transformation that we're trying to bring about at the deepest possible level and turn that into practical action and when gandy Made the savo dear movement in in india I think as much as the satyagraha movement where he was is which he's known for about peacemaking and and and An indian liberation from the british and so on um his his practical program of of appropriate technology Deep economy deep deep ecology in effect thomas berry spoke to this and We're we're trying to integrate those things in our own lives. I think I mean daniel sort of Painted a picture where in a sense we're faced with a dilemma Do we do we have to enter the corporate world in order to be able to understand how to fix it? Do we do this Are we are we compromising our purity of our intentions if we understand how You know the the armaments industry works or something like that and if the criteria is to be effective But the criteria it has to be to be effective from in a spiritually guided And transformative way And that's the challenge we're facing and I think that people like shoe marker Gandy and others actually gave us practical examples of how we can do this on the ground real practical stuff And and also what you were saying rain you is it about integrating Indigenous knowledge. We're trying to do that as well to bring Bring out not just the sort of way that we might be able to adapt to the doom that we're already facing but to Make the transformation ahead of time so we minimize the amount of chaos that we're producing And I think yeah that that really resonates with me jenny that the root of it is actually conscience at spirit And conscience leads us to act Um, so I just want to share that and that the power the potency of that cultivating the potency of that Is I think what I'm calling prophetic voice But um, nancy Thank you, I was really really grateful Our keith that you brought daniel here And began a dialogue with him that I think will circle back into I have heard him a number of times before so Much of what he had to say Was not as hard to hear In a way as it was the first time and there's a certain relief In the the speaking of that and then engaging with it In his models emphasizing strategy He omits another way of thinking That can bring together the guidance of spirit Which is particularly a central in clarity being clear about our goals And then being the right kinds of goals Some of which can be put into words Some of which is a response of the moment of the kind jenny is talking about and he spoke of Where spirit takes you over What I'm interested in the complementarity with it is comparable to strategy is the notion of design Of social design where science All the sciences both the physical the biological The social sciences Each have a contribution To naming the givens the art of design Is comprehending the givens In combination With the aspirations of the heart led by spirit And among the givens understanding the realities Of the situation you're in and the path dependencies and so forth And then with a collective effort of mutual creativity gained by really hearing each other To then begin to lay out what are the system requirements and what are The places in the system of leverage points Where the changes of the right kind could shift the outcomes And at those points what are what I would call at that point design specs for solutions And looking at stories It's important to understand the stories of failure. It is equally important to understand the stories of success I would say to him Look at the open government movement in taiwan Talk about an adjacent possible that just suddenly exploded. Nobody could have guessed not only a different way of governing at scale A truly participatory governance at scale But a different strategy for a kind of different kind of revolution that would occur Look at the reamp project in the u.s. And the notion of collective impact and And the notion of collective impact and Stanford's Social design and so forth. Let us look for those places where there are not only The accidents of the right person at the right place at the right time that history yields But those things that are replicable replicable that suggest These are ways of being together ways of meeting our needs That as I have put it to meet the needs of all by healing not harming Planetary people our material needs. Where are their examples? Of that and then where are the examples? Of as in the reamp project bringing all the elements Of a system that was resulting in horrific pollution in the american midwest Each of them as human beings to come together and jointly map The systems that they were in coming to know each other's human beings and the roles of each and then together saying If we change these leverage points in this system We could dramatically change we could reverse instead of being the most polluting part of the country We could become the model of the opposite as you know Keith. They were stunningly successful They stopped the production that going online of 30 power plants So I want us to study closely where those things do come together And the ways in which deep listening and love towards each other opens up creativity That is otherwise again the adjacent possible. We don't even yet know what it could look like and lastly The situation we confront we're all part of the problem and potentially all part of the solution Is radically different Than confrontational one issue even if the issue is colonialism one issue one shot warfare This is a really different opportunity in human history Thank you so much Nancy for sharing that and I couldn't agree more and I just that that um I do think that that first example about taiwan is actually something I've talked directly to daniel about before Um, so it's something on his radar Brad Uh, I apologize zoom is uh decided again that I shouldn't you shouldn't see me except in a uh a picture So i'm gonna leave the picture there. Um A couple of things struck me in terms of what he what he was saying. Um I was struck by when he grabbed me when he said uh one of our alternatives is to die with dignity um and i'm um And working out of that one of the things that that and then he gave he gave a model I mean he gave a lot of examples But one of the examples he gave I thought was by moving was he said about to bet and how to bet could have anticipated But their culturally weren't set to it, but they could have anticipated by their geographic placement That they were between two major powers and that they were vulnerable and done something about it and interestingly what he Said this they could have gone to europe and asked for um, essentially military support it sounded like. Um, or some kind What i've noticed is and and i've and i've um Is is a lack on On on certain of many of us are not wanting to push back Um, and what I was hearing him say was you need to study The you need to study the the opponents so to speak and you need to understand them in order to know how to how to resist them In a way that's going to actually be effective and what he said was if not being effective is immoral And I and I thought that was extraordinary to say um It always struck me that that obama had told us in his books He was a compromiser and when you have him come into a situation where for a while they His his his party controlled all three Parts of government, you know the executive in both houses and they didn't just do what the What the republicans would have done which is roll over everything they could have just put in you know um Changed medicare and had universal health and two years of it before and then try to take it away They they could have when they were doing the so-called bailout They could have bought out everybody's mortgages Taking over the banks. They had the rules to take over the banks and control them and they didn't do that They they chose to just to give the money to the ceo's to be able to retire and what we and we all kind of Okay That's okay And part of what what really has been bothering me, you know, and I and I I grew up in a union house. I grew up, you know, and my died in the bowl Democrats and Is this that the the fear to be called liberal even it's like, oh, you're a liberal. Oh my god, you know and and running away from it And and the pause what I'm hearing here is we need to resist we need to be more active It doesn't necessarily mean for quakers to take up arms, but it does mean to fight And there are ways to fight without Taking up arms and shooting people, but it doesn't mean rolling over it doesn't mean dying with dignity It doesn't mean letting it happen And and and that's what it's what what I feel I'm surrounded with too often in the so-called liberal world Is that kind of well, let's get along. Let's not make waves. Let's compromise. Let's find a way out and you know And not instead of saying no, this is wrong. We're going to stand up and resist um and remember peace teams one time had a A picture of a girl this is before the current situation of a girl standing in front of a tank in Palestine and and protecting a trying to protect a house and and the tank ran over her and the house And and the line was that they had they posted was people are willing to die for war. How many people are willing to die for peace And it's at that level that we're talking about and I just feel um I just feel like that's what he was asking of us And in between the lines is is to have that kind of same level of energy and commitment To really push back and push back effectively. Thanks Brad, I I just want to say you're speaking to my condition. I um really Really appreciate that and um I'm not going to dominate this conversation, but I want to invite Brian. Yeah I Do want to I believe what Brad was just saying there but I do want to um At least point out that There was an underlying fear That really wasn't being talked about Daniel has of Where we are And I think that it's important that we Understand that fear As we move forward That it's not an excuse for not moving forward But that it's an important thing to understand perhaps that the Time frame that is available to make the changes that are required Is no longer with us And how do we respond to that? The Fear of where we are with AI The fear we are with how much Information needs to be controlled cannot be talked about that he was afraid that He would be recorded and that that might be extended to the rest of the world that he might misspeak And he was afraid of that So I think that we need to understand his fears and we need to understand Should we hold on to those same fears or Is that something that we have something special within our approach That can work past those fears He is speaking to the fact that we need to Completely change the institutions the systemic Approaches that are already in place all need to be changed and they all need to be changed simultaneously and that There's nothing to be left behind that's revolution and Are we willing to step out to the levels of what does that mean and what does that mean within a nonviolent approach And what does that mean to our families and our neighbors And the people that are you know that we love That that we hold dear and what will the consequences be Of what we're going to make for the changes that have to happen To be able to prevent the worst of the things that have been outlined in front of us Just an acknowledgement Thank you Thank you rye, um David Um if you can hear me Um I'm reminded of somebody's quote who suggested an effective strategy Is to develop some sort of system which absolutes the existing system Yeah, yeah We're never going to have the time to develop the skills to be able to Change corporate corporate america from the inside I don't see that as something that makes sense for qe w I'm intrigued by the idea of wilderness There isn't any But at least there's little pieces of nature that still exist For us to develop the kind of intuition that he was talking about by exposure to nature It seems like qe w needs to be Looking for and attempting to preserve What little bits of nature there still are in all growth forests in wilderness Those are the kinds of things that we might be able to be effective in our strategy of Probably not at a federal level but more likely at a local level And pointing out to the society around us That those pieces of nature that still exist have things to teach us and Are beautiful and affect our lives If that makes sense Thank you, David, uh, we have another David Good morning friends 9 33 a.m. Now in Yeah, it was uh I think I will have to try and get in contact with daniel if I know he's a busy man, but his responses about governmental processes fascinate me because i'm certainly fascinated in democratic which seems to me like peaceful ways of You know moving the overton window as it were, you know, what's acceptable. What's not acceptable and so on so forth I do think that 17th century britain was a most fascinating time Because of course it not only gave birth to friends But in many ways it gave birth to at least the beginnings of democracy You know, uh, we basically had the parliament taking the power over the monarch and I think it was you keith who mentioned Hobbes and whatnot earlier, you know, and there's you know, there's a whole lot of changes here that are happening. So I personally am still holding the faith Very much that democracy is still evolving and so I sometimes say that Quakers are my spiritual community which I dearly love Golf is my other religion because on the golf course nearer to thee am I and my lord when I'm In that spiritual space But I will say that modern representative democracy is my true Religion in the latin sense of that word religion, which basically means Bonding what bonds us you know, and I know we are very Symbolic we work through symbolism a lot And so I think always I think my my holy of holies is the two red lines down the center of the house of commons, which are mythologically as it were Two broadswords apart Now the symbolism of that is if you are the Speaker in the house of commons to your right sits his majesty's loyal government and to your left sits his majesty's loyal opposition and So, you know, they clash thoughts But that's the essence of having to live in the age of reason Because if we are to live in the age of reason we must live in the age of contention rivalry because Reason can give a valid answer on both sides And I know many friends here have spoken about as it were think locally act globally, you know now I Warning, I may say something which upsets people here. Okay, but I will say first and foremost I am very very very pro choice okay, and I can respect the united states supreme court's decision To make it a state thing Okay, so I hope that doesn't upset anybody too much But on I would absolutely always go for pro-choice But I see the reasoning in it It's up to you folks individually As states or what have the case would be locally to decide what you as a community wish And I think that is all the way through You know, um, but of course how we're lessing that into a Global public opinion as well is another matter. Anyway enough from me. Thank you And Leoma A couple of things one it seems to me that Finding spaces for you know, like the scientific the internal all these different states doesn't seem to me like such a big conundrum We just I think we might be well suited to find a way to honor all the different ones uh our practice with Unity decision-making might help us be a place where we can help model the structure of Honoring all the different ways of knowing Going with the basic fundamental belief That there is something larger and deeper than us holding us And that we also are not wise enough to know more than part I mean, we're wise enough to know the QEW needs more diversity to have more more contention and more points of view, but um And so that was one thing and the other thing is I've been wondering Considering our size. I mean, I'm troubled by this idea that we need experts um Seems like a Very sound idea. We need experts in how to be effective In the places that are controlling resources Which essentially what the big corporations and governments are they're channeling the way resources go and That but that's very daunting to get the amount of expertise to be Effective there So I'm just putting that up as wow Because if we don't maybe we won't get a chance to do where our strengths is Or where our contribution is but um The other last thing I wanted to put forward is this idea that's been playing with me about As a compliment to the gentle warrior Which Keith seems to be your archetype in some Some days at least um The humble holy trickster Which is the one who's Uh, and there are other archetypes that we might well embrace in there or invent but But the humble holy trickster is the one Who is attuned to the emergence? I've been wondering about emergence as a compliment to good design, which is essential How do we How can qe w as a small organization? catalyze emergence By being alert to places where A small group can shift conversations And connect Groups, I mean we're in our silo. We need to get out of it. How can we connect groups? That When put together might come up with something we don't expect I mean, I think there are ways that emergence can be encouraged and there are ways in which it's Being channeled towards emergence of pathways We all know too well from our history in terms of the rival or stuff that daniel talked about etc but Well, I think our next person is suellin Thank you, liana You Um, I I want to in general say that I keep wanting to say that friend speaks my mind And so and what many of you have said so thank you I have heard Maybe one thing but I also may have misheard it that concerns me And um, and I want to respond to the first query Um So let me say that now and then I can because it relates to what concerned me How could qe w respond with deep earnest? I don't have it in front of me, but deep earnestness to what we just heard from daniel. That's the way I'm going to truncate it And I will say By actually honoring because we don't and no progressive groups do I think That's a black statement that I should don't have the right to move but we don't honor the study of effective strategy as much as we honor Having a phd in science We don't honor that and as a person who has been an organizer since I was 13 years old I will tell you the studies are out there And what they tell you is you'd better read them because for example people always bring up the civil rights movement well guys Read I've got the light of freedom that explained that it worked those marches to a large degree Not their only person. There's never one reason something works to a large degree because for 20 years organizations went into The black towns and did door-to-door canvassing and had community meetings For 20 years before you saw any sit-ins and marches Yet when people think they have studied effective strategy They think they're looking at the surface They haven't studied the effective strategy and we do not as I Well, I don't call myself a liberal anymore because I call myself a lefty because working class of economic things are always in front of me uh, and but what I'm going to say is You can't study it But you can't study it just thinking you kind of know what people have said in a few places You got to really find the studies It took me years to find I've got the light of freedom and the Duke university professor who wrote it And that was 20 years of door knocking that your university professor who wrote it said I have looked for this book for years and I finally decided I had to write it And uh, uh, so you it is not easy, but we cannot tell ourselves surface things If we wanted to change so if we wanted to be earnest We would study effective strategy, but we'd really study it the other thing the thing that has concerned me two things One has been the idea that if we Play in the some of the power circles to try to help things be better And we can't be sure it'll save the world but to do our best and play in some of us We will be corrupt like corporations. I think I've heard that in various words more than once No That isn't at all necessary Instead what we need to do is again go to root cause and figure out why corporations Have so much power. Well partly right They have so much power because they've elected people who care so much about I mean It was so different when I worked for congress when all the members of congress or a lot of them had been Planned by the vant and a vietnam war and the civil rights movements. You guys it was a different world And that's people so we need to respect that Power is a really One of the things to do and I will finally say I do not believe conscience leads to action I believe love Of things like as I said in my five-year thing looking in the eyes of a wolf not frankly to be honest I know often people talking about carbon credits, which I think are really important and stuff because people just go Look in the eyes of the wolf and tell me if it's okay with you Vow's eyes go extinct Because you're approaching love And what I want to say is that We need some love to help There be tactics But as he as Daniel said about the 10,000 things put you in touch with the dow The knocking on the doors The canvas is what puts off is as valid at put for putting us up in touch with spirit as sitting in a me for worship And we don't really All that we don't and I think because it is The story of that I tried to find from organizing is people did a little bit They were reinforced and then they did a little bit more So that door knocking or whatever is where god is I believe I'll go ahead and share just a bit. My hand kept dropping. I think it's because my mic's off Um, and then we're back. I'll invite you but I I really did want to share just a bit that um Yeah, I think I mean, I think that Naomi both knows me well And says it well that I think that the the orientation towards this that I'm called to Is something like a peaceful warrior, which is the one that's willing That you know, there's a beautiful some beautiful quotes from some very peaceful warriors, uh in the 19 Bear uh, I'm trying to remember his first name right now There's a few but you know, essentially, um admonishing Quite, you know peacemakers people who claim to be peacemakers But who are unwilling to pay any significant price for that and they you know claim. I want peace I want peace but they do it with half a heart and half a will and because of that The war continues because all they really want is the volaties of peace all they really want is peace in my little bubble Right and I think as long as that's what we're going for we're actually completely out of line with conscience That's what I I think gardening is a beautiful thing. I think rooting ourself in that deep Groundedness with the earth is so foundational to transforming ourselves and transforming the world But if we're not stepping outside of our bubble We're not aligned with god. We're not aligned with conscience. We're actually just Faking it. We're we're middle-class white people wanting to feel good And so I think Is I hope doesn't admonish people so much that they don't feel that every small thing you do makes a difference Every little thing even if you didn't step You know, you didn't bat your eyelashes to kill that little Or whatever it is everything even if you die tomorrow the little things you did today Made some difference and so that's that's the ground that we work from is that foundation Everything makes a difference but if I'm going to be Absolutely if I'm going to be true to our bigger ancestry and I'm going to give my life to god I'm going to give my life to conscience There can't be any Cans and butts about that. It's actually everything is on the line And that means I'm willing I'm going to recognize that we do live in a world That's much more complicated than it was 100 years ago and if human envy is going to be a good steward of this planet We're probably going to get it need to be a little bit better at sense making what's going on we're also Going to get a lot better at solving our problems interrelationally with one another we're going to have to get better at peacemaking Um, I think that the main thing I would say is you know, we were saying the problem is the institutions The problem isn't the institutions. We don't have a global institution There's its complete rule of power by tooth and claw and in our anarchy and its worst sets At the at the global level That's not that's not entirely true. I want to you know, the un has been amazing There's been things that have progressed us against that trend towards violence um, and and there's really earnest people fighting for that. Um but We need global cooperation If we want to be a wise steward of this planet and to do that we have to do deep peacemaking Not shallow. Oh, why don't you just all get along kind of peacemaking but like Resolving historical trauma kind of peacemaking and creating peace between peoples um And then we have to I think humble ourselves before the living world that we're all apart and realize that there's a wisdom Implicit in all of this that is so much faster Than anything we have to touch with and if we're able to surrender ourselves to that and say that's actually that's the prime objective Is just to be a an instrument of that that's To me what conscience would have me do and I do think I would push back against any one didn't today but I I I see Maybe it's just a mystical sense That uh, the force of non-violence is as of yet Unrealized in its fullness in the world And that's what I want to see qe w leaning into Um not tomorrow but today You And Rebecca I'm realizing sorry I was thank you Rebecca So I want to thank you and I want to thank sue ellen. I think sue ellen you have a lot of wisdom about a strategy for moving forward But I I really want us all to listen to one another by listening in tongues because I'm going to Speak to the first question um I don't usually come to these gatherings, but I I really felt compelled after listening to a Presentation daniel spoke That was sent to me So I came tonight I'm a part of new england yearly meeting on abinackey unceded territory and in their earth care ministry committee And um number one I've got three points one is that The love of god However, you interpret that Calms our fears Calms our fears The second point as a social scientist I really believe in something that he's just shared about We need to create places of trauma informed gatherings That are part of our Specialties Our specialties as scientists Whether that be social or natural Or physical sciences Whether that be as farmers Or as Pastors or as Economists Whatever that is To humbly sit together And listen for spirit to talk to us deeply And then come together and share those truths That we have discerned That will move us forward On a path That maybe able to speak to some of those entities that Know our language and would be able to hear us From the voice that we have that is somewhat unique as a people of faith And lastly Live into those paradigms that we have discerned Through the spirit That we don't have to keep doing what is being done We can move in that new way just like our early early forebears Moved in a different Way than the culture around them We can do the same We can be known as those wacky quakers Don't quite walk the same walk or talk the same talk That was number three so anyway, thank you very much. Thank you for this program I'm noticing that Juniper is on the move but Chamba, Nora and Juniper's hand is raised. Nora, are you wanting to share? Yeah, sorry Juniper was needing constant movement right now and I wasn't going to be able to think in So dad took him for a second I I mean what what was really pulling at me raising my hand um Why was my hand was I think that I actually don't want to frame it that way. I I have a deep felt knowing I'm not even going to say sense. I have a I have a deeply felt knowing um That Quakers are being called and have been just for some time to get really uncomfortable And I think that's been dawning on us slower than it should be slower than it needs to be Um, I mean, I think it there's of course I've heard echoes of that today already, but there's a There's a deep discomfort that we need to step into And I think QEW is a part of that. I think we I think any moment that we feel righteous we should question And I heard that in Daniel's talk around You know, if you think that you if you think you know, you're probably causing harm We are having a conversation in this house. I think it was last night my sense of time is a little weird since having a baby. Um Um But we are having a conversation about different Different cultures in different ways of Of just approaching things and And how what we think is like what's needed Is coming from our own cultural frame and I think those kinds of conversations are really important But I think that we can't get too hung up on trying to be so perfect as to know everyone's cultural frame As to know What's going to be the deep understanding that's underneath all of it. It's okay. We have our cultural frame If someone came into our circle, they were like, well for my political frame, this is what we understand We wouldn't say, oh, well, let's go deeper than that because that's not That's cultural frame. That's not valid. We we'd say, oh, thank you so much for bringing that We need to get uncomfortable enough to say This is my frame This is where I'm coming from and I'm a piece of the puzzle and I'm gonna step in And that's uncomfortable. It's so uncomfortable to claim something because when you claim something you can be ostracized for it And actually you're gonna have to change it the moment you claim it You have to change it because the moment you claim it you start learning about it and you start learning about yourself Oh, this is my experience of being human And then it starts to shift and how uncomfortable to be on shifting sand all the time But I think that's where god wants us to go. I think that's where spirit always has lived You You think there's other things that that come to me about the whole question of rite of passage and and And the frame of a rite of passage feels really powerful, but um Honestly, none of that is feeling very led for me to say so I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna stop there As your partner, I'm very moved Um, that was really powerful Thor Man so many many good people that talks tonight. I just I'm thoroughly impressed I'm gonna summon up the game of rock paper scissors because A lot of us would like to pick up a sword and battle it out, but that's just not Politically correct anymore, especially in a democracy So that we switch over the paper and it's really a political legislative process Getting out the vote going to door to door getting the right people in congress and we already know what they're gonna vote on They're gonna vote for reforms. They're gonna do the right thing or close enough. That's how represented democracy works And some of us well, let's just say rock is easier to break up than to change your mind We've got brains. We soak up information Um, I mean I I I was faced with a genetic condition my son. I went into a medical library No background in medicine 10 hours later. I had the diagnosis I can do those kind of mental gymnastics Most people can't Most people can't spend a couple hours a day just trying to keep current on what's going on out there in the science world But I find hope in knowing what's going on Even if it's in the early stages, you know, vanadium peroxide soaks up carbon dioxide Maybe it's a good thing. Maybe it's not but I'm sure it's going to be either replaced by something better or it will do That that's the realm of people spend two hours a day every day Soaking up information because that's something I'm good at So I'm a rock. I know it. I'm a lousy politician and I certainly don't want to go with a broadsword out there But we got a system of domination. It's a kinder, gentler one. We see it in our housing. We see it in our financial system We see it in our retirement system And I I I love the problems we have in the United States solely because I know they're worse everywhere else. They go in the world so I'm just saying being aware is so powerful And getting out and you know, if you're really going to say you love your neighbor You're willing to get outside. You're a little little bubble And I hear you say you love nature, but I really like meeting people that are really different than me They think differently. They're culturally different That's what's really going to change and I think that is the the singular strength of a group like this is we can get out and meet our neighbors And we can make a persuasive story that you know I think God calls us to be a servant We are called to do the right thing. We're not supposed to be a reactionary. We're not supposed to be afraid to change We don't have such rocks, you know Set rules about the way it should be like it was in 1940 And that is I think you're this the signature power of this group I don't know. I got I'm really impressed You Thank you Thor we'll keep in conversation. Um, uh, allen Oh, I was kind of hoping you wouldn't call on me I I've I've been listening to everyone and really appreciating all the deep and moving wisdom and the um And and I feel like what I mostly have to bring is uh confusion and I'm I'm kind of wrestling deeply with a lot of what uh Daniel brought forth, but um there's Part of me that is pushing back Against uh, I found I found a lot of our conversations and but there's been little glimmerings Of something else, but I found a lot of them tonight to be very human bounded um That uh, when I look from my geo and it's really I think more my geological perspective than my quaker perspective this kind of pushing back on that that uh, when I look at nature I don't see um Well competition is certainly the norm, but it's always eventually ultimately bounded and cooperation Is also the norm and um I think this it's not just human bounded but time bounded but that In the rise of western civilization there was this domination mindset that emerged and it's uh, it's a fire and the um lack of fire It's burning Literally, I mean every time we drive a car We're burning the earth and Like all fires It's a Daniel referred to exponential growth a number of times. This is growing exponentially that is growing exponentially and I think uh for years I taught my students that all exponential growth Is ultimately self limiting that nothing can grow exponentially and it's only in the last year That I realized that was wrong That there's another kind of fire That uh, there are things it's only things That consume That can't grow exponentially things that produce Things that are generative love No No wisdom, I won't say know how know how governed by wisdom That can grow exponentially And so the question the confusion the thing I'm wrestling with I have I keep having this image of moses In the uh Meeting the burning bush And it was a burning with a fire that did not consume And my theory of that my thought of that has always been that what was transformational there Was not that that bush was any different than any other bush or any tree Any animal or any being including us Is that moses Saw the life force in it Whether there was some Sometimes I've looked at our redbud trees and In spring and I've thought oh, is that the burning bush? Is that the That life force And he recognized The spirit In that The god and he took off his shoes to make himself more like the bush to grow to find that deep rooting And I there there he was often the wilderness in some ways. I think you're one person Meeting god Yet he transformed the world from that experience And I think that fire and genia alluded to it and other people alluded to it ultimately I think it's love And So my question is what kind of fire burns in us I I'll just leave it with that I'm just gonna share something and I think when you're talking about cooperative and competitive forces But I think in I mean sew on if you feel called, please do share but I'm thinking that that might have been That might have been our moment Just leave it with what I'll say. So if you want to share though, please do great. Well All right, Thor if you're willing Is it a final? Just a final piece Yep final piece and it's kind of a prayer I'm going to just relate That after my first son died I gave thanks to him I gave thanks for his life I gave thanks for the influence it had on me And it felt like the sky burned So when I read that mozo saw the burning bush I know he was in that mindset To be thankful for the things that we all fear The things that scare us the things that challenge us And I've never felt so in awe and so strong in my life as that day And that's what I wish for you and all the challenges we face That you look them in and understand them and give thanks for them Because we are born in a time where there's good great promise and great challenge And if you are so blessed The sky will burn for you You You You I was gonna post this in the chat, but I couldn't find it. I just didn't want to disturb the silence, but There's a prayer from pema children that she shares In her book the places that scare you and she says May the roots of all suffering diminish May hatred violence addiction and neglect also decrease And we see all that separates us as as insubstantial as our dreams May we go to the places that scare us May you be a warrior of light", "segments":
