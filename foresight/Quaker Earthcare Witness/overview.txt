Checking Quaker Earthcare Witness/A Civilizational Rite of Passage -  Daniel Schmachtenberger's Keynote to QEW Spring Gathering 2024.txt
1. The speaker reflects on the human-bounded perspective, particularly from a geological and Quaker viewpoint, noting that while competition is prevalent in nature, cooperation is also a fundamental aspect. They mention the rise of Western civilization's domination mindset, which has led to environmentally destructive behavior, symbolized by the burning of fossil fuels.

2. The speaker contrasts exponential growth with generative growth, arguing that only the latter, represented by love and wisdom, can be truly sustainable. They draw an analogy between this and the story of Moses and the Burning Bush, suggesting that what was transformational about the experience was not the bush itself but Moses' recognition of the life force within it.

3. The speaker then shares a personal experience where they found gratitude in the face of their son's death, which evoked a sense of awe and strength. They encourage others to find strength in understanding and giving thanks for the challenges they face.

4. Finally, the speaker recites a prayer from Pema Chödrön's "The Places That Scare You," asking for a diminishment of all suffering, hatred, violence, addiction, and neglect, and for the recognition of what separates us as insubstantial as our dreams. They invite everyone to go to the places that scare them and be warriors of light.

In summary, the speaker discusses the interplay between competition and cooperation in nature, the destructive nature of Western civilization's dominant mindset, the concept of exponential versus generative growth, the transformative power of love and wisdom, and ultimately offers a message of hope and resilience through gratitude and facing our fears with light. They also share a poignant prayer for overcoming suffering and fostering understanding and compassion.
